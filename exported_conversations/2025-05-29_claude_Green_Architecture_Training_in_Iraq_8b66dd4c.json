The program reframes traditional elements as sophisticated, modern solutions while providing practical tools for implementation within a $2000 budget.\n\n## Day 1: Building trust through heritage innovation\n\n**Morning Session: Reframing Sustainability as Sophistication (4 hours)**\nStart with success stories from prestigious regional projects. Present Masdar City's 51% energy reduction and the Al Bahr Towers' dynamic facades as examples of how traditional principles enhance modern luxury. Introduce the concept of \"heritage luxury\" - where courtyards become \"executive wellness spaces\" and mashrabiya screens become \"precision environmental control systems.\"\n\n**Practical Exercise 1: Thermal Imaging Discovery**\nUsing FLIR ONE thermal cameras ($250), participants examine local buildings to visualize heat loss through large windows versus traditional designs. This creates immediate, visual evidence of performance differences that architects can show clients.\n\n**Afternoon Session: Climate Response Fundamentals**\nFocus on Mosul's specific conditions: summer temperatures reaching 42.9°C, winter lows of 2.2°C, and frequent dust storms. Demonstrate how traditional Iraqi architecture evolved to handle these extremes through hands-on material testing using the insulation demonstration kit.\n\n**Client Communication Workshop 1: The Status Reframe**\nRole-play scenario where architects present smaller windows as \"Swiss bank vault security features\" and \"acoustic privacy enhancement\" rather than energy-saving measures. Practice using language that emphasizes exclusivity: \"This design provides the privacy that only the most discerning homeowners demand.\"\n\n## Day 2: Passive design as high-tech innovation\n\n**Morning Session: Courtyard Design Workshop**\nTransform the traditional courtyard concept into a modern amenity. Design a 6m x 6m courtyard for a 150m² home, positioning it as a \"biophilic wellness center\" with evaporative cooling that reduces temperatures by 3-5°C. Use cardboard models and fans to demonstrate airflow patterns.\n\n**Cost-Benefit Calculator Development**\nCreate customized spreadsheets showing that sustainable features in a $50,000 home add only $5,000 upfront but save $1,500 annually - a 3-year payback period. Include property value increases of 3-7% as an investment incentive.\n\n**Afternoon Session: Modern Mashrabiya Design**\nStudy the Institut du Monde Arabe's 27,000 light-sensitive diaphragms as inspiration. Design contemporary screen patterns using local geometric motifs, emphasizing how this provides both cultural identity and reduces cooling loads by 15-25%.\n\n**Client Communication Workshop 2: The Investment Pitch**\nPractice presenting lifecycle costs versus first costs. Use this script template: \"While this adds 10% to your initial investment, you'll see 40% energy savings annually. More importantly, your home will maintain a stable 24-26°C year-round, creating the comfort level expected in luxury hotels.\"\n\n## Day 3: Local materials as authentic luxury\n\n**Morning Session: Material Innovation Lab**\nTest local sustainable materials including stabilized earth blocks, date palm fiber insulation, and recycled content from post-conflict debris. Position these as \"authentic Mesopotamian luxury\" with 5,000 years of proven performance.\n\n**Dust Storm Protection Systems**\nAddress a critical Mosul concern by designing integrated protection using MERV 13-16 filtration systems and positive pressure strategies. Frame this as \"NASA-grade air quality systems\" to appeal to technology-conscious clients.\n\n**Afternoon Session: Window Optimization Challenge**\nDesign window systems achieving optimal daylighting with minimal heat gain. Calculate that north-facing windows at 20-30% of wall area provide excellent light while east/west windows limited to 10-15% prevent overheating. Use light meters to demonstrate quality versus quantity of natural light.\n\n**Client Communication Workshop 3: Heritage Prestige**\nPractice connecting traditional building wisdom to family legacy: \"This design incorporates the same principles that kept your ancestors comfortable for millennia, updated with 21st-century technology. It's not just a house; it's a continuation of Iraqi architectural excellence.\"\n\n## Day 4: Integration and application\n\n**Morning Session: Renewable Energy as Independence**\nDesign a 4-6kW solar system for a 150m² home, emphasizing energy independence during Mosul's reconstruction. Position this as \"executive-level infrastructure resilience\" rather than environmental activism.\n\n**The 150m² Sustainable Home Project**\nTeams develop complete designs incorporating:\n- East-west orientation minimizing western exposure\n- Central courtyard with water feature\n- Modern interpretation of wind catchers\n- Strategic window placement with deep overhangs\n- Local material specifications\n\n**Afternoon Session: Advanced Client Negotiation**\nComplex role-play scenarios including family decision-makers, addressing concerns about \"looking traditional.\" Practice pivot strategies: when clients resist courtyards, present them as \"private outdoor entertainment zones\" with \"resort-style ambiance.\"\n\n**Financial Modeling Mastery**\nDevelop detailed proposals showing how sustainable features reduce operational costs by $1,050-1,700 annually, making homes more attractive to potential buyers and increasing resale value.\n\n## Day 5: Presentation excellence and networking\n\n**Morning Session: Visual Communication Skills**\nCreate compelling before/after visualizations showing energy bills, comfort levels, and maintenance costs. Use thermal imaging results from Day 1 to create powerful visual narratives.\n\n**Final Project Presentations**\nTeams present their 150m² home designs to a panel including local architecture firm representatives. Evaluation criteria:\n- Cultural sensitivity and modern appeal (25%)\n- Technical sustainability integration (25%)\n- Cost-effectiveness and payback analysis (25%)\n- Client communication effectiveness (25%)\n\n**Afternoon Session: Building Your Sustainable Practice**\nDevelop individual action plans for implementing sustainable design in current projects. Create client education materials emphasizing that sustainable features are investments in comfort, health, and property value rather than environmental compromises.\n\n**Network Building**\nEstablish mentorship connections with experienced sustainable architects. Create a WhatsApp group for ongoing peer support and resource sharing.\n\n## Day 6 Optional: Design competition\n\n**Competition Brief: The New Mosul Home**\nDesign a 150m² residence that honors Mesopotamian heritage while exceeding international sustainability standards. Requirements include:\n- Maximum 20% window-to-wall ratio\n- Integration of at least three passive cooling strategies\n- Use of 60% local materials\n- Detailed cost-benefit analysis\n- Client presentation materials positioning sustainable features as luxury amenities\n\n**Judging Panel**\nLocal architecture firms evaluate entries based on marketability, technical excellence, and cultural appropriateness. Winners receive recognition and potential employment opportunities.\n\n## Key tools and materials (within $2000 budget)\n\n**Essential Equipment:**\n- FLIR ONE thermal cameras: $250\n- Insulation demonstration kit: $150\n- Solar heat gain demonstrator: $200\n- Light meters and measurement tools: $100\n- Model-making materials: $400\n- Presentation equipment: $350\n- Competition materials: $450\n- Shipping/contingency: $100\n\n**Free Software Suite:**\n- Energy3D for 3D modeling and energy simulation\n- OpenStudio + EnergyPlus for professional analysis\n- Climate Consultant for site-specific data\n- Customized Excel templates for cost calculations\n\n## Overcoming resistance: Proven strategies\n\n**The Luxury Reframe:** Never mention \"traditional\" - use \"heritage-inspired innovation,\" \"culturally-intelligent design,\" or \"place-specific luxury\"\n\n**The Investment Angle:** Lead with ROI, property value increases, and operational savings rather than environmental benefits\n\n**The Comfort Focus:** Emphasize stable temperatures, acoustic privacy, and air quality as primary benefits\n\n**The Status Enhancement:** Reference international awards, prestigious projects, and how sustainable features signal sophisticated, forward-thinking ownership\n\n## Post-training support structure\n\n**Monthly Virtual Sessions:** Ongoing case study reviews and troubleshooting\n\n**Mentorship Program:** Pairing with experienced architects who've successfully implemented sustainable projects in conservative markets\n\n**Resource Library:** Continuously updated database of cost comparisons, case studies, and client communication scripts\n\n**Success Tracking:** Document implemented projects to build local precedents and references\n\nThis refined training module transforms junior architects into confident advocates for sustainable design by providing practical tools, cultural strategies, and economic arguments that resonate with Mosul's specific context. By reframing sustainability as sophistication rather than sacrifice, participants learn to create buildings that honor heritage while exceeding modern performance standards."

If He wanted God , how did you mess up the schedule? Oh, but, oh, thank God, God willing, I mean the time is a little bit appropriate, I don't have a hobby, I have time now, but yeah, it's almost 5:20. Let's see uh \r\n\r\n00:10:38 AHMED AL -OBAIDY \r\n. \r\nIssam 00:10:41 \r\n\r\nBILAL Oh \r\n, oh, don't you remember this program? Oh, \r\n\r\noh ... Engineering And the construction that basically includes insulators? Anything structural engineering. Anything related to quality, standard parameters, engineering specifications, these, these specializations that you can benefit from. What can you do? Yes? \r\n\r\n00:11:46 BILAL \r\n. You are ... \r\n\r\n00:11:47 AHMED AL-OBAIDY . \r\nYou are... Today , yes , would you like to, yes? Which of these specializations can you benefit from? Through the information that I can provide you, what's up with you? \r\n\r\n00:12:01 BILAL \r\nYes training Oh, I mean for oh for engineering and architecture, I mean I did training before, oh most of the thing is you work practically, God \r\n\r\n00:12:10 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. I 100% have courses, I have been giving courses for ten years or more, you could say I give lectures in colleges, in universities in colleges, oh in seminars, in workshops, yes this is my system, I mean \r\n\r\n00:12:30 BILAL \r\nWhat? last Training you provided? What were its topics? \r\n\r\n00:12:34 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. A? Other The training was about how to integrate newly graduated engineers, how to integrate them into the job market? And how to gain a solid scientific specialization, while knowing the prices, requirements, and needs of the private sector, in institutions, agencies, and companies. This is the last workshop I will work in. \r\n\r\n00:13:07 BILAL \r\nOh. that God willing , they benefited from your experience, and of course, I was very excited to do this workshop. \r\n\r\n00:13:17 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nHi tattoos There was no verse a while ago, about two weeks ago, at the kind invitation of the publisher, even on Instagram, and on my page, at the kind invitation of the Faculty of Noor University, and I gave the lecture with Professor Dr. Saad Al-Ta’an, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, \r\n\r\n00:13:37 BILAL \r\n. He wanted God What \r\n\r\n00:13:38 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nwanted God He was previously the ambassador's diplomatic attaché to Iraq. So, was there a specialization and a positive message at the same time? \r\n\r\n00:13:49 BILAL \r\nSo, it is... It means It's similar to the project that we're working on at ITC, trying to connect engineering, architecture, etc. I mean, how will people find work and what kind of work \r\n\r\nis this ? 00:14:03 AHMED AL-OBAIDY\r\nCan I help you with this topic in particular? \r\n\r\n00:14:08 BILAL \r\nI mean How? If you explain to me? \r\n\r\n00:14:10 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nHow to provide Job opportunities , how to enter the market, how? Breaking the barrier, the decline, the fear of the market, and the stereotypical construction, meaning today the graduate who goes out into the market has a fear of the market, how does he deal with the market? I can help you with all of these things. In contrast to that. Insulators or the culture of modern contemporary construction that is mixed with sustainable energy, the clean green environment, etc., I can help you with this topic. Especially if your program does not like to give summaries, does not like to give boring details, and you tire the trainees, \r\n\r\n00:15:01 BILAL \r\n. If He was We have five days, six days, what do you suggest for us? Our goal is to create job opportunities for people, engineers, and architects, so that they can find work and build green houses. This goal means green houses, and we have five days of work. \r\n\r\n00:15:24 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. What do you do? a point System ? The point? In my opinion, there are professors in architecture whose experience you can benefit from. These are in the field of architecture. I work in the field of engineering management. I can give you yes, and you can bring another team or us, or you can, I mean, see, I don't know the pattern that you are working on in order to work on clean energy, today, environmentally friendly. Since today you want to work on institutional work, one of the priorities of work in engineering projects is providing specialists, and providing a suitable environment for communities, including energy or a clean environment, and renewable energy \r\n\r\n00:16:19 BILAL \r\n. With this The field , we may need other trainers, but you work more \r\n\r\n00:16:23 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. On \r\n\r\n00:16:24 BILAL \r\ntraining , money Meaning ? \r\n\r\n00:16:27 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Management Mr Bilal . Yes, today I am giving you this speech so that your program is more solid. And two, you take more clash. Today, I want to talk to you. Today I am a civil engineer, office manager. I cannot talk a lot about architectural engineering, because my specialty is not architecture. On the other hand, there are professors and Dr. Bassam Al-Hafez and others whose duties, remember? This is a professor and assistant dean. You can benefit from this in the field of architectural engineering. What will you benefit from here? It provides valuable and abundant information that gives solidity as well as specialization to the trainees. Added, so every team that comes has a direction, relationships, and an audience that can be attracted to your project more. I mean, the impact of the echo is greater. \r\n\r\n00:17:25 BILAL \r\nAl the People who enter the field, I mean training with you, do you follow up with them? With them, I mean the work environment, what are the types of work that \r\n\r\n00:17:35 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nasked you Question ? If there are no job opportunities, why do we waste time? Hahaha? \r\n\r\n00:17:42 BILAL \r\nYes Right ? Right, but? \r\n\r\n00:17:45 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. But if Do you think all trainees deserve this work? I mean, for every course we offer, we have two lines. Our line is to qualify people, we choose the distinguished people, and the other line is to give to companies, agencies, and institutions. They ask us for a need for creative graduate engineers, so we take from them and give. We take from them and give, a passive exchange between the two parties, and we are positive mediators, yes, without compensation. At the same time, we want to search for value and provide a more solid society. \r\n\r\n00:18:27 BILAL It \r\n's nice . So, what do you mean then? \r\n\r\n00:18:29 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. I after Project , what do I think about the material? This is my entire project for free. How do I think about this project? I was exhausted at the beginning of my graduation, hahaha, when I reached my goals. I want to reduce the barriers, obstacles, and difficulties for new graduates, while providing a somewhat suitable environment for engineering. \r\n\r\n00:18:53 BILAL \r\n. You You see In Iraq, there is a need for graduates who know this green house, the house, the heritage that we are talking about, if \r\n\r\n00:19:05 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Of course. Few \r\n\r\n00:19:06 BILAL \r\nWhat Dr. I don't know if there are black people? \r\n\r\n00:19:08 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Yes Ako There is, but there is a weakness in guidance, there is a weakness in those who are responsible for this project and its development, there is a weakness in marketing, I mean today it has been transferred to you that there is no work in the market, it is not good. I tell you no, there is work, but there are people who do not know how to work and there are people who do not know how to market themselves, right? Yes \r\n\r\n00:19:32 BILAL \r\n. Yes . I mean, they have to meet in the middle. There are people who have to do marketing, and then there has to be an acquaintance \r\n\r\n. 00:19:38 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. We'll add . knowledge Another point , today we are conducting these courses, there is a saying that says that shyness wastes half the opportunities, so we are the ones who want to strengthen the courage of the person opposite us so that we can seize opportunities in a safer and faster way. Yes \r\n\r\n00:19:57 BILAL \r\n. Right . Right, so. I mean this. This is from management training and what color should one be, I mean what color should a sales person be? Be actually this \r\n\r\n00:20:06 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. I Yummy All these things \r\n\r\n00:20:08 BILAL \r\n. Yes . any This is a very, very important part, because if you have something better that you want to sell, but no one knows that you have it, it won't be sold, it won't go \r\n\r\n00:20:18 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n100 before 100, right? \r\n\r\n00:20:19 BILAL \r\n. Coffee \r\n\r\n00:20:20 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nAnd after What ? That we? \r\n\r\n00:20:22 BILAL \r\n. For For training What you do, what you like to do, you say this is one of the most powerful things I can offer. \r\n\r\n00:20:29 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. I have a lot Things I can offer, very powerful for you, but tell me what is your program? I offer you things that benefit your program. I want to serve your program more, I mean. Its level of specialized and scientific solidity should be higher. For example, today I am giving you in the field of construction what serves you, what it does not need, knowing that it is a very important subject, construction. No, today I am working for you on the subject of marketing, engineering management, how to integrate into society. While dealing with all segments of society. How to obtain scientific and specialized solidity by following the example of some specialists and reading their biographies, then complying with some of their actions. You see what serves you more, I will enter between it. So cheating \r\n\r\n00:21:30 BILAL \r\n. Service the goal Like I said, we said that there are people who graduated like you, I don’t know, ten years ago, hahaha \r\n\r\n00:21:38 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nWhat? Time ? 16 years? Yes? \r\n\r\n00:21:40 BILAL \r\nYes? What? His name is A? They started with A in engineering. If they were architects, they would just find work. We want them to find green work. This is the goal. A, so? \r\n\r\n00:21:51 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Work. Green . But if it worked in \r\n\r\n00:21:54 BILAL \r\n. No. a job Green with the project, we are trying to integrate them, and \r\n\r\n00:22:00 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n, the year So what would be more comprehensive? \r\n\r\n00:22:04 BILAL \r\n. Yes . she She is \r\n\r\n00:22:04 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. But then We branch out in the green \r\n\r\n00:22:07 BILAL \r\nWe change it . It. There will be work with the construction, and the engineering, the houses, the experts, these are the ones that cannot be changed, this, the important thing is in my hands hahaha yeah \r\n\r\n00:22:25 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nThere is no , yeah Problem ? \r\n\r\n00:22:26 BILAL \r\nYes , but This goal, what do you expect people to need? A, B, they learn it B towards this goal. So we talked a little bit about management, about what one can do advertising and sell and not be ashamed. But what do you expect in terms of, I mean, day to day? In training, what do you expect is the main goal, yes, for the days? \r\n\r\n00:22:54 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nWhat? Who Needs ? \r\n\r\n00:22:56 BILAL \r\nThis is the main \r\n\r\ngoal . Let's say it's five days. Every day we have a goal, yes. And all the goals must be directed towards this idea, whether it's private sector businesses or building green houses. This is this direction with 00:23:13 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. You You want From me, that means five lectures? \r\n\r\n00:23:15 BILAL \r\n. That means No ? Not all of them are from you. But I want to see if you have an idea, if you have these five days \r\n\r\n00:23:21 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nor all Day , huh? \r\n\r\n00:23:23 BILAL \r\nWhat? Expect We can do things to benefit people. So, can they find work building green houses? So, is there this? I mean, psychological trust in management, and what else? \r\n\r\n00:23:41 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Trust. And management . And scientific integrity. And the other point. Ah, the accounting. Any person, no matter how successful an engineer he is, if he is not honest and his accounting is not disciplined, then he will be blamed for his project not going well or he will always encounter obstacles and problems. \r\n\r\n00:24:12 BILAL \r\nYes , so do you mean the accounting and the envy of the sales people have to be there? \r\n\r\n00:24:17 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Accounting , of course. Today, how do you work? But today I want to talk to you. If I didn’t want to work, earn, and benefit, I wouldn’t be able to. It \r\n\r\n’s not right. I mean, all of these points must be reduced in consideration . 00:24:31 BILAL\r\nHow? One if he has a project. A workshop in management. How can he be sure that it is sustainable? What does money mean? How much? I mean, should I take a private margin or how much? \r\n\r\n00:24:44 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. This he The success of all institutions is based on this point, which is sustainability, the sustainability and continuity of projects \r\n\r\n00:24:53 BILAL \r\n. I expect this The important thing is two things, I mean they can find work, if they have the ability and the willingness to \r\n\r\n00:25:01 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. establish it , yes . What is establishing and marketing projects? \r\n\r\n00:25:09 BILAL \r\nHi , hi Very important, I expect we've arrived on the... on the five days, but like you said, there's a lot of people like Dr. Bassam, I expect they'll be able to get in? \r\n\r\n00:25:21 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nBassam The preserver He serves you a lot. He doesn't just serve you. Yes, he is a respectable and dignified person, and at the same time, yes, he provides you with some of the... yes, the needs for the goals that you set? \r\n\r\n00:25:37 BILAL \r\nAl-Hamd For God God willing, we will contact him again to see if he can help me. I will be coming in the middle of July, and the period is that in the middle of July we will meet, and people, yes, and we will see, meaning that we will be the group of people who will provide the training. So, God willing, we will see you when... \r\n\r\n00:26:03 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nI arrive You Meaning ? \r\n\r\n00:26:05 BILAL \r\nall days Just one day , it would be a lot if you helped share information, I mean one of the things that you can do, \r\n\r\n00:26:12 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. You expect successful Professor Bilal. I even took lectures in psychology, I mean how to persuade, how to persuade. How to conduct a dialogue? How to manage a session. I have information about it. I mean I studied a lot, so I have information that I will present to you, God willing, but it should be in harmony with saving time, because I told you my system is for me, meaning at 11:00 \r\n\r\n00:26:39 BILAL \r\n. If I see it I see it , I mean if it's in the table \r\n\r\n00:26:41 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Ours \r\n\r\n00:26:42 BILAL \r\n. I feel With it . Thank God. Thank you for your time, and it means that \r\n\r\n00:26:46 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\nwanted God Thank you . This point is not to be pardoned. I am a servant of any positive message to communities and building the ah engineering specialties. On the contrary, it is more honorable for me. \r\n\r\n00:26:57 BILAL \r\nmeans I have I have two questions, and if we finish, God willing, the first question is that we have graduates from this project. Do you have any villages where you can take internships? Yes, they can work with you. Is that possible? \r\n\r\n00:27:13 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Country , look. I will tell you, I will tell you, a professor with no job, any distinguished and creative person, I will withdraw him without getting back to you. But if he is not distinguished and creative, I will try to provide him as much as possible, employment opportunities with friends and acquaintances \r\n\r\n00:27:32 BILAL \r\n. This something Very , very nice, because in the end, one might learn something, but he needs to work a little, and learn from people. Of course, he works in the market, I mean the real thing, and then he goes \r\n\r\n00:27:42 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Yuli what It unites communities. Right? Right \r\n\r\n00:27:45 BILAL \r\n. It is necessary. Transfer it . These are opportunities. Congratulations. So, with you or with your friends? That means we will bring you graduates, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:27:55 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. If He wanted God \r\n\r\n00:27:58 BILAL \r\n. And the thing the second This is the information, I mean this information, how is it one? I mean, your numbers are not necessary, but you said that there is movement in the Iraqi market, so in order for us to encourage people to enter, and I mean, to know that there is a market, we must show them numbers, I mean, how big is this market, how many people, and where? Which areas do you want, I mean, on Ya Beband Al-Duq, so I don’t know if \r\n\r\n00:28:22 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. All of it. I can help you with it. Yes, you are talking about a topic that I live by. Yes, right? Yes, the idea is clear \r\n\r\n. 00:28:30 BILAL \r\n. So any Yes, I don’t know how, I mean, if I try to arrange this training, and I wanted to put, I mean, part of the field on this topic, I mean, the size of the market, do you have numbers to share with me? I mean, can you share it with me now? I mean, by voice, I mean, fill me in \r\n\r\n00:28:46 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. no It's possible at another time. For example, if you have any questions, I'll ask you the same questions you want. When I have free time, I'll answer them in the same session. I have another meeting. So, to make sure the time is flexible, I can give you more accurate answers. \r\n\r\n00:29:02 BILAL \r\n. Yes . that God willing , I will make it something written for you to read me a message. At any time you want, we don’t have time , God willing, at the appropriate time for you \r\n\r\n00:29:17 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. He wanted God \r\n\r\n00:29:18 BILAL \r\n. I have it . meeting After a while, go and drink. \r\n\r\n00:29:21 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Come on . Yes, by God. Yes. \r\n\r\n00:29:24 BILAL \r\nSorry , I tortured you. With us today only? \r\n\r\n00:29:26 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. Thank you. For you . No, no, on the contrary, it is my pleasure. No, no, on the contrary. \r\n\r\n00:29:30 BILAL \r\n. Always . I am happy Who can I talk to? And my people \r\n\r\n00:29:33 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n. We are here. my eyes God willing, at your service. \r\n\r\n00:29:36 BILAL . \r\nAnd every success , God willing, without a day in the hereafter, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:29:38 AHMED AL-OBAIDY \r\n.

Peace be upon you Laith \r\n\r\n00:01:44 SPK_2 \r\nPeace be upon you, welcome, how are you? \r\n\r\n00:01:46 SPK_1 \r\nHow are you? \r\n\r\n00:01:50 SPK_3 \r\n. And thank you very much \r\n\r\n00:01:51 SPK_1 \r\nOh, thank God, you are in Mosul. Yes, in Mosul, thank God, thank God, you know them, I mean, Abdullah is from Mosul Space, and I mean, the Al-A association is there \r\n\r\n00:02:06 SPK_3 \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n00:02:06 SPK_1 \r\n. Thank God, thank God that it has been, I don’t know, the last time I came to Mosul, but it wasn’t a long time ago, maybe, I mean, last year, and the first time I was sick, but thank God I heard about the recess and the Great Mosque of al-Nuri \r\n\r\n00:02:21 SPK_3 \r\n. Sweet \r\n\r\n00:02:22 SPK_2 \r\n. Very good? Yes, God willing, your visit to the city of Mosul was successful and beautiful, and recently, yes, you opened the Al-Nuri Mosque and also the Al-Hadba Minaret \r\n\r\n00:02:30 SPK_1 \r\nWow wow. I must go back again. But God willing, we will see when. Four months, seven, God willing. Or let me just tell you a little bit about myself. I want to work with the... It is part of the United Nations. They want to work on a project. What do they want? I mean, to develop construction and green biomes and... Or what do they mean, to open up job opportunities and jobs for young people? These two, together, this is the goal with the project. And what did you hear about the house project? \r\n\r\n00:03:09 SPK_2 \r\n, which is the same as the one about sustainable development? \r\n\r\n00:03:15 SPK_1 \r\nYes, in this house project we have reached a stage where, yes, we are trying to find people to help us with training, yes, and we found three, yes, I mean, training opportunities. The first one is solar, the second is insulation, and yes, the third, mm, this third, but yes, yes, yes, the part is more than the most confusing thing for me, so I need your help to understand the subject more, yes, see what the color is, yes, I mean, we started with the training and we have training, or are you present? You want to hear from me, have you done training in green building, do you have any experience in this field? \r\n\r\n00:04:05 SPK_2 \r\n. First of all, Professor Bilal, let me introduce myself. My name is Laith Abdullah, born in Mosul in 2000. Of course, yes, I worked in or studied architectural engineering at the Northern Technical University. Yes, I obtained an engineering diploma in architectural drawing. \r\n\r\n00:04:27 SPK_3 \r\n. And. And currently \r\n\r\n00:04:29 SPK_2 \r\n. I'm studying at an international university, an online international course, specializing in sustainable development. Um, so I'm trying to combine the two things in my work so that we can combat this climate change that's happening and reduce the difficulties, and the charlancy that we face, yes, through our green designs \r\n\r\n00:04:52 SPK_1 \r\n. Except the line gets cut off a little bit, I mean it's not cut off, but the sound keeps coming and going, but I can hear you well, that's enough, but if you have your hand on the microphone or something, just to tell you a little bit \r\n\r\n00:05:03 SPK_2 \r\n. Sorry. It's better now \r\n\r\n00:05:04 SPK_1 \r\n. Yeah, the sound is good, good sound, but sometimes it gets low and then goes back to being high \r\n\r\n00:05:11 SPK_2 \r\n. A little bit of internet quality, I apologize \r\n\r\n00:05:13 SPK_1 \r\nGood, God willing, good. God willing, good, great, so you are currently in the study phase, or are you, I mean, in any other field, I mean, not the field of training, green construction, you, I mean, what is your job, have you done training? Or do you mostly work as an architect or engineer? \r\n\r\n00:05:34 SPK_2 \r\nHonestly, I mean, I worked before, we received training from the United Nations mission \r\n\r\n00:05:41 SPK_3 \r\n. In the leaders \r\n\r\n00:05:41 SPK_2 \r\nyouth, oh at that time also on climate change, oh? We also conducted training for youth in sustainable development, and we worked on it. Currently, it is under development, and I also provide training for teams. I am also a team leader for the youth of the United Nations mission in four Iraqi governorates. \r\n\r\n00:06:06 SPK_1 \r\nGood, good. Yeah, for you, if you were to say that in all the green home sections and green building, where are you most receptive to, the strongest thing in green building, or in the model and design. \r\n\r\n00:06:32 SPK_2 \r\n. Yeah, honestly, I see my strengths as being in the architectural drawing itself, and putting the green dots, as we say, in the right place. This is what I feel I am most skilled at, honestly. \r\n\r\n00:06:44 SPK_1 \r\nHahaha. Yeah, where and how do you know the right place for the green dots? How do you think about them as an architect? \r\n\r\n00:06:53 SPK_2 \r\nHonestly, as a design, as soon as we receive it, we see the people who will use this design, what their needs are for this place, how they use it from the people present, their ages, their sizes, we honestly study all these details, then we start to lay the foundation stone for our most important design, and then we see their needs, of course, regardless of how aesthetic the design is, it must be service-oriented \r\n\r\n00:07:19 SPK_1 \r\n. Yes, yes \r\n\r\n00:07:20 SPK_2 \r\n. So with this, we integrate green spaces in a more adaptable way to reduce the percentage of electricity use, and in addition, it attracts solar energy systems. Currently, we suggest this in all our designs. Solar energy is also very saving, and thank God, the sun in Iraq is very beautiful, so we can \r\n\r\n00:07:41 SPK_3 \r\nWhat does that mean? \r\n\r\n00:07:44 SPK_1 \r\nWhat? So, I mean, if I see that when the idea of green houses comes to pass, I mean, you impose it on people, you say that this will solve your problems, right? Hello? \r\n\r\n00:08:03 SPK_2 \r\n. You're welcome. You're welcome, Mr. Bilal. \r\n\r\n00:08:05 SPK_1, \r\nbut what should I say, to whom? I mean, to what extent do you impose green building on people, if the green idea just says that this will solve your problems, this way? \r\n\r\n00:08:18 SPK_2 \r\n. As a hypothesis, of course we're not proud, but people are all looking for their own comfort, so let's tell them about \r\n\r\n00:08:28 SPK_3 \r\n. The way to do this will be through \r\n\r\n00:08:31 SPK_2 \r\n. Using solar panels in the future will be better for you through the availability of green spaces in the home. It will be a great honor for you, people will like this idea \r\n\r\n00:08:39 SPK_1 \r\nWhat do you think people would like, like the courtyard, the green space inside the house, or the solar panels or what? I mean, do you think people would like to do it in buildings regarding green things in Iraq? Things we can do, but I want to see, I mean, the process and how people would receive it? What is there? \r\n\r\n00:09:06 SPK_2 \r\nThe sound was cut off. I apologize for your question. What do you accept people from? \r\n\r\n00:09:12 SPK_1 \r\nI mean, yes, there are many things we can do in the house to make it more sustainable, and to be news, but something to welcome the Iraqi people in Mosul \r\n\r\n00:09:26 SPK_2 \r\n. Yes, let me tell you my point of view frankly. Nowadays, people know the spaces for houses. It's not the same as before. It might be 800 to 700 square meters. Now, the majority are 150 to 200 square meters. Wow, people tell you, either he has a small garden outside, or there is another idea. Yes, at night inside the house, we make skylights so that natural light enters the house and parts of the rooms. So, the most important thing is that we present to them the idea of making an internal garden. This internal garden is a green space, and at the same time it is a skylight for natural light to enter. People like the idea of utilizing space, killing two birds with one stone, as we say. This thing is very nice. As for the topic of solar energy, it is a new idea, yes, but it is also desirable, but it needs, I mean, from our point of view, frankly, it needs a bit of time, so that people get used to it \r\n\r\n. 00:10:18 SPK_1 \r\nSo, what is the problem? Is the lighting and cooling solved for them at the same time? \r\n\r\n00:10:26 SPK_2 \r\nLighting, it's food, natural sound, and green space available in the middle of the house, not just outside the house, so that it stays clean, like we say, part of the inside of the house, and they're an outlet for the family, they like to sit and have a small sitting area, is that really good? \r\n\r\n00:10:42 SPK_1 \r\n. Nice, huh? What color would that be? I mean, if they only have 150 square feet, where do we go? Hahaha, a garden inside the house \r\n\r\n00:10:50 SPK_2 \r\nThis is also where the architect starts, hahahaha, to make this place central, or to utilize the most possible part, which can reach three rooms, or for example, a kitchen and two rooms, or even a living room, yes, it must have naturalness and greenery, and even its view, of course, something completely natural \r\n\r\n00:11:10 SPK_1 \r\n. Sweet, yes, you, you, what do you see? You have pictures, I mean, if you have any pictures of a house that you made, I would be very happy to see them. \r\n\r\n00:11:20 SPK_2 \r\n. I will definitely save them. And you too, God willing, after listening. \r\n\r\n00:11:23 SPK_1 \r\nSweet, you are working on a project that has these things, I mean, a green space, if one, I mean, it's not for architects, but there is anything, I mean, you made a model of a design for it, I mean, it's part of sustainability. \r\n\r\n00:11:41 SPK_2 \r\n. Honestly, this is like this idea of an internal garden, we are doing, and even within the garden, I mean, the researcher wanted to work on a waterfall. There is a family that wanted a waterfall inside the garden. What? Because it's very sweet, honestly. \r\n\r\n00:11:56 SPK_1 \r\n. Sweet. Sweet, do you think that most of the people who work as architects and engineers of houses in Mosul have this information about cooling, how to bring lighting, how to bring cooling, how to use green space, or water like this waterfall, or if these ideas, I mean, few people know them. \r\n\r\n00:12:25 SPK_2 \r\nProfessor Bilal, if you allow me here, I will give you two theoretical points of view, one point of view, what is it? The first is from the perspective of the citizen himself, there is a citizen who comes and tells you that he wants the design like this even if it is wrong for him to want it like this, and he is closed off, I mean. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:12:41 SPK_3 \r\n. Yes, yes. Just like \r\n\r\n00:12:42 SPK_1 \r\n. He found a map online, downloaded it, and it came to you. \r\n\r\n00:12:47 SPK_2 \r\n. Yes, hahaha, exactly. Let him tell you that I want someone like him. What did he see? Maybe he has relatives and someone like him. Even if it was wrong, even of course, after the designs there is more electricity consumption, for example, if the facade is glass, more sunlight comes in, if it is black, more sun comes in, yes, so the cooling draws more energy, so it consumes more, yes. This is a negative point. The second theory is the architect, of course, if the architect has the idea, this is sustainable, yes, he will not even accept to come and apply and stick, he will advise, he will give advice, this will be better, I mean, or as much as possible than him wasting his effort until he develops \r\n\r\n00:13:31 SPK_1 \r\nSorry, what did you say at the end? The performance? I don't know why the line, I mean it's not the connection, it's the low sound, and then the technical side, I don't know why? What are you saying? \r\n\r\n00:13:43 SPK_2 \r\nDo you want me to leave the meeting and come back in? \r\n\r\n00:13:46 SPK_1 \r\nOh, if you come, if you expect, oh, the handwriting will improve, oh, it will be better, because sometimes I can't hear everything, all the words \r\n\r\n00:13:53 SPK_2 \r\n. Let's try your license, I'll close it and come back in \r\n\r\n00:14:17 SPK_1 \r\n. Ok, can I train? Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Hello. Hello. Ok, okay, I can hear you again. Hello \r\n\r\n00:15:27 SPK_3 \r\n. The sound is back \r\n\r\n00:15:28 SPK_1 \r\n. Yes, the sound is back \r\n\r\n00:15:30 SPK_2 \r\n. Excellent. Thank God \r\n\r\n00:15:31 SPK_1 \r\n. Ok, good, God willing, good, so you were saying that he is the engineer who will give advice, and then a little bit the sound got messed up \r\n\r\n00:15:39 SPK_2 \r\n. Yes, of course, here the engineer who has this modern idea, let's say when a person wants to design, you know, the majority of people design, they want advice, they want an expert, they want someone who has a better idea, so here they will give him advice. That he uses more green spaces in the design, the design, he says, no, this is wrong, he advises him about some designs, they mean they consume electricity, etc., so here comes the role of the successful architect \r\n\r\n00:16:16 SPK_1 \r\nGood? Good, but engineers in general have this ability and they have the information, if this is something they need, \r\n\r\n00:16:26 SPK_2 \r\nI mean they definitely have it, but not all of them \r\n\r\n00:16:31 SPK_1 \r\nI mean, if. If you give a percentage, what would you say? What kind of problems? \r\n\r\n00:16:37 SPK_2 \r\nMy theory is that? I mean? I think, frankly, 20% of engineers give this thing. \r\n\r\n00:16:45 SPK_1 \r\nGood, but do you think that when they give these pieces of advice, will it benefit them in their work? So, what are we trying to do with the project? We want to try to create new job opportunities and open new job opportunities, and at the same time, work on building green houses. And if someone starts thinking about green building, how do you think it will benefit them? Will they find work and find a job, or any of those things? \r\n\r\n00:17:20 SPK_2 \r\nGood, Mr. Bilal, honestly, I live in more than one city in Iraq, in Baghdad and Kirkuk, and I went to Basra and lived in Erbil for a long time. I didn't know if you were from Mosul or abroad or from inside Iraq. I honestly don't know exactly. \r\n\r\n00:17:36 SPK_1 \r\nYes, I currently live outside Iraq. Tell me a little about me. My parents are Iraqi, but they went to study and never came back. Hahaha. I was born in America. Now I live in France and work in Iraq and come back. But when I was young, my parents insisted that we return to the country one day. Hahaha. I always think my Arabic is a little weak, but they insisted that we speak Arabic at home. So, I have this guy who worked in Iraq and did his service there and met. And guys like you, it's a disaster. So thank God. But why not in Iraq? I ask a lot of questions because in order for us to do good training, and in order for us to find good trainers who can benefit people, it has to be realistic, it has to be something, meaning it has people sharing it, and I need information and ideas from you, anything you can share with me will help me a lot, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:18:40 SPK_2 \r\nExactly, Professor Bilal, this is the point I want to get across, frankly, that during my experience living in more than one city, I wanted to give you an experience or the idea that the people of Mosul have, regarding engineering designs, construction, and even purchasing and marketing, the people of Mosul are different, you know this is different, a city is a city, not a country, a country, yes, for the people of Mosul, the most important thing for them is trust, if they are a person they trust, this thing will always make them design it and advise their friends and relatives, so when someone succeeds with a certain idea through sustainable development, solar energy, and so on, from these modern ideas. Zain Al-Reedy, the one who designs for them, yes, they will gain his trust. Will he gain their trust, right? \r\n\r\n00:19:35 SPK_3 \r\n. They seem to be advertising it \r\n\r\n00:19:38 SPK_2 \r\n. So this is different, I mean, if someone doesn’t have experience, like a certain engineer, and his reputation is good, yes, the people of Mosul don’t design, hahaha. So, honestly, this \r\n\r\n00:19:46 SPK_1 \r\n. How do we break it? Do we have to? How do we work? And guys, a lot of the people who will come for training, God willing, will be graduates, but one of the goals of the project is for them to work. And guys, the guys don’t have a hobby, it’s hard for them to be new, they fail. Do you think someone will be able to start? And breaks, breaches this topic, and builds trust \r\n\r\n00:20:09 SPK_3 \r\nAs a simple suggestion from me, we can integrate these young people with existing engineering companies, Reddy at the post and working at the same time, they will gain experience, and with that they will gain reputation and trust, how if a new young man, a recent graduate, says I worked with such and such company, such and such company is well-known in Mosul and their work is good, the work with them, for example, it took him two years to gain experience and he has trust, and at the same time he is working at the same level, with this company, yes if it is not this company, then definitely not, it will be a successful company, that's it, \r\n\r\n00:20:46 SPK_1 \r\nI mean they are trusted in Mosul, how many names do you have? \r\n\r\n00:20:51 SPK_3 \r\n. Honestly, I can't suggest names for you right now \r\n\r\n00:20:56 SPK_1 \r\n. Okay, because I was thinking, is there a possibility that we could find interships with them? I mean, when they pass the course, when they finish, they have an opportunity to go and work with these companies. We just start looking, we try to be this, but expect these companies that are not reliable, our concern is this idea of sustainability. If they don't have this idea of sustainability \r\n\r\n00:21:22 SPK_3 \r\n. This is your first step. If you want to do this idea, of course, this is the idea that I. I personally found it, but not in this field. I found it in the media. I spent six months training with the organization and so on. I mean, my salary was paid by a non-organization so that I could gain experience. But of course, after this training, thank God I found a job in the same organization that they answered \r\n\r\n00:21:47 SPK_1 \r\n. Sweet, yeah \r\n\r\n00:21:48 SPK_3 \r\nIf we want to introduce this idea to young graduates, and at the same time to engineering companies, we have to do the training for both, first for the engineering company. We tell them to fully understand the idea and then for the young people. Young people, we mean we'll do training for you with the company. It might be paid, young people. Of course they'll love it, especially the graduates will love this idea. Yes, they'll gain experience at the same time. It's an opportunity, an opportunity, for those who spend a long time with the company to gain experience through training. Why? Because now in the job market in Mosul or in Iraq in general, or when you go to apply, the interviewer tells you I need two to nine years of experience. So where will the graduate get it from? Two years or three years? \r\n\r\n00:22:35 SPK_1 \r\n. From zero to three? Now you graduate, it takes three years, I mean. Hahaha. So that never happens \r\n\r\n00:22:40 SPK_3 \r\n. Okay, will you hire me so that I can have this experience? He says, “No, I want experience with you. Go train with someone else, and then come here.” Honestly, universities do not provide this. Now, you know abroad that there are universities that provide training within the years of study, so when he graduates, he has work experience and does not go out and be shocked. Currently, the Iraqi youth among us go out and are shocked to see, I mean. Work is different from studying at university \r\n\r\n00:23:10 SPK_1 \r\nWhat I've heard is that one of the problems is that they teach theoretical subjects, but there's no practical ones. So one of the things I'm trying to think about is how we can add something practical to the training, about green building design, because it means what will the drawing be like? Do you have any suggestions? How can we transform the training from something theoretical to something more practical? \r\n\r\n00:23:37 SPK_3 \r\nProfessor Bilal, honestly, I don't know what your specialization is, what your studies are or anything, but as for engineering, if it's not an engineer, he'll send me the site - what we call it - it's impossible for him to do it. Doesn't that happen abroad? Yes, even if he was an architect, even if he was an interior designer, he has to see you. He has to have visual feedback. He has to know how this is built. These spaces, where do these spaces go? What does this mean? Yes, with that agent, even if he was a real designer, he would come back to the office with an imaginative vision that I designed this, this, it would be so bad if I did this from him, it would be so. It's not like just my theory, my theory, my theory is high, I mean for nothing, when he comes to implement it, I mean. What's the shock? \r\n\r\n00:24:28 SPK_1 \r\nWe have training, but our time is short, and guys, we have five days, six days, so maybe, we have to go visit, I mean houses that are being built, I don't know how, what do you think? How can we install something? I mean, money, I mean, someone sees and feels, I mean, the meaning of things and training \r\n\r\n00:24:52 SPK_3 \r\nI mean, honestly, five days \r\n\r\n00:24:53 SPK_2 \r\n. I don't think that's enough time for this \r\n\r\n00:24:57 SPK_3 \r\n. What we want to get across, however, is that we can conduct field visits to the sites that are currently being built and have the points that we need in terms of development, safety, and solar energy. This is so that they have enough experience and keep in mind that when I visited such-and-such site, they were working on sustainable development. So that when he designs in the future, he should keep in mind that I am designing. This benefits society and benefits the individual. Yes, \r\n\r\n00:25:23 SPK_1 \r\n. Yes, F.F.B. We need to cooperate with people who work in construction so that they can maintain it. Let's talk about the sites. This is something we need to think about. \r\n\r\n00:25:36 SPK_3 \r\n. Of course, of course, \r\n\r\n00:25:38 SPK_1 \r\n. Yes, and one of the things that I liked about Mosul, and one of the things that is frustrating about Mosul is the old houses, they were destroyed, really, and one of the things that I thought about when I started thinking about what is a green building? I said two years ago there was no electricity, no oil, no generator, or anything. So it has to be a sustainable house, because it doesn’t have the capacity to be consumed. Yes, the oil and electricity in the traditional house, it’s the sustainable house, so what does that mean? Yes, you see in Mosul, I mean, it’s not that we build like they used to build, but what are the things that we can learn from the historical houses even? Can we incorporate them into the modern design, really, new houses? I mean. I mean, they teach this in colleges \r\n\r\n00:26:42 SPK_3 \r\n. Oh, great, Professor Bilal. As for the construction, if we go back to our heritage and antiquities to the Ashura or Babylonian periods, we see that their construction was very smart. Even if you notice the air paths, the air enters the house in a very smart way and the air enters widely, and you can, you know, inside the house and feel the coolness now. This thing is different, I’ll tell you, regarding the atmosphere and climate. No, I’ll tell you regarding the design itself. Yes, there are designs that even two people enter the place, you feel suffocated, you enter the place and say, “No, God willing, and its breath is wide, and I’m comfortable with it.” Yes, right? So, it depends on the air that enters the air paths, and even the natural lighting. You see this yourself. If we go back to the period that you mentioned, two or 300 years ago, the houses were oriental, like what is found in the old area of Mosul. The garage was open in the middle, and the whole house had nice natural light, and you see in the middle of the… In the middle of the house, there's a fountain, there's water, there's greenery, they care about plants, frankly, this is what \r\n\r\n00:27:54 SPK_1 \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n00:27:54 SPK_3 \r\n. I mean. Already. They use sustainable designs. We, yes, aren't entirely educated by them. And this is taught in universities through what? Through the history of architecture. The curriculum is called the history of architecture. It tells you that the buildings were like this, but it doesn't tell you that the air paths were smart. Yes, I must demand that this idea be expanded and that they go and search for external sources. So this thing will happen \r\n\r\n00:28:22 SPK_1 \r\n. So. So, this idea, how can we learn from history and build something? It doesn't have to look the same, but the... the way... we don't know how to say it in Arabic. You know the word in Spanish \r\n\r\n00:28:37 SPK_3 \r\n. Method \r\n\r\n00:28:38 SPK_1 \r\nIts method. I mean, learn from the methods and apply them using new things. Do you mean, do you see anything like this in Mosul? Are there architects now? Or do they think about the air and think? I mean, how can they get the air into the house? I mean, in what direction and where is the sun coming from? And small windows? Or big ones? I mean, all of these issues, I mean. It was part of the science of architects. But I don't know why? Some of them forgot. Make big windows. And the air conditioning is on? \r\n\r\n00:29:15 SPK_3 \r\n. Yes, exactly. Honestly, Professor Bilal, I mean, there isn't, there isn't, but as we say, the workers can be counted on the fingers. I mean, a smart architect has to calculate a lot of calculations, yes, to show that the air, the water, the air quality. So that this gets in, what does he get out of it? Not just the entry, of course, the air doesn't get in and gets squished, or certainly who gets out? And I mean, these are things that must be studied. Currently, not everyone is like this, honestly. I mean, few \r\n\r\n00:29:45 SPK_1 \r\nBut where did they even study? I mean, do they think like this, or do they teach themselves what color? Where is their atmosphere? \r\n\r\n00:29:52 SPK_3 \r\nPersonal efforts, how did they develop themselves? I mean, like the saying goes, whoever does not progress becomes outdated. In the mall, everyone is progressing and developing at this stage. Someone finished their studies and started working and the modern designs came, which are the majority, especially commercial ones. For me, you develop yourself. You read external sources, you see the history of the building, what color it was, so this definitely built an architectural thought that I see as successful but at the same time useful. \r\n\r\n00:30:27 SPK_1 \r\nYes. And it means reducing the cost for the people who live in the house, I mean, in the end, he doesn't tell them that this is it because it's history and I don't know what else is nice, no, I mean, in the end, it's cheaper and better and nicer for someone to live in it \r\n\r\n00:30:43 SPK_3 \r\n. Exactly, no, not all people are engineers, for him, we don't have to tell them \r\n\r\n00:30:48 SPK_1 \r\nYeah, yeah, right? Right? Yeah, you're one of those people who developed himself hahahaha in this direction and the education of heritage, and the connection to sustainability and all of this \r\n\r\n00:31:04 SPK_3 \r\nHonestly, I mean, I'm not a professional at all, but I always get tired of being, I mean, I always ask to learn something new, so I love, I mean, this idea of curiosity that you want to learn something new, and I always ask this thing frankly \r\n\r\n00:31:20 SPK_1 \r\n. Okay? Because I want to see a way to train ours, I want to focus on it a little bit, I expect this means linking the cost and giving people a way to distinguish themselves in the market, I mean when they go to people and tell them that this house will be cheaper by this percentage, because yes, I mean, not because we will install solar panels and that’s it, no, because it is a smart building and a building that, at the same time, is built on our heritage, our heritage, our concern, so they are proud of it in the field, but not just proud of it being cheaper and better, and its life, the best people, do you think that if we can try to make this training last, it will develop the skills and capabilities, for architects to think like this and know these techniques, it will be something very nice and current for me, I mean, I don’t know if you know Dr. Basem from Mosul, I mean from Mosul College, and he has hobby research on the subject, but how can we do this subject? So, it's a training thing, meaning we can teach architects not just something theoretical, but something, I mean information, I mean I want it to be applied, so the idea is that training has the potential to allow creativity, for these people, the design language, or the new modern design of Mosul, which is educated and developed from history, a concept that we don't mean after it was made, so we will need to design it, we people need to design it, the architects and engineers, yes, this must be allowed, it will happen, the Okum, meaning the result of the project is that we come and do this research, and we object, meaning we show people the things that were and we say what is this, but it is new, let's work on the design, we all work and make drawings, each one chooses the history and finds a way to update it and put in a 150 square foot house and make its place in the middle of Mosul here, and this means and. And he designs for her, and in the five days, we see who comes up with the best project. I don't know if this is a good idea, or not a good idea, but this is one of the ideas for, training \r\n\r\n00:33:58 SPK_3 \r\n. Of course, Professor Bilal, Iraqi youth in general have tremendous, tremendous, beautiful energies, so we can, yes, exploit this energies because most of them are dormant or stagnant, not discovered yet. We can renew this energies, discover it, and develop it, the youth through training and collaborative work. At the same time, the challenges, these trainings that we are talking about, if they are five days or more, whether they are on the designs themselves, whether they are on architectural culture or construction culture, let's say this, will really develop the youth. It will give them a strong push, it will give them passion, it will give them an idea for the design they are working on. Yes, through this training, how can we, as I told you, discover the skills of young people more and more? Yes, we can prepare them for design, and at the same time, we can connect it, which is the subject of training, to successful companies. As for Dr. Bazin, I know that we are currently working on a heritage digitization project. I am currently working at Al Noor University, and we digitized it, thank God. \r\n\r\n00:35:11 SPK_1 \r\nOh, great. So, do you know what you are working on? What project are you working on? What are you doing together? \r\n\r\n00:35:16 SPK_3 \r\nDigitizing heritage? \r\n\r\n00:35:18 SPK_1 \r\nWhat do they understand? Can you explain it to me, brother? \r\n\r\n00:35:21 SPK_3 \r\n. The heritage digitization project, we take an archaeological site and film it with a 360-degree mobile camera. And then this archaeological site, you know, with time, with time, it might destroy it a little bit. And it happens to me, I mean, there are sites, frankly, for example, what happened during the time of ISIS, for example, there are many archaeological sites that were destroyed. Now, if we go see them or search for them, we can find simple pictures on the Internet. So, what can we do? We want to make a virtual tour of each archaeological site. Using VR glasses, the person can move around and see it clearly, and in 360 degrees, as if it were real in front of him. Yes, great. \r\n\r\n00:36:08 SPK_1 \r\n. Using \r\n\r\n00:36:09 SPK_3 \r\n, is this our program called the Aqmounat Al-Turath program? \r\n\r\n00:36:13 SPK_1 . \r\nYes, great. So, are you going to cooperate with QAF? If this is something that you are going to do? \r\n\r\n00:36:20 SPK_3 \r\n. No, no, it's the same project, and it cooperates and closes \r\n\r\n00:36:24 SPK_1 \r\nfor Kaf and I see some of these very nice fountains, yes, a nice idea, and one of the things that are recruited, think that when we do these things, we can do, I mean, the heritage things, I mean, from the heritage that it has, the idea of sustainability, see, I mean, the wind tower, someone goes and sees the fountain and the old one, but it's all about the if on the, the idea of sustainability is from the heritage, so think about it, hahaha, explore. But if he explores for a reason and we can use it for the architects, and use it in training. Yes, we tell them, come on, let's see all these things, so explain to us why? This? I mean, the girl comes from the point of view of, yes, sustainability and comfort and, yes, yes, so there will be something nice, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:37:27 SPK_3 \r\nProfessor Zillal, in addition to this, we are not talking about theoretical training, we want to make it a little practical. I feel this is a little out of the ordinary for you to say that this site is 300 years old, or you can see it while you are sitting in its place and take a look at its design. It is nice, by the way, hahaha. \r\n\r\n00:37:45 SPK_1 \r\nYes, yes, you expect, I mean, I do not know what it might take until someone makes a new drawing. I mean, I am not an architect, I mean, computer engineering schools, and then studied? Programming, robotics, and then did a master’s degree in what is it called, or education and science. I mean, how does one do the training? So, I don't know anything about how long it will take, since I don't have any imagination. I mean, maybe the first part of the training will be about information about all the parts of the green house. How can it work, houses? I mean, if we have pictures of houses, for example, if you send me a picture of this garden inside the house, I mean, the houses of Mosul that have these things from the garden, yes, if there are any, I mean, panels or what does the wind get into the house that is designed in a way, I mean, the decoration of its windows, and its orientation, okay, I mean, we water them and do this, I mean, so that there are people who see it and talk and participate, but then after we do all of this, I want to talk about the heritage and the things of sustainability, I mean, the information that is the methods they used to make the house comfortable, and it has the idea of sustainability. And then we have to update it. So the first text means that we learn things from the reality in Mosul, the houses that they implement, and from the history of Mosul, which was covered, I mean, in the houses, ah, by the ah, by the ah, the historical Mosul, and then the second text, how do we update it? Let's do it, I mean? And draw together, but I don't know if we have three days is enough for us to do research and think about seeing a teacher, or if someone goes to his house, if he says that if he has a house and one of his cousins wants to build a new house, how do we advise him and make him do this, like advice and a packet and he tries to sell it, he says this house, I did this and this, and this we learned from the heritage of this and this and this and this and applied it to this house at the cost. I don't know how much $1,000 is for this area of 150 square feet, and it was built here. And this is the cost because we used this. The sustainability values, it will be, I mean, it will save this much oil per year, and this much, what is it called, not from the generator, I don't know, I mean, this is part, I don't know, what do you think of the idea of the training, I mean half and half, or if it's short, three days \r\n\r\n00:40:47 SPK_3 \r\n. In terms of what? It might need, in terms of digitizing a specific heritage site, this depends on the place itself, if it's in more detail, it will take more time, if it's inside and outside, it will take more and more time, yes, until now, we have completed a project for Al Noor University itself, so it took us about two weeks to 20 days. We even completed the entire university, knowing that there were some challenges, we might not find them in other archaeological sites, yes, I mean, Al Noor University, it's not an introductory site, I mean, heritage or historical, but we have started with it, yes, for me, Professor Bilal, the training days, in my opinion, frankly, are few. This needs more, it needs more time, we mean. So, with all this amount of information in three days, will the person become a little bit overwhelmed? So what's the point of all these three days? Well, let me apply for a while, let me explore for a while, let me see for a while if it's right or not? I mean, this is what I want to talk about. From a trainee's point of view, I mean, we benefited from the \r\n\r\n00:42:01 SPK_1 training \r\n. Honestly, I know, it's a short time and people get tired \r\n\r\n00:42:05 SPK_3 \r\nexactly, even sometimes it gets a little bit overwhelming. I mean, you psychologically have to complete all of this in one day, so the subject deserves more. The subject is very beautiful and the training is very nice, so why don't I give it a little bit more time? \r\n\r\n00:42:18 \r\nSPK_1 So, you mean, if you mean, think with me for how many days? And what are the topics? What? What days? We're saying, the first day will be about the sun. The second day, about the winds and the zodiac signs and the windows and so on. And the third day, I mean, how do you put the TSH, I mean, connect the training, if you have the days you want? \r\n\r\n00:42:49 SPK_3 \r\nYes, if I have the days I want, then basically, yes, our target group is graduate students \r\n\r\n00:42:56 SPK_1 \r\n. I mean, they have knowledge, I mean, architects and engineers. This is what we don't have to work on and I don't know what else. And they have. All the capabilities \r\n\r\n00:43:07 SPK_3 \r\nOkay, are they taking my theory enough? Isn't that right? \r\n\r\n00:43:13 SPK_1 \r\nMy theory. Enough with it, I mean, but without the idea of sustainability or heritage or anything, I mean, there is a possibility that this will come, but architects from the college, you know, how do they come out? \r\n\r\n00:43:27 SPK_3 \r\n. Their need, their need will be, first of all, looking at the location they are in, like the city of Mosul, like the country of Iraq, so they know what helps the job market. And then, yes, it is possible to quickly think on the first day or the first part of the history of architecture. With the mastery of architecture, the basics of construction, the methods used in construction, the construction style, and then they will go to the job market itself, meaning we can identify several locations and transport them at the same time. We can exploit something while we are going to these locations. We can \r\n\r\n00:44:04 SPK_1 \r\n. We go to the job market, what is it that pushes them, meaning we go to a building that is being built \r\n\r\n00:44:08 SPK_3 \r\n. What is the side? A while ago, we could agree with people, yes, in construction companies. So, this is the purpose, that after we agree with them, of course, we will take the trainees to this place and we can exploit something that I want to get across, that this place has several errors that they noticed on the second day. After that, there will be training, meaning to correct these ideas and distortions, and they will have it. Training on modern sustainable construction, in which we can utilize the air, water, and natural light, and then we take them to other locations. Yes, an ancient one, we tell them this is what it was, and the air entered correctly, lighting from all sides, and then the designs, the final thing they will see, must be modern and built with the things that are present in the correct heritage things. This is my point of view, that is \r\n\r\n00:45:12 SPK_1 \r\nYes, yes. No, no, I liked that he means someone goes and sees and we don't tell them yes, this house has these negative things and these things, the decorations, I mean we go and let them feel it, and then after a while my theory is that they will have this. I mean, our way of thinking, and then they share the house. I liked that it has Hetchi, Hetchi, Hetchi. This house, the heritage is like this. So, it’s nice that every day, maybe, or at the beginning of the day, yes, we go for a walk, we go out and see and explore and take information at the end of the day, yes, we talk about it and he insists on us a little bit, more, yes, I mean, yes, thinking about what we saw. And we learn from each other. And then, maybe we come to what we call the end of the project, what do we take from these things that we learned? Even if each one chooses for himself a criterium of this size here in this place, and they try to use things from what we learned from heritage, and from the negative hadith and decorations, so that we can start with a house, or if we draw, we can make a drawing of a house with more, the benefits, and at the same time, it must have the material, how will this make construction cheaper, and reduce the annual consumption of construction and increase the comfort of the people inside, and like I said at the beginning, they must know the site and people, how many people have children, yes, they cook at home as a hobby, I mean, all these things that I talked about at the beginning \r\n\r\n00:47:00 SPK_3 \r\n. Honestly, Professor Bilal, I came to a period in my life, I mean, I wanted to train in graphic design, so I worked in this field, so the most important thing before we design, what should we have as visual input? We will go see what these colors are, what are these materials? What is this? Where do you use it? This color? Like this, what does this color mean that it is comfortable for the eye, this color like this? These are very details. It makes a difference here as graduates and also as engineers before they design, they must have this visual feedback, the visual feedback that I mentioned to you a while ago, with these steps that we take them to homes, and then there was nothing else, here it will be correct visual feedback, because this is the place, but it must be better by using these modern methods in development. Yes, they will have successful visual feedback. They come to design, they know what to do, and in a way that benefits people, as you mentioned a while ago that it is a service and not just aesthetics. \r\n\r\n00:48:09 SPK_1 \r\nVery, very nice. This is what I liked the idea that I started to have fun, I mean I want to be part of the team. Now I will go out and see and make notes. \r\n\r\n00:48:21 SPK_3 \r\n. Is this a passion that makes you have passion and enthusiasm, you go out and do all these things, so that it later gives you a passion for a beautiful start \r\n\r\n00:48:31 SPK_1 \r\n. Yeah yeah God willing \r\n\r\n00:48:34 SPK_3 \r\nHonestly, you're welcome Mr. Bilal, especially if the projects are huge costs are one of the basic things that the engineer has to calculate, I mean an engineer might come and do a project for $50,000, if another engineer comes and does it for the same amount of time for $47,000, here the project owner will definitely take the lower cost. So, does the engineer have to have knowledge of the materials? How does he choose the right material in the right place in the most appropriate way? \r\n\r\n00:49:09 SPK_1 \r\nEeh Eeh? \r\n\r\n00:49:11 SPK_3 \r\n. What's next, I mean, part of the financial or administrative matters? I've been there for two years, and if I told you, sorry, about myself a lot, I might have made you taste it. \r\n\r\n00:49:20 SPK_1 \r\n. No, no, no, this. This is very important, but how will he be able to know the cost of the materials and everything, all these things? \r\n\r\n00:49:31 SPK_3 \r\n. What now? I also studied business administration, from a university in Erbil. What did I try to introduce to the engineering field? There's a subject called quantity surveying. What is this quantity surveying? How does it come about first? You receive the project, which is a piece of land. You calculate the area of the land, the height of the project. He'll take, for example, 2,000 blocks, 24 bags of cement, two tons of gravel. What will he take? A thousand shingles, a thousand iron. Yes, you take everything by calculating the quantities. This means the subject or the study of the calculations. The quantities are important for the engineer to know so that he can see what is the most appropriate thing at the most appropriate cost, so he can complete this project. \r\n\r\n00:50:23 SPK_1 \r\nOkay, so you expect this to need a day, a full day, meaning calculations. If so, how do you expect we can do it? \r\n\r\n00:50:33 SPK_3 \r\n. As for designers or architects, not everyone needs it, perhaps a civil engineer does. So, if the target group of this training is designers and architects, I don't think we will give it importance or take time since we have a specific time, frankly. \r\n\r\n00:50:55 SPK_1 \r\nOkay, so what if we don't have time to go into it, what do we do? \r\n\r\n00:51:01 SPK_3 \r\n. I mean, honestly, there is something important and something more important. You know, we can use the time for things that are more important to me, designers, architects, if it's civil engineers, then quantity surveying, of course. I mean, we want to know who the target group is, and based on that, we want to determine their needs and present them \r\n\r\n. 00:51:21 SPK_1 \r\nOkay, understood. I mean, I mean, the schedule is starting to become clearer for me. It was in the beginning, okay? A study on history, site learning. Why do we need to learn from heritage? I mean, what are the parts? I mean, what about the basement and the wind tower? And what about all these things and how do they work? And then passive design techniques. I mean, how can one take this second day? Then the third day was, I mean, what is the difference between any house made of rock? What does it mean? If a house has insulation, it's good, compared to a house that doesn't have insulation, good? What are the types of insulation in Mosul, is this the traditional insulation? Modern insulation, what's the difference between them? Then the fourth day was for them to make a 150 square foot model house and test it and see the life cycle cost of the house and how much it would save. And then the last day was about how convincing one could be. How could one share the project they had drawn, and how could one convince people to work with them because they could lower the prices, so it could become a business. Project money and presentation and real world application but how they kind of assass how the kind of what I learned from you now, we have to change it a little and turn it around maybe, I mean almost the same things I mean it's not heritage I mean heritage this heritage ventilation and the materials of the industry, so from here maybe we can turn it around so one day we study all of these things in modern houses the negatives and positives, and then we do it the second day, the same thing, the same three yes the same the means the and but we go to the heritage houses and study and study them and then maybe on the third and fourth day we give more time to the ah the ah design for business marriage and for this which I just mentioned that how can one know the cost of the materials everything and everything comprehensively, and arrange it I don't know what do you think about this the the the the design of the days, if you have another suggestion \r\n\r\n00:54:08 SPK_3 \r\n. Honestly, after these modifications and field visits, I see it as a comprehensive training, that is, during the period of days. So, in terms of time, in terms of training, in terms of the targeted action, I think it is something good. \r\n\r\n00:54:24 SPK_1 \r\nAnd God willing, we will have fun, that is, I will be with them and we will go out and do these outings. And then, if someone can, at the same time, try to do a simple model, something from home, that would be nice, so that when we reach the training stage, you don’t have to take this and do it like I am saying now. There is a possibility that you will change it, modify it, or change it over the days, but are you ready to think about being comfortable as one of the trainers? \r\n\r\n00:55:05 SPK_3 \r\n. Honestly, I mean, yes, the program in general and the ideas that we want to present are very nice. At the same time, I like to present what I know, and I also like to gain and participate. I mean, just as I share my experiences, I like to see the experiences of others. Yes, if you see me as a trainer and ready for this, I have no problem, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:55:30 SPK_1 \r\nI mean, if I see that you have a hobby of the experience that we need, and maybe the first thing we can do when I arrive in July, I will take the information. I now want to do the exploration, and I learn from the people who are living in Mosul and know the market and know the materials and know all these things. Yes, in reality, yes, and if I design the yes, but when I arrive, God willing, we can meet to review it and modify it together, and then after that we will discuss the trainers. Yes, this is the plan, God willing, yes. \r\n\r\n00:56:14 SPK_3 \r\nVery good, Mr. Bilal. I am very honored to have you, and I am very happy to meet you, God willing, in the upcoming events. \r\n\r\n00:56:22 SPK_1 \r\nI am very, I am very, very happy. One of the last things I said in the last word and I forgot to ask you about it, but the materials, the materials that are available in Mosul, in terms of insulation, and in terms of, oh, sustainability. Is there anything available? What are the prices? Oh, what are the things? I mean, where can you find them? \r\n\r\n00:56:50 SPK_2 \r\nRegarding Mosul? It used to be a commercial center . \r\n\r\n00:56:54 SPK_3 \r\nAnything that comes to your mind? \r\n\r\n00:56:56 SPK_2 \r\n. You can find it \r\n\r\n00:56:57 SPK_3 \r\nNow the situation is a little different, the closest is Erbil as a commercial center, you can find everything there, I mean Mosul, I mean materials in Mosul, yes they are somewhat limited, but I mean something about something that meets the needs of the citizen, at the same time, if there is a person who wants a design with certain insulating materials, \r\n\r\n00:57:18 SPK_1 \r\n. Yes, I mean \r\n\r\n00:57:19 SPK_3 \r\n. It's no longer a problem for what is available, so we order it from Erbil, and he can bring it within an hour, it will arrive \r\n\r\n00:57:24 SPK_1. \r\nYes, Erbil, Erbil? It's definitely not far \r\n\r\n00:57:28 SPK_3 \r\n. Yes, yes, an hour about to connect. Yes, \r\n\r\n00:57:30 SPK_1 \r\nYes, Erbil is not far. Yes, yes, there are materials. You expect people who do not use them a lot, but if there is something, it is important that we share them with the youth in the training. You will know that they will probably be able to use them. Yes, insulating materials. Yes, we do not expect that people will work in the same way that people used to build with rock and clay. Yes, if there are people who work with rock and clay, I do not know. You tell me. Hahaha. \r\n\r\n00:58:04 SPK_3 \r\n. Honestly, everything is available, Professor Bilal, according to the. Hahaha. Yes, by God, there are, I mean, hahaha. Yes, yes, as for me, insulating materials, there are many materials that are used, modern insulating materials, even B. Everything I use is cork as a sound insulator. Yes, in furniture on roofs. Materials that reflect the sun reduce the percentage of entry. Cars, hot air, and the sun’s rays. We use these on roofs. These are all insulating materials that are called and are present in Mosul, I mean \r\n\r\n00:58:41 SPK_1 \r\nReally good. Okay now. Oh, the baby is back. Hahaha. Oh, my wife has arrived now. I have to go back and be with them, God willing. Oh, but she wants you to know that I really want to try to learn what I can from Mohammed and the engineers in your lab. Oh, anyone you think is worth talking to about this topic so I can improve my training. You teach me about them. I mean, who are you encouraging me to talk to? I'm trying to learn from them as well? \r\n\r\n00:59:14 SPK_3 \r\nHonestly, one time we had a workshop in Mosul Space, and Professor Abdullah was present. I was on the research and development committee, so I wanted to record everything. There was a really great risk ratio, including a doctor in the College of Architecture at the University of Mosul, but I honestly don't remember his name, but he's a very knowledgeable person. Good value and I'm sure it will help you, yeah yeah, so can we ask Abdullah about him? \r\n\r\n00:59:44 SPK_1 \r\nAnd he's a second engineer, do you expect him to work like you, he'll mess around with them or not? \r\n\r\n00:59:53 SPK_3 \r\n. Now, I mean, I think this doctor will suggest better names than me. God willing, \r\n\r\n01:00:07 SPK_1 \r\n. God. Thanks for everything. God willing, we'll stop by calling. And I'll tell you when he comes to Mosul, so that, I mean, Roig learned? Improving the design of the training and we'll see if there's a possibility we can agree with each other as trainers within the financial department. \r\n\r\n01:00:33 SPK_3 \r\n. Dear Professor Bilal. Thank you very much for your time. \r\n\r\n01:00:35 SPK_2 \r\n. Editing. \r\n\r\n01:00:35 SPK_3 \r\n. I would like to talk to you and I am honored by your presence \r\n\r\n01:00:40 SPK_1 \r\n. A. Give my regards to Abdullah if you see him and give me your regards about Mosul in general. I hope to see you as a stranger. Peace be upon you."

Is the line working? Can you hear me? Oh, sorry, sorry, I didn't know if it was off. What was the microphone? I thought it was Shant. What was its name? I don't know why the abaya was open. How? What is the peace? \r\n\r\n00:04:31 FATIMA EYAD \r\nAlaikum? \r\n\r\n00:04:38 BILAL \r\n. To Paris, before \r\n\r\n00:04:41 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. This is \r\n\r\n00:04:42 BILAL \r\nHey, this is a picture of Paris. Are you Indjazairah? \r\n\r\n00:04:45 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. No, no, a picture from the internet, I swear \r\n\r\n00:04:48 BILAL \r\n. Now what's its name? It's not in Paris, but in the north of France. Yes, when I saw the pictures I said, oh maybe a visitor, God willing, God willing, God willing, one day you will be in Mosul. Hahaha. Hey, thank God, thank God. Yes, and thank you. Yes, what's the name of the time you took on Friday? First of all, Happy Friday. Yes, and yes, and yes, I'm in the call and God willing, I mean I will benefit a lot from you. I learn about the design and about the situation in Mosul. But what's its name? Just so I can introduce myself a little bit, and then I want to learn a little bit about you. Yes, I am a consultant born in America. My parents left Iraq a long time ago and went to study, but they insisted that we learn Arabic here and we returned to the country the next day. Yes, after that I didn't return. But yes, thank God I found a job in Iraq, and I mean, I'm very proud and happy that I can work in Mosul, visit Mosul, go to Baghdad, and so on. I mean, my hand served in my country, so this is a little bit, I mean why is my Arabic weak? So I have some terms for you to see. On it, I beg your pardon, my English is very good so I can tell you. Good? And the subject, you heard about the subject of the house, if you understand me I can explain a little about it to you \r\n\r\n00:06:18 FATIMA EYAD \r\nDid you hear about the station that I did in Mosul, Seris? \r\n\r\n00:06:22 BILAL \r\n. For the sake of your face, oh, I mean a little more real, actually, but oh yes, thank you. You know the whole subject, oh, but I don’t know about you, if you know the subject, and now we have reached a stage where we are trying to take the training that we did, and to improve it with the information, and the oh, the capabilities and skills of the people in Mosul, oh, and on the ground, oh, and oh, at the same time, we are finding the idea that after a few months he will come to Mosul, oh, now I want to make, I mean, communicate with people in all the factions, or the reconstruction and insulation departments, these recordings that we ended up with, they involved more subjects, but we decided on these three, and in the end, this call is to get to know a little about you, your experience, yes, I suggest the framework of the training, maybe I will show you the idea that we want to do and see if you have ideas about how we can improve it and see if you have any ideas, there is a possibility that you will be One of the trainers with us on the project, so this idea is just to let you know where we are today, and please, if I know that he is where we met, but tell me a little bit more about yourself, God willing . \r\n\r\n00:07:56 FATIMA EYAD \r\nOkay, let me start by saying goodbye. Who would you like to start with? That you are also an architect? \r\n\r\n00:08:05 BILAL \r\nNo, I am an engineer, I mean robotics and programming, and then I studied the science of training and so on. So, what I like to think about is systems, systems. \r\n\r\n00:08:24 FATIMA EYAD \r\nOkay? \r\n\r\n00:08:25 BILAL \r\nAnd one of the things that we live with every day. And it affects us in some way, yes, I mean, sometimes we don’t know the depth of it, it is the buildings and cities, how they are built, and I mean, there are the simplest things sometimes change in the base, or in the streets, or in the way of construction, and society changes, so I love the and you know the goal. So to be clear, where are we trying to get to with this project? Even when we think about training and education, we make sure that we get to them. First of all, work. These are one of the important things, and secondly, at the same level, the ones inside the green building, or the ones inside? These two things must always be on our minds when we think about this project. It is known if this is useful, but now I know how. Yes, if you want to tell me about yourself and your studies. Yes, why did we get to this call? Yes, \r\n\r\n00:09:36 FATIMA EYAD . Yes, \r\nthat means good. \r\n\r\n00:09:38 BILAL \r\n. And let's go back \r\n\r\n00:09:40 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. At the beginning, I wanted to make sure that we are free and normal. I am also good in English, so don't feel that there is pressure. You have to explain to me in Arabic. \r\n\r\n00:09:47 BILAL \r\n. In Arabic, no. No, it's pressure from me because I want to improve my Arabic, but here he loves the language \r\n\r\n00:09:53 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. You're right. It will continue to be crowded, I mean the idea is in your mind in English \r\n\r\n00:09:59 BILAL \r\n. So if there comes a stage where I notice that this is ah um, but immediately after the word for too long the spirit in English, and then I go back, and if I want the term in Arabic, yes I ask you, even I learn, so how does one say this is a turn on the words or? Is there a term? \r\n\r\n00:10:17 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. It is that see what the meaning is in my mind, I want to reach the meaning in my mind, I mean \r\n\r\n00:10:21 BILAL \r\n. Yes, I'm fine, God willing \r\n\r\n00:10:23 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. We were happy from the beginning. I am an architect. I graduated from Mosul University in 2021. I graduated from engineering or architecture, and I graduated from my bachelor's degree. I joined a training course program with ICCROM on heritage areas. In Mosul or the old city of Mosul, its goal was \r\n\r\n00:10:47 BILAL \r\n, meaning Ibram she dullie from? \r\n\r\n00:10:51 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Exactly, the international organization ICOM, headquartered in Italy, okay, in cooperation with UNESCO. The goal of the training course was to qualify the people of the region themselves so that they can develop their city, in terms of knowing what heritage is, how to preserve it, what are the possibilities that can be used to access heritage, heritage. So this forward part, the second part, we are not done with any chrome or training, we can at ICCROM, we created a local organization for the trainees who were, it has the same goals as ICCRON, but only from the local efforts of the trainees who were with them and with them \r\n\r\n00:11:28 BILAL \r\n. Wow \r\n\r\n00:11:29 FATIMA EYAD \r\nWe tried everything, the hobby to get, support, support, to get supplies so that we can start working, to work of course, the whole thing was difficult, difficult, we didn’t get everything, but we got it, yeah, we built the bridges, if you know what a bridge is or have you heard of it? \r\n\r\n00:11:46 BILAL \r\n. No, go ahead \r\n\r\n00:11:49 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Look, just a few seconds, anyway, we made a bridge that is part of one of the most important elements of Mosul's heritage in the old houses in Mosul. It is something like a piece of land that connects to a bank, two houses, or two buildings, yes, you are \r\n\r\n00:12:06 BILAL \r\n. So it's not like the inner, the lower, something they call it \r\n\r\n00:12:11 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Seconds, Iwan, it's me, flipping that was \r\n\r\n00:12:16 BILAL \r\n. Send me on WhatsApp if you can \r\n\r\n00:12:19 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Zenz \r\n\r\n00:12:20 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes, this is the bridge. In English, I don't know, they call it a bridge, way, if \r\n\r\n00:12:28 FATIMA EYAD . \r\nDoes it mean a bridge in Mosul or in Muslawi? \r\n\r\n00:12:32 BILAL \r\n. Sweet, it's gone \r\n\r\n00:12:32 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. I'll take \r\n\r\n00:12:33 BILAL \r\n. Okay, I'll take notes for a moment, yeah, hahaha \r\n\r\n00:12:37 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. So, the first project we did with the IHEV organization, which has the Iraqi Hrich Foundation. Yes, we did it, I mean, the number of bridges that were four due to lack of funding became two. As for the Halabi Bridge and the Obeid Bridge at the end of the newspaper, we tried to apply everything we learned, everything we learned from the ICCROM organization that we took the training course from, and thank God they turned out to be good and are currently working. People have benefited from them \r\n\r\n00:13:10 BILAL \r\n. God willing \r\n\r\n00:13:10 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. God only \r\n\r\n00:13:11 BILAL \r\nafter him, after him, what were they like? I mean, the problem with the bridge is that if it was going to be signed, that is, \r\n\r\n00:13:18 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. The A was in favor of it, that is, it would be spent. It was expected that MM, so we tried to stop it at the same time so that it would be used by people and it would be nice. I mean, it wasn’t just me who brought it back as it was, because you see it as something new and nice, nice. Of course, I was referring to the situation in Iraq. We didn’t get any other support after that. Currently, the projects are stopped, even though we got, let’s say, cooperative certificates from Jordan, from Yemen. We got a cooperation document with ICR itself that we would reach their library if we needed it. But the support here stopped, and there were restrictions on the support. They meant that the amount should not fall completely, so that you rebuild from scratch. There were some restrictions on it. Then events happened that Trump cut the funding and so on, so most of the organizations withdrew the funding. The funding means and so on. And so on, from all the political matters \r\n\r\n00:14:17 BILAL \r\nYes, that's great, but it's really nice, this activity, were you one of the organizers of this new organization? \r\n\r\n00:14:24 FATIMA EYAD \r\nI'm not the one responsible for the organization's public relations? \r\n\r\n00:14:28 BILAL \r\nGod willing. God willing, and God willing, I mean, with all the best. I mean, yes, as another thing, we can delve deeper into this idea, how is this organization, yes, yes, yes, does it receive funding, whether it receives local funding or funding from the locality itself? I mean, there are a lot of things we can think about later, but I want to encourage you to tell me that this is a really wonderful, sweet, and nice idea, yes, just because it came to my mind, and it's one of the questions that I need to answer, or do you do? Training as an organization? Did you work inside the organization to train on the things that you learned? Yes, do you have any experience in training? \r\n\r\n00:15:10 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Frankly, we tried to do training courses for students, whether in architecture, civil engineering, or even construction and building, or even just introductory courses about the old city, not reconstruction, but there was no effort to support this, I mean, if we tried, for example, we went to the University of Mosul College, we tried to do with them, “Do you need approvals?” “Oh, I can’t rent this hall for you to get in?” “Do you have to apply for it to get out?” I mean, there were obstacles, obstacles, crossings? And of course, young people, what do you know? What do you know? Do you know? What are we talking about? Okay, so we’re done? Then I went and worked with UNESCO on the old city, too. Even if we did, for example, reconstruction of the old city, what would we usually do? What are the steps we need to take? Honestly, it was a bit of a project. My point of view, what I have to say about this issue or the negative point is that it came late. I mean, we are already beginning to build several buildings, and then, and then, they asked us to do something for them. This world \r\n\r\n00:16:24 BILAL \r\nis all about it. They call it a post-confession. This is the main problem. People say, “Come on, houses,” “Come on, build without thinking,” and it becomes a bit of a mess. So, how can this be? One tells people to stay in the streets for a while, let’s think about it. It’s very, very difficult. I don’t know how to solve this problem, but they started it well. They did it in the time they could, honestly. Thank God. Oh, there are those who say lenses and there are people who thought about it, and you found out, thank God, you worked on it. The next lines are I mean, the UNESCO focuses more on heritage, but I mean, you even mentioned the alternative buildings and the green building. \r\n\r\n00:17:10 FATIMA EYAD \r\nWhat is it possible for? No, it is not a green building in the full sense of the word. But the work can benefit from the elements present in the old houses to keep pace with the development that is happening now. I mean, you know, we have an open courtyard, and we are great if it is possible to educate it. What is the mechanism? We can use it to find what we can leave for education, right? Here, something comes, what if we introduce the elements, the air conditioning, yes, in a way that can be fixed, how does it not affect the building elements on the facade? In general, the building, but have I informed you that it has not been completely finished yet? Because there is a conflict between the government institutions themselves, this person wants, I mean, this government army wants a certain thing, and this party wants a certain thing, really stopping and that's it. Draft? \r\n\r\n00:18:01 BILAL \r\n. Iraq does not disagree, God willing . \r\n\r\n00:18:04 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. I mean, \r\n\r\n00:18:05 BILAL \r\n, if we can do something together, we can take some of these good ideas and make them practical and apply them. We will find a way to include them in the program, God willing. But let's continue and learn, I mean, what were your dreams and goals? But it doesn't appear much about sustainability. I haven't heard that there is any connection with sustainability within this project? \r\n\r\n00:18:33 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. No, her concern was more that the bad things might make your conditions go back to rebuilding homes, not sustainability being the goal . \r\n\r\n00:18:41 BILAL \r\n. Unfortunately. How nice it looks. Mosul came back, it looks like Mosul, it's important, but the idea is that Mosul looks like Mosul, because it grew in a place and was built in, so that's why it was registered like Mosul, and that's why it was sustainable, that it was built on a long-term sustainable time. In this understanding, people need to know that it's not just about the way it looks, it's not just about putting the air conditioning outside, this is education. Maybe the problem with the courtyard was that it didn't have a roof, it had air in it, I mean. The Instagram generation. Sometimes they forget the depth and take the picture \r\n\r\n00:19:36 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. And honestly, it's not just like that, if you stab a higher step, that the government officials or the government agencies responsible for reconstruction are very ignorant of this issue. I mean, I met with a person, let's say he was the first person directly responsible for this, so his advice to me was, okay. Roof or cover the corridor with a block or something. I mean, it's not necessary that it's for a specific cream material on the mood of the air, the lighting, of course, wait a moment, we're the old Mosul decision on the nomination list that was extended to the World Heritage, what is the most important feature of the houses? Are they curtains that I can remove \r\n\r\n00:20:23 BILAL \r\nand this? \r\n\r\n00:20:27 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. No. No, nothing else, we didn't leave \r\n\r\n00:20:31 BILAL \r\n. Thank God. Thank God \r\n\r\n00:20:34 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. It was a problem. The record is there, not only that as sons of the city, it was not exposed, no, the government agencies responsible for it, as for this sufficient experience \r\n\r\n00:20:46 BILAL \r\nOh, good, good. So now we've reached, oh, is there this institution, or have you started to find work in, oh, the field, oh, you design houses, oh, architecture, oh, what do you do now these days? \r\n\r\n00:21:03 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. What should I do now after I finish this work? UNESCO, frankly, offered a master's degree, and I am in my second year of researching heritage. What should I do for the old city? Help me with heritage ? \r\n\r\n00:21:21 BILAL \r\nWhat's the product? \r\n\r\n00:21:23 FATIMA EYAD \r\nThe heritage didn't work, I mean, it goes to the government agencies. Oh, what did I benefit from this interaction, so that I can manage the heritage more? \r\n\r\n00:21:31 BILAL \r\nThis bridge, it's the bottom of this bridge, half of this bridge is completely collapsed, and this is exactly the most important thing, I mean, we focus on it because it has this story, its heritage, and the price. Its repairs are less. I mean, things like this, right? And what's not? \r\n\r\n00:21:52 FATIMA EYAD \r\nIt exactly depends on each direction? What, for example, if tourism? If culture, if education? \r\n\r\n00:21:59 BILAL \r\n. And yeah. Now you put one of the words in. I mean, let's call it. I mean, what was inside it that was beneficial to people’s livelihood, to the comfort of the people who live there, and what were the goals, I mean, why? Why did they build it like this? Sometimes? People say sustainability, but the idea I might sustainability came about because people were building before electricity and they wanted to be comfortable and to restore things, I mean, what benefits them, they love it and its beauty, and sometimes it’s not just about connecting many things, connecting religion, modesty, beauty, and comfort, and all of it is intertwined. So these things, I mean, I expect it to be beautiful, if you do this from the beginning, I mean, it would be beautiful if you help people see the depth later, understand? It’s not that yes, it’s beautiful, its heritage, let’s preserve it, but why do we preserve it? You have to add these things because it will come, and then we can preserve it, and then maybe we can build on it, and not just building, but covering I don’t know what, a courtyard and starting big. It doesn't mean if we know the methods and reasons, the heritage we will be able to rebuild, and this will reach the way that I mean I want to think about conducting training for architects, I replied I want to see if you know engineers, architects and designers and how they think when they work in buildings now, and how can we, I mean what will the training that we want to conduct benefit them so that they find work like people like you, and so that they find work in the field of just green? I mean, let's say when he says green, think about everything I said, okay between religion and its depth, but the short word \r\n\r\n00:24:01 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. No, but you, maybe I attended with you, first of all the course, the session that you did at home, you honored us, what is the subject of the home? Then there was a competition behind it, yes, for several projects. Among these projects, there was a hobby, these things benefit you or benefit the training you want. There were architects, they came to try how to make new materials. Yes \r\n\r\n00:24:28 BILAL \r\n. And Hemina Azel at the same time, all nice things. Yes \r\n\r\n00:24:33 FATIMA EYAD \r\nAt the same time, there was an engineer I worked with and UNESCO who made something new that would be sustainable from the old one with the same characteristics. How can it be benefited? So, what are the trends? \r\n\r\n00:24:46 BILAL \r\n. I mean. I mean, they grind up the old heroes and remake \r\n\r\n00:24:51 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Frankly, I'm not very familiar with how he did it, but it's his specialty, he has a master's degree in materials, he's a civil engineer, so yeah, he finished the project, he saw that up until now, we've finished rebuilding a large number of houses, and Mosul's reconstruction started in 2017-2018, and up until now, there's no mortar or building mix approved, that's right, we have to do it, this is the heritage building, this is this. There's no M, we tried. We tried not to add it to the door, we tried to see. There are samples that they're working on, and they are this, but is there something that has been given the green light for us to use this, isn't this one? No. M. Honestly, each person has their own direction and each organization, let's say, what are the aspirations of those who use this or something like that? So \r\n\r\n00:25:37 BILAL \r\n, maybe it's one of the things that we can benefit from, I mean, we can do it in a way that's not, I mean, yes. Direct A How do you say that direct in Arabic is this a reflection of what it is? \r\n\r\n00:25:51 FATIMA EYAD \r\nDirect Indirect? \r\n\r\n00:25:53 BILAL \r\nIt means indirectly, but if we work with any architects from any diverse companies, I mean different ones, and we work together on the idea that we go to this idea, I mean everything I liked was that it is the money that you will know what we can help you with with the master’s degree. We should go and explore the city, take notes, what should we write? We should try to think about things like why did they build it this way? Is it open? Is it against the law? And then we put all the methods and all the ideas. Maybe we can put the idea that there is the idea of sustainability, comfort, religion, and I don’t know what else, it’s all connected. We can put this first and then let them go explore and take pictures. This is the beginning of education. This was the idea that we start something, but if we start like this, I expect we can do something for the project, and then the other side. Let's do two things. First, I was thinking of making a FE, not that there's no award for it. But a graduation project for a short course like caps on project she and who mail and 50 feet #1 is in a hurry and wants to build something in this place. If this is the place, we can give options. I mean, one in the middle of the city 1. /. 1 I don't know. I mean, he will destroy and build, I mean, we give and everyone has any, any project, any, and then we ask them that they took the ideas that we saw. And they tried to use the. I mean. Things we can learn from heritage so that we can build again, we don’t have to build like they built, but let’s take their methods and design them with something new, and now when you want to talk, I thought of another idea to add to it, let’s try, as I say in every group that does this training, we take some methods and make some data. Sample models, meaning if someone is willing to put a wall with lighting and insulation at the same time. He just takes the file and uses it. You know better than me that I’m not an engineer, I mean I don’t know, I hardly know material libraries, I don’t know what these things mean, so yes, but if we have these libraries and we can say that he is the one who completes a house project, then we don’t complete the whole project, but the training is part of the training, yes we can make a media, an advertisement from all the architectural companies saying that he is the one who has new houses in Mosul, it’s worth it if they have 12 like that. Oh, participation, but it doesn’t come from one side, it doesn’t come from another side, it comes from knowledge, from knowledge and from practical training. People don’t go and have fun, they see, they think about it, they design, and then we take from Al and Wal. This is a great training. That’s it. We did a training. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:29:05 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Hahaha. The project \r\n\r\n00:29:06 BILAL \r\n. Okay, come on, blessed Friday. We’re going to pray. No, no, thank you no. But honestly, this is it. This is just what I expected, this was the model, the training model, but from my story with you, it came out to me that it means developing the idea that you were doing, but not just practices and we make a poster and announce it and take it, and all the companies that came brought someone to showcase his skills and learn something new and put his name on it, yes, we all shared these ideas and developed them together, yes, we signed them and shared them, not as a poster, but there is a bit of strength in them, because it has all the companies that if the people who came to train together did not come from UNESCO or from, yes, far away, they came from the country, from the people who build it, and if they say, you know what that means? Why did we forget all these things? There are bodies in front of us, let us see them and develop them. We do not have to use a rock or a hole in it so that we have an insulator from the new materials, but let us think about the insulator and then the air, meaning the courtyard. Why do we need to cover the courtyard because it has a reason? Why do we cover something for a reason? Let's think about the reason, but now we have a problem with the size of the houses, I mean, there is a larger population. Should we take the same model? The same idea? But change it to the current reality? So this is the idea of training, it's not that we want to train, but we learn together. What we want to think about. Um, with this training \r\n\r\n00:30:48 FATIMA EYAD, \r\nbut I have a question. I mean, will this topic develop? \r\n\r\n00:30:57 BILAL \r\n. Hello, volunteering? Sorry, the line was cut \r\n\r\n00:31:07 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Okay, it will be voluntary, no \r\n\r\n00:31:08 BILAL \r\n. For the trainers. I expect that there will be a fee for the people who come for training, a fee for knowledge, enthusiasm and time, and that as a result they will work together and have certificates, and these things, which are portfolio pieces, God willing, will be able to help them in the work meeting and things like that. But for Mr. \r\n\r\n00:31:40 FATIMA EYAD \r\n, let me give you my point of view \r\n\r\n00:31:47 BILAL \r\nGo away and blow me away a little. This is my wife, how can she help me in this way? \r\n\r\n00:31:53 FATIMA EYAD \r\nMay God protect her. What do you think the issue will be for the person who comes, that he will teach his salary, that he will take his protocol experience and all these things, right? \r\n\r\n00:32:07 BILAL \r\nI mean, it was one of the ideas, yes \r\n\r\n00:32:11 FATIMA EYAD \r\n, us. When we applied to the ICCROM course, what do you think was the goal of this training? \r\n\r\n00:32:19 BILAL \r\n. They are establishing this new institution so that they can make money from it? What was the goal, tell me? Tell me the amin goal, I mean the goal \r\n\r\n00:32:29 FATIMA EYAD \r\nwith. With the exception of the certificate, it was definitely going to be very strong, and really, honestly, I benefited a lot from this certificate, but I only except for the wages, \r\n\r\n00:32:40 BILAL \r\n. Yes, there is \r\n\r\n00:32:42 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Attention \r\n\r\n00:32:42 BILAL \r\n. And for food, I mean, there is a possibility of a daily wage, yes, but not a guarantee for the people who come, but this is yes, there is a possibility of part of it. But \r\n\r\n00:32:52 FATIMA EYAD \r\nNot another job? \r\n\r\n00:32:55 BILAL \r\nDoes that mean only for transportation? \r\n\r\n00:32:58 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Exactly, exactly, the transportation cost was a certain amount per month, that this is daily attendance, you come to register daily attendance, this is your right, right? The second thing, what motivated us? For example, let's say we excelled in this, the course that there will be job opportunities, for let's say for the committed, the diligent or those who proved their attendance. The one who comes to ask Ahmed. Not everyone. Not all of us \r\n\r\n00:33:29 BILAL \r\n. How would they have been able \r\n\r\n00:33:29 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. They say, I mean, \r\n\r\n00:33:31 BILAL \r\nwe think about it. M. One of them is the idea of the internet and we make contacts with companies just to find, yes, architectural companies, I mean yes, they have an internship field. What else can I find, because there are no companies \r\n\r\n00:33:50 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. No offices, architectural offices, maybe an opportunity to train with them or apply what they learn there \r\n\r\n00:33:57 BILAL \r\nOkay, what do you expect? I mean? This is something we can arrange. You have the names of the offices, meaning we can start communicating and talking to them that we have a few months, I mean we haven’t started. Yes, after July, the training will start, God willing, after July. \r\n\r\n00:34:12 FATIMA EYAD \r\nOh, at least, I will tell you frankly, the construction office, which I believe is present and is a partner with you, Balmo Ahmed, from what he wrote, everything is strong, Ahmed Ahmed Ahmed, listen exactly, exactly, yes exactly, it is a construction office. \r\n\r\n00:34:25 BILAL \r\nYeah, I will talk to him. I talked to him yesterday, hahaha, and so on. He told me well that he can find not only with him, but with his friends. He said that he knows a lot of people who have companies, so he said that he will be able to help with the job interview, so we thought about this topic, I mean we didn’t think about it, but what can I tell you? \r\n\r\n00:34:46 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. I mean, look, as I mentioned a moment ago, the idea is something in our imagination, but we come to implement it in reality, and we come to be with the people of the city? They will eat you, I came exhausted and left my job, and in the end I get something. I mean, do you or I care about the city, do we care? How can there be a good future for the city? But I can't expect that they all have the same goal when they came to train \r\n\r\n00:35:15 BILAL \r\n. So this is good, these are the two things that you shared, meaning that we don’t make it more tiring than necessary in the fee, that’s it, yes I’m talking to the ones who are trying to make sure that at least the fee is paid, and secondly, I started the stages where I looked for the architects, and I talked to Ahmed, but I need more names, so if you have a Facebook page or Instagram, or I can call them and contact them and send them, don’t let them open the doors, so I just need the names, because I don’t need, I need a little bit \r\n\r\n00:35:55 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Okay. There is an office, there is a coordination office. So, hitting the writer who is coming, I’ll tell you that there are a lot of them here, those who have influence, for example, we have a lot, for example, in the university, who can’t graduate, they want to go and train or work, they have weight, I mean. And there are more than one office, I will send you their names on WhatsApp. If you just share your number. And WhatsApp with me so I can be sure \r\n\r\n00:36:23 BILAL \r\n. I mean, the correspondent sent you a message with my number. But forget it now. I'm in France on the phone \r\n\r\n00:36:30 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. American \r\n\r\n00:36:31 BILAL \r\n. And a Daesh member in Iraq and. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:36:36 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Hahaha, okay, no problem. Oh, so these are the things that you're coming to, that we saw, because the ICCROM course they did, yeah, they did a traction, or let's say a second semester or the second part, which had the same material, the same thing for the other 25 trainees, but they couldn't find job opportunities for all those in the second semester, so there was a lot of criticism, there were a lot of problems, so more than once UNITAR held a meeting with us, what did you benefit from ICCROM? Or what did you benefit from the ICCROM course? So the majority of the people in the second semester said that we didn't benefit at all, we didn't apply, we took theoretical, practical application, we didn't find job opportunities, you expect, but you know, the work is tried and tested \r\n\r\n00:37:23 BILAL \r\nPart of the work inside, I mean first we will look for job opportunities, but the idea is that it's the beginning, this is the... I mean, all of these things are from the first half, and then the second half is more practical. But there is a possibility, I don't know if we can do this, I mean, it's difficult for us to choose the, I mean, if we find someone from the class at work, a cousin who has a sister, an uncle, a cousin, I don't know who, who needs a house, hahaha, we take the money for the house and give the family who will live in it all the information we need and we design it based on this so that there is a possibility that one of us will win and the winner will be a practical application. This is all very nice, as you expect. I mean, if we have a room with 20 people, what is the possibility? Someone who knows someone who wants a house? \r\n\r\n00:38:31 FATIMA EYAD \r\nHonestly, honestly, I can't give you a percentage or anything? Um, honestly, I mean, but what you can do is, for example, if we find or for example, we agree to do it in partnership, and with the offices that are coming, so anyone? Those who come, can we request? \r\n\r\n00:38:51 BILAL \r\n. Who cares for them? Profits, right? And no work. No work. No technical, anything new. There is a possibility that they don't use them. Maybe they have to do work in the end, but at least there is this belonging, and we can bring these libraries, this library, Sanaa Souq and Ahmed's library to the last row, they do it, they say, \"Roni, Ronnie, I did it,\" I mean, and then they can do criticism. And in this place, you know what his name is, Ahmed told me. And he says, \"Can you help me? Find them a job?\" Bilal said, \"If I'm there and I see good people, I tell them, without them asking, 'Take them and leave.' This is a very good thing. It's important that we don't find job opportunities, but we find job opportunities for each person. We create space and scope so that people can see them and see their skills. So I think this is a good way.\" \r\n\r\n00:39:57 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Exactly, I mean, we can promise them, or we don't have to promise them, but we tell them that if anyone has a strong idea or a strong project, the offices that are with us can adopt your idea, just like what happened. Honestly, I mean, Engineer Ahmed from the competition that the Chamber of Commerce held, he told them the same thing, that he is ready to adopt the idea, if it is feasible, of course. I mean, it was there, so it was a nice incentive, especially for new youth who are coming and trying to find work or leave their mark, I mean, they can come from this door or that door, and at the same time, there is an idea, but it honestly needs cooperation, and with the government agencies, which I don't recommend at all, but it is very nice and strong that there is currently a project that faces that it is the old city of Mosul, I mean for Mosul, I mean \r\n\r\n00:40:48 BILAL \r\n. Nahrain \r\n\r\n00:40:50 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. No, yes, yes. Okay, no, I don't know \r\n\r\n00:41:01 BILAL \r\nWhy is the first word \"to cover the current one\"? \r\n\r\n00:41:05 FATIMA EYAD \r\nThe facade and the washing? \r\n\r\n00:41:07 BILAL \r\n. The facade, sorry, sorry, sorry, I don't know why. Hahaha. The sound sometimes comes and goes, the facade between the two rivers, okay, go ahead \r\n\r\n00:41:13 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Yes, the riverfront of the old city of Mosul. Currently, there is a project to reconstruct this front. Why? Most of it was houses, so there was a problem with these houses. Who owns them? They are really owned by the government. This is the problem. Frankly, currently, there are plans for new houses. I say, I come to say that in this application, I can apply it to sustain the houses. \r\n\r\n00:41:42 BILAL \r\n. He. Competition, he shari cuts, they subcorn on it, she's on the day, they. \r\n\r\n00:41:51 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. A governmental body, the Mosul Municipality, is supervising the matter, and at the same time, there are inspectors of antiquities and heritage in Nineveh, also supervising the matter and the implementing body. Frankly, I don't know, but it's not governmental, maybe the University of Baghdad or something, but it's from a private company, meaning it's coming to implement the project. \r\n\r\n00:42:09 BILAL \r\nYou know, the Mosul Heritage House, are they part of it? Do they have any connection? \r\n\r\n00:42:14 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n00:42:16 BILAL \r\nOkay, fine, God willing, I'll talk to him, Dhnoon? \r\n\r\n00:42:21 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Ayoub Dhnoon Ayoub. Dhnoon. Ayoub. Dhnoon \r\n\r\n00:42:25 BILAL \r\nI mean, if. If. If this project was done by cooperation, and Ayoub, what do you expect? I mean, how can we benefit from it so that it will be stronger for? For? The architects who come to do training, I mean what? How can we benefit from them more if we do cooperation? And Ayoub Dhnoon? \r\n\r\n00:42:41 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Ayoub, take revenge a little bit, I mentioned that we can do tours of the old city in Ayoub. Did he do this? Did he come and do it? He went to the old city from the schools or from the tourists who came. At the same time, we can use what they have, the redeemer is also available, so that we can display the old buildings or the old things that are there, how is this idea of sustainability that you linked to religion and its equipment that is present in it, so we can use what they have, a large hall, and we can use it, we can use it, I mean, they can use it as a support place, as a support for what they will display, what they will display. \r\n\r\n00:43:22 BILAL \r\nOkay, one of the questions that I have in my head right now, yes, this idea that we talked about is that we start going to do a tour of the old city, and we see the methods, and I mean, what are the reasons? Why all the ... and we do this ... do you expect that architects will see this as a waste of time? If they are going to have fun with the idea and be proud of it and love it, then let's divide it into platforms. There is design and finance, there is a meeting of companies and offices with design, and there is a possibility of working with it, so that's good. But the first part, people will call me by this idea that they find sustainability in the old city. If they say to themselves 1,000,000 times I saw the Al-Nuri Mosque and I mean I came to do it there. So leave me and take me to Europe, almost. I don't know the ... the mentality of architects, and the ... the valve, I mean architects \r\n\r\n00:44:25 FATIMA EYAD \r\nWell, what am I going to tell you? What will shock you? What should I tell you? What should I shock you with? There's an engineer who I used to work with. She sent me a message this morning saying she really misses the old city. When should we go for a visit? \r\n\r\n00:44:37 BILAL \r\nDoes that mean she lives in Al-Mufaddal? \r\n\r\n00:44:39 FATIMA EYAD \r\nHerbs, Nasri's herbs? \r\n\r\n00:44:43 BILAL \r\n. Sweet, so you expect that people, first of all, will take it easy because it's a beautiful old city. We'll bring them tea. Of course, we'll take them up to a house, yes, our house. What's the name of that institution up there? And we'll drink tea there. Yes, God willing. The rent will be paid and the tea will be paid. And do you expect that we'll be able to find people who have one and can see the methods and, and understand this idea that it's not just a form, but it has depth, because I feel that UNESCO, how did they forget it? That professor from UNESCO who tells you to cover the courtyard, how did they forget these things, I mean, but but, I mean, I don't know if the new generation, the youth, and if there is one, they have a different understanding that they enjoy themselves and love this idea. Heritage is the future. \r\n\r\n00:45:39 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. First of all, there was a misunderstanding because my dear professor, he's not from UNESCO. He's from Mosul, a government institution responsible for reconstruction. No. No. This is a point. I need to clarify. No, wasn't UNESCO what? The second thing is, what is it? I have a page on Instagram, my page is private, it's not that it's public and I publish it and such, but it's private and I post pictures, so when I was working with UNESCO, you wouldn't believe the number of people who asked me to take them on a tour of Old Mosul \r\n\r\n00:46:08 BILAL \r\nFrom whom? \r\n\r\n00:46:09 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. No, despite the pictures, I was \r\n\r\n00:46:10 BILAL \r\n, so I'm not from Mosul? \r\n\r\n00:46:13 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. No, from Mosul, no, from Mosul, from the people of the city itself, and on penetrating specializations between engineering, between non-specializations, and a picture that he publishes, not that it is something that is built and beautiful, and is coming, they want to see it, no, I was publishing destroyed houses, I was publishing dead-end roads, and they wanted to see it, and they wanted to get to know them, because it is curiosity, you see, not everyone knows them \r\n\r\n00:46:35 BILAL \r\nOkay, after that? \r\n\r\n00:46:37 FATIMA EYAD \r\nAre you encouraging me? \r\n\r\n00:46:38 BILAL \r\n. The idea is not AM, it became a research workshop. We don't tell people that it is a research, but they don't help us, and if they help themselves, then yes, we take the methods and fill them in a new way within their modern ones that they learned from colleges that they got their information from in Europe and I don't know what, big windows on walls, I don't know what, so we need to go and change the atmosphere a little bit and go to history, and start imagining why they built it this way, I mean, we put ourselves in their mindsets. It's nice for us to leave our phones at home, wear old clothes, and go and try to think about how they designed it, and maybe you know what, I don't know, so it will be a nice failure. We try to do the beginning of the designs if we don't see something nice. I draw it on paper, and with a pen. I like paper. Because a lot of people work at different ages, I expect they have some technicians, I mean they have a love for drawing, but there is a possibility that they focus a hobby on computers because they are fast and I don’t know what, but, I expect that if we are going to talk about heritage, we will divide it into two parts, one part uses pen and paper, so we go for a walk, write, take notes, and the second part uses the computer, and then from that computer we make models, and the design with Ahmed and the offices first \r\n\r\n00:48:13 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Of course, of course, you mentioned it, and this is what happened to me, I am from Aydlan, we had to draw a few houses, I mean mix a few houses until we see what the basics are, so I was really thinking, Oh my God, this is Abu Badr, how did he think of Bani Heichi? What did he mean? Okay? Why? He left this wall here, didn’t he leave it still, okay? What was the idea of the one who left the jar or the falcon on the wall? I mean, so I went out and your friend and I arrived that we analyze long discussions that they are smart in an atmosphere, designed from these houses, not that. And of course despite their simplicity and simple degrees, and now each one of us has his degree, his height, and he comes to reach something that they reached because \r\n\r\n00:48:55 BILAL \r\n. It had an important chain, I mean the architectural people had a vacation, I expect this is something that we must not forget that. I mean, this idea is not from a mother who I don’t know in English or Arabic, what is it, but craftsmanship, I mean? Yes, they would take a vacation to make the zawiya. The zawiya take a vacation to make the ah, the architects, and this is the same model of Sufism, and there is a reason for it. I mean, if you see in North Africa, all the craft people are connected to the ah chain, so the Qadiriyya make zawiya, like this, they make the ah, the ah, the ah, the ceramics, and yes, there is a reason, there is a relationship between these two things, and we are cut off from our chain, yes, in Mosul, I mean, we need to take a second chain, the one who is dead and in the weather for you, it is the weather of Mosul, yes, so we must find the chain, that's it. There are architects who have this chain, now that they live in Mosul, do you expect? They all left, where did they go? Let's find them. Surely there are in the world, sure \r\n\r\n00:50:19 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Hahaha, the idea is there. The idea is that the things that Mosul suffered from had a huge impact on its reconstruction. Documentation was nonexistent. \r\n\r\n00:50:27 BILAL \r\nExplain that to me? \r\n\r\n00:50:28 FATIMA EYAD \r\nIt wasn't. Documentation of anything, whether the decorations or the construction method, started in later periods after many things had disappeared without anyone knowing about them, but I see it, for example, there are many things or many matters that our professors in the department started documenting and it became the basis, and there are many things before anyone documented them. Oh, I mean, you, oh, I mean, you, you were coming to talk about it, I mean, it becomes indirect that we need even, and this is a rule, it is documentation that if you come to do something France 1234 \r\n\r\n00:51:08 BILAL \r\nYes, right, right, this is something important, I expected, I mean, in the beginning, when I was thinking about training, I was thinking more about it, or oh, how can we reach the ideas of the Green House? I will ask you, if you know the Green House and I don’t know what else, I’m a little afraid that I will go back and tell them that I don’t want to teach anything, I want to learn? So, I expect this is something very good. I expect it may be the correct method, because we don’t have a clear idea to be able to tell people what to do. We need, as you said, to get the documents, correct documents, both the old and new ones, not just how they built, but how are we supposed to build after this? I mean, I don’t know if you know, you studied, but when one studies, where do they jump? Anything, if she draws a wall, she draws something. I mean, what do they give to people so that they can jump? Think about the method. Of course, they say how many people will live in the house, what is the size and area, so what are the methods? Are they learning them now and what is missing from them? \r\n\r\n00:52:31 FATIMA EYAD \r\nI mean, aren’t we coming to learn something completely general? For example, if we want to design eggs? Of course, what does the person himself need? What doesn’t he want? Like I mentioned, it depends on the number of people living in the house. At the same time, it depends on personal preference. As a designer, I think that if this room is rectangular, for example, it's better. If it's square, then that's fine. I mean, it's not really about strengthening personal matters, honestly, I can't set a rule here. If you want to do something, you have to follow this, but there is a rule, for example, the space for one person, for rest, for example, how big should it be? So, based on that, I preserve the space size. What will be the relationship between the spaces depending on the privacy of the country itself and the privacy of the region. For example, I leave the one there, I leave the reception here for the bedroom, but this means that... \r\n\r\n00:53:22 BILAL \r\n. A model that almost someone sees in his family's house and builds it after installing another family's house. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:53:29 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Unless he wants to create a box neighborhood, I mean \r\n\r\n... 00:53:32 BILAL \r\n. Architects like to go outside the box, even more, meaning they apply what they see and know. \r\n\r\n00:53:40 FATIMA EYAD \r\nThe truth. \r\n\r\n00:53:42 BILAL \r\nWe need the truth. I mean, if I told you, you'd know the truth . \r\n\r\n00:53:46 FATIMA EYAD Yes, when we were in college, they would tell us what? As much as \r\nyou want, do imaginative things, because when you graduate, it will all be just supplies that you divide. \r\n\r\n00:53:56 BILAL \r\nI mean, there are two houses, yes, yes, A or B. Choose this map. If this map is a solution, I will change it little by little until it expands the area, and this is it. \r\n\r\n00:54:10 FATIMA EYAD \r\nUmm, because frankly I am telling you, I mean, currently the prices are very expensive. A person, for example, cannot think of things. Of course, when will you tell him sustainability, for example, he will tell me, “How much does it cost this much and this much?” and I don’t know what else? The issue is not just about cost. I mean, by God, I can employ the people of the city themselves so that they can produce this thing. This will be the cheapest for me. \r\n\r\n00:54:34 BILAL \r\nAnd not only that, sometimes people forget that the house might cost this much to build, but if it needs air conditioning in summer and winter, yes, because I made it oven-like, yes, it will be more expensive annually. So this is one of the basics that we want to introduce, and what I didn’t talk about is the idea that when people want to sell these things, they must sell them in a way that is not It's sustainability, or it's heritage. This might be it. Plus, but they must tell them that this will benefit you, yes, in these areas, yes, this is correct because it is suitable for the size of the people, and this is the appropriate price, and not only this is the appropriate price, if they adopt it as a house, meaning you don't need this many amperes, you need this many amperes, and in five years, it will save you $1,000, I don't know, I mean, the calculations, if the calculations have to be correct? \r\n\r\n00:55:32 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. And you know, yes, in 2023, the highest temperature recorded in Mosul was 49. Mosul, we were in northern Iraq, and its weather was a bit better than the south, so we are the Redi. We were supposed to come to us well and this way at 49. So, there is a problem coming \r\n\r\n00:55:57 BILAL \r\n, I mean. This root is important for us to think about because if we say we built the same houses from the heritage, the weather will change. There is a possibility that we need to do something more or change it, so this is the idea of the open courtyard. It might be good, but it might need some sand, it might be wind. I don't know that I don't want to imagine now, but it won't solve the problems. We just have to take into account the changing reality so that we can take the heritage and update it. It's not just material, that we don't have these insulating materials that we don't use, we don't hear about rocks, but we have to say that now we have them. I mean, it used to be five times a year, now it's 1,000,000 times a year. So what do we need? We change the design, we take the methods, but we don't have any new reality. It's in this connection between the two that we have to solve the problem. \r\n\r\n00:56:56 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Yield. And the third thing that you are now dealing with is that you dealt with the Musalawi House as if it were an element in itself. The Musalawi House is especially exciting in the old city. It is the shadow of the fabric . \r\n\r\n00:57:09 BILAL . \r\nUnderstand me? \r\n\r\n00:57:10 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. But I am from S. I mean, like Irbid. And what that more, I'm the beautiful. I am from the core. So, I am the one who designed the house. Is it a Chen Shi? It completes something in A. I mean, I am the one who came to design or I want to design. Then, the basic idea is from the old physicality, and that I did not come to deal with one element, which is the house. No, it is the house. They came with the house next to it, and in the same place, they all made them trying to provide a better environment for the resident at the same time for the passerby in the area. \r\n\r\n00:57:47 BILAL \r\nThis. This is one of the sustainability A. But this is one of the most difficult things that A. This needs the government, or I don't know, they all agree on something with each other, because each person builds a house for himself, and the architect comes differently from the other architect and has different ideas, so how do we solve this problem? I mean, what do I see in our project? How can we solve the problem? Neither do we expel her? The problem is, but she's not able. What are you saying? \r\n\r\n00:58:25 FATIMA EYAD \r\nNo, no. Honestly, you said that the designer and the house itself is frankly a house. This is my point of view, that I don't leave it to the designer or the owner of the house to be free. This comes as a law from the state, but you have to do it this way and that way. Why? Because it's not like this because your area is like this because it's like this \r\n\r\n00:58:44 BILAL \r\n. So this \r\n\r\n00:58:45 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. You are the king, frankly \r\n\r\n00:58:46 BILAL \r\n. There is a possibility that we can't. We do it, Tawfiq from the from the. And before they give you, there was this idea that the government must approve the map before it is built, \r\n\r\n00:59:00 FATIMA EYAD \r\nWhat do I know? \r\n\r\n00:59:03 BILAL \r\nWe started with this, the Olins, and little by little, year after year, meaning more and more people know about it, it becomes stronger and stronger, and maybe one day it will be part of the things that the government sees, when someone wants to, I mean, take its map. A. We are not saying that this is our goal, but we are saying that if we do it, at least there will be people who will take care of it, ha girl, ha, I thought that I saw this list, that I heard that they worked on I don’t know what, hahaha. Are you going to come and build? Ha? Is this? I am not thinking about it, huh? You will come to build this government needs you to apply at least 6/10 of these terms so that you have a proof, and one of them has the mobile phones, search like this? \r\n\r\n00:59:54 FATIMA EYAD \r\nHonestly, honestly. A. The timing of this course will be very golden, because I am currently in an Italian company that will redo the master plan for the city of Mosul. So if I come to work simultaneously with it, it is possible that many things will change \r\n\r\n01:00:15 BILAL \r\nThis is an Italian company \r\n\r\n01:00:18 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. What I know is that any governorate, cooperating or contracting, an Italian company went to redo the master plan and the master plan for the city of Mosul \r\n\r\n01:00:29 BILAL \r\nAnd the houses, what does that mean? It doesn't mean that everything in Mosul is big, hahaha, a company? \r\n\r\n01:00:36 FATIMA EYAD \r\nIsn't it? \r\n\r\n01:00:38 BILAL \r\nIs there a plan that has billions of dollars, not 1,000,000? \r\n\r\n01:00:43 FATIMA EYAD \r\nAnd maybe more, I mean, hahaha, but the idea is that in the eighties, there was a plan, but it wasn't implemented, or part of it wasn't implemented, and you left out other parts. I mean, there was a problem with the issue, so they're trying to develop it, that there are reserve places that will be used, I mean, they'll remove them and do them. I mean, why not? Why not, why not? \r\n\r\n01:01:09 BILAL \r\n. Let's see. Do you know the name of the company? Do you know anything about the company so we can find out more about it? I mean, information, yes. \r\n\r\n01:01:19 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. And you see, Dr. Omar, the group, according to what I saw . \r\n\r\n01:01:23 BILAL \r\n. His name is \r\n\r\n01:01:28 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Ah, this is them. It was Musa who I explained about the house project. Above, I find him known every year. And her graduation supervisors \r\n\r\n01:01:44 BILAL \r\n. Human \r\n\r\n01:01:47 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. My professor, and my supervisor on the graduation project \r\n\r\n01:01:50 BILAL \r\n. Good. Good \r\n\r\n01:01:52 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. He doesn't have a new PhD. Architecture by systems, by systems, according to what I remember. His PhD is in architecture and everything. He loves the old city and is very attached to it and is trying to do, let's say it's a redevelopment inspired by the old. Let's say it's a redevelopment, I mean it will be very beneficial. Good \r\n\r\n01:02:16 BILAL \r\n. Good. Omar Adel. Come on now. I have to call him as soon as possible. And get ideas from him. Do you expect? So you scared me now? I'm afraid this is gone. The idea is about us and he laughs, do you expect he will like the training idea or not? I mean, what do I mean, how can I improve it before I talk to Omar? I mean, I don’t know what he means by the subject, hahaha \r\n\r\n01:02:40 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. We hear them on the matter, he is a very humble person, I mean, it’s not that he has a PhD, I mean, he is, no, no, very humble and he loves these movements, he loves to support the youth, my love for the old city, and my attachment to it is a big part of it, from it, I mean, he made me love the old city in this way, and we think that I or it is my city, I mean, if I don’t try to develop it, what. What is my position in Iraq? It’s a city, so I am. Why? I told you his name specifically? Because he is currently a member of the Engineers Syndicate in Mosul, but I told you when I saw the advertisement for this master plan. And I saw the advertisement \r\n\r\n01:03:17 BILAL \r\n. Explain this in English, he means he has a group \r\n\r\n01:03:21 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Engineers, no, the Engineers Syndicate, what does it mean, for example, it is a cult of a party in it, all engineers are included in it, just like if I have an ID that I am affiliated with the Syndicate ID, the Syndicate is supposed to provide me with job opportunities, provide me with protection through laws, if something happens, it doesn't happen, I mean through implementation, but of course this is all ink on paper, nothing happens, if it happens, it doesn't happen unfortunately. \r\n\r\n01:03:47 BILAL \r\nsomething? Unfortunately, I mean do you drink from tea? \r\n\r\n01:03:50 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. From the Syndicate members, I only have an ID and affiliated members by profession, among them are Dr. Omar and the head of the Architectural Division, Dr. Bassam. Do they know anything? I saw the advertisement, I'm just the advertisement. So I think they have more information than me about the Italian company, so? You have more information than me about the Italian company \r\n\r\n01:04:15 BILAL \r\n. What should I tell him about this topic? Our concern is that the union is the one who can document the documents that we fill with, if we work with them more from the beginning, I know that Dr. Bassam is the one who works on greens and jars, there is a possibility that we can do it like I regret. The ululations, the green ululations \r\n\r\n01:04:39 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Ee. Ee. \r\n\r\n01:04:42 BILAL \r\nThe green building constitution is possible, I mean I don’t know how to talk to them, but there is a possibility that the ideas that come out of this training, we can Ee. Ee. I mean, find a place for them inside this ME, what is its name? \r\n\r\n01:04:59 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. At the same time, in the union, Dr. Bassam is a member of the Deanship of the College of Engineering at the University of Mosul, so he will be the most likely to attract new students or new graduates. Spread the word, what are the chances of attracting people who are passionate about the subject, or who love it or are familiar with it? So, if you head in that direction, it will be stronger with you in this place . \r\n\r\n01:05:24 BILAL \r\nIt's all very nice, very nice, Umm Zain. So, do you have any questions for me now? I expect we've reached the hour mark and I want to see, I mean, if there's anything else on your mind, you should know that if you have a question about anything, you should know? \r\n\r\n01:05:40 FATIMA EYAD \r\nWhat is honesty, I mean? I did it quickly with you, I talked about everything that came to my mind, so honestly, it wasn't because it came to my mind, and I felt it was a project. \r\n\r\n01:05:49 BILAL \r\nThe idea of training is nice. The method we designed is that there is research, then application, then formation with companies, something like that, and the result that we do develops every time we do the training develops \r\n\r\n01:06:05 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Oh, the other logical system, the first thing I see with my own eyes, do I search and get information from where? I have a real example. My city is an old city. Then, how can I develop it, which is the practical application? What will I do? Then? The final result, I mean, is the. It is the right path for any course, it is possible for a result to come out \r\n\r\n01:06:26 BILAL \r\n. And what do you expect? Ah ah, so I mean we met in July, and I mean I did this design, and we met with the ah you find, I mean ah pray, ah come, there is a possibility that you will be one of the trainers, I mean you have a desire to be, I mean, to manage, maybe 20 people in this field, in this model, I can say anything, please \r\n\r\n01:06:58 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Of course, the topic, I mean, I will tell you is far, far removed from everything I said about the heritage and the old city \r\n\r\n01:07:04 BILAL \r\n. Let me talk about anything. Yes. 01:07:07 \r\n\r\nFATIMA EYAD \r\n. Currently, I am working at the Mosul headquarters in Mosul. At the airport, I am supposed to finish ten or six, and deliver the project. It won't happen, this will happen, let's say that before 10:6 and after 10:6 it will be like Face Two or something, meaning it is also a project, at the same time, at the same time I got a contract with the government, with a government agency, to work, to work, to work. One of the conditions of this government is that I do not work in the private sector \r\n\r\n01:07:39 BILAL \r\n. This is not a private sector, this is an organization, I mean, one of the nations \r\n\r\n01:07:45 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Okay, I mean. I mean, what is it from? I'm telling you, the Financial Audit Bureau? I mean, I work with integrity, with integrity. I mean, my position is very sensitive. So I even told Abdullah frankly and he communicated with me, so I told him, Abdullah, that I cannot go out with my name or my personality. I don't know frankly, I mean, it's only been two weeks since I started working, so I don't know frankly, I mean, the sensitivity of the issue, how much I can do, I hope. I hope. I hope. I wish, I wish a lot, I mean why really I love my city, I want to develop it, I want to have \r\n\r\n01:08:20 BILAL \r\n. He thought it would benefit your master's, I mean the Tajin after the data Ts, I mean you take all the pictures of all the students and every thousand I mean he wants haha \r\n\r\n01:08:31 FATIMA EYAD \r\nThe research will be, I mean. But let me see, I'll check the situation with my colleague, if he doesn't have a problem, he won't create any conflict for me, any conflict, of course, I mean when? \r\n\r\n01:08:45 BILAL \r\nShort, short, I mean, we think that it's only six days, something like that, and we can do it on the, I mean, we will cooperate on the schedule that suits you in the end, I mean, we will do this session to adjust the model, how will we implement this training? Where are the trainers, and if we mean we invite you if you can, you can, and then you will know more, because it will be in the seventh month, half of the seventh month, and you will see what happened in your life, and they will tell you, maybe there is a possibility, right? God willing, no, you don’t know what will happen? And. But with all the best, and I mean, don’t, don’t mess up reliable work with something short, I mean, this is a possibility, but you know, we will do it four times, we don’t know how much, but everything I benefited from and had fun, and with you I learned as I expected, I was going to learn a hobby and um, this is the idea of the constitution, and the idea of the A, I mean, that I talk with someone called Omar Adel and the bridge, I mean, I learned a lot of things, thank God \r\n\r\n01:09:56 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. They are two things that took two things. I took a long time, and God knows, but bear with me. What, if I mentioned to you the Mosul Riverfront Project? Oh, honestly, she asked me who the implementing company was. I mentioned that the WhatsApp group I joined was for an engineer named Yamama Yamama. She went back to work there. Now she's with the implementing company, so maybe you can make it easier. Inquire about the details. The subject will benefit you more. She's working with the Redi. They worked with WERSK and UNESCO before at Al-Nouri Mosque, and she has experience . \r\n\r\n01:10:31 BILAL \r\nI'm getting ideas about the, this is the training idea, and we'll see if she has any A.M. I mean, any comments. If she wants, does she have the opportunity to do training? \r\n\r\n01:10:42 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. And she's more involved, because honestly, she went and worked on the side. She worked with offices and designed houses. I honestly didn't get any of my Master's training, so I didn't get any, so she'll benefit you more, on this point. Oh, the second thing and the most important, oh for me, is that I mentioned to you that I attended the first session, oh, it was you and two from the E, oh, I was really impressed by your personality and your style of presentation, so that from that time, I wanted to become like Bilal, I am Bilal Sha Zawiya, I mean, I searched the house even for the country, the country of this Iraqi-American person who came as an excuse and this, no, no, he will \r\n\r\n01:11:25 BILAL \r\nembarrass me? \r\n\r\n01:11:27 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. No, no, it's not between us, that's it \r\n\r\n01:11:29 BILAL \r\nPraise be to God. Praise be to God, but I mean, yes, it's possible, it's possible that you can help me if you understand me, I mean, what do I do? If sometimes I don't know, I mean, what is useful, what is not useful, even I improve the method of style, the eloquence, yeah, yeah, what was the favorite thing that differentiates me, I mean, why, why? \r\n\r\n01:11:51 FATIMA EYAD \r\nWhy my language? \r\n\r\n01:11:52 BILAL \r\nIf I had spoken English, it would have been a better and easier hobby, but with this double width, I want to know, what color can be better? And what was it, do you expect it to be better with it? \r\n\r\n01:12:04 FATIMA EYAD \r\nThe problem is not with the language, I mean, first of all, we know okay, you know, your mother tongue is English, not Arabic, but first, we were always in the session, most of us knew English and Arabic, so what was I doing between the two, it wasn't on the subject, so this was something, I mean, honestly, I didn't pay attention to it at all, M. But the personality, what were you dealing with us again? Who were we who came from. The whole college was a formality, Anstad, a doctor, so you, you mean, you were one of us, and between you, the personality, the graves that you have from the Lord of the Worlds, glory be to Him, M.? How do you deal with him? He's seeing us for the first time. I mean, it's not like we're strangers. He came here feeling sensitive about them. He's worried that they'll understand my English, I don't know what. On the contrary, this is how I am, I'm naturally, and I tried to make things simple. Things, I mean, how much can you do? \r\n\r\n01:12:59 BILAL \r\nYes, yes, I expect this. This is one of the things that I always try to do. Yes, I have, like we said about the methods, about the homes, I have methods for dealing with people. Yes, and it is that I want to see the best parts of the people around me. So, what is the way that I can open up the field? Even people can enlighten themselves, even I enlighten them, that I am the moon and the sun, sometimes this, I mean someone needs to come humble and open the way for conversation, etc. So I always come and try to think because sometimes I see that the room is large, full of beautiful minds, hearts and souls, but how can we create an environment around us, so that these people intend and grow and we share it? This is always the question and the methods are towards this question, just as there are many types that come out, you may not be like Bilal, but I encourage you if you want to share this idea with me, how can I? By mixing the environment and the environment that intends the best things from the people around me, or I mean in your own way, \r\n\r\n01:14:25 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. No, not only, I mean, it's definitely every person, or its charisma and presence, but what color do you give? Is there definitely a twitch, or a tricks, maybe the person uses it, even how does he give greenlight in exchanges, because you say that I won't judge you, that I won't think if you say a wrong idea, I'll detract from you, or what, what are you saying? You? People have known this for a long time, yes, you say that I will appreciate everything you say, even if I've heard it 100,000 times before. But no, that's it, hahaha \r\n\r\n01:14:59 BILAL \r\n. My gain that people stuff. Hahaha. They will feel important. Wow, just a moment \r\n\r\n01:15:05 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Hahaha. Exactly. Right, so you were organizing this feeling, it's the reaction on your face. It's raising your eyebrows and your eyes. This is a character or something that I've heard for the first time, and I might memorize it anyway. I mean, it's not just the first time I've heard it, but you're coming to say that no, you're saying something, I don't know it, or I heard it once that had an effect on you from saying it. \r\n\r\n01:15:28 BILAL \r\nThis is important, because this is a very important idea that I don't know if I want to miss it inside, Tio Ti or no. Tioti, there are people who won't be Bilal, right? And I want to give them the method that they will use to present the ah ah project, ah but I am afraid that the way I deal with it is not very formal, and there is a possibility that I am different from the Iraqi environment, the fun, people are used to it, and they will see if I try to convince them to be a little more relaxed and open and I don’t know what, there is a possibility that people will not see any value in it, they will say this is trivial, trivial, he doesn’t know anything, he will listen to me, I mean the teacher has to tell me you know because I am afraid that people will see this as something, I mean just like I am afraid now that he will go to the and I will tell them you know what we don’t know and it doesn’t matter, we don’t know, let’s do the training so that we know this, something, umm not everything in the world, people like to hear it, they like to hear we know that’s what we will do, \r\n\r\n01:16:35 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. And this will be \r\n\r\n01:16:36 BILAL \r\n. The result will be only. Training, where people say what will we learn? And I tell them, come on, I'm carrying a mirror for you, you say what will you see with it? I mean? Who will value this idea? Understandably, I'm afraid that there are people who will see it as worthless. \r\n\r\n01:16:57 FATIMA EYAD \r\nLook, what's the problem? What is our definition of value? Do they have a material goal in mind for the subject? The media goal for the subject that exists, like you and I, from the city, how will we build a future for our people? What will happen to the generations after us? You attract these people whose goal is material. They will definitely not come. Honestly, I mentioned to you that it's wages and you make wages, but the first date, I mean. A close portion of them will come. Those whose goal is media will come. I contributed, I tried. A. I have an impact on society. I mean, specifically if we give them the idea that you are not just a witness to the destruction of the city, but that you are trying to rebuild it after the destruction that happened to it. So, we can come to them from this \r\n\r\n01:17:43 BILAL \r\npeople’s eyes, I mean, we put them on a post of people who did a good project, I mean, we can spread it with countries, I mean, this is not just a social media post certificate, I mean, sometimes these days I expect this is stronger than a certificate, so. It’s a nice thing, and maybe it’s a good thing? \r\n\r\n01:18:06 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Exactly, I saw that I mean, for example, they put me in the caption, as if these are the people who came to change the future of the city of Mosul after the destruction that happened, I mean, there are things, I mean, you know better than me, honestly, I mean, hahaha, you know more about smuggling than me, but I came to tell you what are the things that affected the ICCROM course on me or on the people who were training with us, the appreciation that was given, I mean now, for example, the simplest thing that happened that I was very happy about is that UNESCO took pictures of us and they are now in the old alleys, you go and see them, thanks so-and-so, I contributed to the reconstruction, and I was part of the fig \r\n\r\n01:18:43 BILAL \r\n. And they all \r\n\r\n01:18:44 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. One \r\n\r\n01:18:46 BILAL \r\n. But there \r\n\r\n01:18:47 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. They selected certain parts, let's be a selection of a certain number of people, so we try to destroy the balloon on these things, I mean. I attract the lucky people, I get this opportunity, so which one goes to the old one? Which one goes to the old one and takes a picture, you see Fatima what comes there, Fatima this is your picture here, this is it \r\n\r\n01:19:09 BILAL \r\n. No. We didn't think of it. Yes, but you were going to tell me that I still have this question, no. No. The solution is how can we get people to value something that they are just jumping to the plate to give value to those who sacrifice their own effort for it? That they didn’t come here to fill a cup; they came even to work. I mean, just like someone goes to a coach and the coach gives her a job, so she has to pay me as a coach, meaning a trainer. But if I tell you to run, this value is reversed. It’s not that you pay me and I give you food. If that, I give you a meal. If that, I do something for you. No, you come and I tell you what to do. Hahaha, so this is training . \r\n\r\n01:19:54 FATIMA EYAD \r\nI mean, wait a minute. You mean that the person who will come will train. What is her goal from the training? Or what is the conviction that might come? \r\n\r\n01:20:02 BILAL \r\nI mean? What aren’t her goals? But how can we make him see that this has value when we don't tell him that we will teach him all the... but we tell him that we will go explore and talk with each other and try to learn from the heritage and... so on the contrary, I let them, they do the work, what do I give them? What information do I give? \r\n\r\n01:20:31 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Okay? So you can work on the suspense aspect in this case, so see what we will do, yes let's say a trip, how can we get to know the city of Mosul? And what will we get out of these explorations that we can use in its reconstruction, right? And its reconstruction doesn't have to be linked to heritage, no, its reconstruction in an advanced way, I mean, not just because there is currently confusion about reconstruction, I mean you will go back to the same old way, no, that's not what I mean, I mean \r\n\r\n01:21:01 BILAL \r\n. E E \r\n\r\n01:21:01 FATIMA EYAD \r\nMost of the time, it will be on social media. I mean, what could the course be? Maybe in iChrome, it wasn't a regular class where I would come and sit and find classes and lectures. No, it was all about groups. We would work on discussions together, right? It was within an hour. Come on, what are the things that you came up with? Do them for me, give me examples of MFA? \r\n\r\n01:21:26 BILAL \r\nWhat's the duration? How long? How long was the training with Ikram? And what topics did you study? \r\n\r\n01:21:34 FATIMA EYAD \r\nYes, I remember, but if you extend it, you'll be shocked, honestly. It was longer, eight months \r\n\r\n01:21:42 BILAL \r\nBut not daily \r\n\r\n01:21:44 FATIMA EYAD \r\nNo, daily. Daily and in hahaha \r\n\r\n01:21:50 BILAL \r\nOne, two hours 1,000,000 logs. How many hours in a day? \r\n\r\n01:21:54 FATIMA EYAD \r\nFrom 9:00 in the morning until four? \r\n\r\n01:21:57 BILAL \r\n. This is college \r\n\r\n01:22:01 FATIMA EYAD \r\nand we came to have fun, I mean I graduated from here, and I entered the course from here, I mean it wasn't that I had extra pressure, yes the thing that I liked most is that I came to deal with them, foreign professors, I mean they come from France, from a long time ago, from America, and if it's one of us. T. I mean, how are you with them? \r\n\r\n01:22:21 BILAL \r\n. Nice, and the people who you mean the ones who integrated with it are the ones who founded the institution from it, right? 01:22:33 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Until yesterday, he found the other a job opportunity or maybe we could meet for a while, I mean no. No, we are in contact, of course, it depends on each person and their ability to do what they might try to do between these two results, but it means \r\n\r\n01:22:47 \r\n\r\nBILAL . \r\nI mean, are you thinking, if there is any way we can keep the project going after years, but the training is short-lived, because I want to move from the implementation, we want 100 houses to be built in Mosul and outside Mosul, and I don't know what else, so I'm trying to see if there is communication between the training and at least maybe we can do a monthly Mira in Mosul, for the people who graduated, graduates, not just graduates, for this where all the graduates meet? from pizza and they stuff it, so they learned and found work, so we keep it as a support group for people who don't need it in the field \r\n\r\n01:23:37 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Exactly, and frankly you will be the one who knows the most about the subject, because most of the people I hear from, I mean, from comfort and studied in America, they used to say it's more of a French thing than a lecture, and so what were you trying to do? To make it? But you mentioned a point, everything is important a while ago, what can you do to convince the professors who are coming to give you lectures or T&Ts that you are not Form M, but I tell you that my position is this, I am this. So don't try to bring up this subject, especially university professors, because this subject is a bit sensitive for them. Hahaha, I didn't take a very good environment. I mean, not all of them, no, I swear I'm talking \r\n\r\n01:24:15 BILAL \r\n. Oh, Dr. Bassam, he said, you have to stuff it, oh, the head of the... I mean college, and he talks to someone else, and then you can talk to him and he makes a meeting, he can't go and meet with him, he comes, I don't know why \r\n\r\n01:24:32 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. The positions are a bit here, it's affected a lot, I mean, hahaha, whatever. Yes, but he's coming, I mean, Dr. Omar doesn't have that thing, to be honest, I mean, to some extent, I communicated with him, but he's a very comfortable and humble person, so I mean, he's always going to be very helpful to you in this matter, and he's not above, he's not immediately, I mean, when we meet him outside the college, I mean \r\n\r\n01:24:54 BILAL \r\n. Honestly, yes, and you know what? The best thing is when someone turns the class from teacher to students and makes everyone say teachers to each other that the trainer can be at the same level, and then the knowledge because everyone has a small part, so what is more important than the knowledge, I don’t know, I mean this is my job and it has been for me, I mean I’ve been working on it for years, or I always feel it’s one paper after another that yes yes is the smartest person in the room, it’s the whole room and I might have information and I want to participate and I want to see who is smart here, but when I ask if someone listens and asks more there is a possibility that he will come up with ideas that he was new to say and the ideas are more calculated and better, and then people either delve into the idea because it came from them, they worked on it a little, not that I gave it to them, I mean now it goes to GPT or Google. Discussing she architecture talk reha it’s. A scene. But, budget and see her. But when you go to Mosul and see the buildings and think about them and take notes on the sun, physics, heat, air, and I don't know what else, it will be, God willing, and when you do it all together, it will be a nice relationship, God willing. I will take some of this and we will change the rest now. The rest will be a little more formal, because it is a little technical. Electricity, I don't know what? Solar energy? Yes, but I will try. I expect that I will be able to make people say, haha, I will show them. Yes, two pictures. I mean, a solar design. This one did it, right? Did he do it wrong? Find all the mistakes. There are 15 mistakes and explain to me why? So we will keep it like the fastest training like this. Ours goes out to explore and they have to learn and deepen it. \r\n\r\n01:26:55 FATIMA EYAD . \r\nAnd the fastest group can find 15 mistakes \r\n\r\n. 01:26:58 BILAL \r\n. Yes. That's nice. Now. You made it a trained voice game. We have to wait six months or 66 to know. See you in July. God willing. \r\n\r\n01:27:12 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. But I mean, I can't \r\n\r\n01:27:14 BILAL \r\n. But yeah, these are all great ideas, and I mean, I'm really happy to meet you again. This is one of the things I don't like about big rooms, that people don't get to know each other. It's 1:30, and now it's not everything, but we're starting to get to know each other a little bit and see where our goals are going? And yeah, I really had fun with you \r\n\r\n01:27:38 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. By God, me too, a lot. Thanks, although honestly, I mean, I'm telling you, right now there's a lot of pressure with research, but I want to meet you. I want, what's his name? He shared these ideas, so thank you very much, thank you for your time too \r\n\r\n01:27:50 BILAL \r\nThank you. And if you could help me, Bimmama. A. Omar Adel, I can find it. And I don't know what happened. Send me the picture. Anything but a picture of the Qan, the Qantara. Oh yes, it would be nice, God willing. What do you do at the airport? I mean, what do you do? What do you do at the airport? \r\n\r\n01:28:11 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Very far from heritage? From heritage. But the same idea, that I want to be the one who leaves a mark in rebuilding the city, not just witnessing its destruction. This was my goal from it. I came out so far that I am not a person, okay, like more than a few 1,000,000. What was inside the city? It is okay, we all suffered from the destruction. We suffered. No, I want the one who is the person who tried to change it. Umm, what is it? Honestly, most of it is in translation. What is this? Can I speak good English? Companies, a Turkish company responsible for the airspace at Mosul Airport, they supported that, meaning they would leave the plan and the details to them, the Nineveh Governorate does not deal with books or official matters in English, which requires the same language at the same time. The company is headquartered in Ankara, so it does not have anyone here in Mosul, and I am its representative in Mosul, between me and the coordination between those on the site and the company, meaning \r\n\r\n01:29:12 BILAL \r\n. I mean, you're not putting yourself in a really nice place, I mean, you see a hobby, things, you see how people work, what a project like this big airport, something, I mean, first of all, like what you're saying, it's our most important thing, like the E E Mosul area, it's coming back, I mean, when an airport comes to it and people come from far away, this is really nice, and you're part of it, and if you see a lot of people and how they work and oh, how big projects they work on, then you take it, I mean, what great experience and what a great project, and God willing, you have the new job, yeah, good luck, and let's see you in July, a day or two, we'll see what happens \r\n\r\n01:29:55 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. God willing, God willing, God willing, good, thank you very much. To you, what do you need? I'm here even if I can't be with you in July. Whatever you need, God willing, I'll take your number and send you the details. \r\n\r\n01:30:08 BILAL \r\n. I mean, anyone who needs it, think about the project. I still don't know a lot of people in insulation. If you have the number of anyone who works in insulation, I mean? Insulation? A company you know, or someone who knows about it, let me call them. \r\n\r\n01:30:31 FATIMA EYAD \r\nWhat are you two specializations in? Isn't it necessarily architecture? \r\n\r\n01:30:33 BILAL \r\nM, I'm not sure that's the case. The subject isn't specific. It's clear that it benefits them. Right, they apply the architectural approach. Architecture is the name, it's the name, but there isn't anyone who goes to college to study. I mean, there is. What? Okay, and then in the end, it's its application. I mean, we get to it that yes, people think more about insulation meters and insulation and find work and job opportunities in this field. So, it's not entirely clear. The idea is that it's not a job. There isn't \r\n\r\n01:31:12 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. Not \r\n\r\n01:31:13 BILAL. \r\nThere isn't, I mean, it connects the means. There is a means. There is a means. Ahmed, who means he's building it. And who is thinking about it? I mean, this is a bit unclear? \r\n\r\n01:31:27 FATIMA EYAD \r\n. I just thought of this person that I told you about. He's trying to change the old one to something new, so I'm going to contact him to see how far it goes, and I'll let you know, God willing. Ok, the delay. Thanks, thanks myself."

Great \r\n\r\n00:00:19 LARSA EMAD \r\nIs the screen working? How long does the camera work? \r\n\r\n00:00:23 BILAL \r\n. Wait a minute, I'll look for \r\n\r\n00:00:26 LARSA EMAD \r\nany medicine on the stick until I see the new laptop, so maybe there's a glitch in the settings hahaha \r\n\r\n00:00:32 BILAL \r\n. Great, congratulations \r\n\r\n00:00:34 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Thank you \r\n\r\n00:00:35 BILAL \r\n. This is the first time I've heard of it \r\n\r\n00:00:37 LARSA EMAD \r\nIs it true? \r\n\r\n00:00:39 BILAL \r\nWhat is it? \r\n\r\n00:00:40 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:00:41 BILAL \r\nDo you understand? \r\n\r\n00:00:44 LARSA EMAD \r\n. What's normal? Normal. Speak English, what's normal? I like math, what's wrong? I use your camera or. What? Right? Honestly, that's the name of a pill. Do I know it in Iraq? Hahaha. Ok, sorry, but the camera isn't working? I don't know, would you like to switch to zoom or something? As you wish? As you wish. Like, I mean \r\n\r\n00:01:49 BILAL \r\n. I have. I have zoom, we can try, let's try zoom \r\n\r\n00:01:51 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Let's try, what's wrong with it? I don't know the program \r\n\r\n00:01:59 BILAL \r\n. It looks like a Musalawi, you, if you notice \r\n\r\n00:02:02 LARSA EMAD \r\nHow? \r\n\r\n00:02:03 BILAL \r\nDo you have a Muslawi accent? \r\n\r\n00:02:06 LARSA EMAD \r\nA little? Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:02:08 BILAL \r\n. I said they were interested \r\n\r\n00:02:11 LARSA EMAD \r\n. This is the accent I'm investigating with Mosul. But this accent is with. And Furaa Fad means that I am a Muslawi, while I don't like to speak Muslawi \r\n\r\n00:02:25 BILAL \r\n. Okay, I'll open the now and send you the accent in just a minute. Oh, weird, listen to me. Ha. Ha. No, God willing. Hello. Ha, take out the camera. Wait, okay, that's it, no isolation, let's turn off the zoom, we don't need it anymore \r\n\r\n00:03:01 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Okay \r\n\r\n00:03:01 BILAL \r\n. Hey, we learned something new today, \r\n\r\n00:03:03 LARSA EMAD \r\nGod willing. Hey, turn off the zoom, it's not necessary, hahaha. What did I do? I went out and fed back the whole thing from the beginning. What did I do? I went out? And I entered the whole thing from the beginning from the beginning. He asked me, do you want to use the voice and camera or not? So, before that, did you do it? \r\n\r\n00:03:20 BILAL \r\nGod willing, okay, where do we start? Let's start from the beginning, okay, a little introduction, God willing. I replied, do you know that before I start with the introduction, what do you know about the house project? I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you just installed the headphones and the computer, okay, now we install the headphones again, does it work? Okay, so what are you asking about? \r\n\r\n00:03:49 LARSA EMAD \r\nDo you know? \r\n\r\n00:03:51 BILAL \r\n. The goal of the project is to know the color of the clearest things, and I mean, I do the knowledge from there \r\n\r\n00:04:01 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Honestly, according to what I know, I communicate with him, Professor Abdullah from Mosul Space. Are we communicating with our office? What are they working on? A project on three walks, meaning three topics, in cooperation with the \r\n\r\n00:04:16 BILAL \r\n, right? Yes, right, and I am one of the 00:04:35 LARSA EMAD, meaning I work with the and I am trying to do a few things. I want to try to find people who have information, take from \r\n\r\n00:04:35 LARSA EMAD \r\n. They have \r\n\r\n00:04:36 BILAL \r\nthe information, and I will install the training, so I mean, I will do the training, and then. And one of the things that if I try to do is I find the trainers at the same time, right? \r\n\r\n00:04:46 LARSA EMAD \r\nOkay, will you do it for you, okay? \r\n\r\n00:04:48 BILAL \r\nThe call, God willing, is that what? \r\n\r\n00:04:52 LARSA EMAD \r\nYou're clearly showing up. \r\n\r\n00:04:53 BILAL \r\nYou know, a hobby, something about a hobby, things? So he can focus on the insulator, and I can focus on solar energy, but let's focus on one of the three topics, and let's talk about training, I mean before I tell you the idea of training, I want to get ideas from you, see what if you were going to do a training, what would you do, and then the training on it, and so on, and then in the end, are you encouraged to be a trainer or not, yes yes, go ahead. \r\n\r\n00:05:23 LARSA EMAD \r\nLook, let me give you, let me, give you an introduction, let me give you an introduction about myself, so you also want to know what level I know? I know the information. Hahaha, okay yes. My name is Laeesa. I know the name. I was born in 1997. I graduated from Dahab University, Civil Engineering Department. That's right. But to be honest, after I graduated, I didn't work directly in engineering. I worked with organizations. My first project was with the Liberation Association for Development here in Mosul. Then I worked with the Zayan Foundation. It was a short time, then I worked with Caritas Iraq. If you've heard of Caritas, if you've heard of the Caritas organization. I was working as a provider of psychological and social care. Then I went back to work with Gian Kabron Korden. And the last thing I did was work two years ago. Also. I went back to work with the Couts again, but as a project officer, meaning I was in charge of a specific area. I was in charge of a project for the, meaning the Telkaf district, because I'm originally from Alqosh, in the Kif district, so I worked as a project officer for this place. I also give TOT courses as a hobby, and I present courses, \r\n\r\n00:06:44 BILAL \r\nHow long ago? \r\n\r\n00:06:45 LARSA EMAD \r\nThis topic, but recently I went back to engineering. Why? Yes? Stocks. Okay. Our funding was cut off. Our program was funded by the, as you know, and it was closed a few months ago, about 34 months. I mean, I wanted to go back to engineering a long time ago, but honestly, you don't, I mean, when you commit to a project and you see, I mean, you love it, you don't want to give it up. Oh, but right now, my concern is, let's say, I have a contract with the government as an engineer, but my concern is that I've grown up, so we can consider it. There, my concern is that I have work, but that's why I wanted to tell him now that it's time for me to go back to engineering, and let's say develop myself in it more and more. It's been two or three months now, I'm back to engineering. So right now, as far as engineering information is concerned, it's practical in the field. I don't have a hobby, but I like to search far away. I like to learn. Is that a hobby? And then, for example, what do we do? Of course, in my previous job, that's what we used to do. Exploiting these things as a hobby, but what do you mean, were these things about the youth, I mean, something far from engineering, but with this, I mean, the idea is that, excuse me, I mean, I'm presenting these things, they're all good, so let's go back and teach them, we'll combine a curriculum and learn it and give it another time \r\n\r\n00:08:28 BILAL \r\nOn the contrary, God willing, I started as an engineer, I studied programming and founded a robotics company, I was doing money, I was doing lab robots, what's the color of AI, this is my history and what I do, and then I thought about them being able to solve a problem, okay, problem after problem, through the engineering method, if I could be a trainer and teach people to think about solving problems and solving problems more of a hobby, okay, so as a strategic way of thinking, I took the training side, and then I deepened \r\n\r\n00:09:03 LARSA EMAD \r\nwith training and \r\n\r\n00:09:04 BILAL \r\n. Oh, what I got to later, what you were calling it is good. I got to the point that if someone has the knowledge and the ability, but he is depressed hahaha. Oh, he has no hope for the future. Oh, he has no self-confidence. Oh, he doesn’t know how to deal with people. He stays in the room all day. Nothing will happen. The change will not happen. What I noticed is that they have to be together. The idea has to be to develop oneself, develop one’s mind, and develop the overall art and society. I mean, because we influence each other. Oh, so what does that mean? \r\n\r\n00:09:49 LARSA EMAD \r\nOf course, interaction with the community. I mean, is it the most important thing? \r\n\r\n00:09:53 BILAL \r\nI got to where you work, and now you’re back on my schedule. God willing, we’ll meet in the middle, okay? \r\n\r\n00:10:00 LARSA EMAD \r\nHahaha \r\n\r\n00:10:01 BILAL \r\n. Civil engineering, which \r\n\r\n00:10:03 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Hahaha. You know, sometimes, I mean, it doesn't mean that I didn't like engineering, or I like it now, or the opposite, but it's like opportunities that come, for example, in particular, you know, in Iraq, before, I mean, a while ago, we got out of ISIS, and then we got out, and then Corona came, and all these problems, I mean, there are fields that we work on, so I said let's keep it short, civil, on sites. Let's make it a little bigger, hahaha, later \r\n\r\n00:10:33 BILAL \r\n. You explained the problem. We are trying to solve it, the ITC is one of the most important goals, what is the house of Bakt, it means yes yes yes they provide job opportunities, they provide job opportunities for young people, so they give training so that young people find work in the market, okay, this is just one part, it is not job opportunities, any thing that we educate them, I mean if we teach them yes interview no no, the opportunities must work to help build green houses, building, or rebuilding green houses so that there is a future, I mean there is the idea of sustainability, internal tax, these two things must come together in training, so every time I go \r\n\r\n00:11:20 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Right. Right. Right \r\n\r\n00:11:24 BILAL \r\n. How, this will help people find an opportunity if we teach them a hobby, things that are behind them in the market, and they said do it cares, what do we do with this certificate? It means we wasted their time in yes, and if they find a job they will just find a job in a bank, right? If they found work somewhere, that means \r\n\r\n00:11:41 LARSA EMAD \r\n, what exactly did we do? \r\n\r\n00:11:44 BILAL, \r\na place that has nothing to do with green building, that means nothing. We don't care, nothing. We did not succeed in training, so these are things that must come together, and we as trainers will focus on people who have the ability, and the knowledge of engineering, India, I mean we do not want to start over, he only has six days, so this framework, the the the the we must put all these things in it, we have six days to work, and with the young men who are teachers and have knowledge, I mean we do not have to start from scratch, we want to find them job opportunities, and we want to find them job opportunities inside the market \r\n\r\n00:12:21 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Nice \r\n\r\n00:12:21 BILAL \r\n. And repeat \r\n\r\n00:12:29 LARSA EMAD . \r\nI just want to inquire about the matter before we complete the six days, this means that we are preparing the curriculum, right? \r\n\r\n00:12:38 BILAL \r\nSix days, the the the the they call it. We want to work with. So if they work, yes, Friday and Saturday, or on the weekend, or at night, they will work for three weeks, two days each week in the end, but I am not sure, meaning that in the end, yes, this is the idea, the framework for us, six days \r\n\r\n00:13:09 LARSA EMAD \r\nThe idea first, and then things will be arranged hahaha \r\n\r\n00:13:12 BILAL \r\n. It will be one day at a time. One day after another, not one day is long. If every week, one day, and it lasts for six weeks, I mean, oh. We will choose later \r\n\r\n00:13:20 LARSA EMAD \r\nWe will see later, and I mean, according to the group that is with us, what will it be? Yes, they will search and restore your affairs? \r\n\r\n00:13:26 BILAL \r\n. Space Mosul Sayes arrived, they are the ones who will be the cornerstone between the Al A youth and the Al A training, so they will do the advertising, they will talk, I mean if they work with you they will talk, and you say Larsa you have time these days we want to try to arrange \r\n\r\n00:13:43 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Right. Right \r\n\r\n00:13:44 BILAL \r\nSo A B we are not going to tell them the details today hahaha. A riot The problem is, the place we work in is the idea of engineering A A. I mean A directions one for insulation, I don't expect, I mean you have enough experience A B with insulation and it is not obvious that you are a designer or a Suez installer, I mean do you have the ability to install A S well? \r\n\r\n00:14:17 LARSA EMAD \r\nAnd this way, houses, I mean, I saw a number of houses, and they told me that they were installed, I mean, these are modern houses, we build them, we put the wall in them, and the system, I mean, for example, let's say this house is 30 amps, yes, and its cost, and these things, I mean, I have a little information about it, but if I can develop myself with it, I mean \r\n\r\n00:14:38 BILAL \r\n, but I mean, if this is in my imagination, and between the way of the interaction with the youth and the model, the curriculum, the training, I expect it will be the best thing, and I will explain to you the subject, how do I imagine it? \r\n\r\n00:14:54 LARSA EMAD \r\nOkay, if you don't mind, I honestly loved all the topics. Yeah, but yeah, I was confused, yeah, he was confused, hahaha. Okay, so I'm flexible . \r\n\r\n00:15:03 BILAL \r\nLet me explain the idea to you, and you tell me. Do you like it or not? Or what do you do? In a different way, okay? So now the idea is that we want to talk about the topic of, yeah, bringing back green houses, but I don't want to start with information from someone sitting in the classroom. Come on, there's green construction using these materials, and these methods. The idea is that we start by going out and exploring the old city and letting them look at all the buildings and go inside Mosul's heritage house, and feel the difference between this house and that house, and take notes, and take pictures. And try to find out all the sustainability issues that they see, right and wrong? The big window house means they just take notes, they take, I mean, if they can, hahaha, a drawing or a picture, that some people might be afraid that some people take pictures of their houses, but hahaha, we think about it, what kind of way can we do it? \r\n\r\n00:16:04 LARSA EMAD \r\nOf course, why not? \r\n\r\n00:16:05 BILAL \r\nBut this idea is that they go and find out all the ways that the houses were working on, that have a, because we don’t use the word sustainability, then we say that which benefits people, and what is it with comfort, whether with privacy, or with all the parties that can benefit people, and then we give them the information, so first we explore, then we give them the information. And then we try to talk. We tell them yes, we will work on, I mean, like a constitution or. So we want criteria through. The information that we have prepared because they are all engineers, and they are all young men, God willing, and they know, and there is a trainer who will be able to help with questions and discussion. I expect that we will come up with good ideas, and then the spirit will start to search and come up with something, and then we will give them a 150 square foot house for a husband and wife and two children in this area in Mosul with these priorities, with all the information and details of the house. And we will do a design competition for them, and how will we deliver this idea of a house? And with the job opportunities, we will work with the engineering gains, and we will tell them that this is the house that you will build, meaning let us work for you, no, you do not have to take the projects that we come up with, but we will give you the details, we will even use them in the lesson, and then come as judges, come, I mean. Look at what people did in training, and say that this house is good, and this house is not good, so there is a relationship between the market and the people who appoint them, and the valves and engineers, and the engineers themselves, and there is a possibility, even a small possibility, that one of these ideas that they do in the training will be implemented even better, if it becomes even better, but this is not the result, the result is that this meeting will take place, and we will start from here, so these parts, my professor, how is your English? Sometimes I overdo it between two languages. \r\n\r\n00:18:44 LARSA EMAD \r\n. It is normal for us to go down. \r\n\r\n00:18:47 BILAL. \r\nWe take from the heritage and take the and take, I mean, all the details, and then we will analyze it and update it. We take from and find out, I mean, why did they use this zero in this way? Huh? I mean, an insulator in the not that we build our walls 6 m? No? \r\n\r\n00:19:04 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Sure \r\n\r\n00:19:05 BILAL \r\n. And then we take these ideas and try to apply them to a real case study coming from the offices. And they make a design competition for us, and we invite a number of winners to go and see the projects, and they make a judgement for them and so on, I mean whoever wins wins, I don't know, morale hahaha, we give a small prize if they manage something for him, then that's it. This idea now \r\n\r\n00:19:32 LARSA EMAD \r\nProfessor Annie, Annie, my question here. This thing is, I mean, can we apply it realistically? I mean, now, what do I want to think about if we come to old houses, for example, they had decorative garden spaces, or they had, for example, let's say roofed windows, I don't know what all these details are, but now we are in new houses, what governs us? The control of space, right? \r\n\r\n00:19:56 BILAL \r\nI, I, I, I, with people? \r\n\r\n00:19:58 LARSA EMAD \r\nAnd it means space engineers, for example, for example, I am an engineer now. As an engineer, for example, a person came to me, yes, a person came to me, his house area is 100 square meters. Okay, where can I leave a garden? This? Of course, he will be left without a garden, but what do we replace it with? For example, we make indoor gardens, small lighthouses, we make all of these paths or a ring, let's just say, I mean that when we talk, I mean, in order for it to be something realistic and logical according to our place \r\n\r\n00:20:29 BILAL \r\nA. A. Of course, I mean. It is necessary. We must take from the old and modernize it if we don't have space for a garden. But I was talking with other architects and engineers and they sent me pictures of small houses, and they took important ideas from Airflow, like how the air gets into the house, and how they can have a garden, even a small one, a garden the size of \r\n\r\n00:20:52 LARSA EMAD \r\n. We do this exactly, a garden even if it's two meters, it's \r\n\r\n00:20:57 BILAL \r\nThese are just two meters, so it's very useful and changes the atmosphere, right? I mean, it brings air, yes, and I mean, it has other things in it, but the idea is that people don't know what the benefit of doing these things is. I mean, they say, why should I take 100 square feet and add two meters of garden from it? But if they go and feel and see the difference between the houses that have it and those that don't, they want it. And then, I mean, there are definitely a lot of things that we won't know the solutions to, so if I see that this training isn't training, it's almost research, because we need to do something different. If you see the way people build in Mosul, they want to take ideas from abroad and apply them here, and build a big oven, a big oven. I mean, a big university, hahaha. The sun is shining and there is no insulation, and I don’t know where the ideas come from, so we need to work on several fronts, and for this reason, the thing you were stuffing about, the training you were doing is very important, because I expect it will be a big part of it because the market is not receptive, these ideas, let’s say we went and said you know what, of course we won’t be able to do all these things, I mean, just take a small garden from these and it doesn’t contradict what we have to do, but even for us and the insulation we have to do it, I am surprised, this is stuffing, and with the people who design and do the insulation, and they say people don’t like it, insulation, they pay $100,000 for the house, and they don’t put $2,000 for the insulation that was lost. Ten years, and reduces the consumption of electricity at home, I mean throughout the year, and returns his money and more, so people need this. In the sector, part of the training must be conviction and the \r\n\r\n00:22:56 LARSA EMAD \r\nrelationship \r\n\r\n00:22:57 BILAL \r\n. And building the relationship \r\n\r\n00:22:58 LARSA EMAD \r\n. I mean, it doesn’t matter to us as an office, when they saw me, they said, you’re not working as a hobby in engineering, but you have the skills to be able to convince and explain the reasons to people. I mean, for example, if we think, let's say, about solar energy, someone comes and says, \"I pay, for example, $1,000 or $2,000 for solar energy,\" but he doesn't think that this is the energy he uses. Let's say the ten-year warranty. In these ten years, if he pays it to the generator, the amounts will be higher. You know, from electricity, our system has more than one problem, which is the national generator. These things, yes. So, a lot of people don't think about this, or for example, they don't think about the long term, like what are the benefits of this topic? In the long run, he only thinks about how much he will spend per day. \r\n\r\n00:23:49 BILAL \r\nSo, convince me. Yes, try to convince me. I have 100 square feet, yes. And you mean you put a garden inside my house, but I mean it's my home? \r\n\r\n00:24:04 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Hahaha, convincing. Aren't you convinced that it's a garden? You want to utilize the space in the best possible way. \r\n\r\n00:24:10 BILAL \r\nBig, because the kids, I don't know what? \r\n\r\n00:24:13 LARSA EMAD \r\nOkay? And are you going to make two floors? Or one floor? \r\n\r\n00:24:16 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes, God willing \r\n\r\n00:24:19 LARSA EMAD \r\nOkay, professor, look, for now, for example, if we, we have no problem, we design for you what suits your needs, but let's think about the long term, for example, right now, or nowadays, we don't have a chance to go out for a hobby except for the atmosphere, the pollution will help, the atmosphere, the whole environment, but if you have, for example, a small fountain at home with a garden and plants, this will give you great psychological comfort. And this will also affect the beauty of the house, it will also affect you, for example, if you sell your house, it won't be like this, it won't have a garden, yeah, you will have a small garden, it's a place to breathe, so maybe this will help you, and we can ask you to design it for you to look at, and God willing, it won't affect your requirements \r\n\r\n00:25:02 BILAL \r\n. Not a single person in my family has a garden at home. None of my jewelers have gardens at home. Why? I took this idea and you're playing with my head. \r\n\r\n00:25:10 LARSA EMAD \r\nYes, you're the one who's going to be the first to do it, right? \r\n\r\n00:25:15 BILAL \r\nI know what you're playing with me, why are you doing it? \r\n\r\n00:25:17 LARSA EMAD \r\nNo, on the contrary, you're going to be the first to do it. You're going to be the first to do it. They're all going to learn from you, and they're going to say this design is the most beautiful, the most modern, and the best for the environment as well. So you can do it in a way that makes you the best among them, and they'll learn to do the same . \r\n\r\n00:25:33 BILAL \r\nEnvironmentally consciously, you're going to increase the price. And reduce the space? What is this? \r\n\r\n00:25:41 LARSA EMAD \r\nWe won't increase the price. Peace be upon you. The price won't increase a lot, because it's like you know a small garden, and we will also do it, I mean, with people within your capabilities, but at the same time, if it decreases, I mean, if the room takes up too much space, we have a second floor, so we can do it, I mean, with it, for example, to compensate for the need that you need . \r\n\r\n00:26:03 BILAL \r\nhas been living here. For a while. But the idea of transforming Erbil after three years, I mean, it will change the price of the house. I mean, I will tell them 100 square feet minus two, so what is the price? For a house, what if it has a garden or not? \r\n\r\n00:26:21 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Look at real estate prices, they are always going up and I don't expect them to go down, so what will you do? Who will you sell the house to? On the contrary, this is an added advantage for your home, that it will have an indoor garden, so that no one will feel that the house is suffocating them and that there is nothing in it. On the contrary, with an indoor garden, they will enjoy it. Even the family who is buying after you, for example. Sure, sure, sure, you can play around and take a look at the subject and ask about it, and we are ready to help you with anything you need. I am convinced even after \r\n\r\n00:27:10 BILAL \r\n. What we need to do, and what I expect to try out, is to delve into the numbers. How much will it cost? What is the difference in cost? When will I get my money back? Yes, the house, before, I mean without a garden and with a garden, we need to see the market. I mean, when a house is sold with the same condition, do we sell a garden? A house of the same size is sold without a garden, is there a difference? \r\n\r\n00:27:30 LARSA EMAD \r\n. I mean, honestly, I don't have much information about this subject, hahaha, and that's why I'm telling you that we can say this in the future hahaha. Yes \r\n\r\n00:27:38 BILAL \r\nYes, because it's still new, meaning there are houses in Mosul. Houses with indoor gardens. Small or not? \r\n\r\n00:27:43 LARSA EMAD \r\nNow, our office used to do indoor gardens as a hobby. For example, a fountain, and plants next to it, that's our hobby. Let me show you, for example, an example that might not show that day when we had it. \r\n\r\n00:28:01 BILAL \r\nHere on Instagram, wow, a fountain is our hobby . \r\n\r\n00:28:04 LARSA EMAD \r\nWhat is this now? Do we really want to recommend it? Is that the case too? And also, ventilation for the house and a nice view? And the sound of the water inside the house, plants? \r\n\r\n00:28:15 BILAL \r\nThis is one house. \r\n\r\n00:28:17 LARSA EMAD \r\nWhat, but what is the gradual way? \r\n\r\n00:28:21 BILAL \r\nSo, did they put it in a place where the hobby is, for the fountain? \r\n\r\n00:28:25 LARSA EMAD \r\n. For example, we can, not according to the area of the house, this house is 200 square meters, not like 100 square meters, I mean, 100 square meters is a little smaller, and the plants, some use artificial plants, I mean, but our goal is to go more natural, I mean, definitely \r\n\r\n00:28:39 BILAL \r\nThat's a good question, I mean, the garden will need it, isn't everything good with the plants, all of them will die? \r\n\r\n00:28:52 LARSA EMAD \r\nNow, you and Abu Al-Mushtar can ask him what are the plants that are resistant? What gives more oxygen to the house, or you can also take the method from him, I mean, he will teach you when to plant them, when to take care of them, and there are many types of them, yes \r\n\r\n00:29:06 BILAL \r\n. And if it has a fountain, there's a possibility we can make it so that it's a system, I mean from \r\n\r\n00:29:11 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Exactly, it's this watering can, so that it's there so that you don't need to water it and it needs to be cleaned every now and then, definitely, it's part of the house cleaning that we do \r\n\r\n00:29:23 BILAL \r\nGood, so far from the six days, I expect there will be at least a full day on the subject of selling, yes, yes, convincing people, yes, because I expect people to come to you, you made me a house with a garden, if you convince them, \r\n\r\n00:29:47 LARSA EMAD \r\nHonestly, what are people like now? There are people who promote videos with houses on TikTok, there are people who search the internet, yes, new models with houses, do you know how? So now, for example, when we approach those who come to us, we tell them this is the latest thing, this is organized, this is nice, so they choose to make an indoor garden at home. I mean, because we care about new models, and our concern as modernity is something modern that \r\n\r\n00:30:14 BILAL \r\nsees, yes, if they are Iraqis or from all over the world. Ideas, I mean, where? \r\n\r\n00:30:22 LARSA EMAD \r\n. I mean, they see it from everywhere. The most common thing now is TikTok and these things. They wait for you to see videos from your country. There are videos that become trends, and they appear next to you, right? \r\n\r\n00:30:33 BILAL \r\n. That's good. And it's good that you put these videos on TikTok and Instagram? \r\n\r\n00:30:39 LARSA EMAD \r\n. We publish on our page, we always publish on it, we do everything, so this topic is honestly our important concern, meaning that our concern is that I can make a video about it and publish it on our page as an awareness for people \r\n\r\n00:30:51 BILAL \r\n. And we can add to it the conviction inside. It's not just the video, a nice fountain. I don't know what, but it's possible. Yes, this house before this house after they followed the obligation, this house \r\n\r\n00:31:02 LARSA EMAD . \r\nDo we do it? \r\n\r\n00:31:05 BILAL \r\n. Fog consumption is cheap this much, even if the price of the house increases now \r\n\r\n00:31:09 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Exactly, this is frankly, why did you say energy? Solar? I don't like it because it means something that is completely related to our reality right now. You know, the situation of electricity right here, so honestly, I also liked the topic of solar energy. I don't know where you guys want to leave me. I mean, solar energy \r\n\r\n00:31:25 BILAL \r\n, a little bit more. It has technical things. We need to delve deeper into it. And not just technical, I mean, electrical information so they can work with electricity. I mean, is there, yes? Hobby information, and if you delve into it, it's difficult, but then there's important manual information that we want them to design and make correctly, to work with it, I mean, needs. We prefer people who \r\n\r\n00:31:58 LARSA EMAD \r\nRight, right? \r\n\r\n00:32:00 BILAL \r\nand know where the problems are sometimes, I mean, fuses are different, if you put the size of the fish, the wires are important in the wire, right? \r\n\r\n00:32:10 LARSA EMAD \r\nRight? Honestly, electricity is a bit complicated. I mean, it's the subject of engineering, electricity, and these things are very complicated. \r\n\r\n00:32:17 BILAL \r\n. Regarding the... regarding the... I mean, you definitely know what you know? I'm one of the things if you think about it, you can work with three, but you do it for the day of conviction, so the trainers give you the... the numbers and the prices and the assumption of selling the house by the house selling teams and behind what might mean the monthly consumption of the house and I don't know, and then you say, come on, let's work together, that you have shown that you can make people move, you can... I mean, you can make rhetoric, you can play, you do this, you take the seller's side, you take this, so in the training that you say, there is a possibility, I mean, but I imagine what I can tell you, certainly in the end the subject is not in my hands, haha, it is possible that you can get in with all the subject of the training that? Day. I mean, you have to know all the information and some of the techniques, just to be convincing. You have this day, so you skip all of them, for example. I expect this. Maybe one of the ways you can present it, I mean, to all of them, if you like them all, skip them all, hahaha, but with this \r\n\r\n00:33:38 LARSA EMAD \r\n. The aspect, I expect that we won't be able to stay in the office, I mean, every day, yes \r\n\r\n00:33:44 BILAL \r\nNo, but this will be, what's its name? I mean, one day with all the training, so there's a possibility that it will be one day a week, which is a period, I mean, not every week, is that our concern? \r\n\r\n00:33:58 LARSA EMAD \r\n. No problem, let's start, let's start seeing, for example, the preparations, these things. And easy later on the rest of the topics \r\n\r\n00:34:05 BILAL \r\n. Okay, so let's think about this, this day we're not thinking about all the training, thinking about this day, yes, if you, if you're riding this day, and for the solar, for the insulation, and for the engineering, what color? How do you arrange it? What do you do at the beginning? Where, I mean? Yes, if you have a day to work on, I mean, conviction, and we call it, I don't know what? From nine to three, and a lunch break and a break \r\n\r\n00:34:37 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Nine with a coffee break \r\n\r\n00:34:41 BILAL \r\n. Five \r\n\r\n00:34:42 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Hours, okay, a coffee break and a lunch break, man, it'll be at least an hour, I mean. And the coffee break is 1/4 hour and 20 minutes, so 4:30 hours, we could say. Okay, now you have to give me an idea, I mean, time for it so I can prepare it, so I can repel ideas \r\n\r\n00:35:09 BILAL \r\n. Hahaha. And I'll come back \r\n\r\n00:35:13 LARSA EMAD \r\n. No. You know I always get hobbies, ideas, for example, that we can start, first of all, for sure so that there is an acquaintance or whatever between all the participants, I will search, I have a wide range of exercises, and all these things are good, after all I live in America, and it will definitely take \r\n\r\n00:35:33 BILAL \r\n. Ee. Ee. I'm not sure, I expect, I don't know, we have to think about it, where do you expect it to be better? The first day, or in the middle, or at the end \r\n\r\n00:35:47 LARSA EMAD \r\n. A representative from the organization, for example, or from the Mosul Space organization, or a person responsible for the project, he will give this introduction about the entire project and come, and then I will go into the details, I mean the contents of today that we will have our agenda \r\n\r\n00:36:04 BILAL \r\n. I think. Maybe. The first day is good, because it gives a framework of things \r\n\r\n00:36:08 LARSA EMAD \r\n. A framework for all the topics that we will talk about \r\n\r\n00:36:13 BILAL \r\nWhen we go with the materials and all the materials that we need? I mean the things that we need to discuss with people, that this will be cheaper, yes, if this will increase the price of the house, and how will he make gifts for the things, then it will be the importance of the things that will make him happy, \r\n\r\n00:36:30 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Right? Of course. I mean, we can say, maybe the voice next to you has become a little bit, if it's normal. I will go to the other room. Ok yeah for example if we started with 9:9 to 9:30, can we have an ice break and get to know each other? Okay, right? Then from 9:30, yes, just 10 minutes to give us the objectives of our session today, which are the. From 9 to 9, 1/2 of this is the. Then from 9. 1/2 to 10, this will be someone from the organization, for example, or from SPICE or from a project, meaning a representative of the home project \r\n\r\n00:37:26 BILAL \r\n. Ee. Ee. Ee. Yes \r\n\r\n00:37:37 LARSA EMAD \r\n. From 10 to 10, 1/2 here we need to do some interaction between the people. Maybe in a role play I give them half and tell them to act this thing out like the second one and you did. Ok, let's do highlights so that later based on them we can build and say, did you see? The response he made, did you see so-and-so? What did he do? The person we build on and explain to the other person that I am not coming with something traditional, I come to explain how to convince? How to do? No, from this simple play that we do for no, then we will take its points and build on them, I mean, did you see how much a certain person was able to convince so-and-so, I mean, for example, did you see what she was wearing? Convince Bilal? I told him I focused on the benefits of this thing. Did you see this? The first thing we will do? Drawing conclusions from it is our concern. We will give them here, we will come to give the information that we want to give, yes \r\n\r\n00:38:40 BILAL \r\n. Yes, from this? Opening the doors and then, I mean, we will fill them in \r\n\r\n00:38:45 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Exactly, this opens the door for example, persuasion and soft skills, then we will come to explain the soft skills, I mean, we will agree on our choreography that we will talk about. For example, let's say from ISIS. This is from ten to ten, half is from ten, half is for ISIS, this will be here, it's like we said we'll talk about what we agreed on. Yes, then we have to do a coffee break there from eleven to one ten, half we'll consider it a coffee break \r\n\r\n00:39:20 BILAL \r\n. It could be soft kilo experiments, go talk with people and try what you learned, and. Honestly. No, no. Finally, God willing. Honestly \r\n\r\n00:39:43 LARSA EMAD \r\n. They go out and smoke. The most important thing is the guys. Of course, the girls drink Nescafe and chat, and the guys don't do anything during the break. But after the break, we can do, for example, we can explain other topics that we have, we combine them, or how do we include these topics of ours in it? It will be something theoretical. Then we make a group. I mean, here, it is possible for half of the group to be from one to two, and half of it will be something intensive. I mean, what subject do we want to give? What do we give it in this hour, for example? Then we make half of it to the unit. Here, there will be a group discussion about the project content, the topic that we will explain. We ask them, for example, for something we can do. Honestly, I will just give you ideas for dividing the time. Here, from one to two, we will have the lunch break. And we will have the last hour to talk about the things we have benefited from, personal experiences. I mean, we can do these things. Or, for example, agreements, if we return to other appointments, I mean, I mean, I just give you something simple, even, then there are definitely other meetings \r\n\r\n00:41:01 BILAL \r\n, meaning, connecting between the doors. We open the doors during the representation. Then we do the ones that we delve into, and then we do what. So, in general, is this correct? Its money and exposure, it means exactly people you know about each other, Icebreakers, we open the doors during this experience, the theatrical play, yes, and then we fill the doors, and then we let people, I mean, try it out inside the practical things, I mean, they are the ones who do the group work, and then? What did we learn? How? This will benefit the goals, that I always, like when we started this talk, I like us to start with the goal, so that when someone thinks about learning how he will deliver this idea, with this idea, right? \r\n\r\n00:41:51 LARSA EMAD \r\nYou know why the goal is important, I mean, even you who enter a place, I've been sitting for two hours and I don't know why they brought me or what the goal of being here is , \r\n\r\n00:42:00 BILAL . \r\nWe can. \r\n\r\n00:42:00 LARSA EMAD \r\n. But you give the goal from the beginning, your material here will be clear that they know the people coming, and they will try to reach this goal and achieve it. \r\n\r\n00:42:09 BILAL \r\n. Okay, and then from this session? We ask them, do you remember our goal for today? I mean, the main goal is to find you job opportunities. \r\n\r\n00:42:17 LARSA EMAD \r\nDo you think we achieved it or reached something from us? \r\n\r\n00:42:21 BILAL \r\nI want to take the green building, this is the big framework goal today, our goal is what color, we will be able to help you, it is that everyone says that this field needs it, it needs it, I mean, an impact on the group, the society, that we can not only go and learn, I mean, isolation, and no one wants isolation, so we must open these fields, so we will teach you so that you will be, I mean, optimistic, we will teach you techniques of conviction, so that you focus on the, focus on the benefits, and then the big goal, the small goal, and then we did it, if not, tell me at the end, if we did it well, if we didn’t do it, let’s try it for an hour, hahaha, this is the last hour here that we do this, we make sure that we connect the goal in the beginning with the goal at the end, and we make sure that it is correct \r\n\r\n00:43:18 LARSA EMAD \r\n. In the end, correct in the end. For his session, we finished, yes, we did the training \r\n\r\n00:43:22 BILAL \r\n. Oh. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:43:26 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Now I'm going to do it. Oh my God. It has nothing to do with bye-bye. Hahaha. Yes \r\n\r\n00:43:28 BILAL \r\n. No, no, but this is expected, meaning that the general money for today’s training, and Hina Anthony’s idea, meaning that today the trainer, there is a possibility that he doesn’t do it every day, that we find the trainer finished with the special thing, for that day, yes, and I expect, okay, if, meaning, if he is more and more convinced that we need a day, and yes, even if it is you or someone else, but we need to do it because the technical people who are with them, they can tell me to read you all the details, they know electronics engineering, they do I don’t know what, but yes, they don’t always know, you mean, they interact a little with people and how they convince people, how are the people who say that he finds it difficult to convince people to use it correctly, he says that maybe you are more technical and not humane, meaning you focus on numbers and not on lives, so we need him to get angry, people to rely on both, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:44:28 LARSA EMAD \r\n. No, it always means you, currently they want to focus on these things like Instagram, you sell the need and not the idea, I mean we sell, for example, that I think what he needs and connects it to it. And we connect it to the moments of this house, I mean when you live with your family, there is a nice atmosphere, organized moments, and you sit here, I mean, drinking a cup of Nescafe, it will be more connected to the mind \r\n\r\n00:44:56 BILAL \r\nI expect. There is something not at all, I mean someone will be happy to say it, but if we tell them when you take pictures in the house and put them on Instagram, if it has a garden it will be nicer. It will come up with something you want to share, I mean they have to say this, where? Is this house in Europe? No. I mean we can show them these houses, if you have any picture of a house, I mean a finished design, I mean a real one, not a model, a house of the people of Mosul, which is nice, we can put it in the training, and we tell them, like let's make a game, where is this house? They are trying to get there, but it's not Baghdad, that is, far away. And then, if you love it, we can use fascism, like people can make two phone calls, take a QR code, and say I liked this, I didn't like that. And then we can expect them to tell us that they loved the houses in Mosul that have these things, and these things are not just a form, they are not just a pretty form in pictures, but they have depth. You see all the houses, the heritage, how beautiful they are, but this beauty is not only external, it is internal, it has meaning, meaning, depth, and benefit. This is something if we can think about how we can connect all these things, even people, I mean, where are they from now? People, sometimes they like the same pictures, Instagram pictures and not Instagram, but we tell them these pictures, Instagram is nice, but you know what's more important than this, this benefit and this depth, and this important meaning, and not only that, and this, God willing, connects us to our history, the Musalawis, and the identity \r\n\r\n00:46:45 LARSA EMAD \r\n. I mean, our concern, for example, what can we start with, like we said in the beginning? Or for example, we can say yes, if you were given the choice to live in this house, for example, it turns out that it's just a building without a, let's say a garden or something, and another house that has more enjoyable things, we will ask them if you were given the choice where would you like to live? Surely the majority would want to live in the place which is the green house, let's say or not? Yes \r\n\r\n00:47:47 BILAL \r\n. At the same time, it's the best thing we can give them, the answers they need \r\n\r\n00:47:51 LARSA EMAD \r\n. They have to let me solve them \r\n\r\n00:47:53 BILAL \r\n. They can't solve them on their own. And then in the end, we give them the answers \r\n\r\n00:47:57 LARSA EMAD \r\n. It. It's this \r\n\r\n00:48:02 BILAL \r\nWhat? Right? Right. I think we have to go to the L-L and tell them this is Mo-T or this is T-T, but so that you understand the difference between them \r\n\r\n00:48:16 LARSA EMAD \r\nAh \r\n\r\n00:48:25 BILAL \r\nI like, I mean, I don't know if you saw during this L-L the idea, I tried to make it you, you organize the ideas and uh? Ya, and this way people learn and understand more, and it will be the most interactive one for whom, I mean, now you've organized the \r\n\r\n00:48:43 LARSA EMAD \r\nThe idea is for them to be attracted to you so that they don't get bored and fall asleep in the middle of the workshop, right? \r\n\r\n00:48:51 BILAL \r\nOkay, I expect this is a good start and you've opened a whole new field, as long as the role of the trainer in general, but we're also looking for trainers with things like the 00:48:51 BILAL This means now I have to go and change all the other trainings and add a day, I have to joke about things and free up a whole day, so that we have a day that you expect is the best cream for it, if conviction or what do you call this first day? \r\n\r\n00:49:22 LARSA EMAD \r\nThe voice is gone, what is the voice gone? What do you call it? \r\n\r\n00:49:25 BILAL \r\nThis day? If it's the first day, what do you call it? The goals that we talked about? \r\n\r\n00:49:33 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Let's look for them, for example. We can't call it soft skills alone, and I don't want to call it that, I mean, I want to link it to engineering . \r\n\r\n00:49:44 BILAL \r\n. Yes. So \r\n\r\n00:49:46 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Could it be engineering, engineering soft skills, or engineer soft skills? I mean, we'll look for and agree on them later . \r\n\r\n00:50:03 BILAL \r\n. No. \r\n\r\n00:50:10 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Yes, let's look for something more realistic. \r\n\r\n00:50:13 BILAL \r\n. Yes, and the problem is that there are people here who might look for training on building green spaces and say they will learn something and it won't be beneficial, because people don't want it. \r\n\r\n00:50:27 LARSA EMAD \r\n. I mean, we don't call it, they'll say no, we know, we're capable, we're just that everything related to engineering, let it be something professional, \r\n\r\n00:50:39 BILAL \r\n. It's a word, and this is one of the things, but I don't know if it's convincing, it's good, I mean, sales \r\n\r\n00:50:47 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Ok, have it , \r\n\r\n00:50:50 BILAL \r\n. It means that there is one engineer, that they will all be engineers, but they need to know the numbers. At least 50% focus on it, and 50% of the other two focus on the people \r\n\r\n00:51:05 LARSA EMAD \r\nwho are there, will they be engineering students or graduate engineers? \r\n\r\n00:51:10 BILAL \r\n. It's supposed to mean? If we even think, we don't have to start from the beginning, graduates \r\n\r\n00:51:16 LARSA EMAD \r\nOk? \r\n\r\n00:51:17 BILAL \r\n. So that we can appreciate that we don't have time for a hobby with them, so if we go to electricity, what do I know? What does it mean for a long time, so we must be able to say \r\n\r\n00:51:25 LARSA EMAD \r\n. If we say not graduates, they will come to us even in the first stage and those who don't know anything about engineering, for example \r\n\r\n00:51:30 BILAL \r\n. Right. No, we must start, I mean, with graduates and. And above. But they will find themselves entering a new field, the field of green construction, and green reconstruction, God willing \r\n\r\n00:51:39 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Green buildings, yes \r\n\r\n00:51:41 BILAL \r\n. Seconds, I always try when I fill in, and with people, I tell them think about Mosul two hundred years ago, all the buildings were sustainable green buildings, because there was no electricity, so exactly we must go back, I mean, at least learn how they were building and. I mean, we take, I mean, A. Knowledge and be proud of our history. And this will be the best way to build here because it will be from the country. And materials from the country are probably from her country. \r\n\r\n00:52:10 LARSA EMAD \r\nThere is another topic, too. If we take a look at it, which is the skylight. Now, what do we do with houses? It's good, caves. You don't have space to do it from behind, or you can't take your space. For lighting and ventilation, for these things, having a skylight is also a good thing. So, we combine the skylight with the internal garden. What does it mean? Is there an opening exactly like the youth homes, but in the ceiling? \r\n\r\n00:52:41 BILAL \r\n. Closed, meaning insulated \r\n\r\n. 00:52:44 LARSA EMAD \r\nWhat does it mean, at the university? Are there people who do it? It's possible, of course, that in the future, smart homes will open and close. Of course? \r\n\r\n00:52:53 BILAL \r\nHey hey it would be a really nice thing, but I mean one of the things I'm stuck with, and with the insulation people is that they want to put insulation on the entire roof, so yeah, if the old houses were a garden, and the skylight was open as you know, we won't solve all these problems, like I told you, I expect the training will be like research, we have to find the preferred solutions and do them, I mean we go \r\n\r\n00:53:21 LARSA EMAD \r\n. We get to know, I mean we definitely have to give and with people we ask about the houses, one useful house or another, or their personal experience so we can arrive at a specific solution \r\n\r\n00:53:31 BILAL \r\nOn the aa this is an idea, the. But I want to know the the the the the the the the the the percentage of insulation protects the house more, if it means it means it is useful in the winter, if you bring the I mean a lot of details? \r\n\r\n00:53:45 LARSA EMAD \r\nThe university owns it, it's definitely an insulator, yeah, yeah, I mean it's definitely so that it doesn't give off extra heat to the house yeah, and it's not in large spaces, I mean it's like let's say the glass that's on the window yeah, so it's almost the same idea \r\n\r\n00:53:59 BILAL \r\nGood, good, okay, yeah, I had one of the things that's not at all like this, I see a lot of people who think about it is the wind. How does the wind get in and out of the building, do you buy it based on this or not? \r\n\r\n00:54:16 LARSA EMAD \r\nWe definitely take into consideration the design of the windows, for example, in the house, that every room must have ventilation. Yes, like I told you, for example, now these internal gardens are like a corridor. We can open the window to the garden, so there is ventilation in the house. So all of these things are taken into consideration, even if it is not a hobby we talk about, but we do it. \r\n\r\n00:54:34 BILAL \r\nOkay. Because we also have to think about the wind and the direction, not the usual winds coming from where and how the building is, but this will be in the architecture, but so that you can see if you travel with it until now, it is the if you use it, it is my library of urban engineering . \r\n\r\n00:54:56 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Engineering. \r\n\r\n00:54:57 BILAL \r\n. Yes, when people come to you, they decide to find a house, and what do they have? I mean, when do they bring something to those who come to you? The details they bring with them \r\n\r\n00:55:07 LARSA EMAD \r\n. They mean, let's say, the engineer who will design it, and the management we have, we definitely have a consulting engineer, Mr. Ihsan is here, you might also meet him in the coming days, because he, they, they gave us his name as a consultant. We have Mr. Abu Yazan. We care that he is the one who, let's say, as a civilian, he is the one who takes over. But when people come to us, we ask them about their needs, the area of the house, how many rooms they want, and then we start suggesting new ideas and things. I mean, \r\n\r\n00:55:41 BILAL \r\nand the other offices don't do it? Why do you torture yourselves? \r\n\r\n00:55:48 LARSA EMAD \r\n. So that we can do something unique and new, and that is beneficial to the environment? Of course, I mean \r\n\r\n00:55:52 BILAL \r\n. Good, good, yeah. And people know you because you work on new things, and you have a reputation \r\n\r\n00:56:00 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Of course, to be honest, I don't know, like the rest of the offices, but I expect that the rest of the offices, there are some of them who work on this system, I mean, thank God, but I don't know how many percent, I mean, I can't tell you that 10% of them work or 20%, I don't know, I expect that \r\n\r\n00:56:15 BILAL \r\nwe need to bring people from the offices. We let them in with the training that we do and we encourage them with the idea that it's not only that their reputation is better, but that they benefit people more, I mean, someone comes and brings it home and does it, \r\n\r\n00:56:29 LARSA EMAD \r\n. I mean \r\n\r\n00:56:30 BILAL \r\n. Fair work, and people want to fill the technical people \r\n\r\n00:56:32 LARSA EMAD \r\nexactly, and then? \r\n\r\n00:56:33 BILAL \r\n. More work, so if someone visits, it means \r\n\r\n00:56:35 LARSA EMAD \r\nthat I always, I always do anything, even if it's simple, I mean, I also do some handicrafts and stuff, right? \r\n\r\n00:56:43 BILAL \r\nNice. Um. Um, right? \r\n\r\n00:56:58 LARSA EMAD \r\n. The student is in engineering. Not just Dr. B. I mean, let's say the lives of individual citizens. I mean, as they say, our concern as engineers is that we must think about what the person will benefit from, not just the material benefit that we will definitely take. Because if this person benefits, if his house benefits, it will come in the way he needs, in the way that benefits him. I mean, he will definitely say other people. He is the one who will advertise for us without us advertising for ourselves, exactly. Right. Right \r\n\r\n00:57:45 BILAL \r\nI have a call. I'm coming in a little while. Okay. In July, I think July 19th, I'm coming to Mosul and God willing, I will go, I will have a salary of \r\n\r\n00:57:59 LARSA EMAD \r\nBut my question is, what were you going to do? \r\n\r\n00:58:03 BILAL \r\nYes, I'll tell you the schedule in a little while. I'm coming July 19th, yes, and we're going to have a session with what we call the yes? It will be a complement to the complement to the designs, for the training, and we will work with the saplings so that they take it and do it for themselves. I mean, I don’t want to give them the design and say, “Come on, implement it,” like we did. No, they have to implement it the right way? \r\n\r\n00:58:30 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Right? They are the ones who do it and apply it, yes \r\n\r\n00:58:32 BILAL \r\n. In this training, the saplings study the result of it, that they have slides, and I mean, of course \r\n\r\n00:58:40 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Of course \r\n\r\n00:58:42 BILAL \r\ntheirs. And then we choose from these people who will come to this ll ll ll ll. A from them. They are presenting the project, so I will take all the information and all the interviews and the details, my dear. I have to ask you this question, did you say you put, I mean put, have you done trainings before, what? How many do you start? Yes, you do them, how many trainings have you done? I mean, I am a number, I mean, not? \r\n\r\n00:59:09 LARSA EMAD \r\n. It is necessary exactly, I mean, don't you see, we mean, in my last job, before that, I used to do, for example, meetings, yes, I mean, even if it wasn't a large-scale training, right? No, before it was my hobby, not every job is different, the type of training, since I was yesterday, I founded a psychological and social care provider, we used to do courses on care, trauma, conflict, all of these things, I did training on them, I mean, every day we had training, I did maybe 2030 trainings, okay, for three days, the training was for children and women, yes, and I did trainings for young people as a hobby, yes. We were working, I wasn't a project officer at the end of the day, I was a project officer, I was responsible for them, the youth ambassadors, the youth ambassadors who would conduct trainings for young people and teenagers, but I would conduct training for them, they would also train, we made it a hobby \r\n\r\n01:00:11 BILAL \r\n. Good \r\n\r\n01:00:13 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n01:00:13 BILAL \r\nGood? \r\n\r\n01:00:14 LARSA EMAD \r\n. I mean, and we worked on curricula as well, I mean we leave the curricula, yes let's say we train on them among ourselves, we as yes later we give it to the youth ambassadors and we will encourage them on it well \r\n\r\n01:00:30 BILAL \r\n. God willing \r\n\r\n01:00:30 LARSA EMAD \r\n. I mean as facilitation positions? Right? Ah \r\n\r\n01:01:15 BILAL \r\n. Ah, we brought five people for the trainers. I don't know how many they will find in Mosul. We will determine the number, the people we want, the number of trainers we need. So my job is to present it there, and then it will be in the hands of the Mosul Space to choose and organize the arrangement of the days, and the people who will work with them. So I will arrange the information. And I will meet with you. And then you and Mosul Space will present the project, God willing. This idea \r\n\r\n01:01:48 LARSA EMAD . \r\nWhat do you mean? \r\n\r\n01:01:49 BILAL \r\n. But it will start in August or after that \r\n\r\n01:01:54 LARSA EMAD \r\n. It's better until the heat ends here in Iraq. Hahaha \r\n\r\n01:01:57 BILAL \r\n. Yes, right, if we go again, I'm in the old city, we have to do it in September, or after that \r\n\r\n01:02:04 LARSA EMAD \r\nHahaha, yes, right. Yes. By God willing, I'm ready whenever you need me. And God willing, we'll agree on something nice. But I'm just asking, is the project Valentine's Day or what? Hahaha, this? \r\n\r\n01:02:19 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes, but yes, I don't know the number, I'm not sure of the daily number, but a little bit \r\n\r\n01:02:24 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Okay \r\n\r\n01:02:25 BILAL \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n01:02:28 LARSA EMAD \r\n. No problem, I mean, what's important is that it's something that covers, because honestly, I'm not from inside Mosul, I have transportation and so on \r\n\r\n01:02:36 BILAL \r\n. But the good thing about this project for you, if I see it, is that it's part of your direction where you take what you've learned and the capabilities and all these things and start \r\n\r\n01:02:47 LARSA EMAD \r\n. I want to balance between organizations and engineering \r\n\r\n01:02:49 BILAL \r\n. Yes. And \r\n\r\n01:02:51 LARSA EMAD \r\nyou're going to choose? \r\n\r\n01:02:51 BILAL \r\nexactly a hobby and you don't know what doors will open in there? \r\n\r\n01:02:55 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Possibilities? No, no, I really like the project. I mean, I have a problem with anything, I mean. Even if it's volunteering, because like I told you, when they told me about it, I said, okay, here it is, God willing. This thing is necessary \r\n\r\n01:03:08 BILAL \r\n. I like that we do the. I mean, we have to fill it in Arabic. I don't know what to say in Arabic, but yes, today it will be \r\n\r\n01:03:18 LARSA EMAD . \r\nSo, how do you market yourself as an engineer? Or how do you market? \r\n\r\n01:03:22 BILAL \r\nfor? \r\n\r\n01:03:24 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Engineering does \r\n\r\n01:03:25 BILAL \r\nthe. the. I mean, you go and see the house, you take the numbers and you say, no, this house needs these panels, and it will save you this much money, and it will benefit you in this way and be convincing. So, he has to know yyy, I mean, interpret the reality and know how much the application will provide, and then convince people on the application. He doesn't need to know the depth, like the engineer who will go with the numbers and decide the leads and loved ones. How can he not? \r\n\r\n01:03:57 LARSA EMAD \r\n. He doesn't need? I mean, let's just say the thing, let's talk about it \r\n\r\n01:04:01 BILAL \r\n. He needs to know some techniques to say, this isn't 10 amps, you need 5, because in the summer, what does he need? He needs to know information \r\n\r\n01:04:10 LARSA EMAD \r\n. I want you to understand \r\n\r\n01:04:10 BILAL \r\n. Yes, and they will be able to be convincing, because this is the idea of the engineer, he is an engineer, but he does the first engineering to sell the idea, and then design \r\n\r\n01:04:27 LARSA EMAD \r\nYes, yes, good, nice job, thank you for the explanation. And, I mean, why was it fruitful? \r\n\r\n01:04:35 BILAL \r\nI liked our play and I expect that there will be another theater in the future, God willing hahaha \r\n\r\n01:04:44 LARSA EMAD \r\nGod willing, God willing we will meet, thank you very much and I am ready, I mean my email is available today and my phone number is also available, yes yes \r\n\r\n01:04:51 BILAL \r\nI want to see your Instagram and TikTok, are you starting to make me think that it needs to be? \r\n\r\n01:04:57 LARSA EMAD \r\n. Currently we don't have TikTok, we have Facebook, we have Facebook and Instagram page, yes I can share with you that \r\n\r\n01:05:04 BILAL \r\n. This is important, where do you like to do it? That? They see us on Instagram and TikTok, we need to put the environment and sustainability and the... the... I mean, the low consumption and the cost, the benefit of which is on Instagram and TikTok, and they spent, I mean, people have to see it and know \r\n\r\n01:05:22 LARSA EMAD \r\n. In video mode, I mean, can we make a video about the system, what is its benefit at home? This thing came to my mind now, I will do it, God willing, I will work on you \r\n\r\n01:05:31 BILAL \r\n. Since they sold this, it is a good thing, they sold this as something for sustainability \r\n\r\n01:05:35 LARSA EMAD \r\n. No, no, no, of course we are efficient if we focus on what is the benefit and the cost as well, I mean, what is in the future? What will he be shocked by? Hello, thank you very much, God willing, bye, Hala"

Have you heard about the project, from the house before? Should I start from the beginning ? \r\n\r\n00:01:49 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nNo, have you heard about the project? Are there any like their colleagues who participated? \r\n\r\n00:01:55 BILAL \r\n. In the project before. Okay, so let's just get to know each other a little bit. You'll see that I, Bilal, was born outside Iraq. My parents went out to study and we were imprisoned. I grew up in America, so if you see my Arabic is weak, that's why . \r\n\r\n00:02:14 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nNo problem, right? \r\n\r\n00:02:15 BILAL \r\n. But first of all, I'm proud that he can work in Iraq, and I would love for him to speak Arabic, so I'll stay there as long as he can, and I'm an advisor with the United Nations, and their goal in this matter is twofold, the main, major goal. It is, it is, people employ them, and it means they create job opportunities with this project from home, they want to do it with, I mean, the, the, the private sector, the, the green home sector, and it is specifically connected, I mean, there is a housing crisis, the number of housing units, and a crisis in the nature of housing, yes, by the percentage of, yes, the, the, the, the, the sustainable ideas, and the consumption of oil, electricity, heat, and insulation, all of this in this area that we are trying to work between the two, so that people find jobs, and at the same time, there are, I mean, better houses in the market, I mean, we in my area want to focus on, and my job is to stuff, with nice people like you, and learn as much as you can from them, and organize any training to help graduates, people, I mean, engineers, if you mean, electrical engineers, if you mean architects, if you mean graduates, to find job opportunities. By adding new information and capabilities within the registrations of architecture installation, solar, and these three. So if you want to know now, let's get to know the framework in general. The goal of this call is to learn from you, I expect about the idea of how we can organize the training and what you suggest, and the second thing is to see if you have a plan, and if you are willing to be with us as a trainer, these two things will be at the end of the conversation, God willing. I mean, let's take things easy and see. Yes, these two topics. And if you want to tell us a little bit about yourself, it will be very forbidden, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:04:32 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nOkay. I am someone like myself, a thief and an architect who graduated in 2017. Then I got a master's degree in A, meaning the same topic as A, meaning renewable energy, but what do we want, the envelopes of contemporary buildings? Yes, I mean the outer shell of the building, yes, what are the parameters? Even if, for example, there is hair on the screen, it is possible \r\n\r\n. 00:04:54 BILAL \r\n. Yes, please, I expect, you can, if you have the ability to share the screen, I'm not sure. I expect yes. Yes, please. \r\n\r\n00:05:06 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. For example, I'm clear on the screen now . \r\n\r\n00:05:09 BILAL \r\n. Yes, it's clear. I see myself four times. \r\n\r\n00:05:14 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Oh, like, oh, I worked on Grace Cover, so, if for example . \r\n\r\n00:05:18 BILAL . \r\nWait a minute, oh, just to see, I mean, what \r\n\r\n00:05:20 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\ndo you have an idea about? \r\n\r\n00:05:21 BILAL \r\n. Just to see the dead, what do I see? Oh, anything else. I expect you should participate. \r\n\r\n00:05:28 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Okay \r\n\r\n. 00:05:29 BILAL \r\n. Again, share again, and the dossier means a page, does that mean something else? And you are in Mosul now \r\n\r\n00:05:42 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Yes, in Mosul \r\n\r\n00:05:43 BILAL \r\nHow are you today? Is it done? Spring has become summer? \r\n\r\n00:05:48 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThe summer has become very hot hahaha, but I don't know if I am allowed to share, I don't know why? \r\n\r\n00:05:53 BILAL \r\n. No, you shared the first time, yes, but I think it is necessary \r\n\r\n00:05:56 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nWho shared? I mean, all over the screen with me? \r\n\r\n00:05:59 BILAL \r\n. Oh, that's strange. Try on Windows, after we saw the Windows tab \r\n\r\n00:06:09 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nDidn't you engage me? Now? \r\n\r\n00:06:14 BILAL \r\n. Yes, let's see where we've reached? No, not yet. Yes, let's see the rest of the screen, the media player. Oh, wow, this. \r\n\r\n00:06:25 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Hi, grassrooper, this is a project that was released from my graduation. It was the most famous. I study the majority of buildings that are separate from the building, I mean, completely, I mean, it's the outer shell of the building, and this outer shell is what protects the building from the energy of the sun, and the. The temperature, and even the wind times, the wind, I mean, God willing. So this is part of the work with the algorithms that I built. \r\n\r\n00:06:53 BILAL \r\nIt's very nice, this is very nice, but this idea that there's not a whole house, what color does the sun get in through it, I mean? This is what are the materials, the wow \r\n\r\n00:07:02 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThe materials are all of them, like what Colstyle M means materials, meaning both are external crusts, and we can do a simulation on the side that gets more sun, for example \r\n\r\n00:07:17 BILAL \r\n. And \r\n\r\n00:07:17 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n, so I am like A from the works of A. And we give him the like, exactly the location of the house M. And how much A. The sun that comes in on us is good. It is possible for me to increase, for example, the thickness in a certain place, meaning it covers it more, and it is possible for it to be exposed from the side of the shade, meaning that \r\n\r\n00:07:35 BILAL \r\n. It comes in, yes, good, good, so it means, smart, smart, cover \r\n\r\n00:07:42 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Yes, yes, come down, exactly \r\n\r\n00:07:44 BILAL \r\n. Nice \r\n\r\n00:07:45 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nSo, it's possible that I can change the shapes of A by changing the parameters, I mean, it's simple, like when I change it, right, when we build it, it's a bit complicated, but in the end, for example, this, for example, I consider it, for example, the sun, yeah, so I move this A line of mine in a place where there's a lot of sun, for example, it's more blocked \r\n\r\n00:08:08 BILAL \r\nIs that good? \r\n\r\n00:08:09 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Or, for example, if it was bigger. And exactly the same thing with the rest of the examples, if, for example, I can even control its shape so that it's, yeah, beautiful, and with it, that it benefits from the sun, meaning that it's protected by the house from the sun or any mass, meaning it doesn't have to be a house, a building, or anything \r\n\r\n00:08:29 BILAL \r\nThis is one of the things, I really like this because it's one of the basic ideas that I want to share, and oh, and people in training that. A. We must learn from the past. We will be the future. So, I mean, \r\n\r\nif I \r\n\r\nsee inside \r\n\r\nthe \r\n\r\n, \r\nthe \r\n, the , this \r\n... \r\nAnd it's possible, of course, you did it, I mean, modeling for the transfer? \r\n\r\n00:09:32 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nDid you do modeling for the piece that is this Islamic piece a little while ago , I mean \r\n\r\n00:09:36 BILAL \r\n? \r\n\r\n00:09:37 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI saw it. You made it a 3D model, and I mean, they are names. When the 100 ends, I'll send you a message with a picture of my device, I mean, you made a real device for it . \r\n\r\n00:09:47 BILAL \r\n. Oh man, oh man. You made it real. Look at the example \r\n\r\n00:09:52 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Which means what resembles \r\n\r\n00:09:54 BILAL \r\nWhat is this, what? \r\n\r\n00:09:56 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nJust a moment, let me show you this same shape \r\n\r\n00:10:00 BILAL \r\n. This thing enlarged it, the 3D model enlarged it, I mean when you printed it \r\n\r\n00:10:07 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\napproximately 60 by 60, 60 by 70 or 60 by 40, I don’t remember exactly, but now I’ll take a picture for you, I have video pictures of it and I’m playing it, so it’s sensitive to the sensor, I mean. The building, so I have sensors, so I worked with the mechanic, he is a mechanic, he installs these sensors for me so that when the sun's energy comes, whenever it is strong in this place, it will automatically close, and then when the sun's energy decreases in this direction, yeah, it will open again on its own, meaning without the intervention of a human hand, meaning everything will happen \r\n\r\n00:10:49 BILAL \r\nSomething very nice \r\n\r\n00:10:50 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nand it is possible that yes, it is possible that they make it automatic using wheels, meaning yes, it is manual, for example, so that \r\n\r\n00:11:01 BILAL \r\nthey go out \r\n\r\n00:11:02 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Yes, the same chronic cold. Yes, nice \r\n\r\n00:11:04 BILAL \r\n. Oh, and \r\n\r\n00:11:05 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Yes, we are the only ones who made and approved it, meaning it is sensitive to the temperature, meaning it reads a certain temperature and shuts down, better \r\n\r\n00:11:14 BILAL \r\n. A. I want to see, meaning, if this will be applied practically, do you expect that there will be, meaning, one will have sensors and a motor, and mechanical things, there is a possibility, meaning, it is complicated and expensive, or one, the simplest thing that has more. Meaning, it will be more effective than the if you installed it on a house \r\n\r\n00:11:40 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nYes, for example, this is just me seeing its shape, yes, for example? \r\n\r\n00:11:44 BILAL \r\n. This \r\n\r\n00:11:45 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nmeans that we can make this a simulation and yes, it means that we can control the size of the rose or any shape of the element that the customer likes, for example, and for example we make a pattern of everything, meaning that it is blocked or closed in a place where the sun is strong and little by little it opens up or becomes lighter than the place where it enters, for example, it is in, or it does not enter to drink even if this \r\n\r\n00:12:11 BILAL \r\n. Like, \r\n\r\n00:12:11 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. 00:12:13 BILAL Modern natural \r\nlighting \r\n\r\n, mashrabiya, using the modern methods of the modeling, it's almost like a mashrabiya, but not every house has the same mashrabiya. It's on the corner with the sun. You choose the one that best suits it so that it's more effective as an insulator, God willing. So, this is a great idea. \r\n\r\n00:12:42 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Exactly? And even the pattern, I mean the decoration, we can redesign it according to the customer's taste. I mean, I haven't seen it always be the same in every house. I mean, every house has the same pattern. I mean, even if one wants to be unique, or each person has his own. \r\n\r\n00:13:01 BILAL \r\nI really liked this. And you're applying for the project. I know you've finished your master's degree, but what happened with this project? What are you going to do with it? It's a great idea. \r\n\r\n00:13:11 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Honestly, I mean, it doesn't mean, it doesn't mean at all. I mean, if I'm frustrated after I finished it, especially since I worked on it on the device in Tunisia, I mean, 3D video, and I presented it and shared it in a festival, and this \r\n\r\n00:13:22 BILAL \r\nIf no one is morally supportive of me now, this needs someone to take it step by step, a step to the future, God willing, and if you've tried doing something like this, there's something called Shabat Law Laser Care, I mean, 3D printing is something, but the second way might be more accurate and cheaper for a young man to do it on \r\n\r\n00:13:52 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI was interested in it, right? No, I tried it, like I said, the most difficult thing I chose was for it to be 3D and sensitive, what exactly, based on the fact that the rest is simple, I can do it, I mean, whenever I can, I can come, I mean, use it, I hear it, like I said, I just need a 3D printer, laser cutter, and it gives you, for example, what's missing from your engraving? \r\n\r\n00:14:16 BILAL \r\nA room in the house? I mean, does your room have a window? \r\n\r\n00:14:18 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Even if it's made of any material I need, I mean \r\n\r\n00:14:20 BILAL \r\nDon't apply it. Go apply it. And even people say, what's this strange thing? \r\n\r\n00:14:25 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nWho? \r\n\r\n00:14:25 BILAL \r\n. The flowers are just a window, I don't know what, so there's going to be a discussion, I mean. But it's encouraging that they are progressing in this subject, but what we see and with all the interviews that I do, and people, I mean, with the insulation, with the mortar, with the mortar, but with the insulation and with the mortar, yes, the architects, the engineers, they say that people who do not have a culture of insulation do not want it. Basically, even if the cost is simple for a building, maybe $100,000, they add $2,000 for insulation and it benefits them for ten years or more and they recoup their money in two years and they say, \"What? Let's install the split system and the air conditioning and that's it.\" \r\n\r\n00:15:13 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. But, I mean, no. We were not for the world, frankly. No, no, we were not for the world. I do not work in the private sector. I mean, I design, I mean, I implement houses, and that's it. I mean, I miss the work, I mean, I mean, there are everything, I mean, customers that they need these insulating materials, especially if their homes are known for, for example, facing the sunrise or their home will always be exposed to the sun, so they allow me to use these materials, on the contrary, they encourage me to use these materials, honestly, I mean, for example, they really like Thermostone, especially if it's on the front facade, because for example, the sunrise and... and the facade has very strong sun in front of it, so before, for example, they tell me I want to use an insulating material, I mean, don't let us, for example, not use it, for example, there are bricks, this \r\n\r\n00:16:03 BILAL \r\n. I mean \r\n\r\n00:16:05 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Is Thermostone available? Yes, for example, if we use it and put supporting columns because it's not used, I mean, it can't bear the weight during \r\n\r\n00:16:13 BILAL \r\n. Heavy \r\n\r\n00:16:13 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Exactly, when it comes to EE, I mean, we advise him about the house, to tell him, for example, if you allow us to use columns and use something like a level, they accept, I mean, they agree normally, and even the materials that are like these additional materials that, for example, like we leave them as plaster or they are, for example, I don’t remember their exact name, but that they are placed on the walls, I mean, yes, for example, as plaster and they are important for the heat, many of their houses use it except for the roof, I mean, honestly, yes, a large percentage of people use wall insulation, not the roof, I mean the roof of the house, because most of them use a layer of individual, and a layer like bitumen or this, and then they put cash and sometimes even, for example, they line up a block and then they go back and put the block horizon again, the stories even just on the extension, so that the heat does not pass through the ceiling with the roof \r\n\r\n00:17:05 BILAL \r\nI mean, no, really, I mean, you are stuffing a story that is completely different from the people that I talk to in the rest of the private sector, yes, the company that you are taking with, what is its name? Because there is a possibility that she is known for her, I mean, the idea \r\n\r\n00:17:19 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI work, I mean, in my name, I mean, on my own. Yes, I used to work before with Amir Engineering and Construction \r\n\r\n00:17:27 BILAL \r\nYes, so you mean, you have a small company, I mean, online \r\n\r\n00:17:33 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Hahaha online \r\n\r\n00:17:34 BILAL \r\nExactly, do you have a website? Do you have an Instagram account? Where? Where do people ask you? \r\n\r\n00:17:39 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nCurrently, currently, but I mean, I am in private contact with you, and now I am getting ready to open an office for myself, but I need a little time \r\n\r\n00:17:46 BILAL \r\nHahaha God willing, God willing, because \r\n\r\n00:17:48 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI don't have a full baguette. Yes, exactly? \r\n\r\n00:17:51 BILAL \r\nBut yeah, how many houses, how many houses have you designed? Yeah, so far. Yeah, yeah, with the title of ideas? \r\n\r\n00:17:59 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI mean, a lot. I mean, I graduated in 2017, and does anyone have a lot of houses now? Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:18:05 BILAL \r\n. I mean, ten or 50. \r\n\r\n00:18:08 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. No, not ten, impossible, yeah, sure. 50 or more. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:18:11 BILAL \r\n. Wow. And what? How many houses out of these 50 do you expect? The customer was thinking about insulation and reducing oil consumption. \r\n\r\n00:18:19 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. And electricity, I mean, me. For example, if. If we come to the roof, it's all done, I mean, it's all done. They want insulation for the sound, for the house, I mean, a private roof, if. I mean, no one would build without using these insulators on the roof. Why would he know that the heat will come first thing in the morning? Why? I mean, even if, for example, he can't afford the cost of the rest of the things, but the key is, like a foregone conclusion, he must work . \r\n\r\n00:18:49 BILAL \r\nFocus on the roof. What does that mean for you? For you and... I mean, practical experiments in the market? And practical experiments in the market, I mean, in real houses? What is the cheapest thing that has the most benefit? Isn't it the cheapest? The cheapest. I mean, the appropriate price that means, if someone is going to build a house, he must at least do it with a roof, because it has the most benefit in terms of insulation. What kind of roof do you encourage people to see? \r\n\r\n00:19:19 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. What, for example? I mean, I'll ask him more than that, but for example, if I have a bit of a big budget, and for example, they can use isokane with us and cork or tile, or for example, if they don't have that possibility, they can put just a layer with cork and bitumen, and then they go back and make tile, I mean, the customer, I mean, all customers need to. They need to make an insulator, I mean, I didn't see it before. It was just a cast, and here it is, I mean, it's fine in the sea, Haki, without treatments \r\n\r\n00:19:53 BILAL \r\n. A. No. \r\n\r\n00:19:54 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Now it's changed, it's changed because they learned from previous houses that they can't stand the heat, identical to the second, yes \r\n\r\n00:20:00 BILAL \r\n. So the difference between the a, the isothermal, the expensive ones. You said it should be cheap or flimsy, and the isotherm is right, and the expensive ones are for tile and for people, but what else haven't I forgotten? \r\n\r\n00:20:14 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. It's Isocam, sometimes like something like a plaster, as if it's spread over the entire surface. They prevent moisture and they prevent heat, so they use it extensively, sometimes they don't even put any tiles on top of it, they just use it in a gray color. \r\n\r\n00:20:33 BILAL \r\n. Yeah, yeah, so this is the last thing, it's poured like paint, not thick, just complete it. \r\n\r\n00:20:41 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly it. \r\n\r\n00:20:42 BILAL \r\nF. This is the simplest thing, Isocam and tiles only. And what's the difference between the price and the insulation percentage between this and the other, the expensive one? What is the expensive one? \r\n\r\n00:20:57 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThe expensive one? I don't know exactly what color it is? Frankly, I don't have complete information about it, but its price would be something like, for example, its use and preparation would be more expensive, like the work per meter would be more expensive, for example, this would be something that would benefit someone, meaning that they would implement more, because I am an architect, so I just know the information, but sometimes I don't have it \r\n\r\n00:21:25 BILAL \r\nI did the work, they choose the materials and they know. Locally, I mean I want to see, what is made inside Iraq, right? \r\n\r\n00:21:33 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nNo problem, can I, for example? No problem? I'll ask you about them, I mean I'll get their names, and can I write them for you, a note on the time? \r\n\r\n00:21:44 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes, God willing, because I want, I mean, one of the things that he wants us to do is to have something like a library of materials, so that people can explore it, see it, need it, know it, put it, I mean put it outside in the sun, see justice, I mean make criminals \r\n\r\n00:22:01 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Should I write names for you? Or should I ask today the contractor like A or anyone who will help me, let him write me the names that are in the market, even. Even if, for example, he can take a picture of it, so that I don’t send you a picture \r\n\r\n00:22:13 BILAL \r\nIt’s nice, if you, I mean, you’re a very nice person that you graduated, and not only did you find a job, I mean you found a job that you started on your own, and I mean 50 houses or more? So, is it very nice for years? And you have a goal to open an office and oh, creativity and I don’t know what else is very nice. Oh, so I want to see, let’s say there are new engineering graduates, oh, and they want to learn something, I mean, in brief, that you didn’t learn in school, but you saw that it was very useful to you, regarding this idea of building green and insulation and the ideas of sustainability and low consumption. What? What did you teach people, I mean, shake their brains and they graduate and want to have work, they want people to know them, I mean, good work and their homes in this way. What are these benefits? What do you encourage them to learn or to study? \r\n\r\n00:23:10 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nUm, for example, when you were in the bachelor's degree program, before I entered the master's program, there was little focus on sustainability in my time. I didn't have much focus on sustainability, nor did you have special lessons on it. But now, the university has become more advanced and open to these subjects, or for example, sustainability is more, so that even from the first, second, and third grades, the professors introduce this method of sustainability and teach the students to use sustainability, unlike at that time. Our time was less. For example, when you entered the master's program, everything you learned, we had a special subject, which was sustainability. We learned how, for example, there are even special programs to measure and calculate the temperature and the thermal energy that the building produces. The building itself, but solar energy is the radiation that comes out of the building, like if it was concrete or something that collects sunlight in the morning, and then at night the temperature comes out on people. The best concrete stores the heat inside the material. 00:24:27 BILAL Training \r\nis not always \r\n\r\nonly for people who are very graduates, you expect, we have to focus when we go to invite people to bring them on people who may be the directors at your time and earlier, and even those who missed this subject. No, they did not learn it in college, yes, we share with them the yes, the new modern things that people are now getting tired of, when they want to graduate, we may focus on the existing offices, we find people who work in them and support them and encourage them to come and learn in a new building, yes, regarding the yes, and then they benefit, the office benefits, yes, and it benefits the people and benefits people and benefits the environment, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:25:08 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. God, I mean, especially if, for example, the names of the during \r\n\r\n00:25:14 BILAL \r\n. Programs \r\n\r\n00:25:17 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nthat measure, I mean, there is more than one program, because for example, programs for children, the sun's rays and the wind, there is, I mean, even the wind, even, for example, what might the shape of the building be, even if the wind doesn't affect us, and other than that, it measures, I mean, the times, I mean, the size, the window, the window, how much could it be? So that a lot of light doesn't pass into the space inside, especially if, for example, we have a building that has, I mean, for example, an office, the weather is always hot for them. Exactly. So, according to the program, it's possible, I mean, every now and then, if you make the window smaller, how much energy could pass into them from the heat of the sun on the employees inside, and what could be its effect? I mean, a strong program, maybe \r\n\r\n00:26:16 BILAL \r\ncalled, I mean, do you expect people to be able to learn it? I mean, our training is limited to five days. \r\n\r\n00:26:24 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. This is roughly, frankly, Ok. No, these are these programs, you know how we learned them? For example, in the Master’s degree, we would offer a seminar every two days, so in one day, if only, a little bit, maybe a few minutes, yes. So, for example, in one day, we would install and. And we would memorize what it changes and use it before, so we wouldn’t need a lot of time, it’s good, good, but we would learn the principles, what does it mean to measure and what does it show? What do we get the result for? And just quickly, the result would come out, without it being delayed, but for example, the program that I found difficult, because I used it for financial work, it’s part of Rhino, it’s yes without studying, there’s a name called Lady Box, it’s the one now, I had work between me, and I milked the sun, for example, from its right side, or this, for example \r\n\r\n00:27:24 BILAL \r\n. This is coming a little bit, I mean there is only a possibility that people know about it, because they are coming, I mean they are engineers \r\n\r\n00:27:31 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI mean, this is here now. Now here? I did and the movement of the sun, I mean, from what rises here to what sets here, so you see what I do with the units, that from a place where they shine but from where they are far from the sun, they are open, for example, there are people with the notebook, it is a little bit difficult for, I mean, a new user, for \r\n\r\n00:27:56 BILAL \r\nsomeone who has not done it before. But there is a possibility that the people we invite, we expect them to be graduates and people who work, I mean, architects and engineers, so there is a possibility that they will use it and be able to develop it, but who is it possible for us to choose the basic one, I mean? In the end, I expect the important thing, what is it? \r\n\r\n00:28:18 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI mean, is there anything easier than the ladybox? The result is just easier, I mean, for people who train \r\n\r\n00:28:25 BILAL \r\nThe thing that I think about is that you say that people are convinced and they like these things, but it would be nice, if we could give them, I mean, like the Maru, and tell them that if you choose this material, and they sold the sun coming to your house here, and I don’t know what the details are, in a year it reduces, I mean, energy consumption by 20%, so what do you pay for it? I mean, in general, electricity, we say a 20% decrease. It’s worth it. It’s worth it. It gets the cost and when will you get your money back. I mean, from these programs, I expect we can enter into this equation. This is one of the things that I mean, I expect it is important for people to know and do, because maybe not all people come as fans. At least we can tell them how we will benefit them, not just with regard to the break, I mean, when the electricity is off, the atmosphere is comfortable, and all of these are my concerns. Financially, the material is also convincing someone to put money in, so how can we convince him to put this money in exchange, meaning exchanging money in the future? So don’t worry about it. We can take from the and try to get these numbers from it. Do you expect us to be able to help us in this field? \r\n\r\n00:29:47 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI mean, the staff, for example, if we are going to work, for example, using sensors or anything electronic, maybe the mechatronics can help me, because I mean, you dealt with the lack of money that you did for the project since graduation. I mean, yes, I mean, did the people in Egypt help me? \r\n\r\n00:30:08 BILAL \r\n. But I'm talking about the Marling, I mean, I doubt in general, I mean, he will be able to help us do this equation, we tell them, this is the Savor, they sold this, this means the House X method, this is the House Y map, this is a map with, I mean, the insulator, the insulator, and I don't know what this map is. The. The. I mean, like any other house in Mosul, I mean, in a traditional, traditional way. Oh, and this will be the percentage of the heat absorbing from the sun, I don't know how many kilowatts, right? Is there a software expert who can help? What numbers can we get from it? Do we need maps? What do we need to include from the beginning? \r\n\r\n00:30:52 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nWe need, we need a 3D model of the whole building, meaning it should be a 3D model. If it's a 3D model, they can draw the house or even AutoCAD, but it should be a 3D model that we can enter into these programs like this one. I suggest that we use it, yes, and it's one of the programs that will give you statistics beforehand. It immediately gives us the result of each. A specific result. What does it mean? We could go back to doing what I said, for example, take a traditional house? And a house, I mean, we would have followed the same steps with sustainability, and we wouldn't notice the difference between, for example, the temperature inside the house with this model, and this one and the second model, which is after the improvements \r\n\r\n. 00:31:36 BILAL \r\n. So, I expect the sweetness of this is that there is something in it, not that someone comes to training without knowing what they will learn and how it will benefit them. No, we will say that we will teach these software, not only these ones, but also these ones. We will be able to make you more, I mean, convincing with B with because you will be able to tell them, what is the difference between this model and that model, and how will you be able to? I mean, will it benefit them financially over the years, because I mean, we don't always want to talk about what? Sustainability and green building, I mean, with the customer, this will not be convincing. I mean, there is a possibility that people will like the idea, it is something important to them, but at least in general, everyone understands that. The difference between the consumption of oil, energy, and electricity, I mean, the benefit that happens when someone opens a house and the electricity is turned off. How, how quickly will the heat go away? I mean, if you have an hour, or half an hour, or six hours, these simulations are useful in this area, they can help us have this discussion. It is possible, God willing \r\n\r\n00:32:50 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. It is with, I mean, there is a moment, I mean, if it is possible, no one has informed you about it, that there are many people today who use solar energy, so, I mean, even our house itself, we have prepared it for it, I mean, like we say \r\n\r\n00:33:05 BILAL \r\n. The good thing \r\n\r\n00:33:06 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. The things that we need for electricity are available in their place, even for example, after we reach a stage where, for example, it is not enough, for example, for 20 amps or more, it needs an amount. For example, we mean, in order not to reach this amount, we will accept to increase it, I mean, until we get rid of the generators, it is good yes, I mean, with the foundation, the electricity is not available until, I mean, no, for example, after we designed the house and finished, we go back and put in a new foundation, I mean \r\n\r\n00:33:37 BILAL \r\n, is it possible? In the future, what do you mean when will you need it? Maybe more panels? I did insulation. If you focus on the \r\n\r\n00:33:49 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. The most important thing is that we did insulation, meaning inside, like I told you, this material, I don't remember its name, but it's like the plaster, meaning the stinginess inside, because we didn't complete the exterior facade, so I was thinking about who would use the exterior materials after that. I used an insulating material, and the roof itself. I told you that we used cork with us, and insulating materials, and you. Can, or I don't remember what its exact name was. If it weren't for the blue material, I don't remember the engineer advised me that it was better on its own. So we used it with the tiles and cork, and really, the second floor made a big difference. Yes \r\n\r\n00:34:26 BILAL \r\n. Good, God willing. This is one of the things that people should take into consideration. Not only do they say that it makes a difference, but they can tell me that Bilal used to say that in the summer, when it was 45 degrees outside, it would be 30 inside. Now, when we put this on, it was 45 and inside, without the air conditioning, it became, I mean, it doesn’t matter. I mean, numbers, but there isn’t a lot. They have numbers. Hahaha. I want, I want numbers. \r\n\r\n00:34:58 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThe problem is, for example, when I compare our new house with our old house, for example, before our old house, I couldn’t stand to go out, for example, I could sit in my room and take it easy without turning on the air conditioner. But now, it’s normal for me to go up to the second floor and use my room like a bank. Isn’t that nice? \r\n\r\n00:35:16 BILAL \r\nIs that nice? \r\n\r\n00:35:18 ANFAL \r\nYATHRIB But the old house, without, without ports, no one would have been able to go up \r\n\r\n00:35:22 BILAL \r\n. Upstairs, it's impossible \r\n\r\n00:35:24 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Especially, it means \r\n\r\n00:35:26 BILAL \r\n. If you want to say, it means the number, it doesn't have to be exactly 100%, but when you say it doesn't revive, it doesn't revive, meaning, two heritages, 3540, meaning, this is the number so we can start \r\n\r\n00:35:38 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. It's like, for example, you're outside, you're standing, it's like outside the house, but the temperature means \r\n\r\n00:35:45 BILAL \r\n. And \r\n\r\n00:35:45 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. As for this woman, it means 1/2 the temperature, for example, if the ground floor is cold, the upper floor, for example, half, I advise MM. The ground always matches the further away the colder \r\n\r\n00:35:59 BILAL \r\nWhat is the temperature outside today? \r\n\r\n00:36:04 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nToday? \r\n\r\n00:36:04 BILAL \r\n. By God, I will not ask, I will ask Mosul, Iraq, and this let us see the weather in Mosul today \r\n\r\n00:36:14 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. I see \r\n\r\n00:36:16 BILAL \r\nMobile? What is this Celsius? I see that today they say that the high is 40? \r\n\r\n00:36:29 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nWhat? \r\n\r\n00:36:29 BILAL \r\nOkay, so if the high is 40, do you know what the first floor is? Where is it? \r\n\r\n00:36:37 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Now, my ground floor is 30, meaning I'm on the ground floor, \r\n\r\n00:36:41 BILAL \r\n, and the one above is 35. Something like that? \r\n\r\n00:36:45 ANFAL YATHRIB, \r\nis it possible that if I go up, it's wider exactly, and the heat comes out, for sure? \r\n\r\n00:36:49 BILAL \r\nYes, yes, but if we didn't have this insulation on the roof, it would be 37, meaning it's like outside \r\n\r\n00:36:56 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. I mean, it's impossible for anyone to bear the heat if they didn't use insulation on the roof, wow, wow, I mean, the whole world knows this result, yes, yes, I mean, we need statistics, frankly, yes, I mean, it's possible for one solution, for example, to be able to sleep at two o'clock in the afternoon on the second floor, but if he doesn't get stuck \r\n\r\n00:37:13 BILAL \r\n. Sweet, sweet, it means that you are not only talking about the subject of sustainability and insulation and solar energy, and I don’t know what else, you have a whole system in place at home, so you know this, you know what it was, I mean the price that you were paying for the generator, I mean there is a difference, I mean there is a difference in the monthly cost of the house, the consumption of the house \r\n\r\n00:37:40 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nYes, I mean the devices that take the Yes, for example, the drainage, no cooling or air conditioning devices, but because, for example, it is outside, so it remained the same, the same crew \r\n\r\n00:37:52 BILAL \r\nMaybe the house is bigger, if it is possible, I mean, you were comfortable at 30 degrees, now you want it to be 24, so how come? \r\n\r\n00:38:06 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Hahaha, like the new house became like each person has a room isolated from the other, so it became, I mean, after that, their spending remained the same as before, yes, because there were additional rooms. \r\n\r\n00:38:19 BILAL \r\n, good, good. So, now we have part of the training. I expect it will be about these programs, and it will be clear, I mean, you? You have a lot of experience, and it’s very nice. People, God willing, will be able to benefit from you, and about these programs in particular. I expect, so let’s say if we have a five-day training, and I mean, there might be more than one trainer who will evaluate them per day, there is a possibility that you will be the one who will present the programs, and I mean, like I said at the beginning, there are two topics: that I learn from you, which I can’t, and the role of trainers, or trainers. This is something paid, I mean, there is a fee for it, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:39:08 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. It's not a problem, but the time \r\n\r\n00:39:10 BILAL \r\nI'm in. It may, it may be useful for you to do only the days, so if it's five days in a row, meaning one after the other, but you may only do two days of the program and the financials, I mean, how good are the programs and how do you convince people in this way that you're doing models and the idea is okay? \r\n\r\n00:39:35 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Okay, but time is very important, because I, in addition to it being my own job, I study at an institute, so it doesn't mean it doesn't conflict with time \r\n\r\n00:39:49 BILAL \r\nthat they are the ones who make the arrangements the the the the timing, I mean they let the young people find people, this is not my job, \r\n\r\n00:40:00 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. I mean everything, I mean I love this idea, on the contrary I want to help you, I mean everything I mean I'm excited about it, but because I mean we were committed to the institute before this project, so God willing, God willing \r\n\r\n00:40:12 BILAL \r\nGod willing, God willing. There is a possibility that they will tell you that it means okay, if it's difficult for you these days we can do this, if so, we can fix it, that's not the problem now, what I want to try or I mean learn it, inquire as much as we can, I mean the best thing we can share, the information you have, the experience you have so we can share it, and people, one of the questions that comes to my mind is that houses are getting smaller, and you talked a number of times about the issue of the insulation of the walls and the idea of lighting and spirits and winds and things, one of the things that I want to hear from other people is that there is a tradition that people build houses, such as these, with big windows. Facing south, or they become like an oven. Oh, and because there is oh, I mean, to facilitate the I don't know the map, if it's permissible to tea in it on TikTok, if Instagram says this, I like a big window, because it has lighting, I don't know what, and we are the things that I want, I mean, what is the color of you, or do you deal with people who want something traditional and encourage them, no, decorate the windows and put it in a garden inside the house, even if it's small, I mean 20 m. What do you mean? What do you mean? I mean, when you deal with these people? You'd always get tick tock, aya, we're on it better, teaches big Shabbat and I don't know what? I mean, when you deal with them, what do you say? \r\n\r\n00:41:46 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nHonestly? For example, I explain to them, the idea is that if they were to leave the window like this, it might increase the heat on them, and then it would cost them more while they are still in the place. But if they are not convinced, we can have them come up with alternative options. For example, if they see a model they like in the house. What do they think? The picture, for example, of the one they want to imitate? I try, for example, to make them something better than the original, and with designs that I like, and there is a large percentage who are convinced. But the ones who remain, I mean, are not really attached to their idea. I mean, there are people like this who don’t care about, for example, there are alternatives, for example, there are the coolers that we can use with blocks that they don’t use now, and they say, for example, we close the sun block from the window, and then this \r\n\r\n00:42:44 BILAL \r\nis the window. Okay, no problem. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:42:49 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. It means. But the important thing is that there are many customers who care about the external appearance at the expense of, oh \r\n\r\n00:42:55 BILAL \r\n. I mean, the external appearance, even the neighbors see it \r\n\r\n00:43:01 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Secondly, it hurts them, yes, even if they say, oh, this house is really nice \r\n\r\n00:43:04 BILAL \r\nThere is a really nice house, that uses, I mean, the green approach that benefits sustainability, if most of the really nice houses, they come from Europe and I don't know what else, \r\n\r\n00:43:16 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. No, no, there are houses, I mean, they're very nice and classy, and more, of course, I mean, Baghdad, I mean, there are engineers, I know from Baghdad, I mean, their work is very wonderful, to the point that sometimes they don't leave you a single window in the front, but, because yes, by God, hahaha, if you want, I'll send you the opening \r\n\r\n00:43:33 BILAL \r\nWhat's it? I mean, what? As much as we can? \r\n\r\n00:43:35 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. We learn, I mean, let's just, just, because you're all young or what? Oh, but they let us have the openness inside the house, I mean, the open person inside the house, because Baghdad is much hotter than us, so I mean, people are usually more convinced than Mosul \r\n\r\n00:43:53 BILAL \r\n. They need, he needs \r\n\r\n00:43:54 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Of course, a degree. It's normal for them to have a closed front facade but an open one in the middle of the house, like the houses in eastern Mosul that exist. I mean, this. This \r\n\r\n00:44:07 BILAL \r\nThe idea that you implemented, I mean, is there something like it? \r\n\r\n00:44:13 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nYes, it's the same with us, but you made an internal garden in the middle of the house, I mean, except that our house is basically a corner, and I have light from everywhere, but I wanted to make it an internal garden in the middle of the house. And did you plant it? \r\n\r\n00:44:26 BILAL \r\nThe square in front of the garden inside the house \r\n\r\n00:44:30 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nYes, yes, it's very nice, I mean, you made it three by three, and each one means that the plants are, I mean, there's no place like, for example, yes, no, not like a small one, no, I mean, big plants \r\n\r\n00:44:41 BILAL \r\nOn the ground. A plant on the ground is worth. I mean \r\n\r\n00:44:50 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nNo, no. Not everything is big, I mean, more ornamental plants, but I mean, there is a size M. I mean, two meters, huh? \r\n\r\n00:44:58 BILAL \r\nWhat do you mean, did you notice? Young man, from this garden, I mean, what were the benefits that you expected? And what were the benefits that you didn't expect? But you felt them after you built the house and lived in it? \r\n\r\n00:45:15 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nWhat? Honestly, I don't regret doing it at all, especially since I didn't need lighting from this place, because the house is a corner where light would come in from all sides, but I mean, like, what are we like? We, the people of Mosul, don't like to sit in the garden all the time. I even have an outdoor garden, and it's very big, but it's like, for example, we don't feel comfortable, especially as girls, so we say, let's register and live in it than being inside the house, and you, you mean, sit in the sitting area in front of you, it's more comfortable, I mean, and it's not very nice, and even, for example, on the second floor, I made a balcony overlooking it, so even on the second floor, you can sit on the veranda and it's \r\n\r\n00:46:01 BILAL \r\n. The view is like a joke and the one above you put it, meaning a glass that opens, is blocked, closed \r\n\r\n00:46:09 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. It moves by closing it from when it rains until what, because when it rains on plants they get saturated, meaning water, so they die. So I made an important system, meaning a drainage system for the plants from the excess water and nothing else, I made it, meaning a moving one, so when it rains I close it, because even then no. Then the water gets in and comes out \r\n\r\n00:46:31 BILAL \r\nOkay, this means when you have the air conditioning and the air conditioning is on and the window is open or not? \r\n\r\n00:46:42 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThe window must be closed of course, but what about the days before the temperature? Is it possible to open the window at night and it lets air in? Does it pull air in? \r\n\r\n00:46:55 BILAL \r\n. Second, so that the wind can pass through \r\n\r\n00:46:59 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nNo. No, I don't need to, but I open the window with the same skylight with the garden. Does it pass through? Does it pass through and get pulled inside? I don't know, is it possible? \r\n\r\n00:47:08 BILAL \r\nIs it still effective? \r\n\r\n00:47:10 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nWithout needing to, I open the second window \r\n\r\n00:47:12 BILAL \r\nis the possibility of effectiveness, meaning it will be stronger if it is, meaning in a place, meaning in the direction of the wind, you open a second opening, but if \r\n\r\n00:47:21 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nyou accused \r\n\r\n00:47:22 BILAL \r\nYes. You don't need to do anything else. I'll try. Yes, try, try, because this is one of the If we can cool the house at night, it will take a long time until we need to use the air conditioning during the day, this is the idea of how we can benefit from this arrangement of yours, but only if you were able to convince yourself, it doesn't mean with 50 houses, but only one garden \r\n\r\n00:47:45 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. No, it's impossible, I mean, there are clients who love me, they always come and tell me I want an indoor garden, sometimes they put a fountain in it, and the water isn't nice, they also mean it looks nice, and. And they love this fountain, but honestly I get annoyed by the sound of the fountain, so I used it, but I mean, walls, a decorative wall and plants without a fountain \r\n\r\n00:48:07 BILAL \r\n. Yes, you, do you know anything about A? The difference with the fountain is that I've heard of ginger and I don't know what A and water, I mean, definitely? It cools the world, and I mean, what is its effectiveness, I mean, compared to trees without trees, a garden, without a fountain garden \r\n\r\n00:48:29 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI mean, no. I mean, I didn't feel it the times, if I mean, I'll explain the subject to you, there are houses that use this internal skylight, which they call an internal garden. These six make a culture without it moving, I mean, without it opening and closing, yeah, and they add the fountain. The fountain, what does it do? It creates the atmosphere, and humidity, I mean, what? For example, does it become humid? \r\n\r\n00:48:54 BILAL \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n00:48:55 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. I mean. With. With the presence of the fountain, the formula, the atmosphere is humid, so we hide it in a hole, even the windows that they turned water into, I mean, they have to add a phone that pulls the air from inside the skylight \r\n\r\n00:49:12 BILAL \r\n. Ah \r\n\r\n00:49:12 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nYeah, that means a greenhouse disaster. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:49:16 BILAL \r\n. Yeah, that's true. I mean, if there aren't always open openings, I mean, if the garden isn't always open on the roof, and there's a way to control the water and the wind coming in and out, the fountain won't help, because then, once it breaks the humidity, it becomes even hotter with the humidity. \r\n\r\n00:49:33 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Yeah, Abu Zawiya. But I saw it in houses, I mean, this is a disaster. They said they have a disaster. Don't they add, like, an extractor on the roofs? I mean, so it extracts the hot air so they don't have humidity, or they don't hang it, basically, for the fountain so I don't have water? That's the problem. Okay? And they leave the open one and it closes again, because for us, for example. Who covered it up? As if the A means space, as if it is a greenhouse, meaning it collects heat \r\n\r\n00:50:11 BILAL \r\nUm, why did the line cut off, just a minute, what did you say? What does a greenhouse become? Who do they do it for? What? \r\n\r\n00:50:19 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Who covers the skylight or the garden with glass and the heat comes in? The sun doesn’t shine on us, its atmosphere is a share, a heat source, meaning \r\n\r\n00:50:30 BILAL \r\n. If the window doesn’t open, meaning if it’s always closed, that’s fine, yes, the \r\n\r\n00:50:36 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. If it’s always closed and there’s no A, meaning a fan that draws in the moisture \r\n\r\n00:50:42 BILAL \r\nYes, yes, it needs, everyone needs this, so people need to be taught, meaning if it’s going to be put here immediately, you need to think point by point, point, point, before \r\n\r\n00:50:52 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Now, I mean, they are treating the mistakes of this arrest, I mean, they are using it immediately, but by God, I mean, honestly, I mean, I saw this situation, they are the solutions, I mean, the adjustment is bad, \r\n\r\n00:51:05 BILAL \r\nIf so, if you could send me that, the, the, the, the company in Baghdad that makes the houses that you like, I mean, small windows, gardens, I don’t know what, I mean, I want to see the people who implement these ideas. \r\n\r\n00:51:21 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nHonestly, I mean, I don’t know them, I didn’t know about them, but I mean, I like their style . \r\n\r\n00:51:27 BILAL \r\nWhat’s its name? The companies in Iraq, in Baghdad? \r\n\r\n00:51:30 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThey are, I mean, more than one architectural team. Now, I’m looking for its name, okay, okay? \r\n\r\n00:51:39 BILAL \r\n. Sweet, this is great, I mean, sometimes when I think about the subject, because I am outside of Iraq, and I don’t know everything about design and I mean AutoCAD and Grays Hopper and all these things, but I see them, I mean, how will I do this design? But this is not my job, my job is to find people, nice, smart people like you, and connect between people, this, this is something that they understand at least the least possible so that I can understand how to focus? The people, the materials, and the environment that will benefit, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:52:10 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Ok \r\n\r\n00:52:11 BILAL \r\nOkay, one of the ideas I had, if you have the two models, we can do the analysis before the lesson, so we make a traditional house and do the lighting, heat, windows, and all the details and numbers and the price that we expect monthly for the electricity and generator, and I don't know what that means in general, and then a house with a garden and smaller windows, oh, but I still want to understand. What do they do outside? So? There are no windows, do they put them up, I mean a wall that they come and pour? \r\n\r\n00:52:48 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Yes, they use very thin and long windows, or they open them, I mean, it's not in front of me on a page, I mean \r\n\r\n00:52:56 BILAL \r\nWhat is Jamila? \r\n\r\n00:52:58 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI mean on a page, yeah, I mean from the prominent block page, for example? Yeah? \r\n\r\n00:53:02 BILAL \r\n. Yes, at \r\n\r\n00:53:02 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n, meaning it is not facing the sun, but on the sun’s side, meaning on the right or the left, right? \r\n\r\n00:53:08 BILAL \r\nSo if the house is not facing the wall, on the right, exactly on the sun, they put the window \r\n\r\n00:53:13 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. I sent you the WhatsApp account \r\n\r\n00:53:15 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes, let’s see \r\n\r\n00:53:16 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nSo is it possible? \r\n\r\n00:53:19 BILAL \r\n. That you see, yes, very nice. Yes \r\n\r\n00:53:21 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Exactly, them? I mean, even if you see a profile with it, yes, I mean, there is. Its facade, I mean, it’s very small \r\n\r\n00:53:34 BILAL \r\n. Wait, I'm going to see if Instagram is okay, but then it's okay, and then I see that it means I'm wasting a lot of time, but when I open a few pictures \r\n\r\n00:53:45 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nWhat's the problem? I mean, they use the jinn inside? \r\n\r\n00:53:49 BILAL \r\n. Sweet, what's this? Do you know them or not? Wow, if you see all this consciously, a white wall, and a few windows of faith in the cloakroom, and then the cold ones are closed and it's clear that this is the house. This is coming out \r\n\r\n00:54:05 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThey take a screenshot of ourselves? \r\n\r\n00:54:07 BILAL \r\n. The house. This is coming out. \r\n\r\n00:54:09 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThey use? \r\n\r\n00:54:10 BILAL \r\n. Yes. Wow. \r\n\r\n00:54:11 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Yes. They use screens that they open and close as they need. They mean that it's an external screen, even if it's just like a polygon. It doesn't even have a pattern. Yes. \r\n\r\n00:54:22 BILAL \r\n. But no at all. No. I mean, I see this, and something. I mean, where is this palm tree? Where is it located? I see the palm tree there? They have a garden. Is this a big palm tree behind it? \r\n\r\n00:54:33 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThere are, for example, inside the house, they leave gardens inside the house. \r\n\r\n00:54:39 BILAL \r\nThank you for sharing this with me. I mean, if I really liked it, I want this house, hahaha. \r\n\r\n00:54:45 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nBut, I mean, you can see the videos that were implemented, I mean, the designs implemented inside. You will see the houses that they filmed and implemented, I mean, even they are. \r\n\r\n00:54:59 BILAL \r\nBut \r\n\r\n00:55:00 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nAre these 3D pictures, right? No. \r\n\r\n00:55:02 BILAL \r\nNo, they are not real pictures. Oh, okay, I thought this was true? \r\n\r\n00:55:08 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThe video? Real pictures, the video, oh . \r\n\r\n00:55:12 BILAL \r\nPictures, God willing, God willing. Later. But honestly, it's obvious. I have to try. I mean, if you know them well, it's good for me to communicate with them. If I try, I mean, I'll call them a few times. Hahaha. If I want to talk to them \r\n\r\n00:55:24 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nIs she from Baghdad? No problem? \r\n\r\n00:55:26 BILAL \r\nNo, no, it doesn't matter. Because one day this is a home project. It started in the first year, and we have three years left, I expect, and we'll start in Mosul, and we'll definitely invite anyone who has useful experience to come and apply. I know them. And then we'll expand. I mean, the project will one day be in Baghdad, maybe Basra, maybe Erbil, I mean it will expand from Mosul. \r\n\r\n00:55:51 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nIs it possible for you to communicate with them, I think? \r\n\r\n00:55:54 BILAL \r\nThey're really nice to answer, right? \r\n\r\n00:55:56 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. She is more than an author \r\n\r\n00:55:58 BILAL \r\nIt means clean, tidy, nice and important work. It is clear that their name is Co-Eco Corporation. They are trying to achieve sustainability in a way that suits the Iraqi climate. They will know more than anyone. You also clearly have a lot of experience, but? \r\n\r\n00:56:23 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI mean, it doesn't help me, I mean, with my hopes, it doesn't help me anymore to become, for example, I mean, even my clients don't allow me to become a Muslim anymore. \r\n\r\n00:56:30 BILAL \r\nDo you expect the cost to be part of the problem? Part of the problem, or what is the problem? \r\n\r\n00:56:38 ANFAL \r\nYATHRIB The problem is, Muslawi, for example, that they, for example, are jealous of the neighbors or sometimes want to imitate, or this, I mean, is more of an end for them, not like the people of Baghdad. \r\n\r\n00:56:50 BILAL \r\n. For us, it will take a long time, maybe things will happen, but if we build these 50 houses, you do what you want. They will make you, you have this small garden and you have the... \r\n\r\n00:57:04 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Stupid professor, what do you mean? When I was working with offices, I mean, I am not the owner of them, so whoever I want, I force or convince the customer, so the manager doesn't have the right to tell me no, you don't, you don't, don't impose anything on them, or you're not responsible for this, so I don't, I mean, I don't give you, I mean, I do something, but now, when I work, I will have my own office. I won't take on any customers unless I follow my style, so that's who I am. Ok, it's longer, I mean it took a while for me to do my office, but the important thing is that it's the same \r\n\r\n00:57:35 BILAL \r\n. It's necessary. We must try to involve office owners in your project. Any idea? What color? Can we bring them in? I had an idea that they should come and be like wise men at the end of the project. We'll do something simple like, you have 150 square feet. Oh, what did you learn? How will you be able to do this? This budget? This budget does the owner of the house have? Oh, their privacy. Go build a house, and you have this budget. Then tell me, how much will you save it year after year? B B. I mean, implementing sustainable ideas. Then we bring in company owners. They say, this is a good project, this is a bad project. This is worth it, this isn't even worth it. First of all, it's one of our goals for people to have job opportunities or the possibility that one person can do everything, meaning he has a good job, he knows the ropes of everything well. One is very clever. It is possible to speed up the relationship at the beginning, meaning he says work with and with one of the gains, and at the same time we start changing the thinking of the offices because they are now the ones who have to say yes this is the. This house has these sustainable things, and benefits people, so it is not you who go and convince them that I want to present this idea, because they are the ones who put this. I like this idea. Hahaha, in Y, it changes the thinking. God willing, a little bit \r\n\r\n00:59:10 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nOkay, and sometimes, I mean, let me explain to you. Sometimes, I mean, the owner of the house does not trust the office much because sometimes the offices take a large percentage of the implementation. He works on design, sustainability, and then it means that the office makes a profit from it, so even as I mentioned, it will be double the amount, sometimes he does without this thing, but on the mood that it means double, okay, because the head of the office, for example, takes a percentage, and the material is expensive anyway, so my wife, it means that there is no need \r\n\r\n00:59:43 BILAL \r\nCan we, I mean, prevent this idea? Yes, how can we? \r\n\r\n00:59:46 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nDo you mean that we cut it off? I mean, for example, does the head of the office not need to take his percentage from anything except the sustainable material? \r\n\r\n00:59:54 BILAL \r\nThey document that they. I will not take a percentage from any promotions, for sure. Hahaha \r\n\r\n01:00:02 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThis is the problem, I know this is the problem, I am sure of it \r\n\r\n01:00:05 BILAL \r\nDo you know what now? He suggests the materials and the customer buys and brings them \r\n\r\n01:00:14 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nAnd the problem with the labor force, they take. What is not from their pocket, the worker who makes it takes a percentage from the work. And then he arranges the material or assembles the material, he will take a percentage from him. Imagine the problem? \r\n\r\n01:00:28 BILAL \r\n. Do you have a solution? Do you have a solution? Can you close it? I solved half of it, which is that the customer buys the materials hahaha. Now the worker's hand \r\n\r\n01:00:36 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nIt's the same as what I said, meaning now people use it, but the trade is that the shop itself agrees with us and they agree with the labor force from the place that, for example, works from the material, he works on it and, I mean, implements it and buys it, and sometimes they give him a discount, for example, if he implements it, he gets a little discount with it. I mean, if he uses the material from you and they give him a person, will he work when it is? \r\n\r\n01:01:07 BILAL \r\nThe owner of the house, the engineer, will implement it. If not, what? What? \r\n\r\n01:01:13 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI mean, except for the office, except for the office, for example, I am a customer, or I am a person who wants to use a material for my house, for example, an insulating material, yes, I go to the place that sells these materials, and for example, if the person is the one who will sell the material, if, for example, he suggests that he sells me this material at a price, and if I use his labor, he is the one who \r\n\r\n01:01:35 BILAL \r\n. He will write me E.E., so this percentage will be lower, since it is all in the same, the same company \r\n\r\n01:01:42 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThe same thing, so this way I will be less on the head of the house, and it is possible that they will require, or they will make a discount on the price of the material, if he uses labor from the same company, \r\n\r\n01:01:52 BILAL \r\n. I heard about a great idea that I liked. I don't know if it would solve the problem, but it is a nice person. Someone told the owner of the house that I will do this insulation for you. If the temperature difference, I mean without air conditioning, from outside to inside, does not change until it is less than ten, ten, ten degrees minus. You don't pay to install it for you, I will do it for you. All the work, you don't pay anything. Until now, do you feel this difference \r\n\r\n? \r\n\r\n01:02:25 ANFAL YATHRIB Is this an agreement? Is it possible with thermistan, right? \r\n01:02:29 BILAL \r\nWhat do you think this is? Yes, thermistan is an insulator? \r\n\r\n01:02:33 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n.as. A thermistoneham yamela. A difference of 10 degrees, yes, \r\n\r\n01:02:37 BILAL \r\nMore, but this means, yes, don't say it, say it with M, I mean, encourage this person who does this? \r\n\r\n01:02:43 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Yes, but honestly, I encourage \r\n\r\n01:02:45 BILAL \r\n. One would be sitting, one of the sweet things, because I mean, if one starts saying, “Hey, he’s going to take a percentage here, a percentage there,” but then you tell him there’s a 10-degree difference in temperature between the outside and the outside, the thinking changes. What does he get out of it? He says, “A dollar here, a dollar here,” and this will trick anyone, I don’t know what it will be? Cool, how will this be a benefit? And I mean, I’m much more comfortable at home, and it changes the equation a little bit in thinking \r\n\r\n01:03:12 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. It means sometimes you know how they are, the idea that we convince the customer for me, I mean I am more, less, yes, for example, if he doesn’t use it for the entire house, it means that its cost doesn’t become high, maybe just your facade, I mean, but the walls on the facade, this way, it will reduce a percentage, meaning the cost will decrease, and he accepts to use it, I mean before he agrees to the idea, yes, he doesn’t mind that the walls that will be on the facade are perfect, your temperature is perfect, everything, it will be an Eid gift, I know that this \r\n\r\n01:03:43 BILAL \r\nThere is something very nice, which is that you make the customer feel that you are thinking with him, not against him, I mean, you have a material, I mean, it is limited, not everyone has billions and billions of dollars, so let me see what is the simplest thing? Then it is more useful, this, it is permissible for the walls of this ratio, and this means what difference will it make, I mean the monthly rent, money, oil money, if you built all the walls this much, but if you cannot, I mean at least I advise you, but seriously, this is on the sun, yes, this is nice, and then he thinks that you and him think if you think, yes, it is nice, good, yes, the one who replied, see, I mean, if you have, yes, you have Motolan Houses 3D Max, or AutoCAD, which we can use in the program to make these two different equations on the 150 square feet, the same, the same, the same direction on the sun, but one in it, I mean, yes, walls, yes, with this cork, yes, with yes, let's forget the roof now because I want to think, yes, about the houses that we can make, so this house has walls, of cork, I mean, we added cork to it, yes, and I don't know if we can add a garden to an existing house, hahaha, but I mean, Madeleine, let's compare them, I mean, and let's see what numbers the program will go They give us, and how can we benefit from what they have? \r\n\r\n01:05:14 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. The problem if we use these programs, maybe they don't read the cork, or I have to make sure of it, for example, if there is cork on the interface or not, because each one has a system, \r\n\r\n01:05:28 BILAL \r\n, so we can bring the closest thing to it. What is in the system? \r\n\r\n01:05:34 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. I mean, I just have to go back. I have to go to the program and see if it exists in this material, otherwise, even if it exists, it would be better. And regarding the models you want me to have, it's not a problem if we, for example, prepare for them \r\n\r\n01:05:53 BILAL \r\n. Yes, for training \r\n\r\n01:05:54 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Prepare them, right? It's not a problem. I mean, for example, it's possible that you don't see them with houses that you've implemented before, but I'm working on a new model for them \r\n\r\n01:06:04 BILAL \r\n. Yes, God willing, I expect this to be all good, it's good that it's something, not just this new material. We'll give it to them as a coffee shop. I mean, if you want to imitate, imitate this from us, is that something? Yes. Yes. \r\n\r\n01:06:18 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nYes, it's not a problem that we can do the same floor plan, but with solutions, one bad one, one that after we use all the sustainable solutions, yes \r\n\r\n01:06:29 BILAL , \r\nand then or one \r\n\r\n01:06:29 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. For example, it's not an ordinary one, it's a typical house, yes \r\n\r\n01:06:34 BILAL \r\n. Ordinary, and a sustainable house, and I mean with the average material, not that everything is perfect, it has to be the modest things that you expect. The middle class in Mosul, if they are convinced of it, they can do it. And it's not just for people who have a lot of money. We want to see the largest number of homes we can help with, in terms of the new house construction. At the same time, we need to share ideas, whether that's what we're talking about or in this regard. I wanted to ask you about the ideas for interior design. There are things, interior design, I forgot, I thought about it, that benefit sustainability, which from your knowledge and experience, you know. \r\n\r\n01:07:27 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nIn interior design, the most important thing is this cement material that will protect the interior walls from the heat. Other than that, sustainability is basically when someone uses greenery, plants inside, or even affects his psychology. Psychologically, it's more comfortable for the person living in the house than if these spaces weren't there. There's a lot of research that supports this talk. For example, houses that use plants and water, and I mean, something natural, the desire of the customers, or I mean the residents, is for it to be better than the others, I mean, people who don't have these spaces \r\n\r\n01:08:13 BILAL \r\nYes, that's right, and it means \r\n\r\n01:08:18 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI forgot what it was called? With my mountains. But it has a complete study, I mean? \r\n\r\n01:08:30 BILAL \r\nDo you expect people to? I mean, we always have to think seriously and effectively? \r\n\r\n01:08:34 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nDoes it mean realism? \r\n\r\n01:08:36 BILAL \r\nWhat? What? \r\n\r\n01:08:39 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n.pedophilia. That's what they call it, multi-video, they use biology in them \r\n\r\n01:09:01 BILAL \r\nThey all need Zaki, they're all a little thirsty. But thank God I have plants at home. The nature of people in Mosul is to like plants at home. They know how to take care of them, when they clean the ground, I mean, the water, and I don't know what that means, what is it, something realistic? Oh, do you expect people to be able to do that? \r\n\r\n01:09:23 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nArtificial plants? \r\n\r\n01:09:23 BILAL \r\nMy situation, if it weren't for the fact that I don't know. I mean, tell me, hahaha, like, mama. Ma. I don't know anything. What do you think people use artificial plants for? \r\n\r\n01:09:34 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. They know \r\n\r\n01:09:34 BILAL \r\nWhat are their habits with plants? \r\n\r\n01:09:36 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. And they are addicted to plants, most of them before? Oh. But for example, they used to use automatic methods, for example, the sprinklers might be the ones that water the garden, especially if you forgot to turn them on. \r\n\r\n01:10:00 BILAL \r\nWho can do that? They drink a lot of tea, so if you're going to make tea, you pour two cups. First, put one down. Plant the second one. You... E... E... The house needs tea, too. Not only people in the house drink tea, I don't know. Hahaha, remind me of it later. But honestly, I learned a lot from you, and I benefited a lot, and... \r\n\r\n01:10:22 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Biophilia \r\n\r\n01:10:24 BILAL \r\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, that's it. This is its role, I see it as biophilic design, a natural environment. I expect it to be something nice, maybe simple and cheap, and maybe the interaction of it will be great. I mean, the long idea is that it's just \r\n\r\n01:10:54 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. For example, from 2018 or 2017, I want to design houses that start \r\n\r\n01:10:58 BILAL \r\n. Thinking \r\n\r\n01:10:59 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Compared to this, I remember a long time ago and I still don't know if it's 2025, I mean, the world's outlook has changed a lot, and the clients, I mean, where? Before? Where now? I mean, before, they didn't care about the indoor garden or the plants, but now, this time, no, all the. I mean, what, I mean, even if the space is very small. It leaves the plants, even if they're inside a staircase, but the important thing is that I mean, women exactly, which means let us \r\n\r\n01:11:29 BILAL \r\n. A place where they trample it, they trample it. I've heard of it, but I don't know. I'll say it, \r\n\r\nGod willing. \r\n\r\n01:11:36 ANFAL \r\nYATHRIB . \r\n01:11:37 BILAL \r\n. But business, I mean, they say every house, I mean maybe the old house has a basement. \r\n\r\n01:11:43 ANFAL YATHRIB . The basement is gone. \r\n\r\n01:11:44 BILAL. \r\nWe benefit from it. We think about it. Why? \r\n\r\n01:11:48 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI'm talking about it. It's used at this time, and even houses, for example, my grandfather's houses have two basements, but I mean, this is it. For example, whoever works or sells this house, the basement will collapse. This is impossible. Ah, it doesn't mean that the person who takes the land will never come back and make a basement on it. I mean, do you know what you're talking about? Exactly? But why? \r\n\r\n01:12:15 BILAL \r\nIts price? \r\n\r\n01:12:18 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n.30,000,000 needs. The entire basement is healthy and so on, meaning 30,000,000. Everyone says, for example, instead of building a basement, they build a second floor, so. For example, what's the problem? These houses used to be big, now for example, yes, they've become smaller pieces, so all these houses with the houses, our grandfathers' houses were 400 square meters, 500 square meters, now they've become 150, so every time they die, the houses become inviolable, I mean, but unfortunately this is the reality, I mean, even my grandfather's house, now my grandfathers died and the inheritance was divided, so he sold the house and. And not, I mean, the one who bought us new, they demolished it and built two houses, instead of 400, it became 200 by 200. Without basements, yes \r\n\r\n01:13:15 BILAL \r\n. And everyone has no basement. There is an idea, I mean, not a basement, a basement, I mean, like Jabal and Jbeil \r\n\r\n01:13:27 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. The cost is \r\n\r\n01:13:28 BILAL \r\n. I mean, it's possible \r\n\r\n01:13:29 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. We always make half a floor buried in the ground, so that, for example, sometimes there are customers who accept, for example, to make this a place for the gym or for example, to exercise, and part of it is for the car, meaning it's a basement, to take the house for the car and the rest and the part that they use, to make it a storage place or for games or anything, meaning space. It depends on the customer and the cost, because this is so long that it becomes something buried in the ground, the reinforcement always has to be a lot \r\n\r\n01:14:17 BILAL \r\n. They call it in English the foundation, the basic foundation of the Schranz house. You have to pour the foundation, I mean, the foundation, and build the house on top of it so that its foundation is \r\n\r\n01:14:31 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. It needs iron. But he tells you it's strong so that the house can bear it, so it needs a higher percentage of iron, so it becomes more on the client. Some of them agree if they have a budget, and there are very few who agree depending on the idea they are convinced of, or if they have money, I mean \r\n\r\n01:14:50 BILAL \r\nYou, I mean, I don't know about if hahaha. A few times I try to think as a creative design designer, I don't know what, but yeah. The basement, I mean, the reason the basement is cold, because it is underground, deep and underground, there is a temperature that is always almost the same temperature all year round, but we might not need a basement, because there is a possibility that we can ascend this coldness to, like iron above the casting, using, you see, the irons that they build with, meaning we can bury it all the time, and it can come out and be poured over it, but at least it should be thermal mass joel art niger, meaning we weld it to its iron in the garden, so this iron whose temperature will be like the temperature underground without a basement, and even the wind and the plants, all this cold that comes into the house, meaning like what you have. A basement but without a basement, I mean I don’t know what you think of this idea? Crazy? \r\n\r\n01:16:06 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Honestly, I mean, I'm a specialist because he's an architect, so I don't understand these things, but I mean. No. I mean, I don't know if this method will work or not, because what cools the basement is the permanent clay, the permanent soil, the permanent soil, the soil is what cools it, because the soil is cold, it cools the reclaimed walls, and in this case the reclaimed walls are cold. \r\n\r\n01:16:37 BILAL \r\n. In the call phase, we started to be creative and have discussions, oh, so creative and nice, and I mean, I always mean, I'm an engineer by origin, and I have a background, I mean, I mean, I mean, creativity and thinking, and everything you talk about, and if an idea is possible, we can do I don't know what, but, this is not his job, now, this is his job now, he learns from you, yes and yes, I like this? The idea of planting, yes and I will do research on what? What's the benefit? Because B for... It means cost, and someone puts $5 into it and returns the interest as a hobby. Maybe he puts $20 into a plant at home and enters the house happy. What does that mean? What does an oven mean? Come on, $20 will bring you $20. You'll get a house and a razor. Maybe it's a little cooler, a little bit cooler. I mean, yes, the air is cleaner. Maybe you won't get sick because the plants also benefit from these things. \r\n\r\n01:17:34 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Even psychologically, it returns \r\n\r\n. 01:17:35 BILAL \r\n. I mean, maybe if we bring these ideas with biophilia into the training, it's good. I mean, we can make people who maybe don't always think about wanting to build a house, a green house, meaning solar energy and solar panels. We're trying to expand the idea a little and bring these ideas. \r\n\r\n01:17:54 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. The model is on this page, which the Iraqi engineers implemented exactly. They put all kinds of plants on the ground, cigars and ornamental plants \r\n\r\n01:18:05 BILAL \r\n, with everything, I mean. The last question, I had an idea. In the project, we would have people, I mean, all day long, learn things, but then apply them in a model that they will make. So, on the first day, we would tell them, you have a house, Khaled, Khaled is married with two children, and he is going to build here and he has 150 square feet. Think about it. And every time we learn something, it is worth applying it in this house. Khaled. If it weren't for the day after day of education, it's not just about them, meaning they will learn. There is a stage of the lesson that we will give them, maybe an hour and a quarter, an hour and a bit, so that they can take the ideas and apply them on a new map. And on the last day, we will do something like a map presentation for the class, for the trainers, and they will go to the market. We will try to invite all the offices to see the idea that I had, that it wouldn't be a fake person, that he went to the offices from the beginning, and we will tell them to give us one of the houses that you need, design it, and remove the name, and we only want the details of it, and we will make this immortal so that in the end, honestly, design a house for someone in the market, meaning in the market, one of the offices that needs it will design a house. If he likes all the ideas, he will take it. Do you think this is an idea? How do you fix it so that it is better? \r\n\r\n01:19:46 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nI mean, I feel it's correct, especially if, for example, we start by setting a budget and working on a high level, for example, to calculate exactly what the customer will cost. On the contrary, it will come out as a really good idea. And if, for example, there are people who help us imitate the cost and get the same result after \r\n\r\n01:20:04 BILAL \r\n. It's better to have a discussion between people. So, not every person is an individual. Each individual in the class is \r\n\r\n01:20:09 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. No, for example, they suggest something good for more, better, and more. For example, the budget should be less, but not at the expense of quality. \r\n\r\n01:20:17 BILAL \r\nYou just quit young, heichi slip duris. Design and then? Presentation, and discussion that today I learned this and for Khaled I thought that when two children need I don't know what we learned about the garden, maybe the garden is something like this and they present it and the whole class tries to help, how can we summarize it? This won't work for Khaled. Khaled will say no, because Khaled, I mean his material is small, so he can't come in. What's good then? \r\n\r\n01:20:50 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Exactly even, because even the garden that we have to keep clean, I mean the water in the indoor garden, or do we have to keep it clean in a certain way, we have to make it like a filter, even if for example because it's not a real garden, it's a miniature garden, so we need to maintain it, and your water ratio is appropriate so that you don't die, we have to discuss all of these plants \r\n\r\n01:21:18 BILAL \r\nin it yeah yeah. This will come up in the discussion, so it's good, because there are two things, or I like people to come up with ideas and think and do research on Instagram, online, and I don't know what else, and then implement them in a real project. What do they imagine? That this is not an application, there is a possibility, maybe small, but there is a real possibility that it will be implemented, meaning if the project owner comes on the last day and he comes to do the money, he gives it grades for each project, he says this, this project, I mean what we want to work on, I like this idea, let's implement it, and maybe for people who don't have work, this will be the first, I mean they call it a portfolio and put it in their files. I completed something that was applied at home, so it will be training, but training is a bit different, because it has reality in the market, and reality in application for people, God willing. So if you like this model, this way of thinking, what do you expect in the five days at all? \r\n\r\n01:22:23 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Did you like it? Honestly \r\n\r\n01:22:25 BILAL \r\nAnd the five days, what do we do with them? The first day, what do we do with the second day? I mean, maybe the education that we will provide? There are these modeling days, two modeling days, maybe a day for the garden, a day for the windows, if I don't know, I mean, do you have an idea about the five days \r\n\r\n01:22:41 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nWe need, for example, time to ask, for example, to let them work on the same programs, yes, even if they are the ones that slow down the simulation for the houses, so is it necessary that we pay attention to this time? A picture with the with which I mean with my graduation project, even they will see this later \r\n\r\n01:23:04 BILAL \r\nYou added to me on WhatsApp, yeah, yeah, but if I put the battery in, it will run out, yeah, but yeah, you mean, yeah, the five days, do you have an idea for them, yeah, the idea, yeah, the model \r\n\r\n01:23:21 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nWe can make it sketchy, yeah, even if I don't give you a heads up now, even if I forget something, maybe I can still, for example, arrange the schedule exactly for them, and even like yeah, yeah, I go back and see which programs are suitable for them, like which one is the easiest one for beginners, like yeah, let's say, so we can go back and use it and explain it, so I can make the schedule exactly on the same yeah, yeah, what's the order for our requirements? \r\n\r\n01:23:52 BILAL \r\nYeah? If you want to think about it a little, I will think about it a little. One of the ideas is that we think about the house in general, where is it? One possibility as a designer is that he can introduce ideas of money, any money, money, any sustainability into the walls. And then it's permissible. There's sun, there's wind. There's any insulation, and so on, I mean, first of all, it's permissible that we can both do this thing. What I like is that we see the old houses and how they were built, and why? So we take all the reasons, and then every day \r\n\r\n01:24:32 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. In the past, they didn't leave the facades outside, so the whole openness is inside the house, like now the houses that they designed, the divorce that \r\n\r\n01:24:40 BILAL \r\n. In Baghdad \r\n\r\n01:24:40 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. The engineer, you mean, is this the idea that we should return to, right? The arrow, I mean, and this is the most appropriate thing for our environment, but there are also those who insist on wanting appearances and such, and confronting it is very important to them, so that's why they lose more \r\n\r\n01:24:56 BILAL \r\nDo you know what a facade is? Can we put something like a TV screen for it? I don't know what? Hahaha so there's no doubt what they want a facade for, what do you mean a big window only, I mean guys \r\n\r\n01:25:09 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nHahaha \r\n\r\n01:25:10 BILAL \r\nYes, but I mean there's a possibility, you know what? It could be decoration, I mean Islamic, light rock, not anything else. But for the sake of appearance, this facade could be nice and the rest of the things are things like new, modern materials and I don't know what else. So this facade idea we need to discuss because it's not... I feel that this is one of the main reasons why people don't use methods that have the idea of sustainability, because they want to show the world that they have money and they have a big window, I mean, \r\n\r\n01:25:41 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Exactly \r\n\r\n01:25:42 BILAL \r\non this. So what if we can tell them no, show people that you have money and you have taste, put up a big painting, a painter, a great artist. A well-known name, I don't know, so we need to exchange, exchange this big window that it has, all these negative things, and we say what will this interface be? What? \r\n\r\n01:26:09 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. I mean, for me, trust means a channel in any way, but I mean, the only problem is that even the owner of the office discusses between me and this guy, I mean, he might not agree, or for example, he only agrees to the mods of Balk M, but in reality, he will not implement anything, who will you tell him, because he means, you know what they might gain from these interfaces, I mean, you gain as a job, yes \r\n\r\n01:26:34 BILAL \r\nIf not, why, what color? No, it did not come down? \r\n\r\n01:26:36 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. An expensive window, for example, is covered with materials. Uh, the window is definitely expensive, especially if it's double-glazed. That means a meter with a liter can reach $80 or more. Umm, so it's like this. So, it produces notebooks. Hahaha, as we say. Hahaha. I think \r\n\r\n01:26:52 BILAL \r\n. The facade is not only harmful to the environment, the facade is expensive and harmful to the homeowner. \r\n\r\n01:26:58 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Exactly, if you have a window made, how much of the cost is your share, because the meter is expensive? Sometimes they bring, for example, a cheap window, just in style. I mean, no, it was just that the large window would remain. \r\n\r\n01:27:13 BILAL \r\n. Ha. What about the window? \r\n\r\n01:27:14 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. And then he misses it, and insects, and this is because it's not good, I mean, or not good, I mean \r\n\r\n01:27:19 BILAL \r\nYes, and the heat is the most important thing in the end. This, I expect, I don't know if we will solve it in this call, but maybe this discussion will be inside the training, because this is one of the things that he wants to be one of the most important days in dealing with the customer, how do you make someone feel that you are together thinking about solving problems, not one against the other, this takes a percentage, you don't know what, no, no, I mean we are united to benefit you, and with this way of thinking we will benefit the environment, we will benefit the cost, we will benefit you personally, and I mean, you and I mean, an engineer, a psychologist and a doctor \r\n\r\n01:27:57 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nThe needs of the person who... \r\n\r\n01:27:59 BILAL \r\nGod willing, good, thank you for taking so long, but really, I mean, I had fun and benefited a lot, and God willing, you had fun too? \r\n\r\n01:28:06 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. Thank you, I mean, we had fun with you and they benefited from your information, and thank you very much for inviting me to this meeting \r\n\r\n01:28:13 BILAL \r\nGod willing, God willing, we will see you in July, and God willing, if. If it means it matches my schedules, the rest of them, I see that you are a very nice person, you help people to learn from you, with the figuring, the \r\n\r\nzilly \r\n\r\n, these things , \r\nI \r\nmean the \r\n... \r\n\r\nNo, I mean I have time, I mean I attend the lecture, but for example, if I have time at night, I will write it down with the names of the moderators and send them all a message. After that, for example, I want to work on a topic so that I can see which one we can benefit from the most and I will commit. I mean, I don’t want to send any \r\n\r\n01:29:01 BILAL \r\nAre there any people who mean the details? Yes, exactly, it’s not that quick, and it helps us do this financial equation? \r\n\r\n01:29:11 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nFor example, is a free relationship, right? \r\n\r\n01:29:14 BILAL \r\nYes. And in the end, it helps us calculate the material, the cost of the house, because we know what might absorb heat, and we know what might be needed in excess of the energy to counter this. The free absorption is \r\n\r\n01:29:30 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nMaybe these programs don’t show the budget, I mean, how much money can be spent? \r\n\r\n01:29:35 BILAL \r\nIs it possible? \r\n\r\n01:29:36 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. It helps you exactly, for example, that you know the real house simulation or, for example, if he made half of it and half of the heat, for example, we can bear it before. According to the hardest worker, it costs us less, for example, for half or for example, less than half, like this \r\n\r\n01:29:53 BILAL \r\nWhen you have time, if you can, for example, when you decide on the program, you definitely have files, for example, with two different houses, choose one that will have no hobby, for sustainability ideas, and one that has sustainability ideas, and give me a screenshot so we can see what we can interpret from it, what are the numbers, I mean \r\n\r\n01:30:13 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. What's its name? I will try to design it because, as I told you, I have worked with all the clients, meaning it is difficult for them to implement my ideas. I will be one of the solutions. I will be the one who presents all my ideas in it, so that you know that I will be more distinctive than he is the client, but no, this means that everything will be for the benefit or interest of the client. \r\n\r\n01:30:37 BILAL \r\nIt is good that this will be the traditional one. Let it be, I mean, among the 150. At 200 feet, and a quarter house means it is worth, I mean the atmosphere is connected. And the average means, is the expensive expensive or not? I mean, he doesn't have money to do anything, so look for an average, appropriate size, and let's do it, until we start doing the training, and if you want this surplus, its amount is according to its capacity, go download it, apply it, change it, this means it has a lot of benefits and you will see them and we will use it during the days, so it will be everything, I mean, it will benefit us in the training, we will have something like this, I mean, like a structure, we can, each one, I mean, he may make it bigger or smaller, or he may add and change to the, ah, his cup, I mean, Khalid's, his \r\n\r\n01:31:27 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nYes, I mean, for example, one treats the interface with, I mean, for example, with plants, or one leaves a material or any one, there are many solutions, or for example, we just use sun breakers, yes, I mean, there are more than one comment, yes, God willing, God willing, God willing \r\n\r\n01:31:42 BILAL \r\nGod. Anfal, thank you, thank you so much, and may God bless you. I mean, you participated with me and you spent time with me, a hobby. But I also benefited and I was happy, and I will see you in Mosul, God willing, in July at least during the days we have together. And God willing, you will complete this project from home, and it is important training. But I also encourage you to apply and to complete it in the way you work. With creativity, and the money, the company’s money, the design, and your office, God willing. And I mean, I don’t know how, if I don’t have money, a hobby, but I have a conviction that you are the person that Mosul needs for its homes and for its future? \r\n\r\n01:32:30 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nBut it's enough that someone knows that I've done something useful. I mean, there are people, the opposite, for example, you always dream, for example, hahaha \r\n\r\n01:32:38 BILAL \r\nNo, no, you dream, okay, but always one, I mean, I'm like you, I always dream, but I have people on the team with me, for whom? I work with them, they take me from the dream to reality, so one of the things that encouraged you, how do you get a little bit closer to reality? Do this window, for example, in the two months, do the Laser Clear and do it. I mean, a young man, do it, do it in something, I mean, quickly and lacking in existing materials, and don't do it, move it on the? \r\n\r\n01:33:08 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. I mean, fixed according to the sun's rays, \r\n\r\n01:33:12 BILAL \r\nYes, on the hottest day, and the hottest time of the sun. Fix it like this, so that it will be more effective the rest of the year. And do it, it doesn't mean don't say this is an idea I did in college, but put it in the room and benefit from it, and so that you know the difference, and maybe put some statistics, what was the temperature yesterday? And what is the temperature today, God willing ? \r\n\r\n01:33:35 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\nGod willing, I will try it right away? You encouraged me hahaha yes \r\n\r\n01:33:37 BILAL \r\n. Come on, I'm coming, come in July, so you have some time, I mean if you can and the Mussal Specchi will help you, yes \r\n\r\n01:33:46 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. I have a curtain design that will be finished in October, so I tried, God willing, sister, if for example I have to take a week off now, then we will see, God willing \r\n\r\n01:34:00 BILAL \r\n. God willing, thank you, now, if you see the WhatsApp messages that you sent me. This is really cool, but I mean, this is for research. I want to see this thing. If someone sees it on your window, he'll say, \"I want one.\" Sell it to us . \r\n\r\n01:34:17 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. I made it from, shall we say, cheap materials. It cost me $250, so. And they're really simple materials, but the sensor, the device, was expensive, so I couldn't spend more, so that's why we made it out of cardboard and so on. The back material, acrylic, so this is not a nice shape, but it means that the shape \r\n\r\n01:34:38 BILAL \r\nis not nice, no, its shape is very nice, and I mean, I mean, it is something, I mean, honestly, someone would be proud to say that yes, this is an Iraqi unit that did it, yes, so the thing is, I mean, what I really liked and that I always try to include in the oh, the subjects that we are trained in is that we must have confidence in our religion, our history, and our Iraqi and Musalawi identity, that we had ideas and so on and knowledge and experience and we forgot about it with imitation in \r\n\r\n01:35:13 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. No, it is impossible for me, I mean, why is it impossible for me to give up? Why? I told you that I will create my own office, because I don't want anyone to break me or diminish me, I mean the things that I love to do, so who am I? I will be the manager and I will have my own office. No one will tell me no. I told him yes, me yes, hahaha \r\n\r\n01:35:31 BILAL \r\n. And then you find the client and make it happen, you know? Between the dream and the bag \r\n\r\n01:35:37 ANFAL YATHRIB \r\n. But I will take the clients who work in the same style as me. It is not necessary to take all the clients. In the end, I am \r\n\r\n01:35:42 BILAL \r\n. This is the best thing. You know, when someone trains a group of people, I mean engineers and valves, and he will make each one of them say that he is her or what is her method, and they will find clients who are compatible with her. He has to say, what? No, there is no hobby. The market is crowded. No, if everyone focuses on their own way, they will find the people who will get along with them, God willing. Good, God willing. Come on, see you, God willing. Peace be upon you. Thank you for everything. Goodbye, good bye. Bye. Bye."

And there's, not I can God \r\n\r\n00:01:35 WIFAQ AHMED . \r\nThank you \r\n\r\n00:01:36 BILAL \r\n. The lighthouse \r\n\r\n00:01:37 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I don't know Kamel, my picture is clear to you \r\n\r\n00:01:41 BILAL \r\nNo, look, yes, a lamp and a candle and how many books? \r\n\r\n00:01:46 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Okay? Okay? I don't know \r\n\r\n00:01:51 BILAL \r\n. Yes, I don't know \r\n\r\n00:01:54 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I see you clearly. Behind you, praise be to God. Natural logic, very nice \r\n\r\n00:01:59 BILAL \r\n. Covered \r\n\r\n00:02:01 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nNo, no, the camera isn't covered, but, oh. Awani? Oh, I don't know. Is there a problem with the camera? Okay? Okay, okay. An integrated camera, okay? How are you? \r\n\r\n00:02:29 BILAL \r\nProfessor, thank God, how are you? How are you? \r\n\r\n00:02:31 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. God bless you. May God protect you. Welcome. I'm honored to have you, by God. \r\n\r\n00:02:36 BILAL \r\n. So, what's his name? I mean, I'm in France now, and you're in Mosul \r\n\r\n. 00:02:43 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes. \r\n\r\n00:02:44 BILAL \r\n. No, Anna, the last time I was in Mosul, it was a while ago, maybe five months, something like that, but thank God I liked it. The last time, really, I visited and I heard that they opened the Al-Nouri Mosque. \r\n\r\n00:03:00 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. The Grand Mosque, and the Prophet Yunus Mosque will open within a month, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:03:09 BILAL \r\nIt will open before I come, yes, so that we can finish work after, yes, half a month, seven, so God willing, Friday prayers. \r\n\r\n00:03:18 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Welcome, welcome, we are waiting for you and you will visit us, God willing. Thank you, thank you. \r\n\r\n00:03:26 BILAL \r\nYou know Abdullah, right? Abdullah is the one who asked us. From the Space season, how did it happen? \r\n\r\n00:03:33 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nMy friend and colleague, we have, the idea is that Abdullah is very active in Mosul Space, may God protect him, praise be to God, and we had an activity a month ago, not to mention two weeks ago, right, because I founded a club for a cultural leader in Mosul, right? \r\n\r\n00:03:53 BILAL \r\n. Nice . \r\n\r\n00:03:54 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. What's its name? It's called Anqaf Cultural Club, a club within the Mosul Heritage Foundation. The name of the foundation is EFA. A club for a cultural leader that hosted what? What is it? \r\n\r\n00:04:14 BILAL \r\n. They meet in Mosul Space Joy where you have \r\n\r\n00:04:18 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes, also, I was a lecturer at A and coordinator of the session, Professor Abdullah \r\n\r\n00:04:25 BILAL \r\n. Sweet \r\n\r\n00:04:25 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nAnd at the same time, so you know, Professor A, that I, the A. A. Before, Professor Bilal, I had a discussion interview before. About five days ago, I was in Turkey, and I had an interview regarding a project in Beit, yes. Which is the laser? \r\n\r\n00:04:56 BILAL \r\nOkay? \r\n\r\n00:04:56 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I think so. We registered for it. He said I registered for it about eight months ago. Yes, it seems to be in the situation hahaha. Professor Mustafa and Clara, I think from Switzerland, Lara \r\n\r\n00:05:12 BILAL , met me \r\n. I don't know, Clara \r\n\r\n00:05:14 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. E. E. W. A? And also someone from the Erbil office of African origins. It was, by God, a nice discussion, and I was in shorts, thank God, we are three candidates \r\n\r\n00:05:24 BILAL \r\n. Good luck \r\n\r\n00:05:25 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. May God protect you, my dear professor \r\n\r\n00:05:28 BILAL \r\nIf, if, if does it work? \r\n\r\n00:05:30 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nNo, by God, I was b. b. I mean, a scientific trip to Turkey regarding the ah and some details. It took about 8 days and I came back. The site will be in Mosul , God willing. \r\n\r\n00:05:45 BILAL \r\nGod willing, God willing, in the. In the work with ITC, yes, it's nice that this is my first time working with them, but like I said, they always take a long time with the contracts, because they work with the United Nations, and the, I mean, they are big, even, yes, things move, so don't be afraid if they take a long time, this is very normal, no, it's normal, and God willing, it's good. Good luck, Zain. May God keep you safe, my dear. I don’t have to explain a lot to you. We are trying to find a connection between the youth and the labor market and construction, experience, and that’s it. I was going to ask about the project so we can get to know each other and explain it to you, but you explain it to me, hahaha. \r\n\r\n00:06:30 WIFAQ AHMED. \r\nI mean, I read this project completely at the time of application, and also before the interview. It is a very pioneering project and its timing is correct. I mean, now the world, especially in Iraq, we are heading towards clean energy and green culture, Glen Birding and all these things. Yes, the time came, because the state came to support it and the need became high and the electricity shortage was very high, so now the time has come, thank God, in the previous years, I mean during the last eight years, almost, most of my focus was on this field, and arrangement, because I was \r\n\r\n00:07:19 BILAL \r\nYes, I mean. I mean, now let me tell you quickly about myself, I am Bilal, yes, by God, America, my family left in the eighties to study and we kept him outside the country. I was raised in Michigan, but I always had a desire to work in Iraq and do my service in Iraq, and thank God, these opportunities came to me. I worked with ITC since 2012. I was working, with the guys regarding the purchase. Mosul Space, I have known Saleh since 2014. We met B. B. What is its name in Erbil? recoded I love these projects because one doesn't wait to go and ask the government to make, I mean, yes, change during, but rather a revolution in the streets. I mean, I started with the Arab revolution. I said, \"Guys, let's find me to do things.\" Let's grow up with them. We looked at the creativity, programming, and, yes, the openness of projects. \r\n\r\n00:08:22 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. They benefit \r\n\r\n00:08:24 BILAL \r\n. The person at the same time, God willing. So, I mean, I started as a programming engineer, and I mean, a robot, and I ended \r\n\r\n00:08:35 WIFAQ AHMED . \r\nYes, I was? \r\n\r\n00:08:37 BILAL \r\n. I think that if I wanted to solve a problem, I would make a robot for God, for messengers. Industry, I mean, \r\n\r\n00:08:44 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n00:08:45 BILAL \r\n. How can we explain and see? I mean, through electronic devices and cameras, this is glass, this is iron, this is paper, and I don't know what else? Even people throw away the garbage, and robots do it. Yes, this was my job, and if it was. It might have taken me ten years, but if I come and teach 100 people, maybe a portion of them are the ones who will start thinking that they can solve problems. I mean, see that the way the interaction is greater is if someone thinks that he creates an environment for creativity, not innovates himself. So this changed my direction, and I started studying. I did a Master's degree in teaching and education in 2020, and now I want to focus on something, I don't know how to think about it, but that. People must not always say that the people must change their mentality. People must change. I mean, awareness must not exist. I don't know . \r\n\r\n00:09:56 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nWhat? \r\n\r\n00:09:58 BILAL \r\n. Yes, I swear. I feel that if you give a hammer to someone who is not smart, clever, and polite, he will build you a nice house. If you give a hammer to someone who is not smart, not polite, he will cause you a problem. \r\n\r\n00:10:12 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. F. A. \r\n\r\n00:10:13 BILAL \r\nI started to feel that all these things that we do, the A, I mean the implementation of the youth and giving them money and training, we must at the same time know what the color is, but actions are based on intentions, how do they know that I fixed it? What is the meaning of something? When we see the impact, the A, I mean the result of the A, creativity sometimes on social media now, look at its problems with Instagram and I don't know what a hundred people \r\n\r\n00:10:39 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nWhat happened? \r\n\r\n00:10:40 BILAL \r\n. So one must know what to do? And what is his hand? Right? Even someone who does fun now, I do it here, and I have a company in Lebanon called Bloom, we take people and train them on business and work \r\n\r\n00:10:56 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nSecond? \r\n\r\n00:10:57 BILAL \r\nProm, I mean like a rose. Yes, and the second thing, if I did it with ITC, and the reason for this call, and the calls that I do, I want to understand, I mean from people, yes yes, we have these devices, right, we have the concept, I mean if one yes, the goal of it is both things, right, at the same time that people say job opportunities, and at the same time we benefit from the job opportunity within the framework of green construction, right? So? \r\n\r\n00:11:32 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nCorrect? \r\n\r\n00:11:34 BILAL \r\n. Abu Ihtmal, people need one skill specifically for solar because it has support for people looking for it, I mean, it has a movement that has become insulation, no, you give people knowledge of this, but the market is not there, people who don't \r\n\r\n00:11:48 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n? \r\n\r\n00:11:49 BILAL \r\n. Contact them? I mean? Come on, seriously, the walls that need insulation. No. No. They come. Come on, I need personal energy, so I need work for it, but the thing that I expect we will talk about today is the A. The third aspect is the A that came, I take opinions from you, the market is ready for green ideas during the construction of houses, again, or the reconstruction of houses, and yes, I mean, information is discovered from people who are in the FEED M, and I try to organize it and see where, I mean, what can we do? We give people teachers, I don't know how they got in from scratch, I mean engineering graduates, architecture graduates, but what can we do for these graduates so that when they enter the job market, they have the ones who will find them \r\n\r\n00:12:47 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. It will happen \r\n\r\n00:12:49 BILAL \r\n. I mean, it has the idea of sustainability. So this. So you will know where I come from? And why is there? And if \r\n\r\n00:12:58 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nyou want? \r\n\r\n00:12:58 BILAL \r\n. Tell me a little about yourself, I'm \r\n\r\n00:13:00 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nGod bless you. God willing, of course the first thing is that I am really honored to know you, Professor Bilal. And yes, frankly. This is a good opportunity, that we reflect. I mean, almost by God's grace, I have diagnosed most of the. The problems and I'm working, and with most of these details during this opening period. First of all, I am a general civil engineer, MA, graduated in 2004, so I have been in the profession for about 21 years, and before that I was also working in this sector, which is the construction sector, meaning that a student can work, yes. But in the year 2000 and approximately eight, I transferred some of the... Yes, I noticed that there was a problem regarding the... Yes, so I had the opportunity to work in an industrial facility, so I had a kind of challenge, which is... Yes, to get to... The latest experiences in Makh regarding furnace and pipe line insulation, the process is almost a process, I mean industrial engineering, I mean what I'm talking to you now is Morse Dean, it's not a service, it has no connection to society, but these are the ones that I looked into at the time and implemented. They were very successful in these industrial facilities that I worked on, and one of the successes was that they removed a thermal capsule. Its temperature during operation reached about 900 to 1000 degrees Celsius. So its insulation required a second stage called acylary removal. That is, the products that enter the capsule turn into argillaceous until it cools again, or a second crushing process occurs. In general, the issue is a bit complicated, yes, but when I worked \r\n\r\n00:15:05 BILAL \r\n. This is research, I mean, engineering in college, if \r\n\r\n00:15:09 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. No, no, this. This. This is in the field, a project. A project. An outlet. \r\n\r\n00:15:13 BILAL \r\n. I mean, is it in these houses? I'm trying to imagine the table. What are these walls like, oh device? Yes, they're very high, where? Where would you find them in the house? Yes? \r\n\r\n00:15:23 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes, this is this, I mean, the seed of the a the a. My experience with it, frankly, is that they call it a reformer. A reformer is what they use to reform natural gas. They separate the materials, they break the natural gas, or they break it, they break it. It then enters a heat exchanger. \r\n\r\n00:15:46 BILAL \r\n. Yes, \r\n\r\n00:15:48 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. This thermal principle was with the oxyhelix. So, there was a really big problem, yes, I don't know, professor, do you hear me? Yes, okay, so the problem was with the oxyhelix, which is the main thermal principle, the excitation? By the grace of God, I trained the young men of the work team, and I was able to isolate it by 300% of the \r\n\r\n00:16:23 BILAL \r\nThe line was cut off for a while. How much did it cost? \r\n\r\n00:16:29 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n300% of the design condition, three times. Yes, F. So after that, the auxiliary was cancelled, they didn't need it at all, they moved on to the next stage, because the result was excellent, and with materials, of course, of course, scientific in the process, of course, there was a person before me who was an expert, his religion was Jewish from Iraq, and his movements were under the control of the state, and he was the only expert, but God facilitated that I received a file of papers and transferred it to this process, so I had a focus on the process I knew what, meaning do we save energy or save expenses, save the economic situation, yes, and also the service visit, and then the building materials that are special \r\n\r\n00:17:36 BILAL \r\n.and the line cuts off for a while \r\n\r\n00:17:40 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I apologize, I think I have a problem with the internet. Anyway, what's up with you? I'll try? I'll turn off my camera, professor, please until \r\n\r\n00:17:49 BILAL \r\n. At least we saw you nice \r\n\r\n00:17:51 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. May God protect you. My dear. May God keep you safe. The materials that were available in the local market, in addition to the general side of the state, I mean you know the security situation, the economic situation, etc., all of this did not help in the introduction of modern materials, we have M. But, yes, after the climate became extreme, people returned \r\n\r\n00:18:13 BILAL \r\n, I mean its name means, where are these modern materials? Do you need to import them to do these things, or locally, I mean, how? \r\n\r\n00:18:25 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nThe materials regarding insulators for industrial facilities, of course, these are the ones that come from America, Italy, and Japan. Okay, these are regarding industrial facilities, most of which are products of alumina compounds. And its insulation, I mean, of course, everything from a meter to a measurement, for example, five millimes, yes, that's an insulation factor, six millimes is different from seven millimes, it's very expensive, but it is, yes, I mean, this was a wonderful experience, yes, it's nice, but in houses, in houses, I mean, we're talking about the simplest thing, false ceilings didn't enter in a way that they became widespread until about 2012 approximately, yes, most of the construction, it was classic, it was, I mean, without any insulation, considering that they didn't think about energy, yes, the spaces that \r\n\r\n00:19:22 BILAL \r\ndiffer, why, why did they change? \r\n\r\n00:19:25 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. What changed in 2012 is that there was some degree of security stability, there was economic prosperity, I mean the price of a barrel of oil was good, and people were somewhat relieved after the difficult years of civil war and terrorism, so this was reversed, I mean the situation is balanced between people's needs and the security situation, laws, and stability of sovereignty. All of this is working \r\n\r\n00:19:58 BILAL \r\n. Any problem means people import goods or. No, before this it was \r\n\r\n00:20:03 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Honestly. Honestly, before that, Professor, before that, imports were very little, because where do you have your ports? They come from? They either come from Jordan or Turkey, and a little from Syria, and the majority come from the port, including a few from Basra. So, the materials that are transported are transported from Basra to the capital. Yes, it's almost secure to some extent, but you can't distribute it to all of Iraq because of the security situation. The state of civil war \r\n\r\n00:20:34 BILAL \r\n. I mean \r\n\r\n00:20:37 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Exactly, exactly, actually, it was restricted to Basra, and we had problems, we had materials that were spoiled inside the containers at the port, and the merchant who, for example, imported them from Mosul or Anbar couldn't go to receive them because of the threats. It was destroyed, and also the government departments were suffering from it, I mean even the authorized employee who walks with security forces also fears for himself, but those days are gone and thank God and may God not bring them back, because they were very difficult days, yes, of course, amen regarding 2012, the price of a barrel was good, yes, the salaries were good, the security situation was good, and you lived a simple life, its duration was approximately two years, 11. 12. Yes, 2013 came, political problems began, 2014 came, this one entered, the problem with ISIS and not ISIS until 2017. We had a very big transition, I mean, 2018. The consumer’s style or taste changed. Yes, the consumer, the consumer \r\n\r\n00:21:46 BILAL \r\n. Window \r\n\r\n00:21:46 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Big. Yes. Hahaha on \r\n\r\n00:21:48 BILAL \r\n. On the sun, yes \r\n\r\n00:21:51 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nWhen does someone who wants to buy or build a house try to calculate? He calculates the angle of the sun, he calculates the size of the windows, he calculates the direction of the wind, he calculates, yes, whether his air conditioner is working, if it's not working, how many amperes will it be enough to draw? Of course, solar energy to some extent. I was a correspondent for an Egyptian agency, yes, considering that it was a regional country, Egypt was producing and distributing solar panels and systems. I'm talking in 2009, yes, but in 2018. There are not a few people who started to design or build their own houses. The transition happened. So the work of the architect increased. I mean, the architect before that didn't have a role, for many years, he tells you about 20 years. Yes, the architect, after that, no, he entered forcefully, with his strength, experience, and taste, and it didn't happen. We have schools, I mean, the classical school, the square school, the structural and shell school, these are the schools of. Who imposes on the homeowner to design the right design? And make the house serviceable, okay? \r\n\r\n00:23:08 BILAL \r\n. You say schools, I mean people who didn't graduate went and came back for courses \r\n\r\n00:23:15 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nYes. No, no, excuse me, excuse me, architectural schools, I mean yes. Taste, I mean fashion? \r\n\r\n00:23:28 BILAL \r\nOkay? \r\n\r\n00:23:29 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I mean, architectural fashion has changed. Previously, the facade was a simple, classic stone block, yes, yes. Yes \r\n\r\n00:23:39 BILAL \r\nSorry, the line isn't that strong. These fashions learned it, I mean, each person according to his own taste, if there is anything, what does that mean? \r\n\r\n00:23:50 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nDo you mean consumers? \r\n\r\n00:23:52 BILAL \r\nThe A I mean, consumers learn it from the architects, surely not? \r\n\r\n00:24:04 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nWhat professor? \r\n\r\n00:24:06 BILAL \r\n. Bilal \r\n\r\n00:24:07 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Hello Professor Bilal, yes \r\n\r\n00:24:08 BILAL \r\n. Go ahead, brother \r\n\r\n00:24:10 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Hariri \r\n\r\n00:24:11 BILAL \r\n. Notes. And then, we didn't interrupt you. The sound is very \r\n\r\n00:24:14 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Strong \r\n\r\n00:24:14 BILAL \r\nQuestions at the end? \r\n\r\n00:24:17 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nWhat are you even discussing? The problem of weak internet access? Iraq is heading towards covering all residential areas in the governorates with the state-supported fiber optic cable. The Wi-Fi is putting pressure on the lines until its service is reduced, so people are even coming to the fiber optic cable. How do I apologize? I mean, the issue is from the source, almost all the work comes to be done. Ah, and your question regarding people, how did you know? Ah, these architectural styles or schools, you know, Iraq has schools, I mean, it has many architects, some of them are old, some of them are not so new, and then the power of the internet made people look at experiences, especially after the displacement, those who were displaced to Turkey, those who were displaced to Jordan, those who were displaced to other governorates like the Kurdistan region. The groups began to spread because people saw what it means for your home to be respectable and tidy, and at the same time, efficient, I mean, yes, okay? \r\n\r\n00:25:26 BILAL \r\nBut \r\n\r\n00:25:27 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Working now. Yes \r\n\r\n00:25:29 BILAL \r\n. What convinces people the most is dealing with other people who see what the neighbors want to do, it's not convincing, I mean, one of the things we think about in training is that someone must be able to convince people during the A, saving money, and say that if you don't pay for oil, then my country is not my country, generator, don't be afraid, I mean \r\n\r\n00:25:53 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. So, we do \r\n\r\n00:25:53 BILAL \r\nThese are correct, but. But I mean, if I hear from a lot of people that people don't like to be the first one. I will do something that he wants to see, I mean he can't do it like my neighbors, I saw it at my cousin's house, I liked it, so it's a movement that has to be there and that's it, it has to be that this movement has started, \r\n\r\n00:26:13 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n100%, you're right, 100%, honestly, no, I mean 2020. Oh, or 2021, because Corona stopped the situation for about eight months in 2021. Oh, it was a good start, for insulation work inside homes in terms of the Oh, or the finishing work, meaning the homeowner started using cork insulation, Oh, and he uses insulation with Oh, gypsum board, he uses insulation with Oh, aluminum panels, Oh, and a lot of details changed in terms of people's tastes and uses, so it was a good recovery, especially for distributors of jackets and distributors of cooling systems EE. In 2023, the trend towards solar energy began. The trend, of course, is that in 2022-21, I implemented whatever it was, and I worked as a field consultant with them for five years. I implemented the first building. It is certificates. It is a green building. Its design was of course a challenge. We did not demolish it. It was hit by a missile during the bombing. It is located in the largest park on the right side of Mosul. Its area is about 67,000 square meters. \r\n\r\n00:28:00 BILAL \r\n. So this \r\n\r\n00:28:01 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nbuilding was in the form of a hall. We designed and insulated it and it was completely successful and took first place. Who? A specialized company, which I think one day I will introduce you to. My colleague was at one time an engineer, Basma Abdul Rahman, of Kisk Company. If you have heard of it . \r\n\r\n00:28:24 BILAL \r\n. Of course, yes. \r\n\r\n00:28:26 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nEngineer Basma, my colleague, because I implemented bridges in 2016. She was, what was she, the director of the Super Pfizer I have, and what was I, I mean, working in the private sector in bridges? Thank God, everything was, I mean, there was a high percentage of achievement and speed, and I mean, the condition was absolutely excellent. We got it from the FAO. The FAO was good in it, so an engineer, yes? \r\n\r\n00:28:54 BILAL \r\n. The engineers work, I mean, with UNDP and with UNESCO, so what do they work on a project like this, but it was \r\n\r\n00:29:04 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. They say \r\n\r\n00:29:05 BILAL \r\n. To me, there was always something like a conflict between people who want the heritage to look like heritage and stay on the walls, which is a meter, I mean, a full meter wide, and people \r\n\r\n00:29:18 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. They say no \r\n\r\n00:29:19 BILAL \r\nLet's use this new material with this aluminum I don't know what? The engineers who want to do things using ecology and modern things. How do you think about this topic? And what and where do you want to see the ah thinking, meaning the identity of the city and heritage and green building and sustainability, and its relationship with heritage and the things that come from it, whether it's the classic classic or squares and the trends that come to mind? \r\n\r\n00:29:52 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes, yes, this is a good question, Mr. Bilal. Well done to you. Honestly, in 2023, after my contract ended and it was Beta, I entered a competition for UNESCO. So the position was available to 150 engineers who applied for it, and I, praise be to God and thanks, came first in three stages of testing and signed a contract with UNESCO. So after that, yes, I worked in this sector, which is the heritage security maintenance sector, and yes, I received a project and prepared it. Thank God, we got it. I mean, I received an honor from the Director-General of UNESCO, Audrey Augellier, about four months ago, and the medal, meaning, because I preserved the heritage condition. Brother, the answer is, your question is regarding the heritage city or the old city of Mosul, for example. It is not qualified to be declared on the World Heritage List, and therefore, what governs, yes, the work inside this city are UNESCO policies, meaning, no external changes are allowed, no use of other materials is allowed, no change in the design, if the building is, for example, 150 to 200 years old, and there are other policies regarding the work of UNESCO. As for the modern constructions that are about 70 years old or more, not 70, but 50 years old or more, meaning from the seventies, frankly, these cannot be dealt with in a modern way, provided that they are located outside the scope of the old city, which we, I mean, I worked on in 2002, 2001, and 2002 on the urban planning of the old city, with an agreement between its completely different countries and UNESCO. So, the process, professor, we currently have in Mosul a project, which is the city expansion project, the plan that they call the plan. The planning, the foundation, the basic planning, or the master plan for the city, will push all of the city outwards to 7 km. This will provide us with new opportunities. Okay, Professor Bilal, can you hear me? Chad Bilat. Come on, listen to me, okay, okay, honestly, the city, as it pushes outwards, expanding to 7 km in all directions, will provide us with an excellent opportunity to start real construction, the reality of working with it according to solar energy equipment. It is likely to be more efficient than inside the city. For example, inside the city, I have few air currents, so the solar panels heat up a lot, meaning there will be a gap in their productivity and efficiency. As for the new open areas, if the state provides this in a real way, then of course, the work will happen and the jumps will happen. Each area has a visual identity like that adopted by any modern country in the world. You look and see that every neighborhood has a fingerprint, a shape, even a fingerprint, a color light from the outside, and the process is possible for us to reflect inside Mosul, considering this a new opportunity. As for the heritage, of course not. Here, approximately 13 circles are involved. The most important of these is the Antiquities and Heritage Inspectorate of the Ministry of Culture, which implements its policies to produce heritage buildings that could be included in UNESCO's World Heritage List \r\n\r\n00:34:10 BILAL \r\n. So this means that the government needs to be a bit strong so that there is, I mean, when they are built, but \r\n\r\n00:34:19 WIFAQ AHMED, \r\nwho will say? \r\n\r\n00:34:26 BILAL \r\n. What's wrong with his new son? It's a very nice and wonderful opportunity, but what color? Will we be able to make sure that the things that will be built \r\n\r\n00:34:34 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nEight? \r\n\r\n00:34:37 BILAL \r\n, so it has to be a government agency? \r\n\r\n00:34:40 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes? By God, Professor, I mean, this is one of my dreams. I think that a house project means yes, and it is possible that he takes this step. One of my dreams is that we implement the dead laws in the municipality. Also, this, this is one of the important things. There are dead laws that are not used. They exist. Also, it is possible that we amend the municipal law with regard to the architectural footprint of the building, with regard to fluidity, with regard to the width of the streets and the percentage of trees, and also the exterior design. Also, just as it exists in many cities, including Paris, including London, and even Germany, many countries are working to force the property owner to implement layers of insulation so that it is not affected, even if the building is heritage, it remains heritage from the outside, but from the inside there is very good moisture insulation and heat insulation, because in the end, the process is an economic process. It reduces energy consumption, especially electrical energy. \r\n\r\n00:36:04 BILAL \r\nI will tell you my idea. What training? Or even get your opinion? \r\n\r\n00:36:09 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nWhat do you mean? \r\n\r\n00:36:10 BILAL \r\n. May God make it better for me \r\n\r\n00:36:12 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nYes, you are welcome, yes, the idea? \r\n\r\n00:36:14 BILAL \r\n. What I noticed when I came to Mosul and saw the house \r\n\r\n00:36:17 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nA little far away please hello a little. Yes, now it's excellent, okay, very good, you can sing with it, well done, your voice is very nice, okay? \r\n\r\n00:36:27 BILAL \r\n. Sorry, I don't know why. Oh, this was the best of the problems, okay? I went to Mosul Heritage and thought about it, and I wanted to see the new buildings that were everywhere, they didn’t fit the location, they didn’t have the style of the buildings, they didn’t have anything that resembled the atmosphere, and people were putting windows, they didn’t have any insulation, and the air was coming in and they were occupying the space, and I mean, hahaha, I don’t know what kind of air it was, it needed a little bit of different thinking and then it would go away. \r\n\r\n00:37:06 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. \r\n\r\n00:37:07 BILAL You see \r\nthe people who mean by the houses of the al-al, meaning the history of Mosul, and you see that they thought of everything, every decoration, not only has meaning, and the shape has depth and benefit for people, and I started to learn, I mean from Dr. Bassam, and there are people who don’t have many books about the years, I started thinking, I mean the things, I mean the methods of sustainability, I want inside the Heritage Building, not only this, I want to take the Musalawi, so I think it’s true that we will do this training with B with a house, a house project, let’s not kill, and then it went, and like I told you, I was filled with engineers, and there was this conflict between one who wants to mean to remain historical, and the other wants to bring new materials, and I don’t know what, but in the end, it’s all history and the current architectural time, so if he focuses on me wanting to create a nice environment for someone I love, then this question then doesn’t matter to him. These methods are historical, if this means the present time, no, we go now, the training begins, the training begins, we go, we take architects, engineers, people who know how to design, and we walk around the city. We take notes on the houses, on the methods they used in history, we go to the market, the old city, we see all the things that are there after that, we go to the Mosul heritage house, we sit in the iwan, we sit in, I mean, and then we don’t explain to them the idea of the green house, we make them see that all heritage houses must have their methods, what about sustainability, because they don’t have electricity. That’s it, hahaha. They should have thought about it. How will this house be compatible with the current climate or location, and with the local materials, because they didn't have things coming from China, they didn't have these molds that came from far away, so the idea is that when I give them the information, we let them analyze it by exploring the city, they take pictures if it doesn't conflict, we definitely take pictures of the Mosul Heritage House or other places, the iwans, and we make a catalog of things that are beneficial to sustainability, and then we try to take from all these pictures and details, and we discuss as a group of engineers, we discuss with each other, and we come up with their methods, I mean not \r\n\r\n00:39:47 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nWhat? \r\n\r\n00:39:47 BILAL \r\nThe walls look like a meter. If the walls had this, no. We can use old materials, we can use new materials, but then you have to think about it. Sometimes there are other things you have to think about, like there are materials that have AV USS and NXXS spy army when they hit the sun, meaning settlements emerge from it and people get hurt by it, so we have to make sure, I mean a lot of things, but we study them and talk about them with each other, and try to learn from the past so that we can be the future later. The third part is training, and this part, God willing, will connect it with the local market, and God willing, the young men who go to enter the league will find a job, and T T, I mean, they will communicate with the job market, we will go to the profits, the design, we will ask them to give us the money or the projects that they have, it doesn’t have to be the names or anything, but I mean, the size of the house, where in Mosul, I mean its details, the number of residents, I don’t know what? Then we go to the same guys and tell them we've dried up the past, we went and saw all the methods and analyzed them for themselves. Now let's update it and see how we can take these designs. I mean, like you say, is there a hobby in language? I mean, methods and ideas for how? One wants to build and waves and every wave comes with its own form and I don't know what according to me, I want to try to see if we can make this training make people who dry up the past become the future, and then they make a drawing of a real house, and then we bring the aa the aa the people in the offices to be like a judge or a jack b hahaha so each one tells her that I learned this method \r\n\r\n00:41:41 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Hello, yes, yes, Professor Mohammed, no, I can't hear you. Ha \r\n\r\n00:41:45 BILAL \r\nOkay, so this idea is that they come, and then people say, I mean, the design tells them, and they say, who is the winner, who was the successful one, and if they really like the drawing, please take it. Hahaha, implement it and take it with you until it has some time, I mean, days, I mean, work and put it on the basis that we are doing something real in the world, I mean, it's his, ah, it's achieved. So this idea is simply that we learn from the past, we do it, I mean, we update it. It's not that we will build an Iwan of this size, yes, in the same way, but we have 150 square feet, because 100 square feet is enough to build a new house. How can we take the same methods and update them with the current reality? And then, design? It's related to the... the job market, so this is its training. I want you to tell me that this will work, this will not work, this is good, this is not good. Hahaha, let's see what you think, God willing? \r\n\r\n00:42:46 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nMay God keep you safe. May God protect you, of course. Yes, for your information, in 2024, I got, yes. A TE International certificate. I mean. And with it academic accreditation. Yes, my grade was B Mertz, yes, in the British system, I mean, it's higher than the F.A., so thank God, and now I have, yes, yes, engineering training? And my curricula are in... I understand you completely, professor. I mean, \r\n\r\n00:43:24 BILAL \r\n. I left. \r\n\r\n00:43:25 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I gave it all, I gave it all, we had exactly FD, I mean, yes, understanding and harmony on the issue, but. What happened, we had something similar to this in the experience, right? We were - I was the supervisor of the old project, so among our activities was conducting a study on 60 houses, and the same process: an architect, civil engineers, drawings, preparing bills of quantities, and controlling the rehabilitation processes. As for transforming this idea into modeling, we're modeling that takes into consideration the heritage condition, yes, the heritage condition, and adding insulating materials, and the method of energy conservation. This is a very, very nice idea, but honestly it requires effort. The most important thing is that it requires time, education, and effort. As for the time, of course, it depends on the duration of the house project, which I expect is more than a year. And, as for the education or the operations, regarding this detail, of course, it is possible that we must work on an awareness campaign, but not in a traditional way, or we must appear in a real way, meaning, we agree with companies or influential people, who have the ability to convey this idea to the simplest of things, like when we advertise juice, or advertise any product on TV, we advertise this thing, or so that it becomes a culture, or at least we plant the seed of culture, yes, there are a thousand of them. We are working in a professional manner, I think the most important names that you mentioned, meaning, Dr. A, what is his name, the architect? Dr. Basem? Of course, he is very wonderful, I mean, absolutely wonderful, and the rest of the young people are present, and yes, the architectural engineers are present, yes, the specialized engineers are present, and can we add to them? Oh, let's call it a supporting entity. I prefer it to be non-governmental. I prefer that private sector companies enter as supportive advisory companies. They give us an idea, for example, that this new product has been launched in the world, or that this product is currently in the testing phase, or there is a forum or symposium, for example, in Kazakhstan, or a symposium in Turkey, or a type of artificial marble. You know, these are the details we need. These are the raw materials that will eventually be transformed into a product. So if \r\n\r\n00:46:19 BILAL becomes \r\na number of people, and \r\n\r\n00:46:21 WIFAQ AHMED becomes a number \r\n. Oh, here. Yes, Mr. Pardon \r\n\r\n00:46:29 BILAL becomes a number \r\n. There has to be someone who goes with it, not just hears about it \r\n\r\n00:46:36 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Here we have, for example, yes, it is possible, I mean, if I leave what I have, yes, a meeting with the Prime Minister, a meeting with the Prime Minister, regarding this detail in the presence of the Minister of Industry. Yes, so that he can do with his factories, I mean, we had a very large factory, a thermal factory, as well as the Minister of Electricity, and also the Minister of Municipalities, I mean this. This, if we have the project, the important thing is that we make our voices heard, it appears in front of the media that we are supported by the state, and at the same time we work to provide a real service, we will have credibility and transparency. This. This high disaster, if we reach 60% from him, then we have succeeded third \r\n\r\n00:47:23 BILAL \r\n. I like it ok \r\n\r\n00:47:26 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nGod bless you. What about you? \r\n\r\n00:47:29 BILAL \r\nRight. Not just come, huh? How did this project complete a six-day training? I don't know what? On the basics? \r\n\r\n00:47:38 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. You know, Professor Bilal? Yes, I have, I mean, I read once when I was about 15 years old. One of the writers said that a painting, any beautiful painting, you see it and it asks you to look at it from the appropriate distance, I mean, you get really close to it, and you see, but there are strokes of color and brush strokes and something not nice, and if you move away, you lose the details. The appropriate distance currently is that no organization or any project or any initiative can succeed without state support. And the good thing about the issue currently is that the state, it is currently supporting and it is asking for it because we have a really big crisis regarding the energy sector. And we have not only worked on the energy sector, we mean if. Just the energy sector, things are easy, but we must provide a civilized model, civilized planning, provide services, ease the burden on people, right? I mean, from an economic perspective, they don't spend an extra amount on electricity, and at the same time, they start to realize that there is a rationalization of consumption, we have something, the world's service is developing in this direction. So, I think the process needs to be from this appropriate distance, so that we see the picture instead of seeing it as a puzzle piece, we don't see it as a whole. Yes. Yes, 90%, I mean, with you, I support the process with some modifications and taking the opinions of the committees or the youth who are present. \r\n\r\n00:49:08 BILAL \r\nI mean, I like this thinking, about the big goal and the steps to it. I mean, this is what we are doing over time, it won't be just one time of training, and that's it, it will be exactly, I mean, it will be counted \r\n\r\n00:49:27 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nor feedback, I mean \r\n\r\n00:49:32 BILAL \r\n. Not just the modern materials and the old materials, right? This idea must come out, it is not training, it is research into what we are doing, and guys, it is diverse \r\n\r\n00:49:44 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Perfect, perfect \r\n\r\n00:49:47 BILAL \r\n. Design guideline \r\n\r\n00:49:51 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nIs it possible, is it possible that everything is normal? \r\n\r\n00:49:59 BILAL \r\nAnd we see the new gum and we do it. We see where there is the same? \r\n\r\n00:50:08 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Is it possible? And then yes \r\n\r\n00:50:15 BILAL \r\nThis is with it, I mean, and everyone in the end we can do, I mean, we sign the Al and started Vern of the design guidelines. On it, and we bring the companies, I mean, in the end, when these, I mean, are talking about 16, I don't know what these are. Once we do it. And we show it to them, and we light it up for them, and we share it with them, and we leave them \r\n\r\n00:50:47 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Of course \r\n\r\n00:50:48 BILAL \r\n. In the atmosphere. And little by little. And you reach your big goal, which is the government and I don't know what, but during \r\n\r\n00:50:57 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. This \r\n\r\n00:50:59 BILAL \r\n. Because there is movement in it \r\n\r\n00:51:00 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nGo, is it possible? \r\n\r\n00:51:03 BILAL \r\n. What is there in the world and his idea, how do you solve a problem? This is living comfortably, a new house, built in this way, the new place, tangible for 7 kilometers, let's make a place for him to light up and his father, possibly a house that has a part of the project called a story house and behind the pilot house that they build the house that will be. Like a model for sustainable houses in the mosque, I don't know \r\n\r\n00:51:40 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Professor. Professor, I mean yes, I am. Excuse me, go ahead. Go ahead, after my words \r\n\r\n00:51:47 BILAL \r\n. Let's see if there is a way \r\n\r\n00:51:52 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Currently, the city. What does it have a group of projects? Residential Complex means the new residential neighborhoods. I mean Mosul. \r\n\r\n00:52:09 BILAL \r\nmeans Baghdad. How many years have they had them? \r\n\r\n00:52:12 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes, but if we invest, if we invest in the idea of expanding the city, then the investment license given to the investor must impose specifications on him. And this is the governing point. I must impose on the investor who builds me a residential neighborhood. That he uses it properly. And that is why the current trend, as far as I know, is to introduce solar energy, in addition to gas pipelines. It will be introduced to the new residential neighborhoods that are located on the new master plan, which is after the expansion. So if we can find one or two models. Of residential neighborhoods under. Yes, you do not expect their investment licenses except with proper insulation. This is an unprecedented success. This will make us a pioneer in this case. The second issue is that we must believe that we will make it happen. We have a long wait, and time is part of the treatment. It is not possible for me to take on a project that takes a year and honestly expect results. I mean, I need at least a... For people who are thinking of building their own houses, it has changed. I need a professor at least, 3 years. The reason is because during these three years, I can bring him... I mean a professor, I can bring him proof of this real work. Notice the temperature outside. When I go into the hall, it reads minus six or 8 degrees Celsius or more. Or I am currently suffering from a job, but the bank and the outside temperature... for example, 50 degrees Celsius. So there is a difference . \r\n\r\n00:54:13 BILAL \r\n. Architects tell me that someone is building a house that costs $100,000, and he says, \"No, you know, if you add insulation, it means the cost increases. It could be $2,000, $2,500. \" \r\n\r\n00:54:26 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. But in the summer \r\n\r\n00:54:27 BILAL \r\n. I mean. I mean it changes things completely, but \r\n\r\n00:54:33 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. They reject it \r\n\r\n00:54:35 BILAL \r\nAt least the house project is still a few years away from the project, God willing, and we are at the beginning of these important years, and \r\n\r\n00:54:46 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nI mean \r\n\r\n00:54:47 BILAL \r\nIt's a nice thing that we can work on this topic, this project, and God willing you will be with us, I mean let's see what happens with the contract? \r\n\r\n00:54:59 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yours, God bless you, I swear I believe in the young people in the group, that they have the ability, and you, praise be to God, you understand the topic from all sides. And I am here, God willing, with you, in what I mean, I hope to be a helpful element, God willing. Okay, Professor Bilal. Yes. As you wish \r\n\r\n00:55:34 BILAL \r\n. This is actually my \r\n\r\n00:55:36 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. My dear, as you wish. It's okay, it's okay. May God strengthen you. May God strengthen you. Take your time \r\n\r\n00:55:48 BILAL \r\n. Okay, good now, I had a question before this thought \r\n\r\n00:55:55 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n00:55:57 BILAL \r\nand this is important. People, I mean, we can help young people find job opportunities, but thank God, this is what we can claim in this way. Yes, like you say, focusing on it is important for anyone who does something with us. They must pay attention to these things, these new materials, and these old materials, these materials, the prices, and then they must know the difference, I mean, how is it possible to have a house without it, and what is a house with it, and they must feel that this should be the first time we do this training, someone brings it with what color, someone who is convincing, this is one of the things, about the training method that if this is what comes out of the calls that it is necessary \r\n\r\n00:56:54 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. One, yes \r\n\r\n00:56:58 BILAL \r\nI want to sell you this solar energy, to bring you electricity for your circuit and I don't know what, he doesn't go and say come on, I mean. It makes the person feel that he has a problem now. Someone who has electricity, a generator that is working, he doesn't feel he has an isolation problem because he expects it to be normal, but for whom? I mean, I wanted to talk to one of the workers, and he said that this is the problem, the splits, the cold air, and the lack of lighting, the lighting that kills germs causes the flu, the flu, but no one thinks about it. This one is also thinking about it. \r\n\r\n00:57:43 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nRight? \r\n\r\n00:57:45 BILAL \r\nAnd only for whom? When you let people know that they are living with a problem. Then you say that I want to help you, solve this problem, and someone says something, I mean, why the wind? Why should I do this? The money for insulation? I don't need it, I am comfortable. I mean, I have enough money to be able to pay for the oil, I can pay what I need to do the air conditioning, and that's enough. But for whom do you start? The general public clarifies that first of all, this price is now reasonable for a year, the price of generators has become weak, what are you eating it for, and making the person feel that you are with him in thinking, not that you are trying to sell him something \r\n\r\n00:58:31 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nIs that true? \r\n\r\n00:58:32 BILAL \r\nThis is one of the frameworks of money, money, training, that we are not giving, but technology, or just information about the ways that one brings green building inside homes, because people \r\n\r\n00:58:44 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nsay yes it is coming from the West \r\n\r\n00:58:46 BILAL \r\nAll the support is coming from major institutions \r\n\r\n00:58:50 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nIs that true? \r\n\r\n00:58:59 BILAL \r\nAn idea was issued in which he can put his pure intentions that this is. This means the environment, meaning God Almighty created this beautiful world for us and we must take care of it. Extravagance is one of the things that came, I mean, it is completely wrong for someone to be extravagant, so this has meanings and lifespan, but what kind of people? \r\n\r\n00:59:19 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. By God, \r\n\r\n00:59:24 BILAL \r\n. I don’t know what? It must be true, in fact \r\n\r\n00:59:29 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nI think that we have principles, I completely understood what you said. What are some of the principles that they must work on? God bless you, I really, really know what you want to get across, I mean, notice, professor, we have what you have an idea about, reverse engineering, \r\n\r\n00:59:51 BILAL \r\nexplain it to me, give it to me in English so I know that I am not listening? \r\n\r\n00:59:55 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nteaming engineering. The idea is that you mean India, reverse engineering, addresses the basic need? The need means the root of the problem, for example, the dining table. We deal with the appearance of the food, whether it's wood, iron, stainless steel, glass, etc., and beautiful, ugly, and lightweight, but in the end, it's reverse engineering. Yes, you come to deal with the dining table as if it were just that. Only, but in the end, it's a need to raise the floor instead of you sitting down. It will raise the floor to a height suitable for you to use it. Okay, this is the simplicity of thinking. We have customs. The lowest customs, yes, at home, daily life, a wrong lifestyle. I mean, part of the culture of the city of Mosul, for example, is that houses must be washed with water daily. Do you have an idea about this? \r\n\r\n01:01:04 BILAL \r\nI know from my father? \r\n\r\n01:01:07 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nYes, good, a nice car. And the car? \r\n\r\n01:01:12 BILAL \r\nRight? \r\n\r\n01:01:13 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. And he sprinkles any idea of bribery, and for this? Which man wants to build his house? Or return the needs? Or for the house, what? He asks her, and she tells him, leave me? Half the wall is ceramic, one and a half meters high, two meters and 80? So that I can wash it every day, and it's comfortable. And for this reason, he must use resistant materials. What kind of tiles are used, which are resistant to washing, and against. For the future, I mean. This process is what is coming to take us back, I mean, currently, lightweight porcelain, for example, is high quality, high quality, you can leave it under the insulation layers at a reasonable cost, but if you're working on a house, for example, two or three floors and it's all tiled, you have to enlarge the foundation and increase the costs. You know what I mean, this live, the style of daily habits, the daily habits, they are coming to cause us problems, meaning, education starts from the simplest. Isolate the place of moisture. Yes \r\n\r\n01:02:31 BILAL \r\n. Architectural engineers. And we will \r\n\r\n01:02:33 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. We will give them \r\n\r\n01:02:35 BILAL \r\ninformation, feelings, or treatment. What will we do in this course? \r\n\r\n01:02:41 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Here? I am a professor, everyone speaks about their art, everyone speaks about their specialty. I told you that this detail definitely has an architectural solution, like isolating my sanitary groups or distributing the ventilation openings. An architect, even if I give you an opinion on this issue, but as a civil structural engineer and as a manager of administrative work, project management, I can give you an idea about the implementation problems, I can give him an idea about the implementation methods, about everything in the implementation. I mean, the architect must play his full role to reach the state we want. Okay, he wants to work on the fact that if I have an area of 100 square meters or 120 square meters, I start distributing it in a way that serves a family of, say, eight people, and maybe one of them will get married in the future because people think this way, okay, so he starts using how many sanitary groups, what type of construction? What is the maintenance method? What are the things they need to work on? These are all things that we do not take into account, yes, the owner of the house, because of his simple science, which is his right, and at the same time, he has no education about it. I mean, yes, previously, ventilation was close to zero, but there were a lot of breathing problems. We saw it in the old city. I mean, there is no ventilation, there is only a commotion. What? And we also noticed that the smell, I mean, the smell of decay, I mean, inside the houses, reaches the far, humid corners. I mean, with the heat, fungi and mold form, and this is the third. Yes. So the idea, if it is a connection, I mean, for example, when someone comes to me, yes, we need social dissemination, we need, let's not forget that not all people \r\n\r\n01:04:52 BILAL \r\n. Hello. Not all people have \r\n\r\n01:05:03 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Not all people have it. Not all people have the same mentality, Mr. Bilal \r\n\r\n01:05:09 BILAL \r\n. Yes, right? \r\n\r\n01:05:10 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nI mean we deal with their homes, listen I'll shock you with this fact, right after the war, about 40 to 50% of people suffer from psychological shock, or rather a large number of them lost their minds, or these, what do you leave them like? \r\n\r\n01:05:30 BILAL \r\nUmm what? \r\n\r\n01:05:43 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nWe'll have it until we reach a state and convince the government agencies, that is, man, this is the real job, right, the numbers that will save you this much megawatt, this much dollar, this much will save you? Damage on the roads? Because you're the one transporting materials, you transport them on roads that get damaged by the weight, so it's a very big story \r\n\r\n01:06:09 BILAL \r\nYeah yeah, listen I mean, is there a possibility, um? I mean, the place we work in, and maybe there will be more interaction if we focus on the new construction that will be like this around all of Mosul \r\n\r\n01:06:32 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes, that's right. Exactly \r\n\r\n01:06:39 BILAL \r\nWe don't work house by house. Sometimes it's towards the street, and the sun, the air, and the wind. Right? So how can we work house by house and we need to work on the street? No, I mean, it's necessary. We have to see if there's a possibility. In this field, yes, it's better. Because we have more control over deeper things and there's a possibility, I mean, I don't know how, I don't know from where, but the building approvals are, I mean, I don't know what they say in Arabic, but I mean \r\n\r\n01:07:13 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nand accompanying him, yes? \r\n\r\n01:07:17 BILAL \r\nI mean, like she wants to fill in that she has to have this insulation. Quantity. I want to see what I expect all the people who live in these houses to look at the window, these will enter them in front of them, but every one when you buy a house has a reading that you see I don't know what, when you buy it, there are numbers, this is not the person who goes to the owner of the store, and if he tells him is this window good or bad? \r\n\r\n01:07:46 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. No, he doesn't go \r\n\r\n01:07:47 BILAL \r\n. He goes and buys a window and on it is a big E. B red. Yes, mom. He doesn't just put this next to him. How much will it consume per year? And how much? It will cost you more if you go to B, F, A? It exists because it is controlled. This is a country of ideas about the market, so I expect it is from two sides, certainly from the people and the people, I mean it is important to them, so the people, the government is the one who makes the laws, and I don’t know what else, certainly not coming from the companies, from the companies who say I want to put a big letter on my window so I can tell them that this hahahahaha there is nothing wrong with it like this is enough \r\n\r\n01:08:28 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. There are laws that govern them. There are laws that force them to have this credibility. \r\n\r\n01:08:34 BILAL \r\nSo I expect that this is not for 3 years, and this goal, if we talk with the young people, is that we are the ones who will train the architects, this is like the one until we come up with a model for this report. If something, I don’t know how, works in Iraq, it is to bring all the architects and engineers to the government. We try to gather the majority of people around this idea, that this is better for us, better for the people, and better for the future of Iraq, and we want the government to do something about this issue. \r\n\r\n01:09:19 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Exactly. \r\n\r\n01:09:20 BILAL \r\nAnd this project, it is not what we are doing, it is not that we will do direct training, it will be construction, right? \r\n\r\n01:09:27 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. The training will be \r\n\r\n01:09:28 BILAL \r\n. We will come up with ideas. And we will form a community of people. People, I mean, architect, architect, engineer, engineer, they will be 100% convincing, from among the ideas that we want to gather together, and it will be a discussion, not an answer. Sometimes I feel that. The way I am very frank and I do not like to do things, I mean, from outside, compliments and nothing more. Sometimes I feel that people say, put solar panels on it, do you want a... something, I mean something simple, and I mean, like you say, we have to think about the mentality and culture of the people that we are living in a disaster of pollution, and the problem is the... the... the... the... in Iraq, the scarcity of water \r\n\r\n01:10:20 WIFAQ AHMED , \r\nright? \r\n\r\n01:10:21 BILAL \r\n. In English, like the lyre coming \r\n\r\n01:10:30 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. So let me \r\n\r\n01:10:31 BILAL \r\n. We move \r\n\r\n01:10:33 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Hahaha. So. Mr. bilan. I think it's better to make it a general plan in stages. We start with the simple logical beginnings. And we work on the. Let's call it that. We promised at the same time to work on a line. Yes, we are the owners of the problem, meaning we are not the owners of the solution. I think with the mentality that I am the owner of the problem \r\n\r\n01:11:07 BILAL \r\nWhat? \r\n\r\n01:11:09 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes, I am the owner of the problem. How do I solve it? Knowing that I have economic limitations, what? How will I welcome the support? How? I don't doubt the support, and at the same time, what do we have? It's very important, if. If we can. Yes, we help some of the people who are trying to cancel the electricity generators, the oh the temporary ones in the streets. This is frankly, this is a deeply rooted issue, but it cannot be eliminated in this way. There are details at the appropriate time. I will give it to you. Record it with you as points and I will give it to you at the appropriate time, because there are sustainable, easy, applicable solutions led by some honorable engineers in Mosul until the idea of external generators is eliminated, provided that there is... Let's call it... A fixed quantity or number of amperes. This is basic so that whenever the electricity is cut off, I mean by using some modern technologies, which are special types of ammeters or something like that, I mean some details. Okay, Professor Bilal \r\n\r\n01:12:23 BILAL \r\n. On this project, they remove the generators from the streets, no. Not everything is used, I mean this is the first time I've heard of this \r\n\r\n01:12:30 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Oh, good, this. I will give you the main points of some engineers from within government departments, especially the Electricity Distribution Sector Department. And some heroic engineers within the governorate are trying to build their city in the right way. But the generators know, it's a big file in the corps, meaning the goal is for the crisis to continue so that the benefit continues. And yes, and this has become very clear, I mean, from. From the coordination of many years, I mean many years, this file could have been closed, but no one wants to close it. So the thing is. Some of the engineers who are currently in their last days in the job are old, yes, they are. What is this? He is trying his best to change before he leaves, because whoever leaves expects that there is no one who can carry the banner of, I mean, eliminating this corruption. So I know some people who I told you at the appropriate time to give you the complete plan, so that we have some - let's call it evidence that we want to work in this correct way, right? Yes \r\n\r\n01:13:58 BILAL \r\n. Yes. Be happy, be happy, the goal. Through this project, one day there will be dealings, with the government. New things need to happen. But what? What do you encourage that day? Because all the stories that I'm hearing now, you all these, this story, this opens up for me, I mean, a new vision that it's true, I mean, no person, no person, we take each person \r\n\r\n01:14:29 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you information that. I worked for about two and a half years or a little more, in the cabinet of the advisor to the Minister of Electricity. The one who was later promoted, became the Minister of Electricity for a short period. So I know the details of the Ministry of Electricity from the inside. I know the way decisions are made, the way decisions are canceled, the way plans are made, the way things are carried out, and Iraq is a country that is coming to grow in population significantly, and its needs are going to increase and its resources are going to decrease, the resources of the rapid, I mean, currently in Mosul. The problem is, in general, the idea of the collection of taxes is also part of it. The more you reduce collection and increase services to homes and shops, of course, of course, this will encourage society to do this. And don't forget, we can reach all segments of society, because the community activists in Mosul are very strong, very strong, they can change a political decision. Yes, they are the heroes who depend on them. \r\n\r\n01:16:19 BILAL \r\n. I mean, \r\n\r\n01:16:21 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. The activists in Mosul are many, Professor, many, many, Professor Bilal. I mean, who are they, young people? Some of them are engineers, yes, most of them are engineers or professors or, yes, young people trying to change their society for the better. They have had several successes, they have in changing political decisions. And with all calm. Without clashes. \r\n\r\n01:16:49 BILAL \r\n. Nice. Good, our best \r\n\r\n01:16:51 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. The topic means approximately \r\n\r\n01:16:54 BILAL \r\n. We are trying to analyze the problems that may sustain Iraq in general, so everything is Tunisy, yes, with this entrance, which is one honesty, if he does not do this idea of reverse engineering and sees the problem, where does honesty come from? It is possible that he will solve the problem, and I mean, no, no, no, changing the post, because it did not come in the right place. This talk was very nice, and I mean, what is called the result for me is that it encouraged even more that this study be like you say, we are people who ask questions, not people who answer, so we will do this training as people who ask questions and research, and I mean, a connection with the market, and I like that it raised the same questions that are currently being asked by the community, from them, these people who put in, spend, work, why do they not put in an insulator? How do we accept? Let them feel the same way? Yes? An insulator. I don't know, \r\n\r\n01:18:15 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Professor. Professor Bilal, what do you mean? There's a lot to say, but let me give you some information. What is my general company? I think it's the General Trading Company, and that company's name is affiliated with the Ministry of Trade. It provides raw construction materials for new homes, okay? For example, doors and windows with modern cement reinforcement. So, among them, the state can support with cork boards, for example, or polyester boards, or moisture insulators. I mean, it's possible that we can support initiatives adopted by the state, so that in the end it goes back to the state, with the intention of reducing the pressure on the energy sector. \r\n\r\n01:19:03 BILAL \r\n. Okay, wait a minute. Not at all, I get it. \r\n\r\n01:19:10 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. What does it mean that I am a citizen and I have, what kind of a license, a construction license, so instead of buying reinforcing steel from the local market? I go to my building permit, I get B from B, I mean B from my building permit, I receive from the state, for example, 10 tons or 6 tons of reinforcing steel, and I receive, for example, according to the map, because I have a building permit, so I receive doors at a subsidized price, and I also receive, for example, any other wood materials, for example, at a subsidized price, or I receive sanitary materials, I receive them at a subsidized price from the public company. Ok, so what do we want? Excuse me, what if we add? Cork boards and basic insulation? What will happen? The state subsidizes a little and loses a little in terms of subsidizing these materials according to the building permits. I mean, it encourages the citizen to get a building permit so that he can receive good materials, and in return, what will happen to the state? Then the pressure will decrease because of the good insulation, then the pressure on the energy sector will decrease. \r\n\r\n01:20:23 BILAL \r\n. One has to do it B. B in a clear and profound manner. Yes. About this, before this, if someone goes and gets a map and goes and does documentation with the government, yes \r\n\r\n01:20:43 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes, yes, yes it exists, because my brother used to work at the Ministry of Commerce, so he knows these details. Also, in every governorate, there are outlets for citizens to receive these subsidized construction materials, and these initiatives are what encouraged construction at a time, especially during the days of the economic blockade, they existed, and now they exist \r\n\r\n01:21:07 BILAL \r\n. Very important. I don't know how I didn't hear it. This is a great idea. Nice \r\n\r\n01:21:14 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Of course \r\n\r\n01:21:16 BILAL. \r\nI mean, the only thing that needs to change is what is added to the wood? \r\n\r\n01:21:21 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. It should be added, yes it should be added, but how do you get the decision that we must submit our files to the exact people whose details I mentioned to you, for example, that he is a prime minister, for example, M and One, and we make him the diagram, and we make him the plans and charts that prove our words, yes, and also prove that there are academics and ministers, we tell them, \"Yes.\" This. This is the detail that we have, so the detail should be logical, and this is frankly. Let's say that the political game requires the support of such laws because this ultimately has a political, social, and economic return. \r\n\r\n01:22:00 BILAL \r\n. In English, they call it win, win, win. \r\n\r\n01:22:04 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Exactly, no one loses \r\n\r\n01:22:07 BILAL \r\nWhat I liked about it is that the idea that I had was that it didn't have a method, and it didn't have a goal, it was very clear, it was that we go and do these researches, and try to determine the past, I don't know what, and then we say building the green area, if the building benefits Iraq and Mosul, then these \r\n\r\n01:22:27 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Crete \r\n\r\n01:22:29 BILAL \r\n. For the government to document the map, but I mean, until it happens. This is difficult, because someone might not come and build, the government might come and say no, it has to be news, there is a possibility that they will decide one day and that's how it happens, but this is even better, because it's not that you don't let people build other things, but you financially encourage them to build in this way. M. F \r\n\r\n01:22:53 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. And sir, you are asking for disguised unemployment. I mean, the employees are there. The employee, when you tell him that you have the such-and-such sector. The building permits that were delivered, these materials, you must not allocate them all at once, meaning he does not take them from the company’s warehouses, but rather after the completion, for example, if he completes the foundations, we will allocate him a house for two days, for example, the foundations, finish burying between the walls, we insulate it, for example, the soft ones, build the roof, we insulate it with iron and cork, and so on, it will be an economic cycle. Yes, because some people started strongly in construction. But because of an economic problem when they faced a lack of funding, what would he do, sell the raw materials that he received from the state? We must ensure that he used them in the appropriate location and with documentation. I mean, I have. I have the ability, you know what, sir, I have the ability to have the employee or engineer who goes to inspect under oath, I have him go under oath. I mean. I mean, even. To ensure that the security of the mission is completed, I mean, in any case, there are many ideas, Mr. Bilal. I mean, I think that we are now in this meeting. We came up with 67 main topics. Honestly, by God, each one of them has a four-year income \r\n\r\n01:24:26 BILAL, \r\nbut I mean, I mean, even you know, I don’t work in general on a house project. I’m a consultant. This is routine. This is the training, thank God \r\n\r\n01:24:36 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nGod, yes, these are sometimes \r\n\r\n01:24:39 BILAL \r\n. The problem is because there are people who work as a hospital, meaning one is a consultant or works. A year if he leaves, if it’s a project, will the house project be finished or three years? So, she means, sometimes she has to come, I mean, from. From people like you who live in the country and know it, and who take responsibility, and build this society, and for the next few years, they will continue with it. \r\n\r\n01:25:07 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes. \r\n\r\n01:25:08 BILAL \r\n. So, I just try to make my work good. Hahaha, my work. It benefits people who think and is radical, not \r\n\r\n01:25:16 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. It is. God bless you. Therefore, I personally prefer that you work on the low-hanging fruit, which are the closest ideas that can be implemented, and keep the rest in a file at hand. It is withdrawn from him as needed, yes, if the project develops, develops, stops the project at the right moment, yes, we might find a sponsor, we might find a loophole, we might find something, we trust in God for the other stages \r\n\r\n01:25:46 BILAL \r\nIf no, no, yes, the goal of our training is this, yes, the search for the yes? The ecufloncy rate of money, I mean, when will the government return its money, if it supports the materials of the scourge, I mean, will it put it on the list of things that they claim, and what is the price? \r\n\r\n01:26:11 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nYes? \r\n\r\n01:26:13 BILAL \r\nI mean, the money must be reduced, even the return from homes will be more, I mean, it is possible, not only for the scourge, it is possible that we go and make the search a little broader, and then? \r\n\r\n01:26:25 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes, this \r\n\r\n01:26:26 BILAL \r\nfor six people to renew. Money, I don't know what to call it for six people, which the government will accept on the initiative that we will give you a discount, oh, I mean, half the price, money money failure? \r\n\r\n01:26:41 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nYes, support, support means yes \r\n\r\n01:26:43 BILAL \r\n. So \r\n\r\n01:26:44 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. By God, this project, this is very nice, and I have it, I mean, I expect that it \r\n\r\n01:27:04 BILAL \r\n. Hello. Hello, oh, wow, okay. Great, I thought the line was gone, sorry, the phone ran out of battery \r\n\r\n01:29:39 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Now, yeah. Hahaha \r\n\r\n01:29:41 BILAL \r\nSorry, sorry, yes, I'm waiting for you about the last idea, that if I try to do the research, for this training, we focus on the subject. I don't know, he should give it a nice name. But the research is something that indicates that he truly supports the construction of Mosul, I mean this is the basis of it, the ah, between the ah, the cost of the ah, the electricity, the cost of the ah, the materials, the cost of the ah, the shortage of the ah, the beginning of this simple equation? \r\n\r\n01:30:32 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nOr even a residential or even an investor in the complex, you have no problem, he still has a license, yes, he activates the municipal laws that are inactive regarding issuing building permits and random construction, yes, he establishes control and provides real support to the needy segments, I mean, there are people who do not need this process, he is financially capable, so he does not need to be strict on the materials, he solves it, he helps support the, I mean, indirectly, the private sector, the transportation sector, the shipping sector, the workers provide job opportunities, because these are the operations of downloading, escalation, transportation, and heavy transportation, these are all things. It will also help in something important, which is, ah, the governorate’s ranking will increase, I mean, the work or the governorate’s achievements as a cabin and as a governor will increase? \r\n\r\n01:31:43 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes, that’s right. \r\n\r\n01:31:46 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nAnd ten amps can operate a house, while you are with t, ah, the split unit case, and modern air conditioning units only need 30 amps, okay? \r\n\r\n01:31:57 BILAL \r\n. The 30, Amberd Beit is comfortable with it. And we escaped. This one, no. No, and Fron is comfortable \r\n\r\n01:32:08 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. That I provided you with materials? Then? Yes, that's important. Okay \r\n\r\n01:32:17 BILAL \r\nLike he told me, it's. Money doesn't matter. They don't need this insulator and I don't know what else, but when you arrange it, you see that the problem is not just the idea of money, the problem is that you exercise in the winter, in the summer? Where is the sun coming from? Where is the air, the air movement in the house, if it's right, it means at least you can open a window like this, guys, and you have a sufficient percentage of insulation so that you have the lighting, and it helps the minority who surrender it in English, in English, meaning the number of the virus in the air \r\n\r\n01:32:54 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nRight? \r\n\r\n01:32:55 BILAL \r\n. I mean, there is a possibility that you pay 100 dollars and you don't know that you will get sick and be affected, you pay, I mean, machines, right, no, I mean, after that, we are different \r\n\r\n01:33:04 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. We have, we also have a situation, a situation that we expect, Professor, do you have the Ministry of Industry currently? It is possible that you can support the production of these materials that are sold to citizens, I mean. I mean, it produces wood, for example, or it produces cork, or it produces dyes in its factories. I mean, it will work. We have a private sector, a public sector, a government sector, and a joint sector. Frankly speaking, \r\n\r\n01:33:36 BILAL \r\nThe private sector has been making insulation for a long time. I don't know if I heard you correctly? \r\n\r\n01:33:42 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nEvery governorate has it, but for example. What kind of insulators do you mean exactly? Excuse me? \r\n\r\n01:33:54 BILAL \r\n. In the past, we didn't reach these materials. And then it stopped. But this might be my imagination. \r\n\r\n01:34:03 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Maybe, Professor, I didn't say it in this way? But the important thing that I want to focus on for you is that it is possible to create new industries. For example, a factory owner who produces gypsum board, we don't have it. This is our production. We still get it from Turkey. So if there is a strong pull on it. Like what happened, for example, on water bottle ampoules, they used to come from Iran and Turkey, then when it happened on healthy water bottles that are distributed daily, yes, there are FD A, meaning granules that come from abroad, and then KBR and they turn them into ampoules, and the ampoules, you as a user of your lab, can inflate them, turn them into whatever you want, a water bottle you want to turn, a bottle, a small glass, a mug, you want to turn it into any, any shape, so that, the same idea, you have \r\n\r\n01:35:07 BILAL \r\n. Which is similar to the need that we want to talk about with the insulator ratio, meaning the percentage of reflected nitrogen, and \r\n\r\n01:35:15 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. The process \r\n\r\n01:35:16 BILAL \r\nof the industry B. B inside and around Mosul. Our ignition? \r\n\r\n01:35:20 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. This. Here it exists, I mean I will give you some information, for example, Mosul had factories for the car liter factory, which I think was authorized by Volvo, I expect something like that? Okay, and this. This was in the sixties, seventies, fives, and their grandchildren are currently working in this sector, which is the justification of cars, so, and also capital, professor, capital is what builds the city, I mean, you have why capital is fleeing abroad, whether it is building in Baghdad or building in Amman, for example, or building in Turkey, in that it is possible to build within a city, meaning importing factories 21 to draw iron, for example, and reinforcing iron or mixing paints or even producing paints, and for example gypsum board, and cuttings in 60 and its beams, work to generate work, I mean, do not forget that, according to what I understood from the municipality director a while ago, he was talking about whether it would become an industrial zone. I mean, an industrial city thanks to the expansion, and so on. Yes, if you search for industrial cities in Iraq, you will find that three or four industrial cities have been opened, with one industrial city in each governorate. These are facilities, I mean Jordan. Anbar, Samawah, Basra, yes, Baghdad, industrial cities have been opened, if I remember correctly . \r\n\r\n01:36:52 BILAL \r\n. I will go have lunch, God willing. If I have it. I did not extend the call. First, thank you, Tunis \r\n\r\n, 01:36:59 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I swear , \r\n\r\n01:37:02 BILAL \r\n. It has expanded. Yes, thank you for the sweet \r\n\r\n01:37:07 WIFAQ AHMED call \r\n. Yes. And God bless you. Yes, \r\n\r\n01:37:09 BILAL \r\n. I wish you the best, and for this work, I will see \r\n\r\n01:37:13 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I mean, all of us \r\n\r\n01:37:14 BILAL \r\ncan, I mean, benefit from you, whatever suits them and you suit them, the best thing, I mean, there is something preferable, and if I can do it, something, hahaha, with this person, he told me they have a proposal and I liked it a lot hahaha \r\n\r\n01:37:31 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. God bless you. Ah \r\n\r\n01:37:39 BILAL I mean, \r\nnot. Not. We won't be confused with 1,000,000 ideas. I want to see, I mean, the suggestion from you, we will give you the Italian framework, my question is, see how you answer this framework well? \r\n\r\n01:37:50 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nWe want? \r\n\r\n01:37:51 BILAL \r\nWe will be, I mean, ah. Sustainable homes, right? And we help people find job opportunities. These people are the majority of the pictures. They will be, I mean, on the mind. Oh, what we want to focus on now, yeah, architects. We have a part \r\n\r\n01:38:11 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nOkay? \r\n\r\n01:38:12 BILAL . \r\nAnd we have six days with them, or seven, ten, or less. I mean, we don't have a hobby. What time? \r\n\r\n01:38:18 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. You do it okay until \r\n\r\n01:38:20 BILAL \r\nthey can come and benefit, learn something, do something, until we get these two things, that is, sustainable homes. Most of all, they wanted to focus on the possibility, not everything, I mean \r\n\r\n01:38:41 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nOkay? \r\n\r\n01:38:43 BILAL \r\nand business. Ah, we have six days and the Resona means a person who is a student, yes he has knowledge and experience, but he doesn't drink and we want to make this TV, when? What do you do? This question? \r\n\r\n01:38:59 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. By God, professor, it depends on the method or the curriculum, the talk that you depend on, so yes I think that yes, I mean you push them to educate them about the current problems that exist. After I return, I mean, from the source that you have, whether academics or numbers or ah, news or whatever, you know how to analyze the problem, give it to them ready-made without putting pressure on their brains, we have a, the environmental problem is not pressured by an economic, social, political situation, for example, we have increased divorce rates, now you tell me that the divorce rates are due to the temperature. I tell you that the divorce and crime rates are related to the temperature. I mean, this is what I have, yes, my sister, yes, the investigations specialty, yes, and these things, because of his specialty, the temperature, if it increases above a certain degree, a person goes beyond his natural plane and has a higher reaction, so it increases in him. Other problems, I summarize for him, I summarize for him, I give him a summary as soon as I start with him, we have this many problems, the second stage, I tell him to think outside the box. But rely on something, yes, an implementation, I mean, how, for example, the Taiwanese experience, I receive it, if it matches this, it solves the problem, then in the third stage, I mix between all the ideas, and I come up with one result, yes, from it, the board that we talked about, I mean, I collect the sea parts and issue it, the fourth stage in a way that the citizen, the government, the experts and the specialists understand. I mean, only four stages \r\n\r\n01:40:47 BILAL \r\nHow will it help them to have job opportunities? After the question? \r\n\r\n01:40:53 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. No, sir, we will return to the need for her to address the government agencies with it, for example, hold a lecture or two, yes, in the Engineers Syndicate for example? And invite all investors under the supervision of yes, the Investment Department in the governorate. The investors will understand that these are opportunities. And you will find opportunities for engineers who are interested in this field. The presence of representatives from the local government might issue a decision on it. I think there will be a kind of interlocking, meaning the partnership and interlocking, yes. Of course, this \r\n\r\n01:41:42 BILAL \r\n. It is possible. I mean, isn't your father Halima with it? If you know the translation for me in English, but in English does it affect the government? we. I mean, he suggests. They call it \r\n\r\n01:41:59 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Correct, a policy paper. A policy paper. Yes \r\n\r\n, \r\npolice policies \r\n\r\n, \r\n\r\nI \r\nmean \r\n, yes ... Not me, nor the trainers, but the young people explain it and then break their fast around them. The police paper is the best thing \r\n\r\n01:43:11 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nBy God, your idea is creative. And I tell you it is applicable. In fact, it was a really great idea. But, sir, approximately how many trainees do you have? \r\n\r\n01:43:23 BILAL \r\n.75? And every time the meal is 15/20 something \r\n\r\n01:43:31 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Very excellent, the idea is successful, and I mean, I think, God willing, it has good signs. The idea of competition is very nice and nice \r\n\r\n01:43:42 BILAL \r\nThe competition, I mean, in my opinion, the first opinion was the idea that he focused on taking the details, the construction that they needed to do, yeah, I mean, what were the early gains? And we bring them so that there is a relationship between a person, meaning a valve and a draftsman, and a person, meaning a wealthy person, and I have an experience with them, and they have a relationship, one of them liked the idea, the proposal, and the method of approach, and his eloquence, I try to connect it within the project, the idea of working in form a little more, meaning they are sitting in the room, the owner of the work opportunities and the owner of the person who needs the work opportunities, and he makes it, meaning he shares the capabilities, meaning he says there is nothing better than this, but with regard to the basic and radical change that we are talking about, yes, this is the idea of the policy paper in what \r\n\r\n01:44:43 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I know, yes \r\n\r\n01:44:46 BILAL \r\nI'm not sure it's possible. It's possible. Do you know who the people will be? \r\n\r\n01:44:53 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Decisive? I mean, arbitrators, I mean the ones who issue the decision \r\n\r\n01:45:02 BILAL \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n01:45:02 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Yes, yes, the arbitration committee, I mean \r\n\r\n01:45:05 BILAL, \r\nthe arbitrators in the room, let them be okay from the government and the market, I mean the public sector, the private sector, I mean the office people, so they say in English, a bird for a bird, two birds for one stone, we let it be like this, we merge them, yes, I mean, there are a lot of ideas between the Al and the Al, the two of them can be similar, yes, it's known \r\n\r\n01:45:39 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. So, do you have raw data, Mr. Bilal? So, is her deterrent now in your hands? Shall I order you around? Analyze it as you please. Absolutely. Absolutely. Analyze it as you please and adjust it. Later, you will find that you have several options. Maybe a creative idea will come at the right time. As for me, I am available, God willing. I mean, whenever you need me, God willing. But you have to communicate. And with me. Yes, I will write you a number. My mobile. I don't have a number. My mobile. Maybe, Professor, if I had \r\n\r\n01:46:10 BILAL \r\n. Is there a possibility? No, \r\n\r\n01:46:13 WIFAQ AHMED, \r\ncan you help me? Yes? \r\n\r\n01:46:16 BILAL \r\n. She is just a coordinator we are, so she can arrange the calls. And not always \r\n\r\n01:46:24 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I sent you my number. And the international line. Let me. 01:46:31 BILAL And the last thing is that we must make sure of it. Let's say that we have arranged our training schedule. I will come in the middle of the month, seven, and I will appoint the people who will \r\n\r\nimplement \r\nit. I am the one who will do the design. There is a possibility that it will change a little when we share it. And the trainers can do it their own way, I mean the methods of rhetoric, they can change it, but the model, and the idea is that we will bring the I mean with the wise men and the competition, the political dilemma, I mean you have one of the trainers, this is it, and \r\n\r\n01:47:22 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nYes? \r\n\r\n01:47:23 BILAL \r\n. For each side, the training sides, from the insulator and the solar, and this is the architecture. \r\n\r\n01:47:31 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Me. I am present, professor, I mean the opposite. Of course. Of course, of course, I mean, yes, I am very grateful that he nominated you in detail and ready, and even with the curriculum, if you would like us to help you with it, God willing, we are ready . \r\n\r\n01:47:48 BILAL \r\nThank you, this is my job. But my job is to learn from people who know and just collect information and organize it in a certain way, I mean. Yes, it is very important, and you benefited a lot. Yes, I was happy. Yes, with the call more, yes, a clearer picture, yes? \r\n\r\n01:48:07 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nDid we arrange it? \r\n\r\n01:48:08 BILAL \r\n. A model. And I will send it to you, and you can, God willing, help me with it. \r\n\r\n01:48:12 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I am present, present and available, God willing, my dear Professor Bilal. \r\n\r\n01:48:17 BILAL \r\n. Correctly before the exercises, I mean, if yes \r\n\r\n01:48:22 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nOf course, of course. I am a training provider and a training project manager with UNICEF. One of our training projects was successful in Iraq and I met with the Dutch ambassador twice as a donor. What is that? \r\n\r\n01:48:40 BILAL \r\n. Topics \r\n\r\n01:48:42 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nTopics. For the youth, we have done matchmaking between the private and public sectors. And, as innovators, we have given them training so they can become entrepreneurs. Supervisor Firas, meaning investors? \r\n\r\n01:49:04 BILAL \r\nis doing social media training. Oh, great. \r\n\r\n01:49:05 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. God, I have a trip to Lebanon, I think before the end of the year, meaning in October, I have a trip to Holland, where I have a forum seminar, and I think at the beginning of November, if things are good, I have a trip, God willing, to Lebanon to the Engineers Syndicate, they are a possibility for me to open a job there with the most important training related to the heritage heritage, the heritage and the heritage buildings in Beirut \r\n\r\n01:49:38 BILAL \r\n. Very chic, Lebanon is beautiful, I mean, I lived there for years and I liked the hobby of Lebanon, and I want a trip to return to it, God willing \r\n\r\n01:49:48 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. God willing, God willing, if things are good and our time allows, we will even meet there, God willing, in addition to Qana in Iraq, definitely God willing \r\n\r\n01:49:58 BILAL \r\n1920 something, something. And God willing \r\n\r\n01:50:01 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n700 who? \r\n\r\n01:50:03 BILAL \r\nThe result of all the research, and of course, I will pay for it from her side, yes, and then the idea that we do, I mean, I don't want to call it that because I feel that it means that I have something that I must give you, and you take it from other people, \r\n\r\n01:50:19 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n, but I always, yes, \r\n\r\n01:50:21 BILAL \r\n. The smartest person in the room is the room, and this thinking, thinking in English, they call it. In Arabic, \r\n\r\n01:50:32 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I mean, you can almost say this form \r\n\r\n01:50:36 BILAL \r\n, but to understand, I mean, the idea of physiotherapy is that you create an environment from which people learn, not you, the facilitator? \r\n\r\n01:50:46 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. I mean, you can say facilitating or simplifying things, right? Yes \r\n\r\n01:50:59 BILAL \r\nIt is really understood that the training that we will do from here there, is it not that I am Bilal, a graduate, I don’t know what he did with this design? Hahaha, it is for training and I will teach you how, you teach people, no, on the contrary, hahaha, I will say that this idea that we took from you from all our ideas together, I collected as much as he could even say something nice, and let’s work together to think about it. Analyze it more, and adjust it together. And then you and change it to. To your taste. In the end, you must present it, you must feel that it is yours, not that one of the French committees gave it to me, no, no, it is your place, so let’s go to the root, we will go to the repair, the engineer we made it, I will present it to you, and then from there the the the. You will choose from the people who made this, I will name it. This FOF, they will choose from among themselves the people who will present the project, but for someone who knows people, it is clear that you know people in the private sector, and people in the government, and if we wanted to do this session between them, between the engineers and the students in the class, and the owners of companies and offices, and they suggest a project, if it was the idea of building, you would be one of them, you know how to do it, I mean? If you have time and leisure and are convinced of the idea and money, hahaha, you open the place, right? You have all the information, and you have all the goals and desire, I mean if I see that this is your project, it is almost perfect, so let's see, God willing, we will see you in July and we will see where we get to. As for the design, I might analyze this problem between the model of the house, and I don't know what, yeah and yeah, you notice a lot in the calls \r\n\r\n01:53:05 WIFAQ AHMED \r\nMay God keep you safe \r\n\r\n01:53:08 BILAL \r\n. Hahaha \r\n\r\n01:53:11 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Thank God. First of all, I am happy, of course, Professor Bilal and. I am available at any time for any detail, for any case, that I am available, God willing, and of course, God willing, we will meet and be honored, and I am very grateful to leave a mark with you with this detail, God willing \r\n\r\n01:53:27 BILAL \r\n. You do not find work with them? The afterlife. Of course, God willing \r\n\r\n01:53:41 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Of course, of course. You are welcome. I am waiting for you \r\n\r\n01:53:44 BILAL \r\n. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you \r\n\r\n01:53:47 WIFAQ AHMED \r\n. Peace be upon you, Sheikh Bilal, on my head"
