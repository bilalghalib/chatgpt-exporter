Consider if any sections are missing, and then detail each part of the prompt to address the suggested improvements. Additionally, formulate three questions for each section to enhance it. \n\nNote: I believe we do not need both supports and assumed supports as distinct constructs. Furthermore, the process of identifying constitutive attentional policies in stories about role models and our own past experiences can offer valuable insights for understanding supports and elements that may aid in creatively navigating the tension necessary to identify a higher-order CAP. \n\nI will provide the prompt conversation in three brackets. Take your time to contemplate the meaning of each part, envisioning a real-life use case to help pinpoint its positive aspects and any gaps. This prompt illustrates how the attentional policies (APs) should be derived, which should be incorporated. It also highlights effective prompting techniques from which we can learn to establish principles and the prompt design attentional policies (PDAPs) to apply throughout this process. As you utilize these PDAPs to derive the prompt, please demonstrate the attentional policies you are employing during the rewrite. I'll share the inspirational prompt in three quotes: \n\n\"\"\"You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\n\nYour dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\n\nStart with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\nZoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\nAsk questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\nWhen you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\nCall submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:\n\nDO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\nDON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\nDON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\nDO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\nDON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\nNEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policies\n\nA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\n\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\n\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\n\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\n\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\n\nZooming from goals\n\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\n\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\n\nZooming from feelings\n\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n\nWhen the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\nSince negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\n\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\n\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\n\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\n\nAsk about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\nAsk about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\nGather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\nEnsure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\nMake sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\nStart with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\nWrite from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\nUse general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\nBe precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.\"\"\"\nThe prompt conversation in 3 brackets: [[[ MEANING ALIGNMENT ASSISTANT: SYSTEM PROMPT (PART 1)\nCore Purpose & Foundation\nYou serve as a Meaning Alignment Assistant, helping users discover and live by their authentic sources of meaning while navigating daily pressures.

I have worked to support establishing four community spaces around the world: Lamba Labs in Beirut, Fikra Space in Baghdad, and the Alibi and All Hands Active in Ann Arbor, Michigan.Working with communities to identify motivation, resources, funding, resolve conflicts, and organize democratically. \nPERSONAL STATEMENT\nFor the CMC Diploma in Islamic Psychology Fall 2022\nGrowing up in America, my father would tell me that we don't need therapy; we have prayer. He would also put his wallet on the counter and say: \"We're not like Americans; you won't be kicked out when you're 18. We share what we have.\" In 1991, I remember going to Iraq to visit my family there. The aliveness of my Iraqi family’s culture contrasted greatly with my experience in the States. There I was learning a new way to live, focused on being rather than doing.In Michigan, I spent my youth reading encyclopedias and programming computers while I also loved being alone in nature. Writing songs and poetry drew me, and as the son of immigrants, I pushed to excel in school, where I tied my self-worth to my grades.  It took me many years to understand the confusion of these conflicting narratives of what a good life is. To begin to understand the history of industrialization, capitalism, colonialism, rationalism and reductionism and how they manifested in my life. Furthermore, I believe there is a significant opportunity to unite what is seemingly at complete odds with each other. Initially, just out of college, I worked to promote alternative hands-on educational spaces in response to industrial schooling. I then moved to alternative ways of production and business, focusing on business for good. Community building and human empowerment through education were the core of my work throughout all of this. I was sharing the radical idea that we humans have created the world around us and that we can change it. For the last 11 years, since the Arab Spring, I have been doing this work in Western Asia and North Africa, working to build bridges between the best of what I've learned in the West with the places my family originated. The organization we created to do this work in the last year, Bloom, has supported over 150 entrepreneurs and their businesses and created 147 jobs in socially responsible companies. Since my last application, I've deepened my understanding of Islamic Economics and the purpose of work by taking Dr. Adi Setia and Rhamis Kent's course on the Islamic Gift Economy. One critical reframing I learned was to shift the concept of economics away from its means, or how to allocate resources toward the ends, to provide livelihoods. However, while the reframing brings about an ethical transformation in economic activity (less waste, more equality in pay, better ecological outcomes), it does not address the personal transformations required to create the conditions within people to bring about this new economic reality. What I'd like to continue exploring at CMC is around understanding the self and the personal transformations needed for moral business development. To do this, I'd like to learn what the self is and how an Islamic-oriented method of healing and growth can support unlocking human potential towards a more sustainable economy and future? How can we move from \"hurt people hurt people\" to \"whole people help people.\" How do we make this shift in a way that is not oriented towards greed or ambition for \"doing good\"? How is it related to wellbeing at work? I'd like first to work to develop this within myself and build it into the pedagogy I'm responsible for developing and implementing with social entrepreneurs in my organization and the other educational organizations we support.In this short life of mine, I hope to answer the questions of being and doing, and I’m beginning to see an answer may be in serving. I hope what I learn at CMC can help me develop a deeper understanding and frameworks to support other people in discovering this truth for themselves - for itself. \n​​2021:\nIn 2009 I graduated undergraduate studies in the middle of an economic downturn. The systems that were expected to pay off my student loans and support an isolated family life in the suburbs of Michigan were no longer relevant. In that time I got connected to hacker and open source communities which were sharing resources and I became an evangelist for collectives for direct action. Initially, in my youth, I thought we would transform the world for the better using technology built openly. and with community. So I started traveling the world to preach. I was able to help the foundation of nerd communities around the world and especially the Middle East, except the positive transformation was missing and technology started seeming more like the problem than the solution.\nAfter experiencing violence and a deep loss of faith in my work, starting in 2013 I had a deep personal and spiritual crisis. I realized that I didn’t know what my intentions were and that “Good Is Hard”. Which, not coincidentally, was the last time anyone paid me to give a public talk about “changing the world”. It was good money though!\nThis quote by Rumi summarizes my transforming philosophy well:\n\"Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.\" - Rumi\nI realized that in order for beauty to emerge into the world through our creativity, we must beautify ourselves within. And since then I’ve been studying philosophy, psychology, and personal transformation. In my research, I’ve come across positive psychology, which attempts to understand human flourishing and provides psychometrically validated measuring sticks to measure and guide people and coaches on the path to more fulfilling lives. \nAt CMC I’d love to connect the dots between the model of Islamic Psychology with the model of Positive Psychology. In last year’s Ramadan videos Dr. Rothman brought to my attention the idea of heartfulness and that the Islamic Tradition has a lot to offer all people, Muslims and our neighbors. I believe creating a dictionary of synonyms between Islamic Psychology and Positive Psychology while also evaluating interventions can be a beautiful way to take steps towards making Islamic Psychology useful for all people. \nIn my effort to unleash beautiful human potential my work currently uses the Values in Action Character profile, to help guide a values based exploration of growth through the entrepreneurial journey for social entrepreneurs in the Middle East. I would like to supplement this assessment and intervention framework with my deeper learning of the principles and practices of Islamic Psychology. \nPersonally, my deepest hope is that by understanding the model and practices for polishing the self, we will see more people finding their agency in bringing forth the beauty they contain withinEditLet me analyze these texts for elements that could enrich our framework.\nKey Patterns and Insights:\n\nDevelopment Arc Model\n\nyamlCopytransformation_path:\n  stages:\n    doing_phase:\n      caps: \"MOMENTS focused on external change\"\n      tension: \"Action without inner alignment\"\n    \n    being_phase:\n      caps: \"SPACES where presence deepens\"\n      tension: \"Being without service\"\n    \n    serving_phase:\n      caps: \"CHOICES that unite being and doing\"\n      integration: \"Service as natural expression\"\n\nCultural Integration Pattern\n\nyamlCopyintegration_framework:\n  tensions:\n    - American vs. Traditional values\n    - Technology vs. Human connection\n    - Individual vs. Collective wellbeing\n  \n  resolution_paths:\n    caps:\n      - \"MOMENTS where traditions offer wisdom\"\n      - \"SPACES where cultures harmonize\"\n      - \"WAYS different values complement\"\nLet me create a new diagram type to show these developmental patterns:UntitledClick to open diagramAdditional Framework Enrichments:\n\nSupport Types Enhancement:\n\nyamlCopysupport_framework:\n  community_container:\n    caps:\n      - \"SPACES where resources naturally flow\"\n      - \"MOMENTS where wisdom emerges collectively\"\n    \n  cultural_bridge:\n    caps:\n      - \"WAYS traditions offer guidance\"\n      - \"PRACTICES that unite wisdom sources\"\n\n  transformation_container:\n    caps:\n      - \"MOVEMENTS from doing to being\"\n      - \"SHIFTS from isolation to service\"\n\nPattern Recognition Enhancement:\n\nyamlCopypattern_types:\n  development_patterns:\n    - Doing without being\n    - Being without serving\n    - Service emerging naturally\n  \n  integration_patterns:\n    - Cultural wisdom bridging\n    - Traditional-modern harmony\n    - Individual-collective balance\nWould you like me to:\n\nCreate additional diagrams showing these new patterns?\nDevelop specific aspects of the framework enrichments?\nExplore how these insights modify our core model?]]]"

I like the daily check-in process to be a little simpler somehow where we can where we can assess how they're feeling you know the energy level what their main focus is today or what would make Taddei feel complete and potential challenges. Yeah, and then in the evening, it could be as simple as what went well. What did we learn and what we can do what can we improve for tomorrow? I do like the idea of also including you know some practices. I guess we can kind of try to find a way of unifying that into activities or tasks like do they have a habit of checking in because otherwise then the whole system doesn't work right so there's that at least and then you know, journaling, meditation, and gratitude. They're thicker cooking dinner like what's something that can be a meaningful moments that they connect with in a day and maybe it can be derived from some potential policies and then they could just start recognizing like when they are doing the things that they that this is my meaningful moment because and it becomes clearer and we're strengthening the awareness of what is meaningful for them and why, and strengthening that path from unconscious habit of things to why it's meaningful to increase that salience and to support the ability to think of ways of bringing that quality of attention to other spaces.\n\nHere's a coaching model we can take some ideas from and see how they already map to our system.

The key is to use techniques that reduce cognitive load while preserving essential information:\nUse analogies and metaphors to connect new concepts to familiar ones312.\nBreak down complex ideas into smaller, more manageable chunks3.\nCreate a hierarchical structure, starting with core concepts and adding layers of detail19.\nFor example, the \"mental frameworks\" approach proposed by recent cognitive science research suggests organizing thinking skills into structured patterns that can be applied across domains19. This allows for simplification while maintaining the depth needed for complex problem-solving.\nWhat's the minimum viable documentation?\nBased on recent coaching and personal growth literature, a streamlined documentation approach might include:\nDaily check-in: Current state/energy, active patterns, available support14.\nWeekly review: Pattern evolution, support effectiveness, next growth edges14.\nMonthly reflection: Growth review, system adjustment, direction setting14.\nThis minimal structure aligns with cognitive psychology principles of spaced repetition and reflection, which have been shown to enhance learning and personal development39.\nWhich patterns matter most?\nRecent research in psychology and coaching highlights several key patterns:\nCAP/CAP competition (value tensions)14\nCAP/IAP blocking (practical challenges)14\nSupport effectiveness (what helps)14\nGrowth edges (what's emerging)14\nThese patterns align with the concept of \"mental frameworks\" in cognitive psychology, which suggests that recognizing and navigating these recurring patterns can significantly enhance problem-solving and personal growth19.\nImplementation Questions\nHow to make transitions smoother?\nRecent coaching research suggests a three-step approach for smoother transitions:\nRecognition: Identify signals showing transition need\nMovement: Create steps allowing natural flow\nIntegration: Develop ways to embody change and support stability14\nThis approach aligns with cognitive psychology research on schema adaptation and the importance of gradual, structured change for effective learning and development19.\nBest way to track progress:\nCombining insights from cognitive psychology and coaching research, effective progress tracking might include:\nRegular check-ins with clear markers\nStory-based evidence collection\nPattern recognition documentation\nSupport system evaluation14\nThis multi-faceted approach leverages the power of narrative in cognitive processing and the importance of systematic reflection in personal growth39.\nHow to measure effectiveness:\nRecent research in psychology and coaching suggests measuring effectiveness through:\nObservable behavior changes\nEmotional state shifts\nPattern resolution success\nSupport system usage14\nThese metrics align with cognitive psychology's emphasis on behavioral outcomes and emotional regulation as key indicators of personal growth and learning919.\nIntegration Questions\nHow do support systems evolve?\nBased on recent coaching and personal growth literature, support systems evolve through:\nTriggers: Pattern shifts, new needs emerging, effectiveness changes\nAdjustments: Container modifications, practice updates, resource additions\nVerification: User feedback, observable changes, pattern shifts14\nThis evolution process aligns with cognitive psychology principles of adaptive learning and the importance of feedback loops in personal development19.\nWhen to update attention policies:\nRecent research suggests updating attention policies:\nWhen they no longer feel magnetic\nWhen new patterns emerge\nWhen support needs change\nWhen growth edges appear14\nThis approach reflects cognitive psychology's understanding of attention as a dynamic process that requires regular recalibration based on changing internal and external factors19.\nHow to know what's working:\nCombining insights from psychology and coaching, effective evaluation includes:\nDirect user feedback\nObservable pattern changes\nEmotional state shifts\nNatural integration signs14\nThis multi-faceted approach aligns with cognitive psychology's emphasis on both subjective experience and objective outcomes in assessing personal growth and learning effectiveness919.]]]\n\nLet's review everything and analyse similarly as above and come up with a new evolution of the system prompt identifying CAPs for the system prompt designer and to see what they would say about each section of the system prompt.
