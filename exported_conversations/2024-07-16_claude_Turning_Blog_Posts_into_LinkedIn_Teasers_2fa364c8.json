This report outlines how the program participants not only persevered but also fostered resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG). Our findings suggest that structured social support and deliberate reflection can significantly enhance resilience in social entrepreneurs, even amid extreme adversity.\nIntroduction\n2020 was a year of extraordinary challenges globally, with Lebanon facing particularly severe hardships. As we ran the ACSI program with teams across Lebanon, we encountered a combination of crises:\nGlobal COVID-19 pandemic\nSevere economic downturn\nPolitical instability\nResource shortages\nRising unemployment\nThe catastrophic Beirut Port explosion\n \nThese events profoundly impacted our participants, with some team members physically injured affected by the port explosion. Despite these challenges, the ACSI program continued, adapting to provide crucial support during this tumultuous period.\n\nSocial Entrepreneurship support organizations, like Bloom, are working in an age of seemingly accelerating incidences of social, political, and environmental challenges. Thus, identifying the factors that promote post-traumatic growth (PTG) is critical.\nProgram Approach\nThe ACSI program employed several key strategies:\nPrinciples-based training: We focused on values and core principles rather than rigid methodologies, allowing for flexibility in application.\nQuantitative/Qualitative data and reflection: Using the Values In Action Character Profile(VIA) - a psychometrically validated tool - helped us assess and support participants' character strengths.\nRegular convening circles: We maintained consistent check-ins, even in the immediate aftermath of the port explosion, fostering a supportive community.\nResearch Findings\nOur research compared ACSI participants with a control group of individuals who were assessed but unable to participate in the program. Key findings include:\nEnhanced resilience: ACSI participants demonstrated greater resilience facing acute challenges.\nPositive impact of social support: Regular check-ins and a supportive community correlated with improved coping mechanisms.\nImportance of deliberate rumination: Structured reflection on experiences contributed to personal growth.\nCharacter strength development: Participants showed growth in traits associated with PTG, such as Hope, Persistence, and Gratitude.\nThe Values In Action (VIA) assessment offers a unique perspective on psychological measurement. While traditionally Psychological measures measure what goes wrong, the VIA identifies what works well in a flourishing life. We used this psychometrically validated instrument to assess teams before the ACSI accelerator program and after the program's completion.\n \nAdditionally, we assessed a control group of teams who were unable to participate in the program. Our findings revealed a difference: teams who participated in the ACSI program demonstrated greater resilience when facing acute challenges. This observation led us to a crucial question: What specific aspects of the ACSI program contributed to this enhanced resilience?\nDiving into the literature, we found connections between social support, asking meaningful questions, and PTG. \nImplications for Social Entrepreneurship Support\nWhile traumatic events can destabilize the status quo by disrupting our worldview, how we reconstruct those narratives is critically important. The ACSI program's design provided a framework for positive narrative reconstruction, even in the face of severe challenges. \n \nThe originators of the concept of PTG, Tedeschi, and Calhoun, identify Deliberate Rumination and Positive Social Support as important factors in promoting the possibility of growth after a difficulty. We believe one of the reasons teams in the ACSI program fared better is that we developed a “pre-resilience” habit of holding a space where important questions are raised in a socially supportive setting, our check-in circles.\nLimitations and Future Research\nIt's important to note that while many people experience PTG after difficulty, it's not universal or expected from everyone. Factors such as prior life experiences, personal schemas, and individual differences play significant roles.\n \nOur study's limitations include:\nSmall sample size\nFocus on a specific geographic and cultural context\nRelatively short timeframe for observing long-term effects\n \nFuture research could explore:\nLarger-scale studies across diverse contexts\nLongitudinal studies to assess long-term impacts\nComparative studies of different support methodologies\n \nWe welcome collaboration opportunities with other organizations to expand this research. \nRecommendations for Organizations\nBased on our findings, we recommend the following actions for social impact accelerators, educational institutions, and businesses:\n\nImplement Regular Check-ins:\nEstablish consistent times for team or community gatherings.\nExample: Establish regular check-in sessions where participants share challenges and successes.\nFoster Deliberate Reflection:\nIncorporate structured reflection activities into programs.\nDevelop Personal and Professional Strengths\nUse assessments and activities to help people identify personal and professional strengths. \nExample: Consider using the VIA assessment to identify and nurture key traits and measure flourishing.\nCreate Supportive Communities:\nFacilitate peer support networks within and beyond formal program structures.\nConclusion and Call to Action\nThe ACSI program's experience during 2020 demonstrates the potential for entrepreneurship training programs to go beyond business skills, fostering resilience and personal growth. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, organizations can create more supportive, resilient, and growth-oriented environments for social entrepreneurs.\n\nWe invite other organizations to join us in this important work. By fostering resilience and PTG, we can build a community of social entrepreneurs better equipped to drive positive change, taking care of themselves, others, and their mission - even in the face of significant adversity.\n\nTo learn more about implementing these recommendations, please sign up here.\n\nTogether, we can unlock human potential for positive change and ensure our teams thrive while creating lasting social impact. We will soon share practical and easy ways to bring these important qualities into your program, stay tuned."

            "extracted_content": "ACSI End of Program Report Addendum\n\nCharacter Strengths and \nFostering Post-Traumatic Growth\n\nEnd of Program Addendum \n2020 brought many challenges to the already challenging field of Social Entrepreneurship. Especially in Lebanon, with the global pandemic, on top of local challenges of the economic collapse, political instability, shortages of foods and medicines, unemployment and the August 2020 explosion at the port of Beirut. \nIn our programs, and for impact monitoring, we utilize the Values in Action Character profile (VIA). The VIA offers perspectives on aspects of being that make life worthwhile, and supports us in finding ways to help bring out people’s strengths in pursuit of their social entrepreneurial aims.\nOur research found that wellbeing and life satisfaction correlate with self-efficacy and productivity factors. The more teams feel resourced to face the challenges of life and work, even in chaotic times, the better the outcomes for the teams and their social initiatives. \nBloom's research team is currently conducting qualitative and quantitative research to contextualize the changes seen within the Character Strengths of our participants. Reviewing the data in the context of the challenges that people in Lebanon have faced over the last year, the question was raised: How our programs may have had an impact on the people who were part of our programs? We are interviewing participants that went through the full 6 month (originally planned as 4 month) Accelerator Program (May-October 2020) and those who only went through the 2 week Sprint Program (in April 2020) to deepen the understanding of how people respond to and grow through challenging situations and how those responses differ within a program and outside a program. We’re doing this to identify better the factors which lead to Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG is defined below) to then include these factors more deeply into our programming.\nThis document describes a recently identified buffering effect for participants within the ACSI program on the measure of Character Strengths overall and a more substantial buffering effect on factors relating to Wellbeing and Life Satisfaction. \nPost-Traumatic Stress vs Post-Traumatic Growth\nTrauma and the accompanying stressors that persist do impact many people who go through an acute traumatic event, like the blast that went off in Beirut last year, or sustained challenges such as those emerging from the pandemic, economic collapse, and others. Individuals may have trouble concentrating, flashbacks, sensitivity to similar situations, and other negative experiences that develop after a traumatic event are called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD). The research shows that after a traumatic event, there are three main responses: \nA small percentage of people who experience it develop PTSD, \nThe majority of people show resilience and return to the pre-event state, \nAnother minority demonstrates something called Post Traumatic Growth. \n\n(Jeon 2015)\nIn Post-Traumatic Growth, following a period after a traumatic event that is spent grappling with the challenges - there is a period of growth whereby people develop new strengths, see new possibilities, develop spiritually, develop closer relationships, and a deeper appreciation for life. \nThese days, more programs are becoming trauma-informed and are adapting accordingly, but there is little inclusion of this in entrepreneurship programs, and little research focusing on how entrepreneurship programs can better support communities during and after traumatic events, and better support post-traumatic growth. In an age of disruption and “new normals” understanding what supports PTG is critical.\nEvidence from the ACSI Program\nTo explore this further in the context of our programs, we have recently analyzed the Character Strengths profiles of people who went through our ACSI Sprint+Accelerator program, versus those who just went through the ACSI Sprint Program. For this cohort of participants, we have basic quantitative data that was collected at the beginning of the Sprint period (in April 2020). A subset of teams was then selected for the longer 4-month Accelerator program, which was extended to six months due to the challenges in Lebanon and beyond. It’s important to note that these are small scale studies with 13 participants within our accelerator program and 17 participants within the Sprint only program. \nThe same quantitative assessment was conducted in December 2020-January 2021, with the initial results shared here. Follow-on qualitative interviews will be conducted in the following two months.\nFrom an aggregated view, the ACSI program seemed to prevent a drop in overall character strengths. We collected samples of the ACSI Sprinters character Strengths profile at the beginning of the program during the sprint period. We re-assessed again for both people who participated only in the sprint and participants who completed the ACSI Accelerator program. By comparing the pre/post changes across all 24 Character Strengths, we see that the ACSI teams had a small .2 point increase in their aggregated scores compared to the teams not a part of the Accelerator program who experienced a .6 point drop.\n\nThis exploration led to identifying that the impact of our program had a more substantial buffering effect on the facets that supported Life-Satisfaction and Wellbeing:\nTrait\nCorrelation w/ Wellbeing\nCorrelation w/ Life Satisfaction\nChange / Accelerator For Accel Teams\nChange / Accelerator For Non-Accel Teams\nBuffering effect\nHope\nr = .30\nr = .53\n-0.04\n-1.43\n1.39\nLove\nr = .18\nr = .35\n-0.27\n-1.84\n1.57\nHumor\nr = .25\nr = .26\n1.12\n-0.55\n1.67\nCuriosity\nr = .25\nr = .39\n0.96\n-0.52\n1.48\nZest\nr = .34\nr = .52\n0.35\n-0.77\n1.11\nGratitude\nr = .21\nr = .43\n-0.15\n-0.73\n0.58\nAverage\nr = .26\nr = .41\n0.12\n-0.58\n1.25\n\n\nIt is interesting to note is the development of humor within our programs, humor has been linked to adaptive coping and keeping a light attitude in the face of adversity (Ruch and Hofmann 2017). \n\nData on Wellbeing from: (Gander, F., Hofmann 2019)\nData on Life Satisfaction from: Park, N., Peterson, C., & Seligman, M.

Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology,\nPrevious studies have also proposed a subset of character traits that support enterprise and have preliminarily identified the following traits to be correlated with successful entrepreneurs:\nCharacter Strength\nChange Over Accelerator Period For Accel Teams\nChange Over Accelerator Period For Non- Accel Teams\nBuffering Effect of Programming\nAuthenticity\n-0.65\n-1.82\n1.17\nLeadership\n0.00\n-1.75\n1.75\nZest\n0.35\n-0.77\n1.11\nGratitude\n-0.15\n-0.73\n0.58\nFairness\n0.73\n-1.32\n2.05\nAverage of above\n0.05\n-1.28\n1.33\n\n\n\nWe can see that for all the factors relevant to Wellbeing, Life-Satisfaction, and the factors associated with successful venture founders teams fared better within our programs. \n\nCorrelates\nEnt= Entrepreneurship\nWB=Wellbeing\nLS=Life Satisfaction\nTrait\nChange / Accelerator For Accel Teams\nChange / Accelerator For Non Accel Teams\nBuffering effect\nImpact LS+WB\nImpact Ent\nPotential WB+LS\nTotal Impact\nEnt & WB/LS\nZest\n0.35\n-0.77\n1.12\n0.48\n1.12\n0.86\n0.801\nEnt & WB/LS\nHope\n-0.04\n-1.43\n1.39\n0.58\n1.13\n0.83\n0.852\nWB/LS\nCuriosity\n0.96\n-0.52\n1.48\n0.47\n-0.23\n0.64\n0.351\nEnt & WB/LS\nGratitude\n-0.15\n-0.73\n0.58\n0.19\n-0.10\n0.64\n0.145\nWB/LS\nLove\n-0.27\n-1.84\n1.57\n0.42\n0.48\n0.53\n0.450\nWB/LS\nHumor\n1.12\n-0.55\n1.67\n0.43\n-0.47\n0.51\n0.448\nEnt\nPersistence\n2.37\n-0.82\n3.19\n0.73\n1.85\n0.46\n1.292\nEnt\nBravery\n0.75\n-0.29\n1.04\n0.19\n0.48\n0.37\n0.336\nEnt\nAuthenticity\n-0.65\n-1.82\n1.17\n0.20\n0.36\n0.34\n0.279\nEnt\nLeadership\n0.00\n-1.75\n1.75\n0.28\n0.76\n0.32\n0.522\nNone\nFairness\n0.73\n-1.32\n2.05\n0.27\n-0.32\n0.26\n0.291\n\n\nThe table above indicates the traits the Research team is putting forward to explore deeper integration into programming. Gratitude is interesting due to the fact that it has high correlation with wellbeing and life satisfaction while it was one of the traits that the program has room to improve on. Hope and Persistence have been demonstrated to be malleable Character Strengths (Gander 2019) and also have high correlations with Entrepreneurial Success (Worell 2011) as well as Life Satisfaction (Park, N., Peterson, C., & Seligman 2004) and Wellbeing (Gander 2019). We hypothesize the combination of the malleability of the trait along with correlations with factors that can support entrepreneurs make these traits good candidates for strengthening over the course of a program.\nPractical Program Applications of our Hypotheses\nA key objective of our programmatic approach in Bloom is to combine these critical aspects of character and universal skills development into our entrepreneurial support programs, since success of social impact and traditional enterprises is intimately connected to the capacities of the team, especially founding and early team, of an enterprise. The more effective programs can be on both enterprise and personal development factors, the more impactful the programs can be both in the short-term and long-term. This is even more critical in emerging ecosystems and marginalized/vulnerable communities where character and skill development opportunities are less available, and where exposure to acute and sustained traumatic experiences are more common.\nFurther Exploration\nFurther exploration will be how to deepen the factors supporting these traits and engender post-traumatic growth for an age of instability and chaos. Some of the factors that are correlated with increased potential for Post Traumatic Growth are Social Support as well as Deliberate Rumination (Morris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J. 2011). \n\n(Morris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J. 2011). \nThe programmatic implications of the factor analysis above along with the assessment of strengths open lines of inquiry about the potential benefit of making conscious the discussion of strengths. Deliberate Rumination is the process of choosing the questions and thoughts one has around a traumatic event, for instance “what is the lesson I am learning through this” in contrast with Intrusive Rumination and Brooding which may take the tone of “why is this always happening to me”. \nIncluding moments of Deliberate Rumination in a social setting where trust is first established can potentially support PTG. Including a focus on Strengths which support individuals' sense of life satisfaction and overall wellbeing is hypothesized to set a state of mind conducive to positive Deliberate Rumination. A traumatic event is destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image and worldviews, the possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and positive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014). Over the course of one’s life the majority (> 60% across many countries) of people will experience an event which they report as traumatic (Scott, K. M., Koenen 2013). \n\nThe chart above shows that traumatic events offer a transformational potential for individuals. Bloom believes that Social Entrepreneurship programs can provide the scaffolding that can support the development of PTG, personal growth and positive societal impact. By engaging individuals with New Possibilities (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman) through their enterprises, offering positive social support, facilitating moments of collective positive rumination, as well as making visible and encouraging growth of the Character Strengths which promote life satisfaction and wellbeing. Programs which take this into consideration are hypothesized to support individuals going through trauma and create framing which help guide them towards becoming personal transformational experiences that lead to societal transformational experiences.  \n\n(Roepke, A. M., & Seligman 2014)\n\nThank you for the opportunity to deepen our understanding of character strengths through the ACSI program, and we welcome further discussion on sharing knowledge and data on trauma informed social entrepreneurship programming across all Asfari programs. \nReferences: \nMorris, B.

This work was inspired by our experiences with social entrepreneurs affected by the Beirut blast, where we observed both the painful impact and the unexpected resilience within our program communities.\nExamining the literature and our data, we found deliberate rumination, social support, and narrative reappraisal are key factors in promoting post-traumatic growth (PTG). Interestingly, our pre/post assessments of teams Values in Action Character Profile showed that humor had the strongest connection with PTG. We believe humor's ability to diffuse stress, unblock the freeze response, open possibility spaces, and foster cognitive flexibility aligns with the skills needed for creative problem-solving in challenging situations.\nWhile check-in questions can vary to serve your organization's goals, we encourage incorporating questions that spark deliberate rumination and community building. These factors promote creativity, growth, and resilience by encouraging realistic, growth-oriented reappraisal of situations and narrative formation.\nWe believe that entrepreneurship programs, especially for social impact entrepreneurs working in difficult areas, can provide a valuable home for these discussions. It's essential to establish a space that builds meaningful relationships and provides framing for navigating transitions.\nUse these questions in your programs, classrooms, or even with your family at breakfast. They should be fun, help develop deeper relationships, and spark creativity. They touch on many of the factors which promote Post Traumatic Growth, including reappraising past difficulties, creating empowered narratives, identifing ways forward, celebrating achievements, and recognizing new opportunities. We did our best to blend reflection on past experiences with humor in daily reflections, take these as a starting point and mix in the features above to give them your own unique twist.\n**Unexpected Positives and Empowered Narratives:**\n1. What's a surprise from your past that makes you smile?\n2. What past challenge did you overcome that seemed insurmountable at first?\n3. If a past mishap were a plot twist in your superhero origin story, how did it turn you into a champion?\n**Ways Forward and Celebrating Achievements:** 4. What small step did you take in the past that felt like a giant leap for mankind (or at least for you)? 5. What's your 'I nailed it!' moment from the past week? Even if it's just resisting the urge to snooze the alarm?\n**New Opportunities and Silver Linings:** 6. What's a new door that opened for you given the situation, even if it was just a crack and you had to squeeze through? 7. How can you turn a past challenge into a silver lining?\n**Perspective Shifts and Shared Laughter:** 8. What's the funniest thing about a recent or historic challenge you faced? 9. What past moment made you laugh so hard you forgot you were supposed to be stressed? 10. What's something you took seriously in the past but laugh about now?\n**Transforming Past Challenges and Finding Light Moments:** 11. How can you turn a past failure into a funny story that makes you laugh now? 12. What hard-won lesson from the past can you apply to today's challenges with a touch of humor?\nThese questions are designed to touch upon factors that promote post-traumatic growth, including sharing emotions, cognitive processing, positive reappraisal, and committing to growth actions. By incorporating them into your daily or weekly routines, you can foster an environment that supports resilience, creativity, and positive growth, in the face of significant challenges or just any old regular Monday.",

Interestingly, our pre/post assessments of teams Values in Action Character Profile showed that humor had the strongest connection with PTG. We believe humor's ability to diffuse stress, unblock the freeze response, open possibility spaces, and foster cognitive flexibility aligns with the skills needed for creative problem-solving in challenging situations.\nWhile check-in questions can vary to serve your organization's goals, we encourage incorporating questions that spark deliberate rumination and community building. These factors promote creativity, growth, and resilience by encouraging realistic, growth-oriented reappraisal of situations and narrative formation.\nWe believe that entrepreneurship programs, especially for social impact entrepreneurs working in difficult areas, can provide a valuable home for these discussions. It's essential to establish a space that builds meaningful relationships and provides framing for navigating transitions.\nUse these questions in your programs, classrooms, or even with your family at breakfast. They should be fun, help develop deeper relationships, and spark creativity. They touch on many of the factors which promote Post Traumatic Growth, including reappraising past difficulties, creating empowered narratives, identifing ways forward, celebrating achievements, and recognizing new opportunities. We did our best to blend reflection on past experiences with humor in daily reflections, take these as a starting point and mix in the features above to give them your own unique twist.\n**Unexpected Positives and Empowered Narratives:**\n1. What's a surprise from your past that makes you smile?\n2. What past challenge did you overcome that seemed insurmountable at first?\n3. If a past mishap were a plot twist in your superhero origin story, how did it turn you into a champion?\n**Ways Forward and Celebrating Achievements:** 4. What small step did you take in the past that felt like a giant leap for mankind (or at least for you)? 5. What's your 'I nailed it!' moment from the past week? Even if it's just resisting the urge to snooze the alarm?\n**New Opportunities and Silver Linings:** 6. What's a new door that opened for you given the situation, even if it was just a crack and you had to squeeze through? 7. How can you turn a past challenge into a silver lining?\n**Perspective Shifts and Shared Laughter:** 8. What's the funniest thing about a recent or historic challenge you faced? 9. What past moment made you laugh so hard you forgot you were supposed to be stressed? 10. What's something you took seriously in the past but laugh about now?\n**Transforming Past Challenges and Finding Light Moments:** 11. How can you turn a past failure into a funny story that makes you laugh now? 12. What hard-won lesson from the past can you apply to today's challenges with a touch of humor?\nThese questions are designed to touch upon factors that promote post-traumatic growth, including sharing emotions, cognitive processing, positive reappraisal, and committing to growth actions. By incorporating them into your daily or weekly routines, you can foster an environment that supports resilience, creativity, and positive growth, in the face of significant challenges or just any old regular Monday.",

Arrange participants in a circle or in small groups of 4-6 people.\n2. Place the question cards face down in the center or have a facilitator hold them.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Part 1: Question Roulette (30-40 minutes)\n\n1. Explain the activity: \"We're going to practice using questions that promote resilience and growth. Each person will draw a card, read the question aloud, and answer it. Then, they'll pass the turn to someone else.\"\n\n2. Set the ground rules:\n   - Listen actively and respectfully\n   - Keep answers concise (about 1-2 minutes)\n   - It's okay to pass if a question feels too personal\n\n3. Begin the roulette:\n   - The first person draws a card and reads the question aloud\n   - They answer the question (facilitator can use a timer for 1-2 minutes)\n   - After answering, they choose the next person (can toss the ball if using one)\n   - Continue until everyone has answered at least one question\n\n### Part 2: Reflection and Application (15-20 minutes)\n\n4. After the roulette, facilitate a brief discussion:\n   - Which questions did you find most impactful? Why?\n   - How did answering these questions make you feel?\n   - How might these questions foster resilience and growth?\n\n5. Application exercise:\n   - In pairs or small groups, have participants choose one question and brainstorm how they could incorporate it into their own programs or daily routines\n   - Share ideas with the larger group\n\n## Question Set\n(Shuffle these and use as many as time allows)\n\n1.

Upside-Down Pyramid Worksheet\n\nThroughout both days:\n- Encourage participants to use humor and levity when appropriate\n- Model and practice deliberate rumination with positive framing\n- Emphasize the connection between personal growth and social impact\n\nPost-workshop:\n- Set up a follow-up session after 1 month to discuss implementation experiences\n- Provide an email address or forum for participants to share their experiences and ask questions as they apply these tools in their programs\n</antArtifact>\n\nThis revised workshop outline focuses specifically on the three tools you mentioned: the Strength-Based Problem Solving worksheet, the Deliberate Rumination Tool, and the Upside-Down Pyramid worksheet. Here are the key features of this updated structure:\n\n1. Focused Content: The workshop now revolves around these three core tools, allowing for deeper exploration and practice with each.\n\n2. Balanced Structure: Each tool is given significant time for introduction, practice, and discussion.\n\n3. Interactive Elements: The outline includes individual work, paired activities, and group discussions to engage participants in various ways.\n\n4. Application Emphasis: Participants are encouraged to apply these tools to their own real-world challenges and projects.\n\n5. Continued Learning: The post-workshop resources and follow-up session support ongoing implementation of the tools.\n\n6. Flexibility: While more focused, the outline still allows for adjustment based on the group's needs and responses.\n\nThis structure provides a more targeted experience, deeply exploring the three key tools while still maintaining the overall goals of fostering resilience and post-traumatic growth. It allows participants to gain hands-on experience with each tool and consider how to implement them in their own work.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any part of this outline or make any further adjustments?",
