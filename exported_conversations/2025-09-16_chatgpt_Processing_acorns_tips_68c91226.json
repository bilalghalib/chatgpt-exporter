      "content": "Should I dry acorns before trying to process them? What's the easiest way to process acorns? Some of them are kind of wet. Should I crack them? Is it easier to peel like that? They're also long and they have like these really spiky kind of acorn tops. I'll send you a picture. Can you tell me which kind of acorn it is as well? Maybe it'll help me know if I should even process it. They are large. That's the exciting thing to me. The reason why I want to process them is because there's a lot of material inside. I keep thinking, that's such a waste.",

      "content": "Good thinking — big acorns can indeed yield a lot of flour or nutmeat, but how you process them depends on **which oak species** they come from and how tannic (bitter) they are.  \n\nHere’s the step-by-step basics for your situation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Should you dry them first?\n- **If they’re freshly fallen and wet/soft:** dry them a little before cracking. Acorns mold quickly, so spread them in a single layer somewhere airy, out of direct sun, for a few days.  \n- **If they’re already firm/hard:** you can start processing right away, but drying first makes shelling easier and improves storage.\n\n👉 Rule of thumb: dry to avoid mold, but don’t overdry before cracking — super dry shells can become very tough to open.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Cracking & peeling\n- Crack the shell with a nutcracker/hammer/rock.  \n- The **testa (brown skin around the nut)** is the fiddly part — sometimes it comes off easily, sometimes not.  \n  - **Dry acorns** → skin usually flakes off easier.  \n  - **Boiling acorns briefly** (1–2 min) loosens the skin.  \n  - **Freezing then thawing** also helps the skin pop off.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Leaching tannins (the bitter stuff)\nMost acorns are bitter unless leached. Two main methods:  \n- **Cold water leach (best for flour):** Chop nuts into small bits, soak in cold water, changing the water daily until it no longer turns brown and tastes mild.  \n- **Boiling water leach (faster, less work):** Boil in lots of water, dump the brown water, refill, repeat until mild.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. What to make\n- **Roasted snack nuts** (if low tannin).  \n- **Acorn flour** (after drying & grinding the leached nutmeats) → breads, pancakes, noodles.  \n- **Coffee substitute** (roast chunks, brew like chicory).  \n\n---\n\n### 5. The “spiky caps” clue\nLong acorns with **shaggy, hairy, or spiky caps** are often from **Turkey oak (Quercus cerris)** or related species.  \n- These tend to be **very high in tannins**, so they’re not eaten raw.  \n- People do process them, but they need **lots of leaching**.  \n- The upside: they’re large → more yield if you’re patient.  \n\nA clear picture of the nut + cap would help me confirm the species — there are a few with “fringed” acorn cups.  \n\n---\n\n✅ My suggestion for you right now:  \n- Spread them out to dry a few days (so they don’t mold).  \n- Crack a few, try leaching small batches both ways (cold soak vs. boiling) and taste test.  \n- If they’re still very bitter after several water changes, you’ve likely got a high-tannin oak, but they’re still usable for flour.  \n\n---\n\nWant to send me that picture of the acorns + their caps? Then I can likely ID the oak species for you and give you a more specific “worth it or not” answer.",
