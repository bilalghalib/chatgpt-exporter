There are no words that can fully express the depth of what we're going through right now. Losing Dad has left a void in our lives that seems impossible to fill.\n\nI want you to know that you're not alone in this. The love you and Dad shared was a beacon of light for our family, and that light continues to shine through the memories we hold dear. Your strength has always been an inspiration to me, and I know that strength will carry you through this difficult time, even when it feels overwhelming.\n\nPlease remember that it's okay to grieve, to cry, and to take the time you need to process this loss. There's no right or wrong way to feel right now. I'm here for you, whether you need a shoulder to cry on, someone to reminisce with about Dad, or just silent company.\n\nDad's love for you was immeasurable, and the life you built together was beautiful. He would want us to support each other and find moments of joy, even in our sorrow. Let's honor his memory by holding onto the lessons he taught us and the love he gave us.\n\nI'm here for you, Mom. Whatever you need, whenever you need it. We'll get through this together, one day at a time.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n</antArtifact>\n\nI've created a draft of a letter for your mother. It expresses condolences, offers support, and acknowledges the deep love between your parents. Feel free to adjust any part of it to better reflect your personal feelings and relationship with your parents. \n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the letter or suggest ways to personalize it further?",
