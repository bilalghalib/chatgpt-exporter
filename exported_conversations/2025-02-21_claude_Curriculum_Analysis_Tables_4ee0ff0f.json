Today is all about getting to know each other, understanding the program, and setting the foundations for the next two weeks as you learn more about the market and your customers needs!\n1\n\n\n\nLET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER\u000b\nName?\nWhere you are from?\nTell us your idea.\nWhat’s your superpower?\n10 minutes: Share\n\nIntroductions:\nBefore we get started, I would like to introduce myself and get to know all of you a bit better. Let's quickly go around the room and share:\nYour name,\nWhere you are from,\nTell us a little bit about your idea.\nAnd finally, if you had a superpower, what would it be (flying, reading minds, shape shifting, etc…)?\n\nThe trainers should start first. Then, go around the room so each person can introduce themselves.\n2\n\n09:00 am Welcome + Introductions!\n09:30 am Five One Labs & Ignite\n10:30 am Design Sprint\n12:00 pm Group Lunch\n01:30 pm User Research\n04:30 pm Wrap up\nAGENDA\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nAgenda: Now that we all know each other a little better, let’s get into the agenda for the day.\nThis morning we will spend some time understanding Five One Labs, the program, and what exactly you will be doing over the two weeks. This will be an opportunity to clarify any questions you still have and give you some insights on what is in store ahead through a design sprint!\nGroup Lunch: At 12:00 we will take a break and get lunch together.\nThis afternoon we will come back and get into user research. This is the first major session we will have. Here we will define our research plan for the next few weeks! Tell us a little bit about your idea, what problem does it solve? Finally, we will wrap up around 4:30!\n\n3\n\nYES, AND….\n15 minutes: Icebreaker\n\n2 minutes: Explain the activity\nTrainers should conduct the “YES, AND…” Icebreaker\nMake teams of about 3-5\nState a problem or ask the group for a problem\nFor example:\nIt’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nIt is so hot outside, how can I get to and from work without sweating or ever feeling the heat?\n \n5 minutes: “No” technique:\nYou have 2 minutes to generate different crazy ideas to solve that problem. Generate as many as possible. But there is a rule! When one member in the team says an idea another one must say “no!” and come up with a completely different idea. This goes on and on until the 2 minutes are up. You have to do this quickly, let's see how many crazy ideas we will get.\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nUse an umbrella!\nNo! Build a tunnel to go directly inside!\nNo! make a waterproof suit that covers your whole body!\nNo! Build an overpass that my taxi/bus will drop me off under!\nNo! Have a drone float above my head to prevent water from touching me.\nNo!.....\n[2 minutes pass] Time is done!\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with.\n \n5 minutes: Now let’s try “yes and”:\nYou have 2 minutes again, and this time someone says an idea, and then someone else in the group must say “yes”, and add a feature to grow the idea to make the idea bigger. Is it clear? Let's do it\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nBuild a tunnel to go directly inside from where you get dropped off!\nYes! And have heat inside to keep you warm on cold days\nYes! And the heat system is controlled by an app on your phone that you can use to control the temperature where you are walking\nYes! And …..\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with\n\n3 minutes: Review + recap\nAsk them which one did they like and why? (yes and or no method)\nThen explain “yes and” is good because it’s positive, and it feels good when your friends agree with your idea, right? And you can build on top of it to create really good and complete ideas. You can go deeper and come up with things that you normally wouldn’t have discovered.\n“No” is also good, as it generates a wide variety of ideas. And in real life when you talk about your idea to someone not everybody is positive and will like your idea. Sometimes you have to say no!\n\nRecap: As a rule at Five One Labs, we try to use the “yes and” method. We want to build off and support each other.\n\n4\n\nDesign Sprint!\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\nOk great! I hope you had some fun and got to know the people sitting around you a little bit more.\nWe are now going to get into the first design thinking session of Ignite, the Design Sprint! We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources. But first, we will give you a little introduction to the Design curriculum and an overview of the design thinking methodology.\n5\n\n\nFeb. 2, 2020: Introduction to Design Thinking\nFeb. 2, 2020: User Research\nFeb. 16, 2020: Define the Problem\nFeb. 20, 2020: Creativity and Ideation\n\n\n\nDESIGN THINKING SCHEDULE\nApril 1\nIntro to design thinking\nApril 1\nApril 7\nApril 8\nUser research\nDefine the problem\nCreativity and ideation\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nQuickly give an overview of the 4 Design sessions they will have over the next two weeks.\nIntroduction to Design Thinking: We will focus on giving you a good understanding of design thinking and the human centered design process today through a design sprint. Starting this afternoon, we will talk about applying the Design Thinking methodology to your business.\nUser Research: We will go into creating a research plan for you to deeply understand your customers and their needs.\nReframe: Define the Problem: We will take all of our research, and clearly define the problem for your different customer types.\nCreativity and Ideation: Finally, we will generate solutions to your customers problems. Some of them might be your current ideas, but we hope to generate a wide variety of ideas that could all be potential solutions.\n6\n\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What is design thinking? Why is it useful?\nPotential answers:\nA way to take a messy problem and turn it into something much more clear and more ordered\nA way to enhance your creativity, build stronger, more innovative solutions\nTo build a deeper understanding of people\nHuman centered, iterative, collaborative, experiential\nThere is a bias towards action\nYou should work to embody these mindsets throughout the rest of this sprint\n\n7\n\nincreased creativity\nstronger solutions\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe trainer should recap points brought up on the previous slide answering “What is design thinking? Why is it useful?”\nA way to take a messy problem and turn it into something much more clear and more ordered\nA way to enhance your creativity, build stronger, more innovative solutions\nTo build a deeper understanding of people\nHuman centered, iterative, collaborative, experiential\nThere is a bias towards action\nYou should work to embody these mindsets throughout the rest of this sprint\n\n8\n\nCC, BY-NC-ND, ⓒ Joe Thorn\nDiscussion: 5 minutes\n\nAsk: Take a look at this photo – who can tell me what this girl needs? (gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc…\n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap\nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc…\nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses.\nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories.\nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.\nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times.\n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well.\n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning.\n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better). There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner.\n\nEveryone should now get into pairs.\n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved?\n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things?\n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs\nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box.\nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!! (alone)\nOffer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\nSend the entrepreneurs in the other room where prototyping supplies are laid out for them.\nHow might this solution fit into the context of your partner’s life?\nImprove and build out the concept you talked about\n17\n\nFEEDBACK\n20 minutes: Activity\n\n6 minutes: Feedback (3 mins each)\nRemember, your idea is not precious, feedback is just a way to learn more\nGenerate more feedback\nWrite down how they feel about it\nWatch how they use it, misuse it, what mistakes are they making, what doesn’t make sense, etc\nWrite down one new idea, one big question from feedback. Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\n \n10 minutes: Debrief\nHow did discussing and gathering feedback from the person change how your final solution looks?\nIf you had to make it for yourself, would it look the same as it did for your partner?\nWho ended up with something their partner really liked? Why? What about it stood out?\nWhat would you change in your next iteration?\nWhat part was most uncomfortable? What was most natural?\nHow was it as a user interacting with the prototype?\n\n18\n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nBriefly explain again how they just went through the whole design thinking process in under an hour\nExplain that during Ignite, we will go through the first 3 steps, and then the incubator we will do the last 2 steps\nWrap up for lunch\n\n19\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nAny Questions?]]]Stage 2: Module Scoring Prompt\nINSTRUCTIONS\nYou are a curriculum consultant specializing in integrating climate resilience into entrepreneurship training.

The most logical alignment for a Market Forces Affecting Business Efficiency slide would be in a different section, such as:\n\nCompetitive Benchmarking (Slides 10-13) → Where businesses analyze how competitors are adapting to cost and efficiency trends.\nBarriers to Entry (Slides 14-15) → Where external cost risks (energy, materials, regulations) could be discussed as challenges to entering the market.\nBudget Planning (Slides 16-19) → Where participants consider long-term cost-saving investments.\nAlternative Slide Recommendations\nInstead of forcing a market efficiency slide in Market Sizing, we can refine the most relevant slide topics:\n\n1. Revised Slide for Market Research (Slides 5-8)\nTitle: \"Identifying Market Trends & Growth Sectors\"\n👉 This aligns better with market sizing by focusing on how industry trends create market opportunities.\n\nContent:\n\nGrowing Markets: What industries are expanding due to technology, investment, or consumer shifts?\nNew Customer Demand: Are businesses and consumers shifting spending habits toward efficiency-focused solutions?\nGlobal vs. Local Trends: What external factors are influencing the market size?\nModification:\n\nAdd a small section: “Emerging Market Trends: Cost-Efficient & Resilient Business Models”\nHighlight Iraqi/KRI market trends, such as:\nGrowing demand for energy-efficient buildings\nIncreased investments in water-saving technologies\n2. New Slide for Competitive Benchmarking (Slides 10-13)\nTitle: \"How Businesses Adapt to Market Pressures\"\n\nContent:\n\nCost Reduction Strategies: How are competitors improving efficiency to lower costs?\nAdapting to Market Trends: What shifts are successful businesses making (e.g., energy use, sourcing, logistics)?\nCase Example: A local business that optimized operations and gained a cost advantage.\nModification:\n\nAdd a discussion question: “What cost factors do you see impacting your competitors? How are they adapting?”\nEnsure the slide ties into competitive advantage, not sustainability for its own sake.\n3. New Slide for Barriers to Entry (Slides 14-15)\nTitle: \"Hidden Costs & Risks of Market Entry\"\n\nContent:\n\nRising Operational Costs: Energy, raw materials, and logistics all affect profitability.\nRegulatory Requirements: What laws or standards must businesses meet?\nLong-Term Planning: How do smart businesses reduce their exposure to cost fluctuations?\nModification:\n\nInstead of making this a “green” slide, present real business challenges in Iraq/KRI.\nAsk: \"What external factors could increase your operating costs? How will you prepare?\"\nSummary of Slide Adjustments\nSlide Section\tNew or Modified Slide Title\tWhy This Works\nMarket Research (Slides 5-8)\t“Identifying Market Trends & Growth Sectors”\tEnsures the market sizing exercise includes real growth opportunities (including efficient business models).\nCompetitive Benchmarking (Slides 10-13)\t“How Businesses Adapt to Market Pressures”\tShows how successful businesses improve efficiency to reduce costs and stay competitive.\nBarriers to Entry (Slides 14-15)\t“Hidden Costs & Risks of Market Entry”\tHelps entrepreneurs recognize cost and regulatory risks before launching.\nWould you like me to draft one of these slides visually?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nhow does hidden costs and risks of market entry connect with the idea of barriers to entry? \nChatGPT said:\nGreat question! Barriers to entry are the challenges businesses face when entering a market, and hidden costs & risks are a subset of those barriers. The connection is as follows:\n\nHow \"Hidden Costs & Risks of Market Entry\" Relates to Barriers to Entry\nWhen entrepreneurs analyze barriers to entry, they usually think about:\n\nFinancial Barriers → Startup capital, operational costs\nLegal Barriers → Regulations, permits, taxes\nMarket Competition → Established competitors, market saturation\nKnowledge & Skills Barriers → Industry expertise, access to networks\n👉 Hidden costs & risks are often overlooked barriers that can threaten business success. These can include unexpected market forces like:\n\nFluctuating material & energy prices (affecting profitability)\nChanging regulations & compliance costs (e.g., energy efficiency requirements)\nSupply chain disruptions (delays in raw materials, rising transportation costs)\nSlide Concept: Hidden Costs & Risks as Barriers to Entry\nA new slide under Barriers to Entry (Slides 14-15) could be titled:\n\n\"Hidden Costs & Risks of Market Entry: What Entrepreneurs Overlook\"\nContent:\n\nUnexpected Financial Barriers\n\nRising energy costs increase production expenses\nMaterial price volatility affects profit margins\nHidden compliance costs (permits, environmental standards, safety regulations)\nMarket Risks\n\nShifting consumer demand: Customers moving toward cost-efficient, value-based businesses\nCompetitive pressure: Established businesses have cost advantages due to economies of scale\nDiscussion Question: What unexpected costs could affect your business? How will you plan for them?\n\nThis slide ensures that cost-related risks are framed as a business challenge, not just an environmental concern.\n\nWould this framing work for your audience? Would you like me to create a draft version of this slide?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan we keep the title somehow as a barrier? can you make the bullets for the slide and then some facilitator notes to help explain it to participants?\nChatGPT said:\nSlide Title:\n“Financial & Market Barriers to Entry: Hidden Costs & Risks”\n\nSlide Bullets (Participant-Facing Content)\n💰 Unexpected Financial Barriers\n\nRising Energy Costs → Increases production & operations expenses over time.\nMaterial Price Volatility → Fluctuations in raw materials & imports can reduce profit margins.\nCompliance & Regulation Costs → Unexpected permit fees, industry standards, or changing tax policies.\n📉 Market & Competitive Risks\n\nShifting Customer Preferences → Consumers & businesses may favor cost-efficient, risk-resilient companies.\nSupply Chain Disruptions → Delivery delays, rising transportation costs, or product shortages.\nEconomies of Scale → Large competitors can operate at lower costs per unit, creating pricing pressure.\n🔍 Key Question:\n\"What unexpected costs or risks could impact your business? How can you reduce exposure to these risks?\"\n\nFacilitator Notes (Guiding the Discussion)\n1. Why This Matters:\n\nMany entrepreneurs underestimate the real costs of launching and running a business.\nSome barriers (like permits or initial investment costs) are obvious, but long-term financial pressures (like rising fuel costs or changing regulations) often go unnoticed.\nThis slide helps participants think beyond basic startup costs and consider risks that could threaten profitability later.\n2. How to Lead Discussion:\n\nAsk participants: “What expenses have surprised you in past work or businesses?”\nHave them list one financial or market risk that could impact their business idea.\nGuide them in thinking about ways to prepare, e.g.,\nCan they find more stable suppliers?\nCan they build flexibility into pricing or contracts?\nShould they invest in efficiency measures to lower long-term costs?\n3. Transition to Next Activity:\n\nThis discussion sets up the budgeting exercise (Slides 16-19).\nEncourage participants to factor these risks into their financial planning in the next session.\nWhy This Works\n✅ Frames climate & market risks as financial challenges → Keeps focus on business resilience.\n✅ Practical & actionable → Encourages participants to proactively identify risks & plan solutions.\n✅ Smoothly integrates with next steps → Helps with budget planning & long-term business sustainability.\n\nWould you like a draft slide visual for this? 🚀\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan we make it a bit more consolidated and then make the other two slides i a similar way so that it's deeply integrated with similar titles to the context they're in so it feels seamless\nChatGPT said:\nRefined Slide Set for Seamless Integration\n👉 Goal: Keep the barriers business-focused, deeply integrating financial risk and efficiency as natural considerations in entrepreneurship.\n👉 Structure: Each slide is streamlined, aligned with the module, and follows a consistent flow for smooth participant experience.\n\nSlide 1: Financial & Market Barriers to Entry (Slides 14-15)\n💰 Hidden Costs That Challenge New Businesses\n\nRising Operating Costs – Energy, rent, and materials can eat into profits.\nUnexpected Compliance Costs – Permits, taxes, and legal fees may increase over time.\nCompetitive Cost Advantages – Bigger businesses benefit from bulk pricing and supplier deals.\n🛑 Market Risks\n\nChanging Customer Preferences – Demand shifts to cost-efficient, adaptable businesses.\nSupply Chain Uncertainty – Price fluctuations and import/export restrictions impact operations.\n🔍 Discussion: What are the biggest cost risks in your industry? How can you prepare for them?\n\nFacilitator Notes:\nWhy this matters: Helps entrepreneurs recognize financial threats before launch.\nKey framing: This is about business survival & resilience, not sustainability for its own sake.\nGuiding questions:\nHow can a small business compete with larger companies on costs?\nWhat cost risks have already affected similar businesses in your market?\nHow can you negotiate better terms with suppliers or adapt pricing strategies?\nSlide 2: Competitive Advantage & Cost Efficiency (Slides 10-13)\n📊 Why Some Businesses Stay Ahead\n\nCost-Saving Tactics – Lean operations, smart sourcing, and efficiency investments keep businesses profitable.\nCustomer Trust in Reliability – Businesses that control costs well offer consistent pricing & quality.\nFlexibility as an Edge – Adapting to cost pressures helps businesses outlast rigid competitors.\n🔍 Discussion: How are competitors managing costs effectively? What can you learn from them?\n\nFacilitator Notes:\nWhy this matters: Smart competitors invest in efficiency to stay profitable.\nKey framing: Understanding cost-saving strategies is part of competitive analysis.\nGuiding questions:\nWhich competitors have remained strong despite economic challenges?\nAre there cost-cutting strategies (bulk orders, supplier deals, digital automation) that small businesses can use?\nSlide 3: Financial Planning & Smart Growth (Slides 16-19)\n📈 Planning for Long-Term Profitability\n\nEfficient Spending – Identify high-impact investments that reduce long-term costs.\nBudgeting for Uncertainty – Build in financial buffers for price fluctuations.\nCost vs. Value – Not all expenses are bad—some investments improve profit margins over time.\n🔍 Discussion: Which expenses will help your business grow, and which are unnecessary risks?\n\nFacilitator Notes:\nWhy this matters: Helps participants differentiate smart investments vs. unnecessary costs.\nKey framing: Budgeting isn’t just about reducing costs—it’s about spending strategically.\nGuiding questions:\nWhich early investments will have long-term payoffs?\nAre there high-risk costs that could be reduced?\nHow do successful businesses manage cash flow wisely?\nWhy This Works\n✅ Deeply integrated into business training → Feels natural, not an \"extra sustainability\" add-on.\n✅ Consistent structure → Each slide frames risk & efficiency through a business lens.\n✅ Clear progression → Participants move from barriers → competitive advantages → budgeting smartly.\n\nWould you like draft slides to see the final look & feel? 🚀\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nfind a steamlined way to include some of these elements, what slide(s) could we add? \nWhat is green business?\nThe concept “green business” is composed of\ntwo elements – “green” and “business”. As\nall business, green business is about making\nmoney. But “green” means doing so while sus-\ntainably harnessing opportunities that nature\nholds, and without harming the environment.\nGreen business can be defined from two per-\nspectives: one relates to the output in the form\nof green products or services, while the other\nrelates to the process of an economic activity.\nThis means entrepreneurs can enter into the\n“green” business sector by either providing\nenvironmentally friendly products or services\nor through an environmentally friendly process\nor with the help of clean technologies which\nreduce any negative effects of the business.\nGreen\nProducts or\nServices\nGreen Business\nGreen\nProcess\nWhile a step-by-step approach of gradual\ngreening is usually most practical, ideally, as\nthe business matures, both its outputs as well\nas processes should become green.\nEXAMPLES OF GREEN BUSINESSES:\nGreen businesses may offer products or ser-\nvices that are explicitly green, often making\nuse of technological innovation…:\nWaste management business: A company\ninvolved in the collection and processing of\nwaste so it can be recycled, composted and\ndisposed of in a way that is as environmen-\ntally friendly as possible.\nRenewable energy company: A company in-\nvolved in the manufacturing, installation and\nservicing of solar panels to generate electric-\nity instead of generating it from non-renew-\nable sources.\n…Or, green businesses may operate in “stand-\nard” sectors offering mainstream products and\nservices, but may still be green because of the\noperational choices they have made:\nHair salon: A hair salon that uses dyes and styl-\ning products made of organic substances; has\ninstalled solar panels to provide electricity for\nthe operation of equipment; and has procured\nsecond-hand furniture and equipment.\nClothes manufacturer: A clothes manufactur-\ning company that uses organic cotton and dyes\nas raw material; that filters its waste-water in a\nway that it can be partly re-used for irrigation;\nand that has installed LED-lights.\nIn terms of greening processes, there are many\ndimensions of operations that should be con-\nsidered. The main pillars of greening process-\nes in businesses are outlined below:\nRECYCLING\nAND WASTE\nREDUCTION\nReduce • Reuse • Recycle\n• Separate waste •\nDispose in a suitable way\nENERGY\nAND WATER\nCONSERVATION\nSave heat and electricity •\nSave water • Use efficient\nequipment • Use only\nwhen needed • Source\nfrom renewable sources\nPOLLUTION\nPREVENTION\nUse low emission\nequipment • Operate\nefficiently • Use\ndegradable materials\nGREEN\nPROCUREMENT\nProcure environmentally\nsustainable and local\nmaterials/products •\nChoose suppliers that try\nto be environmentally\nfriendly\nGREEN\nDISTRIBUTION\nAvoid transport to far-\naway places • Use the\nmost sustainable method\nof transport • Choose\ndistributors that try to be\nenvironmentally friendly\nDECENT WORK\nProvide productive work,\na fair income, security\nin the workplace, social\nprotection, voice, and\nequality of opportunity\nand treatment\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 7\nYou will note that while the other pillars re-\nfer to the environmental dimensions of doing\nbusiness, the last pillar, “decent work”, re-\nfers to its social dimension. Because of their\ncontribution to broader development goals as\nwell as to guarantee business success, it is\nimportant that businesses consider both their\nenvironmental and social performance, as eco-\nnomic performance is linked to these. Green\nbusinesses therefore need to also provide “de-\ncent work”, that is, work that is productive and\ndelivers a fair income, social protection and\nvoice to workers; only that way will the busi-\nness function optimally.\nExercise:\nDecide whether the following businesses are\ngreen or not green. Then try to rank them in\nterms of greenness from most green (1) - to\nleast green (4).\nBUSINESS GREEN\nNOT\nGREEN\nNOT\nSURE\nGREEN-\nNESS\nRANK\nYOUR\nCOM-\nMENTS\nA bicycle\nmanufacturer\nthat uses\nsecond-hand\nparts to make\nthe bicycles\nA shoe man-\nufacturer that\nmakes shoes\nfor the export\nmarket\nA tourism\ncompany that\norganizes\njeep safaris\nin a nature\nreserve\nA juice-mak-\ning company\nthat has\nconverted to\nsolar energy\nNote: You will notice while doing the exercise\nthat it is not always easy to answer whether\na business is green or not, or to compare en-\nterprises in terms of their greenness. Often,\nbusinesses start with only a few changes that\nbegin their transformation into a greener busi-\nness than before, and they then continue to\nprogressively become greener. Initially, even a\nfew small changes are a step in the right di-\nrection!\n8 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n1.3 Why go green?\nThe benefits of green business\nThere is no doubt that green business is critical-\nly important for productive, healthy and sustain-\nable societies. As green businesses use limited\namounts of (or no) fossil fuels and have low (or no)\nemissions, they can play a key role in combating\nclimate change while contributing to growth and\nthe creation of decent and green jobs.\nBut apart from macro-level benefits, going green\nalso makes business sense for the entrepreneur.\nThe benefits of greener business include ac-\ncess to untapped markets, improved resource\nefficiency and cost savings, and improved pro-\nductivity of staff as a result of a cleaner and\nsafer working environment. These benefits are\nexplained in the section below.\nEXAMPLES OF THE BENEFITS OF\nA GREEN BUSINESS:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nAccess to markets, as clients increasingly\ndemand environmentally friendly products\nbecause of increased eco-awareness, but\nalso because of health reasons (greater\nsafety of non-toxic products) or financial\nreasons (lower operating cost).\nCost savings, as water, energy and other\nbills go down and as resource-use becomes\nmore efficient.\nAccess to support, both financial and\nnon-financial, as governments place in-\ncreasingly high importance on environ-\nmental considerations.\nHigher productivity due to a healthier\nworkforce whose ability to work is not com-\npromised by health hazards such as toxins\nin the workplace.\nA healthier surrounding environment in\nwhich the resources needed by the busi-\nness now and in the future are preserved.\nA growing market and\nincreased demand\nThere is an increased demand for green prod-\nucts and services for several reasons.\nIn their choice of products and services, be-\ncause of ethical concerns, customers are in-\ncreasingly interested in clean production pro-\ncesses, environmentally friendly inputs and\nthe way businesses dispose of their waste.\nIn addition, because clients are aware of the\nreduced operation cost of highly efficient prod-\nucts, the market is increasingly demanding\nproducts and services which are highly materi-\nal and energy efficient as well as environmen-\ntally friendly. This is not only because of re-\nduced costs for users but because of the added\nbenefits: energy efficient light bulbs reduce the\nusers’ electricity bill and require less frequent\nchanges; solar lanterns provide better and\ncleaner light as compared to kerosene lanterns\nwhile they can also be re-charged for free; and\nhighly efficient cell phone batteries which last\nfor one week are far more convenient for clients\nthan those that last for only one day.\nOrganic products and nature tourism are in de-\nmand because of the perceived health and lei-\nsure benefits for the clients. Clients consider\nfood that is free from pesticides and synthet-\nic additives to be a safer and healthier option\nthan non-organic food. Similarly, relaxing in\na nature resort with beautiful scenery is pre-\nferred to staying in a concrete block in a pol-\nluted environment.\nGreen enterprises offer environmentally friend-\nly innovations that can tap into this growing\nmarket demand.\nIncreased business efficiency and\ncost savings\nGoing green can reduce costs and improve the\nbusiness’ productivity (meaning that with the\nsame amount of inputs, it can produce more),\nmaking it more competitive. A business that re-\nduces its material costs, energy costs, water costs\nas well as other costs that might be incurred by\nwastage becomes more efficient, less costly and\nmore productive. For example, if the business is\nable to reduce electricity costs through energy\nefficient equipment or techniques, and thereby\nreduce its overall production cost, its profit mar-\ngin may grow or it may be able to reduce its price\nto attract new customers.\nA healthier and more productive\nworkforce\nWorkers in a green business will usually have\nless health problems than those in businesses\nwhich engage in environmentally damaging pro-\ncesses. For example, in enterprises that use toxic\nchemicals, indoor air pollution in the facilities\ncan cause both immediate health problems such\nas nausea, headaches and dizziness as well as\nlong-term health impacts like lung damage. If\nthese issues are resolved, less people will be sick\nand firm production processes will not be inter-\nrupted. With less disruptions, the business will\nnot lose time and resources. Workers will also be\nmore productive because they will not be worried\nabout health hazards. The greening of processes\ncan thus lead to less absences in the form of sick\nleave or a lower rate of discontinuation of work\ndue to serious health problems, and higher on-\nthe-job productivity as workers are able to work\nin a healthy state.\nAccess to financial incentives and\nother support measures\nDifferent countries have developed measures\nand policies to create a shift towards an econ-\nomy that has a reduced negative effect on the\nenvironment. Policies, laws, and regulations\nhave been developed to discourage tradition-\nal enterprises from high energy consumption,\nhigh pollution and high greenhouse gas emis-\nsions. In some countries, polluting activi-\nties may be subject to fines, and taxes may\nbe imposed on fuels such as petrol or diesel;\nshifting away from these thus makes financial\nsense. But more importantly, positive incen-\ntives are also increasingly being introduced to\nencourage greener business processes and to\nstimulate emerging green industries such as\nrenewable energy, eco-agriculture, and green\ntourism among others. Because of this, busi-\nnesses which go green are often able to benefit\nfrom a range of measures designed to encour-\nage the growth of the green business sector.\nThese may include, for example, tax reduc-\ntions, access to attractive financial products\nsuch as low-interest loans for green business,\nsubsidies for switching to new environmen-\ntally friendly technologies, or various types of\nnon-financial assistance such as training pro-\ngrammes.\nExercise:\nTry to brainstorm incentives and support meas-\nures that are available in your context for green\nbusinesses:\nTYPE OF\nINCENTIVE/\nSUPPORT\nAVAILABLE:\nWHO\nPROVIDES IT?\nWHO CAN\nACCESS IT?\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 9\nChatGPT said:\nStreamlined Slide Integration for Green Business Concepts\n👉 Approach: Integrate key green business principles where they naturally enhance business efficiency, risk reduction, and profitability rather than as standalone sustainability topics.\n👉 Placement: Align new slides with business strategy discussions so green concepts enhance competitiveness & financial resilience.\n\nSlide 1: Business Model Efficiency & Market Positioning (Slides 10-13, Competitive Benchmarking)\n📊 What Makes a Business Competitive in Today's Market?\n\nCost Efficiency & Smart Operations → Reducing waste, energy, and material costs boosts long-term profitability.\nCustomer-Driven Market Trends → Growing demand for cost-effective, high-value products (e.g., energy-efficient goods, durable products).\nStrategic Positioning → Businesses that streamline operations & optimize resource use gain a competitive edge.\n🔍 Discussion: What smart business decisions do competitors make to stay cost-effective and profitable?\n\nFacilitator Notes:\nWhy this matters: Helps participants see lean, efficient businesses as the strongest competitors.\nKey framing: Green strategies = cost-efficient operations rather than environmental compliance.\nGuiding questions:\nHow are competitors cutting costs through better sourcing, energy use, or waste reduction?\nWhat shifts in customer demand favor businesses that optimize resources?\nSlide 2: Strategic Cost Management & Risk Reduction (Slides 14-15, Barriers to Entry)\n🚀 Financial & Market Barriers: What Entrepreneurs Overlook\n\nHidden Costs That Affect Profitability\n\nEnergy & Material Price Fluctuations → Unpredictable costs can shrink margins.\nRegulatory Changes → Businesses may face compliance costs or financial penalties.\nInefficient Processes → High waste & poor planning = unnecessary expenses.\nHow Smart Businesses Reduce Risk\n\nInvesting in Cost Efficiency → Optimized operations protect against market volatility.\nBuilding Flexibility into Business Models → Adapting to external pressures (cost shifts, supply chain disruptions).\nStrategic Pricing & Customer Focus → Aligning with demand for reliable, low-maintenance products.\n🔍 Discussion: Which business risks could be managed by smarter cost decisions?\n\nFacilitator Notes:\nWhy this matters: Entrepreneurs need long-term strategies to manage unpredictable costs.\nKey framing: Smart financial planning & efficiency investments safeguard profits.\nGuiding questions:\nWhat operational inefficiencies could drain resources unnecessarily?\nAre there ways to lower long-term costs (bulk purchasing, energy efficiency, etc.)?\nSlide 3: Business Growth Through Smart Investments (Slides 16-19, Budget Planning)\n📈 Long-Term Profitability: Where Should You Invest?\n\nInvestments That Improve Business Resilience\n\nCost-Effective Equipment & Technology → Lowers energy & maintenance costs over time.\nResource Efficiency in Operations → Reduces overhead & ensures stable production costs.\nStrategic Supplier & Market Choices → Minimizes risks tied to market fluctuations.\nWhere to Cut Costs vs. Where to Spend Smartly\n\nShort-Term Savings vs. Long-Term Benefits → Not all cost-cutting leads to profitability.\nFlexible Pricing & Market Positioning → Capturing customer interest with durable, efficient products.\n🔍 Discussion: Which business investments pay off over time?\n\nFacilitator Notes:\nWhy this matters: Helps participants see efficiency investments as strategic, not extra expenses.\nKey framing: Profitability comes from wise spending, not just cutting costs.\nGuiding questions:\nWhat expenses now could save you money in the long run?\nWhat strategic investments make competitors more resilient?\nWhy This Works\n✅ Business-first language → No standalone \"green business\" section, just practical cost efficiency strategies.\n✅ Seamless module integration → Enhances market research, competitive strategy, and financial planning discussions.\n✅ Frames sustainability as profit-driven → Helps participants think long-term about costs & risks.\n\nWould you like draft visuals for these slides to see how they would look? 🚀"

Todays session is all about understanding the outside factors that will effect your business. We already talked about customers, but there is a lot more that goes into it!\n\n\n1\n\nConduct a market size evaluation to understand your business potential.\nLook at the competitive landscape to identify areas of opportunity.\nEvaluate some barriers to entry including financial barriers.\nSESSION OBJECTIVES\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nConduct a market size evaluation to understand your business potential.\nLook at the competitive landscape to identify areas of opportunity.\nEvaluate some barriers to entry including financial barriers.\n\n2\n\nUNDERSTAND YOUR MARKET\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nSo up to this point we have talked about user research. That is all about the people and potential customers you will have. But there is more to understanding your market than just the customers. \nDiscussion: What else should you consider as a part of your market? \nPotential answers could be:\nCustomers:\nNeeds, feelings, wants, frustrations, etc…\nMarket size\nUser research\nCompetitors\nWho is currently serving your customers?\nExisting products/services/alternatives to your product\nHow many competitors\nMacro environment. Any factors in a PESTEL analysis might come up, including:\nPolitical: How does the government intervene in the economy? \nYour countries government policy, priorities, and current initiatives\nTax, Trade, environment, labor laws, etc…\nPolitical stability/instability\nEconomic: What is the economic situation? \nHigh growth? Slow? (look at GDP growth)\nInflation?\nExchange rate\nConsumer spending and disposable income (i.e. Are people spending money right now)?\nConsider how market trends in energy efficiency and sustainability could impact business costs and consumer demand. Are rising energy prices or changing regulations creating new opportunities?\nSocial: Any cultural factors that would affect your business?\nSocial trends?\nLifestyle choices\nReligious beliefs\nConsumer tastes and buying habits\nTechnology: How will changing technologies affect your business?\nHow is community responding to tech changes\nHow is your business responding to growing tech\nDisruptive technology\nEnvironment:\nWeather/climate factors \nWhat are environmental laws and regulations required by businesses?\nCSR norms in your country/region of business\nDoes your business have a direct impact on the environment? \nClimate trends, energy/resource costs, and regulations impacting business operations.\nLegal: What are the legal factors related to your industry?\nHealth and safety standards\nGlobal trade laws\nConsumer rights and labor laws\nChanges in legislation\n Additional PESTEL Analysis Question: “How do sustainability trends create risks or opportunities in your market?”\nEtc…\n\nAsk: Why is it important to deeply understand all of these different market?\nThere are 2 primary reasons to do this: \nYou need to see if your business has a place in the market given the competition, economy, customer needs, etc…\nInvestors doing due diligence will want to see that you know the ins and outs of your business. You should show that your product/service has a large market and it is growing. You need to convince them that based on all of this research/information, you are a good bet.\nIf you consider all of these factors, you are likely to find big trends that will either help or hurt your business. It is very important to understand these points at the very beginning. So you can capitalize on them or avoid risks.\n\nRecap: As you are in these first stages of your business, make sure you evaluate these points. It is up to you to determine what is most important for you to research to ensure the success of your business. \n\n\n3\n\nMarket size\nCompetitive analysis\nBarriers to entry\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n1-2 minutes: Lecture\n\nThere is so much that goes into the research phase of starting a business. We can spend months or even years researching an idea! Although research is important, you don’t want to get sucked into only doing research and never making progress on your business. We want to learn some of the key points, and begin to start testing and building our products. Research is ongoing throughout the development of your business (rather than a long period at the start)\nWe will go over 3 market research elements today. If we talked about a point earlier that you think is important for your business, you should conduct that as well! You should look at the needs of your individual business and make a plan to research what you need. \n\n\nThe market analysis section of your feasibility study will cover these 4 points:\nMarket size: How big is the market you will be competing in? How many people are willing to pay for what you are offering? Market sizing should also consider long-term trends—such as consumer demand for sustainable products or shifts in energy costs.\nCompetitive analysis: Who is currently in this space? What are their strengths and weaknesses? \nBarriers to entry: What are the challenges you will face to enter into this market safely?\n\n4\n\nThis can capture larger trends as well\nGlobal, \nRegional,\nor\nNational\nMARKET SIZE\ni.e. If you are an eco-tourism app, talk about the entire tourism market.\n\n5 minutes: Discussion + Lecture\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\nMarket sizing is all about knowing the demand for a product or service within a particular geographical reach.\nA local evaluation is essential, but remember there is probably really valuable information on global or regional level as well (especially if you are looking to scale).\nYou may have heard about TAM, SAM, SOM as market sizing techniques. These are great, but can be complicated to understand. \nWe want to talk about the size of your market in a simpler way. Through storytelling.\nWhat is the story of your market/industry? \nHow do you KNOW that people want and need this and there is a really big opportunity here?\nIs this market big enough for you or an investor to get good returns? Are there sustainability-related trends that give your business an advantage?\nIs the market standing still, growing, or declining?\nIs sustainability influencing growth in your industry? If so, how?\n\n3 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: How can you actually gather this information?\nPotential answers: \nInternet\nBooks \nArticles\nStatistics office \nSurvey or user research data\nAny existing research or data \n\nRecap: We need a combination of primary and secondary research to get the information we need. You still need to go out and talk to people, but consider that there might be a lot of information already existing. There is a lot of information online, just look it up. You should have a clear picture of what the global and regional industry is looking like. There is so much research that has already been done for you. You can use the internet, go to government offices, read books and articles to find existing data. This is very valuable information as well, you just need to know where to look and what specifically to look for. Please keep in mind, everyone has very different business ideas and your personal research journey will be different from your peers. \n\n\n\n\nGlobal market value: US $1,340 Billion CAGR of +5%\n\nMiddle East captures about 4% of this market capturing US $68 Billion\n*Data from UNWTO Tourism Highlights, 2018\nTOTAL AVAILABLE MARKET\nGrowing at a rate of nearly 13%\nMiddle East\n4 minutes: Lecture\n\nGive an example on how you did research for your tourism business idea. \nI found this information about the tourism industry just through a simple Google search.\nTalk to them about the numbers in a way that is similar to how they would speak to an investor about them. \nThis is a huge market, $1.3 billion a year and it is growing\nThe Middle East is capturing 4 % of this, but what is really interesting is that the ME is growing at a higher rate than anywhere else in the world at nearly 13%. \nThere is a huge opportunity here, and we want to capture some of it!\n\nMiddle East captures about 4% of this market share and is growing at a rate of 5%\n\n*Data from UNWTO Tourism Highlights, 2018\nTOTAL AVAILABLE MARKET\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n4.9 world average\nEurope\nAsia and the Pacific\nAmericas\nAfrica\nMiddle East\n8.0\n2.6\n1.3\n8.0\n12.8\nInternational tourism receipts, \nchange by region, 2017 (real terms,%)\n1-2 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nExample (continued)\nYou can take a closer look at how this breakdown in a bit more detail here. The Middle East tourism is growing more than 2ce as fast as the world average. \n\n\nYOUR MARKET\n3 minutes: Lecture + Discussion\n\nExample (continued)\nLocal market\nNow lets take a look at the national level. This is more related to you and your actual capabilities.\nHow is tourism going where you are actually operating and can reach customers?\nI used another source here to add on to my previous points. This article is showing in numbers that there are actually a lot of people here, within my businesses geographical reach who can benefit from my business. Not just Dubai or Jordan, for example. \n\nAsk: What kind of story does all of this data tell (slides 6-8)? How does it make you feel about starting a business in the tourism industry?\nPotential answers:\nIt shows that people are actually traveling to this region and spending money\nPeople are spending a lot of money here\nThere is a growing interest year to year\nThis is really interesting data! It makes me want to get into this business now! \n\nRecap: Explain to them that they want to tell a good story. Use whatever you can to visually show your audience what a great idea your business is. Mostly everyone in the class will feel that a tourism business might be a good idea because we have shown with evidence the potential of the market from a reputable source. They should be this convincing with their business ideas.\n\n\n8\n\nMiddle East captures about 4% of this market share and is growing at a rate of 5%\n\nYOUR MARKET\n40 minutes: Brainstorm + activity\n\n15 minutes: Group example\nWhat can you capture?\nAs a last step, after you show that there is a good market, you need to show what you can actually capture in it. \nOut of the people who want/need your product or service, think about who you can actually capture and serve based on your business capabilities.\nThink about your actual capabilities. Although there are 1.3 million tourists traveling to Kurdistan, there is no way that I am reaching anywhere close to that number! People don’t know about my business and I don’t have the human or financial resources to meet all these customers needs. \nThink about what you plan to capture and how you plan to grow in 3 years time. \n\nGroup brainstorm on the board. Do an example together to build out how a tourism business might grow over time. Build the example from discussion from the class. Here is an example of what it might end up looking like:\nYear 1: Development year all about testing \n2-3 staff members based in ______ city.\nBuilding out my website and professionalizing my product, while exploring cost-effective, sustainable materials.\nI will only work with 5 tours a month at $200/tour as I am testing my services\nI am expecting about $12,000 in revenues in the first year\n\nYear 2: Expanding my reach and building a brand\nWill expand to another city and hire 2-3 more staff members\nStronger focus on advertising and building strategic partnerships, especially with organizations that support sustainability-driven businesses.\nPartnerships and advertising fees on my website will start to generate a small amount of revenues. \nI am aiming to grow monthly tours in _____ city to 10 tours a month at $200/tour\nI am aiming to work with 5 tours a month in new city at $200/ tour\nI am expecting about $36,000 in revenues in the second year\n\nYear 3: Expand my services and capabilities, including offering environmentally conscious options where relevant.\nI will reach more people in the cities I am operating in and expand my current offerings. \nNew hires will be made.\nI am expecting to grow the number of tours and advertisements to make $50,000 in the 3rd year\nI will offer weekend trips and sell merchandise as well. These revenue streams are intended to bring in another $20,000 in revenues.\nI am expecting $70,000 in revenues by the 3rd year.\n\n\n25 minutes: Activity\n20 minutes: Practice\nEntrepreneurs will have 15 minutes to practice this on their own.\nThey will have difficulties, so a trainer should be available to help walk them through their individual ideas.\n5 minutes: Recap and share\n1-2 entrepreneurs will share their results.\nAdditional questions will be answered if there are any.\n\nMarket size\nCompetitive analysis\nBarriers to entry\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n<1 minute: Lecture\n\nCompetitive analysis: Who is currently in this space? What are their strengths and weaknesses? \nWe do this to learn more about current solutions to your customers problems and to identify opportunities for your business to fill gaps.\n\n10\n\nCompetitive rivalry:\nCOMPETITIVE RIVALRY:\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: Does anyone think that they don’t have competitors?\nMost of the group will admit that they have competitors, but you might get 1-2 people saying that they don’t have any competitors\nThe truth is, everyone has competitors one way or another. They aren’t always doing exactly what you are doing, but there are other ways that your customers can be spending their time and money instead of using you. There are other solutions to their problems right now, even though they might not be as good as your solution. \n\nBrainstorm direct competition for a tourism app/agency. \nTourism app example:\nDirect competitors: Applications that offer tourism advice available in Sulaimani. Trip Advisor can be considered a direct competitor. It is a website that offers tourism advice to people visiting places all around the world, including Sulaimani. \nIndirect competitors: Concierge services at hotels provide a similar service. Other options for tourists include personal research on Google\nA substitute product uses a different option to try to solve the same economic need. So maybe the reason someone goes on vacation is to relax. Instead of spending money on a trip, maybe they choose to stay home and relax for a week. Or maybe they go to the spa down the street from them instead.\n\nCOMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING\nFactor\nMy Business\nCompetitor A\nCompetitor B\nCompetitor C\nOpportunities Identified\n7 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nCompetitor benchmarking is a tool for you to evaluate how your competitors are serving your customers on a variety of factors that your customers care about. You are doing this to learn about where you can add or match value for your product. It is highly unlikely that your idea is entirely original. So it is essential to evaluate the competitive landscape. This helps establish how crowded the market is, how you can improve upon the competition’s offering and if there are gaps in the market to be exploited. \n\nPractice competitive benchmarking tool on the board:\nSTEP 1: Identify competitors that already exist (they must benchmark at least 3 competitors).\nWrite on the board: Trip advisor, google, local tour agency, whichever ones you choose\nMake sure to compare it to at least 1 international competitor. This can be useful to find best practices or new ideas.\n\nSTEP 2: Record features, pros, cons, areas of improvement, successes of each of your identified competitors\nList out the features together\nAsk: What are the things tourists care most about that you would want to compare yourself to?\nProducts offered\nSell on credit?\nSales channels\nBrand image \nPrice\nQuality\nService\nReliability\nLocation\nSecurity\nMake sure to think about what is important to your specific business and customers. Consider factors that came up during user interviews.\n\nSTEP 3: Identify opportunities or requirements for your business.\nFor example, is everyone offering discounts? You might need to as well if your customers expect it.\nAre all local tourism agencies operating only in person? There could be an opportunity to differentiate yourself by having a strong online presence.\n\n\nFactors\nMy Business\nCompetitor A\nCompetitor B\nCompetitor C\nProducts\n \n \n \n \nPrice\n \n \n \n \nService\n \n \n \n \nLocation\n \n \n \n \nSales method\n \n \n \n \nOperational Efficiency\nIdentify:\n\nStrongest competitors\nMost important features\nAreas that make you different\nPoints of innovation\n\nCOMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING\n2-3 minutes: Lecture\n\nCompetitive benchmarking is a great way to pinpoint gaps in the market, identify new opportunities, and find ways to differentiate yourself from your competitors. \nTo do this:\nYou can look online for similar businesses around the world, but you should also experience the local competitors. \nObserve them, try to buy something, download the app, whatever it is. \nYou should learn as much as you can about what your competitors are doing well and what they aren't doing well. \n\nMarket size\nCompetitive analysis\nBarriers to entry\n\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n<1 minute: Lecture\n\nBarriers to entry: What are the challenges you will face to enter into this market safely?\nWhat do you need financially to enter the market? Are there industry trends, technologies, or operational efficiencies that could help reduce costs or improve long-term financial sustainability?\n\n14\n\nEvaluate barriers to entry:\nKnowledge, skills & tech barriers\nFinancial barriers\nLegal barriers​\nIS YOUR BUSINESS FEASIBLE? \n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nFinally, the last thing we will talk about today are barriers to entry.\nAsk: Does anyone know what this means? Who has an example?\nHave a discussion about general barriers to entry\nPotential answers:\nSkills needed\nFinancial/capital,\nNetwork, \nLegal approvals (zoning, IP, etc), \nSpecific industry knowledge needed, \nR&D \n\nRecap: Now go into the three shown on the slide (knowledge, skills, and tech/legal/financial). Tie it into the points they brought up during the discussion.\nKnowledge, skills, and tech barriers: Are you technically able to make this? Do you have the right skills and know-how? If not, how do you plan to get around this barrier?\nLegal barriers: Make sure to include a legal analysis. You should start to do research on the legal side of your business. What are some of the barriers you foresee to launch your business from the legal perspective? Each entrepreneur will need to spend time in different ministries based on their businesses. \nTrainers can share Roadmap2Startup or other legal resources\nTrainers can also bring in a lawyer for CEO Talk\nFinancial barriers: Finally, what are the financial barriers to launch? This is a barrier that can have a huge impact on your ability to start. It is the amount of money you need to open the business and keep it running before you become profitable. Businesses spend money before they open their doors. That is what we will focus on right now.\n\nThings to consider:\nDevelopment costs\nInitial marketing\nInitial working capital\nLegal fees\nMaterials and supplies\n\nBUILDING A BUDGET:\n0\n1,000,000\n2,000,000\n3,000,000\n4,000,000\n5,000,000\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nWe will focus on the financial feasibility of your business right now. We are doing this as a key step to learn if your business is realistic to start based on the resources you have and the resources that you would need to start. Start up expenses are those expenses incurred before your business is running, but contribute to the long term success of it. In order to evaluate what you will need to start, you should create a start up budget.\nAsk: What are the different things that you need to include in your start up budget include?\nPotential answers:\nDevelopment costs: What you need to actually create and develop your product. This will really depend on what you are making. I listed some examples below, but it can be much more detailed than this.\nApp development\nWebsite development\nDomain and Hosting for 1 year\nInitial research and development\nLogo designer \nOffice, store, center, land rent for 6 months to a year (depending on how long you think it will take before you are profitable) \nFurniture/decoration\nConstruction/repairs/paint\nWebsite\nLogo design\nMachinery or tools\nInitial marketing:\nGrand opening event\nSocial media advertisements (when doing the budget, be specific on which platforms you will use and how much you will spend on each)\nFlyers, brochures, marketing material\nSignage \nInitial working capital: Any additional money you will needed to operate your business for the first 6 months to a year while you are still working to become profitable\nSalaries for the first few months\nOperational needs\nLegal fees:\nRegistration\nLawyer fees\nName registration\nIntellectual property and patents\nMaterials and supplies: \nThe first set of items that you need to sell\nMaterials needed to make the final product\nCleaning supplies\nPaper goods\nConsumables\n\nItem\nPrice\nQuantity\nTotal price\nPersonal contribution\nNotes\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\n\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\u000b\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\u000b\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\u000b\n\u000b\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\u000b\nTotal costs:\n$-\nPersonal contribution:\n$-\nTotal still needed\n$-\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\n\nThis is the start up budget found in your feasibility study. You all need to complete one. We want to see how feasible your project idea is on the financial side. How much do you need to get started, and how much are you contributing to this? We want to see that you have skin in the game as well, so don’t forget to count your contribution of time, energy, materials, etc… \nGo through each of the columns and make sure the group is clear about what each one means:\nItem: What is the name of the thing you will buy\nPrice: How much is it for 1 of these things\nQuantity: How many do you need?\nTotal price: Price x quantity. \nPersonal contribution: How much of this item are you contributing? Will you pay for the whole thing? A part of it? None of it?\nNotes: Please put any notes about the item here. Explain if it is something not straightforward, or if the price is a bit higher or lower than expected. Are you getting it from somewhere unusual? Any notes about the item here.\n\nAsk entrepreneurs how they would fill in the information for a tourism business before moving on to the next slide. Go over 2-3 lines just to make sure they understand it. \n\n\nItem\nPrice\nQuantity\nTotal price\nPersonal contribution\nNotes\n\u000bApp development\n$ 15,000\n1\n$ 15,000\n$-\nI will use a company in India  who will make both Android and IOS versions. This is the best option because of their reasonable price and high quality work.\nFacebook advertisements\n$ 20\n12\n$ 240\n$-\nI will use Facebook to spread the word about my business. I will sponsor a post once a week for 3 months.\nLabor\n$ 500\n6\n$ 3,000\n$ 3,000\nI need to pay for sales representatives for 6 months before the business is profitable\nComputer\u000b\n$ 800\n1\n$ 800\n$ 800\nI will donate my personal Lenovo computer to my business (new condition)\n\u000b\n\u000b\nYOUR START-UP COSTS\n   Total Costs:\n$ 19,040\n   Personal Contribution:\n$ 3,800\n   Total still needed:\n$ 15,240\n\nYOUR START-UP COSTS\n5 minutes: Lecture + example\n\nGo over example:\nThis is a really basic example. The start up costs should be much more detailed and cover all the points we mentioned earlier. Make sure to clearly explain the box about personal contribution. \n\nHow do you start?\nA good place to start is to just brainstorm and flush out everything you think you need.\nMonetize everything. If you are working 10 hours a day on your project, what is that worth?\nThen visit your competitors and see what they have or are using. Try to figure out if you are missing any major costs. \nThere is also a lot of information on the internet, just Google “what do I need to start a ____ business” and results will come up. Be aware that it will probably be somewhat accurate in terms of WHAT you need, but the price will likely vary from what is already online. You need to look at the local context of the business.\n\nTo understand the pricing, you should check 2-3 price options and write which one you think would be the best.\n18\n\nPRACTICE\n25 minutes: Activity\n\n15 minutes: Activity\nBreak the class up into groups\nThink through the start up costs for an example business (tourism business).\nEntrepreneurs can be creative on the type of tourism business it is (application, agency, etc…)\n\n10 minutes: Share\nWhen the group comes back, have a few groups share.\nLook for these things to give feedback on:\nWhose costs are extremely high? Why were they so high? Are they buying the most expensive options? Do they have unnecessary costs? It is good to have the ideal situation in mind, but you should consider in a very realistic way, how they can start their business for a reasonable amount. \nDoes anyone have an extremely low budget? Think about key things that they aren’t including. Are they paying for transportation, labor, technology development, etc…\nIs there anything major that was left out?\n\nRecap: Everyone should create a start up budget for their business, or a new project within their business. You need to know if you can actually do this financially! This is important so that you can think through the feasibility of the idea and also set the best plan to implement. Keep in mind that this budget can change for a variety of reasons. \nConsider who this budget is for. You? An investor? A donor? The budget might change based on why you are creating it and who it is for.\nAre you pitching to someone else? How much are they willing/able to contribute? There are pitch competitions for $1M $500k or $15k and everything in between. Know your audience and adjust your budget accordingly. \n\n\n\nCompetitive benchmarking \nStart-up budget\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up!\n\nTHANK YOU!\nAny Questions?\n21\n"

That is all about the people and potential customers you will have. But there is more to understanding your market than just the customers. \n* **Discussion: What else should you consider as a part of your market? **\n   * **Potential answers could be:**\n      * **Customers:**\n         * **Needs, feelings, wants, frustrations, etc…**\n         * **Market size**\n         * **User research**\n      * **Competitors**\n         * **Who is currently serving your customers?**\n         * **Existing products/services/alternatives to your product**\n         * **How many competitors**\n      * **Macro environment. Any factors in a PESTEL analysis might come up, including:**\n         * **Political: How does the government intervene in the economy? **\n            * **Your countries government policy, priorities, and current initiatives**\n            * **Tax, Trade, environment, labor laws, etc…**\n            * **Political stability/instability**\n         * **Economic: What is the economic situation? **\n            * **High growth? Slow? (look at GDP growth)**\n            * **Inflation?**\n            * **Exchange rate**\n            * **Consumer spending and disposable income (i.e. Are people spending money right now)?**\n            * **Consider how market trends in energy efficiency and sustainability could impact business costs and consumer demand. Are rising energy prices or changing regulations creating new opportunities?**\n         * **Social: Any cultural factors that would affect your business?**\n            * **Social trends?**\n            * **Lifestyle choices**\n            * **Religious beliefs**\n            * **Consumer tastes and buying habits**\n         * **Technology: How will changing technologies affect your business?**\n            * **How is community responding to tech changes**\n            * **How is your business responding to growing tech**\n            * **Disruptive technology**\n         * **Environment:**\n            * **Weather/climate factors **\n            * **Does your business have a direct impact on the environment? **\n            * **Climate trends, energy/resource costs, and regulations impacting business operations.**\n         * **Legal: What are the legal factors related to your industry?**\n            * **Health and safety standards**\n            * **Global trade laws**\n            * **Consumer rights and labor laws**\n            * **Changes in legislation**\n            * ** Additional PESTEL Analysis Question: “How do sustainability trends create risks or opportunities in your market?”**\n      * **Etc…**\n* **Ask: Why is it important to deeply understand all of these different market?**\n   * **There are 2 primary reasons to do this: **\n1. You need to see if your business has a place in the market given the competition, economy, customer needs, etc…\n2. Investors doing due diligence will want to see that you know the ins and outs of your business. You should show that your product/service has a large market and it is growing. You need to convince them that based on all of this research/information, you are a good bet.\n3. If you consider all of these factors, you are likely to find big trends that will either help or hurt your business. It is very important to understand these points at the very beginning. So you can capitalize on them or avoid risks.\n* **Recap: As you are in these first stages of your business, make sure you evaluate these points. It is up to you to determine what is most important for you to research to ensure the success of your business. \"\"\"**",

But there is more to understanding your market than just the customers. \n* **Discussion: What else should you consider as a part of your market? **\n   * **Potential answers could be:**\n      * **Customers:**\n         * **Needs, feelings, wants, frustrations, etc…**\n         * **Market size**\n         * **User research**\n      * **Competitors**\n         * **Who is currently serving your customers?**\n         * **Existing products/services/alternatives to your product**\n         * **How many competitors**\n      * **Macro environment. Any factors in a PESTEL analysis might come up, including:**\n         * **Political: How does the government intervene in the economy? **\n            * **Your countries government policy, priorities, and current initiatives**\n            * **Tax, Trade, environment, labor laws, etc…**\n            * **Political stability/instability**\n         * **Economic: What is the economic situation? **\n            * **High growth? Slow? (look at GDP growth)**\n            * **Inflation?**\n            * **Exchange rate**\n            * **Consumer spending and disposable income (i.e. Are people spending money right now)?**\n            * **Consider how market trends in energy efficiency and sustainability could impact business costs and consumer demand. Are rising energy prices or changing regulations creating new opportunities?**\n         * **Social: Any cultural factors that would affect your business?**\n            * **Social trends?**\n            * **Lifestyle choices**\n            * **Religious beliefs**\n            * **Consumer tastes and buying habits**\n         * **Technology: How will changing technologies affect your business?**\n            * **How is community responding to tech changes**\n            * **How is your business responding to growing tech**\n            * **Disruptive technology**\n         * **Environment:**\n            * **Weather/climate factors **\n            * **Does your business have a direct impact on the environment? **\n            * **Climate trends, energy/resource costs, and regulations impacting business operations.**\n         * **Legal: What are the legal factors related to your industry?**\n            * **Health and safety standards**\n            * **Global trade laws**\n            * **Consumer rights and labor laws**\n            * **Changes in legislation**\n            * ** Additional PESTEL Analysis Question: “How do sustainability trends create risks or opportunities in your market?”**\n      * **Etc…**\n* **Ask: Why is it important to deeply understand all of these different market?**\n   * **There are 2 primary reasons to do this: **\n1. You need to see if your business has a place in the market given the competition, economy, customer needs, etc…\n2. Investors doing due diligence will want to see that you know the ins and outs of your business. You should show that your product/service has a large market and it is growing. You need to convince them that based on all of this research/information, you are a good bet.\n3. If you consider all of these factors, you are likely to find big trends that will either help or hurt your business. It is very important to understand these points at the very beginning. So you can capitalize on them or avoid risks.\n* **Recap: As you are in these first stages of your business, make sure you evaluate these points. It is up to you to determine what is most important for you to research to ensure the success of your business. \"\"\"**",
