      "content": "Can you give me a summary, a list of principles, and organize the ideas better and give me an outline?\n\nHello everybody and welcome to AI for Growth. It's a workshop that's running from July 14 to the 16th run by the Bloom Community Workshops crew.\n\n00:10\n\nI'm Bilal, I'm your host today and I'm gonna go over what we did today on Friday and essentially we went over the main theme of how to use AI for positive impact and I'm gonna give you a little bit of information at the end about how to prepare for tomorrow.\n\n00:28\n\nSo what will we learn today? What we're gonna do is we're gonna go over the basic operations of AI and how it works and we're gonna understand what word vectors and clustering imply for using AI and then we're gonna go over some principles that can help us think about how can we use these new tools\n\n00:45\n\nto support us with our work and at the end we're gonna talk about AI mitigation risk mitigation and how to use AI responsibly.\n\n00:54\n\nAnd when I'm talking about AI I'm fundamentally talking about the large language models and the generative AI that is becoming.\n\n01:02\n\nSo we're not doing the principles for engaging sessions since we're asynchronous right now, but I wanted to talk about this first moment.\n\n01:12\n\nI'm curious if you remember when you were first surprised by an artificial intelligent tool. So for me, it was when I asked Chad GPT to identify a new letter from one of my favorite authors, Seneca, a Roman philosopher, about the benefits of eating with your hands versus eating with a knife and fork\n\n01:39\n\n. And it wrote it and I, It was amazed. I really thought that it could have quite possibly been an undiscovered letter from this philosopher.\n\n01:50\n\nAnd I'm wondering if you want to pause for a second and think for yourself, when was the first time you realized that this is different?\n\n01:56\n\nAI is now a really interesting tool to explore. Okay, why am I doing this? So I want to make sure that AI gets into good hands yours.\n\n02:09\n\nAnd that is for people that are working in social impact and nonprofits. I know that there are other organizations that have large budgets for R and D.\n\n02:18\n\nI believe that this tool should be democratized. Especially since I believe the the impact space is going to be the space that can really show how to be using AI tools responsibly.\n\n02:31\n\nAnd in order to do that, we're going to do it together as a community. Okay. So today is the overview.\n\n02:41\n\nWe're going to go over AI, basically how to use it. Some interesting things about prompts and we'll give you your assignment for day two, which is to come up with a list of tasks that you do on a day to day.\n\n02:53\n\nHow long it takes you. And we're going to try to work to see which of those tasks we can improve or do.\n\n03:02\n\nBetter or faster with some of these AI tools. And then on day three, we're going to continue that process and at the end, we'll be exploring some new ones.\n\n03:11\n\nWe're going to be doing this in a case clinic kind of community oriented way where I will be providing some of my insights, but I believe that there are more insights.\n\n03:21\n\nIt's to be gained from the community and also just some time and space to explore some tools together, including some of the resources that I've gathered for this workshop.\n\n03:30\n\nAnd after the sessions are over, we can continue learning and connecting on the community page. So what makes generative AI and these LLMs different than traditional machine.\n\n03:41\n\nLearning and why is that important? So traditional machine learning has a important difference, which is oftentimes. There are features, for instance, there are expert systems where you define each fork does the person have a bruise?\n\n03:59\n\nYes, then follow this train. Does the person have a bruise? Yes. The person not have a bruise, then follow this train, and this is how some of the online medical websites work.\n\n04:12\n\nAnd you can always follow the path and say, okay, so the machine gave you this response because it followed this tree that was derived from an expert, and so it's observable.\n\n04:19\n\nYou actually know why and how it worked. But in, the deep learning process, we actually have no clue. All we know is that it gives us a result.\n\n04:28\n\nWhether it's a good result, a bad result, or why, we're not really sure. And the way that the large language models work, it's by proximity.\n\n04:38\n\nSo it goes and it identifies the distance between each one, word and all other words around it. And it does it for thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of documents.\n\n04:50\n\nAnd then it can tell you probabilistically, if you say, I, it's very likely to say the word am afterwards. Just because in the millions of times before, this is about how, often it happened.\n\n05:03\n\nSo that means it doesn't really understand grammar it understands probabilities. And so this actually forms these, these clustering and these vectors.\n\n05:17\n\nAnd it's kind of interesting to go explore it because you can see in this set of, clusters, there's motivation along with exceptional and organizational necessity.\n\n05:29\n\nBut also once you go a little bit further out, you can find things that don't seem to be so connected secrets, for instance.\n\n05:37\n\nAnd then this kind of cluster, app is, I think, really nice to be able to see because it will help us think about how these tools help us with analogies, for instance.\n\n05:51\n\nOh, I saw investor and generous, which is kind of interesting, eh, over here in the red section. Okay, let's get back to our presentation.\n\n05:59\n\nAlright, so, What do you think king minus man plus woman equals? You can pause for a second to think. It's queen.\n\n06:13\n\nWhy do you think that is? Or Cider minus apples plus grape? It's wine. So this is what it would be like if, the AI was observable.\n\n06:25\n\nSo you can see a horse doesn't have authority, but it does have a tail. But a king doesn't have a tail and has 100% authority.\n\n06:34\n\nAnd this is how we can do this sort of mathematics with numbers and come up with the, at the analogies.\n\n06:45\n\nThe challenge is when we do it across the entire internet up until 2021, what we see is this. And this number right over here, negative.034189.\n\n06:59\n\nWe don't know if that says that a king, is not from Africa, for instance, or that a ruler is not a woman or a CEO is not a woman.\n\n07:12\n\nLike, we don't know how to interpret these numbers because it's just the probabilities and we don't know what the features are.\n\n07:21\n\nAnd this is, the embeddings based on Wikipedia, and it's even larger for things like chat TPT. So what? Well, these embeddings, you can imagine them putting a word in space, sort of like x, y, z, but you have many more dimensions.\n\n07:37\n\nAnd then the very, very interesting thing, and the science that's emerging that I think is really surprising, and I would love to share, is that when you do that across all languages, you find they overlap.\n\n07:50\n\nAnd that means that we're also potentially able to understand the language of animals. And that saying something is stored in those vectors that's really deep about, communication.\n\n08:05\n\nOkay, so what does this imply? It means that chat TPT is not thinking, you're not talking to a conscious entity.\n\n08:13\n\nIt is simply autocomplete. And it's trained on vectors that encompass the entire internet up until September 2021. And that means it doesn't know everything.\n\n08:33\n\nIt's autocomplete and the implications are that GPT doesn't think for itself. It makes it great for finding analogies and synergies because you can think about, the clustering technique and the information is incomplete.\n\n08:48\n\nIt's actually cut off at 2021 and this is another surprising thing. It's really not good at math because it's not thinking.\n\n08:54\n\nIt's not calculating. It's finding proximity. And also this means that by, S is baked in and we need to find ways of undoing that.\n\n09:08\n\nI'm finding so how can we correct some of these challenges? We need to use our own brains to think. We need to add context into the prompt.\n\n09:20\n\nSo it has additional information. We need to potentially, be aware of and correct biases. And one really cool tip is ask it to think out loud.\n\n09:30\n\nSay show your work step by step. And this is how we can actually use the human in the loop to monitor its process and try to understand what it's doing.\n\n09:41\n\nOkay. So principle zero the basics of prompting. Is to give it a context, a task, an instruction to have it clarify.\n\n09:51\n\nSo you can ask it, do you understand? Ask me any clarifying questions you might need. And then it will be able to be refined.\n\n10:00\n\nSo you can pause it for a second to read this kind of example prompt. This is kind of. Just basic best best practices and we'll get into some principles that I have found very helpful.\n\n10:12\n\nSo finding analogies and clustering information is a great way to use this tool. So basically, you can find an idea that you have near.\n\n10:35\n\nYou can find the relationships between anything. So I asked just recently who would be toven's best friend be in modern times and given their.\n\n10:44\n\nPersonality types and they gave me Bjork, which I GPT was like Bjork definitely. You can also identify participants in your programs that might need similar support if you can get the data into the context window.\n\n10:59\n\nSo for example what I did was I took a really long and messy notes. And I asked it to extract all the products from the notes doc and to create a table of the projects that they want to do in the future cluster the projects that are similar and add a column for the tables that mentioned similar\n\n11:17\n\nprojects. This was a way to be able to take the people in a room and to identify all the conversations across all the tables.\n\n11:25\n\nSo I had seven different tables worth of documents and it was able to do it. And you can see over here, this is the initiative this is the main objective and even gave some implementation steps, potential challenges.\n\n11:40\n\nAnd then the reference are the tables. So for instance, tables 1a 1a, 3, 2, and 5, they're all working on developing a curriculum and that means that we can cluster the people there to work on that project.\n\n11:55\n\nTake on personas. This is a really cool principle to think about. GPT can take on personas and be anyone you needed to be.\n\n12:02\n\nWhat are the implications? You can ask it. To talk like a professional designer and it will talk like a professional designer with all of the knowledge that it has found online.\n\n12:13\n\nSo you can ask it to work with you to design a logo and ask you questions that a you can tell it.\n\n12:21\n\nYou are a professional designer. I'm wanting to design a logo. Ask me the. Questions you need to gather the information to design the best logo and then summarize the content.\n\n12:31\n\nAnd if you do that, what will happen is it will know the best practices up until it's cut off date and ask you questions that a designer would more than likely ask you and then be able to give you the the information that.\n\n12:45\n\nYou could then send to a designer and kind of preempt all of that work and potentially speed up the process.\n\n12:51\n\nIt can also act like Socrates and help you discover your innate knowledge. So I have this example coming up. You don't need to feel like you're working alone.\n\n12:58\n\nYou can always tell JPG what you're up to and get moving again. So this is something that I find whenever I'm stuck and it's kind of just talk to it.\n\n13:06\n\nAnd I find it helps me feel like I have a, a colleague. So this is an example, if you'd like to pause the screen about asking it to think like Socrates and help me realize that I have some innate knowledge about something.\n\n13:21\n\nAnd so I gave it this example and it guided me through to understand how GPT three works. Okay. Third principle.\n\n13:34\n\nUse examples in context and encourage your AI. So you need to be able to give it context for all of the things that it doesn't know.\n\n13:44\n\nAnd one of the really surprising things is that you can actually tell JAP, chat GPT, it's able to do things and that increases its ability.\n\n13:52\n\nSo apparently it has low self esteem and low confidence. You can also need to bring information back into the context window by bringing the information and just pasting it.\n\n14:06\n\nAgain, because the windows can be quite short and after some time talking back and forth with the agent, you might need to kind of update it with the information you need.\n\n14:16\n\nThat's just some important things to know. So here's an example. So I asked it to make me a logo using mid journey and you can see all this content.\n\n14:26\n\nOver here, you can consume this content in video form on my youtube channel, the dot. I copied and pasted an entire website and I just put it in as context and I said, this person wrote up a great blog post on how to use mid journey for logo generation.\n\n14:39\n\nAnd over here, it gives me the results. So it says here's a few prompts incorporating different styles and referencing. Famous designers and it gave me these different responses.\n\n14:52\n\nAnd here's the post that I found that was really funny. Telling chat GPT for it was more competent increased the success rate from 35 to 90 to present.\n\n15:01\n\nAnd then giving it a strategy for completing the task increased it from 26 to 54. So just because it has access to the entire internet, don't think it knows what to do.\n\n15:09\n\nTell it what to do. Be explicit. Be confidence. Say you can do it and you'll be getting better results. Okay.\n\n15:17\n\nSo what is our homework for tomorrow? Please make a list of all the tasks that you do in a week or month and how you conventionally complete those tasks and what are the tasks?\n\n15:26\n\nYou think AI might be able to help you with. I'm going to show you the sheet I made that we're going to use for the next couple of days.\n\n15:34\n\nOkay. So over here, we can put our names over here. We can put our task that we work on. For instance, I was talking with some people and they were working on content generation.\n\n15:47\n\nFor on canvas and you can write how long it generally takes you. You can write about how you do it today.\n\n15:56\n\nAnd then we're going to work on on this part. So we're going to we're going to add our names. We're going to add our tasks and then we're going to spend time.\n\n16:05\n\nGoing over the. The various prompting techniques that I just shared and explained. And work together at coming up with approaches to resolve.\n\n16:18\n\nThe challenges that you're facing with your tasks and then we're going to put the links and references there. And then of course at the end.\n\n16:27\n\nFor the day, we're going to go over the potential ethical concerns that we have. And that's it. I'll share this.\n\n16:34\n\nI made it publicly editable so that anyone can edit and please add a couple of tasks and we'll do this either in the beginning of the workshop as well.\n\n16:47\n\nWe. We'll go over some more examples from my my, my history and potential tools that we've been gathering inside of the the AI resources website.\n\n17:06\n\nSo if you haven't seen. Yet we have this AI resources website where we are collecting various tools that we're using and approaches and we will be updating this website with the approaches that we're coming up with for each other here.\n\n17:24\n\nOkay. I hope that makes sense. And before we go, I wanted to share a bit about the elements of ethics and justice.\n\n17:38\n\nSo there's this beautiful quote that says the moral article the universe is long, but it bends towards justice. But what we're seeing is this idea.\n\n17:47\n\nYeah, of a potential local maximum. So we're going up towards justice, but somehow we're freezing. Our collective development ideas in 2021, because we've built that into our machines and.\n\n18:07\n\nIt seems like more and more of the content that's going to be released is digesting that information and that way of thinking.\n\n18:17\n\nAnd so let's say that the moral arc is curved up to here. We might get stuck here if we don't continue to use our brains and our hearts to.\n\n18:28\n\nTo write from the heart and to share from the heart and to talk about a better world and hopefully as the machines are learning again from our shares we can actually get to another another local maxima.\n\n18:46\n\nThis is not the end. So why should we be careful? Well, look at what Facebook's primary goal was always explicitly stated to bring people closer together.\n\n18:58\n\nThis is their website. It's still up today. And I think I think we've all felt that. It hasn't really lived up to that necessarily 100% and maybe even has been damaging relationships and creating bubbles.\n\n19:16\n\nAnd if you're curious to learn more about the potential dilemma and the challenges around AI feel free. You can check out this video link.\n\n19:24\n\nI'll share this entire slide d\\*\\*\\* with you or you can search the AI dilemma on YouTube for some some challenging information to digest.\n\n19:36\n\nAnd this is one of the reasons why I want to bring AI to the impact space, because I really believe that there's a way that we can show leadership about how to use some of these tools ethically and appropriately.\n\n19:48\n\nAnd I'll see you guys tomorrow.",

Just basic best best practices and we'll get into some principles that I have found very helpful.\n\n10:12\n\nSo finding analogies and clustering information is a great way to use this tool. So basically, you can find an idea that you have near.\n\n10:35\n\nYou can find the relationships between anything. So I asked just recently who would be toven's best friend be in modern times and given their.\n\n10:44\n\nPersonality types and they gave me Bjork, which I GPT was like Bjork definitely. You can also identify participants in your programs that might need similar support if you can get the data into the context window.\n\n10:59\n\nSo for example what I did was I took a really long and messy notes. And I asked it to extract all the products from the notes doc and to create a table of the projects that they want to do in the future cluster the projects that are similar and add a column for the tables that mentioned similar\n\n11:17\n\nprojects. This was a way to be able to take the people in a room and to identify all the conversations across all the tables.\n\n11:25\n\nSo I had seven different tables worth of documents and it was able to do it. And you can see over here, this is the initiative this is the main objective and even gave some implementation steps, potential challenges.\n\n11:40\n\nAnd then the reference are the tables. So for instance, tables 1a 1a, 3, 2, and 5, they're all working on developing a curriculum and that means that we can cluster the people there to work on that project.\n\n11:55\n\nTake on personas. This is a really cool principle to think about. GPT can take on personas and be anyone you needed to be.\n\n12:02\n\nWhat are the implications? You can ask it. To talk like a professional designer and it will talk like a professional designer with all of the knowledge that it has found online.\n\n12:13\n\nSo you can ask it to work with you to design a logo and ask you questions that a you can tell it.\n\n12:21\n\nYou are a professional designer. I'm wanting to design a logo. Ask me the. Questions you need to gather the information to design the best logo and then summarize the content.\n\n12:31\n\nAnd if you do that, what will happen is it will know the best practices up until it's cut off date and ask you questions that a designer would more than likely ask you and then be able to give you the the information that.\n\n12:45\n\nYou could then send to a designer and kind of preempt all of that work and potentially speed up the process.\n\n12:51\n\nIt can also act like Socrates and help you discover your innate knowledge. So I have this example coming up. You don't need to feel like you're working alone.\n\n12:58\n\nYou can always tell JPG what you're up to and get moving again. So this is something that I find whenever I'm stuck and it's kind of just talk to it.\n\n13:06\n\nAnd I find it helps me feel like I have a, a colleague. So this is an example, if you'd like to pause the screen about asking it to think like Socrates and help me realize that I have some innate knowledge about something.\n\n13:21\n\nAnd so I gave it this example and it guided me through to understand how GPT three works. Okay. Third principle.\n\n13:34\n\nUse examples in context and encourage your AI. So you need to be able to give it context for all of the things that it doesn't know.\n\n13:44\n\nAnd one of the really surprising things is that you can actually tell JAP, chat GPT, it's able to do things and that increases its ability.\n\n13:52\n\nSo apparently it has low self esteem and low confidence. You can also need to bring information back into the context window by bringing the information and just pasting it.\n\n14:06\n\nAgain, because the windows can be quite short and after some time talking back and forth with the agent, you might need to kind of update it with the information you need.\n\n14:16\n\nThat's just some important things to know. So here's an example. So I asked it to make me a logo using mid journey and you can see all this content.\n\n14:26\n\nOver here, you can consume this content in video form on my youtube channel, the dot. I copied and pasted an entire website and I just put it in as context and I said, this person wrote up a great blog post on how to use mid journey for logo generation.\n\n14:39\n\nAnd over here, it gives me the results. So it says here's a few prompts incorporating different styles and referencing. Famous designers and it gave me these different responses.\n\n14:52\n\nAnd here's the post that I found that was really funny. Telling chat GPT for it was more competent increased the success rate from 35 to 90 to present.\n\n15:01\n\nAnd then giving it a strategy for completing the task increased it from 26 to 54. So just because it has access to the entire internet, don't think it knows what to do.\n\n15:09\n\nTell it what to do. Be explicit. Be confidence. Say you can do it and you'll be getting better results. Okay.\n\n15:17\n\nSo what is our homework for tomorrow? Please make a list of all the tasks that you do in a week or month and how you conventionally complete those tasks and what are the tasks?\n\n15:26\n\nYou think AI might be able to help you with. I'm going to show you the sheet I made that we're going to use for the next couple of days.\n\n15:34\n\nOkay. So over here, we can put our names over here. We can put our task that we work on. For instance, I was talking with some people and they were working on content generation.\n\n15:47\n\nFor on canvas and you can write how long it generally takes you. You can write about how you do it today.\n\n15:56\n\nAnd then we're going to work on on this part. So we're going to we're going to add our names. We're going to add our tasks and then we're going to spend time.\n\n16:05\n\nGoing over the. The various prompting techniques that I just shared and explained. And work together at coming up with approaches to resolve.\n\n16:18\n\nThe challenges that you're facing with your tasks and then we're going to put the links and references there. And then of course at the end.\n\n16:27\n\nFor the day, we're going to go over the potential ethical concerns that we have. And that's it. I'll share this.\n\n16:34\n\nI made it publicly editable so that anyone can edit and please add a couple of tasks and we'll do this either in the beginning of the workshop as well.\n\n16:47\n\nWe. We'll go over some more examples from my my, my history and potential tools that we've been gathering inside of the the AI resources website.\n\n17:06\n\nSo if you haven't seen. Yet we have this AI resources website where we are collecting various tools that we're using and approaches and we will be updating this website with the approaches that we're coming up with for each other here.\n\n17:24\n\nOkay. I hope that makes sense. And before we go, I wanted to share a bit about the elements of ethics and justice.\n\n17:38\n\nSo there's this beautiful quote that says the moral article the universe is long, but it bends towards justice. But what we're seeing is this idea.\n\n17:47\n\nYeah, of a potential local maximum. So we're going up towards justice, but somehow we're freezing. Our collective development ideas in 2021, because we've built that into our machines and.\n\n18:07\n\nIt seems like more and more of the content that's going to be released is digesting that information and that way of thinking.\n\n18:17\n\nAnd so let's say that the moral arc is curved up to here. We might get stuck here if we don't continue to use our brains and our hearts to.\n\n18:28\n\nTo write from the heart and to share from the heart and to talk about a better world and hopefully as the machines are learning again from our shares we can actually get to another another local maxima.\n\n18:46\n\nThis is not the end. So why should we be careful? Well, look at what Facebook's primary goal was always explicitly stated to bring people closer together.\n\n18:58\n\nThis is their website. It's still up today. And I think I think we've all felt that. It hasn't really lived up to that necessarily 100% and maybe even has been damaging relationships and creating bubbles.\n\n19:16\n\nAnd if you're curious to learn more about the potential dilemma and the challenges around AI feel free. You can check out this video link.\n\n19:24\n\nI'll share this entire slide d\\*\\*\\* with you or you can search the AI dilemma on YouTube for some some challenging information to digest.\n\n19:36\n\nAnd this is one of the reasons why I want to bring AI to the impact space, because I really believe that there's a way that we can show leadership about how to use some of these tools ethically and appropriately.\n\n19:48\n\nAnd I'll see you guys tomorrow.",
