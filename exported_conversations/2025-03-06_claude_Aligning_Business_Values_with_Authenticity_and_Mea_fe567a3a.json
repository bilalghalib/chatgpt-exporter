What makes you feel alive in your work? What keeps you going even when it’s hard? We’re building businesses here, but we’re also building something bigger—meaning, impact, purpose. Ethics isn’t just about avoiding trouble; it’s about waking up to what matters and letting that drive us. So, let’s dig in.”\n**Discussion Questions (10 minutes):**\n* What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you hear ‘ethics’? What’s it mean to you?\n* In business, what does living ethically look like day-to-day? How’s it different from just ‘running a company’?\n* How does staying true to what you believe in—your ‘why’—help a business last, grow, or even thrive in tough times?\n* Who’s touched by your business (customers, workers, neighbors, the planet)? Why does keeping them in mind feel worth it?\nEncourage real stories—maybe someone’s seen a business cut corners and lose trust, or another doubled down on values and won loyalty. Let it flow naturally.\n**Wrap-Up Points (2-3 minutes):** “Some of you might’ve mentioned laws—like, ‘ethics is following the rules.’ Fair. But laws are just a starting line. Others might’ve said it’s about doing right by people, even when no one’s checking. That’s where it gets juicy. Let’s break it into two ways to think about ethics—and how they light up a business.”\n**Two Paths to Ethics: Compliance vs. Values**\n**1. Compliance-Based: The Baseline**\n* **What it is:** Doing what’s required—following laws, checking boxes, avoiding penalties. Think: “Don’t get sued, don’t get fined.”\n* **The vibe:** It’s about not screwing up. Do no harm (hopefully). Stick to the rules of the game—laws, industry standards, whatever’s written down.\n* **The catch:** Laws aren’t perfect. What’s legal in one place (say, lax waste disposal) might trash a community elsewhere. In Iraq, we’ve got our own rules and gaps—compliance might keep you safe, but it won’t make you stand out.\n* **Business lens:** It’s survival mode. Customers might not notice, and workers might not care. It’s steady, but it’s not alive.\n**2. Values-Based: The Fire**\n* **What it is:** Going beyond the minimum because you’ve got a ‘why’—a reason that makes your business feel real. It’s choosing to do good, not just avoid harm, based on what you and your team stand for.\n* **The vibe:** This is where you come alive. It’s self-driven—acting with guts and heart even when no one’s watching. Maybe it’s cutting waste because you hate seeing it pile up, or hiring locals because you’ve felt the sting of exclusion. It’s extra effort, sure, but it’s effort that fits *you*.\n* **The ‘why’ power:** Like that old saying, ‘He who has a strong enough why can overcome any how.’ When your business runs on values that mean something—sustainability, fairness, community—you’ll push through chaos, find solutions, and keep going.\n* **Business wins:**\n   * **Customers feel it:** People don’t just buy products; they buy stories, trust, authenticity. A business alive with purpose pulls them in—think of a café composting scraps or a shop training refugees.\n   * **Team stays lit:** Workers stick around when they’re part of something bigger than a paycheck.\n   * **Sustainability clicks:** Values like resourcefulness or care for the earth aren’t just ‘nice’—they save cash, dodge risks, and future-proof you.\n   * **Stand out:** In a noisy market, a real ‘why’ cuts through.\n**Tie-in to Green Goals:** “Here in Erbil, with Five One Labs, we’re not just building startups—we’re greening them. Values-based ethics fits that. Cutting waste, rethinking resources, lifting up locals—it’s not extra baggage; it’s the edge. A business that’s authentic and alive doesn’t just survive; it grows roots and draws people in.”",

            "extracted_content": "Here's an updated version of your ethics discussion that aligns with your focus on authenticity, coming alive, and the business benefits of aligning values with meaning. It connects to the idea that businesses thrive when they embody a deep \"why\" and cultivate meaningful relationships with customers and stakeholders. This version also frames ethics as a source of strategic strength and long-term sustainability, rather than just compliance or obligation.\n\n15-Minute Discussion: Ethics and Business That Comes Alive\nEthics isn’t just about rules—it’s about what makes a business truly meaningful, sustainable, and connected to the people it serves. Businesses that thrive over the long term do so because they align with values that matter—not just to themselves, but to their customers, employees, and communities.\n\nLet’s explore what ethics means in business. Some questions to consider:\n\nWhat do ethics mean to you? How do they show up in the business world?\nWhat businesses do you trust the most? Why?\nHow do ethical values help businesses attract customers and build long-term relationships?\nWho is impacted by your business? What happens when businesses act in ways that respect or harm their stakeholders?\nHave you ever been in a situation where a business decision felt wrong, even if it was legal? What did that teach you about the difference between compliance and deeper values?\nTwo Approaches to Ethics\n1. Compliance-Based Ethics – Doing the Minimum\nThis is the \"stay out of trouble\" model. Businesses following this approach focus on:\n\nFollowing laws and regulations (which vary across regions and may not always align with deeper moral values).\nAvoiding harm or penalties rather than proactively doing good.\nChecking boxes rather than engaging in true responsibility.\nMany businesses operate this way, but it often leads to short-term thinking, loss of trust, and disconnection from customers and employees who crave something more meaningful.\n\n2. Values-Based Ethics – Making Your Business Come Alive\nThis approach sees ethics as an engine for long-term success. It’s about aligning your business with its deepest why—because when businesses act in ways that resonate with meaning, they attract people who believe in them. This model includes:\n\nDoing good, not just avoiding harm. Moving beyond the bare minimum to create real impact.\nAligning with core values. Businesses that live their values build stronger customer loyalty and employee commitment.\nSelf-regulation and integrity. Doing the right thing, even when no one is watching, builds a reputation that attracts partners, customers, and investors.\nPutting in the extra effort. The best businesses are not just efficient; they are deeply aligned with their purpose, and that makes them magnetic.\nThe Business Case for Values-Based Ethics\nCustomers choose brands that reflect their own values. Trust is the foundation of business, and ethical businesses attract loyal customers.\nEmployees want to work for companies that stand for something. People give their best when they feel their work is meaningful.\nInvestors and partners increasingly value long-term sustainability. Ethical businesses often outperform competitors because they minimize risk and create deeper trust.\nResilience in crisis. A strong values foundation helps businesses navigate challenges while maintaining their integrity and support systems.\nAt the core, ethics isn’t a restriction—it’s an opportunity. A business that understands why it exists and aligns its actions with that deeper meaning will always find how to succeed.\n\nThis version shifts the focus from ethics as a constraint to ethics as a catalyst for meaningful, successful businesses. It reflects your belief that businesses thrive when they align with values that resonate deeply with their customers and stakeholders. Let me know if you want any refinements!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nis there any research with statstics and numbers we can include in the text? \nChatGPT said:\nIntegrating empirical data into your ethics discussion can substantiate the business advantages of aligning ethical practices with core values.

What makes you feel alive in your work? What keeps you going even when it's hard? We're building businesses here, but we're also building something bigger—meaning, impact, purpose. Ethics isn't just about avoiding trouble; it's about waking up to what matters and letting that drive us. So, let's dig in.\"\n\n**Discussion Questions (10 minutes):**\n* What's the first thing that comes to mind when you hear 'ethics'? What's it mean to you?\n* In business, what does living ethically look like day-to-day? How's it different from just 'running a company'?\n* How does staying true to what you believe in—your 'why'—help a business last, grow, or even thrive in tough times?\n* Who's touched by your business (customers, workers, neighbors, the planet)? Why does keeping them in mind feel worth it?\n\nEncourage real stories—maybe someone's seen a business cut corners and lose trust, or another doubled down on values and won loyalty. Let it flow naturally.\n\n**Wrap-Up Points (2-3 minutes):** \"Some of you might've mentioned laws—like, 'ethics is following the rules.' Fair. But laws are just a starting line. Others might've said it's about doing right by people, even when no one's checking. That's where it gets juicy. Let's break it into two ways to think about ethics—and how they light up a business.\"\n\n**Two Paths to Ethics: Compliance vs. Values**\n\n**1. Compliance-Based: The Baseline**\n* **What it is:** Doing what's required—following laws, checking boxes, avoiding penalties. Think: \"Don't get sued, don't get fined.\"\n* **The vibe:** It's about not screwing up. Do no harm (hopefully). Stick to the rules of the game—laws, industry standards, whatever's written down.\n* **The catch:** Laws aren't perfect. What's legal in one place (say, lax waste disposal) might trash a community elsewhere. In Iraq, we've got our own rules and gaps—compliance might keep you safe, but it won't make you stand out.\n* **Business lens:** It's survival mode. Customers might not notice, and workers might not care. It's steady, but it's not alive.\n\n**2. Values-Based: The Fire**\n* **What it is:** Going beyond the minimum because you've got a 'why'—a reason that makes your business feel real. It's choosing to do good, not just avoid harm, based on what you and your team stand for.\n* **The vibe:** This is where you come alive. It's self-driven—acting with guts and heart even when no one's watching. Maybe it's cutting waste because you hate seeing it pile up, or hiring locals because you've felt the sting of exclusion. It's extra effort, sure, but it's effort that fits *you*.\n* **The 'why' power:** Like that old saying, 'He who has a strong enough why can overcome any how.' When your business runs on values that mean something—sustainability, fairness, community—you'll push through chaos, find solutions, and keep going.\n* **Business wins:**\n   * **Customers feel it:** People don't just buy products; they buy stories, trust, authenticity. A business alive with purpose pulls them in—think of a café composting scraps or a shop training refugees.\n   * **Team stays lit:** Workers stick around when they're part of something bigger than a paycheck.\n   * **Sustainability clicks:** Values like resourcefulness or care for the earth aren't just 'nice'—they save cash, dodge risks, and future-proof you.\n   * **Stand out:** In a noisy market, a real 'why' cuts through.\n\n**Tie-in to Green Goals:** \"Here in Erbil, with Five One Labs, we're not just building startups—we're greening them. Values-based ethics fits that. Cutting waste, rethinking resources, lifting up locals—it's not extra baggage; it's the edge. A business that's authentic and alive doesn't just survive; it grows roots and draws people in.\"",

McDonald's occasionally 'goes green' by changing their iconic golden arches to green in some locations or launching eco-initiatives. But does painting arches green make a fast-food chain genuinely sustainable or healthy? This is what we call 'greenwashing' – when a business appears environmentally conscious without making substantive changes aligned with those values.\n\nAsk participants: Can you think of other examples where businesses claim values they don't authentically embody? What's the difference between marketing values and living them? How do customers respond when they discover this disconnect?\n\nThe point isn't to criticize McDonald's specifically, but to recognize that values only matter when they're authentic and activated. Otherwise, they're just words on a mission statement that nobody believes – including you.\"\n\n## Slide 2: Finding Your True North\n\n**UNCOVER YOUR CORE VALUES**\n* What moments in your work make you feel most alive?\n* What injustice or problem can't you walk away from?\n* What would you build even if it were difficult?\n* Who do you deeply want to serve, and why?\n* What principles would you refuse to compromise, even for profit?\n\n**Facilitator Notes:**\n\"Let's move beyond generic corporate values like 'innovation' or 'integrity' that could apply to any business. Those words only matter when they connect to something deeply meaningful to you.\n\nThe exercise we're about to do isn't about picking nice-sounding words – it's about uncovering the true sources of meaning that will sustain you through challenges and help you find your aligned tribe of customers, employees, and investors.\n\nHave participants spend 3-5 minutes reflecting on the questions on the slide. Then ask them to write down 2-3 values that emerge from their answers – not generic terms, but specific principles they won't compromise on.\n\nFor example, instead of 'responsibility,' they might write 'creating products that don't harm the environment my children will inherit.' Instead of 'innovation,' they might write 'solving problems others have ignored for people who've been overlooked.'\n\nThe goal is to identify values specific enough that they would disqualify certain business decisions and attract certain customers. Values so authentic that activating them feels like coming alive, not checking a box.\n\nThese deeply-held values become your compass for the triple bottom line business model we'll discuss next – showing how your business can create profit while honoring what truly matters to you.\"\n\nWhat do you think about this approach?

      "content": "How do we go from the slide with a list of words to something ... more? this is a bit much, we need it more short and toned down, and something like this : [[[**Facilitator Notes**\n**(3-4 minutes) Slide 1: Why Over Words**\n* **Open with a Punch:** “We’ve all seen values like ‘integrity’ on a wall somewhere. But if they’re just decorations, they’re dead. Let’s find the ones that make you feel alive. What would your customers miss if you were gone tomorrow? What’s the heartbeat of your business?”\n* **Prompt Them:** Get 1-2 quick answers—e.g., “I’d miss the jobs we give,” or “Our coffee’s the only thing keeping this street buzzing.” Tie it to meaning: “That’s your ‘why’—not a rule, but a reason.”\n* **Set the Stage:** “Today, we’re not listing values. We’re digging for the purpose that makes them real—and makes people care.”\n**(3-4 minutes) Slide 2: Truth or Trash**\n* **Quick Rundown:** “Look at these—McDonald’s says ‘sustainability,’ but it’s a side hustle, not their soul. Volkswagen preached ‘integrity’ while cheating. Then there’s Patagonia—sustainability’s their bones, not their billboard. Or imagine Fatima’s Bakery here in Erbil—feeding people, lifting locals, using every crumb. That’s alive.”\n* **Engage Them:** “What’s a business you’ve seen fake it? What about one that feels real?” (Expect nods on big brands, maybe local tales.)\n* **Link It:** “Customers and investors don’t buy words—they feel truth. When your ‘why’ shines, they line up.”\n**(3-4 minutes) Slide 3: Green Paint Ain’t Enough**\n* **Dive In:** “McDonald’s tried ‘green’—salads, eco-ads. But it’s lipstick on a burger chain. Their core’s still cheap and fast, not healthy or green. People see through it. Trust fades. Real change would mean rewriting their ‘why’—not slapping a sticker on it.”\n* **Challenge Them:** “What’s one ‘green’ move that’d feel fake for your business? Now, what’s one that’d feel true to your core?”\n* **Bridge It:** “That’s where we’re headed—values that aren’t just talk but action, rooted in a purpose that fits *you*. Let’s build that into your triple bottom line next.”\n**Transition:**\n“Now, take that ‘why’—that thing you’d be missed for—and let’s turn it into a strategy. How do you live it through profit, people, and planet? That’s where the magic happens.”\n**Why This Works for You**\n* **Sources of Meaning:** Slide 1’s “What would they miss?” cuts to the gut—what matters enough to fight for? That’s your Erbil entrepreneurs’ fuel—resilience, hope, community.\n* **Coming Alive:** It’s not “responsibility” as a chore—it’s a purpose that wakes you up. Fatima’s Bakery (or a real local swap) grounds it in their world.\n* **Authenticity:** The McDonald’s takedown and Patagonia nod scream your “no BS” vibe—greenwashing’s a lie, and you’re calling it out.\n* **Business Benefits:** Customers and investors don’t just see value—they feel it.

            "text": "How do we go from the slide with a list of words to something ... more? this is a bit much, we need it more short and toned down, and something like this : [[[**Facilitator Notes**\n**(3-4 minutes) Slide 1: Why Over Words**\n* **Open with a Punch:** “We’ve all seen values like ‘integrity’ on a wall somewhere. But if they’re just decorations, they’re dead. Let’s find the ones that make you feel alive. What would your customers miss if you were gone tomorrow? What’s the heartbeat of your business?”\n* **Prompt Them:** Get 1-2 quick answers—e.g., “I’d miss the jobs we give,” or “Our coffee’s the only thing keeping this street buzzing.” Tie it to meaning: “That’s your ‘why’—not a rule, but a reason.”\n* **Set the Stage:** “Today, we’re not listing values. We’re digging for the purpose that makes them real—and makes people care.”\n**(3-4 minutes) Slide 2: Truth or Trash**\n* **Quick Rundown:** “Look at these—McDonald’s says ‘sustainability,’ but it’s a side hustle, not their soul. Volkswagen preached ‘integrity’ while cheating. Then there’s Patagonia—sustainability’s their bones, not their billboard. Or imagine Fatima’s Bakery here in Erbil—feeding people, lifting locals, using every crumb. That’s alive.”\n* **Engage Them:** “What’s a business you’ve seen fake it? What about one that feels real?” (Expect nods on big brands, maybe local tales.)\n* **Link It:** “Customers and investors don’t buy words—they feel truth. When your ‘why’ shines, they line up.”\n**(3-4 minutes) Slide 3: Green Paint Ain’t Enough**\n* **Dive In:** “McDonald’s tried ‘green’—salads, eco-ads. But it’s lipstick on a burger chain. Their core’s still cheap and fast, not healthy or green. People see through it. Trust fades. Real change would mean rewriting their ‘why’—not slapping a sticker on it.”\n* **Challenge Them:** “What’s one ‘green’ move that’d feel fake for your business? Now, what’s one that’d feel true to your core?”\n* **Bridge It:** “That’s where we’re headed—values that aren’t just talk but action, rooted in a purpose that fits *you*. Let’s build that into your triple bottom line next.”\n**Transition:**\n“Now, take that ‘why’—that thing you’d be missed for—and let’s turn it into a strategy. How do you live it through profit, people, and planet? That’s where the magic happens.”\n**Why This Works for You**\n* **Sources of Meaning:** Slide 1’s “What would they miss?” cuts to the gut—what matters enough to fight for? That’s your Erbil entrepreneurs’ fuel—resilience, hope, community.\n* **Coming Alive:** It’s not “responsibility” as a chore—it’s a purpose that wakes you up. Fatima’s Bakery (or a real local swap) grounds it in their world.\n* **Authenticity:** The McDonald’s takedown and Patagonia nod scream your “no BS” vibe—greenwashing’s a lie, and you’re calling it out.\n* **Business Benefits:** Customers and investors don’t just see value—they feel it. A living ‘why’ builds tribes, not transactions.\n* **Iraq Context:** Subtle nods to local grit (e.g., Fatima’s) tie it to their reality—sustainability isn’t fancy, it’s survival with soul.\nThis isn’t abstract—it’s visceral. It’s less “here’s a value” and more “what’s your fight?” That’s how you get them to speak authentically, hook the right crowd, and build something lasting. Any local examples you’d weave in? Or a tweak to sharpen it more?]]]\n\nWe have this on the slides [[[**THINK ABOUT YOUR CORE VALUES**\nResponsibility\nInnovation\nTeamwork\nCommitment\nIntegrity]]]\n\nThe slide after says [[[people profit planet ]]] and has this as facilitator notes[[[**2-3 minutes: Lecture**\n* As a business, you will have an impact on so many different people just by existing.  You have an impact on your customers, your employees, the shareholders of your company, the communities you operate in, and the planet we live on.

Ethics aren’t just rules to follow—they represent your deeper 'why' and drive your business forward, especially in challenging times.\"\nDiscussion Questions (10 minutes):\nWhen someone says 'ethics,' what's the first thing that comes to your mind?\nHow can authenticity provide your business with unique advantages that competitors can't easily replicate?\nWhat impact does alignment with a founder's deepest values have on business success?\nCan you recall a moment when you felt genuinely alive and motivated by your work? How can that kind of energy enhance business performance?\nHave you seen examples where businesses succeeded specifically because they stayed true to their core values? What happened?\nWho are the stakeholders impacted by your business (customers, employees, local community, environment)? Why does considering their well-being contribute to your long-term success?\nEncourage participants to share real examples—situations where businesses either lost trust by cutting corners or built loyalty by sticking firmly to their values.\nAs the conversation progresses, highlight the two fundamental approaches to ethics:\nWrap-Up Points (2-3 minutes):\n\"We've talked about two main pathways businesses can take regarding ethics—Compliance-based and Values-based. Let's briefly explore each:\"\nCompliance-Based Ethics: Playing Safe\nDoing what's legally required—meeting regulations and avoiding penalties.\nPrimarily focused on avoiding problems and doing no harm.\nLimitations: Laws differ by location, and simply following rules doesn't create deeper connections with customers or employees.\nValues-Based Ethics: Igniting Purpose\nGoing beyond compliance because you have a meaningful purpose and clear core values.\nActing authentically, proactively, and ethically—even when nobody is watching—because your 'why' genuinely drives you.\nWillingness to put in extra effort aligned with your values, making your work more purposeful and fulfilling.\nWhy Values Ignite Your Business:\nCustomer Connection: People support businesses whose values align with theirs. Authenticity builds trust, loyalty, and lasting customer relationships.\nTeam Loyalty: Employees remain engaged and motivated when their work serves a meaningful purpose beyond financial compensation.\nLong-term Resilience: Businesses guided by strong, clear values can more effectively adapt to challenges and thrive amid uncertainty.\nCompetitive Edge: Authenticity differentiates your business clearly and powerfully in crowded markets.\nClosing Thought:\nWe aren't just building startups—we're cultivating purpose-driven businesses that attract customers, inspire communities, and stand the test of time. Ethics, grounded in authenticity and values, can become your a strategic advantage.\nAs Epictetus famously said:\n\"First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to.\"\n]]]\n\n\nOriginal text[[[\n15 minutes: Discussion\n\nHave a discussion around ethics. Some questions you might want to ask to encourage discussion include:\nCan someone tell me what they know about ethics?\nWhat do ethics look like in the business context? What are ethics in business? \nHow are business ethics and high ethical standards linked to business sustainability?\nWho are all of the people impacted by your business (stakeholders)? Why is it important to take care of them?\n\nSome of these points probably came up in the discussion. Maybe someone mentioned following the law as a part of ethics. Or not, so you can bring it up now. \nBasically, there are 2 types of ethics:\nCompliance based: This is doing the bare minimum. You follow the laws and do what you are supposed to do. The idea here is not to do any harm. However, sometimes the laws might not be perfect and still do harm. This is difficult because laws are different in different locations because of cultural differences. What might not be ethical in some cultures (child labor for instance), are perfectly accepted in other places in the world. \nDo no harm (hopefully)\nFollow laws\nFollow guidelines provided by an organization or group telling you what you can and can’t do. \nPenalties for violations\n\nValues based: Because laws aren’t perfect, they leave room for businesses to damage people, communities, and the environment. Based on personal choices and values (without disregarding logical business rationale), you can choose to have your business have a positive impact on society. It takes a bit of extra work, but your business will have an impact on so many people. Some people might argue that you have a moral duty to do good with your business. \nDo good. Do more than the minimum legal requirements and expectations to do what you think is right. \nCompany core values. Act with your company core values in mind.\nSelf regulation. Hold yourself accountable and do good even when nobody’s watching.\nExtra effort. Put in a little extra effort to be the best version of your business that can possibly exist. \n3\n\n5 Minutes: Discussion - Ethics: Living Values That Ignite Business Continued\nDiscussion Questions (2-3 minutes):\nWhat is your strong why? What “why” will keep you going when things are hard? What values and ethical ways of doing business will inspire you, help you find aligned funders, team members and customers? \n4\n\n3-5 minutes: Discussion:\n\nAsk: What do you think about this video? How do you think it was received by the public?\n\n3 minutes: Lecture\nShare some actual figures about this video:\n$101,000 budget to make the video\n+$150,000,000 in returns\n3x more views than some Super Bowl commercials\nThis video caused the largest traffic spike to their website\nTheir story was featured all over the news and on shows like Ellen.\n5\n\n“Brands with a purpose grow faster”\nUNILEVER STRATEGY\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nUnilever is the +$62.6 billion/yr company that owns Dove and many other international brands. \nAfter researching, they discovered with bottom line evidence that “Brands with a purpose grow faster” (twice as fast for some of their companies). Their internal data showed that 15% of growth came from brands that had a purpose. Therefore, they made a strategic decision to adjust their strategy to make sure that all of their brands have an activated brand purpose. \n“The cost of inaction is a lot more than taking action”- Jonathan Atwood VP of communications and sustainable living at Unlilever.\n\nShort discussion: Can you think of a business you interact with because you align with their values and purpose?\n6\n\nMcDonalds, Green and Healthy?\n3-5 minutes: Discuss\nIs McDonald's known to be a green and healthy restaurant?\nWhy did McDonalds go “green” in Europe?\nIs this an authentic display of McDonald’s core values?

Actions that connect with people, profit, and planet—what we call the triple bottom line. That's where we're headed next.\"\u000b]]]\n\nOriginal [[[ 3-5 minutes: Lecture\n\nThis slide is a placeholder so that entrepreneurs can take out their core values and mission statements from Ignite.\nWhat we will do now is think about ways to actually accomplish our stated values through the triple bottom line business model. How can you “activate” the purpose behind your business (instead of just having values that are never worked towards accomplishing)?]]]\n9\n\nWHO ARE YOUR STAKEHOLDERS?\u000b\nPEOPLE\nPLANET\nPROFIT\n2-3 minutes: Lecture\nAs a business, you will have an impact on so many different people just by existing.  You have an impact on your customers, your employees, the shareholders of your company, the communities you operate in, and the planet we live on. This impact could be positive or negative and it all depends on the choices you make as the leader of your company. Therefore, you should actively think through how your business decisions will impact all of your different stakeholders. \nWe will look at the triple bottom line business model to do this. When you think of a “bottom line”, traditionally that means a solely profit driven business (bottom line of a P&L), but there are businesses who are driven for other reasons as well (people driven companies, environmentally driven companies, etc…)\nOver the next few slides, spend time in each category to brainstorm things entrepreneurs can do right now or in the near future to be more ethical and ultimately, more sustainable in these 3 categories (representing the Triple Bottom Line model):\nPeople\nPlanet\nProfit\n\nTrainer tip: Over the next few slides, try to avoid answers such as “make donations” or “give away free products”. Those things are great, but try to get the entrepreneurs to think about how their core of their business’ existence can be rooted in uplifting the world. Donations and giveaways are great, but they aren’t sustainable on their own. We will discuss “good answers” on the next slides. These things can include using less plastic in packaging, having a transparent and fair hiring process, etc…).\n10\n\nPEOPLE\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nHave a discussion on ways to positively impact all the people who interact with your business or are impacted by it in some way.\nWrite all the answers on the board.\nAs people share answers, try to go deeper and show how these “ethical” actions actually have a positive impact on your business as well\nAsk: What are things that your business can do to have a positive impact on people? \nPotential answers:\nCommunity: \nEducational events and workshops related to your mission for community members, customers, employees, etc…\nPartnerships and collaborations with other businesses or organizations working towards the same mission\nHire from your local community. Job creation stimulates growth.\nHire vulnerable or marginalized people\nTackle social issues through company policy and actions\nEmployees:\nPay employees well\nGive employees benefits\nProvide education or personal development opportunities\nEnsure fair (or good) hours and working conditions\nCustomers:\nYour business should be solving a problem for them\nYour products should be safe and not cause any harm\nListen and respect them\n\nExamples you can give:\nChobani Yogurt has a policy to hire refugees which positively affects society \nStarbucks has a policy to hire veterans and refugees. They also have policies to prevent food waste and give food to people in need within their communities. \n\nTrainer tip: If entrepreneurs are having a hard time coming up with answers, consider asking “What are some ethical companies you know about? How do they treat their employees and community? What do they do that inspires you?\n11\n\nPROFIT\n5 minutes: Discussion\nIn the triple bottom line model, profits are important, but not always the driving force. At the end of the day, you have to remember that you have to make a profit. It is great to do good, but if you can’t sustain yourself your business won’t last. \nAsk: How can you actually implement some of those ideas from before while also keeping profitability in mind? \nPotential answers:\nConduct a cost benefit analysis on the ideas to see which owns are most “beneficial”\nOnly do things that you can afford to do\nFind other companies or organizations to donate to your cause and \nIntegrate ethics into your business model in a way that ethical behavior is always profitable!\nEtc…\n\nMore information on the examples you from the “People slide”:\nChobani Yogurt has a policy to hire refugees which positively affects society (this does not affect profits at all)\nStarbucks has a policy to hire veterans and refugees. They also have policies to prevent food waste and give food to people in need within their communities. (these decisions have actually had a positive effect on Starbucks profitability from the good publicity)\n\n12\n\nPLANET\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nHave a discussion on ways to positively impact all the environment and planet with your business.\nWrite all the answers on the board.\nAs people share answers, try to go deeper and show how these “ethical” actions actually have a positive impact on your business as well\nAsk: What are things that your business can do to have a positive impact on the planet? \nPotential answers:\nConsider circular business models that use a different way of producing and consuming goods to be more environmentally friendly and “circular” (in a way that mimics natures). This can include using recycled materials in production or incentivizing customers to return products to the company where it can be refurbished or reused in another way (circular model). Avoid extracting things from the earth, giving it to the customers, and putting it in a landfill (this is a linear model).\nRecycle when you can \nReduce consumption and try to conserve natural resources\nReuse when you can instead of creating more waste\nRepair old or broken materials instead of throwing them out\nDonate excess materials/goods instead of throwing them out\nStreamline processes and remove unnecessary steps\nThink of ways to have a better impact on water & air quality, \n\nTrainer tip: If entrepreneurs are having a hard time coming up with answers, consider asking “What are some ethical companies you know about? What do they do to positively impact the environment? What do they do that inspires you?\n\n13\n\nHIGH STANDARDS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nSo, how do companies that are genuinely doing good work stand out from the others? Because of case studies like Unilever, being ethical or “green” is now a major trend. Many companies try to use this as a marketing tool (greenwashing) to appear responsible while continuing unsustainable or unethical practices.\nAsk: Where have you seen companies misleading customers about their ethical or sustainable efforts?\n Green packaging or “earthy” branding that doesn’t reflect real sustainability efforts.\n Companies that advertise ‘clean’ energy but still rely on environmentally harmful extraction methods.\n Businesses that claim ethical labor practices but have supply chains with questionable working conditions.\n\nAsk: Given that every company wants to appear ethical, how do you stand out as truly trustworthy and credible?\n Actually follow through on ethical commitments\n Put clear policies and procedures in place\n Use third-party certifications to validate claims and enhance credibility, such as:\n ISO\n LEED-certified (sustainable building)\n Organic-certified\n Fair Trade\n Rainforest Alliance\n B Corporation certification\n Trainer Tip: Encourage participants to think beyond avoiding greenwashing. A strong business culture based on trust and transparency leads to long-term brand loyalty, customer retention, and better investment opportunities.\n\n\n[[Original Version]]\nSo how do the companies who are doing great legitimate work stand out from the others? Because of case studies like Unilever, and McDonald’s being ethical or “green” is trendy now. There are so many people “greenwashing” to get good press to make people think they are doing good so that it will have a positive impact on their sales. \nAsk: Where have you seen this before? How are people faking ethics?\nGreen packaging or packaging with plants on it. \nCompanies that say one thing and do another.\nNatural gas/hydraulic fracking companies that advertise “clean” energy (it burns clean, but extracting it is very harmful for the environment).\n\nAsk: Given the fact that everyone wants to appear ethical, how do you stand out from the others? How do you separate the fakers from the people actually doing good work?\nActually do good things with evidence\nPut policies and procedures into place and enforce them\n3rd party product certifications:\nISO\nLEEDS certified\nOrganic\nFair trade\nRainforest alliance\nB certified\nEtc…\nHave these standards to avoid greenwashing “marketing”\n\n14\n\nLIVING YOUR VALUES, NOT JUST MARKETING THEM\nNew: [[ Facilitator Notes (5 minutes: Discussion)\n\"We've talked about finding values that truly matter to you and activating them through the triple bottom line. But in a world where 'ethical' and 'green' have become marketing buzzwords, how do businesses that genuinely live their values stand out from those just wearing the costume?\"\nTransition: \"This disconnect between what companies claim and what they do has a name: 'greenwashing' or 'ethics washing.' It happens when values become marketing tools rather than authentic guides for decisions.\"\nAsk: \"How can your business demonstrate that your values run deeper than marketing? How do you build trust that your 'why' is genuine?\"\nGuide toward concrete answers:\n\"Make choices that might cost you something in the short term but align with your values\"\n\"Be transparent about both your successes and challenges\"\n\"Invite verification through certification programs relevant to your sector:\"\nISO standards for quality and environmental management\nOrganic certification for food products\nFair Trade for ethical supply chains\nB Corporation certification for overall social and environmental performance\nConnect back to meaning: \"The strongest businesses don't just meet standards—they set them based on what truly matters to them. When values come from an authentic source of meaning, customers don't just see compliance—they feel conviction. That's what builds loyalty that marketing can't buy.\"\nBridge to application: \"Now, thinking about your specific business and the values we've been discussing, what's one concrete action you could take this month that would demonstrate your commitment isn't just talk?\"\n]]]\n\n\n[[Original Version]]\nSo how do the companies who are doing great legitimate work stand out from the others?

What will you do to accomplish your mission? How will you really accomplish those things and have an ACTIVATED BRAND PURPOSE? What problem is your business really solving? Think about your customers/employees/community needs and how you can best support them. Based on your mission statement and care values, what are 3 things you want to change in the world? You will create a system to create and measure your impact. You can measure impact in a lot of ways! Feel free to measure anything you want, but make sure you are measuring impact in a way that is aligned with your mission and business! If you are able to track what you are doing, you can make an impact report that would be useful to share with donors, investors, or even put on your website and share with your customers!\nWhat we will do now is look at a well known certification assessment that will help you evaluate your impact on all of the different stakeholders. \n\n1 hour: Activity\nFor the rest of the session, take each of these categories and list how you can impact each of these stakeholder groups. \nTake a B Impact Assessment for your business: https://app.bimpactassessment.net/login\nYou probably wont know all the answers to these questions, that is ok. It will help give you ideas to incorporate into your strategy and help you see where your business stands.\nKeep in mind, you need an 80 to pass and it is not an easy test to pass!\n\n 15 minutes: Share\nBreak into small groups of 3-5 people\nDiscuss the different strategies you thought of and get feedback from the group\nAre the ways they are choosing to measure impact aligned with their mission?\nShare ideas to help each business come up with really unique strategies to make a difference based on their particular business model!\n\n17\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS:\nUpdate your mission statement (if necessary)\nFinish the B Impact Assessment.\nIdentify 3 areas of impact that you care about and want to measure.\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n18\n\n\nTHANK YOU\nANY QUESTIONS?\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n19]]]"

      "content": " After reviewing all the slides, here's my assessment of how to streamline and align them for a more coherent presentation on business ethics:\n\n# Slides to Remove/Consolidate\n\n1. **Remove Slide 14 (LIVING YOUR VALUES) OR Slide 15 (RISE ABOVE \"VALUESWASHING\")** - These are essentially duplicate slides with very similar content. I recommend keeping Slide 14 with the updated facilitator notes and removing Slide 15.\n\n2. **Remove Slide 4 (Video Discussion)** - While the Dove video is powerful, it feels disconnected from the core flow about ethics and values. The emphasis on marketing metrics ($101,000 budget, $150M returns) also sends a mixed message when we're trying to emphasize authentic values over marketing tactics.\n\n3. **Consider removing or condensing Slide 5 (UNILEVER STRATEGY)** - While it provides a business case for purpose-driven brands, it feels more like a marketing strategy slide than an authentic values discussion. If kept, it needs to be reframed as \"even large corporations are recognizing the business benefits of authentic values.\"\n\n# Flow Recommendations\n\nHere's a suggested sequence that creates a more cohesive flow:\n\n1. **Slide 1-2**: Introduction and objectives (keep as is)\n\n2. **Slide 3**: \"WHAT ARE ETHICS?\" (with your updated content about living values that ignite business)\n\n3. **Slide 7+8**: Combine these two slides about \"FROM WORDS TO PURPOSE\" - Start with the generic values list (Innovation, Teamwork, etc.) and immediately show the contrast table with McDonald's vs. Patagonia to make your point visually.\n\n4. **Slide 6**: Move the McDonald's \"green\" example here as a specific case study of values disconnection that students can analyze.\n\n5. **Slide 9**: WHO ARE YOUR STAKEHOLDERS? / Triple Bottom Line (People, Planet, Profit)\n\n6. **Slides 10-12**: Keep the People, Profit, Planet slides in this order\n\n7. **Slide 14**: LIVING YOUR VALUES (with updated facilitator notes)\n\n8. **Slide 16-19**: Keep the Impact Metrics activity and wrap-up\n\n# Content Alignment Recommendations\n\nTo create better alignment between the slides:\n\n1. **Unifying Theme**: \"From Values to Purpose to Impact\" - Make this the clear progression throughout the presentation.\n\n2. **Consistent Language**: Use consistent terms throughout - either \"values-based ethics\" or \"purpose-driven business\" but not both interchangeably.\n\n3. **Connect McDonald's Example**: Use the McDonald's example consistently - start with it as a generic reference in your ethics discussion, show it visually in the contrast table, then examine it in depth in the dedicated slide.\n\n4. **Strengthen Triple Bottom Line Connection**: Make explicit the connection between authentic values and the triple bottom line - show how values don't just exist in the abstract but must be expressed through concrete decisions about people, planet, and profit.\n\n5. **Bridge to Metrics**: Create a stronger connection between the values discussion and the impact metrics activity - \"We've talked about what genuine values look like; now let's create a system to measure if we're actually living them.\"\n\nThe overall flow should feel like:\n1. What are meaningful values vs. empty words?\n2. How do we activate values through the triple bottom line?\n3. How do we demonstrate and verify our authenticity?\n4. How do we measure the impact of our values in action?\n\nThis revised structure maintains your core material while creating a more intuitive learning journey from understanding ethics to implementing and measuring a values-based approach to business.",

If kept, it needs to be reframed as \"even large corporations are recognizing the business benefits of authentic values.\"\n\n# Flow Recommendations\n\nHere's a suggested sequence that creates a more cohesive flow:\n\n1. **Slide 1-2**: Introduction and objectives (keep as is)\n\n2. **Slide 3**: \"WHAT ARE ETHICS?\" (with your updated content about living values that ignite business)\n\n3. **Slide 7+8**: Combine these two slides about \"FROM WORDS TO PURPOSE\" - Start with the generic values list (Innovation, Teamwork, etc.) and immediately show the contrast table with McDonald's vs. Patagonia to make your point visually.\n\n4. **Slide 6**: Move the McDonald's \"green\" example here as a specific case study of values disconnection that students can analyze.\n\n5. **Slide 9**: WHO ARE YOUR STAKEHOLDERS? / Triple Bottom Line (People, Planet, Profit)\n\n6. **Slides 10-12**: Keep the People, Profit, Planet slides in this order\n\n7. **Slide 14**: LIVING YOUR VALUES (with updated facilitator notes)\n\n8. **Slide 16-19**: Keep the Impact Metrics activity and wrap-up\n\n# Content Alignment Recommendations\n\nTo create better alignment between the slides:\n\n1. **Unifying Theme**: \"From Values to Purpose to Impact\" - Make this the clear progression throughout the presentation.\n\n2. **Consistent Language**: Use consistent terms throughout - either \"values-based ethics\" or \"purpose-driven business\" but not both interchangeably.\n\n3. **Connect McDonald's Example**: Use the McDonald's example consistently - start with it as a generic reference in your ethics discussion, show it visually in the contrast table, then examine it in depth in the dedicated slide.\n\n4. **Strengthen Triple Bottom Line Connection**: Make explicit the connection between authentic values and the triple bottom line - show how values don't just exist in the abstract but must be expressed through concrete decisions about people, planet, and profit.\n\n5. **Bridge to Metrics**: Create a stronger connection between the values discussion and the impact metrics activity - \"We've talked about what genuine values look like; now let's create a system to measure if we're actually living them.\"\n\nThe overall flow should feel like:\n1. What are meaningful values vs. empty words?\n2. How do we activate values through the triple bottom line?\n3. How do we demonstrate and verify our authenticity?\n4. How do we measure the impact of our values in action?\n\nThis revised structure maintains your core material while creating a more intuitive learning journey from understanding ethics to implementing and measuring a values-based approach to business.",
