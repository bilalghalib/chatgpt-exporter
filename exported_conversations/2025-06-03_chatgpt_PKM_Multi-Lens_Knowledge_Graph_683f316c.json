It feels like these two values are pulling me in different directions. Sometimes I feel guilty when I'm with my daughter because I'm thinking about the suffering in Gaza. Other times I feel guilty when I'm doing activism because I'm not being the father I want to be.\"​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​why and how do we have a values meaning and spirit difference? do we need that? how do we have a singular system that all perspectives can see themselves represented in even if it's not their language? \nI also don't see how topic maps/knowledge graphs / all the ideas are being extracted?\nWhat about arguments? Maybe we can get to the trivium, grammar, logic, rhetoric, - what would this angle bring - is there a relationship between these three and all the How what why what for what if etc? I feel like the question list is sort of a good map that can be made to be \"comprehensive\" of all that is \"knowable\" - all the things we can ask questions about\nAnd then speech actions and conformity with reality (social, or physical, or... other?) and how it also fits and constrains and has a two way map (word to world, or world to word, etc?) \n\nCan we clean this up and make it one thing and then show the diverse stakeholders reviewing the formal RFP (sort of like for the internet protocol thing) and how they see themselves in it. it can be a second order ontology, owl, knowledge graph, LLM empowered new thing - LIWC extractor, topic extractor, knowledge extractor, data, knowledge, wisdom, etc extractor... I feel like we're close yet missing something probably because I don't know what i'm talking about and I'mmising between fields and objectives - can you help me clarify that by asking questions and then taking a round of adaptations? You're absolutely right - I've been overcomplicating this by trying to force multiple frameworks together instead of finding the underlying structure. Let me ask some clarifying questions to get to the heart of what you want:\n\n## Clarifying Questions\n\n**1. Core Purpose**: Are you primarily trying to:\n- Build a personal knowledge management system that learns from your conversations?\n- Create a universal framework for extracting meaning from any text?\n- Develop a research tool for understanding how different wisdom traditions parse reality?\n- Something else entirely?\n\n**2. The Unity Question**: When you say \"singular system that all perspectives can see themselves in\" - do you mean:\n- One ontology with multiple \"views\" (like different database views of same data)?\n- One fundamental structure that generates different frameworks as special cases?\n- One extraction process that produces outputs each tradition would recognize as valid?\n\n**3. The Trivium Insight**: Are you suggesting:\n- Grammar = what is said (structure/parsing)\n- Logic = how it connects (reasoning/relationships) \n- Rhetoric = why it's said (intention/effect)\n...and this maps to your question taxonomy somehow?\n\n**4. Extraction Mechanics**: Do you want to see:\n- Concrete algorithms for going from \"I'm struggling with Palestine vs family\" to knowledge graph nodes/edges?\n- How LIWC-style linguistic features connect to philosophical categories?\n- The actual process of building topic maps from conversations?\n\n**5. Reality Conformity**: Are you thinking:\n- Word-to-world: \"assertions\" that claim to describe reality\n- World-to-word: \"directives\" that try to change reality to match words\n- And this connects to speech acts and the question types somehow?\n\n## Initial Hypothesis: The Trivium as Universal Structure\n\nBased on your hints, here's what I think you're driving toward:\n\n```\nGRAMMAR (Structure) ←→ WHAT questions\nLOGIC (Relations)   ←→ WHY/HOW questions  \nRHETORIC (Purpose)  ←→ WHAT FOR/SO WHAT questions\n```\n\nAnd maybe the \"values/meaning/spirit\" distinction collapses into:\n- **Grammar**: What exists (ontology)\n- **Logic**: How we know (epistemology) \n- **Rhetoric**: Why it matters (axiology)\n\n**Is this the direction you're pointing toward?** \n\n**And what's the specific \"missing piece\" you sense?** Is it:\n- The extraction algorithms aren't concrete enough?\n- The philosophical frameworks are too abstract for practical use?\n- The connection between linguistic features and meaning categories isn't clear?\n- Something about how this actually helps you process your conversations into useful outputs?\n\n**Give me your reaction to these questions and I'll build the unified framework you're looking for.**\nYeah. Okay. So Okay. Yeah, we can start with the penny bigger The nice thing about it is that it doesn't use LLMs, and so it can be fast. But I'm curious, like, what's the, use of it? Like, what does it actually pull out? What are the things that we can actually use and are they formal? Like, what is an idea or a concept or a topic? Or is it just like here are the patterns in the words Yeah. So it's not just Palestine test case, but it's also a test case about this. Like this idea that we're exploring the space between the trivium and knowledge graphs and topic, trees and all the stuff that we're exploring. And they're all, like, ideas and then arguments and I think it would be interesting to use it as a test case here, which would be for clarifying this, figuring out, like, the researchers that are adjacent that I think think about asking you for and, like, the different fields of knowledge in this domain around it. Like, the logic of the structure, figuring out it's rigorous and coherent, doesn't make sense. Figuring out if it's a fool's errand. Like, what my intentions are Claude helping me clarify my goals and then picking the right size project that's possible that I have the skills for, that actually makes sense, that actually iOS rigorous, that actually fits into where the conversation currently is in the research. Yeah. Community aspect, anonymous knowledge maps that people can compare. Yeah. Think something about, like, the database back end that just gets stronger and stronger that can position yourself against instead of a vector database of embeddings that are just you know, ambiguous and black box is actually, like, a more rigorous form that kind of clarifies and maybe maps to the vector embedding, but actually makes it formalized so that we can connect to it, compare it, make it semantically like a semantic engine. Can you explain what semantic engine is? Yeah. I want Claude, Lewick, attention tracking work together knowledge graph, and, like, maybe algorithms. Sure. But not necessarily tensions. But conversation to what? You know, what are all the things that we can expect from a conversation? There's Conversation tensions, like, the idea of the same media turning into maybe updating a theory of mind or or, like, the question space or the logical arguments or the questions that I have or the doubts or the researchers that are affiliated or there's just seem to be so many different things. I'm wondering what that like, formal limited way we can define it can be. Legitimate philosophical The legitimate philosophical differences, cognitive blind spots. I think that there's a truth That we maybe never can identify as it is, whether we can see in its dialectic tensions between stuff Sort of like the truth of a physical structure being a tensegrity. It's an object. You can sit on it but there's no stacked, like, physical thing right there. It's it's defined in the in betweenness. Sort of like we will never be able to see dark matter maybe, but we actually see the impact and influence of it on other things. So that there is a truth, and then each of us is talking about it and maybe a human being is too limited in its ability to merge multiple ontologies and epistemologies, and we have to kind of pick a set or be inherited a set. And that we have this way of seeing the world and this chunk, and we can try to see truth as it is and expand this, but it's I can continuing unfolding into the limitless reality. And so will never be an end to it. So something like that. Yeah. I'm not sure what other missing pieces you think I’m missing - review and answer and ask 5 new questions ",

      "content": "### Quick recap of what I’m hearing\nYou want a **meta-framework** that can:\n\n* **Ingest** any free-form conversation, journal entry, or note.  \n* **Parse** it through several “lenses” (Edelman, Taylor, Yusuf, Buddhist, MacIntyre, Krishnamurti, … + the Trivium view).  \n* **Store** the results in a **formal, inspectable knowledge graph** (not just black-box embeddings).  \n* **Surface** useful “fruits” — insights, tensions, experiments, dialogs, syntheses — that feel actionable both to you and to other stakeholders who may come from very different traditions.  \n* **Iterate** as you keep feeding the system more material, so the garden “learns” your patterns without locking you into a single worldview.\n\nBelow, I answer the five clarifying questions from the earlier list, then propose five fresh questions to keep the design work moving.\n\n---\n\n## Answers to your earlier clarifying questions\n\n| # | Question | My read of your answer (based on everything you wrote) |\n|---|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Core Purpose** | You’re building **all three at once**: <br>• *A personal PKM engine* that grows with your conversations.<br>• *A universal extraction framework* others could adopt.<br>• *A research probe* into how diverse traditions map reality.<br>But the **minimal viable core** is a personal PKM engine whose architecture is general enough to open-source later. |\n| **2. “Singular system”** | You lean toward **one underlying graph structure** plus **multiple declarative “views.”** Each lens is a view (or subgraph) that can be sliced or recombined. So **ontology ≠ viewpoint**; viewpoint is a projection. |\n| **3. Trivium mapping** | Yes: Grammar = *what* (entities/events); Logic = *how/why* (relations & causal chains); Rhetoric = *so-what / ends-in-view.* That triad can nest the values/meaning/spirit distinctions without forcing any single religious or secular vocabulary. |\n| **4. Extraction mechanics** | You **do** want concrete algorithms: syntax/lightweight NLP for Grammar; dependency edges & argument-mining for Logic; speech-act + sentiment/LIWC + intention detection for Rhetoric. Rules or few-shot LLM prompts are fine so long as they output **typed nodes/edges** you can inspect. |\n| **5. Reality conformity** | Correct: you’re tracking both **assertive claims** (word → world) and **directive/performative moves** (world → word). Those align with your “question taxonomy” (What-is? Why? How? What-for? etc.) and eventually with update loops (“did reality now match the directive?”). |\n\n---\n\n## Five new questions to clarify the remaining “missing pieces”\n\n1. **Evaluation & Ground-Truth**  \n   *How will you decide the system is “working”?*  \n   Possible metrics: coverage of lenses, accuracy of node typing, usefulness ratings from you/peers, ability to surface non-obvious tensions that later prove insightful.\n\n2. **Granularity & Scope Control**  \n   *At what resolution should the graph stop?*  \n   Sentence-level? Clause-level? Full argument schemas? A disciplined grain prevents combinatorial explosion.\n\n3. **Canonical Data Model vs. Extensible Schemas**  \n   Should there be a **fixed core ontology** (e.g., `Experience`, `ValueConflict`, `Practice`, `Virtue`, `Intention`) with lens-specific extensions, or do you want a **fully polymorphic schema** where each lens can add its own classes? Deciding now avoids migrations later.\n\n4. **Human-in-the-Loop Workflow**  \n   Where do **you** or other curators step in?  \n   • Approve or correct auto-extracted triples?  \n   • Author “garden notes” that override LLM guesses?  \n   • Set priority tags for which tensions to explore next?\n\n5. **Inter-subjective & Ethical Dimensions**  \n   If multiple people share graphs, how do you:  \n   • Represent *conflicting* truth-claims without flattening them?  \n   • Handle sensitive or sacred material (e.g., spiritual experiences)?  \n   • Provide provenance so each statement can be traced back to its author and context?\n\nAnswering these will sharpen the blueprint and help pick the right first implementation slice (e.g., start with automated Grammar extraction + manual Logic/Rhetoric tagging on a single diary entry).\n\n---\n\nLet me know how these land, or tweak any that feel off-target, and we’ll iterate from there.",

      "content": "Yeah, the system is working when I feel like when I talk to it for a while or send it my previous conversation history, I see that it kind of is building up, you know, all the different ideas that I've shared and domains and sort of clustering them and to maybe a few hierarchies of like, okay, so when I'm talking about this conversation around and making useful my chat histories, there's like a general idea about knowledge management, right? And then it would keep in the record the chat digester idea and then maybe the goals and then maybe the different ways that we've described doing it in maybe some formal processes or approaches. And then, you know, like, I want to see these things because right now I don't even remember what I explored. Yeah, I don't think we need the sentence level unless it's saving one as an example of evidence of why it chose a certain facet or feature. A disciplined grain prevents combinatorial explosion for granularity. I'm not sure, what do you think? Like, clause level arguments? I guess arguments can be generated later from clauses. And so maybe we don't need to make that. Core ontology. I'm not sure, how is value conflict an element of ontology? Practice, virtue, intention, experience. I'm not sure what these are and how they relate to ontologies. But yeah, I have a feeling, like, I have my own intuitions of things that are going to be meaningful in the system that we want to be extracting. Like, first of all, just general concepts, right? Like, and I don't know if the ontology is going to be entity attributes and relationship. Entity is like the named thing and all that. But like, that sounds like a pretty basic core for things. And I'm not sure what the history of the research is on what that that core can be that can then be expanded upon. But yeah. Okay. And yeah, you know, I wouldn't mind being in the loop for extracting and approving things. But I would rather do it in a way that I could just talk back like I am now I can be popping something up and send me a message and say, okay, so we found this and here's what we think. And this is the context it was within. And, you know, do you have anything to say about this? And which one's more important for you? And maybe something about attention or something that matters or like, why did why are you thinking about this or talking about this? Because somehow, like, who cares if I just gather all the concepts that I've ever talked about? I think there's something about it mattering or like, maybe each of these conversations also represent something that I might have left hanging or like a to do, right? And so I think there's something about like, yeah. The things that are showing up in our life, our actions, our to dos and to becomes and ways of being and attention, I think are really core to some of this stuff. Because ethics is either action or inaction and how we spend our time. Yeah, how do we represent conflicting truth claims without flattening them? Well, we got to show how and why they make sense in the person's worldview. I mean, no, very few people are actually insane. They just have different beliefs and maybe false beliefs about things. And maybe even not just false beliefs, but like, beliefs based on different ontologies of what is real and what is knowable and maybe also limited information. And so demonstrating where that difference lies, rather than calling one thing wrong and one thing right. And so that's why it's important to figure out like, what are the different dimensions where things can lie? It's important. Yeah, I'm not sure if we should start with grammar, logic, extraction and rhetoric and like, hopefully this is helpful and sensitive material. Fine, just handle it. Provide provenance. Yeah, that's the other thing. So provenance for each idea and then also iterations of ideas. I've talked with you about this particular idea at least 10 times. Yeah. Maybe logical philosophical skeleton of human thought. But Also, it's like I wanna make a A digester that digests my words And I guess represents me more fully with every conversation. So what is it? It's gonna represent my ideas, my beliefs, my, like, arguments, my tensions, Of course, gonna have missing things, but, like, the question isn't whether or not we use the trivium, but whether or not the trivium is the right tool. To start, like, there's You know, Linguistic utterances or speech actions. There's, like, the 5 y's and the one h, and then Plus 2 or 3 additional question types that kind of define What is knowledge or equipment? Like, what is in my mind? What am I learning over time? So there's, like, attention There's things that if I'm meaningful, my values I like Joe Edelman's, like, sources of meaning because there's some things that I attend to and focus on that are just No. What I think are constitutive of a good life and then some things that I pay attention to because I want to get My and then there's, like, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and there's a lot of different frameworks. So what do we digest from the conversations that we're having? To update a database or a graph or a few Small Things. Over time. That in aggregate will be able to be the source for things like a theory of mind that pulls from there. Right? Or a, question about my any other framework. Right? It should be able to be derived from this mind that kind of represents me in a more full and robust and comprehensive way that is digested from what we can find in the text until Penny Baker shows what's possible. But I want to show what's possible and formalize it into more structured, approaches, potentially using ontologies And graph. Relationships. So there's, like, objects and concepts. And arguments and logic and ideas and inspiration and a lot of things. And I'm wondering, like, who researches this? What are we talking about necessarily? And 1, do they research as? Formal, like, definition of what I'm trying to describe. Like, is it the trivium? Is it is it, like, because there's, like, sources of meaning, and concepts, clusters, is it, like, You know, God al Asher Bak. We're all ideas are just analogies and thesis, antithesis, tensions, like, what is it stored in my mind? And I have a feeling that there's a new relationship between how I store it and how we compare like, things coming in and getting encoded into the system and what is being encoded and shown compared across systems.",

      "content": "Below is a concrete **first-cut blueprint** that folds the points you just raised into an implementable v 0.1.  I highlight the choices you still need to make and flag the most relevant research niches so you can see who’s already working on each slice.\n\n---\n\n## 1 . Granularity → **“Idea chunks + evidence pointers”**\n\n* **Storage unit = Idea Chunk**  \n  *Roughly a paragraph or coherent turn in chat.*  \n  Each chunk becomes one **`Statement`** node whose text is stored verbatim.  \n* **Evidence pointer**: a `HAS_SOURCE_SENTENCE` edge back to the **exact sentence** (kept only for provenance, not exploded into the main graph).  \n* **Benefit** – keeps the core graph small while letting you drill down for justification when you’re reviewing an extraction. citeturn0search1turn0search0\n\n---\n\n## 2 . Core ontology → **E-A-R spine + PROV-O for meta-data**\n\n| Layer | Purpose | Key classes / properties |\n|-------|---------|--------------------------|\n| **Spine (Entity-Attribute-Relation)** | Carries “what you talked about.” | `Concept`, `Person`, `Project`, `Goal`, `Value`, `Belief`, `Task`, `Question`, `Experience` |\n| **Linguistic layer** | Connects raw words → ideas. | `Statement` (holds the chunk) → `MENTIONS` → any spine node |\n| **Conflict layer** | Records tensions without collapsing them. | `SUPPORTS`, `CONTRADICTS`, `REFINES`, `UNRESOLVED_WITH` |\n| **Provenance layer (W3C PROV-O)** | Who said what, when, in which lens. | `wasAttributedTo`, `generatedAtTime`, `wasDerivedFrom`, `hadPrimarySource` |\n\nUsing PROV-O saves you reinventing trust & traceability; recent work shows it mates cleanly with domain ontologies and even BFO if you ever need stricter upper-level semantics. citeturn0search4turn0search9\n\n---\n\n## 3 . Extraction pipeline (minimal viable)\n\n1. **Chunker** – splits long chats into idea-sized turns.  \n2. **Grammar pass** – NER + “concept spotting” (noun-phrase → `Concept`).  \n3. **Logic pass** – Argument-component tagging (claim, premise, counter-premise) using the 2024 ArgMining models; edges become `SUPPORTS`/`CONTRADICTS`. citeturn0search1  \n4. **Rhetoric pass** – LIWC-style motive & sentiment tags; maps to `Value` or `Goal`.  \n5. **Lens annotator** – A rule set that marks each statement with the lens(es) it naturally fits (Edelman, Taylor, etc.) so you can slice the same graph multiple ways.  \n\nEverything above can be prototyped with off-the-shelf Python + spaCy/transformers, then written into Neo4j or TerminusDB.\n\n---\n\n## 4 . Surfacing the “important stuff”\n\n| Signal | How to compute | UI cue |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **Attention weight** | Recency × frequency × explicit *“this matters”* tags you drop while chatting. | Spotlight panel |\n| **Open loops / “to-dos”** | `Task` nodes whose `STATUS`≠“done”. | Inbox-style list |\n| **High-energy tensions** | Pairs of `Concept` nodes with dense `CONTRADICTS` edges and no `RESOLVED_BY`. | “Tension garden” view |\n| **New clusters** | Community-detection on `Concept` subgraph; clusters with > N new nodes since last run. | Change feed |\n\n---\n\n## 5 . Human-in-the-loop touchpoints\n\n1. **Daily digest**: bot sends you uncertain extractions (“We weren’t sure if *intentional fatherhood* is a `Value` or a `Goal`. Thoughts?”).  \n2. **One-click triage**: you reply inline; system updates edges & re-weights confidence.  \n3. **Periodic pruning**: every few weeks you get a heat-map of low-connectivity nodes – quick way to delete stale notions.\n\n---\n\n## 6 . Path to a public, multi-worldview garden\n\n* **Worldview subgraphs**: tag every statement with an `asserted_by` agent; conflicting claims live side-by-side, linked by `CONTRADICTS`, not overwritten.  \n* **Lens overlays**: generate read-only “views” (e.g., *Buddhist Lens View* filters for statements tagged Buddhist OR mentions of compassion/attachment).  \n* **Ethics & privacy**: sensitive statements inherit a `VISIBILITY` flag; downstream views respect it automatically.\n\n---\n\n## 7 . Where to look in the literature\n\n| Slice | Active communities / 2024-25 references |\n|-------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Personal KGs & PKM | Survey of PKG ecosystems (Balog 2024) citeturn0search0 |\n| Argument mining | ACL ArgMining workshop series (2024 proceedings) citeturn0search6 |\n| Ontology engineering | W3C PROV-O, BFO cross-maps citeturn0search9 |\n| Semantic engines / KG ↔ ML | “How Knowledge Graphs Transform ML in 2025” citeturn0search2 |\n| PKM tooling inspirations | PKM app landscape 2025 (Obsidian, AFFiNE, …) citeturn0search3turn0search8 |\n\nThese papers & tools show working code and evaluation methods you can borrow rather than invent.\n\n---\n\n## 8 . Decisions still on your desk\n\n1. **Exact class list for the spine** – is `Belief` separate from `Concept`?  \n2. **Confidence-threshold rules** – when does a low-certainty extraction ask for your input vs. go straight into the graph?  \n3. **Lens tagging heuristics** – start with keywords or embed-similarity?  \n4. **Visualization style you’ll actually open** – force-directed graph, hierarchical tree, or plain tables?  \n5. **Deployment footprint** – local Neo4j vs. serverless graph store.\n\n---\n\n### Next small step\n\nIf you give me:\n\n* **One real chat transcript** (≈500 words) and  \n* **Which lenses you want tagged first**  \n\n…I can walk you through chunk-level extraction and show you the first graph slice so we can iterate on class names and review workflow before scaling up.\n\nHow does that sound?",
