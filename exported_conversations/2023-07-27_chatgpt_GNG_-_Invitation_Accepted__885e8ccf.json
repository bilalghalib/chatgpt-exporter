I vividly recall the profound connections and meaningful discussions we shared in Dharamsala last fall, and I am delighted to have an opportunity to recreate that environment.\n\nWith immense excitement, I'm writing to confirm that I will be able to join you and our collective group of 'good humans' for the long weekend in January at the 1440 Multiversity. It's a privilege to be included in such a curated list of individuals, and I am eager to participate in the conversation, poetry, and community building.\n\nI appreciate your generous offer to cover the cost of lodging, meals, and potentially transportation. Please consider me in for arranging my own travel to Santa Cruz. If I need any support or assistance, I'll reach out promptly.\n\nI am looking forward to receiving more details in the fall and am already counting down the days until we reconvene in the Redwoods. Until then, sending love back your way with gratitude for your invitation and for the work you do in cultivating such valuable and life-giving communities.\n\nTake care and all the best,\n\n[Your Name]",

It takes me back to those transcendent moments of 2018, before so many things unfolded, and the sacred atmosphere that such heartfelt companionship and stunning surroundings revealed.\n\nBy the end of October, God willing, I will be stepping into the exciting journey of fatherhood for the first time. Josephine, my wonderful partner, has kindly encouraged me to attend the gathering without her. My initial thought was to see if we could bring along my niece as a babysitter, thus transforming this event into a family trip! Josephine playfully suggested that my enthusiasm might be taking flight a bit too much.\n\nBeing a newcomer to the world of parenting, I'm not exactly certain how to navigate this terrain. I wonder, are there any parents in this thread who could share their wisdom? Would it be utterly absurd to consider bringing a 2-month-old infant on a trip like this?\n\nIn any case, please count me in as deeply interested! If you are inclined towards prayer, I would appreciate your intentions for the materialization of some new grants before January. Otherwise, I may need to humbly request assistance with the airfare. \n\nCan't wait to join you all in the Redwoods and create new memories!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
