      "content": "Here’s a simple, reliable recipe for **fluffy white flour pancakes**—the classic diner-style kind, light and golden with a soft, airy interior.\n\n---\n\n### 🥞 Fluffy White Flour Pancakes\n\n#### **Ingredients (makes about 8–10 pancakes):**\n- 1 ½ cups (190g) **all-purpose flour**\n- 2 tablespoons **sugar**\n- 1 tablespoon **baking powder**\n- ½ teaspoon **salt**\n- 1 ¼ cups (300ml) **milk** (whole milk preferred)\n- 1 **egg**\n- 3 tablespoons **butter**, melted (plus more for cooking)\n- 1 teaspoon **vanilla extract** (optional, but adds depth)\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions:**\n\n1. **Mix Dry Ingredients**  \n   In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n\n2. **Mix Wet Ingredients**  \n   In a separate bowl or measuring cup, beat the egg, then whisk in the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract if using.\n\n3. **Combine Wet and Dry**  \n   Pour the wet mixture into the dry. Gently mix with a whisk or spatula just until combined.  \n   **Do not overmix**—a few lumps are okay. Overmixing will make the pancakes tough.\n\n4. **Let the Batter Rest (Optional but Ideal)**  \n   Let the batter sit for 5–10 minutes. This allows the baking powder to activate and hydrate the flour for extra fluffiness.\n\n5. **Cook the Pancakes**  \n   Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.  \n   Pour ¼ cup of batter per pancake. Cook until bubbles form and edges look set (about 2 minutes), then flip and cook another 1–2 minutes until golden brown.\n\n6. **Serve Warm**  \n   Serve with butter, syrup, or your favorite toppings.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 Tips for Extra Fluffiness:\n- **Don’t overmix** the batter—gentle mixing keeps air bubbles.\n- **Resting the batter** really helps.\n- **Use fresh baking powder** for maximum rise.\n- **Room temperature ingredients** help the batter mix more evenly.\n\n---\n\nWant to make them **extra indulgent** or **healthier**? I can suggest tweaks too—like folding in whipped egg whites, adding yogurt, or subbing part of the milk for buttermilk.",
