For each example:\n\nBefore: The original text as you had it.\nAfter: Revised text that weaves in references to sustainability (drawn from GreenComp).\nWhy & How: An explanation of which GreenComp qualities the change addresses (e.g., Valuing Sustainability, Supporting Fairness, Systems Thinking, etc.) and the reasoning behind the edits.\nTip: You can apply this same approach to all slides—these four are simply illustrative examples.\n\n1) SLIDE: WHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY FOR ENTREPRENEURS?\nBefore\nWHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY FOR ENTREPRENEURS?\n\nDecisiveness\nConfidence\nResilience\nHumility\n5 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: What mindsets are necessary for entrepreneurs? Why?\n- Decisiveness, confidence, resilience, humility, etc.\nRecap: An entrepreneurial mindset is a way of thinking that enables you to overcome challenges, be decisive, and accept responsibility for your outcomes. Anyone willing to do the work can develop an entrepreneurial mindset.\n\nAfter\nWHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY FOR ENTREPRENEURS?\n\nDecisiveness\nConfidence\nFairness\nResilience\nHumility\n5 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: What mindsets are necessary for entrepreneurs? Why?\n\nDecisiveness: Make timely decisions, even with limited information.\nConfidence: Trust in your ability to figure things out.\nFairness: Recognize that your decisions can impact customers, teams, and the environment. Strive for equity and justice in how you operate.\nResilience: Embrace mistakes; they’re learning opportunities.\nHumility: Stay open to feedback and new perspectives.\nRecap: An entrepreneurial mindset helps you overcome challenges and accept accountability for your outcomes. It also includes supporting fairness—an awareness that your business decisions today have ripple effects on partners, future customers, and even wider communities.\n\nWhy & How We Changed It\nWhy: We wanted to subtly introduce the GreenComp idea of Supporting Fairness (1.2) in the list of core entrepreneurial mindsets. Entrepreneurs often think about profit; here, we insert the notion that fairness and justice are also central.\nHow: We added a bullet named “Fairness,” mentioning how decisions affect people and communities, aligning with GreenComp’s emphasis on intergenerational justice and equity.\n2) SLIDE: HOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?\nBefore\nHOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?\n(5 minutes: Brainstorm)\nAsk: How do you develop a growth mindset? What are actions you can take right now?\n\nBe aware of limiting behaviors (“I can’t,” “I don’t have enough,” “I’ll never…”).\nPractice self-encouragement.\nChallenge yourself to try new approaches.\nAfter\nHOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?\n(5 minutes: Brainstorm)\nAsk: How do you develop a growth mindset? What are actions you can take right now?\n\nRecognize limiting beliefs: (“I can’t,” “I don’t have enough,” “There’s no opportunity here”).\nShift from scarcity to possibility: Instead of “We’ll run out of resources,” consider “How can we adapt or create solutions that respect those limits and still grow?”\nPractice self-encouragement: Celebrate progress, not just outcomes.\nTry new approaches: Adopt exploratory thinking—test small experiments, learn quickly, and iterate.\nReflect on impact: Ask, “How do my decisions affect the community, the environment, or future opportunities?”\nWhy & How We Changed It\nWhy: Growth mindset closely relates to GreenComp’s Envisioning Sustainable Futures (Area 3), specifically Exploratory Thinking (3.3). Entrepreneurs who adopt a growth mindset often experiment with new ideas.\nHow: We replaced generic statements with references to “shifting from scarcity to possibility,” linking to futures literacy and adaptability. We also added a question about impact on community/environment, evoking a subtle sustainability lens without overshadowing the core mindset topic.\n3) SLIDE: PROCESS-FOCUSED (“Success is a journey…”)\nBefore\nPROCESS-FOCUSED\n“Success is a journey, not a destination.” – Arthur Ashe\n(Lecture: 3 minutes)\n\nFocusing too heavily on the outcome can lead to fear of failure.\nGrowth mindset individuals see effort and practice as crucial.\nCelebrate small wins along the way.\nAfter\nPROCESS-FOCUSED\n“Success is a journey, not a destination.” – Arthur Ashe\n(Lecture: 3 minutes)\n\nFocusing only on the end can create pressure and fear of failure.\nProcess includes consistent learning, refining ideas, and noticing how each choice affects your team, your customers, and—even in small ways—your broader environment.\nPeople with a growth mindset value continuous improvement. They pivot when things don’t work and adapt their approach.\nCelebrate small wins. Recognize that small positive changes can add up—like improving workflow efficiency or finding new ways to reduce waste.\nWhy & How We Changed It\nWhy: GreenComp advocates a process-focused view of sustainability problems, acknowledging that systems are complex and solutions evolve. Linking “process” to small day-to-day decisions subtly brings in Systems Thinking (2.1).\nHow: We inserted a reference to how each choice “affects your team, your customers, and your broader environment,” which quietly nudges participants to reflect on broader impacts (a systems perspective) without making it the sole focus.\n4) SLIDE: HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE! (Vision Board Activity)\nBefore\nHOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE!\n(40 minutes: Activity)\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\nLet’s not make a list of to-dos, but define who we want to be. Values guide us more consistently than mere goals. Let’s create a Vision Board to identify what matters.\n\n25 minutes: Activity\n\nIndividual work: Use flipcharts or PowerPoint to illustrate your vision and goals.\n10 minutes: Share\n\nAfter\nHOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE!\n(40 minutes: Activity)\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\n\nInstead of just listing tasks, define who you want to be. Values are like a compass guiding both personal and business decisions.\nEntrepreneurs who align actions with their core beliefs often discover unique ways to serve customers, support local communities, or even reduce waste—aligning with Valuing Sustainability (1.1).\nLet’s create a Vision Board that reflects the kind of entrepreneur you want to become, and how you want your venture to impact the world.\n25 minutes: Activity\n\nIndividual work: On flipcharts, slides, or a video, map out your vision and goals. Include not just business milestones but also ways you want to be fair, resourceful, or mindful of social/environmental impacts.\n10 minutes: Share\n\nShow your Vision Board if you like. Notice if your brand, mission, and actions all align. Sometimes entrepreneurs discover they care about sustainability or social fairness and can incorporate that into their next steps.\nWhy & How We Changed It\nWhy: Vision Board is the perfect moment to integrate Valuing Sustainability (1.1) and possibly Acting for Sustainability (Area 4) because you’re talking about identity and future goals.\nHow: We explicitly mention “discover unique ways to serve customers, support local communities, or reduce waste,” so participants see that accountability can include ethical or ecological considerations. It’s still optional and not forced, but gently introduced.\nFinal Thoughts\nThis “before and after” approach shows exactly what changed and why it’s valuable to weave GreenComp qualities—like supporting fairness, systems thinking, exploratory thinking, and valuing sustainability—into standard entrepreneurial mindset topics.\n\nBefore: Traditional slides focusing mainly on internal success factors.\nAfter: Slides subtly emphasize long-term thinking, fairness, broader impact, and the notion that entrepreneurial resilience + sustainability can go hand in hand.\nUse these examples as a template to update the rest of your slides, always asking:\n\nWhich GreenComp competence can enhance this slide’s theme?\nHow can I mention sustainability ideas naturally without overshadowing core entrepreneurial content?\nThat way, you’ll organically introduce sustainability mindset elements into your workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan we find an alignment between sustainability mindsets in the GreenComp and entrepreneurial mindsets and can we make a single slide that shows the synergies ? you can find the entrecomp competencies here: [[[ Entrepreneurship as a competence\nThe EntreComp study was launched to establish a common reference framework for\nentrepreneurship as a competence to help citizens to develop their ability to actively\nparticipate in society, to manage their own lives and careers and to start value-creating\ninitiatives. The conceptualisation of entrepreneurship as a competence was therefore the\nstepping stone for the development of a reference framework.\nIn the context of the EntreComp study, entrepreneurship is understood as a transversal\nkey competence applicable by individuals and groups, including existing organisations,\nacross all spheres of life. It is defined as follows:\nEntrepreneurship is when you act upon opportunities and ideas and\ntransform them into value for others. The value that is created can be\nfinancial, cultural, or social (FFE-YE, 2012).\nThis definition focuses on value creation, no matter what type of value or context. It\ncovers value creation in any domain and possible value chain. It refers to value creation\nin the private, public and third sectors and in any hybrid combination of the three. It\nthus embraces different types of entrepreneurship, including intrapreneurship, social\nentrepreneurship, green entrepreneurship and digital entrepreneurship.\nEntrepreneurship as a competence applies to all spheres of life. It enables citizens to\nnurture their personal development, to actively contribute to social development,\nto enter the job market as employee or as self-employed, and to start-up or scale-up\nventures which may have a cultural, social or commercial motive.\nThe EntreComp conceptual model is made up of two main dimensions: the 3 compe-\ntence areas that directly mirror the definition of entrepreneurship as the ability to turn\nideas into action that generate value for someone other than oneself; and the 15 com-\npetences that, together, make up the building blocks of the entrepreneurship as a\ncompetence for all citizens. We have listed the competences in Table 1. Each one is\naccompanied by a hint or an exhortation to the learner to put the competence into\npractice and a descriptor, which breaks it down into its core aspects.\n‘Ideas and opportunities’\n,\n‘Resources’ and ‘Into Action’ are the 3 areas of the conceptual\nmodel and they have been labelled to stress entrepreneurship competence as the ability\nto transform ideas and opportunities into action by mobilising resources. These resources\ncan be personal (namely, self-awareness and self-efficacy, motivation and persever-\nance), material (for instance, production means and financial resources) or non-material\n(for instance, specific knowledge, skills and attitudes). The 3 competence areas are\ntightly intertwined: entrepreneurship as a competence stands above all three of these\ntogether. The 15 competences are also interrelated and interconnected and should be\ntreated as parts of a whole. We are not suggesting that the learner should acquire the\nhighest level of proficiency in all 15 competences, or have the same proficiency across all\nthe competences. The framework does, however, imply that entrepreneurship as a com-\npetence is made up of 15 building blocks.\nFigure 2 depicts the EntreComp competences as slices of a pie chart. Each slice has a\ndifferent colour: blue for the competences in the ‘Ideas and opportunities’ area, orange\nfor those in the ‘Resources’ area and green for the competences in the ‘Into action’ area.\nThe slices are surrounded by the three competence rings, which embrace all the 15\ncompetences. This representation underlines that the coupling between competence\nareas and competences does not have taxonomic rigour. For example, creativity is pre-\nsented as one of the competences in the ‘Ideas and opportunities’ area, even though the\ncreative process entails both the use of resources and the capacity to act upon ideas to\nmould their value. The reader is welcome to establish new links among areas and com-\npetences to expand the elements of the framework and adapt them to best fit his/her\nfocus.\n10\nFigure 2: Areas and competences of the EntreComp conceptual model.\nTable 1 provides an overview of the EntreComp conceptual model, showing how the\nentrepreneurship competence has been broken down into its constituent parts within the\nframework. Competences are numbered for ease of reference – the order in which they\nare presented does not imply a sequence in the acquisition process or a hierarchy: no\none element comes first, and none of them is more important than the others. There are\nno core competences and enabling competences in the EntreComp conceptualization.\nDepending on the context of take-up, it is reasonable to expect that more emphasis may\nbe put on some of the competences and less on others, or else that competences are\nstreamlined to mirror an entrepreneurial process created to foster learning through\nentrepreneurship. In other words, the EntreComp Framework can be seen as a starting\npoint for the interpretation of the entrepreneurship competence, which over time will be\nfurther elaborated and refined to address the particular needs of specific target groups.\n11\nTable 1: EntreComp conceptual model\nAreas Competences Hints Descriptors\n1.1 Spotting\nopportunities\nUse your5 imagi-\nnation and abili-\nties to identify\nopportunities for\ncreating value\n Identify and seize opportunities to create value by\nexploring the social, cultural and economic land-\nscape\n Identify needs and challenges that need to be met\n Establish new connections and bring together\nscattered elements of the landscape to create op-\nportunities to create value\n1.

The EntreComp Framework\nThis chapter presents the EntreComp Framework progression model and the key charac-\nteristics of the learning outcomes that have been based on it.\nThe stakeholders involved in the review of the EntreComp regard it as a very compre-\nhensive and broad-based tool with 3 competence areas, 15 competences, 15 de-\nscriptors, 8 proficiency levels and 442 learning outcomes (see Appendix). They\nacknowledge that the EntreComp Framework (i) reflects the complexity of the entrepre-\nneurship competence domain, which touches upon several aspects of our everyday lives,\nand (ii) can be used as a multi-purpose reference guide. The advantage of having a\nbroad yet comprehensive competence framework is that although it can accommodate\nbespoke customisations, it also allows initiatives that tackle entrepreneurship as a com-\npetence to be compared, facilitating a common understanding of what being entrepre-\nneurial means.\nThe comprehensiveness of EntreComp is one of its main assets. However, the reader\nshould bear in mind that not all citizens, learners, or users will be interested in\ndeveloping all the competences here described to the highest level of proficien-\ncy. It is expected that institutions, intermediaries and initiative developers who are\nwilling to adopt EntreComp as a reference framework adapt it to their own purposes and\nto the needs of the user group they intend to target. In other words, the EntreComp\nframework presented in this report should be considered as a starting point. It must be\ntailored to the context of use in order to be implemented (see also below, in Section\n3.2).\n3.1 Progression Model\nEntrepreneurship as a competence is developed through action by individuals or collec-\ntive entities to create value for others.\nThe progression in entrepreneurial learning is made up of two aspects:\n1. Developing increasing autonomy and responsibility in acting upon ideas and op-\nportunities to create value;\n2. Developing the capacity to generate value from simple and predictable contexts\nup to complex, constantly changing environments.\nThe EntreComp Progression Model does not lay down a linear sequence of steps that\nevery citizen must take to become proficiently entrepreneurial or to start-up a venture.\nInstead, it shows that the boundaries of individual and collective entrepreneurial compe-\ntences can be pushed forward, to achieve greater and greater impact through value\ncreating endeavours.\nThe EntreComp Progression Model provides a reference for the development of proficien-\ncy starting from value creation achieved through external support, up to transformative\nvalue creation. It consists of four main levels: Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced and\nExpert. Each level is in turn split into two sub-levels, as illustrated in Table 2. At Founda-\ntion level, entrepreneurial value is created with external support. At Intermediate level,\nentrepreneurial value is created with increasing autonomy. At Advanced level, responsi-\nbility to transform ideas into action is developed. At Expert level, the value created has\nconsiderable impact in its reference domain.\nThese proficiency levels provide a way for the reader to look at the learning outcomes.\nFor instance, the first learning outcome of the 8th proficiency levels is: I can spot and\nquickly take advantage of an opportunity. Although ‘spotting and taking advantage of\nopportunity’ is a skill that learners start developing at lower levels, level 8 emphasises\nthe need to do it ‘quickly’. At this expert level, timeliness in making use of a window of\nopportunity has a strategic importance which can lead to high growth, breakthrough\ninnovation or radical transformation.\nThe EntreComp aims to be comprehensive and to offer a tool that can be adapted to\ndifferent needs. It is not prescriptive and it does not suggest that all learners should\n14\nacquire the highest level of proficiency in the competences, or that they should reach the\nsame proficiency across all the competences. For example, we could imagine designing\nan entrepreneurial learning experience targeted at the employees of the shoe-making\ndistrict of our region. In our programme we could, for instance, aim at an advanced level\nof proficiency in competences like ‘spotting opportunities’\n‘vision’\n,\n,\n‘mobilizing resources’\n,\n‘mobilising others’ and ‘planning and organising’\n. At the same time, we could aim to\nachieve an intermediate level of proficiency in ‘financial and economic literacy’. We could\ndeem it important to provide our learners with the skills to understand the financial\nviability of their ideas, but not important to have them develop double-entry bookkeep-\ning skills, which would require and advanced level of proficiency.\nWe remind the reader that entrepreneurial value creation and entrepreneurial learning\ncan take place in any sphere of life. The EntreComp Progression Model does not refer to\nany specific setting, especially not to formal education settings. By focusing on the de-\nvelopment of competences through the actual creation of entrepreneurial value, the\nprogression model breaks down the boundaries between education, work and civic en-\ngagement. In this respect, the EntreComp Progression Model is transversal to formal,\nnon-formal and informal learning contexts.\n15\nTable 2: EntreComp Progression model\nFoundation Intermediate Advanced Relying on support6 from others Building independence Taking responsibility Under direct super-\nvision.\nWith reduced\nsupport from\nothers, some\nOn my own and\ntogether with my\npeers.\nTaking and\nsharing some\nresponsibilities.\nWith some guidance\nand together with\nothers.\nTaking responsi-\nbility for making\ndecisions and\nautonomy and\ntogether with my\npeers.\nworking with\nothers.\nDiscover Explore Experiment Dare Improve Reinforce Level 1 focuses\nLevel 2 focuses\nLevel 3 focuses on\nLevel 4 focuses\nLevel 5 focuses on\nLevel 6 focuses\nmainly on discover-\ning your qualities,\npotential, interests\nand wishes.

These statements can be designed\nand used for educational planning and curriculum development or for different types of\naccountability such as legal or professional accountability (Prøitz, 2010).\nEntrepreneurial learning can hardly be reduced to fixed pre-specified statements of\nlearning outcomes since it deals with the creation of value that does not exist prior to\nthe entrepreneurial learning process and cannot be foreseen in abstraction.\nHowever, learning outcome statements are considered as crucial to make the framework\nactionable. EntreComp learning outcomes have been developed as references for differ-\nent purposes. They could be used in the formal education and training sector for curricu-\nla design. In a non-formal learning context, they could be used to inspire the creation of\nprogrammes which aim to foster intrapreneurship within existing organisations. They\ncould also be used to guide the definition of tailored pedagogies, assessment methods,\nand learning environments that foster effective entrepreneurial learning.\nThus, EntreComp learning outcomes should not be taken as normative statements to be\ndirectly transposed into actual learning activities, or be used to measure student perfor-\nmance. They are a basis for the development of specific learning outcomes that are fit\nfor the specific context and a basis for the development of performance indicators.\nAlthough the vast majority of learning outcomes have been formulated as ‘I’ statements,\nthis does not mean that Entrepreneurship Competence only refers to the capacity of\nindividuals. On the contrary, the subject of entrepreneurial learning and behaviour can\nbe a group, like a project team, a non-profit organisation, a company, a public body or a\ncivil society movement.\nEntreComp learning outcomes are presented in the Appendix. Though comprehensive,\nthe list of learning outcomes is not exhaustive as it aims to suggest transversal applica-\nbility across educational contexts and application sectors.\n3.3 The EntreComp Framework at a glance: the overview table\nThe EntreComp overview table depicts the 3 areas and all the 15 competences, but\ndevelops them only on the three levels of proficiency that apply to all citizens: the foun-\ndation, intermediate and advanced levels.

The idea is to highlight a few key parallels and show how developing sustainability mindsets actually benefits business and entrepreneurship. At the end, you’ll find sample slide text that you can copy and paste (or adapt) directly.\n\nSTEP 1: Identify 2-3 Key Mindset Synergies\nBecause you don’t want to overwhelm participants, choose a small number of high-impact GreenComp and EntreComp competences that naturally align, for example:\n\nValuing Sustainability (GreenComp 1.1) and\nEthical & Sustainable Thinking (EntreComp 1.5)\n\nWhy? Both emphasize weighing the long-term social, cultural, and environmental impacts of decisions.\nSystems Thinking (GreenComp 2.1) and\nSpotting Opportunities (EntreComp 1.1)\n\nWhy? Both require seeing the “big picture,” scanning for market openings or solutions across interconnected social/environmental systems.\nAdaptability (GreenComp 3.2) and\nCoping With Uncertainty, Ambiguity and Risk (EntreComp 3.3)\n\nWhy? Both focus on thriving amid change. Entrepreneurs need to pivot quickly to meet shifting demands; sustainability-minded entrepreneurs also adapt to new environmental or social constraints.\n(You can pick whichever synergy resonates best with your workshop focus.)\n\nSTEP 2: Create a Single “Synergy Slide” (Optional Variation: Two Slides)\nUse one slide for a quick synergy overview, or two slides if you want more room for brief examples and bullet points.\n\nSlide Title Suggestion\n“GreenComp & EntreComp: Building Sustainable Entrepreneurial Mindsets”\n\nSlide Structure\nIntro Sentence: A brief statement on why it’s valuable to combine sustainability-oriented thinking (GreenComp) with entrepreneurial competencies (EntreComp).\nTable or Bullets: Display 2-3 synergy points (see examples above). For each synergy pair, have a short explanation (1-2 lines) connecting how the two competencies reinforce each other.\nBenefits: End with a quick bullet or two on why this synergy helps entrepreneurs succeed (e.g., “enhances brand credibility,” “manages risk better,” “aligns with consumer demand for responsible products,” etc.).\nSTEP 3: Provide a Concrete “Why It Helps Business” Rationale\nExplain briefly that sustainability-minded entrepreneurs:\n\nOften see new opportunities first (e.g., green markets, ethical consumer segments).\nBuild resilience (less likely to be blindsided by regulatory or resource changes).\nAttract employee and customer loyalty by demonstrating purpose and fairness.\nSAMPLE SLIDE CONTENT\nBelow is a single-slide example with synergy points. Adapt the text and format to your style and branding:\n\nSlide: “GreenComp & EntreComp: Building Sustainable Entrepreneurial Mindsets”\nGreenComp & EntreComp – A Powerful Mix\n\nValuing Sustainability (GC 1.1) + Ethical & Sustainable Thinking (EC 1.5)\n- Both emphasize long-term impacts on people and planet.\n- Entrepreneurs who adopt these mindsets weigh the social/environmental consequences of their ideas from day one, leading to more trustworthy brands and responsible innovation.\n\nSystems Thinking (GC 2.1) + Spotting Opportunities (EC 1.1)\n- Both require seeing the “big picture.”\n- Entrepreneurs scan markets for new opportunities, while also recognizing interconnected environmental or social factors. This broader lens can reveal hidden niches or unmet needs.\n\nAdaptability (GC 3.2) + Coping With Uncertainty (EC 3.3)\n- Both focus on navigating change and ambiguity.\n- By staying flexible and open-minded—especially in rapidly shifting global contexts—entrepreneurs can pivot, innovate, and thrive under pressure.\n\nWhy Does It Matter for Business?\n\nReduced Risks: Anticipate regulation changes or resource constraints.\nCustomer Loyalty: Consumers increasingly value responsible brands.\nInnovation: Sustainability constraints often spark original ideas and solutions.\n“Aligning GreenComp and EntreComp mindsets helps entrepreneurs create viable businesses that not only succeed financially but also contribute to a healthier, more equitable future.”\n\nFinal Tips\nUse Real Examples: If you have time, mention a local startup or global brand that used a sustainability lens to spot a winning opportunity or build resilience.\nKeep It Brief: This synergy slide is a connector, not a complete lesson. A short bullet format often works best.\nRelate to Your Workshop Flow: Introduce this synergy either right after discussing entrepreneurial competencies or just before you delve into sustainability mindsets, so participants see the seamless connection.\nThis step-by-step approach—with an optional synergy slide—will help participants recognize that developing sustainability mindsets (per GreenComp) enhances entrepreneurial success (per EntreComp)."

How are you doing today? \nThe session today will be a bit lighter than the others. We want to make sure that we are not giving you too much work or overwhelming you before the pitch. Although this wont be a heavy session, we will cover very important points that all entrepreneurs should know about in this context we are operating in. \n\n\nUnderstand how having the proper mindset can increase the odds of entrepreneurial success.\n\nPractice fixed vs growth mindsets.\n\nLearn how to develop a growth mindset.\n\n\n\nWHAT ARE MINDSETS?\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nA mindset is a way of thinking—a belief that shapes how we see ourselves, others, and the world. Our beliefs determine our behaviors and drive our attitude toward daily challenges. \nEntrepreneurs often rely on mindsets that help them overcome obstacles and keep going in tough times. \nThe right mindset can have a huge positive impact on the people around you—customers, employees, and partners.\nOur goal for this session is to discuss a few that we believe in and want to work on. Entrepreneurs generally have these mindsets as they look to overcome obstacles.\n\nAsk: Why do mindsets matter?\nPotential answers:\nHaving a good mindset can keep you going when times are rough\nA good mindset can have a positive affect on others around you including employees and customers\nA growth mindset keeps you open to possibilities (e.g., new markets, new partnerships).\nMindsets play a role in determining your future. \nWhen you limit yourself in your mind, you will put up barriers for yourself. \nWhen you think you can do something and embrace possibilities, it is easier for you to push yourself, try new things, and conquer barriers.\nEtc…\n\nRecap: \nYour mindset plays a critical role in how you deal with challenges. \nPeople with a growth mindset tend to be more resilient and persevere despite setbacks—qualities that are crucial for entrepreneurs. \u000b\n\n\n\nHOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF?\nDo I believe in myself? \nDo I accept and welcome myself?\nDo I appreciate who I am?\nDo I respect, love, and support myself?\n\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nA good starting point to improve your interpersonal communication is to reflect on how you actually see and communicate with yourself. \n\nBe aware of what you’re saying to yourself. You might be surprised at just how often you put yourself down. The important piece of this step is to be non-judgmental. If you’re already calling yourself dumb, or saying you’ll never be able to accomplish a certain thing, or you aren’t the right person, how will anyone else believe that you are/can?! Judging yourself is the farthest thing from helpful.\nDo you believe in the product and your company?\nYou should! Why would you all be working so hard?!\nFacts are facts. You went to the market did research to find out what problems your customers were actually facing, and you designed and tested it for them! If this is true, the product isn’t the problem.\nIf you don’t believe in the product, that’s your first problem and you should work on that. \nDo you think that your company is good? Is there a place for it in this world?\nThink about all the good stuff you are planning and how you intend to expand! You should believe in the vision.\n\nThe number one thing that’s stops people from achieving their goals is themselves! So, the next big question is: \nDo you believe in yourself?\nThis is the one that stops people!\nYou can have the best product in the world, but we sabotage ourselves!\nWe are often focused on the challenges\n4\n\n“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.” \n\n-Christopher Robin, \nPooh’s Grand Adventure\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nYou are the only one putting limits on your capabilities. You are the only one who will stop yourself from succeeding. Five One Labs has accepted you into this incubator because WE BELIEVE in your product and your business and in YOU! You just have to believe in yourself. \n\n5\n\nWHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY \u000bFOR ENTREPRENEURS?\nDecisiveness\nConfidence\nResilience\nHumility\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What mindsets are necessary for entrepreneurs? Why?\nPotential answers:\nAllow entrepreneurs to share their thoughts freely, but make sure to touch on some of the points below as well!\nDecisiveness: To succeed as an entrepreneur, you must gain the ability to look at a problem or situation, digest all available data (at that point in time), and make a confident decision to move forward. Your ability as a decision-maker will make or break your future successes. In fact, at the opposite end, indecision is one of the greatest causes of business failure. When you can’t decide what to do, you delay taking action. In other words, you do nothing. Think about how many dreams (and businesses) failing to take action has killed.\nConfidence: It is essential that you get used to the uncomfortable feeling of knowing that you don't know what you’re doing, but you should act like you do! Whether it's getting on stage to speak, launching your product, or learning how to start a blog and publishing your ideas to the world, we tend to see others doing it and incorrectly assume they've always been good at it. They weren't born knowing how to speak confidently, launch successful products, or write excellent books. They also weren't born knowing how to become entrepreneurs. \nAccountability: The entrepreneurial mindset comes from taking responsibility for your actions and outcomes. From this moment forward, you must accept responsibility for everything in your life and hold yourself accountable to it. Sorry to tell you, but nobody cares how little time, money, or external support you have to accomplish your goals. Your circumstances may not be your fault, but they are your responsibility. All that matters is what you are doing RIGHT NOW to find your success. There are no more excuses. Accountability is required of entrepreneurs as well as successful employees. Stop passing the buck and blaming others. Hold yourself accountable – even when you aren’t to blame – and take action to fix the problem.\nResilience: As an entrepreneur, you will need to learn to deal with making mistakes and failing. They are inevitable and a part of your growth. If every misstep plummets you into self-doubt, you have to change the way you look at being wrong. This mindset shift takes resilience and is foundational to the entrepreneurial mindset. Success rarely happens in a straight line. Taking wrong turns and making mistakes is something that happens to everyone. Resilience isn’t only helpful when dealing with catastrophic mistakes. It’s a way to handle the small, simple decisions you’ve made that didn’t turn out right. “The only people who don’t make mistakes are the ones who don’t do anything.” \nHumility: Humility is freedom from pride or arrogance, and it ties all of the characteristics of entrepreneurship. Humility will keep you focused and centered (especially while being confident and decisive). Along with humility comes coachability — the ability to be coached. If you want to accomplish big things in life, you need to be willing to learn from others and nourish a growth mindset. To do big things, you need to grow. To grow, you need to learn. Thinking like an entrepreneur means seeking out mentors and coaches who have been where you are trying to go — and having the humility to accept their guidance.\nFairness: Recognize that your decisions can impact customers, teams, and the environment. Strive for equity and justice in how you operate.\nhttps://hacktheentrepreneur.com/entrepreneurial-mindset/\n\nRecap: An entrepreneurial mindset is a way of thinking that enables you to overcome challenges, be decisive, and accept responsibility for your outcomes. It is a constant need to improve your skills, learn from your mistakes, and take continuous action on your ideas. Anyone willing to do the work can develop an entrepreneurial mindset. \n\n6\n\nFIXED MINDSET\nGROWTH MINDSET\n“Failure is the limit of my abilities”\n“I give up easily”\n“My potential is predetermined”\n“My intelligence is static”\n“I avoid challenges”\n“I will never improve”\n“Failures offer opportunity”\n“I like to try new things”\n“I can learn to do what I want”\n“My intelligence can be develped”\n“I keep trying”\n“my mistakes will help me grow”\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nWe are going to go deeper in this session from the perspective of 2 main type of mindsets.\nThis is something we have noticed in various people that we’ve worked with and those in our friendship group. That some people have a fixed mindset and others have a growth mindset.\n\nA fixed mindset is a belief that your intelligence, talent and personality are inherently fixed and unchanging. In other words, you have a certain amount and nothing can change it. The ultimate desire in an individual with a fixed mindset is to be the best and to be seen as talented and perfect. This leads them to need constant validation and they seek to prove themselves over and over. Failure is simply not an option and they are extremely sensitive about making mistakes and being wrong. In the event that they do fail, they instantly become discouraged, give up and label themselves a ‘failure’. They avoid new challenges and will not risk doing anything that might expose their weaknesses and flaws.\n\nA growth mindset is the belief that your intelligence, talent and personality can be developed and cultivated through your actions. They believe that by learning and through constant practice, anyone can do anything. Their desire to become a better person fuels their passion to grow, take risks and do new things and they thrive on being challenged. For them, feedback is essential and provides them with constructive evidence to improve their performance and develop their abilities. In the event of failure, they see the setback.\n\n\n\nMINDSET MAP\nMap Practice and discussion: 10 minutes  \n\nPractice the mindset map with the entrepreneurs and show them the differences between the fixed and growth mindsets. Create a discussion among each one with them to better understand \n\nHOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nHave a discussion with the entrepreneurs on how to develop a growth mindset. Try to write down all the answers on the white board.\nAsk: How can you develop your growth mindset? What are actions you can take right now? \nPotential answers:\nBe aware of limiting behaviors and mindsets:\nYou believe life is permanent. The scarcity mentality sees life as fixed and unchangeable. It’s not seeing things as they truly are – temporary – and instead believing “that’s just the way it is and always will be.” An abundance mentality sees life as dynamic, malleable and in constant flux. Money comes and goes. Opportunities continually present themselves. Good and bad times will pass.\nYou use the language of lack. Do you find yourself using the following phrases often? “I can’t, I don’t have enough, I’ll just go without, I don’t need much.” Instead, experiment with the language of prosperity. “I always have more than enough, I can always find/earn more, there’s plenty.” \nYou hold on to things. Keeping items well past their useful point, food, clothes, shoes, trinkets, tools, gadgets…who knows what else. Get rid of things you don’t need – this creates the mindset that you can have more! \nYou have difficulty receiving. You have trouble accepting compliments or gifts, you’re uncomfortable with someone paying your way, and you feel like you have to even the score immediately.  If you cannot graciously receive then you mistakenly believe that when someone gives you something, they must have “lost” something in return. This is NOT how giving and receiving works. It’s scarcity mentality. \nYou make small gestures of lack. Under tipping, underestimating, shortchanging yourself or others. When you make small demonstrations of lack, you are keeping yourself from receiving more in life. If you believe in lack, not matter how small your actions may be, your life will mirror those same beliefs back to you.\nhttps://justwaybetter.com/2014/07/08/scarcity-vs-abundance-mindset/\nMake a conscious decision to shift from a limited mindset. Here are some ideas: \n1. Say ‘both’. When faced with a situation that you’d normally look at as ‘either-or’, try saying ‘both’. Should you get the new shed, or the new lawnmower? Both! Can you afford the new bag or just the new shoes. Both! Just saying ‘both’ makes it possible, and gets the creativity flowing (see #5 below).\n2. Say thank you when you receive a compliment. Don’t dismiss, deflect or try to quickly reciprocate – just accept a compliment as the gift that it is. Giving is a win-win. When you won’t accept a compliment, you make it lose-lose.\n3. Give or throw your old stuff away. Clothes are an easy one. Fill a trash bag with clothes you never wear and drop them at a clothing bin.\n4. Catch yourself when you say “I don’t have the time/money”. Be mindful that you always find the time and money for the things that are important – it’s a matter of priorities. Don’t delude yourself in small ways in speech and thought. Start to speak differently, and you’ll see your thinking start to change.\n5. Think of in terms of more. Instead of spending time figuring out how to save, skimp, or otherwise ‘afford’ the things you want, you could try spending that creative energy coming up with a way to make more money. Assuming you have a fixed income assumes you have maxed out your value to the world, and that you have no further ability to contribute or improve your skills. That’s literally a poor approach. Ask for that well overdue raise, sell some of your many things, try a small side business, optimize your investments, cut out wasteful spending (different than skimping), or all of the above. You might surprise yourself. It’s amazing what arises just by thinking differently.\n\nRecognize limiting beliefs: (“I can’t,” “I don’t have enough,” “There’s no opportunity here”).\nShift from scarcity to possibility: Instead of “We’ll run out of resources,” consider “How can we adapt or create solutions that respect those limits and still grow?”\nPractice self-encouragement: Celebrate progress, not just outcomes.\nTry new approaches: Adopt exploratory thinking—test small experiments, learn quickly, and iterate.\nReflect on impact: Ask, “How do my decisions affect the community, the environment, or future opportunities?”\n\n\nRecap: Practice thinking in abundance. Abundance applies to a lot more than money or material things, it applies to the really important things like time, opportunity, experiences, happiness and love. If you find that you have a scarcity mentality, it’s okay!  Most of us do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nPROCESS-FOCUSED\n“Success is a journey, not a destination”\n- Arthur Ashe\nLecture: 3 minutes  \n\nWe’ve all heard the saying, ‘Success is a journey, not a destination.’ This means that the process is more important than the outcome. Of course we all want to achieve success, but a fixation on the end-result, can lead to stress and fear of failure. It is most important for fixed mindset individuals to look good and be the best, so they often avoid taking action in case they fail. Tony Robbins calls this the ‘pain-pleasure’ syndrome. They will do more to avoid the pain of failure than they will to achieve the pleasure of success.\nHowever, the opposite is true of people with a growth mindset. They also want to achieve their desired outcome, but they understand that it is a process, which requires practice, effort and motivation. Their success is often a by-product of their dedication to the craft, whether it be a sport, business or a relationship.\nEncourage your entrepreneurs to celebrate the small wins along the way to achieving the end goal. Teach them the process behind the skill and provide them with the opportunity to practice, get feedback and ask questions.\n\nFocusing only on the end can create pressure and fear of failure.\nProcess includes consistent learning, refining ideas, and noticing how each choice affects your team, your customers, and—even in small ways—your broader environment.\nPeople with a growth mindset value continuous improvement. They pivot when things don’t work and adapt their approach.\nCelebrate small wins. Recognize that small positive changes can add up—like improving workflow efficiency or finding new ways to reduce waste.\n\n\n10\n\nPRAISE EFFORT\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nDweck’s research showed that ability can be developed through sheer effort and hard work, as opposed to natural talent. This is the key principle behind the concept of the growth mindset. However, most children are praised for their achievements by parents and educators, and rewards are given for attainment not effort.\nIn a growth mindset culture, praise and feedback is given for hard work and effort, not just for talent and ability. This means that in the training room, entrepreneurs should be praised for their willingness to try and for giving their best effort in every task, not purely on the outcome they achieve.\n\n11\n\nEMBRACE THE CHALLENGE\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nJ.K. Rowling’s first Harry Potter book was rejected by 12 publishers before it was eventually accepted and published. But she never gave up and the book went on the sell over 4oo million copies.\nSo create a safe learning environment which is conducive to the entrepreneurs trying new things, taking risks and pushing beyond their comfort zone. Encourage them to learn from their mistakes and use failure and setbacks as an opportunity to grow. Teach them the difference between ‘I am a failure’ and ‘I failed’, and instill the need to manage their motivation and keep moving forwards.\n\n12\n\nBE INSPIRED\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nPeople with a fixed mindset feel threatened by the success of others. However, in growth mindset individuals, the success of others is a massive source of inspiration for them personally, and they love to see others being successful.\nWho inspires you? It might be a person (famous or not, alive or dead), or it could be an organization. Think about why they inspire you. How can you use them as a key source of inspiration in your own life? For example, one of my hero’s in the context of creativity is Walt Disney. So whenever I am working on a creative project, I ask, ‘What would Walt do?’\n\n13\n\nPRACTICE, PRACTICE AND PRACTICE\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nIt takes consistent practice, patience and persistence to reach the level of mastery in anything – there are no quick fixes. Remember the 10,000 hours principle? The process of learning does not stop at the end of the training day. In fact, that’s when the real learning begins as entrepreneurs begin to apply their skills in their everyday work. Therefore, it is important that the entrepreneurs understand the need for consistent practice in order to embed the learning and to develop their proficiency. Create a mechanism to provide post-training support in the form of follow-up emails, webinars, online courses etc. Proactively encourage your entrepreneurs to feedback their progress, successes and failures in order that you can provide them with continuous development and inspiration into the future.\n\n14\n\nKEEP MOVING FORWARD!\nFailure is often inevitable, but if we learn to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn, improve, and then get back up again, we're more likely to succeed in future attempts.\n\nLearn that it's alright to fail as long as you don't give up or quit.\n\u000b\n15\n\nHOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE!\nBerries.com\n40 minutes : Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\nLet's not make a list of what we want to do, but rather, who we want to be! These are ways to be, not things to do. A goal is a destination; we can arrive there and yet be unsatisfied, feeling unsure where to go next. Values are like directions on the compass; we always know which way to travel. They define \"how: we want to live our lives. Of course our goals and reactions matter very much, but they are always more powerful when they are driven by our values. Our values express the states we essentially want to be in. Every action, large or small, can be an expression of what matters to us.\nLet's create a Vision Board or a journal to communicate and track WHO WE WANT TO BE! All your visions and goals should be in line with this. \n\n25 minutes: Activity \nAsk entrepreneurs to  create their Vision Board to communicate all their vision and goals to themselves that they can reflect on a daily basis. This should clearly communicate what they want in life to achieve on that board especially their goals for their businesses!\nIndividual work: On flipcharts, slides, or a video, map out your vision and goals. Include not just business milestones but also the values you want to live - how you want to be fair, resourceful, or mindful of social/environmental impacts.\nTool: PowerPoint, flipchart paper or any other medium would work. It could even be a video or slideshow they watch every morning. \n\n10 minutes: Share\nShow your Vision Board if you like. Notice if your brand, mission, and actions all align. Sometimes entrepreneurs discover they care about sustainability or social fairness and can incorporate that into their next steps.\n16\n\n\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US\n17\n"

Insert these slides directly after your current Slide 7 (\"FIXED MINDSET / GROWTH MINDSET\").\n2. These slides would naturally come before your current Slide 8 (\"MINDSET MAP\").\n\nThis placement works well because:\n- You've just introduced the concept of growth mindset\n- These slides build on that foundation by showing how sustainability thinking complements entrepreneurial growth\n- It flows naturally into your \"Mindset Map\" and \"How to Develop Your Growth Mindset\" sections that follow\n\nThe slides are deliberately kept simple and focused on the business benefits of sustainability thinking, rather than positioning sustainability as an add-on or separate concern. This approach aligns with your goal of showing how these mindsets are synergistic and mutually reinforcing for business success.",
