  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user requested help reorganizing and streamlining a strategic planning document for \"ToT Continuity\" (Training of Trainers program) focused on green housing/sustainable construction in Mosul, Iraq. The document contained significant duplication with sections 11.4 through 11.10 appearing twice with varying levels of detail. The user specifically asked Claude to rearrange content for better flow, eliminate duplications, preserve the authentic voice, and return the result as a markdown file.\n\nThrough multiple iterations, Claude helped merge the duplicated sections intelligently, keeping the more detailed versions where they existed, and reorganized the structure into a logical flow covering strategic overview, community building, leadership recognition, digital infrastructure, institutional partnerships, funding, government advocacy, and learning mechanisms. The user made several rounds of edits, particularly updating sections about funding approaches, community management requirements, and government subsidy advocacy strategies.\n\nA key challenge emerged when the user pointed out that Claude was overusing em dashes, which they identified as an AI writing giveaway based on a reference document about avoiding AI-generated text patterns. The user emphasized maintaining \"punchiness and easy readability\" while avoiding telltale AI writing habits like excessive em dashes, overly formal language, and emphatic phrases. In the final iteration, Claude replaced em dashes with simpler punctuation (periods, commas, colons) and preserved the direct, conversational tone of the original document.\n\nThe document discusses a sustainability plan for continuing green housing training programs in Iraq, involving partnerships with organizations like Mosul Space, universities, and government entities. Key figures mentioned include trainers like Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel, Wifaq Ahmed, and others, along with their institutional affiliations. The user demonstrated attention to authentic voice preservation and clear communication while working on what appears to be a professional development or capacity-building initiative in post-conflict reconstruction efforts.",

            "extracted_content": "Strategic Overview\nThe initial ToT cohorts (September-October 2025) trained 39 people across three modules. The question now is how this continues. Based on trainer feedback, expert interviews, and observing what Mosul Space already does through Climate Space, three approaches seem possible:\n\nApproach\nWhat It Looks Like\nStrengths\nChallenges\nOrganic Community\nMonthly gatherings at existing Climate Space, natural mentorship, minimal formal structure\nAuthentic, low overhead, builds on what works\nMay lack visibility for scaling, harder to measure\nInstitutional Embedding\nToT becomes part of university continuing education programs\nStable, credible, sustainable funding\nSlower to implement, less flexible\nHybrid Model\nCommunity gatherings + institutional anchors + selective structure where needed\nBalances authenticity with stability\nRequires coordination across multiple partners\n\n\nThis plan suggests a hybrid approach: connect to Climate Space for community building, partner with universities for stability, and add minimal infrastructure (digital directory, quality checks) only where gaps exist.\nIntroduction\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers during ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, and interviewing solar and insulation experts. The challenge is creating enough structure that people can connect without imposing so much that it feels bureaucratic.\n\nTrainers emphasized their work is motivated by service—rebuilding Mosul, reducing energy poverty, protecting the environment. Any continuation needs to honor that rather than replacing it with frameworks.\n\nThe ToT sessions are a beginning. What happens next depends on whether training helps people start businesses, get jobs, and serve their communities. These are possibilities to consider, not prescriptions to follow.\n11.1 Vision for Continuity\nSustainability happens when something serves people well enough that they want to keep it going—when it becomes part of how the community operates rather than a separate project.\n\nTrainer discussions revealed a guiding principle: \"Actions by their intentions.\" This work is service, not just employment. Trainers want to rebuild Mosul, reduce energy poverty, protect the environment. Continuation approaches should honor this motivation while providing practical support where needed.\n11.2 Connecting with Climate Space\nMosul Space runs monthly Climate Space gatherings where people talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and build community. People show up because these sessions serve them.\n\nThe green housing training community could connect to these existing gatherings rather than creating separate structures:\n\nAdd a \"Green Housing Update\" segment to Climate Space sessions (30 minutes per month)\nUse this time for trainers to share what's working, challenges they face, help they need\nLet mentorship connections form through regular gatherings\nAllow relationships to develop without assigning formal roles\n\nThis leverages the social capital and rhythm that already exists at Mosul Space. Monthly touchpoints create accountability without bureaucracy.\n11.3 Recognizing Natural Leadership\nSome trainers will become go-to resources through consistently good training, regular participation, generosity with time and knowledge, and stable institutional connections. No need for formal \"master trainer\" certifications.\n\nA few trainers demonstrated these qualities during initial ToT sessions:\n\nName\nModule\nStrengths\nInstitution\nDr. Abdulhakim Nabel\nSolar\nUniversity faculty, technical depth\nUniversity of Mosul\nHossam Al-Deen Khalil\nSolar\nCompany owner, practical experience\nAqtab Al-Taqa (solar)\nOmar Laith\nInsulation\nHands-on learning focus, architect\nAl-Rafedyen Architects\nWifaq Ahmed\nInsulation/Heritage\nGovernment subsidy knowledge\nMosul Heritage Foundation\nSaad Salih Dhiab\nInsulation\nUniversity faculty, hosts field visits\nAl-Noor University\n\n\nThese trainers could be invited to co-facilitate future ToT sessions if interested. Mosul Space or ITC could offer modest stipends, though motivation appears intrinsic. No formal title or obligation—just recognition and support.\n11.4 Creating Rhythm Through Events\nPeople need some rhythm to stay connected—enough touchpoints for relationships to develop without becoming burdensome.\n\nOne annual event possibility: Green Housing Showcase bringing together trainers, graduates, employers, suppliers, and policymakers. Elements could include portfolio showcase, design competition finale, informal jobs fair, supplier expo, and recognition awards (best retrofit impact, most innovative design).\n\nPractical approach: combine this with the Output 3.2 Design Competition Finale planned for 2026 rather than creating a separate event. This would reduce costs and complexity.\n\nThis is a suggestion for ITC and Mosul Space to consider. If it doesn't fit, the community will find other ways to celebrate and connect.\n\nMonthly touchpoints through Climate Space gatherings:\n\nGreen Housing update segment (30 minutes)\nTrainers share project stories, challenges, successes\nProblem-solving clinic for stuck situations\nSocial connection over tea\n\nFormat stays flexible—sometimes documentary, sometimes discussion, sometimes hands-on demonstration. Goal is building trust and relationships over time.\n\nPost-training 30-day reunions: 2-hour gatherings (in person or Zoom) where participants share what they've implemented since training. \"Show and tell\" format—people bring photos, describe challenges, get support. Natural opportunity to connect successful graduates with employers or clients.\n11.5 Digital Infrastructure\nAs the community grows, people need ways to find each other—trainers looking for apprentices, clients looking for consultants, graduates looking for mentors, suppliers looking for installers.\n\nSimple starting point: trainer directory using Airtable or Google Sheets with trainer profiles (name, module, location, contact), participant portfolios (photos, testimonials, project descriptions), and supplier list (materials, pricing, contact). Publicly accessible and searchable by module or location. Mosul Space staff updates quarterly.\n\nTrickier question: quality assurance. In solar especially, there's a trust crisis—CVs aren't reliable, and cheap fraudulent work has damaged the industry. Possible approaches: graduates review their training (anonymous or signed), clients review completed projects (with verification), peer feedback where trainers review each other's materials, independent quality checks by nonprofit or university assessors.\n\nGoal: create trusted signals in a market where they're lacking. Make quality visible and verifiable without bureaucracy.\n\nMore sophisticated systems could come later—AI-powered knowledge bases querying interview transcripts, training materials, case studies. But that's only worth pursuing if simple systems prove valuable first.\n11.6 Funding Sustainability\nITC funding supported initial ToT cohorts. What happens after is an open question.\n\nPotential funding sources to explore: Employer-sponsored training where solar companies send staff to ToT, this already happens informally and is to be explored, what were the expected benefits and did the training provide value we can capitalize on?\n\nUniversity partnerships where ToT embeds in continuing education programs, with universities providing venues and certification adding credibility. Dr. Abdulhakim at University of Mosul and Saad Salih at Al-Noor University expressed interest. Participant fees on a sliding scale where those who can afford to contribute pay (around 50,000 IQD) while others receive scholarships. Grant funding from development agencies like UNDP and GIZ that support green skills training. Government subsidy expansion for insulation materials, which would increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates.\n\n11.7 Rooting in Institutions\nTo avoid dependence on one or two individuals, root the work in institutions:\n\nMosul Space provides convening power—hosting Climate Space gatherings, managing WhatsApp groups, coordinating event logistics. Stable organization with diverse funding.\n\nUniversity of Mosul offers academic credibility through partnership with Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel. Potential to embed ToT in continuing education, providing access to facilities and long-term stability.\n\nAl-Noor University through Saad Salih Dhiab offered to host field visits and is interested in formal partnership. Could provide training venues and practical learning opportunities.\n\nIraqi Engineering Union might recognize ToT as professional development credit. Since engineers need continuing education for licensure, this could increase participation and credibility.\n\nSimple memorandums of understanding (1-2 pages each) could clarify roles without bureaucracy.\n11.8 Government Subsidy Advocacy\nWifaq Ahmed from Mosul Heritage Foundation mentioned: Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials (cement, rebar). Homeowners get money back. She suggested exploring whether this subsidy could expand to insulation materials.\n\nCurrently insulation is seen as luxury rather than essential. If government subsidy covered 30-50% of insulation costs, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years. Mass adoption becomes economically feasible. Since policy framework exists, expansion might be politically realistic—adding items to an existing list, not creating new program.\n\nPossible advocacy approach (2-3 years): Document the case with ToT graduate case studies showing energy savings, health benefits, comfort improvements. Calculate broader impacts: households who could afford insulation, jobs created, reduction in fuel imports. Build coalition including University of Mosul (academic credibility), Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement), private sector suppliers like SIKA and SMTC (who would benefit), and ITC (international reputation, economic development expertise). Run pilot demonstration retrofitting 10-20 homes with ITC or UNDP funding. Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials. Invite government officials to site visits at annual showcase event. Submit policy brief to Ministry of Construction and Housing: subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience—achievable by adding a few items to existing subsidy list.\n\nITC role: leverage existing government relationships, provide technical analysis, help coordinate coalition. Long-term work, but potentially transformational if successful.\n11.9 Learning From Practice\nSimple feedback mechanisms to help training evolve: Post-training surveys (week after ToT) asking what worked, what needs improvement, whether trainers feel ready. Already being done (feedback forms attached), insights inform next cohorts. 30-day reunion check-ins to see who's implementing and what challenges they face. Real-world implementation reveals curriculum gaps. \n\nMonthly Climate Space discussions where organic feedback emerges through regular gatherings. Climate space can be the meeting point for trainers and participants, so when trainers keep hearing \"participants ask about X,\" that signals something to add. Employer feedback from apprenticeship partners about whether graduates show up with needed skills and what's missing. This closes loop between training content and market needs. Annual curriculum reviews where trainers gather once a year to update materials—add new technologies, remove outdated content, incorporate field lessons.\n11.10 ITC's Continuing Role\nShort term (2025-2026): Fund initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad. Support annual showcase event if it happens. Help develop simple digital trainer directory. Facilitate university partnerships.\n\nMedium term (2026-2027): Transition coordination to Mosul Space. Support government subsidy advocacy if it moves forward. Help develop quality assurance systems. Document case studies for replication in other regions.\n\nLong term (2027+): Periodic check-ins rather than daily management. Available for troubleshooting but not driving. Opportunities to share model with other Iraqi cities or conflict-affected regions while Mosul community increasingly owns and evolves the work.\n\nMy continuing involvement: conducting expert interviews when needed for expansions, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which have been enjoyable), building and maintaining digital infrastructure, developing quality assurance and review systems. Depends on funding and what makes sense as things develop.\n11.4 Community of Practice Mechanisms\nSustainability isn't just financial — it's about keeping the community engaged between formal trainings.\nWhatsApp Community Groups\nPurpose: Homework assignments, supplier photos, quick Q&A, peer support\nCadence: Daily activity during training cohorts; weekly check-ins between cohorts\nContent shared:\n\"I just visited this supplier — here's their pricing for EPS insulation\"\n\"Client asked about payback period — how do I calculate with rising tariffs?\"\n\"Check out this retrofit project I completed — before/after photos\"\nModeration: 1-2 master trainers + Mosul Space coordinator keep discussions focused\n\nCurrent Status: Active WhatsApp groups already exist for Solar (25 members) and Insulation (14 members) cohorts. Merge into a single \"Green Housing Trainers - Iraq\" group to foster cross-module learning.\n\n\nBi-Annual Trainer Gatherings\nFrequency: Twice per year (May & November)\nFormat: 1-day convening (not full ToT, but refresher + strategy session)\nAgenda:\nMorning: \"How are trainings going?\" (trainers share successes, challenges)\nAfternoon: Curriculum updates (new materials, new techniques, feedback from participants)\nEvening: Social / networking (build relationships, celebrate impact)\nHost: Leverage Mosul Space's \"Climate Space\" existing convening power (they already host quarterly green business events)\n\nCost: 500,000 IQD per gathering (venue, tea, light refreshments) × 2/year = 1,000,000 IQD/year (~$700 USD, absorbable by IP budget)\n\n\nMonthly Reunion (Post-Training Cohorts)\nTiming: 30 days after each training cohort completes\nPurpose: Check-in on real-world implementation\nSolar: \"Did you complete an installation? Show photos!\"\nInsulation: \"Did you assess a home? Calculate savings?\"\nArchitecture: \"Did you present a green design to a client? How did they react?\"\nFormat: 2-hour session (in-person or Zoom)\nFirst hour: Show & tell (participants share portfolio pieces)\nSecond hour: Problem-solving clinic (troubleshoot challenges)\nOutcome: Builds accountability, surfaces curriculum gaps, creates social proof (\"If they can do it, so can I\")\n\nIntegration with Apprenticeships: This monthly reunion is when trainees present portfolio pieces to potential employers (see Section 9.2 Framework).\n\n\n11.5 Institutional Anchors\nTo avoid \"hero-dependent\" sustainability (where everything collapses if one person leaves), we anchor the ToT model to institutions:\n\nAnchor 1: Mosul Space Organization (Community Convening Power)\nRole: Host ToT sessions, manage WhatsApp groups, coordinate logistics\nExisting Capacity: Mosul Space already runs \"Climate Space\" (quarterly green business events), so green housing ToT fits naturally\nSustainability: Mosul Space has diverse funding (not dependent on one donor), ensuring continuity\n\nAnchor 2: Iraqi Engineering Union (Professional Certification)\nRole: Recognize ToT certification as professional development credit for engineers\nBenefits: Engineers need continuing education credits to maintain licensure — ToT can fulfill this requirement\nNext Step: Explore partnership with Engineering Union via ITC contacts (Lada coordinates)\n11.7 Green Home Festival / Fair (FLAGSHIP RECOMMENDATION)\n\nConcept\nBring together trainers, participants, suppliers, employers, policymakers, homeowners for a 1-day showcase event that:\nRaises awareness about green housing solutions\nShowcases trainee portfolios (before/after photos, ROI calculations, design competition winners)\nConnects trainees with employers (jobs fair component)\nFacilitates matchmaking (mentors ↔ cofounders, suppliers ↔ installers, clients ↔ consultants)\nCelebrates success (awards for best retrofit, most innovative design, community impact)\n\nTiming & Integration\n\nPiggyback on existing BEIT events to minimize costs:\n3.2 Design Competition Finale (200 houses, retrofit product startup, model homes) — happening in 2026\nGreen Home Festival becomes the showcase event for design competition winners + ToT graduate portfolios\nBudget: Add 2-3M IQD (~$1,400-2,000 USD) to existing 3.2 event budget (vs. 10M+ IQD for standalone event)\n\nExpected Outcomes\nVisibility: 200+ attendees (trainers, trainees, employers, policymakers, media)\nJobs: 10-15 trainees matched with employers during event\nAwareness: Social media coverage (each trainee shares photos → 100 trainees × 200 followers = 20,000 reach)\nPolicy momentum: Government officials see market demand → consider subsidy expansion\nCommunity cohesion: \"We're not just isolated trainers — we're part of a movement\"\n\nRecommendation: Allocate budget in 2026 planning; coordinate with 3.2 design competition lead.\n\n11.8 Digital Community Hub (Future Vision)\nConcept\nEvolve the Google Drive materials repository into a digital community hub that serves as:\nTrainer Directory: Profiles with credentials, contact info, specializations \"Need a solar trainer in Anbar? Here are 5 certified trainers with reviews.\"\nParticipant Portfolio Gallery: Showcase trainee work (before/after photos, testimonials) \"Employers: Browse portfolios, hire certified green housing professionals.\"\nSupplier Database: Pricing, specs, contact info for vetted suppliers \"Where can I buy EPS insulation in Mosul? Here are 3 suppliers with datasheets.\"\nQueryable Knowledge Base (RAG System): AI-powered Q&A \"What's the ROI for roof insulation in a 150m² home?\" → system retrieves data from trainer interviews, case studies\nEvent Calendar: Upcoming ToTs, monthly reunions, Green Home Festival\n\nPhase 1 (2026): Simple Directory (Low-Tech)\nPlatform: Airtable or Google Sheets (accessible, no coding required)\nContent: Trainer profiles, participant portfolios (PDF exports), supplier list\nAccess: Public (to maximize visibility), or login-required (if privacy needed)\n\nPhase 2 (2027): Interactive Hub (Medium-Tech)\nPlatform: Custom website (WordPress + database)\nFeatures: Search/filter trainers by module, location; submit portfolio; request mentorship\nMaintenance: Mosul Space designates 1 staff member as \"community manager\" (5-10 hrs/week)\n11.9 Government Subsidy Advocacy (HIGH-IMPACT LEVERAGE POINT)\nThe Opportunity (from Wifaq Ahmed, Mosul Heritage Foundation)\n\"The Iraqi government already has a subsidy program for construction materials,  homeowners can get money back when they buy cement, rebar, etc. We should advocate to expand this subsidy to include insulation materials (EPS, XPS, mineral wool, reflective barriers).\"\n\nWhy This Matters:\nCurrent barrier: Insulation perceived as \"luxury\" (not essential like cement)\nSubsidy changes economics: If government covers 30-50% of insulation cost, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years and promotes mass adoption\nPrecedent exists: Government already subsidizes construction materials, so expansion is politically feasible (not creating new program, just adding items to existing list)\n\nAdvocacy Strategy\nDocument the case (by Dec 2025):\nCompile ToT participant case studies showing ROI of insulation (energy savings, health benefits, comfort)\nCalculate: \"If government subsidized insulation, X households could afford it → Y jobs created → Z reduction in generator fuel imports\"\n\nIdentify decision-makers and Build coalition:\nUniversity of Mosul (academic credibility)\nIraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement)\nPrivate sector (suppliers like SIKA, SMTC benefit → lobby support)\nITC (international reputation, economic development expertise)\n\nPolicy brief submission (2026):\nITC submits formal recommendation to Ministry of Construction\nKey message: \"Subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience — achievable by adding 5 items to existing subsidy list\"\n\nTimeline: 2-3 years (advocacy is slow), but if successful it can have a transformational impact on market demand for insulation and lead to more jobs for BEIT trainees.\n\nITC Role: Leverage relationships with government (existing from other ITC Iraq projects), provide technical analysis, coordinate coalition.\n11.10 Continuous Improvement: Feedback Loops\nSustainability requires ongoing adaptation based on what's working in the field.\nFeedback Mechanisms\nPost-Training Surveys (1 week after ToT) \"What worked? What needs improvement? Are you ready to train?\"\nMonthly Reunion Check-Ins (30 days post-training) \"Did you deliver your first training session? What challenges did you face? What resources do you need?\"\nBi-Annual Curriculum Review (May & Nov gatherings) \"What new materials/techniques should we add? What's outdated? What are participants asking about that we didn't cover?\"\nEmployer Feedback (from apprenticeship partners) \"Are trainees showing up with the skills we need? What's missing?\"\nParticipant Feedback (from training cohorts taught by ToT graduates) \"How was the training? Did the trainer explain clearly? What would you change?\"\n\nCurriculum Update Process: \nExample: If multiple trainers report \"Participants struggle with U-value calculations\", then:\nUpdate: Add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems\nPilot: Test in next Anbar ToT cohort\nAssess: Did it help? If yes → keep; if no → iterate\nConclusion\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers, reviewing feedback, and thinking about how communities sustain themselves. The approach leans toward minimal structure—just enough for people to connect—while trusting that if training serves people, they'll figure out how to keep it going.\n\nCore ideas: Connect with what already exists (Mosul Space's Climate Space) rather than building parallel structures. Recognize natural leadership through quality work and generosity rather than creating formal hierarchies. Create rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep format flexible. Build simple digital infrastructure that evolves based on what proves useful. Explore multiple funding possibilities without engineering a perfect model—if training creates value, funding will emerge. Root work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend on specific individuals. Consider long-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion (2-3 years, potentially transformational). Keep learning from practice through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews. Scale only if community is healthy and trainers are succeeding—quality and authenticity matter more than growth.\n\nThe ToT sessions (September-October 2025) are a promising beginning to a community of practice that can possible emerge based on the good will and generosity of the community that showed up. These recommendations are possibilities for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not prescriptions to follow..\n\n"

              "file_text": "# Strategic Plan for ToT Continuity\n\n## Strategic Overview\n\nThe initial ToT cohorts (September-October 2025) trained 39 people across three modules. The question now is how this continues. Based on trainer feedback, expert interviews, and observing what Mosul Space already does through Climate Space, three approaches seem possible:\n\n| Approach | What It Looks Like | Strengths | Challenges |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Organic Community | Monthly gatherings at existing Climate Space, natural mentorship, minimal formal structure | Authentic, low overhead, builds on what works | May lack visibility for scaling, harder to measure |\n| Institutional Embedding | ToT becomes part of university continuing education programs | Stable, credible, sustainable funding | Slower to implement, less flexible |\n| Hybrid Model | Community gatherings + institutional anchors + selective structure where needed | Balances authenticity with stability | Requires coordination across multiple partners |\n\nThis plan suggests a hybrid approach: connect to Climate Space for community building, partner with universities for stability, and add minimal infrastructure (digital directory, quality checks) only where gaps exist.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers during ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, and interviewing solar and insulation experts. The challenge is creating enough structure that people can connect without imposing so much that it feels bureaucratic.\n\nTrainers emphasized their work is motivated by service—rebuilding Mosul, reducing energy poverty, protecting the environment. Any continuation needs to honor that rather than replacing it with frameworks.\n\nThe ToT sessions are a beginning. What happens next depends on whether training helps people start businesses, get jobs, and serve their communities. These are possibilities to consider, not prescriptions to follow.\n\n## Vision for Continuity\n\nSustainability happens when something serves people well enough that they want to keep it going—when it becomes part of how the community operates rather than a separate project.\n\nTrainer discussions revealed a guiding principle: \"Actions by their intentions.\" This work is service, not just employment. Trainers want to rebuild Mosul, reduce energy poverty, protect the environment. Continuation approaches should honor this motivation while providing practical support where needed.\n\n## Community Building\n\n### Connecting with Climate Space\n\nMosul Space runs monthly Climate Space gatherings where people talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and build community. People show up because these sessions serve them.\n\nThe green housing training community could connect to these existing gatherings rather than creating separate structures:\n\n- Add a \"Green Housing Update\" segment to Climate Space sessions (30 minutes per month)\n- Use this time for trainers to share what's working, challenges they face, help they need\n- Let mentorship connections form through regular gatherings\n- Allow relationships to develop without assigning formal roles\n\nThis leverages the social capital and rhythm that already exists at Mosul Space. Monthly touchpoints create accountability without bureaucracy.\n\n### WhatsApp Community Groups\n\n**Purpose:** Homework assignments, supplier photos, quick Q&A, peer support\n\n**Cadence:** Daily activity during training cohorts; weekly check-ins between cohorts\n\n**Content shared:**\n- \"I just visited this supplier — here's their pricing for EPS insulation\"\n- \"Client asked about payback period — how do I calculate with rising tariffs?\"\n- \"Check out this retrofit project I completed — before/after photos\"\n\n**Moderation:** 1-2 master trainers + Mosul Space coordinator keep discussions focused\n\n**Current Status:** Active WhatsApp groups already exist for Solar (25 members) and Insulation (14 members) cohorts. Merge into a single \"Green Housing Trainers - Iraq\" group to foster cross-module learning.\n\n### Creating Rhythm Through Events\n\nPeople need some rhythm to stay connected—enough touchpoints for relationships to develop without becoming burdensome.\n\n**Monthly touchpoints through Climate Space gatherings:**\n- Green Housing update segment (30 minutes)\n- Trainers share project stories, challenges, successes\n- Problem-solving clinic for stuck situations\n- Social connection over tea\n\nFormat stays flexible—sometimes documentary, sometimes discussion, sometimes hands-on demonstration. Goal is building trust and relationships over time.\n\n**Post-training 30-day reunions:**\n\n**Timing:** 30 days after each training cohort completes\n\n**Format:** 2-hour gatherings (in person or Zoom) where participants share what they've implemented since training. \"Show and tell\" format—people bring photos, describe challenges, get support. Natural opportunity to connect successful graduates with employers or clients.\n\n**Outcome:** Builds accountability, surfaces curriculum gaps, creates social proof (\"If they can do it, so can I\")\n\n**Integration with Apprenticeships:** This monthly reunion is when trainees present portfolio pieces to potential employers.\n\n**Bi-Annual Trainer Gatherings:**\n\n**Frequency:** Twice per year (May & November)\n\n**Format:** 1-day convening (not full ToT, but refresher + strategy session)\n\n**Agenda:**\n- Morning: \"How are trainings going?\" (trainers share successes, challenges)\n- Afternoon: Curriculum updates (new materials, new techniques, feedback from participants)\n- Evening: Social / networking (build relationships, celebrate impact)\n\n**Host:** Leverage Mosul Space's \"Climate Space\" existing convening power (they already host quarterly green business events)\n\n**Cost:** 500,000 IQD per gathering (venue, tea, light refreshments) × 2/year = 1,000,000 IQD/year (~$700 USD, absorbable by IP budget)\n\n### Green Home Festival / Fair (FLAGSHIP RECOMMENDATION)\n\n**Concept:** Bring together trainers, participants, suppliers, employers, policymakers, homeowners for a 1-day showcase event that:\n- Raises awareness about green housing solutions\n- Showcases trainee portfolios (before/after photos, ROI calculations, design competition winners)\n- Connects trainees with employers (jobs fair component)\n- Facilitates matchmaking (mentors ↔ cofounders, suppliers ↔ installers, clients ↔ consultants)\n- Celebrates success (awards for best retrofit, most innovative design, community impact)\n\n**Timing & Integration:** Piggyback on existing BEIT events to minimize costs—the 3.2 Design Competition Finale (200 houses, retrofit product startup, model homes) happening in 2026. Green Home Festival becomes the showcase event for design competition winners + ToT graduate portfolios.\n\n**Budget:** Add 2-3M IQD (~$1,400-2,000 USD) to existing 3.2 event budget (vs. 10M+ IQD for standalone event)\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n- Visibility: 200+ attendees (trainers, trainees, employers, policymakers, media)\n- Jobs: 10-15 trainees matched with employers during event\n- Awareness: Social media coverage (each trainee shares photos → 100 trainees × 200 followers = 20,000 reach)\n- Policy momentum: Government officials see market demand → consider subsidy expansion\n- Community cohesion: \"We're not just isolated trainers — we're part of a movement\"\n\n**Recommendation:** Allocate budget in 2026 planning; coordinate with 3.2 design competition lead.\n\n## Recognizing Natural Leadership\n\nSome trainers will become go-to resources through consistently good training, regular participation, generosity with time and knowledge, and stable institutional connections. No need for formal \"master trainer\" certifications.\n\nA few trainers demonstrated these qualities during initial ToT sessions:\n\n| Name | Module | Strengths | Institution |\n|------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n| Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel | Solar | University faculty, technical depth | University of Mosul |\n| Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | Solar | Company owner, practical experience | Aqtab Al-Taqa (solar) |\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | Hands-on learning focus, architect | Al-Rafedyen Architects |\n| Wifaq Ahmed | Insulation/Heritage | Government subsidy knowledge | Mosul Heritage Foundation |\n| Saad Salih Dhiab | Insulation | University faculty, hosts field visits | Al-Noor University |\n\nThese trainers could be invited to co-facilitate future ToT sessions if interested. Mosul Space or ITC could offer modest stipends, though motivation appears intrinsic. No formal title or obligation—just recognition and support.\n\n## Digital Infrastructure\n\nAs the community grows, people need ways to find each other—trainers looking for apprentices, clients looking for consultants, graduates looking for mentors, suppliers looking for installers.\n\n### Phase 1 (2026): Simple Directory (Low-Tech)\n\n**Platform:** Airtable or Google Sheets (accessible, no coding required)\n\n**Content:** \n- Trainer profiles (name, module, location, contact)\n- Participant portfolios (photos, testimonials, project descriptions)\n- Supplier list (materials, pricing, contact)\n\n**Access:** Publicly accessible and searchable by module or location. Mosul Space staff updates quarterly.\n\n### Phase 2 (2027): Interactive Hub (Medium-Tech)\n\n**Concept:** Evolve the Google Drive materials repository into a digital community hub that serves as:\n- **Trainer Directory:** Profiles with credentials, contact info, specializations (\"Need a solar trainer in Anbar? Here are 5 certified trainers with reviews.\")\n- **Participant Portfolio Gallery:** Showcase trainee work (before/after photos, testimonials) (\"Employers: Browse portfolios, hire certified green housing professionals.\")\n- **Supplier Database:** Pricing, specs, contact info for vetted suppliers (\"Where can I buy EPS insulation in Mosul? Here are 3 suppliers with datasheets.\")\n- **Queryable Knowledge Base (RAG System):** AI-powered Q&A (\"What's the ROI for roof insulation in a 150m² home?\" → system retrieves data from trainer interviews, case studies)\n- **Event Calendar:** Upcoming ToTs, monthly reunions, Green Home Festival\n\n**Platform:** Custom website (WordPress + database)\n\n**Features:** Search/filter trainers by module, location; submit portfolio; request mentorship\n\n**Maintenance:** Mosul Space designates 1 staff member as \"community manager\" (5-10 hrs/week)\n\n### Quality Assurance\n\nTrickier question: quality assurance. In solar especially, there's a trust crisis—CVs aren't reliable, and cheap fraudulent work has damaged the industry. \n\n**Possible approaches:**\n- Graduates review their training (anonymous or signed)\n- Clients review completed projects (with verification)\n- Peer feedback where trainers review each other's materials\n- Independent quality checks by nonprofit or university assessors\n\nGoal: create trusted signals in a market where they're lacking. Make quality visible and verifiable without bureaucracy.\n\nMore sophisticated systems could come later, but that's only worth pursuing if simple systems prove valuable first.\n\n## Institutional Anchors\n\nTo avoid \"hero-dependent\" sustainability (where everything collapses if one person leaves), root the work in institutions:\n\n### Mosul Space (Community Convening Power)\n\n**Role:** Host ToT sessions, manage WhatsApp groups, coordinate logistics\n\n**Existing Capacity:** Mosul Space already runs \"Climate Space\" (quarterly green business events), so green housing ToT fits naturally\n\n**Sustainability:** Mosul Space has diverse funding (not dependent on one donor), ensuring continuity\n\n### University of Mosul\n\n**Role:** Academic credibility through partnership with Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel\n\n**Potential:** Embed ToT in continuing education, providing access to facilities and long-term stability\n\n### Al-Noor University\n\n**Role:** Through Saad Salih Dhiab—offered to host field visits and is interested in formal partnership\n\n**Potential:** Provide training venues and practical learning opportunities\n\n### Iraqi Engineering Union (Professional Certification)\n\n**Role:** Recognize ToT certification as professional development credit for engineers\n\n**Benefits:** Engineers need continuing education credits to maintain licensure—ToT can fulfill this requirement\n\n**Next Step:** Explore partnership with Engineering Union via ITC contacts (Lada coordinates)\n\nSimple memorandums of understanding (1-2 pages each) could clarify roles without bureaucracy.\n\n## Funding Sustainability\n\nITC funding supported initial ToT cohorts. What happens after is an open question.\n\n**Potential funding sources to explore:**\n\n**Employer-sponsored training:** Solar companies send staff to ToT—this already happens informally and is to be explored. What were the expected benefits and did the training provide value we can capitalize on?\n\n**University partnerships:** ToT embeds in continuing education programs, with universities providing venues and certification adding credibility. Dr. Abdulhakim at University of Mosul and Saad Salih at Al-Noor University expressed interest.\n\n**Participant fees:** Sliding scale where those who can afford to contribute pay (around 50,000 IQD) while others receive scholarships.\n\n**Grant funding:** Development agencies like UNDP and GIZ that support green skills training.\n\n**Government subsidy expansion:** For insulation materials, which would increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates.\n\n## Government Subsidy Advocacy (HIGH-IMPACT LEVERAGE POINT)\n\n### The Opportunity (from Wifaq Ahmed, Mosul Heritage Foundation)\n\n\"The Iraqi government already has a subsidy program for construction materials—homeowners can get money back when they buy cement, rebar, etc. We should advocate to expand this subsidy to include insulation materials (EPS, XPS, mineral wool, reflective barriers).\"\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n**Current barrier:** Insulation perceived as \"luxury\" (not essential like cement)\n\n**Subsidy changes economics:** If government covers 30-50% of insulation cost, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years—mass adoption becomes economically feasible.\n\n**Precedent exists:** Since policy framework exists, expansion might be politically realistic—adding items to an existing list, not creating new program.\n\n### Advocacy Strategy\n\n**Document the case (by Dec 2025):**\n- Compile ToT participant case studies showing ROI of insulation (energy savings, health benefits, comfort)\n- Calculate: \"If government subsidized insulation, X households could afford it → Y jobs created → Z reduction in generator fuel imports\"\n\n**Build coalition:**\n- University of Mosul (academic credibility)\n- Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement)\n- Private sector suppliers like SIKA and SMTC (who would benefit)\n- ITC (international reputation, economic development expertise)\n\n**Run pilot:** Demonstration retrofitting 10-20 homes with ITC or UNDP funding. Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials. Invite government officials to site visits at annual showcase event.\n\n**Policy brief submission (2026):**\n- ITC submits formal recommendation to Ministry of Construction and Housing\n- Key message: \"Subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience—achievable by adding a few items to existing subsidy list\"\n\n**Timeline:** 2-3 years (advocacy is slow), but if successful, potentially transformational impact on market demand for insulation.\n\n**ITC Role:** Leverage existing government relationships, provide technical analysis, help coordinate coalition. Long-term work, but potentially transformational if successful.\n\n## Learning From Practice\n\nSustainability requires ongoing adaptation based on what's working in the field.\n\n### Feedback Mechanisms\n\n**Post-training surveys (week after ToT):** \"What worked? What needs improvement? Are you ready to train?\" Already being done (feedback forms attached), insights inform next cohorts.\n\n**30-day reunion check-ins:** See who's implementing and what challenges they face. Real-world implementation reveals curriculum gaps. \"Did you deliver your first training session? What challenges did you face? What resources do you need?\"\n\n**Monthly Climate Space discussions:** Organic feedback emerges through regular gatherings. When trainers keep hearing \"participants ask about X,\" that signals something to add.\n\n**Employer feedback (from apprenticeship partners):** \"Are trainees showing up with the skills we need? What's missing?\" This closes loop between training content and market needs.\n\n**Bi-annual curriculum reviews (May & Nov gatherings):** \"What new materials/techniques should we add? What's outdated? What are participants asking about that we didn't cover?\" Trainers gather to update materials—add new technologies, remove outdated content, incorporate field lessons.\n\n**Participant feedback:** From training cohorts taught by ToT graduates. \"How was the training? Did the trainer explain clearly? What would you change?\"\n\n### Curriculum Update Process\n\nExample: If multiple trainers report \"Participants struggle with U-value calculations,\" then:\n- **Update:** Add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems\n- **Pilot:** Test in next Anbar ToT cohort\n- **Assess:** Did it help? If yes → keep; if no → iterate\n\n## ITC's Continuing Role\n\n**Short term (2025-2026):** Fund initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad. Support annual showcase event if it happens. Help develop simple digital trainer directory. Facilitate university partnerships.\n\n**Medium term (2026-2027):** Transition coordination to Mosul Space. Support government subsidy advocacy if it moves forward. Help develop quality assurance systems. Document case studies for replication in other regions.\n\n**Long term (2027+):** Periodic check-ins rather than daily management. Available for troubleshooting but not driving. Opportunities to share model with other Iraqi cities or conflict-affected regions while Mosul community increasingly owns and evolves the work.\n\n**My continuing involvement:** Conducting expert interviews when needed for expansions, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which have been enjoyable), building and maintaining digital infrastructure, developing quality assurance and review systems. Depends on funding and what makes sense as things develop.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers, reviewing feedback, and thinking about how communities sustain themselves. The approach leans toward minimal structure—just enough for people to connect—while trusting that if training serves people, they'll figure out how to keep it going.\n\n**Core ideas:**\n- Connect with what already exists (Mosul Space's Climate Space) rather than building parallel structures\n- Recognize natural leadership through quality work and generosity rather than creating formal hierarchies\n- Create rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep format flexible\n- Build simple digital infrastructure that evolves based on what proves useful\n- Explore multiple funding possibilities without engineering a perfect model—if training creates value, funding will emerge\n- Root work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend on specific individuals\n- Consider long-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion (2-3 years, potentially transformational)\n- Keep learning from practice through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews\n- Scale only if community is healthy and trainers are succeeding—quality and authenticity matter more than growth\n\nThe ToT sessions (September-October 2025) are a promising beginning to a community of practice that can possibly emerge based on the good will and generosity of the community that showed up. These recommendations are possibilities for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not prescriptions to follow.\n",

Make quality visible and verifiable without bureaucracy.\\n\\nMore sophisticated systems could come later, but that's only worth pursuing if simple systems prove valuable first.\\n\\n## Institutional Anchors\\n\\nTo avoid \\\"hero-dependent\\\" sustainability (where everything collapses if one person leaves), root the work in institutions:\\n\\n### Mosul Space (Community Convening Power)\\n\\n**Role:** Host ToT sessions, manage WhatsApp groups, coordinate logistics\\n\\n**Existing Capacity:** Mosul Space already runs \\\"Climate Space\\\" (quarterly green business events), so green housing ToT fits naturally\\n\\n**Sustainability:** Mosul Space has diverse funding (not dependent on one donor), ensuring continuity\\n\\n### University of Mosul\\n\\n**Role:** Academic credibility through partnership with Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel\\n\\n**Potential:** Embed ToT in continuing education, providing access to facilities and long-term stability\\n\\n### Al-Noor University\\n\\n**Role:** Through Saad Salih Dhiab\\u2014offered to host field visits and is interested in formal partnership\\n\\n**Potential:** Provide training venues and practical learning opportunities\\n\\n### Iraqi Engineering Union (Professional Certification)\\n\\n**Role:** Recognize ToT certification as professional development credit for engineers\\n\\n**Benefits:** Engineers need continuing education credits to maintain licensure\\u2014ToT can fulfill this requirement\\n\\n**Next Step:** Explore partnership with Engineering Union via ITC contacts (Lada coordinates)\\n\\nSimple memorandums of understanding (1-2 pages each) could clarify roles without bureaucracy.\\n\\n## Funding Sustainability\\n\\nITC funding supported initial ToT cohorts. What happens after is an open question.\\n\\n**Potential funding sources to explore:**\\n\\n**Employer-sponsored training:** Solar companies send staff to ToT\\u2014this already happens informally and is to be explored. What were the expected benefits and did the training provide value we can capitalize on?\\n\\n**University partnerships:** ToT embeds in continuing education programs, with universities providing venues and certification adding credibility. Dr. Abdulhakim at University of Mosul and Saad Salih at Al-Noor University expressed interest.\\n\\n**Participant fees:** Sliding scale where those who can afford to contribute pay (around 50,000 IQD) while others receive scholarships.\\n\\n**Grant funding:** Development agencies like UNDP and GIZ that support green skills training.\\n\\n**Government subsidy expansion:** For insulation materials, which would increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates.\\n\\n## Government Subsidy Advocacy (HIGH-IMPACT LEVERAGE POINT)\\n\\n### The Opportunity (from Wifaq Ahmed, Mosul Heritage Foundation)\\n\\n\\\"The Iraqi government already has a subsidy program for construction materials\\u2014homeowners can get money back when they buy cement, rebar, etc. We should advocate to expand this subsidy to include insulation materials (EPS, XPS, mineral wool, reflective barriers).\\\"\\n\\n### Why This Matters\\n\\n**Current barrier:** Insulation perceived as \\\"luxury\\\" (not essential like cement)\\n\\n**Subsidy changes economics:** If government covers 30-50% of insulation cost, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years\\u2014mass adoption becomes economically feasible.\\n\\n**Precedent exists:** Since policy framework exists, expansion might be politically realistic\\u2014adding items to an existing list, not creating new program.\\n\\n### Advocacy Strategy\\n\\n**Document the case (by Dec 2025):**\\n- Compile ToT participant case studies showing ROI of insulation (energy savings, health benefits, comfort)\\n- Calculate: \\\"If government subsidized insulation, X households could afford it \\u2192 Y jobs created \\u2192 Z reduction in generator fuel imports\\\"\\n\\n**Build coalition:**\\n- University of Mosul (academic credibility)\\n- Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement)\\n- Private sector suppliers like SIKA and SMTC (who would benefit)\\n- ITC (international reputation, economic development expertise)\\n\\n**Run pilot:** Demonstration retrofitting 10-20 homes with ITC or UNDP funding. Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials. Invite government officials to site visits at annual showcase event.\\n\\n**Policy brief submission (2026):**\\n- ITC submits formal recommendation to Ministry of Construction and Housing\\n- Key message: \\\"Subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience\\u2014achievable by adding a few items to existing subsidy list\\\"\\n\\n**Timeline:** 2-3 years (advocacy is slow), but if successful, potentially transformational impact on market demand for insulation.\\n\\n**ITC Role:** Leverage existing government relationships, provide technical analysis, help coordinate coalition. Long-term work, but potentially transformational if successful.\\n\\n## Learning From Practice\\n\\nSustainability requires ongoing adaptation based on what's working in the field.\\n\\n### Feedback Mechanisms\\n\\n**Post-training surveys (week after ToT):** \\\"What worked? What needs improvement? Are you ready to train?\\\" Already being done (feedback forms attached), insights inform next cohorts.\\n\\n**30-day reunion check-ins:** See who's implementing and what challenges they face. Real-world implementation reveals curriculum gaps. \\\"Did you deliver your first training session? What challenges did you face? What resources do you need?\\\"\\n\\n**Monthly Climate Space discussions:** Organic feedback emerges through regular gatherings. When trainers keep hearing \\\"participants ask about X,\\\" that signals something to add.\\n\\n**Employer feedback (from apprenticeship partners):** \\\"Are trainees showing up with the skills we need? What's missing?\\\" This closes loop between training content and market needs.\\n\\n**Bi-annual curriculum reviews (May & Nov gatherings):** \\\"What new materials/techniques should we add? What's outdated? What are participants asking about that we didn't cover?\\\" Trainers gather to update materials\\u2014add new technologies, remove outdated content, incorporate field lessons.\\n\\n**Participant feedback:** From training cohorts taught by ToT graduates. \\\"How was the training? Did the trainer explain clearly? What would you change?\\\"\\n\\n### Curriculum Update Process\\n\\nExample: If multiple trainers report \\\"Participants struggle with U-value calculations,\\\" then:\\n- **Update:** Add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems\\n- **Pilot:** Test in next Anbar ToT cohort\\n- **Assess:** Did it help? If yes \\u2192 keep; if no \\u2192 iterate\\n\\n## ITC's Continuing Role\\n\\n**Short term (2025-2026):** Fund initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad. Support annual showcase event if it happens. Help develop simple digital trainer directory. Facilitate university partnerships.\\n\\n**Medium term (2026-2027):** Transition coordination to Mosul Space. Support government subsidy advocacy if it moves forward. Help develop quality assurance systems. Document case studies for replication in other regions.\\n\\n**Long term (2027+):** Periodic check-ins rather than daily management. Available for troubleshooting but not driving. Opportunities to share model with other Iraqi cities or conflict-affected regions while Mosul community increasingly owns and evolves the work.\\n\\n**My continuing involvement:** Conducting expert interviews when needed for expansions, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which have been enjoyable), building and maintaining digital infrastructure, developing quality assurance and review systems. Depends on funding and what makes sense as things develop.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers, reviewing feedback, and thinking about how communities sustain themselves. The approach leans toward minimal structure\\u2014just enough for people to connect\\u2014while trusting that if training serves people, they'll figure out how to keep it going.\\n\\n**Core ideas:**\\n- Connect with what already exists (Mosul Space's Climate Space) rather than building parallel structures\\n- Recognize natural leadership through quality work and generosity rather than creating formal hierarchies\\n- Create rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep format flexible\\n- Build simple digital infrastructure that evolves based on what proves useful\\n- Explore multiple funding possibilities without engineering a perfect model\\u2014if training creates value, funding will emerge\\n- Root work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend on specific individuals\\n- Consider long-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion (2-3 years, potentially transformational)\\n- Keep learning from practice through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews\\n- Scale only if community is healthy and trainers are succeeding\\u2014quality and authenticity matter more than growth\\n\\nThe ToT sessions (September-October 2025) are a promising beginning to a community of practice that can possibly emerge based on the good will and generosity of the community that showed up. These recommendations are possibilities for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not prescriptions to follow.\\n\", \"filename\": \"/mnt/user-data/outputs/tot-sustainability-plan.md\"}"

            "extracted_content": "Strategic Overview\nThe initial ToT cohorts (September-October 2025) trained 39 people across three modules. The question now is how this continues. Based on trainer feedback, expert interviews, and observing what Mosul Space already does through Climate Space, a few approaches seem possible:\n\nApproach\nWhat It Looks Like\nStrengths\nChallenges\nOrganic Community\nMonthly gatherings at existing Climate Space, natural mentorship, minimal formal structure\nAuthentic, low overhead, builds on what works\nMay lack visibility for scaling, harder to measure\nInstitutional Embedding\nToT becomes part of university continuing education programs\nStable, credible, sustainable funding\nSlower to implement, less flexible\nTrainer Paid / Externally Funded\nTrainers pay for training, gaining access to high quality trainee candidates. Supplemented by grant funding\nSynergistic and mutually beneficial for both trainers and trainees\nIdentifying and applying for further grants, who will take the lead?\n\n\nThis plan suggests a hybrid approach: connect to Climate Space for community building, partner with universities for stability, and add minimal infrastructure (digital directory, quality checks) only where gaps exist.\nIntroduction\nThese recommendations are based on listening to trainers during ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, and interviewing solar and insulation experts. The challenge is creating enough structure that people can connect without imposing so much that it feels bureaucratic.\n\nTrainers emphasized their work is motivated by service—rebuilding Mosul, reducing energy poverty, and protecting the environment. Any continuation needs to honor that rather than replacing it with frameworks.\n11.1 Vision for Continuity\nSustainability happens when something serves people well enough that they want to keep it going, when it becomes part of how the community operates rather than a separate project.\n\nTrainer discussions revealed a deeply engaged and motivated communtiy of generosity. People see their work as service and recognize that \"Actions by their intentions.\" Trainers want to rebuild Mosul, reduce energy poverty, protect the environment… and find and expand their work and find work for the next generation. These are synergies that can be the heartbeat of a community effort to build the sustainable construction and housing community in Mosul. \n11.2 Connecting with Climate Space\nMosul Space has seen emerge from it’s community a locally run sustainability themed effort named Climate Space. They are monthly gatherings where people talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and build community. People show up because these sessions serve them. The green housing training community could connect to these existing gatherings rather than creating separate structures:\n\nA place for trainers and trainees to connect after the end of the ToT\nAdd a \"Green Housing Update\" segment to Climate Space sessions to share what’s been happening with the community and attempts at installations\nUse this time for trainers to share what's working, challenges they face, help they need\nLet mentorship connections form through regular gatherings\nAllow relationships to develop \nThis requires a community manager at our partner organization, Mosul Space, to ensure clear communication and connection with the trainings\n11.3 Recognizing Natural Leadership\nSome trainers will become go-to resources through consistently good training, regular participation, generosity with time and knowledge, and stable institutional connections.\n\nA few trainers demonstrated these qualities during initial ToT sessions:\n\nName\nModule\nStrengths\nInstitution\nDr. Abdulhakim Nabel\nSolar\nUniversity faculty, technical depth\nUniversity of Mosul\nHossam Al-Deen Khalil\nSolar\nCompany owner, practical experience\nAqtab Al-Taqa (solar)\nOmar Laith\nInsulation\nHands-on learning focus, architect\nAl-Rafedyen Architects\nWifaq Ahmed\nInsulation/Heritage\nGovernment subsidy knowledge\nMosul Heritage Foundation\nSaad Salih Dhiab\nInsulation\nUniversity faculty, hosts field visits\nAl-Noor University\n\n\nThese trainers could be invited to operate the trainings, and some may be good candidates to co-facilitate future ToT sessions if interested.\n11.4 Creating Rhythm Through Events\nPeople need some rhythm to stay connected—enough touchpoints for relationships to develop without becoming burdensome.\n\nOne annual event possibility: Green Housing Showcase, bringing together trainers, graduates, employers, suppliers, and policymakers. Elements could include portfolio showcase, design competition finale, informal jobs fair, supplier expo, and recognition awards (best retrofit impact, most innovative design).\n\nPractical approach: combine this with the Output 3.2 Design Competition Finale planned for 2026 rather than creating a separate event. This would reduce costs and complexity.\n\nThis is a suggestion for ITC and Mosul Space to consider. If it doesn't fit, the community will find other ways to celebrate and connect.\n\nMonthly touchpoints through Climate Space gatherings:\n\nGreen Housing update segment (30 minutes)\nTrainers share project stories, challenges, successes\nProblem-solving clinic for stuck situations\nSocial connection over tea\n\nFormat stays flexible—sometimes documentary, sometimes discussion, sometimes hands-on demonstration. The goal is building trust and relationships over time.\n\nPost-training 30-day reunions: 2-hour gatherings (in person or Zoom) where participants share what they've implemented since training. \"Show and tell\" format—people bring photos, describe challenges, get support. Natural opportunity to connect successful graduates with employers or clients.\n11.5 Digital Infrastructure\nAs the community grows, people need ways to find each other—trainers looking for apprentices, clients looking for consultants, graduates looking for mentors, suppliers looking for installers.\n\nSimple starting point: trainer directory using Airtable or Google Sheets with trainer profiles (name, module, location, contact), participant portfolios (photos, testimonials, project descriptions), and supplier list (materials, pricing, contact). Publicly accessible and searchable by module or location. Mosul Space staff updates quarterly.\n\nTrickier question: quality assurance. One idea could be to have trainers and Mosul Staff identify high quality trainees and offer them a marker of distinction on the website. Mosul is a social community and someone’s word of trust matters. This can help participants enter the market and reduce negative opinions towards sustainability (insulation/solar) by preventing problematic installations. \n\nGoal: create trusted signals in a market where they're lacking. Make quality visible and verifiable without bureaucracy.\n\nMore sophisticated systems could come later—AI-powered knowledge bases querying interview transcripts, training materials, case studies. But that's only worth pursuing if simple systems prove valuable first.\n11.6 Funding Sustainability\nITC funding supported initial ToT cohorts. What happens after is an open question.\n\nPotential funding sources to explore: Employer-sponsored training where solar companies send staff to ToT, this already happens informally and is to be explored, what were the expected benefits and did the training provide value we can capitalize on?\n\nUniversity partnerships where ToT is embedded in continuing education programs, with universities providing venues and certification, adding credibility. Dr. Abdulhakim at University of Mosul and Saad Salih at Al-Noor University expressed interest. These opportunities would be interesting to explore with them. \nGrant funding from development agencies like UNDP and GIZ that support green skills training. Government subsidy expansion for insulation materials, which would increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates.\n\n11.7 Government Subsidy Advocacy\nWifaq Ahmed from Mosul Heritage Foundation mentioned: Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials (cement, rebar). Homeowners get money back. She suggested exploring whether this subsidy could expand to insulation materials.\n\nCurrently, insulation is seen asa  luxury rather than an essential. If government subsidy covered 30-50% of insulation costs, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years. Mass adoption becomes economically feasible. Since a current policy framework seems to exist expansion might be politically realistic by adding items to an existing list, not creating new program and Wifaq is aware of this mechanism and one of the most keen and supprortive trainers in the ToT. Additionally Wifaq may be an employee with the ITC in a few months, making this potentially a good job for him to explore. \n\nPossible advocacy approach (2-3 years): Document the case with ToT graduate case studies showing energy savings, health benefits, comfort improvements. Calculate broader impacts: households who could afford insulation, jobs created, reduction in fuel imports. Build coalition including University of Mosul (academic credibility), Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement), private sector suppliers like SIKA and SMTC (who would benefit), and ITC (international reputation, economic development expertise). Run pilot demonstration retrofitting 10-20 homes with ITC or UNDP funding. Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials. Invite government officials to site visits at annual showcase event. Submit policy brief to Ministry of Construction and Housing: subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience, achievable by adding a few items to the existing subsidy list.\n11.9 Learning From Practice\nSimple feedback mechanisms to help training evolve: Post-training surveys (week after ToT) asking what worked, what needs improvement, and whether trainers feel ready. Already being done, insights inform next cohorts. 30-day reunion check-ins to see who's implementing and what challenges they face. Once the trainees are out in the real-world, their implementation can reveals curriculum gaps. \n\nMonthly Climate Space discussions, where organic feedback emerges through regular gatherings. Climate space can be the meeting point for trainers and participants, so when trainers keep hearing \"participants ask about X,\" that signals something to add. Employer feedback from apprenticeship partners about whether graduates show up with needed skills and what's missing. This closes the loop between training content and market needs. Annual curriculum reviews where trainers gather once a year to update materials when we can add new technologies, remove outdated content, and incorporate field lessons.\n11.10 ITC/Bilal’s Continuing Role\nShort term (2025-2026): Fund initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad. Support annual showcase event if it happens. Help develop simple digital trainer directory. Facilitate university partnerships.\n\nMy continuing involvement: conducting expert interviews when needed for expansions, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which have been enjoyable), building and maintaining digital infrastructure, developing quality assurance and review systems. Depends on funding and what makes sense as things develop.\n11.4 Community of Practice Mechanisms\nSustainability isn't just financial — it's about keeping the community engaged between formal trainings.\nWhatsApp Community Groups\nPurpose: Homework assignments, supplier photos, quick Q&A, peer support\nCadence: Daily activity during training cohorts; weekly check-ins between cohorts\nContent shared:\n\"I just visited this supplier — here's their pricing for EPS insulation\"\n\"Client asked about payback period — how do I calculate with rising tariffs?\"\n\"Check out this retrofit project I completed — before/after photos\"\nModeration: 1-2 master trainers + Mosul Space coordinator keep discussions focused\n\nCurrent Status: Active WhatsApp groups already exist for Solar (25 members) and Insulation (14 members) cohorts. Merge into a single \"Green Housing Trainers - Iraq\" group to foster cross-module learning.\n\n\nBi-Annual Trainer Gatherings\nFrequency: Twice per year (May & November)\nFormat: 1-day convening (not full ToT, but refresher + strategy session)\nAgenda:\nMorning: \"How are trainings going?\" (trainers share successes, challenges)\nAfternoon: Curriculum updates (new materials, new techniques, feedback from participants)\nEvening: Social / networking (build relationships, celebrate impact)\nHost: Leverage Mosul Space's \"Climate Space\" existing convening power (they already host quarterly green business events)\n\nCost: 500,000 IQD per gathering (venue, tea, light refreshments) × 2/year = 1,000,000 IQD/year (~$700 USD, absorbable by IP budget)\n\n\nMonthly Reunion (Post-Training Cohorts)\nTiming: 30 days after each training cohort completes\nPurpose: Check-in on real-world implementation\nSolar: \"Did you complete an installation?

How did they react?\"\nFormat: 2-hour session (in-person or Zoom)\nFirst hour: Show & tell (participants share portfolio pieces)\nSecond hour: Problem-solving clinic (troubleshoot challenges)\nOutcome: Builds accountability, surfaces curriculum gaps, creates social proof (\"If they can do it, so can I\")\n\nIntegration with Apprenticeships: This monthly reunion is when trainees present portfolio pieces to potential employers (see Section 9.2 Framework).\n\n\n11.5 Institutional Anchors\nTo avoid \"hero-dependent\" sustainability (where everything collapses if one person leaves), we anchor the ToT model to institutions:\n\nAnchor 1: Mosul Space Organization (Community Convening Power)\nRole: Host ToT sessions, manage WhatsApp groups, coordinate logistics\nExisting Capacity: Mosul Space already runs \"Climate Space\" (quarterly green business events), so green housing ToT fits naturally\nSustainability: Mosul Space has diverse funding (not dependent on one donor), ensuring continuity\n\nAnchor 2: Iraqi Engineering Union (Professional Certification)\nRole: Recognize ToT certification as professional development credit for engineers\nBenefits: Engineers need continuing education credits to maintain licensure — ToT can fulfill this requirement\nNext Step: Explore partnership with Engineering Union via ITC contacts (Lada coordinates)\n11.7 Green Home Festival / Fair (FLAGSHIP RECOMMENDATION)\n\nConcept\nBring together trainers, participants, suppliers, employers, policymakers, homeowners for a 1-day showcase event that:\nRaises awareness about green housing solutions\nShowcases trainee portfolios (before/after photos, ROI calculations, design competition winners)\nConnects trainees with employers (jobs fair component)\nFacilitates matchmaking (mentors ↔ cofounders, suppliers ↔ installers, clients ↔ consultants)\nCelebrates success (awards for best retrofit, most innovative design, community impact)\n\nTiming & Integration\n\nPiggyback on existing BEIT events to minimize costs:\n3.2 Design Competition Finale (200 houses, retrofit product startup, model homes) — happening in 2026\nGreen Home Festival becomes the showcase event for design competition winners + ToT graduate portfolios\nBudget: Add 2-3M IQD (~$1,400-2,000 USD) to existing 3.2 event budget (vs. 10M+ IQD for standalone event)\n\nExpected Outcomes\nVisibility: 200+ attendees (trainers, trainees, employers, policymakers, media)\nJobs: 10-15 trainees matched with employers during event\nAwareness: Social media coverage (each trainee shares photos → 100 trainees × 200 followers = 20,000 reach)\nPolicy momentum: Government officials see market demand → consider subsidy expansion\nCommunity cohesion: \"We're not just isolated trainers — we're part of a movement\"\n\nRecommendation: Allocate budget in 2026 planning; coordinate with 3.2 design competition lead.\n\n11.8 Digital Community Hub (Future Vision)\nConcept\nEvolve the Google Drive materials repository into a digital community hub that serves as:\nTrainer Directory: Profiles with credentials, contact info, specializations \"Need a solar trainer in Anbar? Here are 5 certified trainers with reviews.\"\nParticipant Portfolio Gallery: Showcase trainee work (before/after photos, testimonials) \"Employers: Browse portfolios, hire certified green housing professionals.\"\nSupplier Database: Pricing, specs, contact info for vetted suppliers \"Where can I buy EPS insulation in Mosul? Here are 3 suppliers with datasheets.\"\nQueryable Knowledge Base (RAG System): AI-powered Q&A \"What's the ROI for roof insulation in a 150m² home?\" → system retrieves data from trainer interviews, case studies\nEvent Calendar: Upcoming ToTs, monthly reunions, Green Home Festival\n\nPhase 1 (2026): Simple Directory (Low-Tech)\nPlatform: Airtable or Google Sheets (accessible, no coding required)\nContent: Trainer profiles, participant portfolios (PDF exports), supplier list\nAccess: Public (to maximize visibility), or login-required (if privacy needed)\n\nPhase 2 (2027): Interactive Hub (Medium-Tech)\nPlatform: Custom website (WordPress + database)\nFeatures: Search/filter trainers by module, location; submit portfolio; request mentorship\nMaintenance: Mosul Space designates 1 staff member as \"community manager\" (5-10 hrs/week)\n11.9 Government Subsidy Advocacy (HIGH-IMPACT LEVERAGE POINT)\nThe Opportunity (from Wifaq Ahmed, Mosul Heritage Foundation)\n\"The Iraqi government already has a subsidy program for construction materials,  homeowners can get money back when they buy cement, rebar, etc. We should advocate to expand this subsidy to include insulation materials (EPS, XPS, mineral wool, reflective barriers).\"\n\nWhy This Matters:\nCurrent barrier: Insulation perceived as \"luxury\" (not essential like cement)\nSubsidy changes economics: If government covers 30-50% of insulation cost, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years and promotes mass adoption\nPrecedent exists: Government already subsidizes construction materials, so expansion is politically feasible (not creating new program, just adding items to existing list)\n\nAdvocacy Strategy\nDocument the case (by Dec 2025):\nCompile ToT participant case studies showing ROI of insulation (energy savings, health benefits, comfort)\nCalculate: \"If government subsidized insulation, X households could afford it → Y jobs created → Z reduction in generator fuel imports\"\n\nIdentify decision-makers and Build coalition:\nUniversity of Mosul (academic credibility)\nIraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement)\nPrivate sector (suppliers like SIKA, SMTC benefit → lobby support)\nITC (international reputation, economic development expertise)\n\nPolicy brief submission (2026):\nITC submits formal recommendation to Ministry of Construction\nKey message: \"Subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience — achievable by adding 5 items to existing subsidy list\"\n\nTimeline: 2-3 years (advocacy is slow), but if successful it can have a transformational impact on market demand for insulation and lead to more jobs for BEIT trainees.\n\nITC Role: Leverage relationships with government (existing from other ITC Iraq projects), provide technical analysis, coordinate coalition.\n11.10 Continuous Improvement: Feedback Loops\nSustainability requires ongoing adaptation based on what's working in the field.\nFeedback Mechanisms\nPost-Training Surveys (1 week after ToT) \"What worked? What needs improvement? Are you ready to train?\"\nMonthly Reunion Check-Ins (30 days post-training) \"Did you deliver your first training session? What challenges did you face? What resources do you need?\"\nBi-Annual Curriculum Review (May & Nov gatherings) \"What new materials/techniques should we add? What's outdated? What are participants asking about that we didn't cover?\"\nEmployer Feedback (from apprenticeship partners) \"Are trainees showing up with the skills we need? What's missing?\"\nParticipant Feedback (from training cohorts taught by ToT graduates) \"How was the training? Did the trainer explain clearly? What would you change?\"\n\nCurriculum Update Process: \nExample: If multiple trainers report \"Participants struggle with U-value calculations\", then:\nUpdate: Add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems\nPilot: Test in next Anbar ToT cohort\nAssess: Did it help? If yes → keep; if no → iterate\nConclusion\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers, reviewing feedback, and thinking about how communities sustain themselves. The approach leans toward minimal structure—just enough for people to connect—while trusting that if training serves people, they'll figure out how to keep it going.\n\nCore ideas: Connect with what already exists (Mosul Space's Climate Space) rather than building parallel structures. Recognize natural leadership through quality work and generosity rather than creating formal hierarchies. Create rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep format flexible. Build simple digital infrastructure that evolves based on what proves useful. Explore multiple funding possibilities without engineering a perfect model—if training creates value, funding will emerge. Root work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend on specific individuals. Consider long-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion (2-3 years, potentially transformational). Keep learning from practice through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews. Scale only if community is healthy and trainers are succeeding—quality and authenticity matter more than growth.\n\nThe ToT sessions (September-October 2025) are a promising beginning to a community of practice that can possible emerge based on the good will and generosity of the community that showed up. These recommendations are possibilities for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not prescriptions to follow..\n\n"

The key giveaways from this document include:\n\n1. **Undue emphasis on symbolism and importance** - phrases like \"stands/serves as\", \"is a testament/reminder\", \"plays a vital/significant/crucial role\", \"underscores/highlights its importance/significance\", \"reflects broader\", \"symbolizing its ongoing\", \"enduring/lasting impact\", \"key turning point\", \"indelible mark\", \"deeply rooted\", \"profound heritage\", \"steadfast dedication\"\n\n2. **Emphatic language** - \"paramount\", \"indispensable\", \"pivotal\", \"paramount importance\", \"nothing short of\"\n\n3. **Overly formal/verbose prose** - LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose\n\n4. **Hedging and qualifying phrases** - \"it's important to note that\", \"it's worth noting that\", while/whilst\n\n5. **Vertical lists** - LLMs love making lists\n\n6. **Conjunctions and connecting words in stilted ways**\n\nLooking at the document I need to merge, I can see the voice is actually quite good - it's conversational, direct, and doesn't use those AI-isms. The user wants me to merge their updated top sections with my previous reorganization while avoiding those AI giveaways.\n\nLet me create the merged document carefully, keeping the authentic voice and avoiding those patterns.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood, I've merged the documents and avoided AI writing giveaways. Let me check what I did:\n\n1. I kept the conversational, direct voice throughout\n2. I avoided phrases like \"serves as a testament\", \"plays a crucial role\", \"underscores the importance\", etc.\n3. I didn't use overly emphatic language like \"paramount\" or \"indispensable\"\n4. I kept the format relatively clean without excessive formatting\n5. I preserved the authentic, practical tone of the original\n\nThe user's edits from the second document have been incorporated, particularly:\n- Updated strategic overview table with the \"Trainer Paid / Externally Funded\" approach\n- Updated intro language\n- Updated vision section with the expanded language about synergies\n- Updated Climate Space section with more detail about community management\n- Updated natural leadership section about \"operate the trainings\"\n- Updated quality assurance section with the new approach\n- Updated university partnership language\n- Updated government subsidy section with info about Wifaq potentially joining ITC\n- Removed some of the medium-term and long-term ITC role info, keeping it simpler\n\nThe document now flows well and maintains the authentic voice while avoiding AI writing patterns.[View your merged document](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/tot-sustainability-plan-revised.md)\n\nI've merged your edits with the reorganized version, removing duplications and keeping the voice intact. Your edits about the \"Trainer Paid\" approach, Wifaq potentially joining ITC, and the quality assurance approach are all integrated. The document avoids the AI giveaways—no \"testament to\" language, no \"plays a crucial role\" stuff, no unnecessary emphasis words. Just straight talk about what might work.",

Whether powered by a rotary engine, a V8 swap, or an imagined fighter jet turbine, the Miata remains the canvas for car enthusiasts worldwide.\"\n    39\tLLMs tend to have an identifiable writing style.\n    40\tThis is a list of writing and formatting conventions typical of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, with real examples taken from Wikipedia articles and drafts. It is a field guide to help detect undisclosed AI-generated content on Wikipedia. This list is descriptive, not prescriptive; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the policies and guidelines and the Manual of Style, but does not belong on this page.\n    41\t\n    42\tThis list is not a ban on certain words, phrases, or punctuation. Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated, as the large language models that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of very common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, specific to Wikipedia. While some of its advice may be broadly applicable, some signs—particularly those involving punctuation and formatting—may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.\n    43\t\n    44\tThe patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor wordsmithing, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry much more serious policy risks. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently), those surface defects might not be present, but deeper problems can be. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content and Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide.\n    45\t\n    46\tThe speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which can be found in § Communication intended for the user and the other two in § Citations. The other signs are not sufficient on their own for speedy deletion.\n    47\t\n    48\tDo not solely rely on artificial intelligence content detection tools (such as GPTZero) to evaluate whether text is LLM-generated. While they perform better than random chance, these tools have nontrivial error rates and cannot replace human judgment.[1]\n    49\t\n    50\tContent\n    51\tShortcuts\n    52\tWP:AIWTW\n    53\tWP:AI-ISM\n    54\tLLMs (and artificial neural networks in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to regress to the mean; that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a \"tell\" for detecting AI-generated content.\n    55\t\n    56\tFor example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. Consequently, the LLM tends to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the specific detail \"invented the first train-coupling device\" might become \"a revolutionary titan of industry.\" It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.[2]\n    57\t\n    58\tThis statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements, that could equally apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.\n    59\t\n    60\tUndue emphasis on symbolism and importance\n    61\tWords to watch: stands/serves as / is a testament/reminder, plays a vital/significant/crucial role, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing, enduring/lasting impact, key turning point, indelible mark, deeply rooted, profound heritage, steadfast dedication ...\n    62\tLLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects of the topic represent or contribute to a broader topic.[3] There is a distinct and easily identifiable repertoire of ways that it writes these statements.[4] LLMs may include them for even the most mundane of things, sometimes with hedging preambles like \"While [minor/not well known/etc], it [symbolizes/stands as/contributes]...\"\n    63\t\n    64\tWhen talking about biology (e.g., when asked to discuss a given animal or plant species), LLMs tend to put too much emphasis on the species' conservation status and the efforts to protect it, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist, and may strain to derive symbolism from things like taxonomy.\n    65\t\n    66\tExamples\n    67\t\n\t< truncated lines 68-771 >\n   772\tSpecial:PermanentLink/1292432848#References\n   773\tSpecial:PermanentLink/1291491974#References\n   774\tSpecial:PermanentLink/1291561040#References\n   775\tLinks to searches\n   776\tCategory:Pages with incorrect ref formatting\n   777\tMiscellaneous\n   778\tAbrupt cut offs\n   779\tAI tools may abruptly stop generating content, for example if they predict the end of text sequence (appearing as <|endoftext|>) next. Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited, and further responses require the user to select \"continue generating\".\n   780\t\n   781\tThis method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a copyright violation rather than the use of an LLM.\n   782\t\n   783\tDiscrepancies in writing style and variety of English\n   784\tA sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools.\n   785\t\n   786\tAnother discrepancy is a mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[6] Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.\n   787\t\n   788\tAge of text relative to ChatGPT launch\n   789\tChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not easily accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.\n   790\t\n   791\tIt is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia prior to November 30, 2022 was generated by an LLM. If an edit was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some older text may display some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.\n   792\t\n   793\tOverwhelmingly verbose edit summaries\n   794\tAI-generated edit summaries are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without abbreviations, and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.\n   795\t\n   796\tMost editors using AI do not ask for summaries to be generated.\n   797\t\n   798\tRefined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with Wikipedia's content guidelines. Removed promotional wording, ensured factual accuracy, and maintained a clear, well-structured presentation. Updated sections on history, coverage, challenges, and recognition for clarity and relevance. Added proper formatting and categorized the entry accordingly\n   799\t\n   800\t— Edit summary from this revision to Khaama Press\n   801\tI formalized the tone, clarified technical content, ensured neutrality, and indicated citation needs. Historical narratives were streamlined, allocation details specified with regulatory references, propagation explanations made reader-friendly, and equipment discussions focused on availability and regulatory compliance, all while adhering to encyclopedic standards.\n   802\t\n   803\t— Edit summary from this revision to 4-metre band\n   804\t**Concise edit summary:** Improved clarity, flow, and readability of the plot section; reduced redundancy and refined tone for better encyclopedic style.\n   805\t\n   806\t— Edit summary from this revision to Anaganaga (film)\n   807\t\"Submission statements\" in AFC drafts\n   808\tThis one is specific to drafts submitted by Articles for Creation. At least one LLM tends to insert \"submission statements\" supposedly intended for reviewers that supposedly explain why the subject is notable and why the draft meets Wikipedia guidelines. Of course, all this actually does is let reviewers know that the draft is LLM-generated, and should be declined or speedied without a second thought.\n   809\t\n   810\tReviewer note (for AfC): This draft is a neutral and well-sourced biography of Portuguese public manager Jorge Patrão. All references are from independent, reliable sources (Público, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Negócios, RTP, O Interior, Agência Lusa) covering his public career and cultural activity. It meets WP:RS and WP:BLP standards and demonstrates clear notability per WP:NBIO through: – Presidency of Serra da Estrela Tourism Region (1998–2013); – Presidency of Parkurbis – Covilhã Science and Technology Park; – Founding role in Rede de Judiarias de Portugal (member of the Council of Europe’s European Routes of Jewish Heritage); – Authorship of the book \"1677 – A Fábrica d’El-Rei\"; – Founder/curator of the Beatriz de Luna Art Collection (Old Master focus). There is also a Portuguese version of this article at pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Patrão. Thank you for your review. -->\n   811\t\n   812\t— Found at the top of Draft:Jorge Patrão (all the inevitable formatting errors are present in the original)\n   813\tPre-declined AFC review templates\n   814\tOccasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an AFC review template already set to \"declined\". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like {{AfC submission|d}}, in which the \"d\" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting {{AfC submission/declined}}. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk or one of the other help pages why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free \"submission declined\" header is a strong indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.\n   815\t\n   816\tLinks to searches\n   817\t\n   818\tyou declined your own draft\n   819\tAbnormalities in categories and the \"see also\" section\n   820\tLLM-generated Wikipedia pages often include multiple categories and a see also section, but the pages linked in both cases often don't actually exist. These red links are frequently for generic concepts that seem like plausible Wikipedia article/category titles. Red links in both of these parts of the page are discouraged by Wikipedia's guidelines.\n   821\t\n   822\tPay attention to the blue links in see-also sections as well. LLM-generated \"see also\" sections often tend to fill them up (to at least 3 links) seemingly out of obligation, so if a new page/draft on some startup links to a broad term like Financial technology in its see-also section, that's a bit suspicious.\n   823\t\n   824\tYou may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite Category:Entrepreneurs. Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.\n   825\t\n   826\tOf course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule; new users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections.\n   827\t\n   828\tIneffective indicators\n   829\tFalse accusations of AI use can drive away new editors and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider if Dunning–Kruger effect and confirmation bias is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection—and may even indicate the opposite.\n   830\t\n   831\tPerfect grammar: While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also § Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English.)\n   832\t\"Bland\" or \"robotic\" prose: By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as \"robotic\" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.[9]\n   833\t\"Fancy,\" \"academic,\" or unusual words: While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are long and have difficult readability scores, the correlation does not extend to all \"fancy,\" academic, or \"advanced\"-sounding prose.[1] \"AI vocabulary\" and academic vocabulary are not the same thing; indeed, the specific words overused by AI appeared far less frequently in research abstracts prior to 2023.[4] Low-frequency and \"unusual\" words are also less likely to show up in AI-generated writing as they are statistically less common, unless they are proper nouns directly related to the topic.\n   834\tShortcut\n   835\tWP:AILETTER\n   836\tLetter-like writing (in isolation): Although many talk page messages written with salutations, valedictions and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, that is not guaranteed to be the case for all such messages. Letters and emails have conventionally been written in similar ways long before modern LLMs existed. An AI-generated message may start with a subject line, include a vertical list[f] or one or more placeholders, or end abruptly. In addition, some human editors may mistakenly post emails, letters, petitions, or messages intended for the article's subject, frequently formatted as letters.[g] While such edits are generally off-topic and may be removed per the guidelines at WP:NOTFORUM—particularly if they contain personal information—they are not necessarily LLM-generated.\n   837\tConjunctions (in isolation): While LLMs tend to overuse connecting words and phrases in a stilted, formulaic way that implies inappropriate synthesis of facts, such uses are typical of essay-like writing by humans and are not strong indicators by themselves.\n   838\tBizarre wikitext: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in § Use of Markdown, they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, \"inexplicable\" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in § Markup). Bizarrely placed HTML tags like <span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool (T113137). Misplaced syntax like ''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel. (rendered as \"Catch-22 is a satirical novel.\") are more indicative of mistakes in VisualEditor, where such errors are harder to notice than in source editing.",

It is a field guide to help detect undisclosed AI-generated content on Wikipedia. This list is descriptive, not prescriptive; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the policies and guidelines and the Manual of Style, but does not belong on this page.\\n\\nThis list is not a ban on certain words, phrases, or punctuation. Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated, as the large language models that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of very common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, specific to Wikipedia. While some of its advice may be broadly applicable, some signs\\u2014particularly those involving punctuation and formatting\\u2014may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.\\n\\nThe patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix\\u2014e.g., excessive boldface, poor wordsmithing, broken markup, citation style quirks\\u2014they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry much more serious policy risks. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently), those surface defects might not be present, but deeper problems can be. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at Wikipedia:Large language models \\u00a7 Handling suspected LLM-generated content and Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide.\\n\\nThe speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which can be found in \\u00a7 Communication intended for the user and the other two in \\u00a7 Citations. The other signs are not sufficient on their own for speedy deletion.\\n\\nDo not solely rely on artificial intelligence content detection tools (such as GPTZero) to evaluate whether text is LLM-generated. While they perform better than random chance, these tools have nontrivial error rates and cannot replace human judgment.[1]\\n\\nContent\\nShortcuts\\nWP:AIWTW\\nWP:AI-ISM\\nLLMs (and artificial neural networks in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to regress to the mean; that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a \\\"tell\\\" for detecting AI-generated content.\\n\\nFor example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. Consequently, the LLM tends to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the specific detail \\\"invented the first train-coupling device\\\" might become \\\"a revolutionary titan of industry.\\\" It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.[2]\\n\\nThis statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements, that could equally apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.\\n\\nUndue emphasis on symbolism and importance\\nWords to watch: stands/serves as / is a testament/reminder, plays a vital/significant/crucial role, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing, enduring/lasting impact, key turning point, indelible mark, deeply rooted, profound heritage, steadfast dedication ...\\nLLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects of the topic represent or contribute to a broader topic.[3] There is a distinct and easily identifiable repertoire of ways that it writes these statements.[4] LLMs may include them for even the most mundane of things, sometimes with hedging preambles like \\\"While [minor/not well known/etc], it [symbolizes/stands as/contributes]...\\\"\\n\\nWhen talking about biology (e.g., when asked to discuss a given animal or plant species), LLMs tend to put too much emphasis on the species' conservation status and the efforts to protect it, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist, and may strain to derive symbolism from things like taxonomy.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nBerry Hill today stands as a symbol of community resilience, ecological renewal, and historical continuity.

They may or may not provide additional context as to what those sources have actually said about the subject, and often inaccurately attribute their own superficial analyses to the source.\\n\\nHuman-written press releases have of course also cited news clippings for decades, but LLMs specifically asked to write a Wikipedia article often echo the exact verbiage of Wikipedia's guidelines, such as \\\"independent coverage.\\\"\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nHer achievements and performances have been featured in several Philippine media outlets, including Manila Standard, Philstar.com, Asian Journal, and LionhearTV.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom Draft:Joice Espinoza\\nBarnes has been profiled in multiple national outlets including Forbes, Barron\\u2019s, Fortune and Bloomberg for his contributions to the fintech industry while also being featured as Crain's Chicago Business's \\\"40 Under 40\\\" in 2022.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom Draft:Brian Barnes (entrepreneur)[a]\\nFeatured by Brazilian outlets including Fato Amaz\\u00f4nico, BNCAmazonas, and Em Tempo for his cultural contribution to reggaeton in the North Region, Brazil.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFound in a classic LLM bulleted list, in Draft:Ryan Vasquez (singer)\\nTrade coverage has noted Ascend\\u2019s brand portfolio alongside its financing activity and footprint.

This is often done by attaching a present participle (\\\"-ing\\\") phrase at the end of sentences, sometimes with vague attributions to third parties (see below).[3]\\n\\nWhile many of these words are strong AI tells on their own,[4][5] an even stronger tell is when the subjects of these verbs are facts, events, or other inanimate things. A person, for example, can highlight or emphasize something, but a fact or event cannot. The \\\"highlighting\\\" or \\\"underscoring\\\" is not something that is actually happening; it is a claim by a disembodied narrator about what something means.[3]\\n\\nSuch comments are usually synthesis and/or unattributed opinions in wikivoice. Newer chatbots with retrieval-augmented generation (for example, an AI chatbot that can search the web) may attach these statements to named sources, whether or not the source contains anything close.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nDouera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a dynamic hub of activity and culture.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom this revision to Dou\\u00e9ra\\nThese citations, spanning more than six decades and appearing in recognized academic publications, illustrate Blois' lasting influence in computational linguistics, grammar, and neology.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom this revision to Draft:Jacques Blois (linguist)\\nIn 2025, the Federation was internationally recognized and invited to participate in the Asia Pickleball Summit, highlighting Pakistan\\u2019s entry into the global pickleball community.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom this revision to Draft:Pakistan Pickleball Federation\\nThe civil rights movement emerged as a powerful continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom this revision to African-American culture\\nIts bilingual monument sign, with inscriptions in both English and Spanish, underscores its role in bringing together Latter-day Saints from the United States and Mexico.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom this revision to McAllen Texas Temple\\nPromotional and positively-loaded language\\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch \\u00a7 Puffery.\\nShortcuts\\nWP:AIPUFFERY\\nWP:AIPEACOCK\\nWords to watch: rich/vibrant/diverse tapestry, artistic/cultural/literary/media/etc. landscape, boasts a, continues to captivate, groundbreaking, intricate, stunning natural beauty, enduring/lasting legacy, nestled, in the heart of  ...\\nLLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially when writing about something that could be considered \\\"cultural heritage\\\"\\u2014in which case they constantly remind the reader that it is cultural heritage.

The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range (e.g. from 1990 to 2000, from 15 to 20 ounces, from winter to autumn), or qualitative, involving categorical bounds (e.g. \\\"from seed to tree\\\", \\\"from mild to severe\\\", \\\"from white belt to black belt\\\"). The same constructions may be used to form a merism\\u2014a figure of speech that combines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative meaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable scale: from head to toe (the length of a body denoting the whole body), from soup to nuts (clearly based on time), etc. This is not a false range.\\n\\nLLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply mentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be identified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another scale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a false range. LLMs often employ \\\"figurative\\\" (often simply: meaningless) \\\"from ... to ...\\\" constructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or even unrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred.

As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running on MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like Miraheze, LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data. While the corpora of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: Markdown. Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using it, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia articles look like formatted documents.\\n\\nWhen asked about its \\\"formatting guidelines\\\", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level instructions typically generates some variation of the following (this is Microsoft Copilot in mid-2025):\\n\\n## Formatting Guidelines\\n\\n- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.  \\n- Use a single main title (`#`) and clear primary subheadings (`##`).  \\n- Keep paragraphs short (3\\u20135 sentences, \\u2264150 words).  \\n- Break large topics into labeled subsections.  \\n- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.  \\n- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.  \\n- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.  \\n- Use horizontal dividers (`---`) between major sections.  \\n- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.  \\n- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.  \\n- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.  \\n- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.\\nAs the above suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.\\n\\nEven when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using syntactically correct wikitext, as their training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in Markdown. When told to \\\"generate an article\\\", a chatbot typically defaults to using Markdown for the generated output, which is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might \\\"realize\\\" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (`wikitext`)?[d] in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax is often rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style fenced code block (its syntax for WP:PRE) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: ```wikitext.[e]\\n\\nThe presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like Obsidian and GitHub, and on platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Slack. Some writing tools and apps, such as iOS Notes, Google Docs, and Windows Notepad, support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nSee also: Markdown \\u00a7 Examples\\nI believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** \\u2014 not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being \\u201cunhelpful\\u201d, and a general impression that I am \\\"not here to build an encyclopedia\\\". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments \\\"AI-generated\\\" \\u2014 without explaining how they are substantively flawed.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom this revision to a user talk page\\n- The Wikipedia entry does not explicitly mention the \\\"Cyberhero League\\\" being recognized as a winner of the World Future Society's BetaLaunch Technology competition, as detailed in the interview with THE FUTURIST ([1](https://consciouscreativity.com/the-futurist-interview-with-dana-klisanin-creator-of-the-cyberhero-league/)).

They may also treat ordinary references to topics as categories, thus generating non-existent categories. Note that this is also a common error made by new or returning editors.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n[[Category:American hip hop musicians]]\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom this revision to Draft:Paytra\\nrather than\\n\\n[[Category:American hip-hop musicians]]\\nCitations\\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Fictitious references.\\nShortcut\\nWP:AIFICTREF\\nBroken external links\\nIf a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and several of them are broken (e.g., returning 404 errors), this is a strong sign of an AI-generated page, particularly if the dead links are not found in website archiving sites like Internet Archive or Archive Today. Most links become broken over time, but these factors make it unlikely that the link was ever real.\\n\\nInvalid DOI and ISBNs\\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see Wikipedia:DOI and Wikipedia:ISBN.\\nA checksum can be used to verify ISBNs. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates display a warning if so. Similarly, DOIs are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of hallucinated references.\\n\\nRelated are DOIs that point to entirely unrelated articles and general book citations without pages. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.\\n\\nOhm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1]. Ohm\\u2019s Law applies to many materials and components that are \\\"ohmic,\\\" meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors [2][3].\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n1. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.).

Worse, both Proceedings of the IEEE citations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to completely different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, C. L. Fortescue was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and Vol 55, Issue 11 does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 3.\\n\\nIncorrect or unconventional use of references\\nShortcut\\nWP:AICITESTYLE\\nAI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so as Wikipedia expects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.\\n\\nIn the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.\\n\\nIn this case, the Smith, R. J. source \\u2013 being the \\\"third source\\\" the tool presumably generated the link 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3' (which has a PMID reference of 3) \\u2013 is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{cite journal}} reference, even though the links resolve.\\n\\nThe LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.\\n\\nFor over thirty years, computers have been utilized in the rehabilitation of individuals with brain injuries.

Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited, and further responses require the user to select \\\"continue generating\\\".\\n\\nThis method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a copyright violation rather than the use of an LLM.\\n\\nDiscrepancies in writing style and variety of English\\nA sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools.\\n\\nAnother discrepancy is a mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[6] Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.\\n\\nAge of text relative to ChatGPT launch\\nChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not easily accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.\\n\\nIt is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia prior to November 30, 2022 was generated by an LLM. If an edit was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some older text may display some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.\\n\\nOverwhelmingly verbose edit summaries\\nAI-generated edit summaries are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without abbreviations, and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.\\n\\nMost editors using AI do not ask for summaries to be generated.\\n\\nRefined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with Wikipedia's content guidelines.

At least one LLM tends to insert \\\"submission statements\\\" supposedly intended for reviewers that supposedly explain why the subject is notable and why the draft meets Wikipedia guidelines. Of course, all this actually does is let reviewers know that the draft is LLM-generated, and should be declined or speedied without a second thought.\\n\\nReviewer note (for AfC): This draft is a neutral and well-sourced biography of Portuguese public manager Jorge Patr\\u00e3o. All references are from independent, reliable sources (P\\u00fablico, Di\\u00e1rio de Not\\u00edcias, Jornal de Neg\\u00f3cios, RTP, O Interior, Ag\\u00eancia Lusa) covering his public career and cultural activity. It meets WP:RS and WP:BLP standards and demonstrates clear notability per WP:NBIO through: \\u2013 Presidency of Serra da Estrela Tourism Region (1998\\u20132013); \\u2013 Presidency of Parkurbis \\u2013 Covilh\\u00e3 Science and Technology Park; \\u2013 Founding role in Rede de Judiarias de Portugal (member of the Council of Europe\\u2019s European Routes of Jewish Heritage); \\u2013 Authorship of the book \\\"1677 \\u2013 A F\\u00e1brica d\\u2019El-Rei\\\"; \\u2013 Founder/curator of the Beatriz de Luna Art Collection (Old Master focus). There is also a Portuguese version of this article at pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Patr\\u00e3o. Thank you for your review. -->\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFound at the top of Draft:Jorge Patr\\u00e3o (all the inevitable formatting errors are present in the original)\\nPre-declined AFC review templates\\nOccasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an AFC review template already set to \\\"declined\\\". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like {{AfC submission|d}}, in which the \\\"d\\\" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting {{AfC submission/declined}}. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk or one of the other help pages why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free \\\"submission declined\\\" header is a strong indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.\\n\\nLinks to searches\\n\\nyou declined your own draft\\nAbnormalities in categories and the \\\"see also\\\" section\\nLLM-generated Wikipedia pages often include multiple categories and a see also section, but the pages linked in both cases often don't actually exist. These red links are frequently for generic concepts that seem like plausible Wikipedia article/category titles. Red links in both of these parts of the page are discouraged by Wikipedia's guidelines.\\n\\nPay attention to the blue links in see-also sections as well. LLM-generated \\\"see also\\\" sections often tend to fill them up (to at least 3 links) seemingly out of obligation, so if a new page/draft on some startup links to a broad term like Financial technology in its see-also section, that's a bit suspicious.\\n\\nYou may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite Category:Entrepreneurs. Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.\\n\\nOf course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule; new users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections.\\n\\nIneffective indicators\\nFalse accusations of AI use can drive away new editors and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider if Dunning\\u2013Kruger effect and confirmation bias is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection\\u2014and may even indicate the opposite.\\n\\nPerfect grammar: While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also \\u00a7 Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English.)\\n\\\"Bland\\\" or \\\"robotic\\\" prose: By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as \\\"robotic\\\" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.[9]\\n\\\"Fancy,\\\" \\\"academic,\\\" or unusual words: While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are long and have difficult readability scores, the correlation does not extend to all \\\"fancy,\\\" academic, or \\\"advanced\\\"-sounding prose.[1] \\\"AI vocabulary\\\" and academic vocabulary are not the same thing; indeed, the specific words overused by AI appeared far less frequently in research abstracts prior to 2023.[4] Low-frequency and \\\"unusual\\\" words are also less likely to show up in AI-generated writing as they are statistically less common, unless they are proper nouns directly related to the topic.\\nShortcut\\nWP:AILETTER\\nLetter-like writing (in isolation): Although many talk page messages written with salutations, valedictions and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, that is not guaranteed to be the case for all such messages. Letters and emails have conventionally been written in similar ways long before modern LLMs existed. An AI-generated message may start with a subject line, include a vertical list[f] or one or more placeholders, or end abruptly. In addition, some human editors may mistakenly post emails, letters, petitions, or messages intended for the article's subject, frequently formatted as letters.[g] While such edits are generally off-topic and may be removed per the guidelines at WP:NOTFORUM\\u2014particularly if they contain personal information\\u2014they are not necessarily LLM-generated.\\nConjunctions (in isolation): While LLMs tend to overuse connecting words and phrases in a stilted, formulaic way that implies inappropriate synthesis of facts, such uses are typical of essay-like writing by humans and are not strong indicators by themselves.\\nBizarre wikitext: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in \\u00a7 Use of Markdown, they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, \\\"inexplicable\\\" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in \\u00a7 Markup). Bizarrely placed HTML tags like <span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool (T113137). Misplaced syntax like ''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel. (rendered as \\\"Catch-22 is a satirical novel.\\\") are more indicative of mistakes in VisualEditor, where such errors are harder to notice than in source editing.\", \"filename\": \"/mnt/user-data/uploads/AIWritingGiveawaysToAvoid.txt\"}"

The question now is how this continues. Based on trainer feedback, expert interviews, and observing what Mosul Space already does through Climate Space, a few approaches seem possible:\n\n| Approach | What It Looks Like | Strengths | Challenges |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Organic Community | Monthly gatherings at existing Climate Space, natural mentorship, minimal formal structure | Authentic, low overhead, builds on what works | May lack visibility for scaling, harder to measure |\n| Institutional Embedding | ToT becomes part of university continuing education programs | Stable, credible, sustainable funding | Slower to implement, less flexible |\n| Trainer Paid / Externally Funded | Trainers pay for training, gaining access to high quality trainee candidates. Supplemented by grant funding | Synergistic and mutually beneficial for both trainers and trainees | Identifying and applying for further grants, who will take the lead? |\n\nThis plan suggests a hybrid approach: connect to Climate Space for community building, partner with universities for stability, and add minimal infrastructure (digital directory, quality checks) only where gaps exist.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThese recommendations are based on listening to trainers during ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, and interviewing solar and insulation experts. The challenge is creating enough structure that people can connect without imposing so much that it feels bureaucratic.\n\nTrainers emphasized their work is motivated by service—rebuilding Mosul, reducing energy poverty, and protecting the environment. Any continuation needs to honor that rather than replacing it with frameworks.\n\n## Vision for Continuity\n\nSustainability happens when something serves people well enough that they want to keep it going, when it becomes part of how the community operates rather than a separate project.\n\nTrainer discussions revealed a deeply engaged and motivated community of generosity. People see their work as service and recognize that \"Actions by their intentions.\" Trainers want to rebuild Mosul, reduce energy poverty, protect the environment... and find and expand their work and find work for the next generation. These are synergies that can be the heartbeat of a community effort to build the sustainable construction and housing community in Mosul.\n\n## Community Building\n\n### Connecting with Climate Space\n\nMosul Space has seen emerge from its community a locally run sustainability themed effort named Climate Space. They are monthly gatherings where people talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and build community. People show up because these sessions serve them. The green housing training community could connect to these existing gatherings rather than creating separate structures:\n\n- A place for trainers and trainees to connect after the end of the ToT\n- Add a \"Green Housing Update\" segment to Climate Space sessions to share what's been happening with the community and attempts at installations\n- Use this time for trainers to share what's working, challenges they face, help they need\n- Let mentorship connections form through regular gatherings\n- Allow relationships to develop\n\nThis requires a community manager at our partner organization, Mosul Space, to ensure clear communication and connection with the trainings.\n\n### WhatsApp Community Groups\n\n**Purpose:** Homework assignments, supplier photos, quick Q&A, peer support\n\n**Cadence:** Daily activity during training cohorts; weekly check-ins between cohorts\n\n**Content shared:**\n- \"I just visited this supplier — here's their pricing for EPS insulation\"\n- \"Client asked about payback period — how do I calculate with rising tariffs?\"\n- \"Check out this retrofit project I completed — before/after photos\"\n\n**Moderation:** 1-2 master trainers + Mosul Space coordinator keep discussions focused\n\n**Current Status:** Active WhatsApp groups already exist for Solar (25 members) and Insulation (14 members) cohorts. Merge into a single \"Green Housing Trainers - Iraq\" group to foster cross-module learning.\n\n### Creating Rhythm Through Events\n\nPeople need some rhythm to stay connected—enough touchpoints for relationships to develop without becoming burdensome.\n\n**Monthly touchpoints through Climate Space gatherings:**\n- Green Housing update segment (30 minutes)\n- Trainers share project stories, challenges, successes\n- Problem-solving clinic for stuck situations\n- Social connection over tea\n\nFormat stays flexible—sometimes documentary, sometimes discussion, sometimes hands-on demonstration. The goal is building trust and relationships over time.\n\n**Post-training 30-day reunions:**\n\n**Timing:** 30 days after each training cohort completes\n\n**Purpose:** Check-in on real-world implementation\n- Solar: \"Did you complete an installation? Show photos!\"\n- Insulation: \"Did you assess a home? Calculate savings?\"\n- Architecture: \"Did you present a green design to a client? How did they react?\"\n\n**Format:** 2-hour gatherings (in person or Zoom) where participants share what they've implemented since training. \"Show and tell\" format—people bring photos, describe challenges, get support. Natural opportunity to connect successful graduates with employers or clients.\n\n**Outcome:** Builds accountability, surfaces curriculum gaps, creates social proof (\"If they can do it, so can I\")\n\n**Integration with Apprenticeships:** This monthly reunion is when trainees present portfolio pieces to potential employers.\n\n**Bi-Annual Trainer Gatherings:**\n\n**Frequency:** Twice per year (May & November)\n\n**Format:** 1-day convening (not full ToT, but refresher + strategy session)\n\n**Agenda:**\n- Morning: \"How are trainings going?\" (trainers share successes, challenges)\n- Afternoon: Curriculum updates (new materials, new techniques, feedback from participants)\n- Evening: Social / networking (build relationships, celebrate impact)\n\n**Host:** Leverage Mosul Space's \"Climate Space\" existing convening power (they already host quarterly green business events)\n\n**Cost:** 500,000 IQD per gathering (venue, tea, light refreshments) × 2/year = 1,000,000 IQD/year (~$700 USD, absorbable by IP budget)\n\n### Green Home Festival / Fair (FLAGSHIP RECOMMENDATION)\n\n**Concept:** Bring together trainers, participants, suppliers, employers, policymakers, homeowners for a 1-day showcase event that:\n- Raises awareness about green housing solutions\n- Showcases trainee portfolios (before/after photos, ROI calculations, design competition winners)\n- Connects trainees with employers (jobs fair component)\n- Facilitates matchmaking (mentors ↔ cofounders, suppliers ↔ installers, clients ↔ consultants)\n- Celebrates success (awards for best retrofit, most innovative design, community impact)\n\n**Timing & Integration:** Piggyback on existing BEIT events to minimize costs—the 3.2 Design Competition Finale (200 houses, retrofit product startup, model homes) happening in 2026. Green Home Festival becomes the showcase event for design competition winners + ToT graduate portfolios.\n\n**Budget:** Add 2-3M IQD (~$1,400-2,000 USD) to existing 3.2 event budget (vs. 10M+ IQD for standalone event)\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n- Visibility: 200+ attendees (trainers, trainees, employers, policymakers, media)\n- Jobs: 10-15 trainees matched with employers during event\n- Awareness: Social media coverage (each trainee shares photos → 100 trainees × 200 followers = 20,000 reach)\n- Policy momentum: Government officials see market demand → consider subsidy expansion\n- Community cohesion: \"We're not just isolated trainers — we're part of a movement\"\n\n**Recommendation:** Allocate budget in 2026 planning; coordinate with 3.2 design competition lead.\n\nThis is a suggestion for ITC and Mosul Space to consider. If it doesn't fit, the community will find other ways to celebrate and connect.\n\n## Recognizing Natural Leadership\n\nSome trainers will become go-to resources through consistently good training, regular participation, generosity with time and knowledge, and stable institutional connections.\n\nA few trainers demonstrated these qualities during initial ToT sessions:\n\n| Name | Module | Strengths | Institution |\n|------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n| Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel | Solar | University faculty, technical depth | University of Mosul |\n| Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | Solar | Company owner, practical experience | Aqtab Al-Taqa (solar) |\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | Hands-on learning focus, architect | Al-Rafedyen Architects |\n| Wifaq Ahmed | Insulation/Heritage | Government subsidy knowledge | Mosul Heritage Foundation |\n| Saad Salih Dhiab | Insulation | University faculty, hosts field visits | Al-Noor University |\n\nThese trainers could be invited to operate the trainings, and some may be good candidates to co-facilitate future ToT sessions if interested.\n\n## Digital Infrastructure\n\nAs the community grows, people need ways to find each other—trainers looking for apprentices, clients looking for consultants, graduates looking for mentors, suppliers looking for installers.\n\n### Phase 1 (2026): Simple Directory (Low-Tech)\n\n**Platform:** Airtable or Google Sheets (accessible, no coding required)\n\n**Content:** \n- Trainer profiles (name, module, location, contact)\n- Participant portfolios (photos, testimonials, project descriptions)\n- Supplier list (materials, pricing, contact)\n\n**Access:** Publicly accessible and searchable by module or location. Mosul Space staff updates quarterly.\n\n### Phase 2 (2027): Interactive Hub (Medium-Tech)\n\n**Concept:** Evolve the Google Drive materials repository into a digital community hub that serves as:\n- **Trainer Directory:** Profiles with credentials, contact info, specializations (\"Need a solar trainer in Anbar? Here are 5 certified trainers with reviews.\")\n- **Participant Portfolio Gallery:** Showcase trainee work (before/after photos, testimonials) (\"Employers: Browse portfolios, hire certified green housing professionals.\")\n- **Supplier Database:** Pricing, specs, contact info for vetted suppliers (\"Where can I buy EPS insulation in Mosul? Here are 3 suppliers with datasheets.\")\n- **Queryable Knowledge Base (RAG System):** AI-powered Q&A (\"What's the ROI for roof insulation in a 150m² home?\" → system retrieves data from trainer interviews, case studies)\n- **Event Calendar:** Upcoming ToTs, monthly reunions, Green Home Festival\n\n**Platform:** Custom website (WordPress + database)\n\n**Features:** Search/filter trainers by module, location; submit portfolio; request mentorship\n\n**Maintenance:** Mosul Space designates 1 staff member as \"community manager\" (5-10 hrs/week)\n\n### Quality Assurance\n\nTrickier question: quality assurance. One idea could be to have trainers and Mosul Staff identify high quality trainees and offer them a marker of distinction on the website. Mosul is a social community and someone's word of trust matters. This can help participants enter the market and reduce negative opinions towards sustainability (insulation/solar) by preventing problematic installations.\n\nGoal: create trusted signals in a market where they're lacking. Make quality visible and verifiable without bureaucracy.\n\nMore sophisticated systems could come later, but that's only worth pursuing if simple systems prove valuable first.\n\n## Institutional Anchors\n\nTo avoid \"hero-dependent\" sustainability (where everything collapses if one person leaves), root the work in institutions:\n\n### Mosul Space (Community Convening Power)\n\n**Role:** Host ToT sessions, manage WhatsApp groups, coordinate logistics\n\n**Existing Capacity:** Mosul Space already runs \"Climate Space\" (quarterly green business events), so green housing ToT fits naturally\n\n**Sustainability:** Mosul Space has diverse funding (not dependent on one donor), ensuring continuity\n\n### University of Mosul\n\n**Role:** Academic credibility through partnership with Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel\n\n**Potential:** Embed ToT in continuing education, providing access to facilities and long-term stability. Dr. Abdulhakim expressed interest and these opportunities would be interesting to explore with him.\n\n### Al-Noor University\n\n**Role:** Through Saad Salih Dhiab—offered to host field visits and is interested in formal partnership\n\n**Potential:** Provide training venues and practical learning opportunities. Saad Salih expressed interest and these opportunities would be interesting to explore with him.\n\n### Iraqi Engineering Union (Professional Certification)\n\n**Role:** Recognize ToT certification as professional development credit for engineers\n\n**Benefits:** Engineers need continuing education credits to maintain licensure—ToT can fulfill this requirement\n\n**Next Step:** Explore partnership with Engineering Union via ITC contacts (Lada coordinates)\n\nSimple memorandums of understanding (1-2 pages each) could clarify roles without bureaucracy.\n\n## Funding Sustainability\n\nITC funding supported initial ToT cohorts. What happens after is an open question.\n\n**Potential funding sources to explore:**\n\n**Employer-sponsored training:** Solar companies send staff to ToT—this already happens informally and is to be explored. What were the expected benefits and did the training provide value we can capitalize on?\n\n**University partnerships:** ToT is embedded in continuing education programs, with universities providing venues and certification, adding credibility. Dr. Abdulhakim at University of Mosul and Saad Salih at Al-Noor University expressed interest and these opportunities would be interesting to explore with them.\n\n**Grant funding:** Development agencies like UNDP and GIZ that support green skills training.\n\n**Government subsidy expansion:** For insulation materials, which would increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates.\n\n## Government Subsidy Advocacy\n\nWifaq Ahmed from Mosul Heritage Foundation mentioned: Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials (cement, rebar). Homeowners get money back. She suggested exploring whether this subsidy could expand to insulation materials.\n\nCurrently, insulation is seen as a luxury rather than an essential. If government subsidy covered 30-50% of insulation costs, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years. Mass adoption becomes economically feasible. Since a current policy framework seems to exist expansion might be politically realistic by adding items to an existing list, not creating new program and Wifaq is aware of this mechanism and one of the most keen and supportive trainers in the ToT. Additionally Wifaq may be an employee with the ITC in a few months, making this potentially a good job for him to explore.\n\n### Advocacy Strategy\n\n**Document the case:** Compile ToT graduate case studies showing energy savings, health benefits, comfort improvements. Calculate broader impacts: households who could afford insulation, jobs created, reduction in fuel imports.\n\n**Build coalition:**\n- University of Mosul (academic credibility)\n- Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement)\n- Private sector suppliers like SIKA and SMTC (who would benefit)\n- ITC (international reputation, economic development expertise)\n\n**Run pilot:** Demonstration retrofitting 10-20 homes with ITC or UNDP funding. Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials. Invite government officials to site visits at annual showcase event.\n\n**Policy brief submission:** Submit to Ministry of Construction and Housing: subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience, achievable by adding a few items to the existing subsidy list.\n\n**Timeline:** 2-3 years (advocacy is slow), but if successful, potentially transformational impact on market demand for insulation.\n\n## Learning From Practice\n\nSustainability requires ongoing adaptation based on what's working in the field.\n\n### Feedback Mechanisms\n\n**Post-training surveys (week after ToT):** \"What worked? What needs improvement? Are you ready to train?\" Already being done, insights inform next cohorts.\n\n**30-day reunion check-ins:** See who's implementing and what challenges they face. Once the trainees are out in the real-world, their implementation can reveal curriculum gaps. \"Did you deliver your first training session? What challenges did you face? What resources do you need?\"\n\n**Monthly Climate Space discussions:** Organic feedback emerges through regular gatherings. Climate space can be the meeting point for trainers and participants, so when trainers keep hearing \"participants ask about X,\" that signals something to add.\n\n**Employer feedback (from apprenticeship partners):** \"Are trainees showing up with the skills we need? What's missing?\" This closes the loop between training content and market needs.\n\n**Bi-annual curriculum reviews (May & Nov gatherings):** \"What new materials/techniques should we add? What's outdated? What are participants asking about that we didn't cover?\" Trainers gather to update materials when we can add new technologies, remove outdated content, and incorporate field lessons.\n\n**Participant feedback:** From training cohorts taught by ToT graduates. \"How was the training? Did the trainer explain clearly? What would you change?\"\n\n### Curriculum Update Process\n\nExample: If multiple trainers report \"Participants struggle with U-value calculations,\" then:\n- **Update:** Add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems\n- **Pilot:** Test in next Anbar ToT cohort\n- **Assess:** Did it help? If yes → keep; if no → iterate\n\n## ITC/Bilal's Continuing Role\n\n**Short term (2025-2026):** Fund initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad. Support annual showcase event if it happens. Help develop simple digital trainer directory. Facilitate university partnerships.\n\n**My continuing involvement:** Conducting expert interviews when needed for expansions, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which have been enjoyable), building and maintaining digital infrastructure, developing quality assurance and review systems. Depends on funding and what makes sense as things develop.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers, reviewing feedback, and thinking about how communities sustain themselves. The approach leans toward minimal structure—just enough for people to connect—while trusting that if training serves people, they'll figure out how to keep it going.\n\n**Core ideas:** Connect with what already exists (Mosul Space's Climate Space) rather than building parallel structures. Recognize natural leadership through quality work and generosity rather than creating formal hierarchies. Create rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep format flexible. Build simple digital infrastructure that evolves based on what proves useful. Explore multiple funding possibilities without engineering a perfect model—if training creates value, funding will emerge. Root work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend on specific individuals. Consider long-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion (2-3 years, potentially transformational). Keep learning from practice through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews. Scale only if community is healthy and trainers are succeeding—quality and authenticity matter more than growth.\n\nThe ToT sessions (September-October 2025) are a promising beginning to a community of practice that can possibly emerge based on the good will and generosity of the community that showed up. These recommendations are possibilities for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not prescriptions to follow.\n",

The question now is how this continues. Based on trainer feedback, expert interviews, and observing what Mosul Space already does through Climate Space, a few approaches seem possible:\\n\\n| Approach | What It Looks Like | Strengths | Challenges |\\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|------------|\\n| Organic Community | Monthly gatherings at existing Climate Space, natural mentorship, minimal formal structure | Authentic, low overhead, builds on what works | May lack visibility for scaling, harder to measure |\\n| Institutional Embedding | ToT becomes part of university continuing education programs | Stable, credible, sustainable funding | Slower to implement, less flexible |\\n| Trainer Paid / Externally Funded | Trainers pay for training, gaining access to high quality trainee candidates. Supplemented by grant funding | Synergistic and mutually beneficial for both trainers and trainees | Identifying and applying for further grants, who will take the lead? |\\n\\nThis plan suggests a hybrid approach: connect to Climate Space for community building, partner with universities for stability, and add minimal infrastructure (digital directory, quality checks) only where gaps exist.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThese recommendations are based on listening to trainers during ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, and interviewing solar and insulation experts. The challenge is creating enough structure that people can connect without imposing so much that it feels bureaucratic.\\n\\nTrainers emphasized their work is motivated by service\\u2014rebuilding Mosul, reducing energy poverty, and protecting the environment. Any continuation needs to honor that rather than replacing it with frameworks.\\n\\n## Vision for Continuity\\n\\nSustainability happens when something serves people well enough that they want to keep it going, when it becomes part of how the community operates rather than a separate project.\\n\\nTrainer discussions revealed a deeply engaged and motivated community of generosity. People see their work as service and recognize that \\\"Actions by their intentions.\\\" Trainers want to rebuild Mosul, reduce energy poverty, protect the environment... and find and expand their work and find work for the next generation. These are synergies that can be the heartbeat of a community effort to build the sustainable construction and housing community in Mosul.\\n\\n## Community Building\\n\\n### Connecting with Climate Space\\n\\nMosul Space has seen emerge from its community a locally run sustainability themed effort named Climate Space. They are monthly gatherings where people talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and build community. People show up because these sessions serve them. The green housing training community could connect to these existing gatherings rather than creating separate structures:\\n\\n- A place for trainers and trainees to connect after the end of the ToT\\n- Add a \\\"Green Housing Update\\\" segment to Climate Space sessions to share what's been happening with the community and attempts at installations\\n- Use this time for trainers to share what's working, challenges they face, help they need\\n- Let mentorship connections form through regular gatherings\\n- Allow relationships to develop\\n\\nThis requires a community manager at our partner organization, Mosul Space, to ensure clear communication and connection with the trainings.\\n\\n### WhatsApp Community Groups\\n\\n**Purpose:** Homework assignments, supplier photos, quick Q&A, peer support\\n\\n**Cadence:** Daily activity during training cohorts; weekly check-ins between cohorts\\n\\n**Content shared:**\\n- \\\"I just visited this supplier \\u2014 here's their pricing for EPS insulation\\\"\\n- \\\"Client asked about payback period \\u2014 how do I calculate with rising tariffs?\\\"\\n- \\\"Check out this retrofit project I completed \\u2014 before/after photos\\\"\\n\\n**Moderation:** 1-2 master trainers + Mosul Space coordinator keep discussions focused\\n\\n**Current Status:** Active WhatsApp groups already exist for Solar (25 members) and Insulation (14 members) cohorts. Merge into a single \\\"Green Housing Trainers - Iraq\\\" group to foster cross-module learning.\\n\\n### Creating Rhythm Through Events\\n\\nPeople need some rhythm to stay connected\\u2014enough touchpoints for relationships to develop without becoming burdensome.\\n\\n**Monthly touchpoints through Climate Space gatherings:**\\n- Green Housing update segment (30 minutes)\\n- Trainers share project stories, challenges, successes\\n- Problem-solving clinic for stuck situations\\n- Social connection over tea\\n\\nFormat stays flexible\\u2014sometimes documentary, sometimes discussion, sometimes hands-on demonstration. The goal is building trust and relationships over time.\\n\\n**Post-training 30-day reunions:**\\n\\n**Timing:** 30 days after each training cohort completes\\n\\n**Purpose:** Check-in on real-world implementation\\n- Solar: \\\"Did you complete an installation? Show photos!\\\"\\n- Insulation: \\\"Did you assess a home? Calculate savings?\\\"\\n- Architecture: \\\"Did you present a green design to a client? How did they react?\\\"\\n\\n**Format:** 2-hour gatherings (in person or Zoom) where participants share what they've implemented since training. \\\"Show and tell\\\" format\\u2014people bring photos, describe challenges, get support. Natural opportunity to connect successful graduates with employers or clients.\\n\\n**Outcome:** Builds accountability, surfaces curriculum gaps, creates social proof (\\\"If they can do it, so can I\\\")\\n\\n**Integration with Apprenticeships:** This monthly reunion is when trainees present portfolio pieces to potential employers.\\n\\n**Bi-Annual Trainer Gatherings:**\\n\\n**Frequency:** Twice per year (May & November)\\n\\n**Format:** 1-day convening (not full ToT, but refresher + strategy session)\\n\\n**Agenda:**\\n- Morning: \\\"How are trainings going?\\\" (trainers share successes, challenges)\\n- Afternoon: Curriculum updates (new materials, new techniques, feedback from participants)\\n- Evening: Social / networking (build relationships, celebrate impact)\\n\\n**Host:** Leverage Mosul Space's \\\"Climate Space\\\" existing convening power (they already host quarterly green business events)\\n\\n**Cost:** 500,000 IQD per gathering (venue, tea, light refreshments) \\u00d7 2/year = 1,000,000 IQD/year (~$700 USD, absorbable by IP budget)\\n\\n### Green Home Festival / Fair (FLAGSHIP RECOMMENDATION)\\n\\n**Concept:** Bring together trainers, participants, suppliers, employers, policymakers, homeowners for a 1-day showcase event that:\\n- Raises awareness about green housing solutions\\n- Showcases trainee portfolios (before/after photos, ROI calculations, design competition winners)\\n- Connects trainees with employers (jobs fair component)\\n- Facilitates matchmaking (mentors \\u2194 cofounders, suppliers \\u2194 installers, clients \\u2194 consultants)\\n- Celebrates success (awards for best retrofit, most innovative design, community impact)\\n\\n**Timing & Integration:** Piggyback on existing BEIT events to minimize costs\\u2014the 3.2 Design Competition Finale (200 houses, retrofit product startup, model homes) happening in 2026. Green Home Festival becomes the showcase event for design competition winners + ToT graduate portfolios.\\n\\n**Budget:** Add 2-3M IQD (~$1,400-2,000 USD) to existing 3.2 event budget (vs. 10M+ IQD for standalone event)\\n\\n**Expected Outcomes:**\\n- Visibility: 200+ attendees (trainers, trainees, employers, policymakers, media)\\n- Jobs: 10-15 trainees matched with employers during event\\n- Awareness: Social media coverage (each trainee shares photos \\u2192 100 trainees \\u00d7 200 followers = 20,000 reach)\\n- Policy momentum: Government officials see market demand \\u2192 consider subsidy expansion\\n- Community cohesion: \\\"We're not just isolated trainers \\u2014 we're part of a movement\\\"\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Allocate budget in 2026 planning; coordinate with 3.2 design competition lead.\\n\\nThis is a suggestion for ITC and Mosul Space to consider. If it doesn't fit, the community will find other ways to celebrate and connect.\\n\\n## Recognizing Natural Leadership\\n\\nSome trainers will become go-to resources through consistently good training, regular participation, generosity with time and knowledge, and stable institutional connections.\\n\\nA few trainers demonstrated these qualities during initial ToT sessions:\\n\\n| Name | Module | Strengths | Institution |\\n|------|--------|-----------|-------------|\\n| Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel | Solar | University faculty, technical depth | University of Mosul |\\n| Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | Solar | Company owner, practical experience | Aqtab Al-Taqa (solar) |\\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | Hands-on learning focus, architect | Al-Rafedyen Architects |\\n| Wifaq Ahmed | Insulation/Heritage | Government subsidy knowledge | Mosul Heritage Foundation |\\n| Saad Salih Dhiab | Insulation | University faculty, hosts field visits | Al-Noor University |\\n\\nThese trainers could be invited to operate the trainings, and some may be good candidates to co-facilitate future ToT sessions if interested.\\n\\n## Digital Infrastructure\\n\\nAs the community grows, people need ways to find each other\\u2014trainers looking for apprentices, clients looking for consultants, graduates looking for mentors, suppliers looking for installers.\\n\\n### Phase 1 (2026): Simple Directory (Low-Tech)\\n\\n**Platform:** Airtable or Google Sheets (accessible, no coding required)\\n\\n**Content:** \\n- Trainer profiles (name, module, location, contact)\\n- Participant portfolios (photos, testimonials, project descriptions)\\n- Supplier list (materials, pricing, contact)\\n\\n**Access:** Publicly accessible and searchable by module or location.

What are participants asking about that we didn't cover?\\\" Trainers gather to update materials when we can add new technologies, remove outdated content, and incorporate field lessons.\\n\\n**Participant feedback:** From training cohorts taught by ToT graduates. \\\"How was the training? Did the trainer explain clearly? What would you change?\\\"\\n\\n### Curriculum Update Process\\n\\nExample: If multiple trainers report \\\"Participants struggle with U-value calculations,\\\" then:\\n- **Update:** Add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems\\n- **Pilot:** Test in next Anbar ToT cohort\\n- **Assess:** Did it help? If yes \\u2192 keep; if no \\u2192 iterate\\n\\n## ITC/Bilal's Continuing Role\\n\\n**Short term (2025-2026):** Fund initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad. Support annual showcase event if it happens. Help develop simple digital trainer directory. Facilitate university partnerships.\\n\\n**My continuing involvement:** Conducting expert interviews when needed for expansions, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which have been enjoyable), building and maintaining digital infrastructure, developing quality assurance and review systems. Depends on funding and what makes sense as things develop.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers, reviewing feedback, and thinking about how communities sustain themselves. The approach leans toward minimal structure\\u2014just enough for people to connect\\u2014while trusting that if training serves people, they'll figure out how to keep it going.\\n\\n**Core ideas:** Connect with what already exists (Mosul Space's Climate Space) rather than building parallel structures. Recognize natural leadership through quality work and generosity rather than creating formal hierarchies. Create rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep format flexible. Build simple digital infrastructure that evolves based on what proves useful. Explore multiple funding possibilities without engineering a perfect model\\u2014if training creates value, funding will emerge. Root work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend on specific individuals. Consider long-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion (2-3 years, potentially transformational). Keep learning from practice through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews. Scale only if community is healthy and trainers are succeeding\\u2014quality and authenticity matter more than growth.\\n\\nThe ToT sessions (September-October 2025) are a promising beginning to a community of practice that can possibly emerge based on the good will and generosity of the community that showed up. These recommendations are possibilities for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not prescriptions to follow.\\n\", \"filename\": \"/mnt/user-data/outputs/tot-sustainability-plan-revised.md\"}"

              "file_text": "# Strategic Plan for ToT Continuity\n\n## Strategic Overview\n\nThe initial ToT cohorts (September-October 2025) trained 39 people across three modules. The question now is how this continues. Based on trainer feedback, expert interviews, and observing what Mosul Space already does through Climate Space, a few approaches seem possible:\n\n| Approach | What It Looks Like | Strengths | Challenges |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Organic Community | Monthly gatherings at existing Climate Space, natural mentorship, minimal formal structure | Authentic, low overhead, builds on what works | May lack visibility for scaling, harder to measure |\n| Institutional Embedding | ToT becomes part of university continuing education programs | Stable, credible, sustainable funding | Slower to implement, less flexible |\n| Trainer Paid / Externally Funded | Trainers pay for training, gaining access to high quality trainee candidates. Supplemented by grant funding | Synergistic and mutually beneficial for both trainers and trainees | Identifying and applying for further grants, who will take the lead? |\n\nThis plan suggests a hybrid approach: connect to Climate Space for community building, partner with universities for stability, and add minimal infrastructure (digital directory, quality checks) only where gaps exist.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThese recommendations are based on listening to trainers during ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, and interviewing solar and insulation experts. The challenge is creating enough structure that people can connect without imposing so much that it feels bureaucratic.\n\nTrainers emphasized their work is motivated by service: rebuilding Mosul, reducing energy poverty, and protecting the environment. Any continuation needs to honor that rather than replacing it with frameworks.\n\n## Vision for Continuity\n\nSustainability happens when something serves people well enough that they want to keep it going, when it becomes part of how the community operates rather than a separate project.\n\nTrainer discussions revealed a deeply engaged and motivated community of generosity. People see their work as service and recognize that \"Actions by their intentions.\" Trainers want to rebuild Mosul, reduce energy poverty, protect the environment... and find and expand their work and find work for the next generation. These are synergies that can be the heartbeat of a community effort to build the sustainable construction and housing community in Mosul.\n\n## Community Building\n\n### Connecting with Climate Space\n\nMosul Space has seen emerge from its community a locally run sustainability themed effort named Climate Space. They are monthly gatherings where people talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and build community. People show up because these sessions serve them. The green housing training community could connect to these existing gatherings rather than creating separate structures:\n\n- A place for trainers and trainees to connect after the end of the ToT\n- Add a \"Green Housing Update\" segment to Climate Space sessions to share what's been happening with the community and attempts at installations\n- Use this time for trainers to share what's working, challenges they face, help they need\n- Let mentorship connections form through regular gatherings\n- Allow relationships to develop\n\nThis requires a community manager at our partner organization, Mosul Space, to ensure clear communication and connection with the trainings.\n\n### WhatsApp Community Groups\n\n**Purpose:** Homework assignments, supplier photos, quick Q&A, peer support\n\n**Cadence:** Daily activity during training cohorts; weekly check-ins between cohorts\n\n**Content shared:**\n- \"I just visited this supplier. Here's their pricing for EPS insulation\"\n- \"Client asked about payback period. How do I calculate with rising tariffs?\"\n- \"Check out this retrofit project I completed. Before/after photos\"\n\n**Moderation:** 1-2 master trainers + Mosul Space coordinator keep discussions focused\n\n**Current Status:** Active WhatsApp groups already exist for Solar (25 members) and Insulation (14 members) cohorts. Merge into a single \"Green Housing Trainers - Iraq\" group to foster cross-module learning.\n\n### Creating Rhythm Through Events\n\nPeople need some rhythm to stay connected. Enough touchpoints for relationships to develop without becoming burdensome.\n\n**Monthly touchpoints through Climate Space gatherings**\n\nGreen Housing update segment (30 minutes). Trainers share project stories, challenges, successes. Problem-solving clinic for stuck situations. Social connection over tea.\n\nFormat stays flexible. Sometimes documentary, sometimes discussion, sometimes hands-on demonstration. The goal is building trust and relationships over time.\n\n**Post-training 30-day reunions**\n\n**Timing:** 30 days after each training cohort completes\n\n**Purpose:** Check-in on real-world implementation\n- Solar: \"Did you complete an installation? Show photos!\"\n- Insulation: \"Did you assess a home? Calculate savings?\"\n- Architecture: \"Did you present a green design to a client? How did they react?\"\n\n**Format:** 2-hour session (in-person or Zoom)\n- First hour: Show & tell (participants share portfolio pieces)\n- Second hour: Problem-solving clinic (troubleshoot challenges)\n\n**Outcome:** Builds accountability, surfaces curriculum gaps, creates social proof (\"If they can do it, so can I\")\n\n**Integration with Apprenticeships:** This monthly reunion is when trainees present portfolio pieces to potential employers.\n\n**Bi-Annual Trainer Gatherings**\n\n**Frequency:** Twice per year (May & November)\n\n**Format:** 1-day convening (not full ToT, but refresher + strategy session)\n\n**Agenda:**\n- Morning: \"How are trainings going?\" (trainers share successes, challenges)\n- Afternoon: Curriculum updates (new materials, new techniques, feedback from participants)\n- Evening: Social / networking (build relationships, celebrate impact)\n\n**Host:** Leverage Mosul Space's \"Climate Space\" existing convening power (they already host quarterly green business events)\n\n**Cost:** 500,000 IQD per gathering (venue, tea, light refreshments) × 2/year = 1,000,000 IQD/year (~$700 USD, absorbable by IP budget)\n\n### Green Home Festival / Fair (FLAGSHIP RECOMMENDATION)\n\n**Concept**\n\nBring together trainers, participants, suppliers, employers, policymakers, homeowners for a 1-day showcase event that:\n- Raises awareness about green housing solutions\n- Showcases trainee portfolios (before/after photos, ROI calculations, design competition winners)\n- Connects trainees with employers (jobs fair component)\n- Facilitates matchmaking (mentors ↔ cofounders, suppliers ↔ installers, clients ↔ consultants)\n- Celebrates success (awards for best retrofit, most innovative design, community impact)\n\n**Timing & Integration**\n\nPiggyback on existing BEIT events to minimize costs:\n- 3.2 Design Competition Finale (200 houses, retrofit product startup, model homes) happening in 2026\n- Green Home Festival becomes the showcase event for design competition winners + ToT graduate portfolios\n- Budget: Add 2-3M IQD (~$1,400-2,000 USD) to existing 3.2 event budget (vs. 10M+ IQD for standalone event)\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n- Visibility: 200+ attendees (trainers, trainees, employers, policymakers, media)\n- Jobs: 10-15 trainees matched with employers during event\n- Awareness: Social media coverage (each trainee shares photos → 100 trainees × 200 followers = 20,000 reach)\n- Policy momentum: Government officials see market demand, consider subsidy expansion\n- Community cohesion: \"We're not just isolated trainers. We're part of a movement\"\n\n**Recommendation:** Allocate budget in 2026 planning; coordinate with 3.2 design competition lead.\n\nThis is a suggestion for ITC and Mosul Space to consider. If it doesn't fit, the community will find other ways to celebrate and connect.\n\n## Recognizing Natural Leadership\n\nSome trainers will become go-to resources through consistently good training, regular participation, generosity with time and knowledge, and stable institutional connections.\n\nA few trainers demonstrated these qualities during initial ToT sessions:\n\n| Name | Module | Strengths | Institution |\n|------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n| Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel | Solar | University faculty, technical depth | University of Mosul |\n| Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | Solar | Company owner, practical experience | Aqtab Al-Taqa (solar) |\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | Hands-on learning focus, architect | Al-Rafedyen Architects |\n| Wifaq Ahmed | Insulation/Heritage | Government subsidy knowledge | Mosul Heritage Foundation |\n| Saad Salih Dhiab | Insulation | University faculty, hosts field visits | Al-Noor University |\n\nThese trainers could be invited to operate the trainings, and some may be good candidates to co-facilitate future ToT sessions if interested.\n\n## Digital Infrastructure\n\nAs the community grows, people need ways to find each other. Trainers looking for apprentices, clients looking for consultants, graduates looking for mentors, suppliers looking for installers.\n\n### Phase 1 (2026): Simple Directory (Low-Tech)\n\n**Platform:** Airtable or Google Sheets (accessible, no coding required)\n\n**Content:** \n- Trainer profiles (name, module, location, contact)\n- Participant portfolios (photos, testimonials, project descriptions)\n- Supplier list (materials, pricing, contact)\n\n**Access:** Publicly accessible and searchable by module or location. Mosul Space staff updates quarterly.\n\n### Phase 2 (2027): Interactive Hub (Medium-Tech)\n\n**Concept:** Evolve the Google Drive materials repository into a digital community hub that serves as:\n\n**Trainer Directory:** Profiles with credentials, contact info, specializations. \"Need a solar trainer in Anbar? Here are 5 certified trainers with reviews.\"\n\n**Participant Portfolio Gallery:** Showcase trainee work (before/after photos, testimonials). \"Employers: Browse portfolios, hire certified green housing professionals.\"\n\n**Supplier Database:** Pricing, specs, contact info for vetted suppliers. \"Where can I buy EPS insulation in Mosul? Here are 3 suppliers with datasheets.\"\n\n**Queryable Knowledge Base (RAG System):** AI-powered Q&A. \"What's the ROI for roof insulation in a 150m² home?\" The system retrieves data from trainer interviews, case studies.\n\n**Event Calendar:** Upcoming ToTs, monthly reunions, Green Home Festival\n\n**Platform:** Custom website (WordPress + database)\n\n**Features:** Search/filter trainers by module, location; submit portfolio; request mentorship\n\n**Maintenance:** Mosul Space designates 1 staff member as \"community manager\" (5-10 hrs/week)\n\n### Quality Assurance\n\nTrickier question: quality assurance. One idea could be to have trainers and Mosul Staff identify high quality trainees and offer them a marker of distinction on the website. Mosul is a social community and someone's word of trust matters. This can help participants enter the market and reduce negative opinions towards sustainability (insulation/solar) by preventing problematic installations.\n\nGoal: create trusted signals in a market where they're lacking. Make quality visible and verifiable without bureaucracy.\n\nMore sophisticated systems could come later, but that's only worth pursuing if simple systems prove valuable first.\n\n## Institutional Anchors\n\nTo avoid \"hero-dependent\" sustainability (where everything collapses if one person leaves), root the work in institutions:\n\n### Mosul Space (Community Convening Power)\n\n**Role:** Host ToT sessions, manage WhatsApp groups, coordinate logistics\n\n**Existing Capacity:** Mosul Space already runs \"Climate Space\" (quarterly green business events), so green housing ToT fits naturally\n\n**Sustainability:** Mosul Space has diverse funding (not dependent on one donor), ensuring continuity\n\n### University of Mosul\n\n**Role:** Academic credibility through partnership with Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel\n\n**Potential:** Embed ToT in continuing education, providing access to facilities and long-term stability. Dr. Abdulhakim expressed interest and these opportunities would be interesting to explore with him.\n\n### Al-Noor University\n\n**Role:** Through Saad Salih Dhiab, who offered to host field visits and is interested in formal partnership\n\n**Potential:** Provide training venues and practical learning opportunities. Saad Salih expressed interest and these opportunities would be interesting to explore with him.\n\n### Iraqi Engineering Union (Professional Certification)\n\n**Role:** Recognize ToT certification as professional development credit for engineers\n\n**Benefits:** Engineers need continuing education credits to maintain licensure. ToT can fulfill this requirement.\n\n**Next Step:** Explore partnership with Engineering Union via ITC contacts (Lada coordinates)\n\nSimple memorandums of understanding (1-2 pages each) could clarify roles without bureaucracy.\n\n## Funding Sustainability\n\nITC funding supported initial ToT cohorts. What happens after is an open question.\n\n**Potential funding sources to explore:**\n\n**Employer-sponsored training:** Solar companies send staff to ToT. This already happens informally and is to be explored. What were the expected benefits and did the training provide value we can capitalize on?\n\n**University partnerships:** ToT is embedded in continuing education programs, with universities providing venues and certification, adding credibility. Dr. Abdulhakim at University of Mosul and Saad Salih at Al-Noor University expressed interest and these opportunities would be interesting to explore with them.\n\n**Grant funding:** Development agencies like UNDP and GIZ that support green skills training.\n\n**Government subsidy expansion:** For insulation materials, which would increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates.\n\n## Government Subsidy Advocacy\n\nWifaq Ahmed from Mosul Heritage Foundation mentioned: Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials (cement, rebar). Homeowners get money back. She suggested exploring whether this subsidy could expand to insulation materials.\n\nCurrently, insulation is seen as a luxury rather than an essential. If government subsidy covered 30-50% of insulation costs, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years. Mass adoption becomes economically feasible. Since a current policy framework seems to exist expansion might be politically realistic by adding items to an existing list, not creating new program and Wifaq is aware of this mechanism and one of the most keen and supportive trainers in the ToT. Additionally Wifaq may be an employee with the ITC in a few months, making this potentially a good job for him to explore.\n\n### Advocacy Strategy\n\n**Document the case (by Dec 2025):**\n- Compile ToT participant case studies showing ROI of insulation (energy savings, health benefits, comfort)\n- Calculate: \"If government subsidized insulation, X households could afford it → Y jobs created → Z reduction in generator fuel imports\"\n\n**Identify decision-makers and Build coalition:**\n- University of Mosul (academic credibility)\n- Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement)\n- Private sector (suppliers like SIKA, SMTC benefit, lobby support)\n- ITC (international reputation, economic development expertise)\n\n**Run pilot:** Demonstration retrofitting 10-20 homes with ITC or UNDP funding. Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials. Invite government officials to site visits at annual showcase event.\n\n**Policy brief submission (2026):**\n- ITC submits formal recommendation to Ministry of Construction\n- Key message: \"Subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience. Achievable by adding 5 items to existing subsidy list\"\n\n**Timeline:** 2-3 years (advocacy is slow), but if successful it can have a transformational impact on market demand for insulation and lead to more jobs for BEIT trainees.\n\n**ITC Role:** Leverage relationships with government (existing from other ITC Iraq projects), provide technical analysis, coordinate coalition.\n\n## Learning From Practice\n\nSustainability requires ongoing adaptation based on what's working in the field.\n\n### Feedback Mechanisms\n\n**Post-Training Surveys (1 week after ToT):** \"What worked? What needs improvement? Are you ready to train?\"\n\n**Monthly Reunion Check-Ins (30 days post-training):** \"Did you deliver your first training session? What challenges did you face? What resources do you need?\"\n\n**Bi-Annual Curriculum Review (May & Nov gatherings):** \"What new materials/techniques should we add? What's outdated? What are participants asking about that we didn't cover?\"\n\n**Employer Feedback (from apprenticeship partners):** \"Are trainees showing up with the skills we need? What's missing?\"\n\n**Participant Feedback (from training cohorts taught by ToT graduates):** \"How was the training? Did the trainer explain clearly? What would you change?\"\n\nAlready being done (feedback forms attached). Insights inform next cohorts. 30-day reunion check-ins see who's implementing and what challenges they face. Once the trainees are out in the real-world, their implementation can reveal curriculum gaps.\n\nMonthly Climate Space discussions let organic feedback emerge through regular gatherings. Climate space can be the meeting point for trainers and participants, so when trainers keep hearing \"participants ask about X,\" that signals something to add. Employer feedback from apprenticeship partners about whether graduates show up with needed skills and what's missing. This closes the loop between training content and market needs. Annual curriculum reviews where trainers gather once a year to update materials when we can add new technologies, remove outdated content, and incorporate field lessons.\n\n### Curriculum Update Process\n\nExample: If multiple trainers report \"Participants struggle with U-value calculations\", then:\n- **Update:** Add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems\n- **Pilot:** Test in next Anbar ToT cohort\n- **Assess:** Did it help? If yes, keep; if no, iterate\n\n## ITC/Bilal's Continuing Role\n\n**Short term (2025-2026):** Fund initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad. Support annual showcase event if it happens. Help develop simple digital trainer directory. Facilitate university partnerships.\n\n**My continuing involvement:** Conducting expert interviews when needed for expansions, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which have been enjoyable), building and maintaining digital infrastructure, developing quality assurance and review systems. Depends on funding and what makes sense as things develop.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers, reviewing feedback, and thinking about how communities sustain themselves. The approach leans toward minimal structure. Just enough for people to connect, while trusting that if training serves people, they'll figure out how to keep it going.\n\nCore ideas: Connect with what already exists (Mosul Space's Climate Space) rather than building parallel structures. Recognize natural leadership through quality work and generosity rather than creating formal hierarchies. Create rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep format flexible. Build simple digital infrastructure that evolves based on what proves useful. Explore multiple funding possibilities without engineering a perfect model. If training creates value, funding will emerge. Root work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend on specific individuals. Consider long-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion (2-3 years, potentially transformational). Keep learning from practice through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews. Scale only if community is healthy and trainers are succeeding. Quality and authenticity matter more than growth.\n\nThe ToT sessions (September-October 2025) are a promising beginning to a community of practice that can possibly emerge based on the good will and generosity of the community that showed up. These recommendations are possibilities for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not prescriptions to follow.\n",

The question now is how this continues. Based on trainer feedback, expert interviews, and observing what Mosul Space already does through Climate Space, a few approaches seem possible:\\n\\n| Approach | What It Looks Like | Strengths | Challenges |\\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|------------|\\n| Organic Community | Monthly gatherings at existing Climate Space, natural mentorship, minimal formal structure | Authentic, low overhead, builds on what works | May lack visibility for scaling, harder to measure |\\n| Institutional Embedding | ToT becomes part of university continuing education programs | Stable, credible, sustainable funding | Slower to implement, less flexible |\\n| Trainer Paid / Externally Funded | Trainers pay for training, gaining access to high quality trainee candidates. Supplemented by grant funding | Synergistic and mutually beneficial for both trainers and trainees | Identifying and applying for further grants, who will take the lead? |\\n\\nThis plan suggests a hybrid approach: connect to Climate Space for community building, partner with universities for stability, and add minimal infrastructure (digital directory, quality checks) only where gaps exist.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThese recommendations are based on listening to trainers during ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, and interviewing solar and insulation experts. The challenge is creating enough structure that people can connect without imposing so much that it feels bureaucratic.\\n\\nTrainers emphasized their work is motivated by service: rebuilding Mosul, reducing energy poverty, and protecting the environment. Any continuation needs to honor that rather than replacing it with frameworks.\\n\\n## Vision for Continuity\\n\\nSustainability happens when something serves people well enough that they want to keep it going, when it becomes part of how the community operates rather than a separate project.\\n\\nTrainer discussions revealed a deeply engaged and motivated community of generosity. People see their work as service and recognize that \\\"Actions by their intentions.\\\" Trainers want to rebuild Mosul, reduce energy poverty, protect the environment... and find and expand their work and find work for the next generation. These are synergies that can be the heartbeat of a community effort to build the sustainable construction and housing community in Mosul.\\n\\n## Community Building\\n\\n### Connecting with Climate Space\\n\\nMosul Space has seen emerge from its community a locally run sustainability themed effort named Climate Space. They are monthly gatherings where people talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and build community. People show up because these sessions serve them. The green housing training community could connect to these existing gatherings rather than creating separate structures:\\n\\n- A place for trainers and trainees to connect after the end of the ToT\\n- Add a \\\"Green Housing Update\\\" segment to Climate Space sessions to share what's been happening with the community and attempts at installations\\n- Use this time for trainers to share what's working, challenges they face, help they need\\n- Let mentorship connections form through regular gatherings\\n- Allow relationships to develop\\n\\nThis requires a community manager at our partner organization, Mosul Space, to ensure clear communication and connection with the trainings.\\n\\n### WhatsApp Community Groups\\n\\n**Purpose:** Homework assignments, supplier photos, quick Q&A, peer support\\n\\n**Cadence:** Daily activity during training cohorts; weekly check-ins between cohorts\\n\\n**Content shared:**\\n- \\\"I just visited this supplier. Here's their pricing for EPS insulation\\\"\\n- \\\"Client asked about payback period. How do I calculate with rising tariffs?\\\"\\n- \\\"Check out this retrofit project I completed. Before/after photos\\\"\\n\\n**Moderation:** 1-2 master trainers + Mosul Space coordinator keep discussions focused\\n\\n**Current Status:** Active WhatsApp groups already exist for Solar (25 members) and Insulation (14 members) cohorts. Merge into a single \\\"Green Housing Trainers - Iraq\\\" group to foster cross-module learning.\\n\\n### Creating Rhythm Through Events\\n\\nPeople need some rhythm to stay connected. Enough touchpoints for relationships to develop without becoming burdensome.\\n\\n**Monthly touchpoints through Climate Space gatherings**\\n\\nGreen Housing update segment (30 minutes). Trainers share project stories, challenges, successes. Problem-solving clinic for stuck situations. Social connection over tea.\\n\\nFormat stays flexible. Sometimes documentary, sometimes discussion, sometimes hands-on demonstration. The goal is building trust and relationships over time.\\n\\n**Post-training 30-day reunions**\\n\\n**Timing:** 30 days after each training cohort completes\\n\\n**Purpose:** Check-in on real-world implementation\\n- Solar: \\\"Did you complete an installation? Show photos!\\\"\\n- Insulation: \\\"Did you assess a home? Calculate savings?\\\"\\n- Architecture: \\\"Did you present a green design to a client? How did they react?\\\"\\n\\n**Format:** 2-hour session (in-person or Zoom)\\n- First hour: Show & tell (participants share portfolio pieces)\\n- Second hour: Problem-solving clinic (troubleshoot challenges)\\n\\n**Outcome:** Builds accountability, surfaces curriculum gaps, creates social proof (\\\"If they can do it, so can I\\\")\\n\\n**Integration with Apprenticeships:** This monthly reunion is when trainees present portfolio pieces to potential employers.\\n\\n**Bi-Annual Trainer Gatherings**\\n\\n**Frequency:** Twice per year (May & November)\\n\\n**Format:** 1-day convening (not full ToT, but refresher + strategy session)\\n\\n**Agenda:**\\n- Morning: \\\"How are trainings going?\\\" (trainers share successes, challenges)\\n- Afternoon: Curriculum updates (new materials, new techniques, feedback from participants)\\n- Evening: Social / networking (build relationships, celebrate impact)\\n\\n**Host:** Leverage Mosul Space's \\\"Climate Space\\\" existing convening power (they already host quarterly green business events)\\n\\n**Cost:** 500,000 IQD per gathering (venue, tea, light refreshments) \\u00d7 2/year = 1,000,000 IQD/year (~$700 USD, absorbable by IP budget)\\n\\n### Green Home Festival / Fair (FLAGSHIP RECOMMENDATION)\\n\\n**Concept**\\n\\nBring together trainers, participants, suppliers, employers, policymakers, homeowners for a 1-day showcase event that:\\n- Raises awareness about green housing solutions\\n- Showcases trainee portfolios (before/after photos, ROI calculations, design competition winners)\\n- Connects trainees with employers (jobs fair component)\\n- Facilitates matchmaking (mentors \\u2194 cofounders, suppliers \\u2194 installers, clients \\u2194 consultants)\\n- Celebrates success (awards for best retrofit, most innovative design, community impact)\\n\\n**Timing & Integration**\\n\\nPiggyback on existing BEIT events to minimize costs:\\n- 3.2 Design Competition Finale (200 houses, retrofit product startup, model homes) happening in 2026\\n- Green Home Festival becomes the showcase event for design competition winners + ToT graduate portfolios\\n- Budget: Add 2-3M IQD (~$1,400-2,000 USD) to existing 3.2 event budget (vs. 10M+ IQD for standalone event)\\n\\n**Expected Outcomes**\\n- Visibility: 200+ attendees (trainers, trainees, employers, policymakers, media)\\n- Jobs: 10-15 trainees matched with employers during event\\n- Awareness: Social media coverage (each trainee shares photos \\u2192 100 trainees \\u00d7 200 followers = 20,000 reach)\\n- Policy momentum: Government officials see market demand, consider subsidy expansion\\n- Community cohesion: \\\"We're not just isolated trainers. We're part of a movement\\\"\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Allocate budget in 2026 planning; coordinate with 3.2 design competition lead.\\n\\nThis is a suggestion for ITC and Mosul Space to consider. If it doesn't fit, the community will find other ways to celebrate and connect.\\n\\n## Recognizing Natural Leadership\\n\\nSome trainers will become go-to resources through consistently good training, regular participation, generosity with time and knowledge, and stable institutional connections.\\n\\nA few trainers demonstrated these qualities during initial ToT sessions:\\n\\n| Name | Module | Strengths | Institution |\\n|------|--------|-----------|-------------|\\n| Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel | Solar | University faculty, technical depth | University of Mosul |\\n| Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | Solar | Company owner, practical experience | Aqtab Al-Taqa (solar) |\\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | Hands-on learning focus, architect | Al-Rafedyen Architects |\\n| Wifaq Ahmed | Insulation/Heritage | Government subsidy knowledge | Mosul Heritage Foundation |\\n| Saad Salih Dhiab | Insulation | University faculty, hosts field visits | Al-Noor University |\\n\\nThese trainers could be invited to operate the trainings, and some may be good candidates to co-facilitate future ToT sessions if interested.\\n\\n## Digital Infrastructure\\n\\nAs the community grows, people need ways to find each other. Trainers looking for apprentices, clients looking for consultants, graduates looking for mentors, suppliers looking for installers.\\n\\n### Phase 1 (2026): Simple Directory (Low-Tech)\\n\\n**Platform:** Airtable or Google Sheets (accessible, no coding required)\\n\\n**Content:** \\n- Trainer profiles (name, module, location, contact)\\n- Participant portfolios (photos, testimonials, project descriptions)\\n- Supplier list (materials, pricing, contact)\\n\\n**Access:** Publicly accessible and searchable by module or location. Mosul Space staff updates quarterly.\\n\\n### Phase 2 (2027): Interactive Hub (Medium-Tech)\\n\\n**Concept:** Evolve the Google Drive materials repository into a digital community hub that serves as:\\n\\n**Trainer Directory:** Profiles with credentials, contact info, specializations. \\\"Need a solar trainer in Anbar? Here are 5 certified trainers with reviews.\\\"\\n\\n**Participant Portfolio Gallery:** Showcase trainee work (before/after photos, testimonials). \\\"Employers: Browse portfolios, hire certified green housing professionals.\\\"\\n\\n**Supplier Database:** Pricing, specs, contact info for vetted suppliers. \\\"Where can I buy EPS insulation in Mosul? Here are 3 suppliers with datasheets.\\\"\\n\\n**Queryable Knowledge Base (RAG System):** AI-powered Q&A. \\\"What's the ROI for roof insulation in a 150m\\u00b2 home?\\\" The system retrieves data from trainer interviews, case studies.\\n\\n**Event Calendar:** Upcoming ToTs, monthly reunions, Green Home Festival\\n\\n**Platform:** Custom website (WordPress + database)\\n\\n**Features:** Search/filter trainers by module, location; submit portfolio; request mentorship\\n\\n**Maintenance:** Mosul Space designates 1 staff member as \\\"community manager\\\" (5-10 hrs/week)\\n\\n### Quality Assurance\\n\\nTrickier question: quality assurance. One idea could be to have trainers and Mosul Staff identify high quality trainees and offer them a marker of distinction on the website. Mosul is a social community and someone's word of trust matters. This can help participants enter the market and reduce negative opinions towards sustainability (insulation/solar) by preventing problematic installations.\\n\\nGoal: create trusted signals in a market where they're lacking. Make quality visible and verifiable without bureaucracy.\\n\\nMore sophisticated systems could come later, but that's only worth pursuing if simple systems prove valuable first.\\n\\n## Institutional Anchors\\n\\nTo avoid \\\"hero-dependent\\\" sustainability (where everything collapses if one person leaves), root the work in institutions:\\n\\n### Mosul Space (Community Convening Power)\\n\\n**Role:** Host ToT sessions, manage WhatsApp groups, coordinate logistics\\n\\n**Existing Capacity:** Mosul Space already runs \\\"Climate Space\\\" (quarterly green business events), so green housing ToT fits naturally\\n\\n**Sustainability:** Mosul Space has diverse funding (not dependent on one donor), ensuring continuity\\n\\n### University of Mosul\\n\\n**Role:** Academic credibility through partnership with Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel\\n\\n**Potential:** Embed ToT in continuing education, providing access to facilities and long-term stability. Dr. Abdulhakim expressed interest and these opportunities would be interesting to explore with him.\\n\\n### Al-Noor University\\n\\n**Role:** Through Saad Salih Dhiab, who offered to host field visits and is interested in formal partnership\\n\\n**Potential:** Provide training venues and practical learning opportunities. Saad Salih expressed interest and these opportunities would be interesting to explore with him.\\n\\n### Iraqi Engineering Union (Professional Certification)\\n\\n**Role:** Recognize ToT certification as professional development credit for engineers\\n\\n**Benefits:** Engineers need continuing education credits to maintain licensure. ToT can fulfill this requirement.\\n\\n**Next Step:** Explore partnership with Engineering Union via ITC contacts (Lada coordinates)\\n\\nSimple memorandums of understanding (1-2 pages each) could clarify roles without bureaucracy.\\n\\n## Funding Sustainability\\n\\nITC funding supported initial ToT cohorts. What happens after is an open question.\\n\\n**Potential funding sources to explore:**\\n\\n**Employer-sponsored training:** Solar companies send staff to ToT. This already happens informally and is to be explored. What were the expected benefits and did the training provide value we can capitalize on?\\n\\n**University partnerships:** ToT is embedded in continuing education programs, with universities providing venues and certification, adding credibility. Dr. Abdulhakim at University of Mosul and Saad Salih at Al-Noor University expressed interest and these opportunities would be interesting to explore with them.\\n\\n**Grant funding:** Development agencies like UNDP and GIZ that support green skills training.\\n\\n**Government subsidy expansion:** For insulation materials, which would increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates.\\n\\n## Government Subsidy Advocacy\\n\\nWifaq Ahmed from Mosul Heritage Foundation mentioned: Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials (cement, rebar). Homeowners get money back. She suggested exploring whether this subsidy could expand to insulation materials.\\n\\nCurrently, insulation is seen as a luxury rather than an essential. If government subsidy covered 30-50% of insulation costs, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years. Mass adoption becomes economically feasible. Since a current policy framework seems to exist expansion might be politically realistic by adding items to an existing list, not creating new program and Wifaq is aware of this mechanism and one of the most keen and supportive trainers in the ToT. Additionally Wifaq may be an employee with the ITC in a few months, making this potentially a good job for him to explore.\\n\\n### Advocacy Strategy\\n\\n**Document the case (by Dec 2025):**\\n- Compile ToT participant case studies showing ROI of insulation (energy savings, health benefits, comfort)\\n- Calculate: \\\"If government subsidized insulation, X households could afford it \\u2192 Y jobs created \\u2192 Z reduction in generator fuel imports\\\"\\n\\n**Identify decision-makers and Build coalition:**\\n- University of Mosul (academic credibility)\\n- Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement)\\n- Private sector (suppliers like SIKA, SMTC benefit, lobby support)\\n- ITC (international reputation, economic development expertise)\\n\\n**Run pilot:** Demonstration retrofitting 10-20 homes with ITC or UNDP funding. Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials. Invite government officials to site visits at annual showcase event.\\n\\n**Policy brief submission (2026):**\\n- ITC submits formal recommendation to Ministry of Construction\\n- Key message: \\\"Subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience. Achievable by adding 5 items to existing subsidy list\\\"\\n\\n**Timeline:** 2-3 years (advocacy is slow), but if successful it can have a transformational impact on market demand for insulation and lead to more jobs for BEIT trainees.\\n\\n**ITC Role:** Leverage relationships with government (existing from other ITC Iraq projects), provide technical analysis, coordinate coalition.\\n\\n## Learning From Practice\\n\\nSustainability requires ongoing adaptation based on what's working in the field.\\n\\n### Feedback Mechanisms\\n\\n**Post-Training Surveys (1 week after ToT):** \\\"What worked? What needs improvement? Are you ready to train?\\\"\\n\\n**Monthly Reunion Check-Ins (30 days post-training):** \\\"Did you deliver your first training session? What challenges did you face? What resources do you need?\\\"\\n\\n**Bi-Annual Curriculum Review (May & Nov gatherings):** \\\"What new materials/techniques should we add? What's outdated? What are participants asking about that we didn't cover?\\\"\\n\\n**Employer Feedback (from apprenticeship partners):** \\\"Are trainees showing up with the skills we need?

Annual curriculum reviews where trainers gather once a year to update materials when we can add new technologies, remove outdated content, and incorporate field lessons.\\n\\n### Curriculum Update Process\\n\\nExample: If multiple trainers report \\\"Participants struggle with U-value calculations\\\", then:\\n- **Update:** Add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems\\n- **Pilot:** Test in next Anbar ToT cohort\\n- **Assess:** Did it help? If yes, keep; if no, iterate\\n\\n## ITC/Bilal's Continuing Role\\n\\n**Short term (2025-2026):** Fund initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad. Support annual showcase event if it happens. Help develop simple digital trainer directory. Facilitate university partnerships.\\n\\n**My continuing involvement:** Conducting expert interviews when needed for expansions, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which have been enjoyable), building and maintaining digital infrastructure, developing quality assurance and review systems. Depends on funding and what makes sense as things develop.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers, reviewing feedback, and thinking about how communities sustain themselves.
