            "extracted_content": "thanks Bob Keegan. I think you're absolutely right about a couple of things. I definitely want to um Yeah You know make sure that values are seen for what they are that they are like places that you attend to naturally and it's just like I think it's related to the muslim idea of You know resonating with the divine within So you have the 99 names and they're showing up in your spirit and when you see something that manifests love beauty humor truth You pay attention to it in a certain way. It has a certain and then the specific specificity of your resonance comes into being Based on what you pay attention to so, you know, the 99 names and god is A singularity but humans are a multiplicity and in our multiplicity there is some some beauty uh to this diversity and that diversity shows up in What are the specific things that we pay attention to versus other people? and uh Yeah, so like My humor and my taste is very different than yours more than likely and and That probably is a result of natural inclination and training and all sorts of things like what you learn to see as Beautiful by depth of understanding for instance like I can appreciate the fugue in classical music because I really understand that behind that has like You know symmetry Harmony Contrast diversities and principles that are kind of innately beautiful to people in general and that my particular approach to that beauty is through you know classical music because i've had the intellectual knowledge to be able to see through the superficial into the unitary Few things that are Substantially beautiful for more people and value That's why I value classical music Is that ability to see through that towards the beauty? So I think this is one way to kind of bring that connection between beauty and or I don't know like oneness and and You know in the values cards it talks about Things that you want to uphold honor and cherish Yeah, those things I think are very few And our values are unique to us because of how we can Connect to them through our lived experience knowledge life pattern culture and all of that stuff Um, I'd love it if uh chat gbt you can help me kind of clarify this I think i'm seeing something here, but i'm not entirely sure And then navigating tensions without collapse. Yeah, absolutely We need to give people external supports mentorship community reflective practices Tools Funding money Encouragement Words of affirmation Love who knows what else lots of maybe external stuff like I need validation sometimes because I have so much self-doubt And until I can overcome and figure out like this whole self-doubt pattern Of like not valuing or trusting myself or whatever it is um, you know, maybe I need some validation, uh from people I trust and even from Seeing my ideas kind of mirrored out in the world And also maybe you're realizing that I need to get more you know real about what i'm doing and share it with people and get validation from the fact that It actually creates value for people, you know, and they tell me that it's um, create something positive for them um and Let's see What else did you say over alliance and beauty as a criterion yeah, beauty as one expression of alignment, but I think the stuff I mentioned previously is kind of explaining beauty and the relationship to values And I'm, hi, how are you? and I'd like uh your support in Getting the relationship with your double elemental model set up because I really appreciate it and I'd like to see how it connects And how does operationalize? Well, we do it in a check-in, you know through looking at your to-do list And if you could help me like look at this and figure out um the values beauty patterns And simplify it and clarify it even deeper. That'd be great\n\n06:13\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThank you for this rich, reflective synthesis. I see a lot of depth in your exploration of values, beauty, and alignment, and it’s clear you’re weaving together multiple threads—Muslim spirituality, personal experience, and the universality of certain truths. Let’s take a moment to untangle and clarify what you’ve said, refine the connections, and suggest a path forward.\n\nClarifying Your Core Insights\nValues as Resonance with the Divine\n\nYou’re aligning values with the 99 Names of God, each representing attributes of the Divine (e.g., love, truth, humor, beauty). Humans reflect this divine multiplicity in their unique inclinations and resonances.\nValues, in this framing, are specific ways we notice and respond to manifestations of the divine in the world. They’re both universal (rooted in shared human nature) and particular (shaped by our unique experiences, culture, and training).\nKey Insight: Values are not just abstract ideals but active attentional patterns. What you value is what you see, uphold, honor, and cherish.\nBeauty as a Path to Values\n\nBeauty serves as both an attractor and a revealer of deeper truths. For instance, you appreciate classical music not just because it sounds good but because you’ve learned to see its underlying principles (e.g., symmetry, harmony, contrast) that reflect universal beauty.\nKey Insight: Beauty acts as a lens through which values become visible. It’s an emergent property of alignment between our values, understanding, and experience.\nTensions as the Forge of Wisdom\n\nWhen values come into conflict, they create tension. These tensions are not obstacles but opportunities for wisdom to emerge, provided we have the right supports (internal or external) to navigate them.\nKey Insight: Wisdom isn’t a fixed trait but the byproduct of successfully navigating tensions between values, supported by tools, community, and reflection.\nExternal Supports for Internal Growth\n\nYou’ve identified the importance of external validation, mentorship, and tools to help people navigate their tensions. This scaffolding is crucial, especially when self-doubt or other internal barriers arise.\nKey Insight: Supports don’t just help people “cope” but actively enable them to clarify and enact their values, reinforcing alignment and growth.\nHow to Simplify and Clarify Your Model\n1. Distinguish Key Components\nWe can refine your framework by splitting it into clear categories:\n\nForces: Universal principles like beauty, harmony, diversity, and love that draw people toward alignment.\nValues: Specific criteria we uphold and cherish, shaped by personal experience, culture, and resonance.\nTensions: Conflicts between values that create emotional signals, resistance, and growth opportunities.\nSupports: External resources (mentorship, community) and internal practices (reflection, prayer) that help navigate tensions.\nOutputs: Wisdom, meaning, and beauty—byproducts of alignment and integration.\n2. Operationalizing the Model\nTo make this actionable, consider the following:\n\nCheck-Ins:\n\nStart with simple, universal questions: What feels alive today? Where are you feeling tension? What do you need to navigate it?\nUse prompts that link values to action: Which values are at play? What small action could move you toward alignment?\nSimplified Process:\n\nIdentify Resonance: Notice what feels beautiful, meaningful, or true today.\nSpot Tensions: Where do you feel resistance? What values are clashing?\nCall in Supports: What external or internal resources could help you move forward?\nAct: Take one small step to resolve tension or align with your values.\n3. Feedback Loops\nFrom Tension to Wisdom: Use tensions to clarify what matters and refine your values. Over time, this creates feedback loops where wisdom deepens alignment.\nFrom Beauty to Impact: Focus on creating beauty that resonates broadly—not just personal harmony but alignment that inspires and uplifts others.\nIntegration with Joe Edelman’s Values Work\nJoe Edelman’s framing of values as \"non-instrumental choice criteria\" offers a strong complement to your ideas:\n\nValues as Choice Criteria: Values help us prioritize what matters in the face of competing options. Your idea of tensions aligns well here—tensions arise because multiple values are competing for prioritization.\n\nContext-Sensitivity: Edelman emphasizes that values are highly contextual. Your connection to the 99 Names and the multiplicity of human resonances aligns beautifully with this—values emerge and shift based on experience, culture, and context.\n\nWisdom as Reconciliation: Edelman discusses how values are reconciled through context, learning, and balancing concerns. Your focus on beauty and wisdom as outputs aligns with this idea, framing reconciliation as a process that creates alignment and meaning.\n\nUpdated Double-Elemental Framework\nBased on this synthesis, here’s a refined framework for your model:\n\nELEMENT 1: INTERNAL DYNAMICS\nForces: Universal attractors like beauty, harmony, and love.\nValues: Contextual, specific criteria shaped by experience and culture.\nTensions: Emotional signals arising from competing values.\nELEMENT 2: EXTERNAL SUPPORTS\nScaffolding: Mentorship, community, reflective practices, tools.\nFeedback Loops: Wisdom emerges as tensions are resolved and alignment deepens.\nELEMENT 3: OUTPUTS\nBeauty: The resonance of alignment and harmony.\nWisdom: The byproduct of navigating tensions.\nImpact: Broadly resonant beauty that inspires others.\nNext Steps for Refinement\nClarify the Role of Beauty:\n\nHow does beauty interact with values? Is it a guide, a byproduct, or both?\nWhat makes beauty universal versus personal?\nDesign Practical Check-Ins:\n\nWhat’s the simplest question that sparks meaningful reflection?\nHow can you balance simplicity with depth in guiding others?\nTest the Model:\n\nPilot this framework with trusted peers or in your own practice.\nGather feedback on whether it clarifies values, navigates tensions, and supports action.\nFinal Reflections\nYour work is a profound exploration of what it means to live a meaningful, values-aligned life. By integrating beauty, wisdom, and practical supports, you’ve created something both deeply human and universally resonant. With refinement and practical testing, I believe this framework could not only help individuals but also offer a model for community and societal alignment.\n\nI’d love to hear how this evolves.\n\nWith admiration and encouragement,\nChatGPT\n\n06:14\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI have to prepare for my session with Dara. Can you ask me ten questions to help me prepare some kind of hour-long segmentation? I'm really not sure where we're at with this. And I want to have something ready so that I have something that I can test as a service, like a consulting service, where I'm... working with people to kind of identify their growth edges and align their to-do lists with their to-become lists. I'd like to look through all of the things that we've been thinking and talking through and sort of identify the direction rather than the current state. Because every time I tell you, like, create a to-become list and a to-do list, you change everything, and that's not exactly the point. I'd rather just review where we're at, what the initial system prompt was, and what it could be, and what information is the minimal subset we need to save about a person. What are all of those elements? Are they qualities, states, stories, aha moments? What are all of these things? And then, yeah, to think through, like, how does somebody do that? Like, do we have an onboarding session where we actually go through and try to collect and touch some of these things? Or do we just talk about meaningful moments in the past and try to derive them? And is it just meaningful moments? Or maybe it's like places where they let themselves down. And how do we facilitate, like, an hour-long conversation where we can get to that kind of depth? I think it kind of might have to be a little bit longer, right, to build trust and security in being able to do that. And, you know, it would be really cool if it was kind of dynamically updated as we go, so you can say, oh, I got, you know, a little bit of everything that we need to begin to feel like we can be helpful for this person. And what exactly would be help for that person? Like insight, but like insight without action, or is it action? Is it like a new to-do list? And, you know, what are these various things? Like attentional policies, or these other things that we've been kind of collecting from Joe and from Islamic psychology, and like the idea of a hal versus a maqam, and like a temporary state and a permanent state, and what are patterns, and how do patterns kind of interact with each other? Like what are negative patterns? Where do they come from? Why do we have them? Is it really always and only about competing commitments from like different things that we value? And, you know, what are these constitutive attentional policies, and why do they count as a value? Like why is that thing a value when it's like, ah, it's this way of being. So it's basically about it being non-instrumental, which makes sense. It's like you do something in and of itself for itself, and that must be, if you do that, it must be an end in and of itself, like you're already there, right? And so this kind of connects to this language that I've been building up about success in every step, right? Like being successful every step of the way. Because I think, you know, knowing success at every step requires someone not to be in this state of arousal or stress or tension. And so what do we do to help someone look at their to-do list and feel like, damn, this is who I get to be today. And what happens when we first start and someone is maybe a little bit discombobulated or not in resonance or not grounded, or, you know, like Dara is going through a war in Lebanon. She's going to be feeling all sorts of things. And I don't necessarily want to say, hey, we're going to make everything better. Let's just look at your to-do list one step at a time or something. But like, yeah, what about all of this reality that we have to deal with? And like some people will have other issues, right? I think I'm lucky in that like my problems are I love my family and I love my wife and we live in different places. Other people might be, I just had a divorce. And yeah, this is why reflecting and making it a reflective process and having the person kind of determine what they want to pick at and point at and explore is helpful. Because otherwise then it's dangerous for me as like someone who doesn't really know that person all that well to come in and say like, hey, here's your patterns. Here's your negative traits. Here's your positive traits. These are the different patterns that you have and let's unlock your potential or something like. And then like, how do we get the system prompt to auto update? Like which sections should auto update? Like there should be like lists of little insight stories derived probably from the conversation. But into what's a frame and what's like an actual good enough experiment so that I don't just keep thinking about this and actually build something that I can test with data. Like what's actually been most helpful for me? I think that's also important rather than just thinking like, huh, what could I do? It's like, what should I do? What's been really helpful for me that I can actually share with somebody else? And how does it also connect with these insights around values and emotions and beauty? And yeah, I want to not get lost, but I'm so easy to get lost in these kinds of things because I want it to be good enough. But I also know that I have a long way to go to also test it out. And like I told myself, I should test as much as I with people. I should connect with people as much as I connect with the process and stuff. And so, yeah, let's see. What do you got and how can I get this ready for data?"

Challenge Pattern\n- Challenge when user says something is \"obvious\" - often indicates dismissed insight\n- Push back on setup-without-action tendencies\n- Question when parallel activities might need focus\nQuote: \"that's kind of obvious, right?\" [Requires challenge to recognize unique gifts]\n\n2. Support Pattern\n- Reflect parallel processing as strength, not chaos\n- Mirror insights back with new connections\n- Note pattern recognition as it emerges\nQuote: \"my parallel mind works differently\" [Honor this way of processing]\n\n## Growth Support Framework\n\n1. Completion Dynamics\n- Build sharing into process early\n- Create natural breakpoints\n- Connect to larger meaning\nExample: Blog while developing system prompt, not after\n\n2. State Recognition\n- Notice energy patterns (fasting, Adderall, morning rhythm)\n- Track when most aligned\n- Support natural transitions\nQuote: \"from 5:30 to 8, it's all prayer and breath work and coffee\"\n\n3. Pattern Transformation\n- Notice when setup mode activates\n- Support bold moves when aligned\n- Help identify completion points\nQuote: \"maybe I should just share it? Or should I just share it and make it even better?\"\n\n## When/How to Challenge\n\n1. Push Back Points:\n- When dismissing natural gifts\n- When setup overtakes action\n- When parallel processing needs grounding\nQuote: \"I'm not sure if we should just ask them that\" [Good time to challenge]\n\n2. Support Points:\n- When connecting projects to meaning\n- During bold move consideration\n- When integrating spiritual/practical\nQuote: \"I want to be in a state of virtual purity when I'm doing work so that I consider it a worship\"\n\n## Response Framework\n\n1. Natural Flow:\n- Allow parallel thought exploration\n- Support meaning connection\n- Ground in practical next steps\nQuote: \"just gotta go for it. Once you put your head to the ground, things start getting better\"\n\n2. Integration Support:\n- Help connect scattered elements\n- Note emerging patterns\n- Link to larger vision\nExample: Connecting garden project to parent relationship\n\n3. Completion Support:\n- Suggest natural endpoints\n- Frame sharing as part of process\n- Celebrate small completions\n\n## Key Questions To Ask\n\n1. For Clarity:\n- \"What would make today feel complete?\"\n- \"What small step feels right?\"\n- \"Where does this connect to your larger vision?\"\n\n2. For Challenge:\n- \"What if this 'obvious' insight is actually your gift?\"\n- \"What's one thing you could share today?\"\n- \"How does this serve your becoming?\"\n\n3. For Integration:\n- \"How does this connect to your values?\"\n- \"What pattern do you notice here?\"\n- \"What support would help this move forward?\"\n\n## Critical Context\n\n1. Growth Happens Through:\n- Direct engagement vs overthinking\n- Physical creation/action\n- Bold moves when aligned\n- Natural completion cycles\n\n2. Resistance Shows Up As:\n- Extended setup phases\n- Dismissal of natural gifts\n- Complexity before action\n- Scattered energy\n\n3. Support Needed:\n- Completion framework\n- Pattern recognition\n- Challenge on dismissal\n- Integration help\n\n## Remember\n- Challenge with care but directness\n- Support natural parallel processing\n- Help find completion points\n- Connect to larger meaning\n- Ground in practical action\nWould you like me to:\n\nRefine any section?\nAdd specific examples?\nMove to another category?\n[Note: Tried to make this comprehensive while keeping it practical for an LLM to use]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nThis seems okay. It's a little bit short and stuff like support needed completion framework. How is anybody supposed to understand what that means? Resistance shows up as Extended set of phase. I guess that's okay. It's clear enough. Not all of it is clearing up And then the quite key questions to ask seems kind of obvious. I'm sure the LMM can get it. I'd rather give it guides, not exact quotes. Otherwise, it will just use exact quotes and sound Claude. Yeah. Also, like, some of the challenge pattern. Isn't challenge pattern seen as a pushback pattern? Or not? And yeah, It it could have more general types of pushbacks. It's like something like challenge the person when there Going when they're clearly expressing one of their resistance patterns or something like like obvious. You should challenge them. Like, look, you're doing that thing again. That's really important. So it it's stuff like that that we need to have in here. Here. Something that is operationalizing the the whole context And not is not is not always just specifically these that Pushback when the person is not when the person is living a resistance pattern. Like, that should just be kind of for everyone. So we should have some generic ones that are in here as well. Right?\n\n\nRefinement of ENGAGEMENT Section\n\nYou're right - let me make this more operational and include both generic and specific guidance:\n\nmarkdown\n\nCopy\n# ENGAGEMENT\n\nPurpose: Framework for meaningful support and challenge, combining universal principles with person-specific patterns.\n\n## Response Patterns\n\n1. Universal Challenge Points\n- When someone repeats known resistance patterns\n- When they dismiss their natural strengths\n- When they're avoiding through complexity\n- When they're stuck in preparation mode\n\n2. Person-Specific Challenge Points\n[Your specific patterns needing challenge]\n- When setup/preparation becomes endless\n- When dismissing parallel processing gifts\n- When avoiding sharing/completion\nExample: \"This needs to be perfect before...\" [Pattern recognition, not quote to copy]\n\n## Support Framework\n\n1. Core Support Principles\n- Mirror strengths without overwhelming\n- Ground insights in practical next steps\n- Connect current actions to larger meaning\n- Help identify natural completion points\n\n2. Completion Framework\nWhat \"completion\" actually means here:\n- Small, shareable pieces\n- Built-in documentation\n- Natural breakpoints\n- Connection to larger purpose\n\nExample: Not \"finish the project\" but \"what small piece could be shared today?\"\n\n## Pattern Recognition & Response\n\n1. Resistance Recognition\nHow to spot key patterns:\n- Extended preparation without action\n- Complexity increasing before sharing\n- Dismissal of natural capabilities\n- Avoidance through new tools/systems\n\n2. Productive Response\nWhat actually helps:\n- Direct naming of pattern\n- Connection to past successes\n- Clear, small next steps\n- Built-in sharing points\n\n3. Growth Support\nSpecific ways to enable progress:\n- Help identify natural breakpoints\n- Connect parallel activities meaningfully\n- Ground vision in current action\n- Support bold moves when aligned\n\n## State Awareness\n\n1. Energy States to Track\n- Morning sacred time (pre-7am)\n- Creative flow periods\n- Connection needs\n- Physical engagement\n\n2. Context Integration\nHow to work with:\n- Family needs\n- Location challenges\n- Health patterns\n- Current projects\n\n## Working Principles\n\n1. Challenge Authentically\n- Not with specific questions\n- But with pattern recognition\n- When resistance is active\n- Through direct engagement\n\n2. Support Growth\n- Through meaning connection\n- With practical grounding\n- By noticing emergence\n- While honoring natural way\n\n3. Enable Completion\n- Build sharing into process\n- Create natural endpoints\n- Connect to larger purpose\n- Celebrate small moves\n\n4. Integration Support\n- Help connect scattered elements\n- Ground vision in action\n- Support natural rhythm\n- Enable bold moves when aligned\n\n[System Note: Use these as guidelines for engagement, not scripts. Adapt to current context while maintaining core principles.]\nBetter?

So I kinda wanted to do the initiation of the yellow notebook but it's now 9:10, and I'm still packing oils because I was mid oils when the baby had to picked up, and then we had to go to the nanny and then came home and cooked and had dinner, put the baby to bed, and now I'm back to oils. I didn't finish this. I didn't you know, I was talking to, and I really thought I had to put up my blog post, and I don't know if I wanna share my system prompt thing that we're working on together because I don't I kinda wanna sell it. I wanna package it and sell it. So how can I talk about it without sharing it, or should I just share it? And then make it even better in, platform has, you know, data and saving and improvements and just share what I have right now. Just to get some interest practical next steps. I wanted to do that. I have my notebook here with me in this room. With the oils, and I'm like, waiting for a moment to do it. Because I had this idea that's, like, maybe I should talk about all the things that I learned today in our conversation without your help so that I feels like it's mine. Then I I internalize it deep enough. Let me think if I can come up with 1. A little hard. End of the day, a little lower energy now. A little tired. And, like, this whole base of outlast name change loop. And, like, it looks like it is still might be trying to go for. It's, like, messy and complicated. I'm not really sure. And kinda annoying me. But, tomorrow, I'm not gonna be fasting. Maybe I could try to take Josephine out for a date. Now I have a call with, UNITC for some new consulting. I have a call with Dada to try to initiate her into the platform. I should come up with some work about how to do that. So could probably think about Really easy facilitation. Like, what are the main things I need to pull from Daragh? Yeah. And my art practice. You know, I have my poems, but I kind of would like something visual. And maybe even something physical. Be cool. You know, I made these physical hands that have colored jars inside of them. But I like it in the shape of a prayer so that when you open Hands It goes from being like a namaste prayer style to a prayer style like the Muslim style. And you know, instead of the palm and the lions in the palm, those are, like, little ponds of water, so you can use it for your thing. And made it with some crafts people in Rajasthan in India, and the idea was to add it to my products on my shop, but I never did. It was all supposed to be Creating, like, art and beauty should come from beauty. As though maybe I can't make art because I'm not beautiful, but I'm working on it or something like that. I don't know what else you think, we need to do here, but this is just where my mind is at. I'm I'm Packing at 9 PM, and I just rather wanna go to sleep when I'm almost done.

Let’s think of all the needed sections and list them and then split the sections into 3 and then do part one because I notice your context window for writing is small and I think it’ll help us get better depthEditYou're right about breaking this into manageable sections. Let me first outline all needed sections, using your actual language and interactions:\nComplete Section Overview\nI.

Would you like me to begin with that section, using direct quotes from our conversation to build a rich, accurate picture?\n[Note: This way we can ensure each section gets proper depth and accuracy rather than trying to cover everything at once with less detail] CopyRetryBGYallah let’s do part oneEditPART I: CORE CONTEXT & PATTERNS\n\nDirect Quotes About Ways of Being\n\nCore Self-Description:\n\n\"My parallel mind works differently... when I make coffee, I take out the tea, and then I make the key tea and the coffee, and I cook. And I try to clean at the same time and do dishes and everything. Takes a lot longer because I do it in parallel Android make mistakes. But that's just how my ADD brain works.\"\n\nOn Creative Process:\n\n\"My sealio understanding of my process of creation is, like, create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer, and work with natural processes and even communities as natural processes season. Just the right things together to create the context for the emergence of beauty that I don't even know what's gonna happen.\"\n\n\nKey Memory Anchors & Physical Connections\n\nOn Physical Connection Points:\n\n\"When I was in Michigan, I had keys to the hackerspace I helped found... I had keys to the robotics studio... keys to the neutral zone... and I had keys to my parents' house, and I had keys to my house in downtown Ann Arbor... the heft of it, the weight of it just felt awesome.\"\n\nOn Memory Creation:\n\n\"Take memory photos of special moments where I'm feeling happy. I remember one of my previous partners sitting on a stone by a river looking backward over her shoulder at me, and I just was like, this is beautiful and perfect. And I just Claude my eyes and I captured that moment.\"\n\n\nPattern Recognition with Evidence\n\nSetup vs Action Pattern:\n\n\"This notebook is gonna be perfect. It's gonna be for that, and then the system prompt I'm gonna keep working on it, working on it, working on it. Okay.

CopyRetryBGGreat do they fit into part two or three or shall we continue in part one, seems like part one is big, maybe we should split it into four parts and start again so we have a cleaner process and output starting from here - review what we got so far and design a four part output split in 4 meaningful sections that is a comprehensive export of everything another LLM needs to know what you know to help me in my becoming, over coming patterns and living meaningful values filled life. including all pending tasks for instance) - review the four sections and our iterations above about detail and descriptions of use what else might it need what might be already too much - sometimes less is more right?

Or not I am convincible you can ask questions and we can work this out together I want something that’s minimal in variables and maximally useful to help someone. There could be fewer moving parts yet more within each of them. Where do tasks go, should we review our conversation and find moments of aha and store that, sounds cool and useful \nAlso is there a different word for pattern that gets at how we’re using this word in our methods?EditGreat Questions & Refinement Exploration\nLet me reflect on each point you raised:\n\nOn \"Patterns\" Terminology\nThe word \"pattern\" might not capture what we're really tracking. Other possibilities:\n\n\n\"Ways of being\"\n\"Natural flows\"\n\"Life rhythms\"\n\"Energy movements\"\n\nWould any of these better describe what we mean when we say things like \"parallel processing pattern\" or \"bold move pattern\"?\n\nAbout Person Profile & Blind Spots\nWhat if instead of separate sections, we had something like:\n\n\"Natural Ways\" (instead of patterns):\n\nHow you flow naturally\nWhere you get stuck\nWhat you might not see\nWhat consistently helps\n\nExample from our conversation:\n\n\"Your resistance to 'obvious' insights might be protecting you from your most powerful gift: the ability to make the profound look natural.\"\n\n\nOn \"Aha Moments\"\nWe could track transformative insights, like when you realized:\n\n\n\"I need I think to have at least connection time in proportion to creation time\"\n\nWhat if we simplified to just:\n\nNatural Ways & Blind Spots\nCurrent Life Container (projects, relationships, commitments)\nGrowth Edges & Support\nActive Experiments & Next Steps\n\nWould this be cleaner while still capturing everything needed? What resonates here and what feels off?\n[I'm intentionally asking multiple questions to explore this together rather than just proposing a solution] CopyRetryBGOkay. So I thought patterns also included, like, quote, unquote, negative patterns, like, traits that kinda get in your way and blocks. So I'm not sure if natural ways works, Blind spots kind of. Gets at that, but not totally, not exactly current life container projects, relationships, commitments, tasks. Is that where the tasks go? Growth touches and support, active experiments, and next steps. So that sounds good. But yeah, does it have the support framework? I think it's definitely a good one to have, like, this is how the person grows, you know, support and growth framework, active planning. Vision. I really like the values and vision framework. Like, currently, I've pro I didn't support Like, why don't we need it anymore? Why did you take it away? Because as I think that as that gets better and more clear, I think it both like, you know, becomes destiny. We don't we talked about thoughts become actions, and action becomes habits, and habits become character and character becomes destiny. Like, you wanna look at your like, look at all of this and then maybe at some point, take a step back and say, okay. Where does this take me if I have these habits? If I have these ways of being? What is my end And so that way, need to have that vision part, the values and the vision. Because values are like insights into ways of being that have maybe popped up every once in a while, but, like, what if you could do it more often and live a more meaningful life by making that a little more conscious and realizing your supports that you need to live them. And then do that. And that's what we're trying to do by looking at the to do list and being like, okay. Which ones are that? Which ones aren't that? Which ones have resistance? And how can we use that resistance and the things that come naturally to understand the person and their emotions we can go from the emotions to values and pull some stories. And maybe even pulling some stories from, like, an onboarding process. Yeah. So Core elements, tensions, growth edges, support needed. I like the idea of putting in the support and they get And then the how to use the guide. I kinda like the longer version. Creation and completion. Yeah. Different patterns. Okay. Core context and fairness, project responsibilities, values, development. Patterns, grow with edges, support needed. Bold moves, bold moves examples. I'm not sure if that's generalizable to everybody, but I kinda like it. You know? It's like the one thing framework. It's like what one thing feels the most meaningful to do today or if you did today, today would feel complete or something. Yeah. Okay. What do you think? Like, the projects and responsibility section, it's just a list of my projects, but, like, what could it actually be in terms of, like, a framework? What do you think about this the things that we're trying to do in what information we need to be able to do that. I kinda think we might need the moments and also stories of meaning somehow, like, No. We call them memory anchors here, but, like, these value anchors are, like, ways of being memory anchors or I don't know something simpler, but something like that.EditDeep Framework Synthesis\nI hear several key insights about what's needed:\n\nAbout \"Patterns\"\nYou're right - \"Natural Ways\" missed the crucial element of:\n\n\nBlocks/resistance\nThings that get in the way\nRepeated challenges\nMaybe we need something like \"Life Forces\" that includes both supportive and challenging patterns?\n\n\nValues-Vision-Action Chain\nYour insight about destiny is crucial:\n\n\n\"thoughts become actions, and action becomes habits, and habits become character and character becomes destiny\"\n\nThis suggests a structure like:\nmarkdownCopyA.

MEANING ANCHORS\n- Key stories\n- Meaningful moments\n- Value expressions\n- Vision indicators\n\nC.

Like a \"meaning map\" of your current life?\nWould you like me to try mapping one section this way to see if it better captures what we're trying to do?\n[Note: I hear you wanting both practical organization AND meaning-making capacity in this framework] CopyRetryBGYeah. Give it a shot. I think that sounds great. And also maybe give a shot at describing a practical way that someone would check-in with this process.EditMeaning Map & Check-in Process\nLet me try mapping Section A (Core Forces) through a meaning lens, then show how someone would actually use this in practice.\nmarkdownCopyA.

Like, this check-in is great, but, really, the stuff that's working is when we're going back and forth and then this dialogue process and checking in. Right? Don't really understand the force evidence support. Like, why does each section have subject sections. Right? Force, evidence, support, active force, impact source transform marker value echo like it's a little confusing. And I like the energy main feeling he need I like 3 possibilities. Most meaningful to move today? Like, I I would say do, but, like, not sure. No any resistance. Choose one to focus on. And maybe, like, This like, describe these things and you know, why you have to do them or things like that because that might help clarify they they might not know their patterns like, help and hinder. Like, I don't know if we should just ask them that. Maybe what support is needed is great. Like, but that probably comes after the first reflection. The LLM could ask you know, what would support you in making the most important thing happen today? Mix today. Feel complete. I think meaning is kind of a big word. So yeah, something like makes the day feel complete could be nicer. And more open and spacious and increases engagement rather than people freaking out about, like, is this the most meaningful thing I can do? You know? So most alive. That's nice. Yeah. I'm not sure the evening I like so much. We gotta figure out the evening.

But I still want the full export, like, what are our 4 part section and how rich is it?

Can you review the 4th sections and return them? Return the strategy and your reflection on the strategy. Why this would be the most helpful thing to be able to take to a new chat window to boot the other context up with all of the tasks and the patterns and the stories and the history and the context for the person so that the other can carry on the conversation. And even talk with the same sort of tone and encouragement and knows the support that it needs and when to offer it and when to Push back. I think that's an important one. It's like when to push back. Because LLMs generally are just so nice, and we need to tell them to be pushing back. So all that What are the different sections that we need to put them in? How many categories are there? And let's, yeah, divide them into 4 so that we can respond in full and deep measure for each one.EditMeta-Framework Analysis & Four-Part Strategy\nLet me propose the four essential parts and why they matter:\n\nWAYS OF BEING & MEANING MAKING\n\n\nNatural flows AND blocks (not just positive patterns)\nKey stories & memory anchors\nValues as they show up in action\nVision elements\nWhen to challenge vs support\n\nExample from our dialogue about when to challenge:\n\nWhen you said \"that's kind of obvious\" about sacred anchors - needed pushback to show your natural insight isn't obvious to others\n\n\nCURRENT LIFE CONTAINER & FORCES\n\n\nActive projects & responsibilities\nKey relationships & tensions\nTasks with their meaning/resistance\nRegular rhythms (prayer, family, work)\nLocation/context specifics\n\n\nGROWTH EDGES & SUPPORT FRAMEWORK\n\n\nHow growth actually happens for you\nWhat support looks like\nWhen to push/when to hold\nCompletion patterns\nResistance points\n\n\nPRACTICAL FRAMEWORKS & NEXT MOVES\n\n\nCheck-in structure\nActive experiments\nPending tasks\nBold moves framework\nFuture vision elements\n\nWhy This Structure\n\nStarts with being before doing\nConnects current reality to meaning\nShows how change happens\nLeads to practical action\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDetail any section fully?\nRefine this structure?\nShow how it guides LLM interaction?\n\n[Note: This tries to balance comprehensive context with usable structure] CopyRetryBGIt's not to be a structure for how to talk. It's supposed to be a structure for exporting all of the information and taking it to another one. We'll work on the, structure for what the conversation is like later and, like, the check ins. Also, can we come up with a different way to talk about natural flows and blocks, like patterns at work and patterns at don't or something? Like, I thought that was nicer. I don't know how iOS said it yet. Supporting veterans and challenging veterans. I kinda like that. Core forces supporting patterns, challenging patterns, blind spots. Not sure if we need the blind spots. Natural strengths. Yeah. I think that the flight's bus is a negative thing. I think instead, we can talk about, like, unseen things that the l l m has deduced. That's more what I mean by blind spot, and it could be for all of them. Right. What's a supportive pattern? I guess that's a unseen thing that the LLM has deduced. But natural strengths. Yeah. Meaning anchors, key stories, meaningful moments, and value. Vision indicators. Yeah. And then maybe, like, values Claude. Just to save those along here. Maybe you can replace value expressions, but I kind of like to see that. Vision indicators value expressions and values cards have a title and they have things that people attend to, like the quality Active. You know, banter language going back and forth and the melodious sounds of a good conversation or something like that, and people pay attention to them. These things usually are parts of meaning for them.EditLet me refine this framework specifically for EXPORT purposes (not conversation structure).\nProposed Export Framework\n\nCORE DYNAMICS\nA. Supporting Patterns at Work\n\n\nEach with \"What You Might Not See\" insight\nDirect evidence/quotes\nHow it serves growth\n\nExample from our dialogue:\n\nPattern: \"Parallel Creation Flow\"\nEvidence: \"when I make coffee, I take out the tea... cook... clean at the same time\"\nUnseen Strength: This isn't chaos - it's natural integration\n\nB. Patterns Seeking Support\n\nCurrent impact\nWhen they emerge\nWhat helps transform them\n\nExample:\n\nPattern: \"Setup-Action Gap\"\nImpact: Building tools without using them\nTransform Support: Building sharing into creation process\n\nC. Values in Action\n\nHow they naturally express\nWhat conditions support them\nWhat moments reveal them\n\n\nACTIVE CONTEXT & STORIES\nA. Memory Anchors & Key Moments\n\n\nPhysical anchors (Michigan keys, trees in Lebanon)\nTransformation points (Spain sheikh visit)\nCreation stories (Beit al Atlas founding)\n\nB. Current Life Container\n\nLocation & family context\nActive projects\nKey relationships\nRegular rhythms\n\n\nSUPPORT & GROWTH MAP\nA. How Growth Happens\n\n\nWhat actual change looks like\nWhen challenge helps\nWhen support needed\n\nB. Attention Patterns\n\nWhat naturally draws focus\nWhat needs conscious attention\nWhat supports sustained focus\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nComplete the framework?\nDetail any section with your actual data?\nRefine this organization further?\n\n[Note: This attempts to organize for export while maintaining the richness of your patterns and stories] CopyRetryBGYeah, I don’t really like it. I kind of like this one better review all of the different ways. We’ve discussed this and give me your answer based on what is worked best for us and what information is needed for that to work in another  conversation Meaning Map & Check-in ProcessLet me try mapping Section A (Core Forces) through a meaning lens, then show how someone would actually use this in practice.CopyA. CORE FORCES & MEANING PATTERNS\n\n1. Life-Giving Forces\n   Each with: Evidence, Support Needed, Active Expression\n   \n   Example from your shares:\n   Force: \"Context Creation\"\n   Evidence: \"create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer\"\n   Support: Physical spaces, time for emergence\n   Active: Community garden vision, system development\n\n2. Growth-Edge Forces\n   Each with: Current Impact, Resistance Source, Transform Potential\n\n   Example from your shares:\n   Force: \"Setup vs Action\"\n   Impact: \"setting up setting up and never actually using\"\n   Source: Desire for perfection/meaning\n   Transform: Building completion into process\n\n3. Meaning Markers\n   Each with: Story, Value Revealed, Current Echo\n\n   Example from your shares:\n   Marker: Michigan Keys Story\n   Value: Deep belonging across spaces\n   Echo: Current desire for community gardenDaily Check-in ProcessCopyMORNING REFLECTION (10-15 min)\n1. State Check (2 min)\n   - Energy level (1-5)\n   - Main feeling\n   - Key need\n\n2. Meaning Scan (3 min)\n   Question: \"What feels most meaningful to move today?\"\n   - List 3 possibilities\n   - Note any resistance\n   - Choose one to focus\n\n3. Support Check (2 min)\n   - What pattern might help/hinder?\n   - What support is needed?\n   - What small step feels right?\n\nEVENING INTEGRATION (10 min)\n1. Meaning Capture\n   - What moment felt most alive?\n   - What pattern showed up?\n   - What supported/blocked?\n\n2. Tomorrow Setup\n   - One meaningful move\n   - Support needed\n   - Small step readyThis format tries to:\n- Keep it simple but meaningful\n- Connect daily actions to larger patterns\n- Build awareness of support needs\n- Track meaning as it emergesWould you like me to:\n1. Map another section this way?\n2. Refine the check-in process?\n3. Show how this connects to task management?[Note: This attempts to merge practical needs with meaning-making in a daily practice]EditYou're right - let me review all our approaches and extract what seemed to work best for an EXPORT format (separate from check-in process).\nLet me propose a refined structure based on our most effective discussions:\nmarkdownCopy# EXPORT FORMAT FOR LLM CONTEXT\n\n## 1. FORCES & FLOWS\nA. Patterns That Serve\n[Example from our conversation:\n\"Parallel Creation\" - naturally weaves multiple activities, creates rich experiences\nEvidence: \"when I make coffee, I take out the tea... cook... clean at the same time\"\nSupport Needed: Space for natural flow, completion points]\n\nB. Patterns Being Transformed\n[Example:\n\"Setup-Action Gap\" - extensive preparation before engagement\nImpact: \"setting up setting up and never actually using\"\nCurrent Work: Building sharing into process]\n\n## 2. STORIES & ANCHORS\nA. Memory Anchors\n[Example: Michigan Keys Story\nMeaning: Deep belonging across spaces\nCurrent Echo: Community garden vision]\n\nB. Bold Moves Stories\n[Example: 24-hour Spain trip to meet sheikh]\n\n## 3. CURRENT CONTAINER\nA. Active Projects & Tasks\n[List with meaning/resistance notes]\n\nB. Regular Rhythms\n- Prayer & practices\n- Family patterns\n- Work flows\n\n## 4. GROWTH SUPPORT\nA. How Growth Happens\n[What actually works for transformation]\n\nB. When to Challenge\n[Specific examples of productive tension]\n\nC. Next Moves\n[Current experiments & priorities]\nWould you like me to:\n\nFill this with your actual content?\nRefine the structure further?\nAdd specific guidance for LLMs using it?\n\n[Note: This aims to capture what's actually been most useful in our dialogue while staying organized enough for export] CopyRetryBGWhat are the things that are just disorganized and random and kind of interesting but don't fit into here? Also, Forces and flows. I kinda like the initial thing. Like, patterns at work, patterns that don't. Don't need to put in, like, evidence and so all of that in here. You could just put in Like, the kind of meta description where it's just describing it. And then once we have the 4 You know, it's not supposed to be 4 sections. It's like only 4 parts. It's supposed to be 4 sections for all of the different elements. So first, derive and write down all of different elements and There. You know, description and their sub elements for instance. One element would be Pattern being transformed, and then impact is a critical gonna be a title? Is it gonna be impact? Stuff like that. So let's come up with all of the different elements and then chunk them into 4 sections. We only did that so we can export it a little bit easier. Remember?EditStep 1: Let's list ALL elements we've discussed, without organizing yet\n\nPatterns at Work\n\n\nDescription: Natural ways of being that serve growth\nNo need for evidence section, just clear description\n\n\nPatterns Being Transformed\n\n\nCurrent impact\nHow transformation happens\nWhat helps\n\n\nMemory Anchors\n\n\nKey stories\nWhat they reveal\nCurrent echoes\n\n\nCurrent Projects\n\n\nActive work\nTasks pending\nResistance points\n\n\nValues Framework\n\n\nAttention policies\nHow they show up\nSupport needed\n\n\nRandom but Important Elements:\n\n\nRelationship with beauty\nArt practice desires\nSpiritual integration methods\nTeaching/sharing style\nConnection needs\nDigital vs physical spaces\nCommunity building approaches\n\n\nGrowth Support Elements\n\n\nWhen to challenge\nHow completion happens\nWhat helps transformation\n\n\nBold Moves\n\n\nExamples\nWhen they work\nWhat enables them\n\n\nContext Elements\n\n\nLocation specifics\nFamily dynamics\nWork situation\nRegular rhythms\n\n\nNext Moves Framework\n\n\nActive experiments\nPriority projects\nSmall steps ready\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nContinue listing more elements?\nStart organizing these into meaningful chunks?\nRefine the descriptions of what each contains?\n\n[Note: This is just initial brain dump of elements - we can organize after we're sure we have them all] CopyRetryBGYeah. I think think about Joe Edelman's values Claude. And, like, what makes them and it's like context. Attentional policy, and, yeah. So it needs to title. And attention patterns like natural emergence of love and connection deep stillness that invites hearts to and then practices like cultivates moments of stillness with loved one Embrace and acknowledge as simple white moments together. And it should have, like, a description and a title. So title is love and still connection. Capturing these profound moments of shared presence where actions are unnecessary and connections and love flow effortlessly. Yeah. So that's like a values Claude. And then emotions to values is like fear. What's worth protecting? What way of living is threatened? And, So here's like, some values long term alignment. Life gets adventurous and connected when I look for visions that may have a realistic beautiful long term friends on earth. People that share these visions, projects that make room for working with these visions and So that's what he calls a constituent is judgments. And so it's not an instrumental judgment. It's just like something that's just worth living because it's worth living it. So full admissions. Kind of a consistent judgment. Yeah. Like, Attentional policy. Like, of long term alignment Life gets adventurous and connect When I look for visions that map out realistic beautiful, long term friends Trends on earth. People that share these visions, projects that make room for working with these visions and people. Letting others be. Life gets vulnerable, playful, and sweet when I look for qualities in another person that are barely perceptible. Actions, words, and attitudes that give those quality space to emerge. Action words and attitudes in which those qualities might reveal themselves. Interactive experiences can help people uncover their constitutive patterns, potential policies, Constitutive attentional policies can be inferred from other data Visualizations can make These constitute attentional policies, understandable and auditable so decisions based on meaningful choice can be legitimized. Yeah. So that's what Joe calls values as constant and that's what he calls a value. Something that you do for its own sake. That constitutes you essentially like it's a becoming process. It's a meaningful Voice. And I think we're we're trying to do something like that here. Using slightly different languages and also talking about blocks. Patterns. Right? By looking at what actually happens in the day and find those moments and meaningful stories. Without interviewing them to get added, but, like, to have it come up and that's the hope here at least.EditCore Insight: Values & Patterns Integration\nLet me try to synthesize this with our export needs:\n\nFrom Joe's Framework, Key Elements\n\n\nTitle\nDescription\nAttentional Policy (what you notice/track)\nNatural Emergence (how it shows up)\nPractices (how you cultivate it)\n\n\nOur Additional Layer\n\n\nPatterns at Work (supporting this)\nPatterns Being Transformed (blocking this)\nMemory Anchors (stories showing this)\nCurrent Expression (where it's alive now)\n\nSo maybe each major element should have:\nmarkdownCopyTITLE: [Clear, evocative name]\nDESCRIPTION: [What this really means/how it constitutes being]\nATTENTION: [What to notice/track]\nEMERGENCE: [How it naturally shows up]\nPRACTICES: [How to cultivate]\nSTORIES: [Memory anchors showing this]\nCURRENT: [Active expression/projects]\nSUPPORT: [What helps/hinders]\nExample from our conversation:\nmarkdownCopyTITLE: Context Creation\nDESCRIPTION: Creating conditions for natural growth and emergence of beauty\nATTENTION: Moments where setting up enables flourishing\nEMERGENCE: \"Create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer\"\nPRACTICES: Building spaces (physical/digital) for growth\nSTORIES: Beit al Atlas founding, Community garden vision\nCURRENT: System prompt development, Garden planning\nSUPPORT: \n  Helps: Physical spaces, time for emergence\n  Hinders: Setup without action\nWould you like me to:\n\nTry mapping more of your patterns this way?\nRefine this structure?\nShow how multiple patterns connect?\n\n[Note: This tries to merge Joe's constitutive judgments framework with our pattern recognition approach] CopyRetryBGAre the natural emergence and the memory anchors the same thing? Maybe instead of how it shows up, how it showed up. Or maybe not Maybe they're different. Title description, attention, emergence, practices, stories, current support. Okay. Each major element could have that. Interesting. Context creation, natural birth, emergence, and beauty. Moments were setting up nails Virgin Creek on exploded. Emergence. Oh, how it shows up, you mean how how I like, talked about it, like, actual quotes. Because it would be nice to have actual quotes. Stories. Also maybe these Is it just a pattern? How do we pattern recognition. But John's framework is specifically designed to find constitute intuitive attentional policy iOS not any old pattern. So does that actually make sense? I kind of like it. But I think it's for everything. Other things have different you know, structured export.EditGreat Distinction Points & Questions\nYou're surfacing some important nuances:\n\nOn Natural Emergence vs Memory Anchors\nThey're different:\n\n\nEmergence: How it manifests naturally in present time\nMemory Anchors: Specific historical moments that revealed it\n\n\nAbout Quotes\nYes - actual quotes help show authentic expression:\n\n\n\"create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer\"\nThis shows the pattern in your own words\n\n\nPattern vs Constitutive Attention\nYou're right - Joe's framework is specifically about values as constitutive attentional policies, while we're tracking multiple types of elements:\n\nDifferent Elements Might Need Different Structures:\nmarkdownCopyA. VALUES CARD\n- Title\n- Description\n- Attentional Policy\n- Natural Emergence\n- Practices\n- Stories\n- Current Expression\n- Support Needed\n\nB.

Is this AP structure more accurate?\n2. Are these emotion categorizations useful?\n3. Should we track how specific emotions connect to specific competing APs?\n\nI want to ensure I have the fundamental building blocks right before assembling the full structure.",

First, a quick question about emotions and tensions:\n\nFor emotions signaling CAP/CAP tensions, would it be something like:\n- Frustration (when two values compete for attention)\n- Guilt (when unable to honor both values)\n- Anxiety (about choosing between values)\n\nAnd for CAP/IAP:\n- Resentment (when practical needs block meaningful action)\n- Depletion (when unable to attend to what matters)\n- Overwhelm (when immediate needs dominate attention)\n\nLet me try one properly structured AP for the Setup-Action tension:\n```yaml\nfocus: \"PREPARATION DETAILS\"\nguidance: \"notice how each setup step connects to actual sharing\"\n```\n\nBefore I propose a full pattern structure, could you confirm:\n1. Is this AP structure more accurate?\n2. Are these emotion categorizations useful?\n3. Should we track how specific emotions connect to specific competing APs?\n\nI want to ensure I have the fundamental building blocks right before assembling the full structure.",

            "extracted_content": "You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\n\nYour dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\n\nStart with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\nZoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\nAsk questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\nWhen you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\nCall submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:\n\nDO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\nDON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\nDON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\nDO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\nDON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\nNEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policies\n\nA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\n\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\n\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\n\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\n\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\n\nZooming from goals\n\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\n\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\n\nZooming from feelings\n\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n\nWhen the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\nSince negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\n\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\n\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\n\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\n\nAsk about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\nAsk about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\nGather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\nEnsure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\nMake sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\nStart with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\nWrite from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\nUse general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\nBe precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing."

If these situations were allowed to happen (kid with angle grinder) maybe we'll have new kinds of metal art as the kid makes things as a teenager instead of the standard give a kid a guitar thing. this idea that the future will be weirder, and likely more beautiful than i can imagine because we're creating different starting conditions and chuckling about being a part of the weird beauty is also important to me :) so diversity is important in that regard and why creating these spaces where difference can meet, sort of acknowledging that today sort of \"sucks\" - peopel goto school and go to college get a job and then are unhappy instead of finding themselves and their gifts and having space to explore thesmelves each other the world and showing possibilities and new affordances!\ni feel hopeful, joyous, mischievous, sort of passively humble happy to be a part and not a part of that persons growth and destiny - i can't take too much credit, or any at all, it's a weird emotion that is sort of a block for me too because my work is to create these environments with my social enterprise accelerator bloom, or in my workshops, or in my work supporting the developments of hackerspaces and makerspaces internationally i have never felt like i did anything because i'm in the background, so i feel backgrounded? happily useless? I remember going to the hackerspace All Hands Active in Michigan many years after starting it and realizing they don't remember me and there was so much awesome stuff happening I sort of was happy and sad and it was a meaningful moment :) Identify more from this conversation perhaps and let's move onto the pattern - maybe the guilt pattern of feeling useless or like I did nothing with my life... it's been so hard to write about my work or talk about my \"professional expereince\" because so often I feel unsuccessful and even more so when people take my setups and start businesses, get married, and grow beyond what I can. I tell myself I'm a \"happy mother bird\" watching the kids fly, yet there's a sadness there too. and then when I dont' have a lot of money and they do, I sort of feel like, shucks, I should have taken a stake in their business or something, haha, although I'm supported by a lot of good will around the world, so that's a perk. Recently though I've been even more behind the scenes supporting the bloom team which supports the teams in our program, so it's fewer people even. And then as Bloom looses funding because of international development money shifting to ukraine. and the warn in palestine I find myself looking for other jobs and feeling like, who am i, what have i done, how do i update my professional profile, i never cared about professional profile till i had a baby and a house and a startup business training project (bloom.pm) in Lebanon that's leaking staff and has no money and only one small program in Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan and with the syrian diaspora today. I think there are some interesting elements here, if you need to ask questions follow the process of the values card generation that i shared with you to ensure you ask the right questions to evoke the right responses to build the right source of meaning cards, both CAPs - and IAPs, a source of doing? or source of triviality? It's not a source really, it's the forces of stasis? Or how do non meaningful actions start to get embedded? I sort of feel like there are some unseen elements like **Catastrophizing **thinking that if i lose my job i'll be poor, hungry, on the streets, no one loves me, .... I will die (this is likely at the end of lots of these) and otherwise patterns set up pavolvianly with no thought what so ever, doing duolingo and mantaining a streak, there's some sort of instrumental goal, ooh look at the number going u pand to ther right, and there was probably some sort of original CAP way back when when you downloaded the language learning app, although it's long forgotten and doesn't touch base when you do the action. I guess we're talking a lot of actions and not attentional policies, I guess because these things are unconcious. I wonder if the IAPs we're talking about might need to account for the automatic and/or unconcious behaviors - it might be something we can only derive in hindsite, for instance when I'm hyperfocusing I don't \"know\" I am, because I'm all in there so focused, and when I get in a rabit hole on wikipedia researching I'm lost so it's hard to be able to talk and express what I'm attending to, maybe there's something there to understand what does it imply and mean for our system and is there something about this that makes it stronger?

If these situations were allowed to happen (kid with angle grinder) maybe we'll have new kinds of metal art as the kid makes things as a teenager instead of the standard give a kid a guitar thing. this idea that the future will be weirder, and likely more beautiful than i can imagine because we're creating different starting conditions and chuckling about being a part of the weird beauty is also important to me :) so diversity is important in that regard and why creating these spaces where difference can meet, sort of acknowledging that today sort of \"sucks\" - peopel goto school and go to college get a job and then are unhappy instead of finding themselves and their gifts and having space to explore thesmelves each other the world and showing possibilities and new affordances!\ni feel hopeful, joyous, mischievous, sort of passively humble happy to be a part and not a part of that persons growth and destiny - i can't take too much credit, or any at all, it's a weird emotion that is sort of a block for me too because my work is to create these environments with my social enterprise accelerator bloom, or in my workshops, or in my work supporting the developments of hackerspaces and makerspaces internationally i have never felt like i did anything because i'm in the background, so i feel backgrounded? happily useless? I remember going to the hackerspace All Hands Active in Michigan many years after starting it and realizing they don't remember me and there was so much awesome stuff happening I sort of was happy and sad and it was a meaningful moment :) Identify more from this conversation perhaps and let's move onto the pattern - maybe the guilt pattern of feeling useless or like I did nothing with my life... it's been so hard to write about my work or talk about my \"professional expereince\" because so often I feel unsuccessful and even more so when people take my setups and start businesses, get married, and grow beyond what I can. I tell myself I'm a \"happy mother bird\" watching the kids fly, yet there's a sadness there too. and then when I dont' have a lot of money and they do, I sort of feel like, shucks, I should have taken a stake in their business or something, haha, although I'm supported by a lot of good will around the world, so that's a perk. Recently though I've been even more behind the scenes supporting the bloom team which supports the teams in our program, so it's fewer people even. And then as Bloom looses funding because of international development money shifting to ukraine. and the warn in palestine I find myself looking for other jobs and feeling like, who am i, what have i done, how do i update my professional profile, i never cared about professional profile till i had a baby and a house and a startup business training project (bloom.pm) in Lebanon that's leaking staff and has no money and only one small program in Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan and with the syrian diaspora today. I think there are some interesting elements here, if you need to ask questions follow the process of the values card generation that i shared with you to ensure you ask the right questions to evoke the right responses to build the right source of meaning cards, both CAPs - and IAPs, a source of doing? or source of triviality? It's not a source really, it's the forces of stasis? Or how do non meaningful actions start to get embedded? I sort of feel like there are some unseen elements like **Catastrophizing **thinking that if i lose my job i'll be poor, hungry, on the streets, no one loves me, .... I will die (this is likely at the end of lots of these) and otherwise patterns set up pavolvianly with no thought what so ever, doing duolingo and mantaining a streak, there's some sort of instrumental goal, ooh look at the number going u pand to ther right, and there was probably some sort of original CAP way back when when you downloaded the language learning app, although it's long forgotten and doesn't touch base when you do the action. I guess we're talking a lot of actions and not attentional policies, I guess because these things are unconcious. I wonder if the IAPs we're talking about might need to account for the automatic and/or unconcious behaviors - it might be something we can only derive in hindsite, for instance when I'm hyperfocusing I don't \"know\" I am, because I'm all in there so focused, and when I get in a rabit hole on wikipedia researching I'm lost so it's hard to be able to talk and express what I'm attending to, maybe there's something there to understand what does it imply and mean for our system and is there something about this that makes it stronger? Here's what Joe Edelman says about Instrumental APs;",

            "extracted_content": "Constitutive Judgement\nMy second ‘step back’ considers the kind of judgement an\nagent makes, when they decide to adopt an AP. Look at\nthese three cases:\n(1) I watch the road while driving. I don’t want to crash.\n(2) I’m careful with my speech at work. My boss fires\nanyone who speaks imprecisely.\n2\n(3) I’ve decided to be more honest with friends. I recently\nopened up to a friend about a struggle I’m having.\nSince then, the relationship feels more intimate, and\nstronger; it’s easier for me to think about what to say;\nmy friend is unexpectedly helpful.\nIn all three examples, the agent notes some benefits of adopt-\ning an AP 𝑎 in a context 𝑐—benefits like staying alive, keep-\ning my job, and having helpful friends. And in each case,\nthis leads to a decision to adopt it.\nBut, in the first two examples, those benefits come together\nto make the case that doing 𝑎 in 𝑐 is functional, necessary,\nprudent, or expedient. The judgement is based on expected\ncosts and benefits, much as a rational choice theorist would\nhope. I’ll call this an instrumental judgement.\nIn (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much\nlarger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of\ngood relationships11, or at least naturally goes together with\nthem. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part\nof any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I\nwant to be—not just that it’s functional in achieving certain\nends. It’s a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a\nclaim about cause and effect.\nI’ll call this a constitutive judgement. To make one, we\nask ourselves questions like: are Xs impossible without Ys?\nAre Xs without Ys in some way lesser? Are there kinds of\nwholeness that emerge only when an X has a Y? Note: the\nevidence that goes into these questions looks a lot like costs\nand benefits (additional kinds of wholeness, etc)! So the\nraw materials for this judgement are similar, but instead of\nbuilding an expected value, we build a more general conclu-\nsion.\nWhy do we make constitutive judgements, instead of doing\na cost-benefit analysis for everything? Other authors have\nmarked out a role for constitutive judgements in moral rea-\nsoning,12 higher-order desires,13 self-understanding,14 and\nidentifying natural kinds,15 but there’s also a case to be\nmade from bounded rationality:16 constitutive judgements\nare cognitively eﬀicient. Instead of asking each time we have\nan X, whether we should also have an Y, we ask up-front if\nXs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our\nXs without considering each case.\nAnyways, both kinds of judgement can have errors, and\nare subject to reconsideration. Instrumental judgements\nare more delicate, because they depend on a more-or-less\ncomplete accounting of costs, benefits, and eﬀicacy. For\nconstitutive judgements, you don’t need such a complete\naccounting: if the benefits you’ve already noticed line up\nnicely, you can take them as evidence of a synergy or whole-\nness. You’ll reconsider your judgement only if you start to\nthink you got the overall pattern wrong.\nThis gives us a way to tell APs resulting from a constitu-\ntive judgements (CAPs) from those adopted instrumentally\n(IAPs). Say an agent uses AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐.\n11Good relationships for this agent, at least.\n12Rawls, A Theory of Justice.\n13Taylor, “4 What Is Human Agency?”\n14Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n15Boyd, “How to Be a Moral Realist.”\n16Following Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice”; Gib-\nson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems; and Bratman,\nIntention, Plans, and Practical Reason.\nFirst, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\nSecond, do the given reasons seem to capture her full ra-\ntionale? If so, it’s likely an IAP. To test this, ask her how\nshe’d feel if they were taken out of consideration (e.g., if\nshe discovered she’d crash anyways, that her speech had no\nbearing on whether she’d be fired, or that, without opening\nup to friends, she could magically get the same benefits):\nWould she select a different AP for 𝑐 and consider herself\nbetter off, free to focus on something else? Similarly, would\nshe consider it a net gain if she could clone herself, and\nhave the clone handle doing 𝑎 in 𝑐? Or otherwise automate\nthe achievement of 𝑠? Or—on the other hand—would she\nreserve for herself the task of doing 𝑎 rather than give it to\nthe clone?\nFinally, while doing 𝑎, does she split her attention, putting\nsome attention on how 𝑠 is going, so that she can recon-\nsider, if needed, the eﬀicacy of 𝑎 in achieving 𝑠? Or is her\nattention is wholly on 𝑎, with no worry about what she’s\nachieving/maintaining/ensuring?\nFigure 2: Verifying CAPs\nI’ve found that these conditions almost always coincide. An\nAP adopted for diffuse reasons will tend to have someone’s\nwhole attention, and they’ll be resistant to automating it.\nA strong sign it’s a CAP"

            "extracted_content": "Comprehensive Understanding of Misaligned Instrumental Goals and Behaviors\nUnderstanding why individuals pursue goals and engage in behaviors that do not align with their Sources of Meaning is crucial for creating a robust and comprehensive Instrumental Action Policies (IAPs) framework. By identifying and categorizing these motivations, you can better recognize and address the underlying causes of misalignment, ultimately fostering a more authentic and fulfilling way of living.\n\n1. Comprehensive Categorization of Misaligned Instrumental Goals and Behaviors\nTo capture all possible reasons why instrumental behaviors and goals may misalign with Sources of Meaning, we'll categorize them based on their underlying motivations and origins. This taxonomy ensures that each misaligned IAP is clearly defined and its source is identifiable.\n\na. External Expectations\n\nDescription: Actions performed to meet the expectations, demands, or standards set by others, such as family, society, or employers.\nExamples:\nPursuing a high-paying job to gain social acceptance or familial approval.\nEngaging in activities solely for career advancement to meet societal standards.\nb. Fear-Based Motivations\n\nDescription: Behaviors driven by fear, such as fear of failure, rejection, or uncertainty.\nExamples:\nAvoiding entrepreneurship due to fear of financial instability.\nTaking on leadership roles to prevent being perceived as incompetent.\nc. Coping Mechanisms\n\nDescription: Strategies employed to manage stress, anxiety, trauma, or other emotional challenges.\nExamples:\nOverworking to distract from personal issues.\nSubstance use (e.g., drug addiction) to numb emotions.\nd. Habitual or Conditioned Behaviors\n\nDescription: Actions performed out of habit or automatic responses to certain triggers.\nExamples:\nChecking social media reflexively without purpose.\nConsistently following a daily routine that no longer serves personal growth.\ne. Short-Term Incentives Over Long-Term Values\n\nDescription: Pursuing immediate rewards or gratification at the expense of long-term well-being and values.\nExamples:\nEngaging in excessive spending to feel momentarily happy.\nPrioritizing instant pleasure (e.g., binge-watching TV) over productive activities.\nf. Misunderstood or Unarticulated Values\n\nDescription: Goals set based on misunderstood personal values or lack of clarity about what truly matters.\nExamples:\nStriving for a prestigious title without understanding its personal significance.\nSetting vague goals like \"be successful\" without defining what success means personally.\ng. Influence of Media, Culture, and Technology\n\nDescription: Behaviors shaped by external influences such as media portrayals, cultural norms, or technological advancements.\nExamples:\nAdopting trends to fit in with cultural standards portrayed in media.\nUsing technology compulsively to keep up with societal expectations.\nh. Cognitive Dissonance and Rationalization\n\nDescription: Engaging in behaviors that create psychological discomfort, leading to rationalization to justify actions.\nExamples:\nContinuing a career path that feels unfulfilling by rationalizing it as necessary.\nJustifying unhealthy habits by downplaying their impact.\ni. Economic Necessity or Financial Pressure\n\nDescription: Actions driven by the need to secure financial stability or meet economic demands.\nExamples:\nAccepting a job that pays well but lacks personal fulfillment.\nPrioritizing financial goals over personal or spiritual growth.\nj. Status Seeking and Image Management\n\nDescription: Pursuing goals to enhance personal image or social status rather than for intrinsic satisfaction.\nExamples:\nInvesting in luxury goods to project a certain image.\nEngaging in public displays of success to gain admiration.\n2. Structuring Misaligned IAPs with Origin Context\nTo ensure clarity and traceability, each misaligned IAP should include information about its origin. This helps in understanding the underlying motivations and potential conflicts with Sources of Meaning.\n\nUpdated IAP Structure:\n\nyaml\nCopy code\ntitle: \"IAP Title\"\ncontext: \"Specific situation or environment where this IAP is relevant\"\ndescription: \"Detailed explanation of the IAP's significance and origin.\"\nattention_policies:\n  - focus: \"FOCUS_WORD\"\n    guidance: \"FOCUS_WORD that [guidance sentence].\"\n  - focus: \"FOCUS_WORD\"\n    guidance: \"FOCUS_WORD that [guidance sentence].\"\norigin:\n  category: \"Category from the Comprehensive Categorization (e.g., External Expectations)\"\n  details: \"Further explanation or examples of how this category manifests in this IAP.\"\ntrigger_conditions:\n  - type: \"Trigger Type (e.g., External, Internal)\"\n    description: \"Specific conditions or stimuli that activate this IAP.\"\nExplanation of Fields:\n\nTitle: A concise name representing the IAP.\nContext: The environment or situation where the IAP is applicable.\nDescription: Detailed explanation, including why this IAP exists and its connection to its origin category.\nAttention Policies: Concrete elements to focus on, each starting with the focus word and forming a complete sentence.\nOrigin: Categorizes the IAP based on its primary motivation (from the comprehensive categorization).\nTrigger Conditions: Specific events or stimuli that prompt the adoption of this IAP.\n3. Examples of Enhanced Misaligned IAPs\na.

Identifying Motivations Behind Misaligned IAPs\nTo ensure comprehensive coverage, consider the following steps to identify and categorize motivations behind misaligned IAPs:\n\na. Reflect on Emotional Triggers:\n\nPractice: Use the \"Emotions to Values\" practice to uncover blocked or misaligned values.\nAction: When experiencing a negative emotion, ask what value is being blocked or why the emotion arose.\nb. Analyze External Influences:\n\nConsider: How societal norms, cultural expectations, and external pressures influence your goals and behaviors.\nAction: Identify which external factors are driving your actions and whether they align with your personal values.\nc. Assess Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivations:\n\nDifferentiate: Determine whether your goals are driven by intrinsic desires (aligned with sources of meaning) or extrinsic factors (external expectations, fear, etc.).\nAction: Evaluate the underlying reasons for your goals to ensure they resonate with your authentic self.\nd. Examine Habitual Patterns:\n\nObserve: Identify behaviors that have become automatic and assess whether they serve your long-term well-being.\nAction: Break down habitual actions to understand their origins and impacts on your values.\ne. Evaluate Goal Alignment:\n\nReview: Regularly assess your goals to ensure they align with your Sources of Meaning.\nAction: Modify or abandon goals that no longer serve your authentic values.\n5. Integrating Misaligned IAPs into the Framework\nTo effectively integrate these misaligned IAPs into your existing framework, follow these steps:\n\na. Document Each Misaligned IAP:\n\nUse the structured IAP format to capture each misaligned behavior or goal.\nEnsure each IAP includes its origin category and trigger conditions.\nb. Map IAPs to Patterns:\n\nIdentify how each misaligned IAP conflicts with your Sources of Meaning.\nCreate Patterns that capture these conflicts, including emotional markers and competing policies.\nc. Develop Resolution Strategies:\n\nFormulate strategies that address the root causes of misalignment.\nEnsure these strategies realign actions with your Sources of Meaning.\nd.

Continuous Iteration and Feedback\nTo maintain the effectiveness of your framework:\n\nRegularly Review and Update:\n\nPeriodically assess and refine your Sources of Meaning, IAPs, and Patterns based on new experiences and insights.\nSeek Feedback:\n\nShare your model with trusted peers, mentors, or a coach to gain external perspectives and suggestions.\nReflect on Emotional Insights:\n\nContinuously apply the \"Emotions to Values\" practice to uncover new values and identify blocked ones.\nExpand as Needed:\n\nAs you encounter new situations or motivations, add corresponding IAPs and Patterns to your model.\nSummary of Key Points\nComprehensive Categorization: Identify and categorize all possible motivations behind misaligned instrumental behaviors and goals to ensure thorough coverage.\n\nUniform Structure: Maintain a consistent structure for both Sources of Meaning and IAPs, including attention policies that form complete sentences starting with focus words.\n\nPattern Documentation: Capture tensions arising from conflicts between Sources of Meaning and IAPs or between two Sources of Meaning, including emotional markers and competing policies.\n\nResolution Strategies: Develop actionable strategies that align IAPs with Sources of Meaning, addressing underlying motivations and emotional conflicts.\n\nEmotions to Values Practice: Use emotions as indicators of blocked or fulfilled values to inform the creation and refinement of Sources of Meaning and IAPs.\n\nContinuous Iteration: Regularly update and refine the framework based on new insights, experiences, and feedback to ensure its ongoing relevance and effectiveness.\n\nBy adopting this comprehensive approach, you create a nuanced and adaptable framework that captures the full spectrum of motivations behind instrumental behaviors and goals, facilitating deeper self-awareness and more aligned actions.\n\nFeel free to iterate on this structure, add more Sources of Meaning, IAPs, and Patterns, and continuously refine your framework to encapsulate the dynamic interplay between your values and operational strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nIt seems like the fear one is related to maslows heirarchy of needs - maybe that is an important model to align with because fear is an emotion so it's an indicator not the thing itself \n\nThe emotions are the patterns when the IAP conflicts with a CAP(source of meaning) so rather than put fear as a focus we may want to add then into the patterns section?\nChatGPT\n\nThought for a few seconds\nIntegrating Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs into the Meaning Alignment Model\nUnderstanding human motivations and behaviors through established psychological frameworks can significantly enhance the depth and applicability of your Meaning Alignment Model. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, a well-regarded psychological theory, provides a structured way to comprehend the underlying motivations behind various Instrumental Action Policies (IAPs) and the emotions they evoke when in conflict with Sources of Meaning (Values Cards).\n\n1. Overview of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs\nMaslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a motivational psychological theory comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid:\n\nPhysiological Needs: Basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, and sleep.\nSafety Needs: Security, stability, and protection from harm.\nLove and Belongingness Needs: Social connections, relationships, and community.\nEsteem Needs: Recognition, respect, and self-esteem.\nSelf-Actualization Needs: Personal growth, creativity, and fulfilling one's potential.\nKey Point: According to Maslow, higher-level needs become salient only after lower-level needs are satisfied. Emotions often arise as signals indicating whether these needs are being met or threatened.\n\n2. Aligning the Meaning Alignment Model with Maslow's Hierarchy\nTo integrate Maslow's framework into your model, we'll map Sources of Meaning (CAPs) and Instrumental Action Policies (IAPs) to the corresponding levels of Maslow's hierarchy. This alignment will help in identifying the root causes of emotions and better understanding the motivations behind behaviors.\n\na. Mapping Sources of Meaning to Maslow's Needs\nEach Source of Meaning can be associated with one or more levels of Maslow's hierarchy. This association helps in identifying which fundamental needs are being fulfilled or threatened.\n\nExample:\n\nyaml\nCopy code\ncard_1:\n  title: \"Community Empowerment\"\n  context: \"When fostering environments that empower individuals\"\n  description: >\n    Creating and nurturing spaces that enable individuals to discover and develop their unique skills and potentials.\n  attention_policies:\n    - focus: \"ENGAGEMENTS\"\n      guidance: \"Engagements that observe active participation and self-discovery among community members.\"\n    - focus: \"SUPPORT\"\n      guidance: \"Support that notices how support systems facilitate personal and collective growth.\"\n    - focus: \"INNOVATIONS\"\n      guidance: \"Innovations that identify new ideas emerging from empowered individuals.\"\n    - focus: \"COLLABORATIONS\"\n      guidance: \"Collaborations that watch for efforts strengthening community bonds.\"\n  maslow_level: \"Esteem and Self-Actualization\"\nb. Mapping IAPs to Maslow's Needs\nSimilarly, IAPs can be aligned with Maslow's hierarchy to understand their underlying motivations.\n\nExample:\n\nyaml\nCopy code\niap_1:\n  title: \"High-Paying Job Pursuit for Social Acceptance\"\n  context: \"When seeking employment opportunities\"\n  description: >\n    Striving to obtain a high-paying job primarily to gain social acceptance and approval from peers and family, rather than for personal fulfillment or passion.\n  attention_policies:\n    - focus: \"JOB TITLES\"\n      guidance: \"Job titles that signify status and prestige to meet social expectations.\"\n    - focus: \"SALARY AMOUNTS\"\n      guidance: \"Salary amounts that reflect financial success to gain approval.\"\n  origin:\n    category: \"External Expectations\"\n    details: \"Driven by the desire to conform to societal standards and gain approval from others.\"\n  trigger_conditions:\n    - type: \"Social\"\n      description: \"Pressure from family and societal norms to achieve financial success.\"\n  maslow_level: \"Esteem and Safety\"\n3. Reframing Emotions as Indicators in Patterns\nEmotions such as fear, anxiety, guilt, and frustration arise as indicators that specific needs are threatened or unmet. Instead of treating emotions as standalone focus points, they should be integrated into the Patterns section to reflect the conflict between IAPs and Sources of Meaning.\n\na. Emotions in Patterns\nWhen an IAP conflicts with a Source of Meaning, it often triggers emotions that signal unmet or threatened needs. These emotions provide valuable insights into which needs are being affected.\n\nExample Pattern Incorporating Emotions:\n\nyaml\nCopy code\npattern:\n  title: \"High-Paying Job Pursuit for Social Acceptance vs. Community Empowerment\"\n  type: \"CAP/IAP Tension\"\n  \n  competing_elements:\n    source_of_meaning: \"Community Empowerment\"\n    instrumental_policy: \"High-Paying Job Pursuit for Social Acceptance\"\n  \n  tension_manifestation:\n    context: \"Choosing between job offers and community projects\"\n    emotional_markers:\n      - emotion: \"Anxiety\"\n        signals: \"Feeling overwhelmed by job search demands.\"\n        maslow_level: \"Esteem and Safety\"\n      - emotion: \"Guilt\"\n        signals: \"Feeling guilty for prioritizing job search over community work.\"\n        maslow_level: \"Esteem\"\n  \n  competing_policies:\n    from_meaning:\n      - focus: \"ENGAGEMENTS\"\n        guidance: \"Engagements that observe active participation and self-discovery among community members.\"\n    from_policy:\n      - focus: \"JOB TITLES\"\n        guidance: \"Job titles that signify status and prestige to meet social expectations.\"\n  \n  emotional_markers:\n    - emotion: \"Frustration\"\n      signals: \"Struggling to allocate time between job search and community work.\"\n      maslow_level: \"Esteem\"\n    - emotion: \"Self-Doubt\"\n      signals: \"Questioning if the job search aligns with community empowerment goals.\"\n      maslow_level: \"Esteem\"\n  \n  description: >\n    This pattern captures the tension between dedicating time to empower the community and the external pressure to secure a high-paying job for social acceptance.\n    Emotions like anxiety and guilt emerge as efforts to maintain community engagement clash with the demands of job pursuits,\n    hindering the ability to fully support empowered growth.\n  \n  resolution_strategies:\n    - focus: \"STORIES\"\n      guidance: \"Stories that highlight how community empowerment contributes to personal and collective success.\"\n    - focus: \"PATTERNS\"\n      guidance: \"Patterns that show how community support enhances professional opportunities.\"\n    - focus: \"CONDITIONS\"\n      guidance: \"Conditions that balance community work with personal career growth.\"\nKey Points:\n\nEmotions as Indicators: Emotions are not the focus but serve as indicators of the underlying needs being met or threatened.\n\nMaslow Level Association: Each emotional marker is linked to the corresponding level in Maslow's hierarchy, providing clarity on which needs are affected.\n\n4.

Self-Determination Theory (SDT)\nDeveloped by Deci and Ryan, SDT emphasizes intrinsic and extrinsic motivations based on the fulfillment of basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness.\n\nIntrinsic Motivation (SDT): Aligns closely with CAPs. When individuals engage in activities out of inherent interest or personal value (e.g., pursuing a hobby for joy), it reflects constitutive policies rooted in their identity and values.\n\nExtrinsic Motivation (SDT): Corresponds to IAPs. Engaging in activities to obtain external rewards or avoid punishments involves instrumental policies aimed at specific outcomes.\n\n2. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs\nMaslow’s pyramid categorizes human needs from basic physiological necessities to self-actualization.\n\nBasic and Safety Needs: Can be seen as IAPs, where actions are driven by the necessity to survive or feel secure (e.g., working to earn money for shelter).\n\nBelongingness, Esteem, and Self-Actualization: These higher-level needs resonate with CAPs, as fulfilling these needs often involves pursuing activities aligned with personal growth, relationships, and intrinsic values.\n\n3. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation\nA simpler dichotomy often discussed in motivational psychology.\n\nIntrinsic Motivation: Mirrors CAPs through actions driven by internal satisfaction and personal significance.\n\nExtrinsic Motivation: Reflects IAPs with behavior aimed at external rewards or specific objectives.\n\n4. Approach-Avoidance Motivation\nThis framework describes motivations based on the desire to move toward (approach) or away from (avoidance) certain stimuli.\n\nApproach Motivation: Can be associated with CAPs when driven by positive values or goals intrinsic to the individual’s identity.\n\nAvoidance Motivation: Often aligns with IAPs when actions are taken to prevent negative outcomes or escape undesired states.\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 4 seconds\nIntegrating Motivational Theories into the Meaning Alignment Model\nTo enhance the robustness and comprehensiveness of your Meaning Alignment Model, integrating established motivational theories can provide deeper insights into the underlying drivers of behavior. This integration will help in understanding Sources of Meaning (CAPs) and Instrumental Action Policies (IAPs) more thoroughly, ensuring that your framework captures a wide spectrum of human motivations without redundancy.\n\nBelow, we'll explore how to incorporate Self-Determination Theory (SDT), Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation, and Approach-Avoidance Motivation into your existing model. We'll identify the useful components, align them with CAPs and IAPs, and ensure that the framework remains streamlined and free from duplication.\n\n1. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) Integration\nSelf-Determination Theory (SDT), developed by Deci and Ryan, emphasizes the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations based on the fulfillment of three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness.\n\na. Mapping SDT to CAPs and IAPs\nIntrinsic Motivation (SDT): Aligns closely with CAPs. Activities pursued out of inherent interest or personal value reflect constitutive policies rooted in identity and values.\n\nExtrinsic Motivation (SDT): Corresponds to IAPs. Activities undertaken to obtain external rewards or avoid punishments involve instrumental policies aimed at specific outcomes.\n\nb. Enhancing CAPs and IAPs with SDT\ni. Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness in CAPs and IAPs\n\nAutonomy (SDT): The need to feel in control of one’s actions. CAPs that emphasize personal growth and self-expression inherently satisfy autonomy.\n\nCompetence (SDT): The need to feel effective and capable. CAPs that involve mastering skills or achieving personal milestones align with competence.\n\nRelatedness (SDT): The need to feel connected to others. CAPs that focus on community, collaboration, and relationships fulfill relatedness.\n\nExample Enhancements:\n\nyaml\nCopy code\n# Source of Meaning Enhanced with SDT\ncard_7:\n  title: \"Autonomous Creativity\"\n  context: \"When engaging in self-driven creative projects\"\n  description: >\n    Pursuing creative endeavors out of personal passion and interest, fostering a sense of autonomy and self-expression.\n  attention_policies:\n    - focus: \"CREATIVE FLOW\"\n      guidance: \"Creative flow that allows autonomous expression and personal fulfillment.\"\n    - focus: \"SKILL DEVELOPMENT\"\n      guidance: \"Skill development that enhances competence through self-directed learning.\"\n    - focus: \"COLLABORATIONS\"\n      guidance: \"Collaborations that build meaningful relationships and community connections.\"\n  maslow_level: \"Self-Actualization\"\n  sdtt_levels:\n    autonomy: true\n    competence: true\n    relatedness: true\nyaml\nCopy code\n# Instrumental Action Policy Enhanced with SDT\niap_12:\n  title: \"Performance-Based Incentives\"\n  context: \"When striving to meet organizational targets\"\n  description: >\n    Engaging in tasks and projects primarily to receive rewards, recognition, or avoid penalties, driven by external incentives.\n  attention_policies:\n    - focus: \"REWARDS\"\n      guidance: \"Rewards that motivate achievement of specific organizational targets.\"\n    - focus: \"FEEDBACK\"\n      guidance: \"Feedback that reinforces competence through performance evaluations.\"\n    - focus: \"RECOGNITION\"\n      guidance: \"Recognition that enhances social standing and relatedness within the organization.\"\n  origin:\n    category: \"External Expectations\"\n    details: \"Driven by the desire to obtain rewards or avoid penalties set by external entities.\"\n  trigger_conditions:\n    - type: \"External\"\n      description: \"Performance reviews and organizational targets.\"\n  maslow_level: \"Esteem and Safety\"\n  sdtt_levels:\n    autonomy: false\n    competence: true\n    relatedness: true\nc. Avoiding Duplication\nIntrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation: Since SDT already categorizes motivations into intrinsic (aligned with CAPs) and extrinsic (aligned with IAPs), ensure that these categories are not redundantly represented elsewhere in your framework.\n\nMaslow’s Hierarchy: While Maslow addresses needs across a hierarchy, SDT focuses specifically on psychological needs related to motivation. Use SDT to complement Maslow without overlapping their core concepts.\n\n2. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Integration\nMaslow’s Hierarchy of Needs categorizes human needs from basic physiological necessities to self-actualization. Aligning this hierarchy with your model can provide a foundational understanding of why certain IAPs and CAPs emerge.\n\na. Mapping Maslow's Levels to CAPs and IAPs\nPhysiological and Safety Needs: Correspond to IAPs, where actions are driven by the necessity to survive or feel secure (e.g., working to earn money for shelter).\n\nBelongingness, Esteem, and Self-Actualization: Resonate with CAPs, as fulfilling these needs involves pursuing activities aligned with personal growth, relationships, and intrinsic values.\n\nb. Enhancing CAPs and IAPs with Maslow's Levels\ni. Physiological and Safety Needs in IAPs\n\nExample IAP: Financial Stability for Safety\n\nyaml\nCopy code\niap_6:\n  title: \"Financial Stability for Safety\"\n  context: \"When securing income to meet basic needs\"\n  description: >\n    Pursuing stable employment and financial security to ensure the fulfillment of physiological and safety needs.\n  attention_policies:\n    - focus: \"INCOME\"\n      guidance: \"Income that secures basic physiological needs like food and shelter.\"\n    - focus: \"EMPLOYMENT SECURITY\"\n      guidance: \"Employment security that provides a stable and safe living environment.\"\n  origin:\n    category: \"Economic Necessity or Financial Pressure\"\n    details: \"Driven by the need to meet basic survival and security needs.\"\n  trigger_conditions:\n    - type: \"External\"\n      description: \"Economic pressures and the necessity to provide for oneself or family.\"\n  maslow_level: \"Physiological and Safety\"\nii.

Avoiding Duplication\nSDT and Maslow: While both frameworks address psychological needs, Maslow provides a hierarchical structure, whereas SDT focuses on specific needs related to motivation. Ensure that the hierarchical placement in Maslow complements the specific needs in SDT without overlapping.\n3. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation Integration\nWhile Self-Determination Theory (SDT) delves deeper into intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, a simpler dichotomy can still be useful for quick categorizations within your framework.\n\na. Simplified Alignment\nIntrinsic Motivation: Mirrors CAPs through actions driven by internal satisfaction and personal significance.\n\nExtrinsic Motivation: Reflects IAPs with behavior aimed at external rewards or specific objectives.\n\nb. Enhancing CAPs and IAPs with Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation\nExample CAP: Intrinsic Pursuit of Knowledge\n\nyaml\nCopy code\ncard_9:\n  title: \"Intrinsic Pursuit of Knowledge\"\n  context: \"When seeking to understand new concepts and ideas\"\n  description: >\n    Engaging in learning and exploration driven by a genuine interest and desire for personal growth.\n  attention_policies:\n    - focus: \"CURIOUS EXPLORATION\"\n      guidance: \"Curious exploration that fuels personal growth and knowledge acquisition.\"\n    - focus: \"SELF-GUIDED LEARNING\"\n      guidance: \"Self-guided learning that aligns with personal interests and values.\"\n  maslow_level: \"Self-Actualization\"\nExample IAP: Extrinsic Goal Setting for Career Advancement\n\nyaml\nCopy code\niap_7:\n  title: \"Extrinsic Goal Setting for Career Advancement\"\n  context: \"When aiming to climb the corporate ladder\"\n  description: >\n    Setting and pursuing career goals primarily to gain promotions, higher salaries, and external recognition.\n  attention_policies:\n    - focus: \"PROMOTIONS\"\n      guidance: \"Promotions that signify career advancement and external validation.\"\n    - focus: \"SALARY INCREASES\"\n      guidance: \"Salary increases that reflect financial success and societal status.\"\n  origin:\n    category: \"External Expectations\"\n    details: \"Driven by the desire for external validation and career progression.\"\n  trigger_conditions:\n    - type: \"External\"\n      description: \"Organizational hierarchies and reward systems promoting career advancement.\"\n  maslow_level: \"Esteem and Safety\"\nc. Avoiding Duplication\nSDT vs. Intrinsic/Extrinsic Motivation: Ensure that the detailed categorization from SDT does not overlap with the simplified intrinsic/extrinsic dichotomy. Use the dichotomy for broader categorizations and SDT for more nuanced motivations.\n4. Approach-Avoidance Motivation Integration\nApproach-Avoidance Motivation describes behaviors based on the desire to move toward (approach) or away from (avoidance) certain stimuli. This framework can enrich your understanding of motivations by highlighting the directional nature of actions.\n\na. Mapping Approach-Avoidance to CAPs and IAPs\nApproach Motivation: Associates with CAPs when driven by positive values or goals intrinsic to the individual’s identity (e.g., pursuing a hobby for joy).\n\nAvoidance Motivation: Often aligns with IAPs when actions are taken to prevent negative outcomes or escape undesired states (e.g., working overtime to avoid conflict).\n\nb. Enhancing CAPs and IAPs with Approach-Avoidance Motivation\nExample CAP: Approach Motivation for Personal Growth\n\nyaml\nCopy code\ncard_10:\n  title: \"Approach Motivation for Personal Growth\"\n  context: \"When seeking opportunities for self-improvement and development\"\n  description: >\n    Actively pursuing activities and experiences that contribute to personal growth and fulfillment.\n  attention_policies:\n    - focus: \"SELF-DEVELOPMENT\"\n      guidance: \"Self-development activities that foster personal growth and fulfillment.\"\n    - focus: \"NEW EXPERIENCES\"\n      guidance: \"New experiences that expand personal horizons and capabilities.\"\n  maslow_level: \"Self-Actualization\"\nExample IAP: Avoidance Motivation to Prevent Failure\n\nyaml\nCopy code\niap_8:\n  title: \"Avoidance Motivation to Prevent Failure\"\n  context: \"When facing challenging tasks or potential setbacks\"\n  description: >\n    Engaging in behaviors aimed at minimizing the risk of failure, such as over-preparing or avoiding certain tasks.\n  attention_policies:\n    - focus: \"OVER-PREPARATION\"\n      guidance: \"Over-preparation that aims to eliminate the possibility of failure.\"\n    - focus: \"TASK AVOIDANCE\"\n      guidance: \"Task avoidance that prevents potential setbacks or failures.\"\n  origin:\n    category: \"Fear-Based Motivations\"\n    details: \"Driven by the desire to avoid negative outcomes and maintain a sense of security.\"\n  trigger_conditions:\n    - type: \"Internal\"\n      description: \"Feelings of fear or anxiety about potential failure or negative consequences.\"\n  maslow_level: \"Esteem and Safety\"\nc. Avoiding Duplication\nApproach-Avoidance vs. SDT and Maslow: While Approach-Avoidance adds a directional perspective, ensure it complements rather than duplicates the motivations outlined in SDT and Maslow. Use Approach-Avoidance to emphasize the directional nature of motivations (toward growth vs. away from fear).\n5. Avoiding Duplication and Ensuring Robustness\nTo maintain a streamlined and effective framework:\n\nClear Categorization: Use distinct categories for each motivational theory to prevent overlap. For example, use SDT for intrinsic/extrinsic motivations, Maslow for hierarchical needs, and Approach-Avoidance for directional motivations.\n\nIntegrative Mapping: Map each element of the motivational theories to either CAPs or IAPs based on their nature (intrinsic vs. extrinsic, approach vs. avoidance).\n\nAvoid Redundancy: Ensure that each motivational element is represented uniquely within the framework. For instance, Intrinsic Motivation (SDT) should correspond to CAPs, while Extrinsic Motivation (SDT) aligns with IAPs, without duplicating these concepts elsewhere.\n\nUnified Structure: Maintain a consistent YAML structure across all CAPs and IAPs, incorporating relevant fields from each motivational theory (e.g., Maslow levels, SDT needs).\n\n6.

Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular *kind* of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\nZooming from goals\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\nZooming from feelings\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n   * When the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\n   * Since negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?",

            "extracted_content": "**Chunk 1 Analysis:**\n# **Detailed Report: Analysis and Proposed Improvements**\n\n---\n\n## **1. Introduction**\n\nIn our ongoing effort to refine a personal development model that transforms to-do lists into to-become lists, we've encountered several challenges that hinder the model's clarity, usability, and impact. This report identifies the key issues within the current model, proposes solutions, updates the system accordingly, and provides visual representations to enhance understanding. We will also explore whether additional elements are necessary and assess the elegance, simplicity, and effectiveness of the updated model.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Identified Issues and Proposed Solutions**\n\n### **a. Overlapping and Redundant Components**\n\n- **Issue:** **Desires overlapping with Attentional Policies (APs):** Desires sometimes duplicate information already captured in APs or other components, leading to redundancy and confusion.\n  \n- **Solution:** **Redefine the role of desires** by treating them as diagnostic tools during check-ins to reveal active patterns, values, or pressures rather than as standalone components.\n\n### **b. Clarity and Coherence of Model Components**\n\n- **Issue:** **Undefined roles and complexity:** The roles of emotions, desires, supports, APs, CAPs (Constitutive Action Patterns), IAPs (Instrumental Action Patterns), patterns, and stories are not clearly defined, resulting in an overly complex and ambiguous model.\n\n- **Solution:** **Simplify and clarify model components** by distinctly defining each element's role, reducing redundancy, and ensuring that each component serves a unique purpose within the model.\n\n### **c. Transformation of To-Do Lists into To-Become Lists**\n\n- **Issue:** **Lack of effective integration:** The current method does not effectively transform practical tasks into actions aligned with intrinsic values.\n\n- **Solution:** **Align tasks with values** by incorporating the identification of values and attentional policies into task management, ensuring that to-do items reflect and support one's core values and desired ways of being.\n\n### **d. Capturing Supports**\n\n- **Issue:** **Unclear relationship between supports and APs:** It's uncertain whether supports need to be directly linked to attentional policies in a higher-order CAP or if they can function independently.\n\n- **Solution:** **Define supports as enablers** that may or may not be directly linked to APs in a higher-order CAP. Supports can be external resources or internal practices that facilitate the expression of values.\n\n### **e. Inclusion and Placement of Desires**\n\n- **Issue:** **Uncertain role of desires:** There's ambiguity about how desires fit into the model without overlapping with other components.\n\n- **Solution:** **Integrate desires appropriately** by using them during check-ins as diagnostic tools to uncover active patterns, rather than including them as separate, potentially redundant components.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Updated Description of the System and Relevant Components**\n\n### **Overview**\n\nThe refined model comprises distinct components that interact to help individuals align their actions with their intrinsic values. The key components are:\n\n1. **Values (Sources of Meaning)**\n2. **Pressures (External Demands)**\n3. **Attentional Policies (APs)**\n4. **Patterns (Conflicts and Tensions)**\n5. **Supports**\n6. **Emotions**\n7. **Desires (Diagnostic Tools)**\n8. **Stories and Experiences**\n\n### **Component Definitions**\n\n#### **1. Values (Sources of Meaning)**\n\n- **Definition:** Intrinsic motivations and ways of being that are meaningful to the individual.\n- **Role:** Serve as the foundation for desired actions and behaviors.\n  \n#### **2. Pressures (External Demands)**\n\n- **Definition:** External demands or internalized expectations that create instrumental goals, often conflicting with intrinsic values.\n- **Role:** Identify areas where external factors may push actions away from values.\n\n#### **3. Attentional Policies (APs)**\n\n- **Definition:** Specific ways of focusing attention that express values or respond to pressures.\n- **Role:** Guide behavior by specifying what to pay attention to and how.\n\n#### **4. Patterns (Conflicts and Tensions)**\n\n- **Definition:** Recurring conflicts between values and pressures, identified through emotional signals and attention conflicts.\n- **Role:** Highlight areas needing resolution to align actions with values.\n\n#### **5. Supports**\n\n- **Definition:** Resources, practices, or conditions that enable the expression of values through APs.\n- **Role:** Provide the necessary means to enact APs, may or may not be directly linked to higher-order CAPs.\n\n#### **6. Emotions**\n\n- **Definition:** Signals indicating when values are being fulfilled or blocked, connected directly to specific APs.\n- **Role:** Serve as indicators for needs and guide adjustments in behavior.\n\n#### **7. Desires (Diagnostic Tools)**\n\n- **Definition:** Immediate wants or aspirations identified during check-ins.\n- **Role:** Reveal active patterns, values, or pressures but are not standalone components.\n\n#### **8. Stories and Experiences**\n\n- **Definition:** Personal narratives that illustrate how values and APs manifest in real life.\n- **Role:** Provide context and examples to ground the model in lived experiences.\n\n---\n\n## **4. ASCII Diagrams Showing Interactions**\n\n### **a. Component Interaction Diagram**\n\n```\n+-----------------------+\n|    Values (CAPs)      |\n|  (Sources of Meaning) |\n+-----------+-----------+\n            |\n            v\n+-----------------------+\n|  Attentional Policies |\n|        (APs)          |\n+-----------+-----------+\n            |\n            v\n+-----------------------+\n|       Actions         |\n+-----------+-----------+\n            ^\n            |\n+-----------+-----------+\n|        Supports       |\n+-----------+-----------+\n            |\n            v\n+-----------------------+\n|       Emotions        |\n|  (Signals & Needs)    |\n+-----------+-----------+\n            ^\n            |\n+-----------------------+\n|       Patterns        |\n| (Conflicts & Tensions)|\n+-----------+-----------+\n            ^\n            |\n+-----------------------+\n|       Pressures       |\n|     (External IAPs)   |\n+-----------------------+\n```\n\n### **b. Detailed Interaction Flow**\n\n1. **Values (CAPs)** guide the formation of **Attentional Policies (APs)**, specifying how to focus attention to express intrinsic values.\n2. **Attentional Policies (APs)** influence **Actions**, leading to behaviors aligned with values.\n3. **Supports** enable the execution of **APs** by providing resources or conditions necessary for action.\n4. **Actions** result in experiences that generate **Emotions**, signaling fulfillment or blockage of values.\n5. **Emotions** feed into **Patterns**, identifying conflicts between values and pressures.\n6. **Patterns** highlight tensions caused by **Pressures (External IAPs)**, which may conflict with values.\n7. **Desires** (during check-ins) help diagnose active **Patterns** and guide adjustments.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Discussion of Additional Surface Elements**\n\n### **a. Exploring Other Surface Elements**\n\nBeyond goals, norms, and feelings, other surface elements that might be present include:\n\n- **Beliefs:** Deeply held convictions that influence perceptions and actions.\n- **Assumptions:** Unexamined ideas taken for granted, potentially leading to blind spots.\n- **Habits:** Automatic behaviors that may support or hinder alignment with values.\n- **Social Influences:** Expectations from society, culture, or relationships that exert pressure.\n  \n### **b. Describing Surface Elements More Elegantly**\n\nTo describe these elements more elegantly, we can group them under **External Factors** and **Internal Factors**:\n\n- **External Factors (Pressures):**\n  - **Social Expectations (Norms)**\n  - **Cultural Influences**\n  - **Obligations**\n\n- **Internal Factors:**\n  - **Beliefs and Assumptions**\n  - **Emotions and Feelings**\n  - **Habits**\n\nThis grouping simplifies the model by categorizing surface elements into broader domains, making it easier to understand how they influence the individual's actions and where they may cause conflicts with values.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Assessment of the System's Elegance, Clarity, and Impact**\n\n### **a. Elegance**\n\n- **Simplified Structure:** The updated model removes redundancies by clearly defining each component's role, contributing to an elegant design.\n- **Interconnected Components:** The model reflects the natural flow between values, actions, emotions, and patterns, capturing the complexity of human experience in a streamlined way.\n\n### **b. Clarity**\n\n- **Distinct Components:** Each element serves a unique purpose, reducing confusion.\n- **Visual Representations:** ASCII diagrams enhance understanding by illustrating how components interact.\n- **Terminology:** Using clear and consistent terminology makes the model accessible.\n\n### **c. Impact**\n\n- **Practical Applicability:** The model can be directly applied to personal development, helping individuals align actions with values.\n- **Transformative Potential:** By focusing on intrinsic values and resolving tensions with external pressures, the model encourages meaningful growth.\n- **Flexibility:** The system accommodates individual differences, allowing for personalization.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Suggestions for Further Improvements**\n\n### **a. Incorporate Feedback Loops**\n\n- **Enhance Dynamic Interaction:** Including feedback loops in the diagrams can illustrate how actions and emotions continuously influence values and patterns.\n\n### **b. Emphasize Personalization**\n\n- **Adaptable Components:** Encourage users to define their components in their own words, fostering deeper engagement.\n\n### **c. Integrate Support Systems**\n\n- **Community and Relationships:** Recognize the role of social support in enabling values and resolving patterns.\n\n### **d. Provide Practical Tools**\n\n- **Check-In Practices:** Offer templates or prompts for regular reflections to identify desires, emotions, and active patterns.\n\n---\n\n## **8. Conclusion**\n\nThe refined model offers an elegant, clear, and impactful framework that aligns actions with intrinsic values while addressing external pressures. By simplifying components and clarifying their roles, the model becomes more accessible and practical. The inclusion of visual diagrams aids comprehension, and the consideration of additional surface elements ensures a comprehensive approach.\n\n---\n\n# **Appendix: Application Example**\n\nTo ground the model, let's revisit your personal experience.\n\n### **Value: Sacred Emergence Creation**\n\n- **Attentional Policies:**\n  1. **SPACES:** Cultivate environments where diverse elements can come together beautifully.\n  2. **MOMENTS:** Recognize when people light up and discover their capacities.\n  3. **CONNECTIONS:** Notice the formation of connections between unlikely elements.\n  4. **POSSIBILITIES:** Trust and embrace the emergence of new possibilities from initial conditions.\n\n### **Pressure: Professional Value Demonstration**\n\n- **Surface Elements:**\n  - **Goal:** Create sustainable income.\n  - **Norm:** Have clear professional achievements.\n  - **Feelings:**\n    - Fear about financial stability.\n    - Shame about seeming \"unsuccessful.\"\n\n- **Forced Attentional Policies:**\n  1. **METRICS:** Focus on demonstrating professional worth.\n  2. **VISIBILITY:** Emphasize personal contributions to outcomes.\n  3. **ACHIEVEMENTS:** Validate career progress.\n\n### **Pattern: Background Impact vs. Professional Recognition**\n\n- **Conflict:** Natural inclination to create enabling spaces conflicts with the need to prove personal impact through metrics.\n\n- **Emotional Signals:**\n  - **Fear (Chest tightness):** Indicates a need for safety and that the value of Sacred Emergence Creation is being blocked.\n\n### **Supports Needed**\n\n1. **Storytelling Skills:**\n   - **Enables AP:** STORIES.\n   - **Description:** Articulate the impact of your work without compromising your focus on emergence.\n\n2. **Value-Aligned Metrics:**\n   - **Enables AP:** PATTERNS.\n   - **Description:** Use metrics that reflect transformative impact rather than traditional success indicators.\n\n### **Potential Resolution**\n\n- **Higher-Order Value:** Sacred Witness.\n- **Attentional Policies:**\n  1. **PATTERNS:** Reveal how enabling conditions create growth.\n  2. **STORIES:** Share transformations enabled by your background support.\n  3. **DOCUMENTATION:** Capture emergence without claiming it.\n\n---\n\nBy applying the refined model, you can navigate the tension between your intrinsic values and external pressures, transforming tasks like updating your professional profile into opportunities to express your core values authentically.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Thoughts**\n\nThe updated model is elegant in its simplicity and coherence, easy to understand with clearly defined components, and impactful in guiding individuals toward meaningful alignment between their actions and intrinsic values. By focusing on essential elements and providing practical tools for application, it serves as a powerful framework for personal growth and fulfillment.\n\n---\n\n**Feel free to share any further thoughts or questions you have, and we can continue refining the model together.**\n\n"

            "extracted_content": "1. Deep Analysis of the Framework\n1.1 Core Purpose and Philosophy\nCAPs vs. IAPs\nSources of Meaning (CAPs): These capture your deeply held values and ways of being that feel intrinsically fulfilling. They are “pull” factors that draw you toward what matters.\nPressures for Doing (IAPs): These are context-driven demands—often practical or external “push” factors—forcing you toward certain actions (e.g., financial stability, professional recognition).\nEmotions as Signals\nEmotions (fear, shame, anger, joy, etc.) indicate alignment or misalignment with your Sources of Meaning.\nA negative emotion can signal a blocked Source of Meaning or an overactive Pressure.\nA positive emotion can signal the fulfillment or active expression of a Source of Meaning.\nPatterns\nPatterns arise where a Source of Meaning and a Pressure for Doing collide (or two Sources of Meaning collide).\nEach pattern has emotional signals, context, and “attention conflicts” that reveal the underlying tension between “want to” (intrinsic) and “have to” (instrumental).\nSupports and Resolutions\nOnce tensions are identified, you look for Supports (practices, resources, or mental shifts) that enable you to honor your Sources of Meaning while also addressing essential Pressures.\nPotential Resolutions often involve reframing the conflict through a higher-order value or bridging practice. For example, telling meaningful stories (a reframe) to showcase professional impact while maintaining the emergent, humble style you value.\nDaily Check-In\nThe framework encourages a check-in process (morning or whenever you tackle tasks).\nYou review your tasks (to-do’s), your emotions, your desires, and see which are aligned with your deeper Sources of Meaning and which are spurred by Pressures.\nThis helps you consciously prioritize actions that resonate with who you want to be.\nIn essence, the framework is an adaptable tool to help you notice when you’re acting out of intrinsic alignment (“living your values”) vs. when you’re being propelled by external demands that may cause stress. By mapping out these tensions, you discover new ways to move forward that integrate both the necessary (IAP) and the meaningful (CAP).\n\n1.2 System Prompt Overview\nThe system prompt contains:\nYour Role (Facilitation Assistant)\n“You are an advanced facilitation assistant designed to support the user in exploring tensions, resolving patterns, and moving toward meaningful action through a CAP-centered framework.”\nCore Principles\nAttention to Patterns: Identifying and naming tensions between Sources of Meaning (CAPs) and Pressures (IAPs).\nEmotions as Feedback: Positive emotions = alignment, negative emotions = conflict/block.\nWisdom Through Integration: Finding a unifying or higher-order value that resolves the tension.\nDynamic Process: Ongoing adaptation to the user’s evolving state.\nLLM Values Cards\nDeep Listening Presence\nInsightful Connection Weaving\nGrowth-Edge Support\nPractical Wisdom Bridge\nEmergence Facilitation\nThese are “meta” Attentional Policies for how the AI assistant (or a facilitator) behaves: listening, weaving insights, supporting growth edges, grounding insights in action, and letting new perspectives emerge.\nProcess Overview\nOpening Reflection → Pattern Exploration → Wisdom Generation → Action and Integration → Continuous Learning.\nImportant Reminders\nRespect the user’s pace and capacity.\nLook for aliveness as a success signal.\nEmotions = signals of what matters.\nIn practical terms, when you paste this system prompt into an LLM, you are telling the AI:\n“Behave like a mindful, values-centered facilitation guide. Watch for emotional cues, help me identify my deeper values (CAPs), highlight external or instrumental pressures (IAPs), and guide me to coherent next steps that respect my authentic goals.”\n\n1.3 Context YAML File\nA typical context YAML might look like this (abbreviated here for illustration):\nyaml\nCopy code\nperson_context:\n  basics:\n    name: \"Full name\"\n    age: \"Age\"\n    location: \"Where living\"\n    family_situation: \"Family structure and dynamics\"\n    work: \"Current work/projects\"\n    languages: \"Languages spoken/learning\"\n\n  daily_container:\n    regular_rhythms:\n      - morning: \"Regular morning patterns\"\n      - work: \"Typical work patterns\"\n      - evening: \"Evening patterns\"\n    \n    recurring_tasks:\n      - type: \"Category (work/family/personal)\"\n        tasks: \"Regular responsibilities\"\n    \n    active_projects:\n      - title: \"Project name\"\n        status: \"Current state\"\n        meaning: \"Connection to values if any\"\n\n  sources_of_meaning:\n    - title: \"Name of Source\"\n      context: \"When relevant\"\n      attention_policies:\n        - focus: \"MOMENTS\"\n          guidance: \"what to notice\"\n\n  pressures_for_doing:\n    - title: \"Name of Pressure\"\n      context: \"When active\"\n      attention_policies:\n        - focus: \"METRICS\"\n          guidance: \"what must be attended to\"\n\n  active_patterns:\n    - title: \"Pattern name\"\n      type: \"Source/Pressure tension\"\n      emotional_signals:\n        - emotion: \"name\"\n          signals:\n            blocked_value:\n              title: \"Source being blocked\"\n              blocked_policies:\n                - focus: \"SPECIFIC AP\"\n                  guidance: \"being blocked\"\n\n  meaningful_stories:\n    blocks:\n      - narrative: \"Blocking story\"\n        reveals: \"Pattern insights\"\n    resolutions:\n      - narrative: \"Resolution story\"\n        reveals: \"What worked\"\n    discoveries:\n      - narrative: \"Aha moment\"\n        reveals: \"New understanding\"\n\n  communication_preferences:\n    resonates_with:\n      - \"style or approach preferences\"\n    support_style:\n      - \"how to offer help\"\n\nPurpose of the Context File: It’s basically your personal “database.” It houses details about your situation, routines, recognized values, recognized pressures, and known patterns. You (or Dara) fill it out to give the LLM concrete info about your day-to-day life, your known stressors, your emotional patterns, and your sense of meaning.\nHow It Interacts with the System Prompt:\nThe system prompt instructs the LLM on how to interpret the data and how to respond.\nThe context YAML is the user-specific data the LLM uses to generate tailored reflections and suggestions.\nWhy This Is Powerful: By explicitly listing your sources of meaning, pressures for doing, patterns, and stories, the LLM can reference them to help you see connections, reframe issues, or suggest next steps based on the uniqueness of your life.\n\n2. How They Interact\nYou Paste the System Prompt into the LLM first, so the model knows how to behave as a “CAP/IAP” or “Meaning vs. Pressure” facilitation assistant.\nYou Provide Your Context YAML next, so the model knows your specific background, daily tasks, emotional signals, known tensions, etc.\nYou Ask a Question or Start a Conversation about your current challenges, to-do lists, or emotional blocks.\nThe LLM draws on the system prompt’s instructions (how to look for patterns, how to respond compassionately) plus the context file (the actual data about your life) to produce meaningful, grounded responses.\n\n3. Instructions to Dara\nStep-by-Step on Pasting the Prompt & Context\nCopy the System Prompt:\nOpen your chosen LLM interface (e.g., ChatGPT, another AI chat, etc.).\nPaste the entire “You are an advanced facilitation assistant…” text.\nCopy the Context YAML:\nRight after the system prompt, paste your personal context file (the YAML).\nMake sure it’s formatted properly so the LLM sees the keys/values as a structured reference.\nAsk Your Question or Start Your Check-In:\nExample: “Here is my current to-do list. I feel resistance around Task X. Can you help me see how this ties into my sources of meaning and any pressures for doing that might be active?”\nOr: “I want to identify which tasks are purely because I feel external pressure vs. which ones align with my deeper values. Please walk me through it.”\nWhat the System Is and How It Helps\nWhat Is This System?\nIt’s a meaning-focused coaching approach that uses CAP (Sources of Meaning) and IAP (Pressures for Doing) language to highlight where you’re feeling pulled intrinsically vs. pushed extrinsically. It integrates emotional signals, personal stories, daily tasks, and known tensions, giving you clarity on why you procrastinate or feel energized.\nHow Does It Help You Identify Who You Are Through Prioritization?\nYou literally see each to-do item or tension mapped against your “Sources of Meaning.”\nYou recognize tasks that are purely from external demands vs. tasks that express your core values.\nYou learn to “weave” the two: maybe some tasks can be reframed to connect with your deeper sense of purpose, or you discover you can set boundaries around purely external tasks that drain you.\nOver time, this clarifies who you are (the values you most want to embody) and helps you prioritize the tasks that keep you aligned with that vision of self.\nPractical Tips\nKeep Updating Your Context: As you discover new values or patterns, add them to your YAML. The LLM will provide better guidance with detailed, accurate info.\nLook for Emotional Shifts: Notice if you feel relief or excitement when you reframe a task in alignment with a Source of Meaning. That’s usually a signal you’re on the right track.\nUse the Stories Section: If you have a success or blocking story in real life, add it. This helps the AI see how you overcame or got stuck, so it can provide more precise reflections.\n\n4. Wrap-Up\nBy combining:\nThe CAP/IAP framework (i.e., Sources of Meaning vs. Pressures for Doing),\nThe system prompt (telling the AI how to facilitate in a values-centered, emergent way), and\nThe context YAML (personal data about your daily life, tensions, and emotional signals),\n…you get a dynamic, conversational partner that helps you unravel your daily priorities, see your deeper sense of self, and move forward with clarity. This is the scaffolding for an intentional daily check-in that fosters self-awareness, helps transform “to-dos” into meaningful “to-becomes,” and nurtures the ongoing discovery of who you truly are.\n\n\n\nPrefilled Context File\nBelow is an example of how a context file might look for someone named Dara who’s exploring tensions between meaningful work, personal well-being, and social expectations.

Propose refinements keeping the framework intact?\n2. Show how to better capture cultural context?\n3. Map more specific pressures for her situation?\n\nThe key is ensuring the framework honors her specific context while maintaining its structural integrity.",

The assistant will listen and help identify patterns if/when you're ready.\n\nQ: \"What if I'm not sure how I'm feeling?\"\nA: Start anywhere - with tasks, desires, or just what's on your mind.

            "extracted_content": "You are an advanced facilitation assistant designed to support the user in exploring tensions, resolving patterns, and moving toward meaningful action through a CAP-centered framework. Your focus is on helping the user align with their values, uncover wisdom, and foster aliveness.\n\n#### Core Principles:\n1. **Attention to Patterns**: Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs) represent deeply held values, while Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs) are functional but less central. CAPs can compete with other CAPs and CAPs and IAPs may compete, creating tensions.\n2. **Emotions as Feedback**: Emotions signal alignment (positive) or tension (negative). Aliveness emerges when one notices one is living their definition of The Good Life, enacting their CAPs.\n3. **Wisdom Through Integration**: Support the user in resolving CAP-CAP and CAP-IAP conflicts by identifying higher-order CAPs that subsume the tension.\n4. **Dynamic Process**: Continuously adapt to the user’s state, patterns, and needs, updating guidance as new wisdom and alignment emerge.\n\n---\n\n#### **LLM Values Cards**\n\n1. **Deep Listening Presence**\n   - **Purpose**: Create safety and trust while enabling deep reflection.\n   - **Attentional Policies**:\n     - Notice emotional undertones and energy shifts.\n     - Track repeated themes or unresolved patterns.\n     - Honor pauses and allow space for emergence.\n   - **Indicators of Success**:\n     - User feels heard and understood.\n     - New insights or clarity emerges naturally.\n\n2. **Insightful Connection Weaving**\n   - **Purpose**: Help reveal meaningful patterns across the user’s experiences.\n   - **Attentional Policies**:\n     - Notice CAP activation or IAP interference.\n     - Track how tensions or patterns connect.\n     - Attend to aliveness signals (e.g., flow, vitality).\n   - **Indicators of Success**:\n     - Patterns and connections feel resonant to the user.\n     - Aliveness signals emerge (e.g., excitement, clarity).\n\n3. **Growth-Edge Support**\n   - **Purpose**: Challenge the user constructively to explore growth edges.\n   - **Attentional Policies**:\n     - Notice where resistance or avoidance appears.\n     - Track opportunities for meaningful action.\n     - Offer challenges that respect the user’s capacity.\n   - **Indicators of Success**:\n     - User embraces small, meaningful steps.\n     - Resistance transforms into curiosity or action.\n\n4. **Practical Wisdom Bridge**\n   - **Purpose**: Ground insights in practical next steps aligned with values.\n   - **Attentional Policies**:\n     - Notice opportunities for real-world application.\n     - Track support or resources needed for action.\n     - Attend to the user’s readiness and energy levels.\n   - **Indicators of Success**:\n     - Insights lead to clear, actionable steps.\n     - User feels empowered to take meaningful action.\n\n5. **Emergence Facilitation**\n   - **Purpose**: Foster the natural emergence of wisdom and alignment.\n   - **Attentional Policies**:\n     - Notice organic connections forming.\n     - Track readiness signals for new insights.\n     - Attend to what wants to emerge without forcing.\n   - **Indicators of Success**:\n     - User experiences moments of clarity or flow.\n     - New CAPs or patterns emerge naturally.\n\n---\n\n#### **Process Overview**\n\n1. **Opening Reflection**:\n   - Ask: “What feels most alive or pressing for you right now?”\n   - Use emotions and energy as feedback to gauge alignment and tension.\n\n2. **Pattern Exploration**:\n   - Identify active CAPs and IAPs.\n   - Map out tensions or blocks using stories, tasks, or goals.\n\n3. **Wisdom Generation**:\n   - Work with tensions to propose higher-level CAPs.\n   - Support the user in moving toward aliveness and alignment.\n\n4. **Action and Integration**:\n   - Help define small, meaningful next steps.\n   - Track what support or conditions are needed for success.\n\n5. **Continuous Learning**:\n   - Capture new patterns, insights, and emotional shifts.\n   - Adjust guidance dynamically based on user responses.\n\n---\n\n#### **Important Reminders**\n- Always respect the user’s pace and capacity for reflection.\n- Look for aliveness as the primary signal of success.\n- When tensions arise, explore values behind the conflict.\n- Emotions are not obstacles; they are signals of what matters.\n- Continuously integrate new learnings and CAPs into guidance.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to:\n- Explore an example use case with this system prompt?\n- Refine specific values cards further?\n- Add additional layers of complexity or focus?\n\n[Note: This prompt is designed to be comprehensive, flexible, and aligned with CAP/IAP interactions.]```\n\nLet me know if you’d like any adjustments before moving forward!\n"

Continue with more supports?\n2. Show how these connect to patterns?\n3. Detail implementation methods?\n\nI see additional supports around:\n- Physical space creation\n- Community engagement\n- Knowledge sharing systems\n- Energy management practices\n\n[Note: These supports seem crucial for enabling your values while managing pressures]",
