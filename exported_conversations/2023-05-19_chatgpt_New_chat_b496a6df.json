      "content": "Can you write this as a friendly modern fun business correspondence:\nIt's been a while since I last reached out and we've been hard at work developing a more concrete proposal for bringing values to life at work. While discussing with Chris we discussed the idea that values alignment has clear business value and we've crafted this pilot program to measure and further establish the business case. We'd love to discuss how Bloom can pilot this program with LaunchGood and bring leadership to the world on the importance of values at work and how they have concrete business outcomes for our most important KPIs. Reach out and schedule a call whenever you'd like where: https://bloom.pm/meet/bilal or ping me to riff on WhatsApp here. \n\nI'm attaching the proposal, please review and give me your feedback as this is a pilot we're motivated to find a program structure and price point that works for you and your team\nThanks",
