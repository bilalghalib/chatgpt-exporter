Exploring these characteristics could improve architectural\ndesign knowledge. This paper investigated the geometry and positioning of\nthe built-up massing surrounding the courtyard to understand their effect on\nthe formation of the covered and open outdoor spaces. Accordingly, it\nestablished a new understanding of the courtyard spatial characteristics and\ndesigned a model that simulated the possible courtyard forms. The model\nsimulates 149 courtyard patterns and depicts diagrammatic ground and first\nfloor plans for houses containing these courtyards. Borrowing the extracted\ncourtyard forms could improve the building's functional performance in\ncontemporary architectural design. In subsequent studies, the evaluation of\nthe environmental efficiency of the Iraqi traditional courtyard houses should\nnot be limited to the model with a courtyard surrounded from all sides by\nwalls of equal height. The evaluation may be conducted to the extracted\ntypes in the paper simulation model, as they are more representative of\nreality.\nDisciplinary: Architecture Science & Engineering.\n©2021 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.\nCite This Article:\nAlmumar, M. and Baper, S.

This paper supports Warren’s and Fethi (1982) conclusion, about 30 years before,\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 2\nthat TIH had not been analyzed or documented scientifically. Much of the TIH essential orders and\nfeatures have not been explored yet; the Cy morphology is one of these features. This paper studied\nthe available documented architectural drawings and photos of local traditional houses. A better\nunderstanding of the Cy form may improve architectural design decisions concerning the\ninteraction between indoor and outdoor spaces. Sthapak (2014) showed that, historically, the Cy\nstyle has been most popular in residential architecture in all climatic regions. Özkan (2006)\nclarified that Cy planning remains a considerable design tool for architects and designers to link\nthe present with history in consecutive continuity. Auda (1988, p125), Wazeri (2013), and El\nHarrouni (2015) believed that Cy form plays a positive role in the house thermal performance. This\npaper is complementary to previous researches, which studied two building orders of the TIH\nconcerned with the building materials in the external envelope (Ishik University 2018) and building\norientation (Ishik University 2019).\n2 Literature Review\nFrequently, the current literature supports the notion that Cy aspect ratio alone can describe\nCy form of the TIH. This perception implies that the Cy is an unroofed room in the house, which is\nnothing but a particular case that is less frequent in reality. Vedhajanani and Lilly (2016) adopted\nthat understanding when they clearly defined a Cy as an opening inside the building. Jaim (n.d.)\nalso described Cy as a room without a roof, and Abbas et al. (2016) considered it similar all over the\nworld but with varied attributes. Through the Cy evaluating of the environmental and functional\nperformance, Evans (1980), Al-Zarkani (2017), Al-Jameel and Hassan (2012), and Kareem (2012)\nhad not clarified their perception of its form, which may imply the definition of an unroofed room.\nOn the contrary, the Cy form of the TIH is of varying geometries that influence its spatial,\nenvironmental, and visual characteristics significantly. Fouda (2014) asserted that controlling the\nphysical character of the built-up masses and the distances between them in the urban space would\npositively direct the urban form to a livable and sustainable entity.\nMurad (2015) and Auda (1988, p16-19) defined Cy more precisely as an outdoor space\nsurrounded from all or some sides by arcades that encircled by the house spaces or walls. Still, this\nperception of Cy form is not clear enough. This paper investigated the characteristics of the Cy\nform of the TIH that ensure its functional, environmental, aesthetics, and visual goals.\n3 Method\nThrough the study of the TIH’s designs, this paper found that they often contain, in addition\nto the Cy space, covered or open outdoor areas adjacent and connected to the Cy on the ground and\nfirst floor. These outdoor areas are not independent but rather constitute an extension to the Cy\nspace. They participate in performing the spatial, environmental, visual, and aesthetic functions.\nTherefore this paper studied the spatial characteristics of the Cy form and those outdoor spaces as\nintegrated into one.\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 3\nThe methodology constitutes the following three aspects: A description of the existing Cy\nstructure, the Cy morphology analysis, and the Cy simulation model.\n3.1 A Description of Courtyard Structure\nThis paper diagnosed three features that interact with each other to determine the Cy\nstructure characteristics. They are shape and dimensions at ground level, the distribution pattern\nof the built-up masses surrounding the Cy, and the geometrical properties of these built-up masses.\n3.1.1 Courtyard Shape and Dimensions at Ground Level\nOn the ground level, Cy is nearly a square to ensure a livable outdoor space and the climatic\nneeds of the residents (Warren and Fethi 1982. P48). Courtyards may sometimes take other forms\nwhen the number of their sides is more than four. Cys of equal areas usually has different shapes\ndue to the differences in their sides dimensions and or angles between them. These differences in\nshape and proportions most often follow the irregularity of the land plot. The Cy floor area of the\nTIH differs dramatically. It may range from less than 10 m\n2 \nto more than 200 m\n2 \n(see photos 5 and\n10 in Figure 5). In a survey in Al-Kadimiya (Auda 1988, p18), Cys of 10-20 m\n2 \nreached 40% of the\ntotal number, while those of 21-40 m\n2 \namounted to 32 %. 28% of Cys was of smaller or larger floor\nareas. Walls surrounding the Cys of almost 8 meters in height resulted in a vertical aspect ratio\nranging from 0.2 up to 3.4 or sometimes even more. Hence, the paper concludes that there is no\nspecific prevailing aspect ratio of Cys.\n3.1.2 Distribution Pattern of Built-Up Masses Surrounding Courtyard\n\"Built-up masses\" include the habitable indoor spaces (rooms) of the house, sheds (arcades),\nand walls surrounding the Cy. Built-up masses may occupy one or more sides of the Cy. The\ndiagrammatic arrangement of built-up massing around Cy in Figure 1 shows that each side of the\nCy may contain one or more of these built-up masses of a similar or different type. When a\nquadrilateral Cy includes a single built-up mass on every side, their number will be eight on each\nfloor, as in case 1 of Figure 1. When each side of the Cy contains two or three of these built-up\nmasses, their number will be 12 and 16, respectively, as in cases 2 and 3 of Figure 1. The Built-up\nmasses' numbers may differ on the Cy sides, as in case 4 of Figure 1.\nCase number 1 2 3 4\nNumber of built-up masses on each side of the\ncourtyard \n1 2 3 2 and 3\nConfiguration\nFigure 1: Configuration of different number of built-up masses surrounding the courtyard\nBelow is a description of the occupation pattern of these three built-up masses.\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 4\n3.1.2.1 Occupation Pattern of Inhabitable Indoor Spaces\nThis paragraph studies the number of Cy sides that contain inhabitable indoor spaces. Pole\nService (1977) reported that the Cys used in most urban areas of Iraq have the style in which the\ninhabitable indoor spaces occupy two or more sides. To specify that more precisely, the paper\ndepended on two surveys conducted in Baghdad and Erbil as follows:\nIn a part of the Al-Kadhimiya area ( in Baghdad) of one hundred and thirty traditional\nhouses, Cys surrounded by habitable indoor spaces from two or three sides count 86%, while those\nsurrounded from four sides constitute only 14% (Auda 1988, p19). In another survey of one hundred\ntraditional houses in Erbil citadel (Ishik University 2019), Cys surrounded by habitable indoor\nspaces from two or three sides count 79%, while those surrounded from four sides constitute only\n4%. A staircase, toilet, and or store usually occupy one of Cy's sides. Figure 2 illustrates the\ndistribution details of the two surveys.\nFigure 1: Configuration of different number of built-up masses surrounding the courtyard\nThe two surveys coincide with Yousuf (1975), Al-Dioachi (1975), and Al-Jameel (2012)\nopinions that the prevailing types of Cys are those surrounded by habitable indoor spaces from 1 to\n3 sides, while those surrounded from four sides are of a limited percentage relatively. This reality\nrefutes a current thought that the habitable indoor spaces surround the Cys from all its sides. In\nsquare land plots equal to or less than 100 m \n2\n, the inhabitable indoor spaces may surround the Cy\nfrom one or two adjacent sides (Yousuf 1975; Al-Dioachi 1975) as in drawings 1 and 4 of Figure 3. If\nthe land plot shape is suitably elongated, the habitable indoor spaces may occupy two opposite\nsides in the Cy (Warren and Fethi 1982) as in drawings 2 and 3 of Figure 3. In medium-size land\nplots of approximately 100 m\n2 \nup to 150 m \n2\n, indoor spaces may surround Cys from one, two, or\nthree sides. In square land plots of more than 200 m\n2 \n, they may occupy four sides of the Cy's or\nfewer, as in drawings 5 and 6 of Figure 3. That is consistent with what Yousuf (1975) clarified that\nsmall or medium-sized Cys are often surrounded by indoor spaces from one, two, or sometimes\nthree sides depending on their area and shape. Each Cy's side, equal to or less than 5 m in length,\noften contains one habitable indoor space, whereas longer sides usually have two or more.\n17\n5\n43\n31\n4\n0\n23\n23\n40\n14\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nOne side\nTwo opposite sides\nTwo adjacent sides\nThree sides\nFour sides\nPercentage of the number of the occupied sides of courtyards\nKadimiyah\ndistrict\nErbil citadel\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 5\n1.

They perform as terraces on\nthe first floor (Warren and Fethi 1982) and influence the indoor and outdoor environments (Choul\n& Jun 2016). These covered outdoor spaces are adjacent to the rooms or land plot boundary with\nthe supporting columns or walls on the Cy sides. Narrow Cys may be naked of these spaces on its\nlong sides. In addition to their living function, the outdoor open spaces on the first floor allow the\nsun to penetrate to lower levels. The covered outdoor spaces connect rooms on the first floor.\nBesides, they provide spatial and environmental diversity, expand the visual field of the Cy, and\nenrich the house aesthetics.\n3.1.2.3 Walls Surrounding Courtyard on Land-Plot Boundaries\nWhen any side of the Cy does not contain an indoor space or a shed, walls of two stories in\nheight will occupy these sides. Stair and services as a toilet, bathroom, and kitchen usually occupy\nadjacent areas to these walls.\n3.1.3 Geometrical Properties of the Built-up Masses\nThis paragraph analyzes the geometry and positioning of the built-up massing surrounding\nthe Cy. The paper identified seven types of built-up massing labeled from (A) to (G), as explicated\nbelow. The diagrammatic drawings in Figure 4 depict these geometries. Photos in Figure 5 show\nsimilar existing cases.\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 6\nFigure 4: Basic built-up masses surrounding the courtyard.\n1 2 3\n4 5 6 7\n8 9 10\n11 12 13\nFigure 5: Examples of TIH showing types of built-up massing geometries surrounding the courtyard\nBuilt-up\nmass\nA room on\nthe ground\nfloor\nRooms on two\nfloors\nA room and\na shed above\nA shed\non the\nground\nfloor\nTwo sheds\non two\nfloors, or a\ntwo-storey\nshed (Ewan)\nA two-storey\nwall with or\nwithout\nservice rooms\nin front\nA room on\nthe 1\nst \nfloor\nwith an\noutdoor\nspace under\nOverlookin\ng the alley\nand\ncourtyard\nOverlookin\ng the\ncourtyard\nName \nA B C D E F G\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 7\nA- An indoor habitable space (room) on the ground floor with an accessible roof as in photo 1.\nB- Indoor habitable spaces on two-floor with an accessible roof, as in photos 2, 7, 8, and 9.\nC- An indoor habitable space on the ground floor shaded by an accessible roof on the first floor as in photos 3,\n7, and 10.\nD- An outdoor space on the ground floor shaded by an accessible roof supported by columns or walls with\nopenings on the side of the Cy, as in photo 1.\nE- An outdoor space similar to (D) but shaded with a roof, as in photos 2, 6, 9, and 10.

Photos\n2, 3, and 4 of Figure 5 show the direct connection. Photos 1, 7, and 9 show the indirect connection\nthrough the covered outdoor spaces. These two types were diagrammatically represented in Figure\n6 and labeled with the numbers 1 and 2, respectively. Some TIH contains a single habitable space\non the land plot corner, adjacent to similar rooms from two sides. One side of this corner space\nextends to overlook the Cy directly, as shown in room number 3 in Figure 6.\n1 \nBuilt-up mass directly overlooking Cy\n2 \nCorner built-up mass indirectly overlooking Cy through covered outdoor space\n3 \nCorner built-up mass partially overlooking Cy through the extension on an adjacent built-up mass\n4 \nCovered or open outdoor space\n5 \nCourtyard\nFigure 6: The scheme of built-up massing interacting with the Cy\nThe used cases of the habitable rooms that occupy only one corner of the land plot in the\nTIH were shown in cells 1, 3, 4, and 7, in the first row of Figure 7. The second row shows the\nunimplemented cases where the number of habitable corner rooms exceeds a single one.\nThis paper adopted these attributes, which prevail over the studied drawings.\nFigure 7: The employed occupation of habitable rooms in respect to the courtyard sides\nNo. of the Cy’s\noccupied sides \n4 3 \n2 \nLegend:\nHabitable rooms\n(A, B, C, or G\ntype of built-up mass)\nCourtyard\nA shed or wall\n(D, E, or F type of\nbuilt-up mass )\nOccupation of themaximum habitablespaces in the land plot\n \nApplica\nble\ncases\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nNon-\napplicab\nle \n-\n3\n1\n2\n1\n5\n2\n4\n4 4\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 8\n3.2 Courtyard Morphology Analysis\nThis paragraph analyzes the Cy form and structure characteristics through the geometry and\npositioning of the built-up massing surrounding the Cy.\n3.2.1 Cy Form\nThe Cy form expresses the following spatial characteristics:\n1. the quantity and pattern of openness towards the sky,\n2. the vision extension through the adjacent outdoor spaces,\n3. the Cy facades diversity.\nBesides, Cy form shares the passive systems by controlling the environmental performance\nof the house. The exposure extent of Cy to the sky is associated with the opened areas in the roof\nslabs on the first and second floor and the relative locations of these openings. These two openings,\nin most cases, do not coincide with the shape and dimensions of the CY determined by the walls on\nthe ground floor, as shown in photo 11 of Figure 5.\nThe vision extension occurs when the Cy surrounding sheds and arcades allow the view to\ncontinue towards the adjacent spaces on both floors, as in photos 2, 5, 6, 9, and 13 of Figure 5.\nThese outdoor spaces provide spaciousness, especially in narrow Cys, and they together form an\nintegrated unity.\nThe variety in the facades overlooking the Cy is due to the multiple types and locations of\nbuilt-up massing, as in photo 9 of Figure 5.\n3.2.2 Scheme of the Built-Up Massing Occupation\nAs a result of the study in chapter 3.1, this paper identified the scheme of the occupation of\nthe seven types of built-up massing surrounding the Cys of a single built-up mass on each side. The\nsides occupation varied according to the built-up massing type, as follows:\n1. Any one of the built-up masses (A) and (B) may exist in one or more sides of the Cy. Thus, any group of\nthe masses (C, D, E, F) may occupy three sides as a maximum.\n2. Any one of the built-up masses (C, D, E, and F) could occupy one, two, or three sides of the Cy as a\nmaximum, or none of the sides. The masses (D and E) may occupy an area next to the indoor spaces or\nboundaries of the land plot.\n3. The built-up mass (G) might occupy one or two sides of the Cy as a maximum or no side at all. The reason\nfor the occupation limitations is to override the inconsistency with the performance function of\nhousing. Examples of these inconsistencies are: the hanging room (G) occupies three or four sides of\nthe Cy, the wall (F), and the shades (D, E) surround the Cy from all its sides. Table 1 summarizes the\noccupation scheme.\nTable 1: Occupation scheme of the built-up masses surrounding the courtyard.\nBuilt-up massing designation \nA B C D E F G\nNo. of built-up massing occupying\nthe four sides of courtyard sides\nMin \n1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nMax \n4 4 3 3 3 3 2\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 9\n3.3 Simulation Model of a Courtyard\nThis paper designed a model simulating the Cy form patterns of the TIH to develop a clear\nperception. The model assumed that the shape and dimensions of the Cy are constant, and thus the\nsimulation will be limited to the types and locations of the built-up massing surrounding the Cy.\nThe model also assumed that the Cy in the plan is a square shape. Each side contains one of the\nseven built-up masses defined in chapter 3.2. Therefore, the maximum number of built-up massing\nin the land plot is eight, as shown in Figure 1, case 1. The reason for this assumption is to simplify\nCy forms extraction by choosing the simplest case of formation probabilities. Small land plots\nconstitute the most prevailing ones in the traditional fabric, as explicated in section (3.1.1). The\nmodel complied with the restrictions in Table 1 regarding the occupation of the built-up masses\ntypes surrounding the Cy. The exception is the repetition of the two built-up masses (F and G) that\nchanged to 2 and 1 instead of 3 and 2. The reason for that change is that in Cys that contain a single\nbuilt-up mass on every side, the researcher detected no case in which the number of built-up\nmassing (F and G) exceeds two or one, respectively. As a result, the adopted occupation scheme in\nthe model is according to Table 2.\nTable 2 Constraints of the built-up masses occupation on the courtyard's sides\nBuilt-up massing designation A B C D E F G\nNo. of Built-up massing occupying\nthe four sides of the courtyard\nMin. 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nMax. 4 3 3 3 3 2 1\nAll the habitable rooms in the simulation model, similar to the studied samples, overlook the\nCy directly or indirectly.\nThe model, in Figure 8, shows the diagrammatic ground floor-plan probabilities when the\nnumber of Cy sides occupied by built-up massing is two, three, or four. It is worth noting that the\nmodel excluded the cases in which built-up massing occupy only one side of the Cy. Those cases\nexist when the Cy side contains more than a single built-up mass. Next to the ground-floor\ndiagrammatic plans, in the model, are the possible patterns of the first-floor plans. Some of the\nfirst floor plans are similar to those of the ground floor. Each first-floor plan conforms with all the\nground-floor ones and creates together particular cases. Therefore, multiplying the number of\nground floor plan patterns by the first-floor ones resulted in the total of Cy patterns number.\nThe model excluded some inconsistent cases, which will be specified hereafter.\nExcluded patterns\ndue to\nFirst floor patternsGround floor patterns\nOccupation\ntype\nHanging\nrooms >\none\nRepetiti\non\n-\n1.7-1.9\n=3\n--\n1.Two\nadjacen\nt sides\n7\n65432\n1\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 10\n-\n-\n9\n8\n21\n-Net number of patterns =2*9‒3=15.\n-\n1.7-1.9,\n2.4-2.6,\n2.9\n=7\n--\n2.

The first cell indicates the\noccupation type of Cy sides. That cell contains one of the symbols (L, ‖, C, and □) that expresses\nthe occupation of two adjacent or opposite sides, three sides, or four, respectively. The second and\nthird cells contain the numerals of ground and first-floor plans according to the numbering in\nFigure 8. For example, (C3.7) indicates that the Cy is of type surrounded by built-up massing on\nthree sides on the ground floor and that the ground and first floor-plans numbers are 3 and 7.\nThe model excluded floor-plan patterns with more than one hanging room that does not\ncomply with the model restrictions. The last column of Figure 8 shows the number of these\npatterns highlighted in green. Their numbers are 14 and 75 in the Cys occupied by three and four\nsides, respectively. The model demonstrates and excludes, also, identical floor plans of different\ndirections, as they are considered recurring. The column before the last of Figure 8 shows the\nnumber of these floor plan patterns highlighted in green. They count 3, 7, 7, and 46 in the Cys\noccupied on two adjacents, two opposite, three, and four sides, respectively. The model subtracted\nthe sum of the excluded cases from the total number of floor-plan patterns for the four types.\nTherefore, the sum of the Cy form patterns is 149, which is more than twice the number of the\nstudied samples.\n4 Result and Discussion\nThis paper extracted 149 different configurations for the Cy form, expressed by two\ndiagrammatic ground floor and first plans, as in Figure 8. Figure 9 shows sixteen diagrammatic\ncross-section views depicting samples of the extracted Cy forms.\nThe outdoor spaces in the cross-sectional views are light blue in colour. These 16 cross-\nsections are in a sequence according to the number of outdoor spaces connected to the Cy. The\ncross-sections 1-4 contain one outdoor space connected to the Cy, cross-sections 4-12: two\noutdoor spaces, cross-sections 13-15: three outdoor spaces. Cross-section 16 is of a Cy form that\ndoes not connect with outdoor spaces. That type of Cy is erroneously sometimes referred to in the\ncurrent literature as expressing the Cy form of the TIH.\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 12\nFigure 9: Sectional views of some extracted Cy forms of the simulation model\nFigure 10 indicates some floor plans that contain Cys coinciding with some of those\nsectional views in Figure 9. Cross-sections numbers on the floor plans in Figure 10 refer to the\nnumber of the sectional view in Figure 9. These floor plans drawings represent some of the\nexamples studied in this paper. This paper identified the Cy form characteristics of the TIH that\nachieve the design objectives. The Cy often connects to one or more adjacent covered or open\noutdoor spaces located on one or two floors. These outdoor spaces interact with the Cy constituting\nmultiple harmonious forms that vary visually, environmentally, functionally, and aesthetically.\nVisually, the Cy integrated form expands the view to tackle cases of limited or narrow Cy volume.\nEnvironmentally, the form tectonic of Cy allows the sun to reach a lower level in winter. These\noutdoor spaces of different micro-climates on the ground floor, first, and roof, perform various\nfunctions throughout the year. Besides, the variety of forms creates a comfortable, livable\nenvironment.\nThe significance of the paper's findings is that it described the Cy forms of the TIHs by\ndiagrammatic floor plans and their possible configurations. Thus, the description of the Cy as a\nroom without a roof is only representing a special case that is less frequent in reality.\nTherefore, the environmental and spatial analysis of that form cannot be adopted to express\nthe TIH. The building's environmental performance programs should use the forms extracted by\nthis paper to reach reality.\nThis paper could not obtain enough floor plans documenting TIH that correspond with all\nthe Cy's extracted forms in the model due to their scarcity. Nevertheless, this paper expects that\nmost of the explored patterns of Cy form exist in reality. The types of Cy form considerably exceed\nwhat was extracted in the model when the number of built-up massing on one side of the Cy\nincreases to two or three. They also increase when the shape and dimensions of the Cy vary, such\nthat the two Cy forms are hardly similar. Many other Cy patterns can be extracted when not\nrestricted to the function of housing that the paper model followed. For example, the constraint\n1 2 3 4\n5 6 7 8\n9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 13\nconcerning the number of suspended rooms could be disregarded in buildings other than\nresidential ones.\nFigure 10: Floor plans of existing houses with Cy forms resembling the explored ones\nThe documented Cys form of the traditional houses in some neighbouring countries such as\nSyria, Egypt, and Iran, are usually more spacious and with fewer supplementing covered or open\n\nhttp://TuEngr.com \nPage | 14\noutdoor spaces than these in Iraq. The reason may be due to the exposure to minor environmental\nimpact compared to the local Iraqi one. Photos 1 and 2 in figure 11 illustrated some of those known\nCys in Syria.\n1\nhttps://muslimheritag\ne.com/the-courtyard-\nhouses-of-syria/\n2\nhttps://muslimheritage\n.com/the-courtyard-\nhouses-of-syria/\n3\nhttp://www.nexttoparchitects.\n4\nhttp://www.274b18\n33a209532a09f48\nFigure 11: photos 1 and 2: courtyard form in Syria. Photo 3 and 4: courtyard concept employed in\ncontemporary design.\n5 Conclusion\nThe TIH can provide urban forms of various characteristics and microclimates. The extracted\nCy forms achieve the spatial, environmental, visual, and aesthetical functions. The multiplicity of\nthe outdoor forms and their integration with the habitable indoor spaces play an essential role in\nacquiring the local identity and distinguishes it from the neighboring countries. These integrated\nCy forms have the inherent capacity to suit various land plot sizes by configuring multiple patterns\nensuring the design requirements.\nThis new understanding of the Cy form may help contemporary designers to borrow its\nprinciples. The Cy form variety provides the freedom to achieve better performance. Many of the Cy\nforms extracted in this paper can be inspired to suit residential, educational, commercial, and\ncommunity buildings, to name a few. Photos 3 and 4 in Figure 11 are examples of design proposals\nthat employed integrated Cy forms.\nThis paper also investigates the environmental performance of the extracted Cy form’s\npatterns. Besides, studying the Cy forms whose sides contain more than a single built-up mass.\nThese Cy forms are usually more spacious than the types extracted in this paper.\n6 Availability of Data and Material\nData can be made available by contacting the corresponding author.\n7 References\nAbass, F., Ismail, L.H. and Solla, M., 2016.
