We aim to address key targets within this goal, promoting sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation. Our quantifiable impact metrics include: 1. Land Restoration: Through partnerships with organizations like the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative (LRI) NGO, we conducted experiments on 120 trees planted in December 2023, contributing to Target 15.3 (land degradation neutrality). Future collaborations, such as the upcoming pilot project with GreenLeb in March 2024, further this goal. 2. Biodiversity Enhancement: We seek to boost biodiversity by promoting natural fertilizers. Target 15.9, emphasizing the integration of ecosystems and biodiversity into planning, guides our efforts, with a targeted 20% increase in the diversity of flora and fauna where our pellets are applied. 3. Water Conservation: Anticipating a 25% reduction in water consumption for irrigation, our pellets, by reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and enhancing soil water retention, contribute to sustainable agricultural practices. 4. Economic Empowerment: Contributing to SDG 1 and SDG 8, our initiative creates income streams for shepherds and generates jobs. We currently empower eight families in our workshop and 15 shepherd families annually. As our business expands, we aim to uplift more families out of poverty. 5. Carbon Emission Reduction: While indirectly linked to SDG 15, our efforts reduce the burning of sheep wool and the carbon footprint in agriculture, contributing to SDG 13. Over our three working years, we have successfully reduced 200 tons of CO2 emissions.Through these quantifiable goals, we envision a holistic impact aligned with SDG 15 and intersecting with other critical sustainability objectives.\tEntrepreneurship:::Tech & Innovation\t\"4.2.

Simultaneously, Lebanese farmers, particularly in regions like Aarsal, face severe economic challenges due to high input costs. Our data, for example, shows conventional fertilizer costing $278.5 per 320m², hindering profitability. We identified this dual problem through direct observation of both the pervasive waste and the struggles of local farmers. Our data analysis, demonstrating SoilPlus's ability to significantly reduce costs and increase profits (with a 293% ROI), confirmed the viability of our upcycling solution. This provides a sustainable and economically beneficial alternative, turning a waste problem into a resource for struggling farmers.\tOur Startup: GRADE A PLUS GRADE A PLUS is a Lebanese startup dedicated to transforming environmental challenges into sustainable economic opportunities. We address the pressing issue of sheep wool waste, of which Lebanon generates 2,500 tons annually, by upcycling it into high-value agricultural and other sustainable products. Recognizing the economic hardships faced by Lebanese farmers, particularly in regions like Aarsal, we've developed innovative solutions that not only mitigate waste but also enhance agricultural productivity and profitability. Our Solution: SoilPlus and SoilPlus Pro Our flagship products, SoilPlus and SoilPlus Pro, are soil enhancers made from 100% upcycled sheep wool. They offer a sustainable alternative to conventional fertilizers, addressing both environmental and economic concerns. •\tSoilPlus: As shown in the provided data, SoilPlus demonstrates exceptional cost-effectiveness. With a total cost of $194.8 per 320m², it significantly reduces input costs for farmers compared to conventional 20-20-20 fertilizer, which costs $278.5. Moreover, despite a lower initial investment, SoilPlus delivers the highest profit ($570.7) and a remarkable 293% return on investment (ROI), primarily attributed to the higher selling price per kg ($0.8) of the produce grown with it. •\tSoilPlus Pro: While slightly more costly at $221.6 per 320m², SoilPlus Pro also offers a cost-effective solution compared to conventional fertilizers. It delivers a substantial yield (1255.25 kg) and a profit of $280.5, representing a 127% ROI. Key Benefits: •\tCost Reduction: Both SoilPlus and SoilPlus Pro significantly reduce input costs for farmers compared to conventional fertilizers. •\tIncreased Profitability: SoilPlus, in particular, demonstrates a significantly higher profit margin and ROI. •\tSustainable Agriculture: By upcycling sheep wool, we reduce waste and promote environmentally friendly farming practices. •\tImproved Soil Health: Our products enhance soil structure and water retention, leading to healthier crops. •\tLocal Economic Development: We support Lebanese farmers and contribute to the economic resilience of rural communities. Our Vision: We envision a future where waste is transformed into valuable resources, and sustainable agriculture empowers Lebanese farmers.

Today, Syria is experiencing a new phase of hope and construction, as the Syrian people seek to restore their normal lives and build a better future for their future generations. However, with increasing hope, crime remains one of the main challenges that threaten security and stability. Our project, “The Smart System for Detecting and Preventing Crimes in Real Time,” comes not only as an advanced technological solution, but as part of these national efforts to rebuild a safe and stable Syria. This smart system enhances the ability of the authorities to respond quickly and effectively to crimes, which contributes to creating a safe environment in which citizens live in peace and security. The challenge lies in applying modern technological solutions to achieve the desired security in a country suffering from the consequences of war. The smart system for detecting and preventing crimes in real time relies on the use of artificial intelligence technologies and data analysis to provide accurate predictions and immediate notifications to the relevant authorities, enabling them to take the necessary measures quickly and effectively. This system is not limited to data analysis only, but also includes the use of smart devices and advanced monitoring to ensure the system is implemented comprehensively and effectively. The smart crime detection and analysis system includes an integrated system for collecting data from multiple sources such as surveillance cameras, smart sensors, and citizen reports. This data is analyzed using deep learning and neural network techniques to detect unusual patterns and suspicious behaviors, allowing authorities to take proactive measures to prevent crimes before they occur. In addition, the system can provide periodic analytical reports that help improve security policies and identify areas most vulnerable to crime. Achieving security and stability in Syria depends on the combined efforts of society, government, and pioneering technological initiatives. Through joint work between all parties, the smart crime detection and prevention system can achieve tangible results and enhance the ability of Syrian society to confront security challenges and achieve safety and prosperity for all. Hope and optimism for a better future should be the main motivation behind adopting such smart solutions, as they can contribute to rebuilding a Syrian society that lives in peace and harmony, capable of overcoming challenges and difficulties and building a prosperous future for future generations.\tTech & Innovation\t3.1.

Traditional teaching methods fail to cater to individual learning styles, making students lose interest or confidence in STEM subjects.   Additionally, students who need personalized attention often do not receive it due to large class sizes and limited teacher availability.  As a math and physics tutor, I observed that students have different ways of absorbing information—some learn best through visual aids, others through real-world applications or interactive problem-solving. Yet, traditional education doesn’t adapt to these differences, causing frustration, disengagement, and poor retention.\tI am launching Towers, an offline educational center that integrates AI-powered support to:  Personalize tutoring based on each student’s unique learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or logical). Implement an AI assistant to provide real-time guidance and ensure students receive instant, tailored support during lessons. Deliver accurate performance feedback  so students can track their strengths and weaknesses with precise recommendations for improvement. Enhance student engagement and retention through adaptive learning techniques, ensuring that students not only understand but also enjoy math and physics.\tYes\tRural  entrepreneurs -2024  \tOther Social Media \tNA\tApplied to ACSI4\tACSI4\tdara@bloom.pm\tNo\t6\t7\t3\t1 person team\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants\nGABRIEL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION in ACSI4\tRAMZIA EL ANNAN\tramziaelannan@yahoo.com\tGABRIEL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION\tAt the moment, I am personally motivated by the opportunity to grow, learn, and make a meaningful impact through my work.

Many families struggle to find comprehensive, multidisciplinary treatment options that address both physical and cognitive health. Traditional therapies often lack a holistic approach, leaving children without the full range of care needed for their well-being. The need for pain management, rehabilitation, and regenerative medicine has also been increasing. We identified this issue through extensive research, direct engagement with affected families, and consultations with medical professionals who highlighted the lack of integrated solutions.\tOur startup, The Holistic and Regenerative Wellness Center, is a one-of-a-kind facility designed to provide comprehensive, multidisciplinary care for children with complex health challenges.   Key Offerings: Holistic Medicine: Integrating traditional treatments with alternative therapies such as stem cell therapy, ozone therapy, and electromagnetic (RIFE) therapy to support immune function and manage conditions like cancer and autism. Rehabilitation Services: Physical, occupational, and cognitive therapy programs that aid in motor and neurological development for conditions like ADHD and cerebral palsy. Pain and Wellness Therapies: Innovative solutions including cryotherapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for pain management and mental health conditions. Educational Programs: Cognitive development programs and speech therapy to promote social inclusion. Community Engagement: Workshops and events that educate families and healthcare professionals about emerging therapeutic approaches. By integrating state-of-the-art technology, cutting-edge regenerative medicine, and a patient-centric model, the center ensures a well-rounded, holistic approach to pediatric healthcare.\tYes\tAmerican University of Beirut, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Diploma\tPartner Organization \tWe believe this program will provide invaluable mentorship, networking, and resources to help us scale our initiative and enhance our impact.

I have witnessed firsthand the challenges waste collectors and manufacturers face in the plastic recycling value chain. Professionally, I am driven by the opportunity to leverage digital solutions to create economic opportunities for waste collectors while reducing plastic pollution. Personally, my passion for environmental conservation and social equity fuels my commitment to making coastal communities cleaner and more sustainable. The chance to bring innovation to this space excites me, as I believe technology can bridge existing gaps and create an inclusive, transparent, and profitable recycling ecosystem.\tAs a Co-Founder of Coastal Clean Up, my main role is leading strategic development, partnerships, and operational execution. I focus on ensuring that our model is both impactful and scalable by integrating innovative approaches to plastic waste management. My strengths lie in program management, business development, and stakeholder engagement. I bring experience in designing and implementing sustainability initiatives, leveraging technology for social impact, and building strategic collaborations with manufacturers, waste collectors, and policymakers. Also, my background in gender empowerment ensures inclusivity in our approach, creating opportunities for underserved communities, particularly women in waste collection and recycling. \tN/A\tFemale\t25-29\tKenya\tKenya\t254722778160\t2024-07-08\tKenya\tYes\tRenewables & Environment\tSDG GOAL 5: Gender Equality:::SDG GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:::SDG GOAL 14: Life Below Water:::SDG GOAL 13: Climate Action:::SDG GOAL 12: Responsible Consumption and Production\tThrough Coastal Clean Up, we aspire to create a measurable environmental, social, and economic impact aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—particularly SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water).

Many waste collectors lack direct access to buyers, resulting in low earnings, inefficiencies in recycling, and a disconnect between waste sources and manufacturers. During our involvement in coastal clean-up initiatives, we observed massive plastic accumulation along shorelines and waterways. Conversations with local waste pickers and community members revealed key challenges: Limited market access: Collectors struggle to find consistent buyers, often relying on middlemen who offer low prices. Lack of fair compensation: Manual collection is labor-intensive, yet collectors earn little due to pricing inefficiencies. Inefficient recycling systems: Manufacturers face difficulties sourcing high-quality, sorted recyclables. This gap between waste collection and recycling markets led us to develop a tech-enabled solution—a digital waste marketplace that connects collectors directly to buyers, ensuring fair pay, efficient transactions, and increased plastic recycling rates.\tOur startup, Coastal Clean Up, is a tech-driven circular economy venture that focuses on tackling plastic pollution in coastal regions. We empower waste collectors by providing direct access to buyers (manufacturers & recyclers) through a digital waste marketplace. Solution: We have developed a mobile app that enables: Digital Waste Tracking – Waste collectors can log their plastic collections, receive digital receipts, and track earnings. Instant Payments – Secure mobile money transactions ensure real-time payouts for waste collected. Marketplace Feature – Connects waste collectors directly with manufacturers and recyclers, eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair prices. Impact: By streamlining plastic collection, tracking, and sales, our solution promotes fair wages, waste reduction, and increased recycling rates, driving a sustainable, scalable, and inclusive circular economy model.\tNo\tThis is the first this year\tBloom Social Media \tLooking forward to this opportunity\tApplied to ACSI4\tACSI4\tdara@bloom.pm\tNo\t#ERROR!\t\t\tKenya\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants\nGudtolli in ACSI4\tLeila khalife\tgudtollilb@gmail.com\tGudtolli\tEmpowering Women: One of the most fulfilling aspects of my role at Gudtolli Lebanese Fresh Pasta is seeing the direct impact we have on women's lives.

Traditional marketplaces favor larger businesses, and MSMEs often lack the resources, digital tools, and logistics support to scale their businesses online. As a result, they remain dependent on local markets with limited sales opportunities, reducing their economic growth potential. How we identified it: Through extensive research, interviews with local artisans and small business owners, and direct market experience, we identified that many MSMEs face common challenges: high barriers to entry in e-commerce, lack of financial literacy, and limited access to payment and logistics solutions. Women entrepreneurs, in particular, struggle with digital visibility, making it difficult for them to compete in online marketplaces. This gap in market access and digital inclusion inspired the creation of Scout.\tScout is a digital marketplace designed to empower MSMEs—especially women-led businesses—by providing them with a seamless, accessible, and growth-oriented e-commerce platform. Our solution tackles the challenges of market access, financial inclusion, and digital transformation by offering: - A Tailored E-Commerce Platform: Scout provides an easy-to-use online marketplace where MSMEs can showcase and sell their products without the technical and financial barriers of setting up independent e-commerce stores. - Integrated Financial & Payment Solutions: We facilitate digital payments, ensuring businesses that previously relied on cash-based transactions can securely and efficiently receive payments online. - Logistics & Fulfillment Support: We partner with logistics providers to simplify shipping, making it easier for sellers to reach customers beyond their local markets. - Business Growth Tools & Training: We offer digital literacy training, marketing support, and analytics tools to help sellers optimize their sales and grow sustainably. - A Focus on Sustainable & Handmade Products: Our marketplace prioritizes ethically sourced, handmade, and eco-friendly products, aligning with sustainability goals while preserving cultural heritage.

They noticed that many homes and farms in rural areas had water leaks and contamination problems, and they spent a lot of money trying to find the leaks and/or contamination and solve them. However, this offline approach failed because there were no smart online solution systems available to quickly locate leaks, define the type of contamination, and alert users to any unusual usage.   Moreover, the same thing happened when they were staying at different buildings and hotels in urban areas in the Middle East and Africa for events and learned there was a problem with water leaks; those hotels forced them to move to another floor because they needed to perform urgent maintenance due to the damage caused by the leaks; it was noisy, and they were very unhappy about it. Also, there was a significant water loss that increased the cost of the bill. These challenges inspired us to develop long-lasting technologies.\tFounders: 1.

Professionally, I am passionate about using technology and innovation to make house-based services more accessible and efficient. Having faced these challenges myself, I understand how important it is for families to find the support they need without unnecessary obstacles. This drives me to create solutions that truly make a difference.  On a personal level, my biggest motivation comes from my two boys.

My job is to make sure that our platform works well for both families and workers \"Heroes\" by turning real-world housework challenges into practical tech solutions.  One of my biggest strengths is adaptability. I started my career in healthcare, providing direct patient care and helping families manage their needs. Over time, I saw how technology could make house-based services easier and more efficient, so I took the initiative to learn about product development. Even though I don’t have a technical background, I worked closely with developers to understand how features are built, how data is stored, and how to improve user experience. Now, I lead efforts in writing user stories, designing features, and testing the platform to make sure it meets the needs of users.  Another strength I bring is getting things done. I make sure our team is focused on the right priorities, breaking down big challenges into clear, actionable steps. By managing tasks, setting goals, and solving problems along the way, I help keep the project moving forward.  I also value teamwork and leadership. I believe in creating a work environment where everyone feels supported and motivated to do their best.

By providing access to safe and dignified work, we help vulnerable populations secure a stable income to meet their basic needs and improve their quality of life.  Goal 5: Gender equality Home Heroes empowers female house-based workers and creates a fair balance in the worker-client relationship. Working in house-based services can often leave females feeling vulnerable, which increases the risk of exploitation, abuse, or harassment. To address this, we ensure detailed job descriptions, setting clear boundaries and preventing potential misuse or unfair treatment.

The project prioritizes creating dignified and healthy working conditions for Lebanese and refugees with little to no professional skills, empowering them to earn a livelihood in a respectful and supportive environment.  In Lebanon, families have long struggled to find reliable workers for house-based services. For decades, many turned to immigrant workers for full-time assistance or hired freelancers after intensive reference checks. However, the economic crisis of 2020, followed by subsequent hardships, including a recent war, has drastically reshaped this market. Many foreign workers have left the country, and unemployment among the local workforce has skyrocketed. Poor Lebanese families and refugees, especially those with no professional skills, are struggling to survive and are at high risk of being exploited or mistreated.\tHome Heroes lb tackles the problem by matching families in need of house-based services with workers seeking jobs. Our innovative platform will use AI algorithms to connect unskilled Lebanese citizens and refugees with families, creating job opportunities for those who would otherwise struggle to find employment.  We will ensure that workers, referred to as \"Heroes,\" are placed in fair and respectful working environments, protecting their dignity and providing them with the financial stability they need to support their families. By promoting the value of house-based services, the project also works to change societal perceptions and remove the stigma around this type of work.  For families, Home Heroes lb provides a reliable and affordable solution for their household needs. This not only alleviates the difficulty of finding trusted help but also ensures that the services are accessible to low- and middle-income households.  Through this approach, our innovation reduces unemployment, provides safe and fair working opportunities, and builds a stronger, more supportive community by fostering trust and collaboration between families and workers.\tYes\tForsa III incubation program (a collaboration between Mercy Corps and Nucleus Ventures) - 2024\tBloom Alumni\tAlthough Find A Nurse has participated in several accelerators and received multiple grants, our innovative project \"Home Heroes lb\" has been turned down multiple times for the last few years.

In addition, excessive consumption of natural resources exacerbates the environmental impact, as huge quantities of products that are still usable are disposed of, increasing waste and consuming additional resources in new production processes.  How did we identify the problem? These problems were identified through extensive market research and qualitative studies with target groups, where the data showed that there is an urgent need for a platform that brings together consumers and merchants in a sustainable way, and provides an economical and low-cost alternative to buying and selling used products. Direct interaction with users, especially low-income groups and refugees, has also revealed the obstacles they face in accessing economic opportunities through e-commerce.\tCaprs  is an innovative e-commerce platform that specializes in selling used, stock, semi-new, and reproduced products, giving individuals and merchants the opportunity to recycle products and generate additional income in a sustainable way. Launched in 2022 in Jordan, the platform is the first of its kind in the region to integrate a circular economy and digital commerce, contributing to reducing product waste and supporting responsible consumption. Caprice provides a reliable marketplace that connects sellers and buyers in a safe and easy-to-use way. We address the challenges of traditional and digital trade by enabling individuals and merchants to easily sell their unused inventory through a digital platform, helping them generate additional income and reduce waste, providing economic alternatives to consumers by making products of high quality available at low prices compared to new products, reducing environmental impact by promoting a culture of reuse and reducing waste from unused products, and supporting economically vulnerable groups, such as refugees and low-income individuals, by providing sustainable income opportunities through trade. electronic.

Quality Education (SDG 4):  Objective: Provide equitable access to quality education for underserved communities. During the past 4 years we were able to serve +11000 marginalized children; either in underserved areas or special needs children with mental disability. We are planning to enroll at least 10,000 learners from marginalized backgrounds within the next two years. We have equipped 85 educational organizations with knowledge and tools for better inclusion and communication of these children. We are planning to double the number of these rehabilitation centers and organizations within the next two years. We were nominated several times for our impact and looking forward to magnify our impact and reach.  Upon analyzing the data we collect regularly from the rehabilitation centers and other educational organization we have improve student learning outcomes by at least 30% based on pre- and post-intervention assessments.  Train and give knowledge to +4000 educators, mothers and university graduates from related specialties in modern, inclusive teaching methods to foster lifelong learning opportunities within the next two years as we have reached more than 3200 of these  care givers during our past years.  2. Reduced Inequality (SDG 10):  Objective: Bridge educational and economic disparities for marginalized communities. We worked hard to reach our achievement  of 20-25% increase in access to educational resources for low-income and households and marginalized communities and we are working to double our target beneficiaries within three years.  Equipping +1200 mothers with the needed knowledge to how to better foster an autistic child through tens of awareness workshops all around the country and we are planning to triple this number within the next two years specially we have new partners like the municipalities and NGOs working with autism and special needs community.  https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1D9BchDjsz/   3. Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17):  Objective: Foster strategic partnerships to scale our impact and share resources.  Metrics:  Establish collaborations with at least +25 organizations (NGOs, educational institutions, and government bodies) within the next year. We are already in partnership with 85 educational organization across the country, more than 15 NGOs working on developing educational programs for children in general and for special needs, 3 municipalities and 2 universities with more than 8 branches to give their students and the graduates the needed skill for educational labor market.

By bridging gaps in traditional curricula, D4C ensures that participants gain expertise in inclusive and sustainable urban development, enabling them to tackle real-world challenges and design innovative public spaces. This initiative directly supports SDG 4: Quality Education, fostering lifelong learning and professional development opportunities.  D4C also actively contributes to SDG 8: Decent Work & Economic Growth by creating employment opportunities for young professionals, particularly architects and designers affected by the war in Lebanon. These professionals apply their skills in humanitarian organizations, architectural firms, or within D4C itself, focusing on sustainable, low-tech, and community-driven solutions. By strengthening economic resilience and workforce readiness, D4C ensures that participants can contribute meaningfully to their affected communities while advancing their careers.  Aligned with SDG 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities, D4C implements at least four inclusive public space projects annually, prioritizing accessibility for people with disabilities, elderly individuals, single mothers, and marginalized groups. Each project is developed through participatory design sessions, ensuring that community voices are heard in the planning and implementation of urban spaces. To further institutionalize this approach, D4C conducts awareness sessions for municipal staff, volunteers, and designers, advocating for community engagement in urban development projects.  Additionally, D4C enhances social and economic resilience through income-generating initiatives at the Nafas Community Center, such as a community kitchen that prepares 100+ meals per month for corporate clients and events. This initiative sustains the center’s operations while supporting women from the local community through employment.  Recognizing the importance of disaster preparedness, D4C also strengthens emergency response efforts by developing and piloting collective shelter models, benefiting 500+ displaced individuals annually. During the September 2024 war, D4C successfully raised $37,000 through crowdfunding, enabling the development of essential shelter guidelines for two schools.  By embedding participatory design, economic empowerment, and social impact into its core mission, D4C remains committed to creating resilient, inclusive, and sustainable communities, both in Lebanon and beyond.\tEducation & life long learning:::Active citizenship & civic engagement:::Tech & Innovation\t3.1.

Many graduates struggle to find opportunities in a saturated job market, leading to a talent drain as they seek work abroad. Additionally, limited experience in community-based design—a cornerstone of sustainable development—hampers the creation of inclusive public spaces that prioritize social well-being and environmental sustainability. As a result of the war, reconstruction is imminent in Lebanon. However, unplanned construction neglects community needs, exacerbating environmental degradation and social issues due to inadequate infrastructure. With minimal state support, restricted market size, and a lack of communal projects, opportunities for young architects remain limited. Without targeted interventions to expand the market, promote local initiatives, and integrate community-centered  design into professional training, Lebanon risks losing its skilled professionals while urban planning and social cohesion issues persist.\tD4C provides capacity building and job opportunities to designers and architects through creating sustainable, innovative and tailored solutions responding to community needs and fostering sustainable social impact.   D4C bridges the gap between design education and professional practice by empowering young professionals in community-centered design. It provides knowledge, methodology, and hands-on experience through interactive workshops, coaching and mentoring. Through the design and implementation of real-life projects which respond to the needs of local communities, architects and designers develop low-tech, socially conscious solutions that enhance the well-being of vulnerable households using a participatory approach. D4C aligns with humanitarian needs and SDGs, addressing Quality Education (SDG4), Decent Work and economic growth (SDG8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG10) and Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11) .

Many artisans, especially women, lack access to fair wages, sustainable income, and global reach for their handmade products. Additionally, the rise of mass production has threatened traditional crafts, leading to a decline in cultural heritage preservation.  How We Identified the Problem While working closely with artisans in my community, I noticed that many skilled women were unable to earn a living despite their craftsmanship. They faced multiple challenges, including:  Lack of access to markets beyond their local areas. Unfair compensation due to middlemen undervaluing their work. Limited business and digital skills to promote and sell their handmade products. Social and economic barriers preventing financial independence. Recognizing this gap, Nahfeh Studios was born—to empower artisans, provide them with fair wages, and connect them to the global market, all while preserving and celebrating traditional crafts.\tOur Startup: Nahfeh Studios  Nahfeh Studios is an impact-driven startup dedicated to preserving traditional craftsmanship while empowering artisans—especially women and displaced communities—in the Middle East. We specialize in handmade crochet products that blend cultural heritage with contemporary design. By uniting skilled artisans through initiatives like the “1 Square Initiative,” we create unique, high-quality items that resonate with global consumers while providing a sustainable source of income for our craft communities.  Our Solution  Our solution addresses the dual challenge of economic hardship and cultural erosion.

Farmers often rely on traditional irrigation methods that waste up to 50% of water and apply fertilizers inefficiently, harming both productivity and the environment.  We first identified this issue through direct engagement with farmers in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon’s largest agricultural region. Many farmers shared concerns about water shortages, rising costs, and unpredictable weather conditions affecting their crops. Through field visits and discussions, we observed that most irrigation systems lacked automation and real-time monitoring, leading to waste and inefficiencies. Recognizing this challenge, we developed SmartLand’s climate-smart irrigation and fertigation system to provide farmers with a data-driven, automated solution that optimizes water and fertilizer use, reducing waste and improving productivity.\tSmartLand is a climate-tech startup revolutionizing agriculture in Lebanon by providing smart irrigation and fertigation solutions that optimize water and fertilizer use.

As a Namibian woman driven by the need for societal change, I am particularly inspired by programs like the Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation (ACSI4). The focus of ACSI4 on communities facing crises resonates with me personally and professionally because I understand the immense challenges these communities encounter, and I see how critical it is to foster solutions that are not only sustainable but also responsive to the trauma and hardships they have experienced.  I am fueled by the desire to create platforms that can empower and connect local voices, bringing people together to innovate, collaborate, and drive positive change. The ACSI4's emphasis on mentorship, seed funding, and trauma-informed support is especially motivating because it aligns with my passion for providing the tools that entrepreneurs need to rebuild and revitalize their communities.  I firmly believe in the power of innovation to create lasting systems change. At this stage, the ACSI4's support in helping early-stage social enterprises is an opportunity to amplify the impact of solutions in Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and the Syrian diaspora, and it inspires me to keep pushing forward with my own work to help communities thrive in times of crisis.    \tAs the lead of CILA, my main role is to oversee the strategic direction, community outreach, and operational implementation of our social innovation initiatives. I ensure that the goals of fostering communication and connection within local communities are met while maintaining the integrity of our mission. My responsibilities also include managing partnerships, securing funding, and providing guidance to entrepreneurs who are at the early stages of their ventures.  The strengths I bring to the team are my deep understanding of community dynamics and the challenges faced by underserved populations. My background in social innovation equips me to address complex problems with creative solutions, drawing on my ability to think critically and empathetically. I also have strong leadership skills, which help me effectively collaborate with diverse teams and inspire others to share in the vision. My experience in navigating both the social impact space and the challenges that come with trauma-informed work enables me to provide the necessary support to teams facing adversity. I am passionate about creating sustainable change, and my adaptability and resilience help drive the team towards success even in challenging circumstances.    \t  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalinasho-trading-enterprises-cc-she-farm-22b378244\tFemale\t35-39\tNamibia\tNamibia\t264812546850\t2024-05-02\tNamibia\tYes\tTechnology; General / Other\tSDG GOAL 5: Gender Equality:::SDG GOAL 10: Reduced Inequality:::SDG GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:::SDG GOAL 9: Industry / Innovation / Infrastructure\tThrough CILA, I aspire to create significant impact in the areas of sustainable cities (SDG 11) and reducing inequalities (SDG 10) by empowering local communities with the tools to innovate, communicate, and collaborate. By fostering local innovation hubs and providing a platform for marginalized voices, we aim to reduce the digital divide and increase access to critical information, resources, and opportunities.  Our goal is to engage at least 1,000 individuals in the first year, helping them connect with local solutions and entrepreneurs. We seek to increase community-led initiatives by 25%, directly impacting urban development in underserved areas. Additionally, through our outreach, we aim to reduce barriers to access for at least 500 entrepreneurs, helping them turn ideas into sustainable ventures that promote economic growth and social inclusion.  Ultimately, we want to enable communities to reduce dependency on external support by equipping them with the skills to drive their own sustainable development. This would contribute to the broader goal of building more resilient, self-sustaining cities and reducing inequality within these communities.    \tEducation & life long learning:::Tech & Innovation\t2.2.

Many communities, especially underserved areas, struggle to connect with businesses, public services, and emergency response systems, which impacts overall safety, well-being, and access to opportunities.  I first identified this issue when observing how disconnected various sectors of communities are from one another. Residents often lack awareness of essential services such as healthcare, local businesses, or public safety measures, while businesses struggle to reach potential customers within their vicinity. Additionally, during emergencies, communication breakdowns can delay response times, heightening the risk to people’s lives and property.  CILA solves this by creating a platform where residents can communicate in real-time with others within their jurisdiction, view available services, products, and business locations, and access information on crime prevention and disaster preparedness. The platform also supports community policing efforts by enabling users to report suspicious activities and emergencies quickly. This system improves emergency response times, facilitates disaster preparedness, and helps prevent crime by fostering greater community engagement and collective responsibility, ultimately building stronger, safer, and more connected neighborhoods.    \tCILA is an innovative startup that integrates Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance the efficiency of urban management and community engagement. Our solution utilizes smart devices connected to the IoT network, optimizing local authority operations and services while improving communication between citizens and their surroundings.  CILA creates a dynamic, real-time platform where users can interact with their community via a locational feed. Every member within a designated jurisdiction can connect, communicate, and view information about services, products, and business locations within their area. This empowers city residents to easily access relevant services and resources, enhancing convenience and promoting local economic growth.  Additionally, CILA plays a crucial role in urban management by enabling authorities and citizens to respond to local issues in real time. Whether it’s a community service, a product in a shop, or information related to public safety, CILA ensures that everyone stays informed, connected, and involved. This fosters stronger, more resilient communities with optimized services and improved overall quality of life.\tNo\tN/A\tBloom Newsletter\tCILA not only improves access to essential services but also fosters a sense of community and belonging. By empowering residents to interact, share information, and stay informed in real-time, we create an environment where people are actively engaged in their neighborhoods, strengthening social cohesion.  Our solution also supports sustainable urban growth by promoting local businesses and services, allowing them to reach a wider audience without the barriers of traditional marketing or infrastructure limitations. This, in turn, boosts local economies and creates jobs.  Through the integration of IoT and ICT, CILA is future-proofing communities by enabling smart city solutions that can evolve with emerging technologies. This scalable platform can adapt to any urban or rural setting, offering endless possibilities for enhancing city living, improving public safety, and streamlining local governance.  Ultimately, CILA aims to transform cities into smarter, more connected ecosystems that foster collaboration, reduce inequalities, and improve the quality of life for all residents.    \tApplied to ACSI4\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tNo\t#ERROR!\t\t\tShe Farm is based in Namibia\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants\nReef - ريف in ACSI4\tAbdallah Alkhawaldeh\tabdallahbassam9@gmail.com\tReef - ريف\tRight now, what’s driving me personally is my passion for connecting people to the land and nature, and finding real, sustainable solutions for rural and marginalized communities.

Professionally, I’m motivated by my desire to develop environmental and agricultural projects that serve as models for sustainable local production and create job opportunities for youth and refugees. I’m also deeply driven to raise environmental awareness — whether through the content I create or the projects I work on — because I truly believe that every small step makes a difference and brings us closer to a cleaner, more sustainable future.  I keep pushing forward because I see hope in young minds and in every seed we plant as a promise of a better life and a thriving community.\tMy main role in the team is to lead and guide our vision for sustainable agriculture, environmental innovation, and community empowerment.

For example, implementing rainwater harvesting systems and renewable energy can reduce emissions and enhance water security in rural areas. \t•\tSDG 2: Zero Hunger — By supporting small-scale farmers, refugees, and vulnerable communities with training and resources to produce their own food sustainably, I aim to enhance food security. My goal is to help at least 50 families establish their own productive farms within two years. \t•\tSDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities — Through educational agro-tourism experiences and community-led agricultural initiatives, I hope to foster stronger ties between people and nature, creating more sustainable, self-sufficient communities. I aspire to host 1,000 students annually in farm-based learning experiences. \t•\tSDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth — By creating local agricultural businesses and connecting them to markets, I want to generate income opportunities for rural youth and refugees. The goal is to create at least 20 job opportunities within the first year of the project. \t•\tSDG 15: Life on Land — By restoring soil health through regenerative agriculture and promoting biodiversity, I aim to protect and restore ecosystems. The target is to convert at least 10 hectares of land to sustainable farming practices in the first three years.  Impact Aspiration: I aspire to build a resilient agricultural ecosystem that not only addresses climate change but also empowers communities to thrive independently. By combining sustainable production, environmental education, and community-driven innovation, my goal is to create a replicable model that can be scaled across rural areas, transforming both lives and landscapes \tActive citizenship & civic engagement\t1.1. Want to start and looking for/testing ideas\t3\tNo\tNo sales yet\tNo\tNo\tN\\A\tN\\A\tThe Problem: In rural areas, especially in underserved communities like my hometown Maras’a, people struggle with food insecurity, unemployment, and the worsening impacts of climate change. Farmers face depleted soil, water scarcity, and rising costs of production, making it difficult to sustain their livelihoods. Youth and refugees often have limited access to decent work opportunities, and there’s a growing disconnect between people and nature, especially among younger generations.  How I Identified It: I grew up in a rural village, witnessing firsthand how climate change and economic hardship affected my community. Through my work with refugee farmers and rural populations, I saw how a lack of resources, knowledge, and market access trapped people in cycles of poverty and environmental degradation. Conversations with farmers, parents, and local youth highlighted their need for sustainable, local solutions — from learning about climate-smart practices to finding reliable ways to generate income.  This direct connection to the land and community, combined with my work as an agricultural engineer and climate activist, made the problem impossible to ignore. I realized that by blending sustainable farming, environmental education, and community-driven innovation, we could address multiple challenges at once — creating solutions that help people, nature, and the local economy thrive together.\tMy Startup: I’m building a sustainable agricultural and eco-tourism initiative that empowers rural communities, refugees, and youth through climate-smart farming, nature-based solutions, and hands-on environmental education. The project combines regenerative agriculture, local food production, and immersive farm experiences to create a sustainable, community-driven ecosystem.  The Solution: Our initiative revolves around three core pillars: \t1.\tSustainable Agriculture & Food Security: We train local farmers, youth, and refugees in sustainable and climate-smart practices, like rainwater harvesting, composting, and crop diversification. We provide them with the tools, resources, and ongoing mentorship needed to establish their own small farms or improve existing ones — creating reliable, local food sources and enhancing livelihoods. \t2.\tEco-Tourism & Education: We offer experiential farm visits for schools and families, where participants can engage in hands-on agricultural activities, learn about sustainability, and build a deeper connection to nature. These visits generate income for the farm, while teaching the next generation about the importance of environmental stewardship. \t3.\tMarket Access & Community Resilience: We help farmers package and market their produce as premium, locally-grown products, connecting them to conscious consumers. The platform we’re building will link farms with schools, institutions, and individuals seeking educational experiences or high-quality food, fostering local economic growth.  The Impact: \t•\tImprove food security for at least 50 families within 2 years \t•\tCreate 20+ sustainable job opportunities in rural areas within the first year \t•\tConvert 10 hectares of land to sustainable farming practices within 3 years \t•\tHost 1,000+ students annually for farm-based educational experiences  This holistic approach addresses environmental, economic, and social challenges all at once — building a resilient future where communities can thrive alongside nature \tNo\tN\\A\tWord of Mouth\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tNo\t#ERROR!\t\t\tReef - ريف is at Stage 1.1 (Want to start and looking for/testing ideas), which is earlier than ACSI4’s minimum of Stage 2.2. \tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants\nLoghati in ACSI4\thanin jawhari\thanin.jawhari@gmail.com\tLoghati\tWhat's motivating me is the results I am seeing with my work and it's impact on helping  people and changing their lives.

Our unique approach, combining a coffee shop with training courses and a dedicated training room, delivers value not only through the coffee itself but more importantly in the opportunities it offers for personal and professional growth. The impact we aim to achieve aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically: 1. **SDG 4 – Quality Education:** By offering hands-on workshops, training courses, and a collaborative learning space, we create an inclusive educational environment for individuals seeking to build their skills. We aim to train at least **200 individuals per year**, providing them with professional development opportunities that directly improve their employment prospects and entrepreneurship abilities. 2. **SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth:** Through our focus on fostering entrepreneurship and skill development, we aim to have **20+ new businesses** launched annually by individuals who have completed our courses. Additionally, we are committed to providing employment to **50+ individuals**, including local baristas and instructors, creating a sustainable economic model within the community. 3. **SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production:** We are advocates for healthy living, primarily through the promotion of **organic and sustainable food options** in our coffee shop. We aim to source and introduce at least **75% of our food ingredients** from sustainable, local sources, adhering to ethical production practices. In essence, our impact is multi-dimensional: We’re not only serving coffee but nurturing a space for learning, growing, and creating new opportunities. Our goal is to make the Academy Coffee Space a vibrant hub for education, sustainable business practices, and community growth, all while contributing toward the broader global sustainability goals  Our concept is designed to be a catalyst for positive social change by integrating healthy living with quality education and economic empowerment. As the first coffee shop in the region to feature dedicated training courses and a fully-equipped training room, our goal is to achieve measurable impacts aligned with key SDGs:  SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being): We aim to serve healthy food options daily, targeting at least 100 nutritious meals per day that promote well-being and reduce reliance on less healthy alternatives.  SDG 4 (Quality Education): Through our training courses, we plan to host a minimum of 10 courses per month in our training room. This initiative is projected to reach over 1,200 participants annually, equipping them with vital skills in hospitality, healthy living, and entrepreneurship.  SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): By managing and expanding our operations, we anticipate creating 15–20 local job opportunities, from baristas to administrative roles, and fostering a culture of continuous professional development.  In summary, our coffee shop not only provides a welcoming space for healthy eating but also serves as a community hub for learning and empowerment. This integrated approach is designed to drive both immediate and long-term socioeconomic improvements, making a tangible difference in our community.\tEducation & life long learning:::Entrepreneurship:::Tech & Innovation\t\"4.1. Declining revenues, and the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\"\t6\tYes\tStagnant\tNo\tNo\thttps://www.instagram.com/academy.coffeespace/\thttps://drive.google.com/file/d/12zQ3NciKreOD2vozvE88qQuI_g4JbJxS/view?usp=sharing\tOur primary problem is the lack of accessible and healthy food options, coupled with a gap in affordable, quality educational resources for local communities. Additionally, local job opportunities in the hospitality and wellness sectors remain underdeveloped in the region. I first identified this issue through firsthand experience while interacting with the community. Many people expressed frustration with the limited availability of healthy food options in local coffee outlets, often resulting in unhealthy choices that affect their well-being. Furthermore, I noticed that there was a lack of accessible educational spaces that provided practical skills for employment—particularly associated with sustainability and wellness practices. I realized that our community needed a place that both nurtured health-conscious eating habits and provided accessible training for various skills that could empower individuals economically. Combining these elements into one innovative concept— a coffee shop with an integrated training facility—felt like the right solution to address these pressing needs  The core problem we're addressing is the absence of a community space that simultaneously promotes healthy living and provides accessible education and professional development opportunities. In our region, most coffee shops focus solely on serving beverages and snacks, often lacking nutritious food options and a venue for learning. This gap means that many community members miss out on opportunities to enhance their skills, particularly in areas like hospitality, healthy lifestyle practices, and entrepreneurship.  I first identified this issue while closely following courses and events at the academy. Through interactions with community members and feedback from local participants, it became clear that there was a strong demand for a space where people could not only enjoy a healthy meal but also learn and grow professionally. This insight inspired our concept—the first coffee shop equipped with dedicated training courses and a fully functional training room. By integrating these elements, we aim to create a hub that nurtures both physical well-being and personal development, addressing critical needs in our community.\tShare   You said: ماذا نسمي الجمهور الذي يكون يحضر البرامج في الاستديو باللغة الإنكليزية؟  ChatGPT said: الجمهور الذي يحضر البرامج في الاستوديو يُطلق عليه باللغة الإنجليزية \"Studio Audience\".

I have been born and raised in a rural area, and I have experienced and witnessed firsthand inside my family and in many many other families how the financially dependent women are bound by those who are in charge of their financials. \tReef provides a grassroots solution by providing those women with access to job opportunities with the skills they already have and by professionalizing those skills so that they are able to generate income. We train women on food safety, culinary arts and basic business and computer skills so that they can turn their kitchens into income-generating stations. This solution offers women coming from remote and very conservative societies who are unable to access income-generating opportunities the chance for financial freedom that is directly linked to their personal freedom. \tYes\tREAF program by Berytech \tBloom Social Media \tNA\tApplied to ACSI4\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tNo\t#ERROR!\t\t\tReef is at Stage 4.2 (Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but not yet profitable/sustainable)\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants\nAhla Fawda in ACSI4\tZiad Daouk\tahlafawda@gmail.com\tAhla Fawda\tI am personally and professionally motivated by the opportunity to create sustainable, community-driven impact through design, operations, and environmental initiatives.

Ahla Fawda has been at the forefront of emergency response, sustainable development, and social impact initiatives, leveraging its EcoHub as a center for recycling, upcycling, education, and green entrepreneurship. The EcoHub currently processes over 2 tons of waste per month, runs educational programs on sustainability, and empowers marginalized communities through skills training and income-generating activities. Looking ahead, we plan to expand our EcoHub facilities and programs, increasing our impact on waste reduction, job creation, and circular economy solutions while strengthening partnerships that drive sustainable change.  Our work directly contributes to several Sustainable Development Goals. Under SDG 1: No Poverty, we focus on creating income-generating opportunities for vulnerable communities, particularly among women, youth, and displaced individuals, by integrating them into sustainable economic activities. By embedding financial inclusion into our initiatives, we help build long-term resilience and reduce dependency on aid. Addressing SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, we are expanding economic opportunities for at least 30 individuals through the EcoHub’s recycling, upcycling, and sustainable production initiatives. Our expansion plans will create additional green jobs in waste collection, sorting, and processing while enhancing employability through training programs such as 360 Green Vision, which equips participants with sustainable business skills, eco-design expertise, and waste management knowledge. More than 50 people per year will receive hands-on training in circular economy practices, empowering them to become active contributors to Lebanon’s emerging green economy.  In alignment with SDG 10: Reduced Inequality, Ahla Fawda is committed to fostering an inclusive environment where marginalized groups, including displaced individuals and low-income families, can participate in and benefit from sustainable economic models. The EcoHub is designed as an accessible space that ensures equal opportunities, providing a platform for skill development and financial independence. Under SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, the EcoHub functions as more than a sustainability center—it is a community space that fosters inclusive governance, transparency, and social cohesion. By actively engaging local and displaced communities in collaborative environmental projects, we strengthen social ties and build shared ownership over sustainability efforts. Each year, we facilitate at least five new community-led initiatives focused on environmental sustainability, skill-sharing programs, and inclusive decision-making, ensuring that our work extends beyond waste reduction to promote social resilience.  Under SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, the EcoHub currently processes over 2 tons of waste per month, repurposing plastic, glass, fabric, and other materials into upcycled products such as eco-friendly bags, furniture, and home accessories. As part of our expansion plans, we aim to scale up recycling and upcycling capacity by increasing collection points and processing facilities. By developing additional product lines and promoting eco-conscious consumer habits, we encourage individuals and businesses to recognize the economic value of repurposed materials. A key aspect of our work is shifting consumer mindsets by promoting sustainable consumption through community education and awareness campaigns.  Our expansion also strengthens SDG 13: Climate Action by increasing our waste management capacity and promoting zero-waste principles across all operations. We aim to scale up recycling and waste diversion efforts, targeting a 50 percent increase in waste processing capacity while reducing reliance on single-use plastics. By integrating zero-waste principles into our production processes and educational initiatives, we empower communities to adopt sustainable lifestyles and actively contribute to climate action.  Finally, our approach is grounded in SDG 17: Partnerships to Achieve Goals, as we recognize that meaningful change requires collaboration. Ahla Fawda actively builds partnerships with local businesses, municipalities, non-profits, and international organizations to amplify impact. By working alongside diverse stakeholders, we create synergies that drive sustainable development and ensure that our solutions are scalable and adaptable to different contexts.  Beyond these quantifiable outcomes, Ahla Fawda’s EcoHub provides a replicable model for community-driven sustainability, strengthens collaboration between diverse groups, and enhances local resilience in the face of economic, social, and environmental challenges. By scaling our operations and deepening our impact, we aim to expand the reach of circular economy solutions, proving that sustainable development can drive both social transformation and economic growth.\tActive citizenship & civic engagement:::Entrepreneurship:::Education & life long learning:::Good governance:::Tech & Innovation\t\"4.2.

The country faces a severe waste crisis, with limited recycling infrastructure and excessive landfill reliance, leading to environmental degradation. At the same time, economic instability and displacement have left many individuals—particularly women, youth, and marginalized groups—without access to stable income opportunities. Additionally, social cohesion has been weakened by ongoing economic and political crises, creating divisions between host and displaced communities.  We first identified these challenges through our direct engagement with communities. As a grassroots organization, we worked closely with neighborhoods affected by Lebanon’s economic collapse and environmental decline. Through our humanitarian relief work, we saw firsthand how food insecurity, unemployment, and waste mismanagement were interlinked. Communities lacked sustainable solutions for economic empowerment and environmental sustainability. This realization led us to develop the EcoHub, a circular economy model that integrates waste management, upcycling, and income-generating activities to provide long-term, community-led solutions.  By transforming waste into economic opportunities, promoting green jobs, and fostering social cohesion through collaborative environmental initiatives, Ahla Fawda is tackling these urgent challenges at their root while empowering local communities to take ownership of sustainable solutions.\tAhla Fawda is a grassroots non-profit organization that has evolved into a community-driven social enterprise, addressing waste mismanagement, unemployment, and social fragmentation in Lebanon through sustainable, circular economy solutions. Our flagship initiative, the EcoHub, is an innovative sustainability hub that integrates recycling, upcycling, and green entrepreneurship to create economic opportunities while reducing environmental impact.  The EcoHub tackles Lebanon’s severe waste crisis by processing over 2 tons of waste per month, transforming discarded plastic, glass, metal, and fabric into marketable upcycled products such as eco-friendly furniture, bags, home accessories, and fashion items. By expanding community awareness and providing educational programs on waste reduction and sustainable consumption, we aim to shift mindsets and promote a culture of environmental responsibility.  Beyond its environmental impact, the EcoHub is an engine for economic empowerment, providing income-generating opportunities for at least 30 individuals, particularly women, youth, and displaced people. Through its expansion, the initiative is increasing green job creation in waste collection, sorting, and processing, while also offering training programs such as 360 Green Vision, which equips participants with eco-business skills and employability in the green economy. By linking sustainability with economic opportunity, we ensure that environmental solutions directly benefit vulnerable communities.  The EcoHub is also a community-building space, fostering social cohesion and inclusive governance by engaging local and displaced communities in collaborative environmental projects. It brings together volunteers, artisans, and businesses to co-create solutions that enhance both sustainability and social stability. By prioritizing transparency, grassroots leadership, and community participation, Ahla Fawda ensures that its impact extends beyond waste reduction, helping to rebuild social trust and economic resilience.

Our goal is to promote healthier beauty choices by offering 100% natural, handmade, and clean products, free from harmful chemicals. By 2026, we aim to convert at least **5,000** customers to clean beauty alternatives, reducing exposure to toxic ingredients and encouraging wellness-focused routines.    In terms of sustainability, we are committed to minimizing our environmental footprint. Our use of biodegradable accessories, such as bio loofahs and scalp massagers, supports waste reduction efforts.

Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but the enterprise is not however profitable/sustainable\"\t4\tYes\tStagnant\tYes\tNo\twww.soglam.online\tNA\tSoGlam was born out of a clear gap in the beauty market—especially in Lebanon—for natural, clean, and affordable beauty products. I noticed that many local options were either filled with harmful chemicals or high-quality alternatives were overpriced and inaccessible to the average consumer.  The turning point for me was my personal struggle to find skincare and haircare products that were both safe and effective. I became increasingly aware of how many mainstream products contained toxic ingredients that could harm long-term health. At the same time, I noticed a growing demand among women around me—friends, family, and even strangers—seeking cleaner, more natural alternatives but feeling frustrated by the lack of options that were both trustworthy and affordable.  SoGlam was my response to that problem: a brand offering 100% natural, handmade, and clean beauty products that are effective, accessible, and crafted with care. Beyond just skincare, it’s about promoting wellness, conscious consumption, and creating products that people can trust—especially in a market that often lacks transparency\tSoGlam is a Lebanese startup that offers a range of natural, handmade, and clean beauty products. Our product line includes natural fragrances, hair and body treatments, and accessories designed to complement these treatments—like bio loofahs and biodegradable scalp massagers. What sets SoGlam apart is our commitment to using only pure, non-toxic ingredients, ensuring that each product promotes wellness and beauty without compromising health.  The solution we offer is simple yet powerful: a shift towards safer, more conscious beauty routines. Many beauty products on the market today are filled with harmful chemicals that can affect both our health and the environment. SoGlam addresses this by providing affordable, high-quality alternatives that are eco-friendly and skin-friendly. Whether it’s a nourishing body oil or a gentle exfoliating scrub, our products are designed to bring out the best in your skin while aligning with a sustainable, clean lifestyle.  Our vision is to create a brand that not only provides effective solutions but also helps empower individuals—especially women—by offering products that support both self-care and environmental responsibility. We want SoGlam to be a symbol of resilience, especially in Lebanon, where we continue to craft beauty solutions that give back to our community and encourage positive change\tYes\tHermenow 2023\tBloom Alumni\tAt SoGlam, we’re incredibly eager to join this program as it represents a key opportunity for growth and expansion.

On a professional level, I’m really driven by the idea of building something meaningful and sustainable.

Some need extra help with their studies, others just haven’t found the right way to learn, and many don’t have the guidance they need at home. Unfortunately, a lot of existing tutoring options are either too expensive or take a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn’t really work for every student. We started this tutoring center—to provide a space where students get the individual attention, engaging activities, and structured support they need to succeed. Our goal isn’t just to help with schoolwork; it’s to build confidence, encourage curiosity, and make learning something they enjoy rather than fear. We aim that students become lifelong learners.  \tOur startup is a private tutoring center that goes beyond traditional tutoring. We provide students with personalized after-school support, helping them not only improve academically but also develop essential skills that will serve them in the long run. What makes us different is our holistic approach—we tailor our support to each student’s needs, incorporate interactive weekly activities to keep learning engaging, and involve parents through regular sessions and bimonthly progress reports.  Our solution addresses the common challenges students face, such as lack of individualized attention, ineffective study methods, and limited guidance at home. We provide a structured yet flexible learning environment where students can receive one-on-one or small group tutoring, participate in workshops across different fields, and develop confidence in their abilities.  In addition to academic subjects, we aim to empower students with skills that extend beyond the classroom, offering workshops in various fields and providing an inclusive learning space where they feel supported.

Additionally, there is a major gap in pet care education, leaving owners unaware of proper grooming routines, health concerns, and best practices to keep their pets happy and healthy.  🔹 How We First Identified It: 1️⃣ First-Hand Experience – As passionate pet lovers, we noticed a lack of premium, specialized pet grooming products that cater to different fur types, skin sensitivities, and hygiene needs. 2️⃣ Market Research & Customer Feedback – Talking to pet owners, groomers, and veterinarians revealed common concerns like irritation from harsh shampoos, ineffective flea treatments, and the struggle to maintain pet hygiene between grooming sessions. 3️⃣ Pet Industry Gaps – Many existing pet care products are either low-quality, heavily chemical-based, or expensive imports that don’t suit all pets. 4️⃣ Lack of Knowledge in Pet Care – We identified that most pet owners don’t have easy access to expert advice, which inspired us to create the Whiskers Live Channel, featuring veterinarians and celebrities to educate pet owners and bridge the knowledge gap.  With Whiskers, we are solving these issues by providing scientifically formulated, pet-safe grooming solutions, educating pet owners through Whiskers Live Channel, and setting new standards in luxury pet care.\t🔹 About Whiskers: Whiskers is a premium pet care brand dedicated to revolutionizing grooming and hygiene for dogs and cats.

      "content": "Below is a step-by-step guide, along with example charts and analyses, that you can use to present both **qualitative** and **quantitative** insights about the many applicants for your Bloom.pm social enterprise startup accelerator (ACSI4). The examples focus on some core comparisons—such as country distribution, gender, SDG focus, and venture stage—but you can adapt them to highlight additional dimensions you find relevant (e.g., sector, founding date, or other criteria). \n\n---\n\n## 1. Outline the Data Points to Highlight\n\nGiven the breadth of information each applicant provided, decide on the “layers” of data you’d like to present in charts and analyses. Typical layers include:\n\n1. **Basic Demographics**  \n   - Country (Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Palestine, or other)  \n   - Gender (Female, Male, Mixed team, etc.)  \n   - Age range (optional, if relevant or available)\n\n2. **Venture Details**  \n   - Sector or focus (e.g., Agriculture, Technology, Health, Education, etc.)  \n   - Stage of the venture (Idea stage, prototype, early revenues, or more mature)  \n   - SDG alignment (which SDGs do they target?)\n\n3. **Team & Leadership**  \n   - Female-led or not  \n   - Solo founder vs. team\n\n4. **Impact Goals**  \n   - Target beneficiaries (e.g., rural farmers, refugees, women, youth)  \n   - Impact metrics (e.g., “serve 100 farmers,” “reduce plastic by 2 tons per month,” etc.)\n\n5. **Traction & Partnerships**  \n   - Existing partnerships or previous programs  \n   - Mention of revenues or funding to date  \n\nSelecting a handful of categories from the above will allow you to create meaningful charts and short write-ups.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Convert the Applicants’ Text Into a Usable Table\n\nA quick tip is to gather a few key columns (like Applicant Name, Country, Gender, Stage, Sector, SDGs) in a spreadsheet or small table. Below is a **sample** structure (fictional data just for demonstration):\n\n| Applicant / Team            | Country   | Gender  | Stage     | Sector           | SDGs                               | Female-Led? |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|---------|----------|------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|\n| SafeSyria - Asfari (example)| Syria     | Mixed   | 3.1       | Technology       | Goal 16: Peace / Justice           | No         |\n| GoPark                      | Lebanon   | Male    | 3.1       | Tech & Innovation| Goal 11, Goal 13                   | No         |\n| Grade A Plus                | Lebanon   | Female  | 5.2       | Agriculture      | Goal 15, 9, 13, etc.               | Yes        |\n| … and so on …              | Jordan    | Female  | 2.2       | Renewables       | Goal 6, 12                         | Yes        |\n\nOnce you have that structure, you can **count** how many applicants appear in each category.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Generate Key Quantitative Insights\n\nBelow are some example metrics you might extract from the table:\n\n1. **Number of Applicants by Country**  \n   - Lebanon: X  \n   - Jordan: Y  \n   - Syria: Z  \n   - Palestine: W  \n   - Others: K  \n\n2. **Venture Stage Distribution**  \n   - Stage 1.1 (Idea/Testing): 10  \n   - Stage 2.2 (Started Developing Idea): 5  \n   - Stage 3.1 (Prototype with Early Users): 8  \n   - Stage 4.2 or 4.3 (Some Revenue but Not Yet Profitable): 12  \n   - Stage 5.1 or 5.2 (Profitable / Seeking Scalability): 6  \n\n3. **Sector Breakdown**  \n   - Agriculture: A  \n   - Education: B  \n   - Health / Well-being: C  \n   - Technology / Innovation: D  \n   - Nonprofit or Civic Engagement: E  \n   - Food & Beverage: F  \n   - Others: G  \n\n4. **SDGs Most Mentioned**  \n   - Goal 4 (Quality Education): 15  \n   - Goal 5 (Gender Equality): 20  \n   - Goal 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth): 18  \n   - Goal 13 (Climate Action): 10  \n   - … etc.  \n\n5. **Female-Led Ventures**  \n   - Yes: M  \n   - No: N  \n\nThese raw counts can feed directly into your visuals.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Create Visual Representations\n\nBelow are a few **example charts** with a short explanation of each. (All images below are ASCII placeholders—replace them with real charts you create in Excel, Google Sheets, or any analytics tool.)\n\n### A. Applicants by Country (Bar Chart)\n\n```\n|           Number of Applicants by Country\n|\n| 15  █████████████\n| 10  █████████     \n|  5  █████   \n|  0  ─────────────────────────────────\n      Lebanon   Jordan   Syria   Palestine\n```\n\n- **What it shows**: The volume of applicants from each country, quickly conveying geographical reach.\n\n### B. Venture Stage Distribution (Pie Chart)\n\n```\n          Stage Distribution\n\n              ( 1.1  ) 10%\n        ( 2.2 ) 15%\n( 3.1 ) 20%            ( 5.x ) 25%\n       ( 4.x ) 30%\n```\n\n- **What it shows**: The percentage of applicants who are at idea, prototype, early revenue, or profitability stages.\n\n### C. Sector / Theme Focus (Stacked Bar or Column Chart)\n\n```\n     Agriculture   ████ 15\n     Technology    ███████ 22\n     Education     ██████████ 30\n     Healthcare    ██ 5\n     Food & Bev.   ██ 8\n     ...\n```\n\n- **What it shows**: The distribution of top sectors or thematic focus among your applicants.\n\n### D. SDG Mentions (Horizontal Bar Chart)\n\n```\nGoal 4: Quality Education          █████████ (14)\nGoal 5: Gender Equality            █████████████ (18)\nGoal 8: Decent Work & Econ Growth  ██████████ (12)\nGoal 13: Climate Action            █████ ( 7)\nGoal 16: Peace & Justice           ████ ( 5)\n...\n```\n\n- **What it shows**: Which SDGs are most commonly addressed by your applicants.\n\n### E. Female-Led Ventures (Doughnut Chart)\n\n```\n        Female-Led Ventures\n\n     40% YES\n     60% NO\n```\n\n- **What it shows**: Proportion of ventures that have at least one female founder or are entirely female-led.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Add Qualitative Context\n\nCharts are powerful, but **storytelling** and **key takeaways** bring them to life. For instance:\n\n1. **Regional Insights**  \n   - “While Lebanon has the highest number of applicants (35%), we see a rising interest from Jordan (25%) and Syria (20%). This shift could reflect growing entrepreneurship ecosystems in these regions.”\n\n2. **SDG Analysis**  \n   - “A large portion (45%) target SDG 5 (Gender Equality), possibly reflecting the surge in women-led initiatives and the focus on women's empowerment across the region.”\n\n3. **Stage Observations**  \n   - “Interestingly, 40% of ventures remain at early prototype stage, signifying a robust pipeline of new ideas. Meanwhile, around 20% are profitable but seeking scalability, underscoring the need for follow-on funding.”\n\n4. **Sector Gaps**  \n   - “We notice fewer applicants in Healthcare and Renewable Energy, which might be an opportunity for more specialized outreach in future cycles.”\n\n5. **Notable Trends**  \n   - “Multiple Lebanese ventures mention tackling the economic crisis head-on, focusing on cost-reduction products or local agriculture solutions.”\n\n---\n\n## 6. Highlight Innovative or Unique Approaches (Qualitative)\n\nBeyond the numbers, you can share mini-profiles of a few interesting applicants:\n\n- **Grade A Plus** (Lebanon): *Upcycles sheep wool into SoilPlus, a sustainable fertilizer. Claims a 293% ROI for farmers in cost reduction and yield improvement.*  \n- **SyrConn** (Syria): *A digital freelance marketplace specialized for Syrian professionals lacking global job opportunities, aiming for 10,000 new freelancers in 3 years.*  \n- **GoPark** (Lebanon): *An “Airbnb of parking” solution that reduces traffic congestion and emissions. Focuses on optimizing underutilized parking spaces for owners.*\n\nPick out a handful of especially **impactful** or **creative** solutions and describe them in short, punchy paragraphs or bullet points. This helps your audience see the **human story** behind the data.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conclude with Macro-Level Observations\n\nWrap up your analysis by tying the data and stories together. Some sample concluding remarks:\n\n> **“Overall, the 50+ applicants reflect a vibrant ecosystem of social innovation in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Palestine. Nearly half are focusing on pressing environmental and agricultural issues, while a growing portion address challenges in education, public safety, and digital marketplaces. The majority are still pre-profit, which underscores the vital need for accelerator support, mentorship, and funding. As we move into the next stage of ACSI4, these insights guide how we’ll tailor our training, networking, and resource allocation to maximize each venture’s success.”**\n\n---\n\n## 8. Presentation Tips\n\n1. **Balance** text with visuals. Summaries of 2-3 lines under each chart let your audience interpret data quickly.\n2. **Highlight** big wins or unusual stats in bold or separate callouts.\n3. **Allow** time for Q&A and discussion so stakeholders can dive deeper into the insights that matter most.\n4. **Use real quotes** from the participants (with permission) to add authenticity to your presentation.\n5. **Emphasize your next steps**—e.g., “We’ll focus our next outreach on bridging the gap in Healthcare solutions,” or “We’ll design new programs specifically for female founders at early prototype stage.”\n\n---\n\n# Putting It All Together\n\nBy combining **quantitative charts** (country distribution, sector breakdown, SDGs) with **qualitative takeaways** (unique innovation stories, macro-level trends), you’ll give a well-rounded view of the applicant pool. This approach not only engages your audience visually but also ensures the data **tells a story**—one that can guide strategic decisions and galvanize support for your newest Bloom.pm accelerator cohort.\n\nFeel free to adapt these examples to your exact numbers and the real distribution gleaned from your applicant data. Good luck with your presentation, and we hope these suggestions help you deliver insights that are both **compelling** and **actionable**!",

The average time to diagnose PCOS is over two years, and many women are prescribed generic pills that fail to address the root cause of their condition.   I identified this issue through my own struggle with PCOS and the frustration of receiving incomplete or ineffective treatments. But beyond my personal experience, I noticed a critical lack of awareness among women—every time I spoke with girls experiencing irregular cycles, they knew something was wrong, but they didn’t have the knowledge or the right medical guidance to understand their hormonal health. Many didn’t even know the term PCOS.   Shockingly, this wasn’t just the case in Lebanon—it was the same in France during my master’s studies. Even in developed healthcare systems, women are left navigating their hormonal imbalances without proper education or solutions. This global gap in awareness and healthcare accessibility inspired me to build Inbalance—a platform that ensures women receive the knowledge, diagnosis, and treatment they truly deserve.\tInbalance is an AI-powered health platform that helps women easily track, diagnose, and manage hormonal imbalances such as PCOS, and  thyroid disorders.  Millions of women struggle with hormonal issues, yet 60% remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, and it takes an average of 4-6 years to receive proper care. Many are given generic treatments like birth control, which fail to address the root cause. At Inbalance, we simplify women’s healthcare by providing:  🔹 AI-driven diagnosis & personalized treatment plans – Our smart system analyzes medical history, symptoms, menstrual cycles, and lifestyle factors to provide 95% accurate diagnoses and tailored health recommendations.   🔹 Easy health tracking through text and image – Users can track their symptoms, periods, mood, and physical changes by simply entering text descriptions or uploading images (e.g., skin conditions, weight changes). Our AI analyzes this data to detect patterns and provide insights.   🔹 Expert-guided care – Women get direct access to endocrinologists, gynecologists, nutritionists, and mental health professionals, ensuring they receive the right care beyond generic medications.   🔹 A supportive community – Our platform offers a safe space for women to share experiences, get advice, and stay motivated on their health journey.

I first identified this issue through my background in agricultural and environmental engineering, where I studied the challenges of conventional farming. Additionally, my hands-on experience in hydroponics during my internship at BeLeaf exposed me to innovative, resource-efficient solutions.

One of the biggest pillars of support has been Nawaya, whose funding and mentorship gave me the push to establish my mini farm. Their guidance helped me move from an idea to an actual operating business, allowing me to invest in the right infrastructure and begin production. I also want to celebrate my family, especially my husband, Hussein. His knowledge of agriculture and experience in pest management have been invaluable. From day one, he stood by me, helping refine our farming techniques and ensuring that our crops thrive. His father, too, brought wisdom from years of farming, proving that tradition and innovation can work hand in hand.

This results in high electricity bills, limited access to hot water, and frequent frustration.    I first thought about a solution when I realized that many times we turn on the boiler but either don’t use the heated water or only use a small portion of it. We do this to ensure hot water is available in case we decide to take a bath, avoiding the long wait time of nearly an hour. This was especially frustrating as electricity bills kept rising, and debt to the electricity company and generator owner kept increasing. At one point, the generator owner even threatened to cut the power supply. All of this was happening during Lebanon’s financial crisis, which I was personally experiencing. This pushed me to find a more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable solution—leading to the development of Ecobath.    With an **on-demand and fast water heater**, we only turn it on when we are sure we will take a bath. Since it heats water quickly and only the required amount, there is no fear of long waiting times or unnecessary energy consumption.\tEcobath is a bath water heater that heats only the required amount, saving electricity, reducing heating time, and minimizing pollution.\tYes\tIDEALAB and REAF with Berytech and Park Innovation.\tWord of Mouth\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tdara@bloom.pm\tYes\t8, #ERROR!, #ERROR!, #ERROR!\t8\t4\tIt was lovely to hear the positive feedback from most people!, The startup guesthouse in Akkar, and the glasses startup, the app for special needs (little stars), All the teams in my room (I don't remember all the startups names) gave me valuable advices in my main challenge, an electrical engineering also gave valuable advice regarding the latest technologies in electricity (I forgot the startup name, she's a female) I want to celebrate her.\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nBeaver Ed in ACSI4\tJana Barhouche\tjanafbarhouche@gmail.com\tBeaver Ed\tFirst and foremost, what’s motivating me right now is the chance to work in education. I studied economics at university and tried different jobs in finance, market research, and entrepreneurship. I didn’t realize it at the time, but with each experience and interaction, I was slowly uncovering my passion for education and its potential—when done right. So when my older brother, Rayan, pitched the idea of working together on an educational game and asked me to handle the educational program and operations, you can imagine how excited I was! Second, Rayan and I had always talked about how great it would be to work together. We’re well aware of the challenges of working with family, but we also know each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Our skills are complementary, and we share a similar vision and passion. These past few months have only reinforced that. I’m working full-time while Rayan is part-time, and we’re following the EOS model for our meetings and accountability. Having such a synergetic team and a healthy, empowering work environment has been a blessing. And finally, let’s be real—starting a startup in Lebanon is overwhelming, especially since I fully committed to Beaver in October 2024, right when the war escalated. But weirdly enough, that challenge has been motivating. I get to structure my time based on my energy, really understand my limits and strengths, and push myself accordingly. I love learning, and in my last job, I hit a plateau. So this new adventure is the perfect mix—working on something I’m passionate about, with a mission I truly believe in, while also constantly learning. Honestly, I could go on and on about this question, but in short—I’m really happy with my decision to dive headfirst into this unknown adventure. It just feels right!\tI am the managing partner at Beaver, responsible for operations and the development of our educational program. I’ll also be leading our market testing, which kicks off in early March with a Lebanese school and various scout groups. As our team grows, I will transition into the CEO role. I bring strong organizational skills, responsibility, and creative problem-solving—key qualities for managing operations and tackling day-to-day challenges. But I believe my greatest strengths, are my resilience and perseverance. When I was 12, I was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, a chronic condition marked by joint pain and fatigue. It began with my right hand and gradually spread to all my joints, including both hands, knees, ankles, back, and neck. Rather than giving up, I chose to see it as both a challenge and a gift. Living with it has never been easy, but I am grateful for what it has taught me: patience, perseverance, empathy, the courage to ask for help, and adaptability. It’s also taught me to remain optimistic and keep going, no matter the difficulties.  Beyond that, my leadership experience in volunteer movements has been instrumental in shaping how I approach education. My years in scouting helped me understand the incredible potential kids have when given the freedom to create. I founded two new units—one for girls aged 8 to 12 and another for teenage girls aged 12 to 17—before becoming the first female leader of my 35-year-old scout group. I led 300 boys and girls aged 8 to 24 and trained the leaders of nine different units. That experience taught me how to lead diverse teams, work with people from different backgrounds and age groups, and recognize the unique potential in each individual—something that directly aligns with Beaver Ed’s mission. Ultimately, I bring a mix of structure, creativity, and resilience to the team, all of which are crucial in shaping both our educational program and the company’s future.\thttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jana-barhouche/\tFemale\t25-29\tLebanon\tLebanon\t96171981638\t2024-10-07\tLebanon\tYes\tEducation; General / Other\tSDG GOAL 4: Quality Education:::SDG GOAL 5: Gender Equality:::SDG GOAL 3: Good Health and Well-being:::SDG GOAL 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth:::SDG GOAL 9: Industry / Innovation / Infrastructure:::SDG GOAL 1: No Poverty:::SDG GOAL 10: Reduced Inequality:::SDG GOAL 12: Responsible Consumption and Production\tOur mission is to provide an educational tool that allows students to experiment with theories learned in class, making learning more tangible, engaging, and effective. We aim to empower kids to discover their unique strengths while fostering problem-solving, teamwork, creativity, divergent thinking, and acceptance of different perspectives. Beaver Ed is revolutionizing education by combining hands-on construction kits with digital learning, equipping students with essential skills for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Education was structured around memorization, pre-made solutions, and rigid right-or-wrong answers, leaving no room for exploration or discovery. This system was originally designed to produce disciplined factory workers—but in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is no longer effective. Also, the lack of hands-on discovery and experimentation can reduce information retention to as low as 5%. This is supported by both the Learning Pyramid and the research of Joyce and Showers, which emphasize the importance of experiential and hands-on learning in increasing information retention to 90%.  Our firsthand experience reinforced this realization. My co-founder, Rayan, founded Bildits, a realistic construction toy integrated into 200+ schools in 5 countries. In 2020, he sold Bildits to a Dubai-based consortium, which is now expanding it into schools across the UAE, KSA, and Europe. I worked at Bildits as an instructor, and together, we saw how hands-on tools transformed the learning experience, making education more engaging, interactive, and effective. One key insight from Bildits was that schools want to innovate but are often hesitant to adopt solutions that add logistical complexity. This inspired us to create Beaver Ed—a hands-on, discovery-based learning tool that seamlessly integrates into classrooms without adding extra workload for teachers or schools.  To validate our idea, we conducted interviews with parents, students, teachers, and school principals:  - Students want more than just theoretical lessons and standardized exams—they want learning to be fun, interactive, and rooted in real-world experiences.  - Parents seek customized learning approaches that recognize their children’s unique strengths. Many feel the traditional system undervalues creativity, social skills, and problem-solving, often harming self-esteem.  - Teachers want their students to excel in official exams but are limited by rigid national curricula. Many try to introduce innovative methods, but these efforts rely on their personal motivation and extra effort.  - School principals aim to advance their institutions but tend to avoid solutions that require significant structural changes or additional workload. Beaver Ed is designed to address the needs of all stakeholders—offering an effortless yet impactful solution that transforms learning into a more engaging, effective, and future-proof experience.  Additionally, the World Economic Forum's report, Schools of the Future: Defining New Models of Education for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, emphasizes the urgent need for educational transformation. Traditional curricula fail to prepare students for the demands of the future workforce. Schools must prioritize creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, and lifelong learning—all of which are at the core of Beaver Ed.\tMixing hands-on and online learning for a better education, Beaver Ed is a construction educational kit designed for schools to help students understand and manually explore the scientific and mathematical concepts they learn in class. The kit aims to promote pure, raw creativity using simple construction materials: wooden bars. Additionally, it provides access to an educational program and a gamified experience that blends real-world applications with digital fun. Our goal is to empower kids to discover and believe in their unique strengths and to guide education towards problem-solving, teamwork, creativity, divergent thinking, and the acceptance of diverse perspectives.  The Beaver physical kit is a hands-on construction tool that includes 50 cm wooden sticks, a safe cutter that allows customizable cuts, and different types of recycled plastic joints for 90-degree and multi-angle connections and rotations. The kit also features a rope for creating mechanisms like cranks, pivoting joints, or even wooden gears, allowing students to construct various structures. We call this 'raw creativity.'    As for schools enrolled in the Beaver Educational Program, each year, the students will receive a kit and participate in monthly challenges via our educational platform. These challenges require students to apply classroom theories in real-world scenarios using our kit. Our curriculum is customized for each school and program, ensuring alignment with their theoretical curriculum. For example, rather than simply drawing a 4 cm line, students might be tasked with connecting two desks by building a bridge. They would measure the distance and cut wooden pieces to the correct length. Challenges start with simple tasks and progress to advanced applications of physics and math concepts. For instance, students may be challenged to construct a crane, considering factors like momentum, range of motion, and weight support.  After each challenge, the Beaver team reviews submissions, providing feedback to students and teachers on both academic and non-graded skills, like creativity, to highlight each student’s unique strengths.    Additionally, we offer a gamified approach to these challenges. In collaboration with online education platforms like Synthesis, which use digital games for learning, Beaver can be integrated into these digital environments. When a character in the game encounters an obstacle, students can construct a physical solution with the Beaver kit, then scan their structure to appear on screen for their character to use. For instance, if the character needs to climb a wall, students build a ladder, scan it, and their character can then climb it. Students can build various structures to assist their character—like bridges, catapults, planes, or boats—blending hands-on creativity with digital learning.\tNo\tWe didn't participate in a program under Beaver Ed yet.

Personally, I'm always inspired by the young people in Lebanon. They've got so much potential, and despite all the tough stuff they face, they keep pushing forward. That keeps me going too. Professionally, I’ve been in the startup scene for a while, working on small projects here and there. But for 2025, my new year revolution was that I decided it was time to go big. I wanted to build something that could grow and let me finally quit my UN job. So, here I am, probably on the coldest night of the year, filling out this application, ready to take my shot with my baby Takadam. It’s not just about building a new platform; it’s about setting up a future where every young person can grab the chances they deserve.\tAs the driving force behind our team, I consider myself both the fuel and the dynamo. My role is to keep us moving forward, harnessing my seven years of experience in empowering youth at both national and regional levels. My technical skills in coding and web development allow us to use technology not just effectively, but impactfully. I bring a constant stream of ideas and an endless supply of motivation, pushing our team to innovate and excel in creating meaningful opportunities for the youth.\thttps://www.linkedin.com/in/hany-anan/\tMale\t25-29\tLebanon\tLebanon\t96170300206\t2021-04-20\tLebanon\tYes\tTechnology; General / Other\tSDG GOAL 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth:::SDG GOAL 4: Quality Education\tThrough Takadam, I aim to make a significant impact on several Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Our objective is to empower at least 10,000 young individuals in Lebanon within the first two years by connecting them to educational and employment opportunities that match their skills and aspirations. By providing a platform that simplifies the search and application process for opportunities, we aim to increase the employment rate among our users by 25% and enhance their educational outcomes, as evidenced by a 30% increase in scholarship and training program enrollments. Moreover, we plan to reduce the opportunity gap for women and underrepresented communities by ensuring that at least 40% of our beneficiaries come from these groups. Long-term, Takadam seeks to be a catalyst for economic stability and social equity, contributing to a more informed, employed, and equitable society, where every individual has the chance to thrive.\tTech & Innovation:::Entrepreneurship\t3.2.

This issue stems from a fragmented information landscape where opportunities are scattered across various platforms, often buried in noise or not tailored to individual needs and qualifications.  I first identified this problem through my extensive work with youth in entrepreneurship training and social development programs. Over the years, I observed a recurring pattern: many young individuals were either unaware of the opportunities available to them or found the application process too daunting and time-consuming. This led to high levels of frustration and missed chances that could potentially alter their career paths and educational journeys.  Recognizing the critical gap between available opportunities and the youth’s access to them, I was motivated to develop a centralized platform that not only aggregates these opportunities but also offers tools to streamline and personalize the search process. Takadam aims to bridge this gap, making it easier for young individuals to find and apply for opportunities that can truly change their lives.\tTakadam is a dynamic digital platform designed to revolutionize how young people in Lebanon access and leverage opportunities for personal and professional development. Our solution addresses the complex challenge of opportunity discovery and application by centralizing a vast array of opportunities—including jobs, internships, scholarships, workshops, and more—into a single, user-friendly platform.  What sets Takadam apart is its smart matching technology, which personalizes the search experience based on the user’s profile, preferences, and past interactions. This ensures that users don't just find opportunities; they find the right opportunities that match their skills and aspirations. Additionally, our platform provides essential tools such as deadline reminders, application tracking, and eligibility filters to simplify the process and reduce the time users spend searching for and applying to opportunities.  Our aim is to empower the youth of Lebanon by making opportunity access as straightforward and efficient as possible, ultimately fostering a more connected and informed community that can thrive in an increasingly competitive world.\tYes\tInjaz Company Program UNDP Youth Leadership Programme Incubation Bloom Hackathon in partnership with FNF AUB Innovation Park\tBloom Social Media\tI am excited to hear back from you very soon!

As three sisters living in different countries, we’ve always shared a deep appreciation for beauty, storytelling, and the power of thoughtful design. Whether through art, interiors, or branding, we’ve seen firsthand how aesthetics influence emotions and well-being.  We created Home of Flora to bridge this gap; bringing nature-inspired, soulful designs into everyday products, spaces, and brand experiences. We first identified this when walking into spaces that felt empty, seeing products that lacked soul, and realizing how much warmth and meaning could be added through thoughtful design. The more we observed, the more we saw a gap in the market for brands that wanted to connect with people on a deeper level but lacked the artistic vision to do so. That’s where we knew we could make a difference.\tHome of Flora is a design studio founded by three sisters, united by a shared passion: to brighten up people's life with our signature art.

Whether through art licensing, custom patterns, or product collaborations, we help brands integrate beauty and nature into their offerings in a way that feels authentic and deeply engaging.  For us, it’s never just about creating something beautiful, it’s about making people feel something. We want our art to turn ordinary moments into meaningful ones, to bring a sense of calm, nostalgia, or joy.

The fashion industry is one of the largest polluters, and I believe we can change that by embracing sustainability, ethical production, and conscious consumption. My goal is to not only introduce eco-friendly alternatives but also to raise awareness about the importance of making mindful choices when it comes to clothing.  I want to empower consumers to make more informed, sustainable decisions and encourage designers and brands to prioritize the environment in their processes. By creating a more circular fashion system—where materials are reused, waste is minimized, and garments are designed to last longer—I hope to contribute to a healthier planet and promote an eco-conscious lifestyle that transcends just fashion but influences the way we approach all aspects of consumption.\tEntrepreneurship\t3.1.

Fashion is one of the most polluting industries in the world, with millions of tons of clothing ending up in landfills each year. Waste comes not only from discarded garments but also from unsold inventory, textile offcuts, and the constant demand for 'newness' that leads to excessive production.  I first identified this issue while observing the growing amount of discarded textiles in landfills and the increasing awareness around sustainability. I realized that a major part of the problem lies in the linear 'take-make dispose' model of fashion. It became clear that there is a need for a shift toward a more circular approach designing clothes that are made to last, are recyclable, or can be upcycled, and ultimately creating a zero-waste fashion line that minimizes environmental harm.\tMy startup is dedicated to revolutionizing the fashion industry by upcycling second hand fabrics and repurposing already existing materials to create stylish, high quality garments. The goal is to minimize the environmental impact of fashion by giving new life to pre loved textiles that would otherwise go to waste. We source materials from vintage garments, surplus fabric from manufacturers, and discarded textiles, transforming them into unique, one of a kind pieces.  Our solution lies in our sustainable design approach, where we creatively repurpose these materials to craft collections that are not only eco friendly but also affordable and fashion forward. By reducing the demand for new fabrics and promoting the reuse of existing materials, we help reduce textile waste and lessen the strain on resources, all while supporting a more circular economy.  Through this approach, we aim to challenge the fast fashion industry’s reliance on mass production and disposal, offering consumers a more responsible and stylish alternative. Our pieces are not just sustainable they are also unique and tell a story, allowing customers to wear fashion that aligns with their values and supports a more sustainable future.\tYes\tDezain bootcamp 2023\tWord of Mouth\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tYes\t7, #ERROR!\t8\t4\tThe community is not working fine with me\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nSustainable Stitch in ACSI4\tLilian Malaeb\tsustainablestitchinitiative@gmail.com\tSustainable Stitch\tRight now, I’m deeply motivated by the tangible impact Sustainable Stitch is creating—both environmentally and socially.

At the same time, GBV survivors and marginalized women face limited economic opportunities, struggling to achieve financial independence. This gap between waste and unemployment creates an opportunity for sustainable, income-generating solutions. How We Identified the Problem •    While working closely with marginalized communities and women-led initiatives, we saw two critical issues: Women, especially GBV survivors, lacked stable income despite having valuable sewing skills. Tons of fabric waste from manufacturers and households ended up in landfills, worsening environmental pollution. By combining these challenges, we realized that upcycling textile waste into marketable products could reduce waste, empower women, and create a circular economy. This led to the creation of Sustainable Stitch—a solution that transforms discarded fabrics into sustainable tote bags while ensuring fair wages and financial stability for women.\tSustainable Stitch – A Circular Solution for Waste & Economic Empowerment: Sustainable Stitch is a social enterprise that tackles textile waste and economic marginalization by repurposing unwanted fabrics and tetra packs into unique, sustainable tote bags. We provide GBV survivors and marginalized women from Lebanon & Syria with skills training, fair wages, and stable income opportunities, empowering them to become financially independent.  Our Solution - Upcycling Textile Waste: We collect discarded fabrics and tetra packs, transforming them into handmade, durable tote bags, reducing landfill waste. Women’s Economic Empowerment: We train and employ GBV survivors & vulnerable women in sewing, upcycling, and business skills, ensuring fair trade wages. - Sustainable & Ethical Production: Our process follows zero-waste, ethical labor, and circular economy principles, promoting environmental and social sustainability. - Community-Led Recycling Initiatives: We organize workshops in rural Chouf, engaging women and youth in sorting & repurposing textile waste into curtains, rugs, and pillow stuffing.  By bridging waste reduction and economic inclusion, Sustainable Stitch is creating a circular, fair, and sustainable future for both people and the planet\tNo\tWe only received support from Doria Feminist Fund\tBloom Newsletter\tDuring the war in Lebanon, Sustainable Stitch responded by supporting women and newborns with essential supplies, ensuring they could survive displacement and harsh shelter conditions.

This will reduce our reliance on expensive fertilizers and the associated costs of plowing, fertilization, and time consumption. Seed Fermentation: Due to their high sugar content, seeds will undergo a specific fermentation process to create a natural fermentation enhancer. This further reduces our reliance on external inputs and ensures organic compost rich in beneficial minerals, especially nitrogen. Sustainable Practices: GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) and IPM (Integrated Pest Management): Implementing these practices will lead to the construction of a Phytosanitary Program (PSP), promoting sustainable and environmentally friendly farming methods. Full Agricultural Cycle: By adopting these measures, we initiate a complete agricultural cycle for the site, minimizing waste, maximizing resource utilization, and promoting sustainable practices. Educational Platform: Murex Farms will serve as a platform for training Lebanese students, providing opportunities for them to develop their master's or PhD thesis on an annual basis. Improving Gender Awareness and Youth Inclusion: Job Opportunities: Murex Farms will offer new job opportunities for recently graduated students, covering various disciplines such as agricultural engineering and food chemistry.

They are experiencing several challenges throughout the agricultural supply chain (Hesba). A few examples of the challenges are (1) low financial return, (2) middle-men brokerage fees, (3) unorganized logistics, (4) late payments, (5) lack of targeted cultivation, and (6) lack of export standards.   Therefore, the above-mentioned reasons reduce farmers' motivation to expand and produce high-quality food. Reports indicate that entire farming communities in Jordan are discarding their tomato harvests in the streets because the prices are low that transporting them to market is not worth the effort. As a result, farmers who are key stakeholders essential to the vitality of the food economy lack the incentive to increase both production and quality.\tGhoorcom (Arabic: غوركم) is an online marketplace that connects between farmers and retailers/businesses directly across Jordan.

Syria has given us a lot and is like a mother who gave everything she could to her children even when we did not meet her with the same giving, today Syria is bleeding and since childhood I have dedicated myself to protecting this country and that the method and plan differ according to my age and mental abilities in each period, but the goal is clear.

In workplaces, employees burned out under relentless pressure. In communities, people searched for stability amid the shifting landscape. Even wellness programs, meant to offer relief, often felt disconnected—imported solutions that failed to acknowledge the intersection of personal struggles, cultural realities, and systemic challenges. As we discussed potential solutions, and scrolled through wellness initiatives online, we couldn’t shake some questions: Why weren’t these programs working? Why did so many people attend mental health workshops only to feel just as stressed days later? Why did companies invest in wellness programs that employees barely engaged with? The answer became clear—wellness wasn’t just an individual pursuit. It had to be embedded into the way people lived, worked, and connected. It had to be accessible, culturally relevant, and deeply rooted in the realities of those it aimed to serve.\tEmBody—a model that doesn’t just teach wellness but integrates it into real-world contexts.

Additionally, social, and cultural theater to foster community engagement and creativity.  Another core aspect of the camp is the production of organic compost through the composting of organic waste. To encourage sustainable waste practices, we require organic waste to be delivered in reusable containers rather than plastic bags. In return, we provide compost to individuals, motivating them to adopt eco-friendly habits by using containers instead of disposable bags.  Beyond its practical applications, the camp will also serve as an educational platform.

E-waste contains toxic materials like lead, mercury, and cadmium that, when dumped in landfills or incinerated, release harmful greenhouse gases and pollutants, contaminating air, soil, and water.  I first identified this problem while working in both the engineering and education fields. In civil engineering, I observed the environmental degradation caused by unregulated waste disposal sites, often littered with discarded electronics. Later, as a robotics trainer and digital marketing facilitator, I noticed how quickly technology becomes obsolete, leading to a surge in discarded devices with little public awareness about their environmental impact.  What stood out was the lack of proper e-waste recycling facilities and the absence of public education on responsible disposal. Communities often resort to throwing old electronics into regular waste streams, unaware of the long-term environmental and climate consequences.  This realization sparked the idea for an e-waste recycling project that not only addresses the disposal issue but also focuses on climate action—reducing emissions, promoting recycling, and educating communities on sustainable practices.\tE-waste is one of the fastest-growing waste streams, contributing significantly to environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions when improperly disposed of. In many communities, there is limited access to responsible recycling options, leading to electronics ending up in landfills, where toxic components harm the environment and contribute to climate change. our solution: E-waste Collection & Recycling: We set up accessible collection points where individuals and businesses can safely dispose of old electronics. Collected e-waste is sorted, and valuable materials like metals and plastics are extracted and reintroduced into the manufacturing cycle, reducing the need for raw material extraction and lowering carbon emissions.\tNo\t..\tBloom Social Media\t..\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tYes\t7, #ERROR!\t7\t4\tIt was a great experience and a real step on the path to leadership.\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nTazwedco in ACSI4\tMohammed Bikdash\tmohammedbikdashq@gmail.com\tTazwedco\tPersonally: I am motivated by my vision to make a real impact in the e-commerce and supply sector, where I strive to develop innovative solutions that streamline business operations and enhance efficiency between suppliers and store owners.

This gap makes it difficult for women to focus on their own personal or professional goals, as they struggle to find reliable childcare for their children.  Many communities also suffer from a shortage of after-school childcare options that offer a secure environment for children, focusing on their overall development, well-being, and academic growth. The lack of quality childcare limits children's access to vital support and restricts parents, particularly women, from pursuing work or personal activities.  How I Identified It: This issue was identified through primary data and reports shared in Jordan, as well as my personal experience as a mother and observations within Women’s Networks. Key statistics include:  In Jordan, the labor force participation rate for women is just 14%, compared to 62.8% for men in 2023 (World Bank Gender Data). In 2018, more men than women owned businesses (World Bank Gender Data). Investing in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) in Jordan offers significant benefits, such as increasing educational attainment by 0.7 years, lifetime earnings by $23,113, and life expectancy by one year. Additionally, the societal benefits of ECCE investments outweigh costs by a ratio of 9:1, with the potential to create 30,000 jobs, mostly for women, in the ECCE sector (QRF Report on ECCE Investment).      \tStartup-Overview  Evening Stars Child Center is dedicated to fostering children’s academic success, emotional well-being, and overall development, providing a safe and nurturing environment for children aged 3-14. The center offers after-school programs and academic support to enhance children’s learning and personal growth. At the same time, it empowers mothers by offering flexible childcare services, allowing them the space they need to pursue personal and professional goals. This flexibility helps mothers balance their work and life responsibilities, knowing their children are in a supportive space that nurtures their academic, emotional, and social development. By operating as an evening center, it caters to both children and working mothers, ensuring sustainable growth for the entire family. In addition, the center offers community events and training sessions for caregivers, fostering a supportive environment for both families and staff. Social media will also play a vital role in promoting the center’s activities and engaging the community.  How It Works: Safe, secure, and engaging environment for children aged 3-14 during after-school and evening hours. After-school care, tutoring, and programs focused on academic growth, emotional well-being, and personal development. Providing holistic support for children’s development during the critical evening hours. Flexible childcare hours from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm, allowing mothers to balance career and personal goals. Empowering mothers to pursue work, education, or other activities with peace of mind, knowing their children are in a safe and supportive environment. Awareness events for the community on topics such as child development, parenting, and women’s empowerment, creating a stronger, more informed community around the center. These events and training sessions help build a safe, informed, and supportive environment for both children and mothers.\tNo\tN/A\tOther\tN/A\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tYes\t6\t7\t4\t\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nInfinite Cycle in ACSI4\tAhmad Al Kurdi\ta.kourdi10@gmail.com\tInfinite Cycle\tPersonally, since I am an industrial engineer, I am motivated by continuous learning to upgrade my engineering skills, managerial skills, and more.

But these drivers have one major challenge: poor and slow maintenance and servicing processes that block their work. Besides, maintenance centers and suppliers work separately without any integrated system that allows effective interaction and operational coordination. Such disintegration leads to delays, greater expenses, and wasted productivity for everyone.\tIn general, Infinite Cycle will provide an easy-access application that provides all the services and products that the delivery companies or delivery drivers need in a simple and affordable way.

The impact I aspire to achieve aligns with several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):  1. SDG 2 – Zero Hunger:  Implement regenerative farming techniques to increase organic food production (avocados, olives, and Palestinian pistachios).  Target an annual yield of 500+ kg of organic olives and 300+ kg of avocados within the first five years.    2. SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption & Production:  Use sustainable farming methods such as water-efficient irrigation and organic composting to reduce waste and reliance on chemical fertilizers.  Reduce food waste by 30% through farm-to-table practices in the guesthouses.    3. SDG 13 – Climate Action:  Plant additional 100+ trees within five years to enhance carbon sequestration and biodiversity.  Implement solar-powered energy solutions for guesthouses to reduce carbon footprint.    4. SDG 8 – Decent Work & Economic Growth:  Create 5–10 sustainable jobs in farming, hospitality, and eco-tourism within the first three years.

Have started developing my idea\t3\tYes\tDeclining\tNo\tYes\thttps://www.facebook.com/landscapinglebanon?mibextid=ZbWKwL\tNA\tProblem: Lebanon faces major challenges in sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and environmental conservation. Traditional farming methods often lead to soil depletion, water scarcity, and reduced biodiversity. Meanwhile, tourism development frequently ignores sustainability, leading to excessive resource consumption and environmental degradation. There is a need for a model that integrates regenerative agriculture, responsible tourism, and eco-conscious land use.  How I Identified It: Owning land in Batroun with 80 olive trees, I saw an opportunity to transform it into a self-sustaining ecosystem while addressing food security and environmental concerns. With over 20 years of experience in planting trees and landscaping, I recognized the potential of avocados and Palestinian pistachios to diversify crops while maintaining soil health. Additionally, my 10+ years in hospitality and management highlighted the growing demand for eco-tourism experiences that respect nature. By combining sustainable farming with eco-friendly guesthouses, I aim to offer a holistic, sustainable, and economically viable solution that benefits both the land and the community.\tMy startup is a sustainable agro-tourism project in Batroun, Lebanon, combining regenerative farming with eco-friendly hospitality. The land, home to 80 olive trees, will be expanded with avocado orchards and grafted Palestinian pistachios, promoting biodiversity and soil regeneration. Alongside sustainable agriculture, I plan to develop eco-conscious guesthouses, offering visitors an immersive experience in nature, organic food, and responsible tourism.  Solution: My project addresses two major challenges:  1. Sustainable Agriculture & Food Security  Implementing water-efficient irrigation, organic composting, and regenerative farming to increase yield and soil fertility.  Diversifying crops with avocados and Palestinian pistachios to enhance resilience to climate change and boost local food production.    2. Eco-Tourism & Sustainable Hospitality  Building guesthouses with eco-friendly materials and renewable energy sources (e.g., solar power, rainwater harvesting). Promoting farm-to-table experiences, reducing food waste by 30% and supporting local farmers/artisans.  Creating 5–10 sustainable jobs in farming, hospitality, and tourism within the first three years.   By integrating sustainable agriculture and responsible tourism, my startup will preserve Lebanon’s natural resources, empower the local community, and promote environmental awareness.\tNo\tNA\tBloom Newsletter\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tdara@bloom.pm\tYes\t6, #ERROR!\t6\t4\ti like to celebrate Abir Chamandy, i really admire what she is doing not everyone has it in them but she definitely is unique.\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nEco Mosaic in ACSI4\tMirna Mohamd Adnan Al Dada\tmirnamosaic@gmail.com\tEco Mosaic\tI am an Artist, I Do awareness sessions , and work shop regarding everything that has to do with recycling and upcycling material, also we use resin\tI am the owner and the leader of the team, and it is all about motivation and sustainability\tI don't have one\tFemale\t40+\tLebanon\tLebanon\t96171474277\t2025-02-05\tLebanon\tYes\tDesign\tSDG GOAL 12: Responsible Consumption and Production:::SDG GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:::SDG GOAL 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth:::SDG GOAL 15: Life on Land\tWell in recycling we use approximately  1 tom of plastic a year in recycling which saves between 2 to 3 toms of CO2 emissions l, which also leads to approximately 30% less in the use of energy\tTech & Innovation:::Education & life long learning:::Entrepreneurship\t\"2.1.

As a result, farmers were forced to discard large quantities of their harvest. This raised a critical question in my mind: How can we make use of this wasted produce To explore a solution, I partnered with a local fresh juice producer, providing him with a batch of apples for juicing. That’s when I noticed the significant amount of pomace left behind. This wasn’t just an issue with apples it was happening across the entire food processing chain with different products. Tons of organic byproducts were being discarded, while livestock farmers are facing rising feed costs. Seeing this gap, I decided to take action. I started reaching out to food processors, collecting their organic waste, and formulating it into a nutritious, sustainable livestock feed mix.\tDr. Feed is all about turning food and agricultural waste into valuable livestock feed, creating a sustainable and affordable solution for farmers. The challenge we’re solving comes in two forms: high-moisture waste, which is difficult to store and spoils quickly, and low-moisture waste, which can be repurposed more easily. For high-moisture waste, we developed an innovative machine that can pack 500 kg of waste per hour, keeping it fresh and usable without high costs. For low-moisture waste, we created a system that formulates it into a full, balanced feed mix, helping farmers lower their costs while maintaining high-quality nutrition for their livestock.\tYes\tAgrytech\tBloom Social Media\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tdara@bloom.pm\tYes\t6\t6\t3\t\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nBee lal in ACSI4\tBilal abdelraouf othman\tothman.bilal@hotmail.com\tBee lal\tPersonally & Professionally Motivated By: \"I am driven by my goal of expanding and developing my beekeeping business, as it continues to grow.

The moisture content in honey varies based on climate conditions and the  floral sources of nectar. Lebanon’s hot and humid summer, along with its moderate yet humid  winter, creates an environment that significantly increases honey's moisture levels. According to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (an international body established by the FAO  and WHO, World Health Organization), the acceptable maximum moisture content for honey is  19%. Exceeding this threshold compromises the quality of honey and leads to: • Fermentation and spoilage • Altered texture and reduced viscosity. • Diminished health benefits. • Negative impacts on taste and aroma. These changes compromise the quality of honey\thoney dehydration machine. Reducing Moisture Content The machine lowers water content to acceptable levels (below 19%), preventing  fermentation and spoilage. 2. Maintaining Nutritional Value By reducing the risk of bacterial or fungal activity, the machine ensures honey retains its  natural enzymes and vitamins. 3. Improving Texture and Density Controlled moisture levels enhance the density and texture, making honey more  appealing to consumers. 4. Ensuring Export Compliance Many international markets have stringent standards for honey moisture content. This  machine guarantees compliance, facilitating access to global markets. 5. Preserving Flavor and Color Proper moisture control maintains honey’s natural flavor and color, enhancing its overall  quality.\tYes\tgil program training\tOther\tthank u😁\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tYes\t5\t7\t3\t\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nGreen Fodder in ACSI4\tAyoub Chami Nasr\tayoubchami.ns@gmail.com\tGreen Fodder\tMy motivation is launching ventures that matter.

This project aims to:   Promote Sustainable Agriculture (SDG 2 & 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production): - Reduce water consumption for fodder production by 80% compared to conventional methods, addressing water scarcity challenges. - Decrease land usage for fodder cultivation by 50% by utilizing vertical or controlled environment growing systems. - Minimize or eliminate the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, resulting in a 95% reduction in agricultural chemical runoff.  Improve Economic Well-being (SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth): - Increase farmer profitability by 30% through increased livestock productivity.    Improve Livestock Health (SDG 3-Good Health and Well-being): - Reduce livestock disease related losses by 30% by providing them with high quality and consistent nutrition. - Increase the nutrition value of the fodder by 40%  compared to traditional fodder.   Climate Action (SDG 13): - Reduce the carbon footprint of livestock feed production by 3p% by reducing the transportation of feed, and reducing the use of farm equipment used to harvest traditional feed.  These quantified metrics, tracked over time, will demonstrate the project's impact on food security, environmental sustainability, and economic development. By focusing on these measurable outcomes, we can create a scalable and replicable model for sustainable livestock farming.\tOther\t\"2.1.
