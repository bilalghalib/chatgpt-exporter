Now that that is taken care of, it's time to get back to the agreement and follow up on our last conversation. I recall discussing the liability, and Dr. Saad and I agree that it's true; we are working as a team. That was especially clear in the last few weeks of collaborating on the proposal. \n\nThis weekend, Dr. Saad and I updated the agreement and included a new liability clause indicating mutual liability for our joint decisions. You can see that in our document here:\nWe also translated the agreement into an Arabic PDF , including the new liability section, which you can find and comment on here. \n\nWe are open to receiving virtual feedback and would be happy to schedule a virtual meeting with Dr. Saad and me this week to review the agreement before finalizing with Nova and proceeding further with the project.\n\nThank you, and have a great day.\nBilal Ghalib\n",

It's a testament to our effective teamwork, and I'm excited to carry this momentum forward.\n\nFollowing our previous discussion regarding liability concerns, Dr. Saad and I have reached a consensus. We both recognize the importance of working cohesively as a team, which was evident in our joint efforts on the proposal.\n\nTo reflect this understanding, we have revised the agreement to include a new clause that addresses mutual liability in our joint decisions. This update aims to strengthen our collaboration and ensure a balanced approach to shared responsibilities.\n\nWe have also translated the updated agreement into Arabic, inclusive of the new liability section, for your convenience. You can access and review the updated document here [Insert Link to Document]. Your insights and feedback on these changes would be highly valuable.\n\nTo facilitate a thorough review and address any concerns you may have, we propose scheduling a virtual meeting with Dr. Saad and myself.
