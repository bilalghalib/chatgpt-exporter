      "content": "I need help with this post. Take on the mindset of someone seeing this on linnked in and think of 5 pros and 5 cons and help me design it to be more interesting and useful for people:\nHave you ever felt a bit slimy after using chatGPT to make a post for you, or when google attempted to write an email to your mom?\nWell, I'm exploring ways to use generative AI in a way that leaves you feeling in charge, elevated and proud. My work on LLM frameworks for that will be my next post, today we talk about #artificialCrafts and my work exploring generative images. \n I've been dreaming and working on Wayway.AI for a while and I have something new to offer, a drawing tool that let's you collect organized data for machine learning experiments around #artificialCraft - We are able to create images through pixels with gradient descent yet it has nothing to do with how art is made. With LLMs, the process of embeddings and attention mechanisms seems to have some biomimetic principles, mid-journey, and other generative AI for images \"magically\" create people out of nowhere. Exploring craftsmanship and machine learning is giving me insights on the importance of pride as an indicator of appropriate technological use. \nDeveloping your unique drawing style is a continual practice, and any AI trained to draw like you will only draw as you do up till the point you stop training it. That process is murderous and requires tuning and identifying your traits and qualities. Through the machine learning training process you will identify the unconcious unique stylistic elements. The goal is that through all this, the machine that draws like you will be the work of art representing your efforts at conveying your style, and it will not just produce things to copy you, it will mimic the Picasso quote when he attempted to sell a drawing that took him 30 mins for 5,000$ and was rebuffed. He retorted - it took me my whole life to make this drawing. It really is about pride.\nI'm not yet done yet I wanted to share some thoughts on my work on artificial crafts and the fact that there are different ways to use generative AI. Ways that leave you feeling clean and not slimy. \nYou can see a video walking over my research question and the website I'm building to answer it here: https://www.loom.com/share/17174847ad124f01b4e7703f97c8b95d?sid=7466e9ad-f485-46ce-98d4-3ecaf50415b8\nAnd the project here:\n https://wayway.ai ",

By exploring generative AI in ways that make you feel empowered and proud, I’m developing frameworks that put you in charge. Today, let’s dive into #ArtificialCrafts and my work with generative images.\n\nFor a while, I’ve been dreaming and working on Wayway.AI, and now I have something new to offer—a drawing tool that helps you collect organized data for machine learning experiments around #ArtificialCraft. Imagine creating images with gradient descent; while it’s not traditional art, it mimics some principles of human creativity. \n\nGenerative AI like mid-journey \"magically\" creates people, but my focus is on how craftsmanship in machine learning gives insights into the importance of pride in using technology. Developing your unique drawing style is a continuous practice. Any AI trained to draw like you will only reflect your style up to the point you stop training it. This rigorous process helps you discover your unconscious stylistic elements, making the AI a true representation of your artistic journey.\n\nInspired by Picasso’s sentiment—charging $5,000 for a drawing that took a lifetime to perfect—my goal is to ensure the AI's output is not just a copy but a proud continuation of your work.\n\nI’m still working on this, but I wanted to share my thoughts on artificial crafts and how to use generative AI in a way that feels clean and empowering.\n\n**Watch my video explaining my research questions and see the website I’m building here: [Loom Video](https://www.loom.com/share/17174847ad124f01b4e7703f97c8b95d?sid=7466e9ad-f485-46ce-98d4-3ecaf50415b8)**\n\n**Explore the project: [Wayway.AI](https://wayway.ai)**\n\n---\n\nThis revised post incorporates visual breaks, a clear call to action, and a more structured format to make it engaging and easy to read on LinkedIn.",

      "content": "take some content from here and be sure it sounds more like me than some generic AI:\n0:01 Hello, so I wanted to show you a project that I'm working on called Wayway.ai. The question that I'm trying to answer with this project is about craftsmanship.\n0:10 There's a story about uh Picasso, where someone sent next to him and he drew them for 30 seconds and then tried to sell them that drawing for an exorbitant amount of money and they were baffled.\n0:25 They like it took me 30 seconds to do that and Picasso retorts. It actually took me my entire life. So, my question is about artificial intelligence and machine learning and work.\n0:40 And effort and pride. I worked for hours the other day on an essay that I didn't write a single word of, but when I was done working with the AI, I felt proud of my work.\n0:52 I felt like I had something worthwhile to share. And there's a question to ask about all of the mid-journey stuff.\n1:00 And the- the difference I think between mid-journey and other generative AI and large language models is that large language models I think are more biomimetic in how they create their content.\n1:13 And there's a way of using them that makes it symbiotic where your intelligence can- encourage more easily with their intelligence.\n1:22 Things like generative AI that makes images and videos are working on the pixel level. There's no meaning uh to these- these generated images besides kind of a gradient descent and approximating what- what kind of good looks like in a sense.\n1:40 But uh the thing that I'm exploring here is can we actually make artificial craftsmanship where you hone a machine that feels like it's helping you first understand your drawing style and your artistry.\n1:57 And then also making it so that umm . ? It can, it can repeat it. It can do it on its own.\n2:04 And I'm wondering if this will give the artist a sense that they are working with the AI to produce new art or is it going to be something like uhh mid-journey.\n2:19 That is the question. And so what I'd like to do is show you a little bit of a demo about how I'm collecting this and what are some of the insights I've got so far.\n2:27 And so we're going to draw, umm, mortal glass. So this is a very simple tool that I made and there's a reason why it's at least you let it use my microphone.\n2:39 Because let Come just here. Start with the beard over here. I'm going to draw a little scribbly beard. I'm going to draw this kind of squiggly hair.\n2:45 Squiggly squiggly squiggly. Umm, this is uh back. Oh, now let's go down to the eyes and the nose. Ooh, what was that?\n2:53 Yeah, it's going to scribble up in here. Gotta make sure this is a little darker. Okay, we're not going to end this with out.\n3:03 Sing, swing. Okay. I also need a little bit of a body. I'm going to draw the wrinkles. I like drawing the wrinkles like this.\n3:11 Okay. Womp, womp, womp, womp. Shink. His arms kind of behind his back over there. Foot one. And, Okay, that's it.\n3:22 So I'm going to call that done. Then you uh click save data. And it uploads it, I hope. And then what we have over here is an ability to use my microphone.\n3:32 It's because I'm going to start with a beard over here. I'm going to draw a little scribbly beard. And I draw his kind of squiggly hair.\n3:38 Squiggly squiggly squiggly. Umm, this is a bangle. Now it's going down to the eyes. So, what was that? Yeah, you can see.\n3:48 It was able to save both the audio as well as the drawing. And I hope that wasn't uh uh too intense.\n3:59 Umm. And the idea is that I want to bring out the inner monologue and provide it as one of the variables to the machine learning algorithms.\n4:09 And all of this is saved nicely and stored nicely inside of our uh server. And so you can see the metadata.\n4:20 And it has. as. Some information about the username which will be saved along with the record of the image and the height and the width and the start and end time.\n4:31 Uh it'll save everything x, y, z, pressure, tilt. It's designed to be used with an iPad and mycom tablets. And then of course the image.\n4:39 And also. So. The audio file. That we can do some speech text. And before I go I wanted to show you one last thing which is an attempt to also categorize the kinds of stylistic elements that people take.\n4:59 And so. I've been working on. On a way to take just a stream of text data and process it a little bit to try to identify the number of clusters.\n5:09 So the number of unique different ways the person moves the pen. And the way that we do that is uhh through this thing if it doesn't freeze.\n5:20 Yeah. So. So. So. Yeah. So it's finding that at about two or three you get a much reduced number of difference.\n5:32 So if you close this. And I'm gonna pick three. And then you can see black over here is I think the- The straightest like smoothest kind of squiggles.\n5:44 Like zoom zoom zoom. Like come to the circle a bit. Uh yellow are for like the hatches. And then green I think is for like a combination.\n5:53 Cause you can see it goes squiggle, stray, squiggle, stray, squiggle, stray. And we can give these things names right. And so when- When the person is talking and writing, I want to be able to see potentially if we give it enough of a corpus of data, is there some kind of alignment um between this um\n6:11 clustered drawing data. And the uh the drawing data that is tagged automatically by what I'm calling- a rubber d*** method.\n6:22 The rubber d*** method comes from programming where to like get better at programming you just pretend you're talking to a rubber d***.\n6:29 And so to get a better result here with your drawing training we're just talking to it as if it can hear us but but now it can.\n6:36 And so there's been a lot of advancements in AI that I'm leveraging here. . And it's a pretty exciting time to be playing with this stuff.\n6:44 And uh yeah I'm curious to see what you guys think and if there's any feedback that you guys have I'd love to hear it.\n6:52 Uh take care and yeah you can actually play with it. You can go to wayway.ai, make a username and an account and uh start drawing and, I'll see you on the internet.\n7:04 So then bye. Bye.",

The goal is for the AI to not just copy us but to learn and evolve with us, capturing the subtle elements of our style.\n\nHere’s a brief demo of how I’m collecting data and some insights so far. I’ve developed a tool that records the strokes and audio of my creative process, allowing the AI to learn from my inner monologue and improve its understanding of my style.\n\n[Watch my video explaining my research questions and see the website I’m building here.](https://www.loom.com/share/17174847ad124f01b4e7703f97c8b95d?sid=cfb6d261-d562-4c91-ad4a-b449361487f0)\n\nHow do you use AI that feels authentic and empowering?\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #GenerativeAI #DigitalArt #Innovation #Creativity #WaywayAI #AIArt #TechInnovation #Craftsmanship #PrideInWork #artificialCrafts",
