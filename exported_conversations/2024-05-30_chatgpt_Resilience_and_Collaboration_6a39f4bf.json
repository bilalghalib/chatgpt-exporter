As we set up our audio equipment and reflect on the passage of time, it's clear that our focus must shift to how these advancements can foster resilience and post-traumatic growth. This transition is especially pertinent for those like myself, who have delved into learning sciences and now explore the implications of technology on education.\n\nThe wisdom of historical figures like Hölderlin and Confucius reminds us of the dual nature of progress and danger. As we navigate a world fraught with potential self-destruction, ethical education becomes paramount. The competitive ethos prevalent in elite universities may hinder rather than help this cause. Instead, a paradigm shift towards state schools and a \"best for the world\" mentality might better prepare students to tackle global challenges ethically and effectively.\n\nThe concept of intellectual and digital commons underpins our discussion on sustainability and continuous learning. In a dynamic world, where the lifespan of competency is drastically shortening, the need for lifelong learning and adaptability is more pressing than ever. Redesigning educational environments to support this continuous learning journey is essential. This includes fostering collaboration and problem-solving skills to address complex, real-world issues.\n\nOur journey through education isn't just intellectual but deeply emotional. Reflecting on personal experiences, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, we see the importance of resilience and maintaining hope. Learning should be a source of salvation, releasing positive emotions despite the competitive pressures often associated with it. Sharing perspectives and coping mechanisms enriches our collective understanding and strengthens our resolve to overcome adversities.\n\nUltimately, transforming education requires a holistic approach that balances ethical decision-making with innovative learning methods. Leveraging tools like large language models can bridge the gap between knowledge and wisdom, guiding us towards more humane and sustainable solutions. As we envision a \"GPS of knowledge,\" we must also consider the heart's role in decision-making, ensuring that our advancements lead to a more compassionate and interconnected world. By fostering environments that prioritize meaningful learning and community impact, we can prepare future generations to thrive in an increasingly complex and interdependent global society.",

      "content": "In our latest conversation, we started by discussing the setup of audio equipment and moving unused items, reflecting on the passage of time since we last spoke, possibly before the birth of a baby. I graduated in 2021 with a degree in learning sciences, focusing my research on post-traumatic growth and designing curriculums for resilience. Originally from Lebanon, I am now at the Learning Planet Institute, exploring the implications of technology, specifically large language models and AI, on learning.\n\nReferencing German poet Hölderlin's quote, \"Where the danger grows, what saves also grows,\" we delved into the global consciousness regarding dangers and the necessity to avoid self-destruction. Confucius’ quote, \"We have two lives. Your second life will start only when you know that you have only one life,\" prompted reflections on historical events like September 11, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki as moments of realization. We noted humanity's ability to self-destruct and emphasized the importance of awareness to prevent it. Despite the potential for self-destruction, we have avoided a nuclear winter so far. However, there's a critical lack of ethics in education and engineering schools, and ethical understanding seems to diminish with increased years in education. The competitive mindset and grading systems in elite universities were criticized, suggesting state schools might offer a more beneficial educational experience by focusing on being the \"best for the world\" rather than the \"best in the world.\"\n\nWe discussed the importance of intellectual and digital commons such as democracy, education, science, Wikipedia, the Internet, and open-source software. There is a need to nurture and sustain digital commons to avoid pollution and unsustainability. Recognizing the planet's carrying capacity limits population growth, we acknowledged the dynamic nature of our world due to technological advancements, environmental changes, societal shifts, and evolving ideas. The duration of competency learned in the past (30 years) versus the present (two years), especially in technological fields, possibly as low as eight months, was contrasted. Continuous learning is essential to avoid obsolescence in the job market. Even in a capitalist world, adaptation and consideration of environmental and social impacts are crucial for sustainability. Hence, redesigning learning environments, education systems, and universities to accommodate constant learning and collaboration is necessary. Learning how to learn and working with others to solve complex problems effectively and sustainably is of paramount importance.\n\nAcknowledging the stress and necessity of learning for survival, particularly highlighted during COVID-19 times, we noted the positive association of learning with the release of \"nice molecules\" in the brain, despite negative experiences in competitive educational settings. Humans are inherently good at learning, which can be a source of salvation. Personal reflections on the emotional impact of witnessing tragedy, especially after the birth of a child, emphasized the importance of maintaining hope and dreams for the future despite hardships. We inquired into coping mechanisms during difficult times and sought perspectives from others, including Phil, and invited diverse questions or comments from others, possibly a daughter, to enrich the conversation.\n\nMentioning the book \"Les Derniers Témoins\" by Svetlana Alexievich, a Nobel Prize-winning author from Belarus known for interviewing survivors of historical events, particularly women and children during World War II, we reflected on the resonance of historical traumas with current global challenges, emphasizing the likelihood of future traumas. Learning about resilience in facing and overcoming adversity is crucial. We described working with the city of Grigny, the poorest in France, to address educational challenges and foster positive change, highlighting the diversity and energy of Grigny's population despite its socio-economic struggles. Recognizing the Mayor's efforts in Grigny, who earned international recognition for his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic, we acknowledged the trauma experienced by migrants during their journeys and upon arrival in France, challenging the perception of France as a paradise.\n\nPlans to celebrate the resilience of the Refugee Olympic Team and Paralympic teams during the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris were announced. We aim to empower children from Grigny to become journalists, interviewing champions of resilience and sharing their stories, learning from these stories, and interviewing resilience champions in their own communities. Reference to StoryCorps, an organization that collects and preserves personal stories, suggested collaboration to bring their methodology to Paris. The \"Kindness First Responders\" Twitter project initiated in Iraq to promote acts of kindness in response to violence was described, highlighting a shift in perspective from solving global problems to caring for loved ones and neighbors. A personal anecdote about building connections with refugees in Lebanon emphasized the importance of humanizing individuals affected by crises.\n\nAcknowledging the increasing interdependence among individuals and with the natural world, exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, we reflected on the reciprocal nature of interdependence, where actions in one part of the world can have ripple effects elsewhere. Understanding and embracing interdependence in a chaotic and unpredictable world is crucial. Reference to chaos theory and the butterfly effect suggested that small actions can lead to significant consequences, encouraging consideration of the impact of individual actions. We explored how large language models (LLMs) can help bridge the gap by providing relevant information and guidance, akin to mentors in traditional learning environments.\n\nDefining a good mentor as someone who helps you learn to navigate the unknown and invent solutions when faced with uncertainty, we referenced Marcus Aurelius's morning routine, emphasizing the need to find resources to enact change, accept what cannot be changed, and discern between the two. Humility was highlighted as a primary virtue, particularly in times of uncertainty where assumptions about the world may limit possibilities. Humility can facilitate openness, curiosity, and wonder, leading to more sustainable and adaptable states. The Netflix series \"The Good Place\" was mentioned as a potential source for exploring virtues and ethical considerations.\n\nQuestioning whether Earth can be transformed into a paradise or if it will descend into hell, we pondered what actions can be taken to address the challenges ahead. Emphasizing responsibility and collaboration in addressing current and future challenges, recognizing that individual efforts may not be sufficient but collective action can have a significant impact, we shared an anecdote about discussing rooftop gardening with a friend in Lebanon during a time of fear and conflict, which led to a sense of joy and escape from immediate dangers. The power of feeling self-efficacious and responsible in the face of uncertainty and stress was highlighted, underscoring the joy of learning and the sense of accomplishment that comes from taking action. Voltaire's quote \"cultivate your own garden\" served as a metaphor for focusing on what one can control and finding peace and fulfillment in small, meaningful actions. Technological advancements enable individuals to connect and collaborate on a larger scale, potentially amplifying the impact of collective efforts.\n\nRecognizing humanity's collective ability to solve challenges through collaboration, facilitated by language, writing, and advancements in information and communication technologies, we proposed the concept of a \"GPS of knowledge,\" akin to a geographical positioning system but for navigating knowledge spaces. This could potentially lead to the development of similar systems for dreams and wisdom. The comparison between physical exploration (travel) and intellectual exploration (knowledge space) suggested that tools for navigating knowledge space could facilitate collaboration and problem-solving. AI assistance in navigating knowledge space was envisioned, akin to apps that facilitate connections and collaborations in physical space. T.S. Eliot's poem questioning the loss of life in living, wisdom in knowledge, and knowledge in information suggested a hierarchy from data to wisdom. Developing technology for wisdom, as current advancements primarily address data, information, and knowledge, but not wisdom, was proposed as essential for improving lives.\n\nExplaining Aristotle's three forms of knowledge: episteme (knowing how the world works/science), techne (knowing how to act on the world/technology), and phronesis (ethics of action), we discussed the importance of phronesis, or ethical consideration, in decision-making. This includes understanding the consequences of actions on oneself and others, both locally and globally, in the short and long term. The complexity of ethical decision-making was illustrated using the example of choosing between an apple and an orange at the grocery store, highlighting the need for tools to help compute the ethical consequences of actions. Recognizing the decline in compassion, cooperation, and ethical considerations in certain fields (e.g., engineering, medicine, business) as the number of years spent in schooling increases, we implicated that hyper-competitive education systems may not be fostering the human qualities necessary for the future, suggesting a need for reevaluation and potential restructuring of educational approaches.\n\nTransforming the future of universities to focus on positive impact and contribution to the commons, rather than hyper-competitive environments, was discussed. We questioned who defines positive impacts and suggested measures like quality of life years used by effective altruists. Three strategies for incorporating ethics into decision-making processes were explored: a rule-based approach (e.g., Asimov's laws for robots), which can be complex and may lead to contradictions; optimization of a single function (e.g., quality of life years or happiness), which may oversimplify complex ethical dilemmas; and imitation of the wisest person in a given situation, which is more open-ended and complex but allows for continual learning and adaptation. Confucius' belief that wisdom can be acquired through making mistakes suggested a dynamic and iterative approach to ethical decision-making.\n\nExploring the heart's epistemology and its role in decision-making and understanding, we referenced Ken Wilber's concept of the internal landscape as a laboratory for understanding the self and experiences. The contrast between external focus (e.g., quality of life years) and internal exploration (e.g., mathematics, physics, beauty, elegance) was discussed. Using LLMs to explore existing knowledge and facilitate the emergence of new ideas or insights was proposed. The concept of \"genius loci\" was reflected upon, suggesting that genius involves bringing forth something from the unseen world into the present moment through one's body and experience.\n\nProposing a redesign of universities to focus on meaningful learning and community impact rather than fitting into traditional disciplinary boxes, we envisioned co-designing a planetary university where students can learn to make a difference in their own lives, communities, and on a global scale",

Mapping needs and resources of individuals, communities, and the planet to optimize learning and collaboration was recognized as crucial. Recognizing common human needs such as care, love, and support, and the potential for meeting these needs through mutual assistance and cooperation was highlighted.\n\nEnvisioning transformative education, we proposed empowering students to shape their learning paths and contribute to collective knowledge. Redefining citizenship at a planetary scale, emphasizing interconnectedness and shared responsibility, was suggested. Fine-tuning LLMs for education to focus on critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration was emphasized. Using prompts to encourage deep engagement, ethical consideration, and innovative application, and reverse-engineering effective prompts from transformational pedagogy were recommended. Designing LLM interactions to foster curiosity, empathy, and agency in learners was also proposed.\n\nFinally, we discussed the WeLearn AI Project, trained on quality resources like IPCC reports and scientific literature on sustainability and SDGs, to provide scientifically sound answers with precise quotes to support responses. Addressing the challenge of current LLMs sometimes providing fictional or inaccurate information, the project aims to enhance reliability. Exploring the concept of a \"GPS of dreams,\" envisioning a tool to navigate and understand dreams, was also mentioned. Although current LLM responses may not directly match this concept, they offer intriguing insights, such as a song about dreaming and navigation.",
