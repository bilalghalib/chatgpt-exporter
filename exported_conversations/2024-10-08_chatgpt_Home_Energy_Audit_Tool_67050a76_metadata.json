I believe calculating the impact of the cool roof as a percentage of the total energy used and then calculating the cost by the average energy cost and subtracting it from the total is a good way. think about what we're attempting to do step by step and any issues where we can run into challenges, allow people to set cost and expected savings and return the code with a bar chart chart showing the most energy impactful appliances and a line graph showing the cost of all the investment and how the return on investment happens over time"
