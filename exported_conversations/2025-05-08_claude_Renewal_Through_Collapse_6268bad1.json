The other preferences don't seem directly applicable to this query about quotes.\n\nLet me think of some relevant quotes about how breakdown can lead to better things:\n\n1. \"The wound is the place where the Light enters you.\" - Rumi\n2. \"And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.\" - Anaïs Nin\n3. \"Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.\" - Seneca\n4. \"When things fall apart, consider the possibility that life knocked it down on purpose. Not to bully you, or to punish you, but to prompt you to build something that better suits your personality and your purpose.\" - Brianna Wiest\n5. \"What we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.\" - T.S. Eliot\n6. \"In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.\" - Albert Camus\n7. \"Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.\" - J.K. Rowling\n8. \"Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.\" - Marilyn Monroe\n9. \"The phoenix must burn to emerge.\" - Janet Fitch\n10. \"Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.\" - Kahlil Gibran\n11. \"The oak fought the wind and was broken, the willow bent when it must and survived.\" - Robert Jordan\n12. \"Where there is ruin, there is hope for a treasure.\" - Rumi\n13. \"For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction.\" - Cynthia Occelli\n14. \"When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.\" - Viktor Frankl\n15. \"Chaos is what we've lost touch with. This is why it is given a bad name. It is feared by the dominant archetype of our world, which is Ego, which clenches because its existence is defined in terms of control.\" - Terence McKenna\n16. \"The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen.\" - Elisabeth Kübler-Ross\n\nI'll provide a thoughtful collection of these quotes and add some metaphorical framing as the user seems to appreciate metaphors when figuring things out.When systems collapse, they often create space for renewal and growth. Here are some powerful quotes that capture this idea:\n\n\"The wound is the place where the Light enters you.\" - Rumi\n\n\"Where there is ruin, there is hope for a treasure.\" - Rumi\n\n\"For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone.
