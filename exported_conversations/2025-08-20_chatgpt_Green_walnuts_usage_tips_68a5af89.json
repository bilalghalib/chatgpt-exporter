I'm wondering if it's, uh, if there's something I can do with them that, you know, if I pick them now, can I cook them, can I do something, or do I just wait until they ripen?",

      "content": "Got it — you’re at the “green walnut” stage where the outer green hull is still on, but the shell inside is already starting to harden (“heart” stage). That timing really matters for what you can do:  \n\n### 1. What stage you’re at\n- **Early summer (June–early July in France):** Green walnuts are soft all the way through. You can cut them with a knife, and that’s when people make *nocino* (Italian liqueur), pickled walnuts (British), or sweet preserves (Greek “glyko karydaki”).  \n- **Late summer (August 20 where you are):** The shell is already forming inside. That means you can’t use them for the “whole walnut” recipes — they’ll be too hard and bitter for preserves or pickling. At this point, they’re basically on their way to being mature walnuts.\n\n### 2. What you can do with them now\n- **Harvest the outer green hull** (the fleshy green part) before it blackens:  \n  - Used to make natural *ink* or *dye* (a very deep brown/black stain).  \n  - Traditionally used in hair dye and textile dyeing.  \n  - Also used in some herbal tinctures (though caution: it’s strong, and not something to just eat casually).  \n- **Don’t try to cook them like food now** — the nutmeat inside isn’t mature, and the shell makes it unpleasant.  \n\n### 3. If you wait\n- By late September/October, the hull will split and the mature walnuts will drop. That’s when you can collect proper nuts to eat, dry, or press for oil.\n\n✅ **So:** At this stage (August 20 in northern France), your options are mainly *non-culinary*: making dye/ink, or perhaps a tincture. If you want edible uses (pickles, liqueur, preserves), you’d need to wait for next year’s June harvest when they’re still completely soft. If you want walnuts to eat, leave them until autumn when they ripen naturally.  \n\nWould you like me to give you a recipe for a **green walnut dye/ink** (traditional way to use them right now), or would you prefer ideas for **harvesting next year at the right time for food**?",
