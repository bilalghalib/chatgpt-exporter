      "content": "**Integrating Polyvagal Theory with Post-Traumatic Growth: A Unified Framework**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nPost-Traumatic Growth (PTG) refers to the positive psychological changes experienced as a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances. Polyvagal Theory, developed by Dr. Stephen Porges, offers a neurophysiological framework for understanding how individuals respond to stress and trauma. By integrating PTG literature, resilience research, and Polyvagal Theory, we can develop a unified framework that informs pedagogical strategies aimed at promoting PTG through training programs.\n\n**Unified Framework**\n\nThe unified framework revolves around the interaction between the autonomic nervous system (as explained by Polyvagal Theory) and psychological factors that contribute to PTG. The key components include:\n\n1. **Autonomic Regulation**: Understanding how the autonomic nervous system (ANS) responds to stress and trauma, and how it can be regulated to promote safety and social engagement.\n\n2. **Cognitive Processing**: Facilitating deliberate rumination and the construction of new narratives to make sense of traumatic experiences.\n\n3. **Psychosocial Resources**: Leveraging social support, gratitude, self-efficacy, and optimistic outlooks to foster resilience and growth.\n\n4. **Coping Styles**: Encouraging acceptance and positive reinterpretation as adaptive coping mechanisms.\n\n5. **Identity and Self-Concept**: Developing a coherent narrative and a strong sense of self to integrate traumatic experiences into one's life story.\n\n**Diagram 1: The Polyvagal-Informed PTG Model**\n\n*Description*: This diagram illustrates the interaction between the autonomic nervous system states and the psychological processes leading to PTG.\n\n- **Ventral Vagal State (Safety and Social Engagement)**:\n  - **Facilitates**: Open communication, social support, gratitude, and deliberate rumination.\n  - **Leads to**: Enhanced self-efficacy and optimistic outlook.\n\n- **Sympathetic Activation (Fight or Flight)**:\n  - **Challenges**: Increases stress but can be channeled into active coping strategies.\n  - **Opportunity**: Mobilizes energy for confronting and processing trauma.\n\n- **Dorsal Vagal State (Shutdown/Freeze)**:\n  - **Risks**: Inhibits processing and integration of traumatic experiences.\n  - **Interventions**: Techniques to decrease stress and re-engage the ventral vagal state.\n\n**Diagram 2: The Cycle of Post-Traumatic Growth**\n\n*Description*: This diagram presents a cyclical process highlighting the stages from trauma to growth.\n\n1. **Traumatic Event**:\n   - Disruption of core beliefs and worldview.\n\n2. **Emotional Distress**:\n   - Autonomic responses (Polyvagal Theory states).\n\n3. **Deliberate Rumination**:\n   - Cognitive processing to make sense of the trauma.\n\n4. **Constructing a New Narrative**:\n   - Developing a coherent story that integrates the traumatic experience.\n\n5. **Psychosocial Support and Coping**:\n   - Utilizing social networks and adaptive coping styles.\n\n6. **Post-Traumatic Growth Outcomes**:\n   - New possibilities, deeper relationships, appreciation for life, personal strength, spiritual development.\n\n**Diagram 3: Designing Pedagogies for PTG**\n\n*Description*: This diagram outlines how training programs can incorporate elements that promote PTG.\n\n- **Curriculum Components**:\n  - **Stress Reduction Techniques**: Mindfulness, breathing exercises (engage ventral vagal state).\n  - **Competence Building**: Skill development to increase self-efficacy.\n  - **Narrative Construction**: Activities that encourage sharing and reframing experiences.\n  - **Social Support Structures**: Group work, peer mentoring.\n\n- **Learning Environment**:\n  - **Safety and Inclusivity**: Creating a space that fosters the ventral vagal state.\n  - **Empowerment**: Encouraging autonomy and perception of control.\n\n- **Assessment and Reflection**:\n  - **Deliberate Rumination**: Journaling, discussion forums.\n  - **Positive Reinterpretation**: Feedback that highlights growth and learning.\n\n**Application in Pedagogical Design**\n\nBy integrating the unified framework into training programs, educators can:\n\n- **Reduce Stress**: Implement practices that help regulate the ANS, preventing the freeze response and promoting engagement.\n\n- **Increase Competence**: Design activities that build skills and confidence, enhancing self-efficacy.\n\n- **Facilitate Narrative Construction**: Encourage learners to share and reframe their experiences, fostering a coherent sense of self.\n\n- **Enhance Social Support**: Create collaborative learning environments that promote connection and mutual support.\n\n- **Promote Adaptive Coping**: Teach and model acceptance and positive reinterpretation strategies.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy viewing PTG through the lens of Polyvagal Theory, we can understand the physiological underpinnings of trauma responses and leverage this knowledge to design effective pedagogies. The integration of autonomic regulation, cognitive processing, psychosocial resources, adaptive coping, and identity formation provides a comprehensive approach to fostering post-traumatic growth in educational settings.\n\n**Visualizing the Unified Theory**\n\nThe diagrams serve as visual tools to understand and communicate the complex interactions between physiological states and psychological processes. They help educators and practitioners conceptualize how to structure programs that not only transfer knowledge but also promote healing and growth.",

While suffering and trauma are undeniably painful, Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) offers a silver lining, a potential to emerge from the darkest moments stronger, wiser, and more resilient. This transformative process invites individuals to look beyond their wounds and seek the potential for personal growth. By embracing the idea of PTG, individuals can find solace in knowing that their struggles can have meaning and purpose, which may ultimately lead to a richer, more meaningful life.\n\nPTG is mostly a natural process that happens to some individuals after going through traumatic experiences, but it can also be facilitated, as demonstrated by the pioneering work of the renowned psychologists Richard Tedeschi, PhD, and Lawrence Calhoun, PhD.\n\nWe’ll explore a facilitator’s way of relating called expert companionship, a theoretical model of PTG and how it is different from resilience, the right time for introduction of PTG, and the five elements of facilitation that can help individuals rebuild their lives after experiencing trauma. Practitioners will find the series of infographics invaluable as useful reference in understanding and applying the principles of facilitating PTG. These visual aids, adapted from Tedeschi’s presentations, distill complex concepts into easily digestible formats, providing a quick reference guide for those working in the field.\n\nRemember, trauma may be a part of life, but it doesn’t have to define it. With the right tools and understanding, we can facilitate post-traumatic growth and help individuals emerge stronger than before.\n\nThis blog post uses the terms “facilitator” and “practitioners” interchangeably to refer to professionals such as health-care providers, clinicians, researchers, therapists or counselors, who are actively engaged in working with patients, clients or research participants to facilitate post-traumatic growth after a traumatic life experience. These terms are used inclusively to encompass a wide range of individuals who play a role in helping others on their post-traumatic growth journeys.\n\nThe PTG theory describes the interpersonal, dramatic growth following a single or ongoing series of traumatic events. The term client refers to individuals who may be under professional care for mental health recovery, physical recovery or rehabilitation post physical recovery. These individuals may have experienced any of the wide variety of traumatic events including through combat, domestic abuse, natural disasters, accidents, psychological abuse, serious illness such as cancer, bereavement and sexual assault or any event that may have been viewed as traumatic from the individuals’ unique position. They may or may not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD or Complex PTSD.\n\nWhat is the process of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) and how does it differ from Resilience?\n\nResilience and Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) are two distinct responses to traumatic events. Resilience refers to an individual’s ability to withstand or recover from traumatic events without experiencing significant disruption to their psychological well-being. It’s about bouncing back from adversity especially when the individual’s assumptive world beliefs are robust enough and help to provide context for the trauma. On the other hand, PTG is a transformative response to trauma, where individuals not only recover but experience personal growth as a result of the trauma. PTG involves a deep psychological shift, often occurring after an individual’s core beliefs and assumptions about the world are challenged or shattered and the individual struggles to cope up and suffers after the trauma. Therefore, not the trauma, but the ensuing struggle and suffering are essential catalysts for PTG.\n\n\nTheoretical Model of Post Traumatic Growth Adapted from Calhoun & Tedeschi’s\n\nTedeschi and Calahn have developed a theoretical model to help describe the process of PTG, while incorporating person variables and environment influences and the primary medium is cognitive processing of the shattered assumptive word. In the above theoretical model adapted from the original, we’ve depicted two paths: a Resilience path and a PTG path. The Resilience path suggests that individuals rely on pre-existing adaptive core beliefs to navigate traumatic events and recover more readily. In contrast, the PTG path indicates that individuals face significant emotional distress as their core beliefs are challenged, leading initially to intrusive thinking and brooding kind of rumination and later shifting towards deliberate reflection once the emotional regulation is mitigated through appropriate interventions. This reflection leads to a shift in the schema and developing a new narrative for their lives, which eventually can lead to growth, where they find greater meaning, purpose and wisdom.\n\nThe cognitive processing and emotional distress in both paths are interrelated, with one influencing the other. PTG process primarily happens from non-intrusive rumination or reflective thinking, ultimately helping individuals move from the turmoil of trauma to a more meaningful and evolved perspective on life. This process is distinct from resilience, where recovery and adaptation are much sooner and therefore little scope for transformation.\n\nInterventions for emotional regulation and socio-cultural factors are crucial in shifting from negative rumination to reflective rumination. Emotional regulation techniques, like therapy or physical and mindfulness practices, help individuals manage trauma-related emotions, creating a foundation for constructive thinking. Socio-cultural support networks, inspirational role models and narratives provide validation, fostering open conversations. These interventions empower individuals to move from intrusive negativity to reflective growth-oriented thinking.\n\nWhile resilience and PTG are distinct concepts, there exists a dynamic relationship between them. Resilience pertains to the ability to recover swiftly from trauma or withstand its impact, whereas PTG signifies the transformative response that emerges from deeply experiencing trauma. In the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event, resilience and PTG may appear inversely related, as resilience reflects one’s capacity to bounce back without undergoing profound change. However, over time, the process of post-traumatic growth can lead individuals to live their lives differently, ultimately rendering them more resilient in the face of future traumas.\n\nUnderstanding Post-Traumatic Growth: What It Is and What It Isn’t\n\nWhen discussing post-traumatic growth (PTG) with clients, practitioners aim to provide a clear and empathetic understanding of this concept. PTG represents the positive psychological changes that individuals can experience in the aftermath of a traumatic event. PTG is a recognition of the strength and resilience that can emerge from adversity. It doesn’t mean that the trauma itself was positive, but rather, it acknowledges the potential for personal growth and positive changes in the aftermath. It’s essential to clarify what PTG is and address some common myths surrounding it.\n\n\nWhat is Post-Traumatic Growth (Outcome & Process) and What It Isn’t (Myths)?\n\nWhat is Post-Traumatic Growth as an Outcome?\n\nThe concept of post-traumatic growth (PTG) as an outcome encompasses five distinct domains, each representing a unique facet of personal transformation as described in this visual.\n\n\nSummary of the Five Domains of Post-Traumatic Growth\n\nPTG as an Outcome Involves:\n\nNew Perspectives: PTG often leads to a shift in how individuals view themselves, others, and the world.\nIncreased Resilience: Increased wisdom and emotional regulation capacity enhances one’s ability to cope with stress and future adversity.\nDeeper Relationships: PTG may foster closer connections and a greater appreciation for social support.\nRediscovery of Meaning: It often involves finding a renewed sense of purpose or meaning in life.\nPersonal Strength: PTG can result in increased self-confidence and a sense of personal empowerment.\nPTG involves a significant positive shift in the mindset of survivors between the immediate aftermath of traumatic experiences to a later stage when growth in experienced. The below visual shows that shift in terms of hypothetical testimonials corresponding to each of the five domains of PTG. This shift in mindset after experiencing growth often transcends the mindset of the individual before the adversities.\n\n\nAn Inspiring Poster Demonstrating the Potential for a Greater Shift in Mindset in each of the Five Domains of Post-Traumatic Growth\n\nWhat is Post-Traumatic Growth as a Process?\n\nPTG as a process involves a natural cognitive processing as described in the theoretical model and this process can be successfully facilitated through guidance and interventions from practitioners.\n\nPTG as a Process Involves:\n\nReflective Rumination: PTG starts with natural reflective rumination, leading to the reevaluation of core beliefs after trauma.\nTrauma Recovery: It’s closely tied to emotional regulation and the transition from intrusive to reflective thinking during trauma recovery.\nRelational Healing: PTG involves healing through open self-disclosure and support from others.\nSuffering and Struggle: Growth emerges from adversity, emphasizing the potential for positive change amid challenges.\nReframing the Narrative: PTG is about reshaping one’s story after traumatic life experiences, finding meaning, and using it to help others with compassion and increased wisdom.\nWhat Post-Traumatic Growth Isn’t (Common Myths)?\n\nPractitioners play an important role in clarifying misconceptions and setting up a realistic stage for PTG as an aid for their recovery process involving a significant potential upside.\n\nPTG Does Not Involve:\n\nInstant Recovery: PTG is not resilience or a quick fix; it’s a gradual process, and there’s no specific timeframe for achieving it.\nUniform Experience: Not everyone who experiences trauma will undergo PTG, and it doesn’t happen in the same way for everyone.\nClosure: PTG doesn’t mean that the pain, distress or memories of the trauma disappear entirely; it’s about learning to live with them differently. PTG does not equate to happiness.\nDetachment: People can maintain connections with those they’ve lost or experienced trauma with, and this doesn’t hinder PTG.\nOne-Size-Fits-All: PTG doesn’t require everyone to talk about their trauma; there are various ways to process and express it.\nIn his book “A Whole New Life”, Reynolds Price has captured the essence of what PTG is through his quote, “[Trauma forces a person] to be somebody else, the next viable you–a stripped-down whole other clear-eyed person, realistic as a sawed-off shotgun and thankful for air, not to speak of the human kindness you’ll meet if you get normal luck.” In essence, Price’s quote beautifully portrays PTG’s transformative nature, gratitude & clarity as outcomes and the key role of human connections to support the process of PTG.\n\n\nUnderstanding the role of suffering as a catalyst for PTG\n\nPost-Traumatic Growth (PTG) encompassing both the “process” and the “outcome” of positive changes that can occur within an individual. The process of PTG, revolves around the idea of the individual enduring suffering and grappling with traumatic events that can lead to a profound shift. This notion underscores the crucial role of struggle, especially coping with the psychological stress and dysfunction, in the process of reconstruction following trauma.\n\nTo fully go through this transformation, one has to naturally or with support from a facilitator take the difficult path of questioning pre-existing beliefs, jettisoning or revising core belief systems, and ultimately arriving at a new worldview that aligns with their lived experiences. This journey of post-traumatic growth is not a simple one; it involves introspection, cognitive reassessment, and the cultivation of new possibilities, as well as an enhanced appreciation for life, deeper connections with others, and spiritual or existential development. These five areas of growth are intricately linked to the inherent struggle with trauma, highlighting the importance of suffering as a catalyst for transformative change.\n\nIn essence, suffering and the subsequent struggle serve as the foundation upon which the edifice of post-traumatic growth is constructed.\n\nit is essential to acknowledge, as Tedeschi has consistently emphasized, that while the focus on the possibilities for transformation of individuals and their relationships through suffering and Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) does not preclude addressing the typical symptoms of trauma, it underscores the idea that symptoms are better understood, tolerated, and effectively reduced when the experience of traumatic suffering is imbued with meaning and purpose. In other words, PTG complements the conventional approach to trauma recovery by helping individuals navigate their symptoms with a more profound sense of longer-term purpose and resilience.\n\nExpert Companionship Model\n\nThe Expert Companionship Model, developed by Tedeschi and Calhoun, is a vital framework for understanding and fostering post-traumatic growth (PTG) in trauma survivors. This approach underscores the significance of an expert companion in facilitating PTG by guiding individuals through the intricate processes of transformation following traumatic experiences.\n\nThis approach to practice takes into account a comprehensive perspective on trauma, encompassing various experiences that might not align with conventional diagnostic definitions. These experiences are deemed traumatic as they profoundly disrupt individuals’ fundamental beliefs about themselves, others, the future, and the nature of our world.\n\n\nExpert Companionship – Different Roles Played by a Post Traumatic Growth Facilitator\n\nPractitioner’s Role\n\nCollaborative Partnership: Expert companionship involves practitioners working closely and collaboratively with individuals who have experienced trauma. Practitioners serve as partners in the survivor’s journey.\nSupportive Role: Practitioners take on a supportive and guiding role rather than a purely authoritative one, fostering a sense of partnership. They offer support to help mitigate emotional distress and guidance to enable self-disclosure in an emotionally safe environment.\nEmpowerment: Expert companionship aims to empower individuals to take an active role in their healing and growth process. Practitioners empower survivors to make choices about their recovery.\nPractitioner’s Behavior Approach\n\nActive Listening: Practitioners actively listen to the experiences, thoughts, and emotions of trauma survivors, providing a safe and empathetic space for them to share. This involves being a good listener.\nHumanity and Compassion: Practitioners demonstrate humanity and compassion, ensuring survivors see them as empathetic and understanding human beings.\nValidation: They validate the survivor’s feelings and experiences, acknowledging the impact of trauma on their lives. Practitioners acknowledge the survivor’s emotions.\nDownplaying Expertise: Practitioners downplay their expertise, recognizing that survivors are experts on their own experiences.\n Addressing Myths and Perceptions\n\nTolerating Craziness: Practitioners show tolerance for what survivors might perceive as “craziness” in their experiences, offering understanding and acceptance.\nNo Time Limit: The idea that there is no time limit for overcoming trauma is emphasized, allowing survivors to heal at their own pace.\nAlternatives to Talk: Practitioners explore alternative ways of expressing trauma beyond talking, recognizing that different activities may be more effective for some survivors.\nCultural Consideration: Cultural differences and understandings of trauma and growth are considered to provide culturally sensitive support.\nPace, Length and Support\n\nRespect for Autonomy: Expert companionship respects the autonomy and choices of survivors, allowing them to drive the pace and direction of their growth. Survivor autonomy is prioritized.\nLong-Term Support: The process of expert companionship may extend over time, offering continuous support and guidance as individuals navigate their post-trauma journey. Practitioners commit to long-term support, recognizing that growth is a gradual process.\nBeing a Learner: Practitioners adopt a stance of being a learner rather than an expert, acknowledging that each survivor’s experience is unique.\n Approach to PTG\n\nFocus on Growth: Practitioners highlight the potential for post-traumatic growth, emphasizing that healing involves not just overcoming but also growing from the experience.\nExploration of Assumptive World Beliefs: Practitioners assist in exploring and challenging assumptive world beliefs, helping individuals reevaluate and adapt their core beliefs. This involves helping survivors make sense of their experiences.\nPromoting Reflection: They encourage reflection on how trauma has affected various domains of life, such as personal strengths, relationships, and values. Reflection is encouraged to gain insights.\nFacilitation of Narrative: Practitioners help survivors construct a coherent narrative of their trauma experiences, guiding them in making sense of their journey. They assist in creating a meaningful story.\nGoal Setting: Together with survivors, they set achievable goals for post-traumatic growth and work on strategies to reach these goals. Goal setting is a collaborative process to foster growth.\nCultivation of Resilience: Practitioners help survivors develop resilience by focusing on strengths and coping mechanisms. Resilience is nurtured as survivors learn to cope.\nTraumatic experiences often involve a significant and immediate fear response as individuals perceive a direct threat to their physical or emotional well-being. Trauma survivors who receive love, understanding, and support can experience a shift in their relationship with fear, ultimately contributing to their growth and recovery. The quote “Fear knocked at the door. Love answered and no one was there.’ by Wayne Dyer helps reinforce the idea that love in the form of trust, understanding, compassion and empathy can be a transformative force in the journey of posttraumatic growth. Love has the incredible power to dissolve and dissipate fear. Love serves as the uniting force that binds us together and reveals our deepest humanity. For practitioners dedicated to supporting PTG, the primary contribution that defines their role as ‘expert companions’ to their patients or clients is a profound love for the human condition and being genuinely invested in the healing and growth of another human being.\n\n\nWhen should practitioners introduce the concept of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)?\n\nThe timing for introducing the concept of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) to clients should be considered carefully. Here are some key considerations for practitioners:\n\n\nPractitioner’s Readiness Checklist for Introduction of Post-Traumatic Growth Discussions\n\nAssessment of Readiness: Before introducing the concept of PTG, practitioners should assess the individual’s readiness. It’s important to gauge whether the person has reached a stage in their healing process where they are open to exploring the idea of growth and positive change following trauma. This can vary greatly from person to person.\nStability and Safety: Ensure that the individual is in a stable and safe emotional and psychological state. PTG discussions may not be appropriate during the acute phase of trauma or when the person is still struggling with severe distress, as their immediate focus may be on coping and recovery.\nEstablishing Trust: Building a trusting therapeutic relationship is crucial. Patients are more likely to engage with the concept of PTG if they trust their practitioner. Take the time to establish trust and rapport before broaching the topic.\nTiming within Therapy: Introducing PTG is often more appropriate in the later stages of therapy or counseling. After addressing immediate trauma-related symptoms and providing emotional support, practitioners can gradually introduce the idea of growth as part of the healing journey.\nIndividualized Approach: Recognize that every person’s healing process is unique. Some individuals may be receptive to the idea of PTG early on, while others may need more time. Tailor your approach based on the individual’s specific needs and progress.\nAssessing Resilience: Consider assessing the individual’s existing resilience and coping resources. Those with a stronger foundation of resilience may be more open to discussions about growth, whereas others may need additional support in developing these resources.\nUse of Positive Language: When introducing PTG, use positive and hopeful language. Emphasize that growth is possible, but don’t downplay the individual’s current struggles or distress.\nOffering a Choice: Present the concept of PTG as an option rather than an expectation. Allow the individual to decide whether they want to explore this aspect of their healing journey.\nEducation and Psychoeducation: Begin by providing psychoeducation about trauma and its impact. As the individual gains a better understanding of their experiences, it may naturally lead to discussions about growth and resilience.\nOngoing Assessment: Continuously assess the individual’s receptiveness to PTG throughout the therapeutic process. Be prepared to revisit the concept at different stages of treatment as their readiness and needs evolve.\nUltimately, the introduction of PTG should be a collaborative and patient-centered process. It’s essential to prioritize the individual’s well-being, comfort, and readiness when discussing the potential for growth after trauma.\n\nThe Five Elements of Facilitating Post-Traumatic Growth\n\nFacilitating post-traumatic growth (PTG) is a multifaceted process, guided by the expert companion, often a practitioner versed in the principles of the expert companionship model introduced by Tedeschi and Calhoun. Grounded in the theoretical model of PTG, which delves into the aftermath of trauma, this approach primarily focuses on enabling cognitive processing of the shattered assumptive world. The expert companion navigates five pivotal elements to facilitate PTG, each playing a unique role in this transformative journey. These elements include psychoeducation, emotional regulation, constructive self-disclosure, narrative development, and service & resilient life principles. By understanding and effectively applying these elements, practitioners can help individuals navigate the tumultuous waters of trauma towards growth, resilience, and a deeper appreciation for life.\n\n\n5 Elements of Facilitating Post-Traumatic Growth\n\n1. Psychoeducation: Understanding Trauma, PTG Potential, and the Truth\n\nPsychoeducation serves as the cornerstone of PTG facilitation. In the early stages, practitioners help individuals understand and navigate trauma by addressing the ‘what,’ ‘how,’ ‘why,’ and “what next” of the traumatic experience. It’s vital to explain that psychological reactions to trauma do not reflect personal flaws but are common responses.\n\nThis understanding sets the stage for exploring the potential for PTG. Practitioner will assess the readiness of the Indvidual to be introduced to the concept of PTG and this can vary widely between each individual.\n\nTrauma is framed as a disruption of core beliefs and the assumptive world, highlighting that the struggle with coping and suffering can catalyze personal growth. Practitioners clarify any myths or negative perceptions around trauma and PTG, providing clarification to facts like how PTG is distinct from removing distress or unhappiness, emphasizing its unique transformative nature.\n\n2. Emotional Regulation: Mitigating Intrusive Thinking and Shifting to Reflective Thinking\n\nAs seen in the theoretical model of PTG, emotional regulation is crucial in navigating the journey towards PTG. Practitioners assist individuals in mitigating intrusive thinking by enabling the management of dysregulated sympathetic nervous system responses, which control automatic, intrusive thoughts. Practitioners use therapy and techniques such as cognitive restructuring redirect negative thoughts (anxiety, guilt, anger) towards positivity. Additionally, practitioners introduce emotion regulation practices, such as exercise, mindfulness, and breathing, into daily routines. These practices help individuals create a safety plan, identify triggers, set boundaries, and employ calming strategies.\n\nBy mitigating intrusive thinking and encouraging reflective rumination, individuals can shift their focus from brooding to thoughtful reflection, reassessing core beliefs about themselves, the world, and life.\n\n\nCognitive Reassessment – Sample reflective thinking questions that challenge the Assumptive World\n\n3. Constructive Self-Disclosure: Creating an Emotionally Safe Environment and Sharing Struggles\n\nConstructive self-disclosure revolves around creating an emotionally safe environment for individuals to open up and share their thoughts and feelings. Expert companions encourage the cultivation of authentic, non-judgmental, and secure spaces for communication within healing relationships.\n\nThis element involves sharing personal struggles constructively, steering the narrative of trauma towards the present state and the experience of the aftermath. It encourages individuals to explore how trauma represents a life transition and prompts questions like, “How did trauma change you?” and “Who were you before, and who are you now?” Furthermore, it empowers individuals to provide and receive support, nurturing bonds with supportive individuals for mutual growth through shared experiences.\n\n4. Narrative Development: Crafting a Coherent Narrative, organizing around the Five Domains, and Embracing Paradoxes\n\nNarrative development plays a pivotal role in the PTG journey. Expert companions encourage individuals to craft a coherent narrative by drawing inspiration from stories of resilience through adversity. This process involves enabling self-discovery by structuring the trauma story with the traumatic event as a turning point. Individuals are guided to develop narratives that span the five domains of PTG – Personal Strength, Closer Relationships, Greater Appreciation for Life, New Possibilities, and Spiritual Development. Additionally, practitioners inspire an appreciation for paradoxes, emphasizing examples like how strength can emerge from accepting support and control can be found in seemingly uncontrollable situations.\n\n\nNarrative Development – Sample questions to help orient the story around the 5 Domain of Post Traumatic Growth\n\n\nTestimonials – Hypothetical samples that represent what individuals might share after experiencing Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) in each of the 5 Domains of Post Traumatic Growth\n\n5. Service & Resilient Principles: Finding Ways to Serve, Developing Sustainable Life Principles, and Embracing the Hero’s Journey\n\nThe final element in facilitating PTG involves encouraging individuals to find ways to serve, whether through small acts of kindness or contributions to communities and causes. This fosters a sense of fulfillment and belonging.\n\nExpert companions recommend the development of robust life principles that guide individuals even in the face of adversity. This includes embracing the identity of a trauma survivor and evolving into a compassionate and wise individual. Practitioners help individuals accept personal growth as a means of making a meaningful impact on the lives of others, alluding to the hero’s journey where individuals view themselves as altruistic heroes in their resilience journey, expressing real truths about life in the everyday world after learning to survive extraordinary events.\n\nIn conclusion, facilitating PTG is a profound process guided by expert companions who skillfully navigate these five essential elements. By enabling cognitive processing of the shattered assumptive world and drawing from the expert companionship model and theoretical model of PTG, practitioners empower individuals to transform trauma into an opportunity for growth, resilience, and a renewed appreciation for life.\n\nMeasuring Client’s Post-Traumatic Growth and Progress using the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI)\n\nAlthough personal growth and change are often subjective, practitioners can help their clients measure and track their positive transformation with the help of a valuable self-report tool called Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). This kind of quantitative measure can be very helpful, to provides direction to the clients about their future actions and suggest scope for improvement.\n\nThe PTGI is readily available online and serves as a reliable resource for evaluating personal growth in the aftermath of traumatic experiences. PTGI has consistently demonstrated its reliability in assessing genuine growth following trauma and can be adapted for clients going through various scenarios like life-threatening illnesses, accidents or during transitional life events such as childbirth, bereavement, and divorce.\n\nRecommended PTGI Usage and Frequency:\n\nTrauma practitioners can utilize the PTGI to assist clients in identifying their strengths, weaknesses, and growth areas. It’s recommended to have clients complete the inventory at least twice, spaced a few months apart. This approach allows practitioners to establish a baseline for assessing growth accurately and tailor treatment plans to encourage progress in all areas.\n\nStructure of PTGI:\n\nThe PTGI comprises 21 questions or items, each rated on a Likert scale from 0 to 5. These questions fall into one of the five domains of posttraumatic growth also called factors: I. New possibilities, II. Relating to others, III. Personal strength, IV. Spiritual change, and V. Appreciation of life. The questions are designed to focus essentially on permanent changes and so prevent temporary changes from affecting overall scores.\n\nGuidelines for Client Self-Reporting:\n\nIt’s important to consider potential variations in memory recollections between two self-reports over a period of time and so working with practitioners is considered as a better option as compared to using the tool independently by individuals. In sessions, clients can easily mark their scores or tick the boxes to indicate the degree of change they’ve experienced due to their crises. Note that questions to which factors belong are intentionally not listed on the form administered to clients to minimize any potentially bias while responding to the questions.\n\n\nClient’s Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) Tool Developed by Tedeschi and Calhoun (LINK TO CAREINNOVATIONS.ORG)\n\nScoring Guidelines for Practitioners:\n\nSumming the scores gauges the level of post-traumatic growth and provides insights into the areas of self-development that have thrived and those that may require more attention. While clients do not see the questions categorized within specific groupings, practitioners can obtain scores for each of the five categories. This enables pinpointing areas of growth and opportunities for further positive change in clients’ lives.\n\nEnhanced Worksheets for Practitioner:\n\nIn order to simplify scoring and progress tracking, we have introduced two user-friendly aids for trauma practitioners. These worksheets incorporate color-coded Likert scale, organize scores neatly in a single column, provide a visual guide for tallying scores within individual growth factors, and provide comparison with a baseline assessment. These enhancements streamline the practitioner’s workflow, enabling them to focus more on facilitating clients’ posttraumatic growth journeys. It’s important to note that these worksheets are designed with practitioners’ convenience in mind and are meant to complement, not replace, the administration of the original PTGI tool to clients. They are compatible with the basic 21-item PTGI.

It relies on self-reporting, which may not capture all negative experiences associated with trauma. Furthermore, the growth measured may not be solely attributed to trauma, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. Additionally, the PTGI lacks precise definitions of terms like trauma, crisis, and highly stressful events, potentially leading to perceptions of illusory growth. Trauma practitioners need to consider these limitations while using this valuable tool.\n\nWhat traits make some individuals more predisposed to Post-Traumatic Growth?\n\n\nWhen delving into the factors that make certain individuals more predisposed to the experience of Posttraumatic Growth (PTG), practitioners should view this exploration not as a limitation but as a powerful opportunity. Understanding these factors enables practitioners to play a pivotal role in guiding and encouraging their clients along the path of PTG. By harnessing this knowledge, practitioners can empower clients to cultivate behaviors and attitudes that facilitate growth through fostering safe connections for self-disclosure, positive reflective thinking, and newfound purpose as they develop their narrative.\n\n\nThe predisposition to experience Posttraumatic Growth (PTG) is a complex phenomenon, influenced by several factors. Dr.  Tedeschi, avoids prescribing a definitive percentage of individuals who undergo PTG but suggests that it may encompass a substantial portion, ranging from one-half to two-thirds, depending on various variables. These factors encompass the nature of the traumatic event, the specific circumstances surrounding it, the timing of PTG assessment, and the approach used for interpretation of growth using tools like the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI).\n\nCertain personality traits, including openness and extroversion, and a life-orientation factor of optimism emerge as influential factors for responding positively to PTG.  Demographically, while the difference is relatively small, women tend to report more growth than men and also late adolescents and young adults exhibit greater openness to PTG.\n\nFurthermore, socio-cultural factors, both proximate and distal, have a substantial influence. Proximate factors, which include immediate surroundings, such as family, friends, and community support, role models, can either bolster or impede PTG.  Distal factors, encompassing broader cultural and societal norms, values, and beliefs, also shape the PTG experience. Cultural narratives and expectations regarding resilience and recovery following trauma play a role in determining the path of an individual’s posttraumatic growth journey.\n\nHere are additional details from the research of Tedeschi and Calhoun, about how the traits of life orientation, personality and demographics make some individuals more predisposed to one or more domains of PTG.\n\n\nTrait favorable for Post-Traumatic Growth\n\nLife Orientation Factors\n\nOptimism: Optimists excel in focusing their attention and resources on crucial matters while adeptly disengaging from uncontrollable or unsolvable problems. Individuals who harbor confidence in their goals, expect favorable outcomes, and maintain hope in overcoming adversity are more predisposed to PTG. Optimistic individuals exhibit a predisposition to experience growth across all five domains of PTG.\n\nThis quality becomes particularly advantageous during the “Narrative Development” element of the facilitation process as the individuals explore new possibilities and purpose.\n\nBig Five Personality Traits\n\n1. Openness:  Individuals characterized by high levels of openness tend to be curious, open to new experiences, and emotionally responsive. They are inclined to reevaluate their belief systems and adjust their worldviews in the wake of trauma. Those who embrace imagination, experimentation, and independence are more likely to embark on a journey of posttraumatic growth. Open individuals particularly tend to experience growth in the “Personal Strength” and “New Possibilities” domains of PTG.\n\nThis quality becomes particularly advantageous during the “Shift to deliberate and reflective rumination” within the “Emotional Regulation” element of the facilitation process.\n\n2. Conscientiousness: Conscientious individuals exhibit a knack for self-regulating their internal experiences, mastering impulse control, and excelling in problem-solving and cognitive restructuring. Their organized, careful, and disciplined approach to life predisposes them to PTG, whereas those leaning towards disorganization, carelessness, and impulsivity may face additional hurdles in their growth journey. Conscientious individuals are particularly poised to experience growth within the “Personal Strength” domain of PTG.\n\n3. Agreeableness: Agreeable individuals are characterized by their propensity to seek support when needed and their willingness to provide it to others. Their soft-hearted, trusting, and helpful nature predisposes them to PTG. Agreeable individuals predominantly experience growth in the “Closer Relationships” domain of PTG.\n\nThis quality aligns well with the “Constructive Self-Disclosure” element of facilitation, as agreeable individuals are more likely to open up and share their struggles and emotions with their support network.\n\n4. Extroversion:   Extroverted individuals exhibit a proclivity for adopting problem-solving strategies, cognitive restructuring, and seeking support and connections from others. Their sociable, fun-loving, and affectionate demeanor enhances their predisposition to PTG.  Extroverted individuals display a predisposition to experience growth across all five domains of PTG.\n\nThis quality aligns well with the “Constructive Self-Disclosure” element of facilitation, as extroverts are more likely to share their experiences and emotions with their support network.\n\nDemographic Factors\n\nGender:  Thought this factor is understudied, it is noted that women, in general, tend to be relatively more predisposed to PTG compared to men. The nature of this predisposition may vary depending on the type of trauma experienced. Women may rely more on spiritual and relational changes as coping mechanisms and therefore exhibit a predisposition to experience growth primarily in the “Closer Relationships” and “Spiritual Development” domains of PTG.\n\nAge: Age can be a factor as well, with children under the age of 8 being less likely to possess the cognitive capacity to experience PTG fully. Conversely, late adolescents and young adults, who are often in the process of constructing their worldviews, exhibit greater openness to the kind of transformative change that PTG represents.\n\nIn practice, it’s important for practitioners to recognize that while certain groups, such as extroverts, women, and optimists, may naturally exhibit a predisposition to PTG, they can also play a pivotal role in guiding others to acquire and adopt key aspects of these traits. By encouraging individuals to cultivate selective aspects of optimism, conscientiousness, and extroversion, practitioners can empower them to develop secure connections for self-disclosure, engage in meaningful positive reflective thinking, and embark on a journey of narrative development to find new purpose. Through thoughtful guidance and support, individuals from all backgrounds can harness these skills, fostering their own posttraumatic growth and transformation.\n\n\nCaveats of Post-Traumatic Growth\n\nWhen practitioners are working with Posttraumatic Growth (PTG) in their practice, it’s essential to bear in mind these important reminders outlined by Tedeschi and Calhoun:\n\nPTG emerges amidst suffering and psychological turmoil. Practitioners must always maintain empathy for the pain and struggle experienced by trauma survivors, ensuring that the focus on growth doesn’t inadvertently overshadow their client’s distress.\nIt’s crucial to understand that trauma is not a prerequisite for personal development. Individuals can still mature and evolve in meaningful ways without experiencing traumatic events.\nPractitioners must always uphold the idea of trauma as inherently undesirable and painful. It is not something to be viewed as “good” in any way despite the potential upside of PTG.\nPTG is neither universal nor guaranteed. Not all individuals undergoing challenging life circumstances will experience significant growth, and that’s perfectly acceptable. Practitioners should not inadvertently set the expectation that trauma survivors must demonstrate PTG as a measure of their recovery.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn our exploration of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) facilitation, we’ve delved into a wealth of insights grounded in Tedeschi and Calhoun’s extensive research. By examining the theoretical foundations of PTG, the profound role of practitioners as ‘expert companions,’ the readiness approach, the five key elements of facilitation, the practical application of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) tool, as well as factors predisposed to PTG and important caveats, we’ve equipped practitioners with a comprehensive introductory toolkit. This toolkit, enriched with visual aids, not only enhances the understanding of PTG but also empowers practitioners to guide and support individuals on their transformative journeys.\n\nReferences",

This updated framework aims to provide practitioners and educators with a robust, synergistic approach to promoting PTG through pedagogical strategies that are multiplicative—touching multiple elements simultaneously—rather than additive.\n\n---\n\n**Revised Unified Framework**\n\nThe updated framework emphasizes the following core components:\n\n1. **Autonomic Regulation (Polyvagal Theory)**\n   - Understanding and leveraging the autonomic nervous system (ANS) states to create safety and promote engagement.\n   - Techniques to prevent shutdown (dorsal vagal state) and channel sympathetic activation into growth-promoting activities.\n\n2. **Expert Companionship**\n   - The facilitator's role as an 'expert companion' who guides, supports, and empowers individuals through their PTG journey.\n   - Emphasis on creating emotionally safe environments for constructive self-disclosure and narrative development.\n\n3. **Five Elements of PTG Facilitation**\n   - **Psychoeducation**: Educating about trauma responses and the potential for growth.\n   - **Emotional Regulation**: Shifting from intrusive to reflective thinking.\n   - **Constructive Self-Disclosure**: Encouraging sharing in a safe environment.\n   - **Narrative Development**: Crafting a coherent and empowering personal narrative.\n   - **Service & Resilient Life Principles**: Engaging in meaningful activities and adopting resilient philosophies.\n\n4. **Synergistic, Multiplicative Techniques**\n   - Practices that simultaneously engage multiple components of PTG facilitation and Polyvagal Theory.\n   - Focus on methods that can be directly incorporated into educational settings.\n\n---\n\n**Updated Diagrams**\n\n### **Diagram 1: The Polyvagal-Informed PTG Facilitation Model**\n\n*Description*: This diagram integrates Polyvagal Theory with the Five Elements of PTG Facilitation, illustrating how autonomic states influence and are influenced by facilitation practices.\n\n- **Ventral Vagal State (Safety and Social Engagement)**:\n  -

      "content": "Given this new content:\n\"\"\"Parents can foster post-traumatic growth in children.\n\nPost-traumatic growth has most commonly been studied in adults, but Dr. Tedeschi said children experience silver linings, too.\n\nBy around age 8, most children are developing the cognitive maturity required to see that negative experiences may have benefits, Dr. Tedeschi said. For teenagers, he added, this capacity is even greater. Adolescence is a period “when people are more open to rethinking things,” he said. “So they, in their openness, can be pretty good at recognizing growth.”\n\nThis openness, however, doesn’t mean parents should push. Eranda Jayawickreme, a professor of psychology at Wake Forest University who studies post-traumatic growth, warned against pressuring children in a Pollyannaish way, making them think, “not only am I coping with this terrible thing, you’re telling me now that I’m supposed to grow?”\n\nInstead, parents and caregivers may serve as “expert companions,” Dr. Tedeschi explained, guiding children to a new, and potentially better, place.\n\nTo do this, Dr. Tedeschi identified five strategies that he uses in his nonprofit, Boulder Crest Foundation, which works to foster post-traumatic growth in first-responders and veterans.\nTeach kids that adversity can bring gifts. You might use stories from your life or your family’s spiritual tradition to explain how overcoming a difficulty can leave people stronger. Or, you can approach the same idea through brain science. For example, nonprofits like Turnaround for Children offer curriculums to teach kids about neuroplasticity, or the brain’s ability to adapt and change when we take on challenges and learn new things.\n\nPrepare for difficult emotions. Sharing experience is essential for post-traumatic growth. But to effectively discuss and process those difficulties, children need techniques to deal with emotions like sadness, rage and anxiety. Jonah, an 11-year-old from San Francisco, struggled with remote learning and has autism and A.D.H.D. There was a list of activities on the fridge — cuddle his cat, lie like a starfish on his bed, take deep breaths — to try when he was on the verge of a meltdown.\n\nDr. Tedeschi noted that caregivers also need emotional regulation skills, because they too can become overwhelmed when children express distress.\n\nListen. But don’t judge. Expert companions are people who can listen openly, without “closing things up with platitudes and easy answers,” Dr. Tedeschi said. But this requires doing something that can feel counterintuitive: prompting children to disclose the details of a difficult experience, even more than once.\n\nAsk questions about tough times. Listen to your kids without judging or downplaying anything, while expressing how much you care about them.\nHelp children understand their experience. Trauma, as Dr. Tedeschi defines it, includes a loss of meaning: What you thought you knew about the world turns out to be wrong. Part of post-traumatic growth is discovering a new meaning. “Narrative development” is his term for turning the facts into a cohesive story.\n\nYou might ask, “What did this experience mean to you, all in all?” or “What do you know now that you didn’t before?” But, when helping your children assign meaning, be mindful that your values might not reflect what they are actually experiencing. You might fret because your teenager is underperforming in math, but they may be more upset about missing a season of basketball.\n\nEncourage acts of kindness. Over the years, Dr. Tedeschi has found that many people experience growth after a crisis when they choose to help others, especially those in similar situations. He suggested, for example, that a teenager who is catching up academically from the pandemic might try tutoring younger children.\n\nHelping others lends perspective to our experiences and expands on the feelings of compassion that arise when we encounter difficulties. Plus, Dr. Tedeschi said, “Having an impact on other people is very gratifying to most of us.”\"\"\"\n\nIdentify methodologies that fit into training curriculums in virtual training programs that promote post traumatic growth and then describe their mechanism of action\n",

      "content": "**Identifying Methodologies for Virtual Training Programs to Promote Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) in Children and Adolescents**\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**\n\nVirtual training programs offer a unique platform to foster Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) in children and adolescents. By integrating specific methodologies into online curriculums, educators and facilitators can create supportive environments that promote healing, resilience, and personal growth after trauma. Based on Dr. Richard Tedeschi's strategies and the principles of PTG facilitation, the following methodologies can be incorporated into virtual training programs, along with explanations of their mechanisms of action.\n\n---\n\n**1.

We created it to help accelerators and program managers focus on impact and inclusive entrepreneurship in developing/emerging ecosystems through skill-based and character-based support. \nHow to use this step-by-step guide?\nRunning accelerator programs is a young and evolving field. With limited proven research into best practices, we do not wish to claim a set formula or one-size-fits-all approach. Accelerator models vary significantly depending on their objectives. \nInstead, the guide aims to help program managers understand some of the critical choices and challenges they'll need to consider if they're considering building a program of their own. It combines lessons from previous practices and patterns we identified over the years to highlight and frame the strategic choices facing stakeholders interested in creating and running these programs. \nWe developed this guide into two sections:\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻\nThis section will help you understand our framework and assessment suite.\nSection 2: Running an Accelerator Program 🌟\nThis section covers the critical aspects of creating and running an accelerator in six simple stages. Each stage comes with a series of toolkits to help you think about your plans and the context of accelerator design.\n\n\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻 \nAlso here: Bloom Framework v0.9 - Two Pillars (draft)\nBloom's Training Framework offers a dynamic, adaptive learning environment for individuals, teams, and organizations through a guided project-based and cohort-based learning approach. It focuses on two core pillars:\nThe Individual: Featuring Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH), Universal Skills, Character Strengths, and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessments.\nThe Organization: Featuring the Organizational Development Assessment.\nThe framework helps assess core strengths and weaknesses, prioritizing areas for learning and development. Our goal is to simplify the creation of custom learning journeys, enabling teams and program managers to identify optimal learning opportunities, foster a supportive environment, and positively impact businesses.\nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for improvement across both pillars, ensuring simultaneous development and, for example, improving an individual's skill through activities that address core organizational needs.\nEntrepreneurs identify their priority development areas based on assessment results and customize their learning journey with program managers, co-creating a tailored curriculum for the cohort.\nOur framework is based on proven cohort-based and project-based learning methods combined with the power of mentorship. Peer learning enhances the experience, while project-based learning aligns objectives with a mission or vision, fostering intrinsic motivation. Using a flipped classroom approach, entrepreneurs first digest relevant content, reflect on their learnings, and apply them in their enterprises. They then meet with their cohort for peer feedback and mentorship, using what they learn in real-life settings.\nOur programs nurture individual and organizational development, promoting cooperation over competition and leveraging collective intelligence to solve pressing societal problems.\nThe Bloom Training Framework is versatile and can be used in various contexts, including companies, educational programs (youth, school, university), startup accelerators, and short events like startup sprints or hackathons.\n\nOur Principles\nWe use the following guiding principles to evaluate and prioritize program activities:\nKeep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat. (Upside down pyramid) \\/\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the teams in our programs to help them do the right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on extraneous, nonaligned activities. We want to keep the teams and participants in the driver's seat and help them develop decision-making skills. We can help people develop skills of effectiveness by creating an enabling environment. \nTransformation > Information. Make available knowledge actionable. (Library content)  \nPrioritizing transformative learning experiences over mere information dissemination ensures that knowledge is applied in meaningful ways. By providing actionable insights and practical tools, we create an environment where learning translates into real-world impact.\nGet the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessments)\nOptimizing team composition by aligning individual strengths and roles enhances overall team effectiveness. Through comprehensive assessments, we identify key areas for personal and professional growth, enabling targeted interventions that maximize individual and collective potential.\nWhy integrate individual growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team is determined by the development of each individual who comprises it. So, while personal development and well-being are also an end, we ensure that the teams are more robust and the organization is more likely to keep going. Instilling such resilience helps cultivate values-driven people and a community of social change makers with a growth mindset and a contributor attitude. \nCreate an enabling environment in the program and support the broader ecosystem.\nFostering a supportive community within cohort-based programs is essential for creating an enabling environment where entrepreneurs can thrive. By nurturing a culture of collaboration and mutual support, we enhance the learning experience and contribute to the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem. We win when we win together. \n\nPillar 1: The Individual\nBloom recommends the following individual development assessments:\nWellbeing & Engagement: at work & in life (through PERMAH)\nEntrepreneurship & Leadership Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of entrepreneurship and leadership \nCharacter Strengths: through VIA, Values in Action \nUniversal Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of work and life)\n 1.1. Wellbeing & Engagement \nOur Wellbeing and Engagement assessment is rooted in the principles of positive psychology and aims to measure human flourishing. This assessment evaluates six critical dimensions. These dimensions are essential indicators of a well-lived life, each contributing uniquely to an individual's overall sense of wellbeing.\nPositivity: Measures the extent to which an individual experiences positive emotions, crucial for enhancing resilience and overall mental health.\nEngagement: Assesses the level of involvement and absorption in activities, reflecting a flow state where individuals are fully immersed and find deep satisfaction.\nRelationships: Evaluates the quality of an individual's connections with others, recognizing that supportive and fulfilling relationships are fundamental to wellbeing.\nMeaning: Gauges the sense of purpose and direction in life, indicating how much individuals feel their lives have significance and contribute to something greater.\nAchievement: Measures the accomplishment of goals and the sense of mastery, highlighting the importance of setting and achieving personal and professional objectives.\nHealth: Assesses physical wellbeing, acknowledging that a healthy body is essential for overall life satisfaction.\nUsing the PERMAH framework, we ensure our programs focus on professional success and personal flourishing. This approach helps individuals and organizations achieve sustainable success by aligning personal wellbeing with organizational goals. \n1.2. Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\nThe Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessment evaluates proficiency in recognizing opportunities, mobilizing resources, and taking effective action in various contexts. This assessment is based on the EntreComp framework, a comprehensive tool developed by the European Commission to promote entrepreneurship education and training. EntreComp offers a common reference framework that defines the key competencies necessary for entrepreneurial behavior and mindset.\nWe use the EntrepComp framework to help people build skills along six dimensions:\n\n1.3. Character Strengths \nCharacter strengths are invaluable tools that guide us in developing skills and enhancing our effectiveness in any endeavor. Leveraging these strengths makes learning new things more accessible and enjoyable. In Bloom programs, we use the Values in Action (VIA) Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their “Signature Strengths.” These strengths appear naturally and authentically, providing energy rather than requiring effort. Using our Signature Strengths promotes well-being and vitality in the workplace, leading to greater engagement and productivity. The VIA assessment analyzes virtues and values across cultures, identifying 24 universally recognized character strengths. These strengths are clustered into six core virtues:\n\nWisdom and Knowledge: Creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective, and innovation. These strengths enable us to gain and use knowledge effectively.\nCourage: Bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality, and zest. These strengths help us face challenges and pursue goals despite obstacles.\nHumanity: Love, kindness, and social intelligence. These strengths foster meaningful and supportive relationships with others.\nJustice: Citizenship, fairness, and leadership. These strengths contribute to a just and equitable community.\nTemperance: Forgiveness and mercy, humility, prudence, and self-control. These strengths help us regulate our behaviors and emotions.\nTranscendence: Appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, and spirituality. These strengths connect us to something greater and provide a sense of purpose and meaning.\nBy identifying and using our Signature Strengths, we can bring energy and positivity to our work, fostering a thriving and productive environment. This approach to personal development ensures that individuals achieve professional success and lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.\n1.4. Universal Skills.  \nUniversal Skills are competencies that benefit individuals across all organizational sectors and roles. These skills are critical to our personal development framework, ensuring team members can thrive regardless of their specific personal or professional requirements. Our approach to developing Universal Skills is guided by the Universal Skills Framework from SkillsBuilder.org, which categorizes these skills into four key dimensions:\nCommunication: Enhancing the ability to convey ideas clearly and effectively fostering better understanding and collaboration.\nProblem Solving: Equipping individuals to analyze situations, identify challenges, and develop practical solutions, thereby improving decision-making and innovation.\nSelf-Management: Developing personal discipline, time management, and resilience to navigate complex tasks and maintain productivity under pressure.\nTeamwork: Cultivating the skills necessary for effective collaboration, including empathy, cooperation, and working harmoniously in diverse teams.\nFocusing on these four dimensions ensures that our team members are equipped with versatile skills applicable in any context. This development approach enhances individual performance and contributes to our organization's overall effectiveness and adaptability. Using the Universal Skills Framework, we provide structured and targeted training that supports continuous personal and professional growth, ensuring that our teams are well-prepared to meet the demands of the modern workplace.\nHow To Apply the Individual Development Framework:  \nRequest your participants to take the Bloom Individual Development assessments on the Bloom Platform, which include Universal Skills, Well-being and Engagement, and Character Strengths.\nIn program cycles, discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers can help participants identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from their knowledge, online resources, or the Bloom Library of Activities. \nFor Character Strengths:\nAfter the individuals take the Character Strengths assessments, you can request individuals and teams to identify their Signature Strengths.\nOnce they’ve identified their Signature Strengths, request individuals to select a priority area within their Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills results on the Bloom Learn tab.\nEnd-of-program assessments help participants and program managers see growth and chart paths for further improvement.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Bloom Personal Framework involves critical skills and values that help you be effective as a person.\nIt includes Well-being & Engagement, Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills, Character Strengths and Universal Skills.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nUniversal Skills – Bloom\nWellbeing and Motivation – Bloom\nCharacter Strengths – Bloom\n\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nThe Skills Builder Partnership\nPermah Survey Home - The PERMAH Wellbeing Survey\nVIA Character Strengths Survey & Character Reports | VIA Institute\n\nPillar 2: The Organization\nBloom recommends the following organizational development assessment:\nThe Organizational Development Assessment is a way to assess your enterprise’s organizational status and needs quickly. Teams use it as a self-assessment tool, a guided collaborative process, or program managers can do third-party assessments.\n2.1. Organizational Development  \nOrganizational Capacity is the ability of an organization to achieve its mission while anticipating and managing future changes and risks. Our Organizational Capacity Assessment is derived from established methodologies by international consulting firms, tailored specifically for enterprises and accelerators. Bloom’s Organizational Capacities assessment helps organizations identify blind spots, providing a 360-degree perspective on their current state and guiding them in selecting development areas that will have the most impact. We offer adapted versions of the assessment for enterprises, early-stage enterprises, and accelerators.\nThe Organizational Capacity Assessment categories are:\n\n🎯 Strategy\n📲 Products and Services\n💶 Revenues, Financial Management & Sustainability\n🫶🏽 Corporate Social Responsibility\n🤝 Community Engagement & Communication\n🧑 Team, Leadership, Staff & Volunteers\n👨‍🏫 Innovation & Learning\n🧑🏽‍⚖️ Legal & Compliance\n⚠️ Infrastructure, Risk, Security & Resilience\n\nWhy a Self-Assessment?\nSelf-assessments provide rich information about organizational capacity and inform performance monitoring plans. They are primarily tools for capacity strengthening rather than performance evaluation. A critical aspect of a participatory assessment is fostering a safe space where staff can freely discuss an enterprise’s issues and priorities without fear of consequences when highlighting organizational weaknesses, challenges, and needs for improvement. In summary, self-assessment is a self-diagnosis process where an enterprise reflects on its performance, identifies priorities and goals, and sets a path toward achieving benchmarks. An Enterprise Capacity Assessment supports organizational decision-making and ownership of the capacity development process.\nResults Debrief and Analysis\nThe purpose of this step is to analyze the results with the assessment group so the enterprise can digest and understand the results and compare its current capacity against its longer-term goals. The presentation and discussion of results should be non-judgmental and positive. \nSuggested Steps:\nOpen the session and welcome everyone \nExplain the purpose of this meeting.\nReiterate that all results are indicators rather than performance assessments and encourage continued active participation\nDiscuss and analyze the results\nDiscuss each category with questions such as\nWhat is your reaction to these results? Are there any surprises?\nWhat are your observations about the enterprise’s overall capacity in this category?\nAre the scores for each indicator polarized or consistent with each other? Why?\nWhat is the enterprise doing well? What can the enterprise learn from success in this area?\nSummarize the discussion by highlighting the most surprising results or eliciting the most significant difference in opinion. \nReflect on the assessment results\nAsk the participants to discuss the following questions::\nWhat are our most important issues or weaknesses as an enterprise?\nWhat is causing these issues?\nIdentify key capacity issues revealed during the assessment.\nLook for root causes of issues, not just symptoms.\nIdentify issues common to multiple capacity areas.\nPriority Setting and Action Planning\nThis step helps the enterprise prioritize the issues identified during the assessment for inclusion in the Organization's Development Plan. \nSuggested Steps:\nLink the problems identified with the objectives\nStart with a discussion using these prompts\nDo you think any of the issues identified are more critical than others? Why?\nWhich categories or sub-categories would foster the most significant change in bringing the enterprise closer to its vision and goals?\nAsk the participants to vote on which objective they consider priorities over the next cycle and which should be in the Organization's Development Plan.\nExplain that the number of categories or subcategories to include depends on the time to implement the plan, the complexity of activities, and the resources required. Encourage the group to be pragmatic. \nIdentify key results and significant initiatives for each objective.\nWhat relevant milestones would your enterprise expect to achieve within the program timeframe?\nHow To Apply the Organizational Development Framework:  \nThe program manager invites teams and participants to take the relevant Organization Capacities assessment on the Bloom platform (Enterprise Capacities or Accelerator Capacities). \nAfter participants take the assessment, they are requested to go over their results and discuss with their team, mentor, and program manager to select their priority areas of development and the particular objectives they would like to achieve during the program. \nThe Organization Development Plan is documented using Bloom’s template for the duration of the program and is a shared document between the teams, the mentors, and the program manager. \nRegular progress check-ins during program cycles help the team, mentors, and program managers stay on track, adjust where needed, solve problems, and track progress.\nTeams periodically take the assessment (whole or just for their priority development areas) to celebrate growth and improvements!\n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Bloom framework's second pillar is organizational development. It includes the “doing” work of a person, team, or organization and the skills that help a team flourish. \nIt includes the ​​CAT (Capacity Assessment Tool) system, with specific assessments using categories and questions adapted to the needs of teams and programs. \n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nECAT – Bloom\nProgram Dashboard for [Team Name] Template - Enterprise Capacities v1.1\n\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nAssessing your strengths and weaknesses with the McKinsey Organizational Capacity Assessment Tool (OCAT)\n\n\nSection 2: Running A Program\nStage 0: Preparations\nIn this section, we provide basic information on how accelerators operate. It covers the critical aspects of creating and finalizing program basics.\nProgram Design\nWe can adapt our programs to meet the partner's objectives best, whether for economic development, education, impact/CSR purposes, corporate development, staff training, corporate innovation/intrapreneurship, or others. We refine each approach to design the best program to deliver the desired results. \nSome program design parameters include \nNumber of Teams: Varies by partner\nWe aim to have twice as many teams in the sprint phase as a general rule\nTeam Composition: Varies by partner\nWe generally recommend having at least two team members actively working on the enterprise though it varies depending on enterprise stage.\nEnterprise Stage: From pre-idea, concept/idea stage, startup, or established enterprise. \nEnterprise Development Stages\nStages\nSub-Stages\n0. LEARNING\t\n0.1. Learning without the goal of launching an enterprise\n1. IDEATION\n1.1. Want to start and looking for/testing ideas\n2. IDEA-STAGE\n2.1. Exploring ideas, conducting market/customer research \n2.2. Have started developing my idea\n3. PROTOTYPE\n3.1. Have an early (low-fidelity/paper) prototype (of product or service)\n3.2. Have a functioning (high-fidelity) prototype with early users / early adopters\n4. EARLY-STAGE\n4.1. Declining revenues and the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.2. Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.3. Revenues are multiplying, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n5. GROWTH-STAGE\n5.1. Profitable/sustainable business\n5.2. Seeking scalability (of impact and profits)\n5.3. Seeking diversification \n5.4. Seeking an exit \n5.5. Established national enterprise\n5.6. Established multinational enterprise\n\n\nGeography: Varies by partner\nWithin an internal accelerator/entrepreneurship program or across the UAE, GCC, MENA, or global.\nFunding to Teams: Varies by partner\nImpact Areas: Varies by partner\nGenerally aligned with the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) or for other impact purposes. \nOther criteria: To determine with a partner.\nDefinition of success and program results\nBased on the objectives of the accelerator program, program managers and accelerators can get results to measure the program’s success. We list some later in this guide, but discussing them while building and designing your program is also helpful. \nThe accelerator program work plan will set the tone for program results. Each objective set is measurable and timely and allows for a quantifiable measurement of success. \nAdditionally, impact metrics can be measured depending on the program objectives, including but not limited to jobs created, revenues generated, new product launches, and more. \nProgram Communications\nDeveloping a solid brand is critical in attracting enterprises and other stakeholders. Choosing the best enterprises will lead to good results, attract good investors, and reliable applications. Targeted marketing and clear communication about the program’s criteria, what it offers, and to whom is critical. Creating a content strategy should be the first step.\nA content strategy is a plan of action purposely designed to guide content marketing activities and ensure they deliver against a specific objective. It includes content planning, production, publishing, promoting, tracking, and SEO optimization. It also consists of content you produce, such as videos, blog posts, podcasts, and social media posts. \nYou can see a sample content plan here: HerMeNow Communications Plan (draft)\nSample draft posts for this campaign here: ​​ HerMeNow posts \nThe idea is to ensure that each piece of content you produce resonates heavily with your target audience and serves to rally people behind your program’s objectives. \nSome questions to consider at this stage:\nWhich channels or events would be relevant for marketing your particular program?\nWhich networks would be most effective for reaching the type of enterprises you’d like to work with?\nHow could you communicate the criteria for your program?\nTarget Audience\nAccelerator programs must create a compelling offer to attract the most promising entrepreneurs. \nAccelerators can engage with multiple organizations, stakeholders, and channels to source and attract startups. These include\nReferral from entrepreneurs affiliated with the accelerator\nInvestors\nEntrepreneurial associations\nUniversities\nIndustry Association\nSector-specific conferences\nInbound requests from marketing efforts and social media\nOutbound direct recruiting by finding and contacting entrepreneurs on the web.\nThe quality of applications is far more critical than quantity. Attracting enterprises without growth potential or entrepreneurs for whom the accelerator has nothing to offer will be useless. \nPlanning, roles, and timeline\nWe train others to run high-impact enterprise development support programs that leverage online and in-person engagement. Every program we design has the below-standard program stages.\n\nOnce you agree with the partner on the program parameters, you can start designing the program. \nSee the toolkit at the end of this stage for the program design and planning templates.\nMentor Engagement\nMentorship is a cornerstone of growth in entrepreneurship and leadership, offering invaluable guidance, support, and networking opportunities. We do not pay our mentors to foster a culture of altruism, shared learning, and community engagement, which are critical for building resilient entrepreneurial ecosystems.\nResearch shows that intrinsically motivated mentors provide higher-quality guidance and derive greater satisfaction from mentoring. Effective mentorship builds social capital, creating networks of trust and reciprocity that benefit both mentors and mentees. Non-financial incentives, such as recognition, personal growth, and the opportunity to give back, lead to more committed and impactful mentoring relationships.\nMentors also benefit through reciprocal learning, staying updated with new trends, and gaining fresh perspectives, which enhances their leadership skills. By not monetarily compensating mentors, we emphasize the mutual benefits of mentorship grounded in intrinsic motivation and community spirit.\nA quality mentoring program is crucial for reducing the risk of enterprise failure and is a critical component of successful accelerators. We attract a diverse range of mentors with domain knowledge and entrepreneurial experience, offering two types of mentorship:\nKey Mentors: The principal mentor for a team in our programs. Program managers match you with an enterprise based on your preference and the needs of the business. You will follow the company throughout the program, meeting (online) 1-2 times per month and offering support and guidance when needed.\nTopic Mentors: Topic Mentors support teams in specific areas of expertise (e.g., marketing, HR, etc.).  \nOur mentor selection is based on referrals and direct applications, focusing on extensive entrepreneurial experience rather than academic credentials. We prioritize mentors interested in practical implementation and immediate progress, ensuring that mentoring sessions are action-oriented and impactful.\nTeams and mentors can keep track of their meetings and progress using the “mentor journal” template: Mentorship Journal for [Team Name]\nAny program needs to be monitored and assessed. The quality of mentorship can be evaluated through feedback surveys that the enterprises complete. This information is part of a feedback loop that allows constant improvement in the mentorship process.\nPartner Engagement\nThe partners’ building block consists of the network of suppliers and partners that makes the business model work.\nA successful partnership is most likely to occur when partners lay out clear guidelines at the very start. You are working with each other because partners/NGOs bring something unique and distinctive. So there must be a clear articulation of the end goal regarding the impact and the fundamental guiding principles that will keep the relationship together.\nThese include monitoring mechanisms, reporting requirements, expectations regarding shared resources and engagement levels, mutually agreed-upon communication strategies, an exit plan if things go wrong, etc. \nWe usually have the following partnerships:\nOutreach partners:\nCommunity engagement and outreach\nEngaging your community online and offline (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter networks, along with the newsletters and website) to help us source enterprises for the program.\nKnowledge partners:\nHelp provide mentors, trainers, or experts in relevant sectors or startup/enterprise development areas\nConducting online workshops (ranging from 2 hours to multi-day workshops; preferably recorded sessions), providing mentorship for participating impact startups, helping make relevant connections, etc.\nEcosystem partners:\nSupport for participating projects during the program or downstream\nThey provide additional support, resources, perks, or opportunities to the participating enterprises, whether during or after the program, such as investment/grants, partnerships/contracts, conference/visibility, services, etc. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nTo prepare for launch, program managers need to consider the following:\nTarget audience and stage of enterprises\nDefinition of success and program KPIs\nEssential program communication\nStaffing, roles, and timeline\nMentor engagement\nPartner engagement\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nProgram Design Template\nProgram Planning Template v2\nMentorship Journal for [Team Name]\nPartner MOU - All Categories - TEMPLATE\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nSTARTUP ACCELERATOR PROGRAMMES A Practice Guide\nThe Mentor Manifesto: The original “Mentor Manifesto,” created by David Cohen with the help of Jon Bradford and Brad Feld, outlines a set of principles supported by years of accelerator work and thousands of mentor interactions.\nDeconstructing the Mentor Manifesto: Brad Feld goes in depth through each component of the manifesto. \n\nStage 1: Outreach & Open House\nThe program starts with an Open House period. It refers to when a team becomes aware of the existence of an accelerator program. The accelerator’s success in this phase depends on the strength of its brand and how it markets itself. The Open House events are typically virtual and open to the public.\nOur Open Houses are a way to ask questions and get answers. You can join virtually to learn more about learning to grow in our accelerator programs and build connections. As a result, teams leave with a better understanding of our program and if it may be a good fit for them.\nOpen House Events\nDuring these 4-6 weeks, we host online webinars featuring prominent speakers sharing their experiences with aspiring entrepreneurs. It is also a space for applicants to meet and start forming a community. Here are some blog posts recapping previous open-house events.\nThere are four main reasons to run an Open House:  \nAttract, vet, and prepare applicants \nDid we attract the quality and quantity of intended teams? \nIdentify participants that may be appropriate for an online program and this program. \nHelp people become more familiar with the tools and approaches of the program. \nBring visibility to the program and the partner.\nProgram managers can record each open house event and transform it into a blog post to share on social media to attract more applicants.\nRecorded events become part of a shareable library of content accessible to the Bloom community.\nInspire and educate the potential applicants\nThe topics for the open house events are timely and relevant to the current situation to help the applicants learn something new about their trade.\nThe events are an opportunity for the program managers to present the program and for the applicants to ask questions.\nBring visibility to Bloom and engage/strengthen the Bloom community (mentors, broader startups, partners, etc.)  \nEngaging the mentors by asking them to participate as speakers \nEngaging the partners by inviting them and asking them to intervene\nShowcasing startups that have been in the program previously\nApplication Form\nChoosing which enterprises to select is one of the essential factors in the success of any accelerator. While attracting the entrepreneurs to the Open House events, we place them in a marketing funnel to submit to the second stage of the application process. This stage includes demographic information and details about the enterprise.\nDepending on your program, you can select different criteria, such as\nDemographic Data\nGender\nAge\nLocation\nNationality\nInformation about the enterprise/startup: \nWebsite and social media links \nPlease describe your company and the problem you're solving in 280 characters.\n2 min pitch\nFive slide pitch deck\nEnterprise Stage: dropdown\nAreas of development: Enterprise Capacities dropdown\nTraction\nSize of team\nInvestment Raised\nRegistration Status\nIt is essential to keep in mind that the quality of applications is far more critical than quantity. Attracting enterprises without growth potential or entrepreneurs for whom the accelerator has nothing to offer will be useless. Targeted marketing and clear communication about the program’s criteria, what it provides, and to whom are critical.\nSummarized list of things to prepare:\nBrevo Registration Form\nAutomated Email on Brevo with link to apply\nProgram on Bloom platform under the correct organization\nApplication Link on the Bloom platform\nAutomated email on Mailgun to confirm receiving their application\nAutomated Reminder Email on Brevo after they start their application to complete it\nStart here category on Bloom community program category with intro video and FAQ\nCreating the application\nStep 1: Create a form on Brevo with: First and Last Name, Email, and Company Name\nStep 2: Create an automated email that gets sent for each form submission with more details about the program and the link to the second stage application form\nCreating the second stage application form \nStep 1: Decide which fields to include in the application form.

In a nutshell, it’s a way for teams to spend a fixed amount of time on core enterprise development using today’s best practices in a coherent, integrated fashion. \nWe also sometimes run longer versions of Sprints that we call Bootcamps, usually between 4-8 weeks long. The key difference lies in the number of sessions:\nA Sprint is two weeks long and include 6 sessions (3 sessions per week) plus a Demo Day\nA Bootcamp can vary between 4 to 8 weeks:\nA 4 week Bootcamp has 3 sessions (one session per week) plus a Demo Day\nAn 8 week Bootcamp has 6 sessions (one session per week) plus a Demo Day\nIn Bloom’s standard programs, the Sprint/Bootcamp has two main objectives: \nTo help teams learn new skills and progress in their enterprise. \nTo help us learn more about the teams during our selection process for the Accelerator. \nWe’ve found that we learn more about the people and projects through a short program than through an application process and interviews. So here is how we do it:\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp allows us to assess enterprises’ strengths as we look for entrepreneurs who can overcome the obstacles necessary to build a great business. This phase helps us get to know and understand why teams have an unfair advantage over all the other candidates.\nSelection from Open House to Sprint/Bootcamp/Pre-Accelerator\nFirst, we disqualify candidates who do not check all eligibility criteria. Then, a selection committee will score the selection against the following scoring matrix.\n\nEligibility\nAssessing whether the application fits the program's eligibility criteria.\nYES / NO \nTeam \nAssessing the team’s background, capabilities to execute, and ability to gain and contribute to the program. \n/ 10\nImpact & Inclusion\nDoes the enterprise have a social impact? Can it create jobs? Does it have a positive impact on marginalized and vulnerable communities?\n/ 10\nValue Proposition\nIs the team tackling a real problem and offering a valuable solution? Does it have the ability to grow and be sustainable? Is the market potential attractive?\n/ 10\nMilestones & Traction\nCan the idea generate revenues? Have they achieved significant milestones? Has the team demonstrated it can compete?\n/ 5\nStrategy & Challenges\nDo they have a clear growth strategy? Is the program able to support the team in its current challenges?\n/ 5\nOverall Passion\nBased on the team's strength,  the project, and the potential impact it can create: how passionate are you about this application?\n/ 10\n\nSprint/Bootcamp Session Objectives\nOutlined below are some of the frameworks and tools we use during the Sprint session to help the enterprises progress on their goals and improve at least one aspect of their enterprise during the Sprint/Bootcamp sessions. \nDiscovering your Why: How do you talk about what you do?\nThe Golden Circle is a concept developed by Simon Sinek, who says, “people don’t buy what you do. They buy why you do it.”\nAccording to Sinek, most people communicate by starting with the “what” they do and eventually work their way back to talk about “how” and “why” they do what they do.\nBut companies universally identified as unique and successful think Apple or Google communicate with an “inside-out” type of thinking. \nThey start with the why, and only then do they talk about the how and what portions of what they do.\nTo use the Golden Circle for your enterprise, just help them answer three simple questions:\nWhy – Why are you doing what you are doing? For example, why are you in business, and why did you develop your product or service?\nHow – How will this help your readers? For example, what problems are you solving for your readers, and what challenges are you helping them overcome?\nWhat – What are you offering? For example, what is your product or service, and what are its features and benefits?\nAssessing: What are your priorities for the upcoming period?\nProgram managers invite the teams to take the assessments to reflect on their individual and organizational development. After reflecting on their results in their teams, program managers invite them to discuss them with their peers and mentors and start thinking about their core priority areas of development.\nGoal setting: What are your objectives for the duration of the accelerator?\nWe provide the enterprises with a framework to specify their objectives for the upcoming period they spend with us during the accelerator, usually three to four months. The enterprises must accompany these objectives with measurable key results assigned to specific team members for accountability. The enterprise can further break down objectives into particular initiatives and key activities. We recommend that enterprises work on at least one objective and up to three objectives for the duration of the accelerator. Each objective must relate to a particular organizational development topic they identified while reflecting on their priorities. \nWe invite teams to develop an Organization Development Plan stating their main objective related to their core area of organizational development. We also consider their signature character strength and overall well-being for the program duration. Teams will also develop this Organization Development Plan with a budget to help the Bloom team assess the needs accordingly.\nBudgeting: How will you use the funds allocated for the accelerator?\nWe provide enterprises with a budgeting tool to help them think about allocating their funds to the accelerator program. It allows them to think strategically about their objectives and goals, given their plans earlier during the week around the objectives and key results they aim to achieve. Funds are allocated to specific categories to help us align the overall budgets and work on economies of scale. \nPitching: How will you combine this using the Pitch Deck template?\nA pitch deck is usually a 5-10 slide presentation designed to summarize the company, the business plan, and the vision. The pitch presentation deck also serves different purposes, from meeting with a new investor to presenting in front of a stage. Each of them should follow a different structure. A demo day presentation, for example, should be very visual and contain very little text, as the entrepreneur will do all the talking. \nWe provide enterprises with a 5-10 slide deck template to adapt their branding and content accordingly. \nSelection from Sprint/Bootcamp to Accelerator\nThe program aims to help participants transform personally, professionally, and professionally. \nTo be fair, we have a 2-step process: \nStep 1: Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges \nFor the Sprint/Bootcamp phase, judges decide whether a team advances based on the team’s pitches during the online Demo Day. \nWe enlist the services of expert volunteer “Judges” who are independent and objective, with no conflicts of interest. \nThese judges review team pitches and determine each team’s potential for long-term success based on the judge’s experience and the quality of the team’s pitch during the demo day.\nJudging will take place during the online Demo Day on Zoom. \nProgram managers will share the link to submit scores with all judges before the Demo Day event. \nIf too many teams are at the end of the Sprint/Bootcamp (15 or more), it might be difficult to pitch in one group. In this case, we could split the pitch day into multiple simultaneous sessions, with up to 10 teams in a breakout session and a separate judging panel per breakout room. Representatives from each breakout session judging panel will be part of the Accelerator Selection Panel. \nWe also invite the teams to share feedback on all the pitches, though we calculate the scoring separately. \nStep 2: Accelerator Selection Panel \nPrimarily a subset of the Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges \nThe Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges' feedback will be summarized, along with the Sprint/Bootcamp Scoring Template, and shared with the Accelerator Selection Panel, which will do a final review and selection in the days following the Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day. \nAccelerator Selection Criteria\nWe measure the principles for selection with the following assessments:\nEvaluation Area\nDescription\nWeight\nEffort\nThe teams have a significant say in advancing to the next stage based on their effort during the Sprint/Bootcamp. We measure the effort according to attendance, feedback participation, and deliverables. \n1/4\nSupport\nThe teams are also scored based on how supportive they are to the other teams in the Sprint/Bootcamp. \n1/4\nCoachability\nThe team is receptive to receiving constructive criticism and will use that feedback and constructive criticism to improve their professional and organizational performance.\n1/4\nDemo Day Score\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp ends with a Demo Day where the enterprises pitch online, and judging will occur between presentations. The Judging panel will include mentors and trainers from the program and independent experts from the ecosystem. \n1/4\n\n\nThe Judges’ scores (Demo Day Score) and the Bloom team scores (Effort, Support, and Coachability) are shared with a selection panel composed of Bloom and External Experts for deliberations and donor representatives. The panel will make the final selection for acceptance in addition to the validation of support required per team. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Sprint/Bootcamp has two main objectives: \nFirst, to help teams learn new skills and progress in their enterprise. \nTo help us learn more about the teams during our selection process for the Accelerator. \nThe following frameworks guide the participants during the Sprint/Bootcamp phase:\nThe elevator pitch using the golden circle framework\nPersonal, professional, and organizational assessments\nGoal Setting\nBudgeting\nPreparing for the demo day\nThe selection process includes:\nSelecting for the Sprint/Bootcamp based on eligibility and scoring for success using metrics defined by program objectives\nSelecting for the accelerator, based on the demo day scoring and scores for effort, community, and results\nTOOLKIT: (diagnostic assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nThe Golden Circle Presentation\nECAT – Bloom\nProgram Planning Template v2\nSprint Detailed Schedule Template\nSample Program Comms\nProgram Dashboard for [Team Name] Template - Enterprise Capacities v1.1\nSprint Pitch Deck Template\nSprint Scoring Template―\nStage 3: Onboarding and Curriculum Design\nOnboarding to the Accelerator\nAfter announcing the teams that will proceed to the accelerator stage, the program manager spends time with each selected team to\nRefine their dashboards and align their objectives and initiatives with the Enterprise Capacities categories, keeping in mind the below recommendations:\nThe enterprise's objectives should align with its overall objective for the program.\nThe objectives are achievable within the timeframe of the program.\nEach objective has a key result that should be measurable with a starting value and a target value that measures progress toward an objective.\nEach initiative aligns with the set category and topics.\nThe “enterprise development topics” for initiatives are valid and aligned with the “enterprise development category” for the related objective.\nThe enterprise might be unsure how to match its objectives with the “enterprise development category.” The program manager can help them refine their dashboard during these one-on-ones\nHelp the teams add their priorities on the platform\nOnce the dashboards are clear for the team and the program manager, the team will log on to the platform and start adding their priorities:\nThe team navigates to the Growth page.\nThe team selects their priority area per their dashboard (the “Enterprise Development Category” for their first objective).\nIn the “add goal details” text box, the team adds their objective, key results, and initiatives\nExplain the individual assessments to the teams, help them identify their signature character strength, and select their priority areas for skills \nThe program manager will explain the individual assessments:\nThe teams can take the Character Strength Assessment on the Bloom Platform and identify their “Signature Strength.” It is a strength that shows up quickly and authentically, giving people energy when used rather than taking effort. Using our Signature Strengths can help us bring energy and promote well-being at work. Once they do that, they should add their Signature Strength on their dashboard so we can support them in leveraging it during the program.\nTeams can take the Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills assessment on the Bloom platform to identify areas of improvement. In discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers, they can identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from online resources or the Bloom Library of Activities. \nCustomizing the Curriculum\nWe strive to adapt the curriculum to each new cohort of enterprises that best caters to their needs. We base this customization on inputs from the Growth Page on the platform:\nOnce we complete the onboarding process, we have a clear view of all the teams’ priorities and objectives for the duration of the program, allowing us to customize the curriculum accordingly.\nThe Assessment results of each enterprise: We look at priorities selected during the onboarding and the score trends in each category.\nThe Team's Organization Development Plans: We look at the specific objective and initiatives to understand what they aim to achieve.\nAt this stage, the program manager and the training manager can design the cohort-based training activities that the teams will do during the program and prepare for the first session of the accelerator program. \nWhile we aim to find commonalities between all the teams, it is never possible to cater to everyone’s needs. Once we set the common needs, we reach out to the teams with individual needs to help them identify training activities they can do at their own pace and get feedback from mentors and trainers individually.\nLearning by Doing\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, there is nothing more important than “doing” and “testing” to understand the product, customers, and business model. At Bloom, we know how much theory we introduce to entrepreneurs versus how much time we give them to achieve results. Teaching entrepreneurs theory is inevitable — it is crucial to understand the context — but we make sure that every idea comes with a framework or a tool that entrepreneurs can use and develop over time to achieve their goals. These tools make robust theories actionable. Once we introduce them to our program, we make an effort to revisit them during the program over and over again, in the best spirit of lean startup methodology, so we make sure we are helping the startups drive progress and results.\nModular Learning\nModular learning, as the word connotes, uses learning modules that facilitate entrepreneurs learning by themselves. It is a form of distance learning that uses Self-Learning Modules based on the essential learning competencies developed by the trainers with the aid of the program and training manager.\nWhen there’s teaching, it’s tempting to sit students down in a classroom and show them what they need to know. But GALI found that “the more remote work we allow, the better.” For example, indirect learning, which focuses on the student’s inquiry and exploration rather than the teacher’s instruction, allows entrepreneurs to learn while working on their business plans and product. \nAccelerators should design curricula around things entrepreneurs do remotely that serve the dual function of teaching valuable lessons and helping advance the startup. It is better to use the time to build relationships and get feedback. Online education with e-learning modules allows founders to spend more time building networks and products.\nOnce the teams complete the training activity, we invite them to share their work in the community to get feedback from their peers and program managers. They will then join an online training session to get further feedback from their peers and expert trainers. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nCurriculums are customized according to teams’ Enterprise Capacities results, Organization Development Plan, surveys, and one-on-one interviews to identify the most present needs\nContent is created well before training sessions so entrepreneurs can learn at their own pace, apply their learning on homework, templates, and tools, and get feedback in sessions with the trainers.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nProgram Planning Template v2\nBloom Digital Library\n\nStage 4: Accelerator \nBloom Accelerator Programs Principles\nBelow are the five principles that guide the design of our accelerator programs.\nPraxis: learning happens by doing and reflecting.\nPraxis is the process by which a skill is embodied or realized. \"Praxis\" refers to engaging, applying, exercising, learning, or practicing ideas. Praxis is critical thinking that combines reflection and action.\nBloom tools: In our programs, this is applied by encouraging enterprises to record their daily tasks and activities on the Bloom task board. \nStrengths Oriented: use momentum and do more of what’s working.\nThe strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes of a person or a group rather than the negative ones. This approach builds on the entrepreneurs’ strengths, specifically seeing them as resourceful and resilient when in adverse conditions. Strengths are integral to our human identity, constituting the intrinsic and inherent qualities that define us as individuals. However, few are conscious and appreciative of them or particular about how we can best put them to use to achieve desired outcomes.\nUsing strengths energizes and motivates individuals to contribute discretionary effort towards attaining their goals. At the same time, it nourishes a feeling of achievement because they perform the things they are best at doing. Research indicates that when individuals use their strengths, they feel happier, more confident and proud, and more engaged at work. In addition, they perform better while experiencing a sense of resilience in achieving their goals. \nBloom tools: In our programs, we apply this by administering personal assessments to identify entrepreneurs’ strengths and capitalize on them through our library of activities that help build the strengths. Additionally, we developed the Enterprise Capacity Assessment to measure the organizational capacity of enterprises. It allows us to have the whole picture of the strengths of both the entrepreneur and the enterprise.\nGrowth Mindset: 1% better every day, 200% better in 70 days.\nA growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and stretching our existing abilities. Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. As a result, they tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). It is because they worry less about looking bright and put more energy into learning. \nStriving to get 1% better daily is a core tenet of the growth mindset principle. This system encourages action by breaking down big, overwhelming goals into small, discrete pieces. The small successes you experience with your baby steps feed on each other and start building momentum, leading to more prominent and significant moves.\nWe encourage our entrepreneurs to try to do just 1% better than the day before. Start small and make your increases gradual. Avoid the temptation to get impatient and start rushing forward and taking more significant leaps. Take it slow, steady, and consistent.\nSimply try to do a little better than you did the day before. Daily, just focus on getting 1% better in whatever you try to improve. That’s it. Just 1%. It might not seem like much, but those 1% improvements compound each other. \nBloom Tools: Our programs encourage entrepreneurs to look at their weekly power moves. Power Moves are the moves that take us out of our comfort zone and push us forward. Those exhilarating first steps allow us to make many more steps. Power Moves take you right out of your regularly scheduled program. They are the key to real change. They’re the most critical task that will take you one step closer to your goal.\nStep by Step: Pick a target, make it tractable, get to it, and review it.\nBreaking projects down into their parts is oft-repeated advice when tackling something big. Breaking tasks down helps us see large tasks as more approachable and doable and reduces our propensity to procrastinate or defer tasks because we simply don’t know where to begin.\nEntrepreneurs should break down the tasks to a point where they can produce a reliable estimate. Each key objective should have a clearly defined task or set of tasks. Tasks should be between 8 and 80 person-hours of labor. It is a manageable amount.\nBloom Tools: We ask our teams to prepare an Organization Development Plan that includes at least one and up to three critical objectives tied into key results and broken down into significant activities or tasks. It allows us to understand what the enterprise intends to accomplish during the accelerator period. Additionally, we encourage enterprises to use the Bloom Taskboard to record their daily tasks and keep track of their progress to accomplish what they’ve planned within their set deadlines. \nCommunity: We grow best when we grow together.\nWe rarely grow alone. Being part of an engaging community gives us a sense of belonging. It enables us to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of each other, ourselves, and our environment. Being a part of a community can make us feel like we are a part of something greater than ourselves. Providing unique opportunities for people to learn from each other and support and encouragement are invaluable in joining forces with our peers.\nBloom Tools: We aim to create a healthy community for our enterprises, starting with:\nThe teams: Being part of a community enables us to support other members. Supportive of others will help them feel good and better about themselves. \nThe mentors: An open bond with new connections builds valuable relationships and gives us a more profound sense of belonging. It helps us to reach our goals and brings a sense of security.\nThe module leaders: Communities are rich in resources. Knowing is a unique resource, and through its use, it increases in value. \nWe encourage entrepreneurs to use the inverted pyramid in the context of learning and feedback. First, they evaluate themselves, then get feedback from their mentors, and then the module leaders give feedback. \nThe general architecture of a cycle\nBloom cycles takes the best from agile and design thinking methodologies used at leading innovation companies globally. We use these in our sprint and accelerator programs to help teams develop their startup while learning leading productivity techniques.\nCycle repetitions can include some of the below elements:\nActivities and Reflections\nWeekly activities: Every other Tuesday, the program manager invites the teams to start new training activities and share their progress in the community\nEnd-of-month reflections: At the end of each month, we send the teams a reflection and feedback form to understand and gauge their progress on several KPIs related to the program’s focus. \nLive online events\nTraining sessions: Each cycle will have 2-4 training activities whereby teams will receive resources, including videos, tools, frameworks, and worksheets, to prepare them for the training sessions, where the module leader will facilitate an interactive exchange of knowledge and expertise.\nMentor support: We invite mentors to join a speed mentoring session to facilitate mentor matching. Once we match them, we invite the teams and mentors to set their meeting frequency throughout the accelerator, where they follow up on the enterprise’s progress, approve their budget, help them with their hiring needs, and others as needed.\nTypical Schedule of an Acceleration Program\nCurriculum co-creation and onboarding (1 week, two sessions).\nSession 1: Based on the onboarding sessions, we identify the cohort-based training activities of the accelerator program and present them with the modules they commit to achieving. We will put them in the driver's seat from day one, allowing us to identify standard modules & group them into sessions tackling the same topics in cohort-based activities and individual modules they are interested in tackling separately according to their enterprise needs. We also introduce them to the grant disbursement process and deep dive into best practices to plan their financial journey and ensure they are not delayed.\nSession 2: We invite the teams and mentors to join for a mentor matching session where each team meets at least three mentors. Based on their feedback forms filled at the end of the session, we will facilitate the matching for the duration of the accelerator.\nWeekly training and support (12-16 weeks, 12-16 group training sessions, and two to four individual mentorship sessions per team).\nBased on our program feedback in the last two years, we have adjusted the weekly support to cater to our teams' needs and rhythms. We build a panel of 4-5 trainers who can give general feedback on several modules in our new approach. A trainer joins in every weekly session with up to five teams at once to have enough time for deep discussions. \nDuring the weekly sessions, the teams can share what they’ve learned during the module and discuss their work related to their projects. They will receive feedback from their peers, trainers, and program managers to improve further (inverted feedback pyramid). \nIn addition, teams can book up to 4 follow-up one-on-one meetings with the trainers, mentors, and coaches to deepen the hands-on feedback further, mentoring and coaching experience at the individual and team levels. \nBased on the teams' assessment results, the curriculum will be co-created during the onboarding. After the co-creation sessions, we will select trainers, mentors, and business coaches from our Mentors and Trainers databases.\nDepending on each team’s core priorities, the curriculum might include topics that tackle questions such as \nBranding\nDo we build our brand effectively?\nProblem Solving\nHow strong is our mission?\nHave we identified what value we deliver to our customers with well-defined and aligned products and services?\nSolution Definition\nHave we identified relevant social responsibility factors for our business and industry, and are the social responsibility principles integrated into the overall corporate strategy?\nTarget Market\nHave we clearly defined who we are creating value for and who our most important customers are? \nDo we have clear strategies and channels to reach our customers? \nBasic Revenue Model\nDo we have solid financial plans and clear financial performance indicators?\nAre our revenue streams clearly defined, and how effective is our revenue generation model?\nMilestones and Next Steps\nDo we regularly read and stay on top of global business and industry trends?\nDo we have a coherent organizational strategy, including mission, vision, values, and operational plan?\nTeam\nDo we have diverse and highly skilled staff?\nAre our people (the organization's leadership and staff) satisfied and motivated in their work?\nDo we have a learning culture?\nDo we have the right people and resources (e.g., tools, budget) to provide our products/services?\nWhile some of those topics might already exist in the Bloom Digital Library, we could also commission trainers to develop additional training content if we find a gap that needs to be filled. \nWe send thank you emails to trainers after they complete the cycle to share gratitude.\nAsync accountability on the Bloom platform\nTeams can schedule mentors' sessions at their convenience, tracked on the community of the Bloom platform by posting a reflection on their notes from their mentorship journals. Teams also submit assignments to the community to hold each other responsible and accountable for the module they chose to take at the beginning of the program. Finally, the program manager will encourage the teams to review their peers’ work and give constructive and generous feedback. Indeed by looking at the same challenge from a different perspective, they are encouraged to unlearn and relearn.\nGrant Disbursement Process\nThe Grant Disbursement process will vary slightly depending on the enterprise stage and the grant amount.\nFor earlier-stage enterprises (not registered), the agreement and invoice are with individuals rather than enterprises. \nWe can apply the same basic steps to all programs:\nEnterprises sign the Agreement: \nProgram managers adapt the program agreement template and invite the teams to make a copy.\nTeams complete and sign the agreement by adding a digital signature as an image in the document.\nEnterprises refine the budget:\nThe objectives and key initiatives in the work plan should be related to the budget developed for the grant.\n70-80% of the budget is for capacity building instead of running costs.\nEnterprises get the budget approved:\nEnterprises work on improving it with their mentor and program manager. \nOnce ready and approved, the Mentor + Program manager adds their initials and the date approved on the budget.\nEnterprises get the budget signed:\nThe enterprises sign the budget in the designated cell by uploading a digital signature as an image in the cell.\nThe Program Manager, Finance Officer, and Program Lead sign the budget. \nThe enterprises send us an invoice for the amount (from the Enterprise to AltCity Impact)\nSpecific account information to include in the invoice varies:\nFor programs disbursing from the Lebanon bank account, we include the below:\nAltCity Impact / Bloom\nBeirut, Lebanon\nMOF: 3241751 (Ministry of Finance number)\nEmail: accts@bloom.pm\nDescription: Grant disbursement / Project reference: [Name of the program]\nFor programs disbursing from the UK bank account, we include the below:\nCOMPANY NUMBER: OC442441\nINCORPORATED: 25 May 2022\nREGISTERED OFFICE ADDRESS:\n71-75 Shelton Street\nCovent Garden\nLondon\nWC2H 9JQ\nUNITED KINGDOM\nWe disburse the grant in one tranche for smaller grants (2,000 USD or less).\nTo ensure proper procurement and financial management, we disbursed in 2-3 tranches for larger amounts. \nFor enterprises not yet registered, we will release the second tranche of the grant based on the progress achieved on the objectives set in the organizational development plan.\nFor registered enterprises, after receiving the first tranche, the enterprise sends all the proof of payments (invoices/bills/photos) and an updated variance report that needs to align with the Approved Budget with the next invoice for the next tranche.\nProcurement Process for Registered Enterprises\nThis process applies to registered enterprises receiving grants larger than 2,000 USD.\nPlease watch this video for detailed information: Procurement Process\nQuotations:\n$500 -

Make sure to inform the teams before the session on their pitch duration so that they practice accordingly. The goal is to prevent the moderator from cutting them off publicly, but it is also essential to be strict about keeping to the time limit (possibly with a 10-15 second buffer, max). \nThe presentation order, tables, and list order on any forms should all be numbered and aligned precisely the same way. \nHave the team name, presenter’s name, team members' names, and “presentation number” of the last team on the slide to stay visible to the audience while scoring. Perhaps it could be the team’s title slide with that additional information added. \nHave different staff/team members moderating, time-keeping, making slides/music, etc. Split up roles so nobody is multitasking too much. \nIf technical limitations make it challenging to give the presenters the ability to control the shared screen, have all the teams presenting snap their fingers, so they don’t have to keep saying “next” out loud. \nThe person presenting should turn their video off if the sound is glitchy. Most importantly, their voice and the slides, though seeing them speaking would also be lovely if possible. \nEveryone turns on their microphones at the end to clap for all the teams. :-) Maybe we even do that during the opening “tadaa” to hear everyone’s voice. It is nice to do at the closing of the event as well. \nEncourage teams to present standing up, not sitting down, so they need to set up their laptop (and headphones) in a way that would allow that and not have that be at an awkward angle. \nEncourage all teams to use headphones for better sound quality. \nEncourage all teams to do some warm-up exercises before the presentation. For example, super-hero pose, jumping jacks, stretching, running in place, dance, “coffee breathing,” etc. \nMake things easy for people to switch between Zoom and Remo; create onboarding videos to share with all attendees ahead of time, and encourage them to join Remo / and sign me. \nEncourage teams a week in advance to start inviting their family/friends/future investors.\nAll teams put their username/screen name as “Team Name - Full Name.” \nUse zoom dual monitors > Show participants screen \nEncourage teams to practice, practice, practice! \nHype up the teams! :-) \nSlide Preparation for an Online Demo Day \nHaving a smooth flow between presentations is vital. Having all presentations in one Google Slides presentation can improve the flow substantially. \nIf possible, test ahead of time. You can give participants the ability to control the person sharing the screen. It will allow each speaker to control the slides themselves. However, it often doesn’t work as smoothly in practice because of technical issues, internet delays, or little comfort with the online tools. \nAdvanced Google Docs users can have the teams use separate presentations linked to one master presentation. For example, when copy-pasting from a team presentation into the main presentation, choose “linked slides.” This way, when the teams update their presentations (just those slides), the master presentation is automatically linked.\nTip: Once a presentation is in “present mode,” new changes will not show. It may be best to have an organizer “own” the team’s presentations to remove the team’s ability to edit by a particular deadline. \nHave the team name, presenter’s name, team members' names, and “presentation number” of the last team on the slide to stay visible to the audience while scoring. Perhaps it could be the team’s title slide with that additional information added. \nMake sure all teams send in a recorded pitch video before the session, just in case a team was unable to attend the demo day for any reason (medical, emergency..) or even for reasons such as having terrible internet connection and being unable to connect and join the demo day. Share the folder of “recorded pitch videos” with all the programs team and facilitators.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nOnline demo days can be as effective as in-person. There are different ways to facilitate the event online, and plenty of tools are available to help you make the most of it. \nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nN/A\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nPlanning a Virtual Demo Day: a Careful Balance of Two Worlds\nHow to run a successful inclusive online event - our Demo Day lessons\n\nStage 6: Program Closing, Continual Assessment, and Improvement\nAt the end of the program, we design certificates of completion to the teams and mentors to express our gratitude and appreciation for their support. \nA key challenge area for accelerators measures impact. As yet, an agreed framework for measuring the performance of an accelerator program does not exist, but standard metrics collected and published so far include the following:\nNumber of applications to programs\nNumber of enterprises supported\nFollow-on investment raised by enterprises\nThe survival rate of enterprises\nNumber of employees of enterprises\nNPS of the program\nWe believe that we should pay more attention to defining performance and metrics for success. Unfortunately, as startups, accelerators often lack the time and resources for such measurements, so the impact of accelerator methods is difficult to judge with limited data available. \nHere are some metrics we recommend you track:\nMonthly: For each program, data is collected monthly depending on the KPIs the program manager sets. This could include items such as\nPre and post-assessment results\nOrganization Development Plan progress and status update for each activity\nRevenues\nExpenses\nTraction (most relevant metric per enterprise)\nFeedback on this month’s accelerator activities\nEngagement\nLearning \nInspiration\nComplexity\nRelevance\nPost-Program: Program managers should collect the following data quarterly post-accelerator.\nKPIs\nFinance\nRevenue\nExpenses\nBurn rate & runway.\nCash in the bank\nEBITDA\nTraction\nChurn rate: %, an improvement of % vs. last month.\nCustomer acquisition: $\nCustomer Lifetime Value: $\nOrders per Customer: #\nTime on site before ordering\nTotal user accounts #\nActive users: #\nPaying users: #\nProduct Updates\nchanges in the product strategy, including new versions, UX/UI, new features, platform, etc. \nBusiness Updates\nWhat is relevant about people, office, partners, operations, etc.\nNew hires/fires.\nMarketing strategy.\nNew partnerships.\nInternational expansion plans.\nOperations changes.\nPress updates.\n Funding or Mergers and Acquisitions\nNotable Events\n\nKEY POINTS: \nA key challenge area for accelerators measures impact.

But this isn’t the way that accelerators perceive it. On graduating from an accelerator program, companies are still extremely young, and potentially not yet viable for investment. Everything an accelerator program does is geared toward giving its cohorts the best possible chance of survival after graduation. So it makes sense that most offer post-program support to maintain or enhance startups’ investment viability for as long as possible. \nIt can typically include the following:\nPublic relations opportunities\nConnections with investors\nBoard participation\nHR/recruitment support\nLocal meet-ups\nOnline communities with funding and promotion opportunities\nOffice space\nAlumni Network\nAll accelerators acknowledge their alumni network as a valuable asset of the program: maintaining an alumni database is, therefore, a priority. Some host online communities and alumni events to create and develop the alumni network. Others call on the help of alumni when selecting a new cohort of potential startups. There is also the phenomenon of recycling founders, where startups take in unsuccessful alumni as members of their team if they consider them valuable.\nFollow-on Investment\nAccelerated startups still struggle with gaps between seed funding and successfully raising Series A investment. To help combat this, some accelerators offer to follow–on investment once the program is finished; they can sometimes go some way towards bridging funding gaps. This could be by providing staged investments or an additional capital infusion after graduation.\nMentorship, Perks, and Opportunities\nOnce enterprises are part of an accelerator. They will be part of the community for life. They can expand their business and network with access to a talented group of founders, investors, mentors, and industry leaders. Additionally, the accelerator will typically have onboarded perks partners, providing the enterprises with discounts and access to helpful resources. Finally, keeping in touch with the accelerator community can be beneficial as program managers often share resources, opportunities, and other relevant information.\n\nAppendix\nRunning Hybrid Programs\nWe can think of the acceleration programs in two models: \nThose that run face-to-face, which allow entrepreneurs to meet in a physical space at the same time, and \nThose that are carried out regardless of physical barriers, the time zone, the thousands of kilometers of distance between people, or even complex situations (such as those we have been experiencing in the last years).\nVirtual accelerator programs are growing in popularity and have several advantages for founders and program teams. Virtual programs can also be delivered in a hybrid format, blending both online & offline elements. Virtual and Hybrid Accelerator programs allow\nImproved Flexibility\nOne of the main benefits of hybrid programs is improved flexibility, which is becoming extremely important within the sector. Generally speaking, entrepreneurs want as many options as possible, and the ability to move from in-person to remote can be invaluable. Access to recorded sessions offers a second chance at missed sessions, memory refreshers, and a deeper reflection of session discussions.\nWork with a more significant number of enterprises from much broader geographic areas.\nThe most exciting aspect of hybrid programs for many entrepreneurs is their potential to open up access to learning. On a basic level, when in-person is the only option available, all entrepreneurs need to be within traveling distance of the accelerator throughout the entire duration of their course. However, It is not necessarily the case with hybrid programs, which can mean more people can participate. This will expose the teams to meet people coming from diverse cultural backgrounds. In turn, this will lead to an increased cultural quotient and enhanced collective intelligence exercises. \nSupport your Accelerator community, even during lockdowns\nOne problem we’ve run into in the past is the limited pool of mentors available for any given in-person workshop. Virtual programming has freed us up to engage world-class mentors from anywhere, including mentors that bring enormous technical, business, and market knowledge and speak the language of the startups in our cohort – culturally and literally.\nLeveraging your workshop content to create a reusable library\nE-Learning is no longer a simple byproduct of the information age and Internet access. It’s become an invaluable resource to educators, harnessing a new knowledge-sharing model wherein learners now possess the tools to learn at their own pace. Some online tools allow for quickly creating tests/quizzes, templates, and other resources. Practical benefits include tracking digital assignments’ submissions and reusing or reconstructing a course curriculum using new course templates.\nKEY POINTS: \nHybrid programs allow program managers to work with:\nImproved Flexibility\nA more significant number of enterprises from much broader geographic areas\nSupporting your Accelerator community, even during lockdowns\nLeveraging your workshop content to create a reusable library\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nBloom Digital Library\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nWhat Have We Learned Running Our Acceleration Program Fully Online in the Past 5 Years?\n\nFacilitation for Amazing Online and Offline Experiences\nPeople learn through doing, practicing, and sharing.

Art? Outdoors? Inspiring? A banner with logos? \nSound: Use a better mic if possible, definitely headphones. Make sure nothing is rubbing against the microphone or mic cable while talking. \nAppearance: Try to be as “close to in-person” as possible … What are you wearing? Try not to wear big headphones. \nStand up when talking (it changes body language and energy).\nMute yourself whenever you’re not speaking to avoid interrupting the speaker\nMake sure your Zoom name is adjusted and has your team/organization/role in it as well\"\"\"\n\nHow can we integrate PTG promoting elements into training programs like this?",

      "content": "**Integrating Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) Elements into Bloom Training Programs**\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Bloom Framework is designed to foster personal and organizational growth through accelerator programs that emphasize skill-based and character-based support. By integrating Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) promoting elements into these programs, we can enhance participants' ability to transform adversity into meaningful growth, resilience, and innovation. This integration aligns with Bloom's principles of keeping learners in the driver's seat, focusing on transformation over information, and creating an enabling environment.\n\n---\n\n**Understanding PTG and Its Relevance to Bloom Programs**\n\n**Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)** refers to the positive psychological change experienced as a result of struggling with highly challenging life circumstances. PTG is facilitated through:\n\n1. **Psychoeducation**\n2. **Emotional Regulation**\n3. **Constructive Self-Disclosure**\n4. **Narrative Development**\n5. **Service & Resilient Life Principles**\n\nThese elements can be woven into Bloom's accelerator programs to support entrepreneurs in harnessing their experiences, fostering resilience, and promoting sustainable growth.\n\n---\n\n**Strategies for Integrating PTG Elements**\n\n### **1. Incorporate Psychoeducation into the Curriculum**\n\n**How to Integrate:**\n\n- **Workshops on Resilience and Growth:** Include sessions that educate participants about the concept of PTG, emphasizing that adversity can lead to significant personal and professional development.\n\n- **Stress and Trauma Education:** Offer modules that explain the psychological and physiological responses to stress and trauma, helping participants understand their experiences.\n\n**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n- **Cognitive Reframing:** Helps participants recontextualize challenges as opportunities for growth.\n\n- **Empowerment:** Increases self-efficacy by providing knowledge and tools to navigate adversity.\n\n**Implementation in Bloom Programs:**\n\n- Integrate these workshops during the **Curriculum Co-Creation and Onboarding** stage (Stage 3), ensuring participants are aware of the potential for growth through challenges.\n\n- Align with **Wellbeing & Engagement** assessments by connecting PTG concepts to the PERMAH model dimensions.\n\n### **2. Enhance Emotional Regulation Skills**\n\n**How to Integrate:**\n\n- **Mindfulness and Stress Management Sessions:** Incorporate practices such as mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation.\n\n- **Emotional Intelligence Training:** Develop participants' abilities to recognize, understand, and manage their emotions.\n\n**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n- **Autonomic Regulation:** Helps balance the nervous system, reducing stress responses.\n\n- **Improved Decision-Making:** Emotional regulation leads to clearer thinking and better business decisions.\n\n**Implementation in Bloom Programs:**\n\n- Include these practices during **Weekly Training and Support** (Stage 4), possibly at the beginning of each session to prepare participants mentally.\n\n- Link to **Character Strengths** assessments by encouraging the use of personal strengths in managing emotions.\n\n### **3. Foster Constructive Self-Disclosure**\n\n**How to Integrate:**\n\n- **Peer Support Groups:** Create small, confidential groups where participants can share experiences and challenges.\n\n- **Mentorship Relationships:** Encourage open communication with mentors, emphasizing trust and non-judgmental support.\n\n**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n- **Social Support:** Builds a sense of community and belonging.\n\n- **Validation:** Sharing experiences reduces feelings of isolation and validates personal struggles.\n\n**Implementation in Bloom Programs:**\n\n- During **Mentor Engagement** (Stage 0) and **Mentor Support** sessions (Stage 4), train mentors in active listening and empathetic communication.\n\n- Use **Community Platforms** to facilitate safe sharing among participants.\n\n### **4. Promote Narrative Development**\n\n**How to Integrate:**\n\n- **Storytelling Workshops:** Guide participants in crafting their personal and entrepreneurial narratives, highlighting growth and learning from challenges.\n\n- **Reflective Journaling:** Encourage regular writing to process experiences and track progress.\n\n**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n- **Meaning-Making:** Helps participants integrate their experiences into a coherent story, enhancing self-understanding.\n\n- **Identity Formation:** Strengthens personal and professional identity aligned with growth.\n\n**Implementation in Bloom Programs:**\n\n- Incorporate storytelling exercises during **Sprint/Bootcamp Sessions** (Stage 2) and **Weekly Training** (Stage 4).\n\n- Utilize **Bloom Digital Library** resources to provide prompts and frameworks for narrative development.\n\n### **5. Encourage Acts of Kindness and Service**\n\n**How to Integrate:**\n\n- **Community Service Projects:** Organize opportunities for participants to engage in social impact activities related to their ventures.\n\n- **Peer Mentoring:** Facilitate opportunities for participants to support each other's development.\n\n**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n- **Altruism:** Promotes positive emotions and a sense of purpose.\n\n- **Networking:** Builds stronger relationships within the cohort.\n\n**Implementation in Bloom Programs:**\n\n- Align with the **Impact Areas** defined during **Program Design** (Stage 0).\n\n- Incorporate service-oriented objectives in the **Organization Development Plan** (Stage 2 and 3).\n\n### **6.

Gratitude Moderates the Mediating Effect of Deliberate Rumination on the Relationship Between Intrusive Rumination and Post-traumatic Growth\n \\r\\nEunseung KimEunseung Kim1Sungman Bae*Sungman Bae2*\n1Department of Psychology, Dankook University, Cheonan, South Korea\n2Department of Psychology and Psychotherapy, College of Health Sciences, Dankook University, Cheonan, South Korea\nPurpose: This study examines the moderating effect of gratitude on the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and post-traumatic growth (PTG).\n\nMethods: We used self-report questionnaires to collect data from 450 18–68-year-old participants (Mage = 39.73, SD = 13.73) residing in major cities and regions across South Korea. Data that were collected from 411 participants were subjected to analysis. Version 25 of SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) and PROCESS macro were used to analyze mediation, moderation, and moderated mediation effects.\n\nResults: Deliberate rumination mediated the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG. Gratitude moderated the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG. Finally, gratitude moderated the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG.\n\nConclusion: Deliberate rumination and gratitude facilitate PTG for traumatized adults. In particular, gratitude reinforces the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG.\n\nIntroduction\nNationwide surveys indicate that 71.9% of Korean (Seo et al., 2012) adults and 89% of American adults (Kilpatrick et al., 2013) experience at least one traumatic experience during their lifetime. Traumatic events can cause serious psychological problems (Christopher, 2004), and approximately 10–15% of those who experience trauma are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (Green and Lindy, 1994).\n\nWhile past studies have focused on clinical symptoms (e.g., reexperiencing symptoms, hyperarousal) that result from the experience of a traumatic event, recent research has begun to focus on positive changes and growth that occur after a traumatic experience (Joseph et al., 1993; Nerken, 1993; Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1995). Indeed, researchers have found that PTG can occur after exposure to various types of traumatic events such as bereavement (Taku et al., 2008), cancer (Cormio et al., 2017), physical violence (Kleim and Ehlers, 2009), and traffic accidents (Nishi et al., 2010).\n\nPost-traumatic growth refers to the positive changes and growth that occur as a result of experiencing trauma (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004). PTG can lead to an enhanced sense of personal strength, changes in one’s perspective toward life, and improved interpersonal relationships. Some individuals experience positive changes and growth after trauma, although others experience intrusive symptoms such as nightmares, hypo/hyperarousal, depression, and negative changes in cognition and mood. Persistent depression is linked to worse outcomes such as maladaptive coping and maladjustment (Ghio et al., 2015).\n\nWhy do some people experience PTG? According to previous studies, factors related to PTG can be classified into three categories: the characteristics of the event, personal characteristics, and cognitive processing of the traumatic experience (Calhoun et al., 2000; Linley and Joseph, 2004; Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004; Kim and Lee, 2016). In particular, many researchers have focused on the ways in which individuals cognitively process a traumatic event (e.g., intrusive and deliberate rumination).\n\nRumination plays a key role in the process of PTG and is divided into two categories: intrusive and deliberate rumination (Calhoun and Tedeschi, 2006). Intrusive rumination is a process by which one automatically reexperiences images, emotions, and thoughts that are related to an event. On the other hand, deliberate rumination refers to an intentional thought process through which one attempts to understand the cause and meaning of an incident. After a traumatic event, affected individuals may experience intrusive rumination and extreme emotional distress, but they may also simultaneously attempt to engage in deliberate rumination to alleviate psychological distress (Wu et al., 2015; Zhou and Wu, 2015; Zhang et al., 2018).\n\nDeliberate rumination can facilitate the expansion of existing schemas and help one better understand a traumatic experience (Triplett et al., 2012). An individual’s beliefs and values may be changed and enriched through the process of deliberate rumination, and this in turn may promote PTG. PTG can lead to various positive changes such as an increased appreciation of life and self-understanding as well as changes in life priorities (Calhoun et al., 2010).\n\nTedeschi and Calhoun (1996, 2004) noted that the process of PTG occurs across several stages. Individuals possess a schema that corresponds to a cognitive framework of the self, others, and the world. After traumatic events, affected individuals experience distortions of their belief systems, and intrusive rumination is activated in response to extreme psychological stress (Zhou and Wu, 2015; Zhang et al., 2018). However, intrusive thoughts may activate deliberate rumination, which may help individuals better understand their traumatic experience and rebuild a new schema (Triplett et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2016; Gwak and Park, 2018).\n\nDeliberate rumination is an attempt to accommodate trauma into one’s cognitive schema. It is an active cognitive process that involves reconstructing an existing schema to promote PTG. The effects of deliberate rumination on PTG have been demonstrated in the literature (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004, Calhoun and Tedeschi, 2006), and higher levels of deliberate rumination have been found to be associated with greater PTG (Linley and Joseph, 2004; Taku et al., 2008; Triplett et al., 2012; Zhou and Wu, 2015; Cárdenas et al., 2019). In particular, Triplett et al. (2012) found that deliberate rumination mediates the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG.\n\nGratitude has been identified as a factor that promotes PTG. Gratitude refers to an attitude of thankfulness and joy for the benefits and blessings that one has received from other people and nature (Emmons and Shelton, 2002). Adler and Fagley (2005) noted that gratitude involves “noticing and acknowledging its value and meaning of something—an event, behavior, object—and feeling a positive emotional connection to it.” Gratitude includes cognitive, emotional, and behavioral factors (McCullough et al., 2001; Watkins et al., 2003; Adler and Fagley, 2005) and is an attribution-dependent characteristic (Weiner, 1985) that allows one to perceive the benefits that have been gained from others and various life experiences (Emmons, 2007). Gratitude consists of an appreciation of others and various aspects of daily life and the ability to recall positive past experiences (Watkins et al., 2003).\n\nA recent meta-analytic study found that gratitude is a significant predictor of PTG (Jang and Kim, 2017). Recent studies have also shown that gratitude moderates the effect of post-traumatic stress on PTG (Vieselmeyer et al., 2017; Leppma et al., 2018). Highly grateful individuals tend to be more likely to appreciate everyday events (McCullough et al., 2002), which in turn can facilitate adaptive coping (Fredrickson, 2004). Such individuals experience gratitude more frequently in daily life and across a wider array of circumstances compared to those with lower levels of gratitude. Further, experiences of gratitude in the midst of trauma may be significant because gratitude not only inspires and transforms individuals, it also offers meaning in life by helping people interpret their life as a gift. Gratefulness may also have long-term survival benefits by making people more open-minded and flexible, ultimately allowing them to better perceive and take advantage of opportunities, which in turn can facilitate adaptive coping (Johnson and Fredrickson, 2005). Past studies have also shown that gratitude promotes deliberate rumination, which promotes PTG (Wood et al., 2010; Zhou and Wu, 2015; Kim and Lee, 2016).\n\nIn particular, Zhou and Wu (2015) longitudinally examined the relationship between gratitude, deliberate rumination, and PTG among people who had experienced an earthquake. Specifically, the participants were assessed three and a half years (T1), four and a half years (T2), and five and a half years (T3) after the earthquake. The results showed that gratitude predicted PTG from T2 and T3. This result indicates that gratitude is a stable predictor of PTG. Additionally, gratitude at T1 predicted PTG at T3 through deliberate rumination at T2.\n\nIn summary, the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG has been established in the literature. In the present study, gratitude was expected to moderate the relationship between deliberate rumination and PTG. Accordingly, five research hypotheses were formulated (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1\n www.frontiersin.org\nFigure 1. Hypothetical Model.\n\nHypothesis 1: Intrusive rumination will be negatively related to PTG.\nHypotheses 2: Deliberate rumination will mediate the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG.\nHypothesis 3: Gratitude will be positively related to PTG.\nHypothesis 4: Gratitude will moderate the relationship between deliberate rumination and PTG.\nHypothesis 5: The mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG will be moderated by gratitude.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Procedures\nParticipants in this study were recruited from community centers in major cities and regions across South Korea. Trained investigators (e.g., psychology graduate students) provided participants with a detailed introduction to the study. All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and signed a consent form before completing the questionnaires. After the participants completed the questionnaires, they were compensated. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Dankook University.\n\nThis study was conducted among 450 adults with an age range of 19–68 years; the mean age of participants was 39.73 years (SD = 13.73). The sample consisted of 245 women (59.6%) and 166 men (40.4%). The age distribution of the participants was as follows: 123 (29.9%), 98 (23.8%), 83 (20.2%), 69 (16.8%), and 38 (9.2%) participants were in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, respectively. Further, 155 (37.7%), 105 (25.3%), 56 (10.6%), 41 (10.0%), and 53 (12.9%) participants were college, graduate school, university, professional college, and high school graduates, respectively; 0.5% had no educational experience. Additionally, 230 (56%) and 163 (36.7%) participants were married and unmarried, respectively (Table 1). Finally, using Allen’s (2005) categorization of trauma into three types – interpersonal, impersonal, and interpersonal related trauma – 143 (34.8%) participants of this study experienced interpersonal trauma inflicted by human perpetrators (e.g., physical or sexual abuse), 146 (35.5%) experienced impersonal trauma caused by human or natural origins (e.g., accidents or natural disasters), and 122 (29.7%) experienced interpersonal related trauma (e.g., death of a partner, severe illness).\n\nTable 1\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 1. Demographic Information.\n\nMeasures\nTrauma Experience Questionnaire\nIn the present study, the Trauma Experience Questionnaire, which was developed by Song et al. (2009) and revised by Shin and Chung (2012), was used to obtain information about traumatic events participants had experienced (e.g., type, duration, and severity of the traumatic event). The questionnaire contained seven items. Participants were asked to disclose the most painful traumatic event that they had experienced and to categorize the type of the event. They were then instructed to respond to the items of the assessment based on the aforementioned event. They reported whether they experienced psychological pain and scored the severity of the subjective pain that they had experienced at the time of the event and more recently on a scale of 1–7 (1 = no pain; 7 = very painful).\n\nKorean Version of the Event-Related Rumination Inventory\nThe Korean version of the Event-Related Rumination Inventory was developed by Cann et al. (2011) and revised by Ahn et al. (2013). The scale consists of 20 items that assess intrusive and deliberate rumination using a 4-point Likert scale (0 = not at all; 3 = always). A few examples of items that assess intrusive rumination are as follows: “Thoughts, memories, or images of the event came to mind even when I did not want them” and “I could not keep images or thoughts about the event from entering my mind.” A few examples of items that assess deliberate rumination are as follows: “I thought about whether I could find meaning from my experience,” “I thought about the event and tried to understand what happened,” and “I deliberately thought about how the event had affected me.” In the present study, the Cronbach’s alphas of the intrusive and deliberate rumination subscales were 0.93 and 0.91, respectively.\n\nKorean Version of the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory\nThe Korean version of the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory that was developed by Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) and validated by Song et al. (2009) was used to measure individual perceptions of positive changes after a traumatic experience. The scale consists of 21 items with four subscales: relating to others, new possibilities, personal strength, and spiritual change. For each of the subscales, responses are recorded on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = no change; 5 = very high degree of change). Higher total scores are indicative of greater PTG. The following are representative scale items: “I changed my priorities about what is important in my life,” “I established a new path for my life,” and “I am more likely to try to change things that need changing.” The Cronbach’s alpha of this scale was 0.94 in the present study.\n\nKorean Version of the Gratitude Questionnaire\nWe used the Korean version of the Gratitude Questionnaire that was developed by McCullough et al. (2002) and validated by Kwon et al. (2006). It measures the intensity, frequency, extent, and density of gratitude, consisting of 6 items that require responses to be recorded on a 7-point Likert scale (0 = strongly disagree; 6 = strongly agree). The following are representative scale items: “I have so much in life to be thankful for” and “As I get older, I find myself better able to appreciate the people, events, and situations that have been part of my life.” Two items are reverse-scored, and higher total scores are indicative of greater gratitude. The Cronbach’s alpha of this scale was 0.89 in the present study.\n\nData Analysis\nVersion 25.0 of SPSS and PROCESS macro 2.16 for SPSS (Hayes, 2013) were used to test the research hypotheses. First, frequencies and descriptive statistics were computed to examine the demographic characteristics of the sample, and Pearson’s correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between the study variables. Second, model 4 of PROCESS macro for SPSS was used to examine the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG (Zhao et al., 2010; Rucker et al., 2011). Next, a bootstrap test was conducted and the resultant 95% confidence intervals were inspected to examine the significance of the indirect effects that resulted from mediation analysis (Preacher et al., 2007).\n\nModel 1 of PROCESS macro for SPSS was used to examine the moderating effect of gratitude on the relationship between deliberate rumination and PTG. Additionally, simple regression was conducted to examine the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG as a function of the level of gratitude (i.e., high vs. low). Finally, model 14 of PROCESS macro for SPSS was used to examine whether gratitude moderates the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG.\n\nResults\nCorrelation Analysis\nEmergent correlations between the study variables are shown in Table 2. Intrusive rumination correlated positively with deliberate rumination (r = 0.36, p < 0.01) and negatively with gratitude (r = −0.29, p < 0.01). On the other hand, deliberate rumination was unrelated to PTG. Deliberate rumination correlated positively with PTG (r = 0.36, p < 0.01) but was unrelated to gratitude. Finally, there was a positive correlation (r = 0.45, p < 0.01) between gratitude and PTG.\n\nTable 2\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 2. Correlations, mean, and standard deviation among variables (N = 411).\n\nThe Mediating Effect of Deliberate Rumination on the Relationship Between Intrusive Rumination and PTG\nThe mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG was examined (Table 3). Intrusive rumination had a negative effect on PTG (B = 0.60, t = −3.80, p < 0.001) and a positive effect on deliberate rumination (B = 0.37, t = 7.91, p < 0.001). Deliberate rumination had a positive effect on PTG (B = 1.36, t = 8.77, p < 0.001). In addition, the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG was statistically significant (95% confidence interval = 0.36, 0.67) (Table 4).\n\nTable 3\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 3. Mediating effects of deliberate rumination in relationship between intrusive rumination and post-traumatic growth).\n\nTable 4\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 4. Indirect effects on post-traumatic growth (Bootstrapping).\n\nThe Moderating Effect of Gratitude on the Relationship Between Deliberate Rumination and PTG\nThe moderating effect of gratitude was examined by entering deliberate rumination, gratitude, and their interaction terms (i.e., deliberate rumination × gratitude) into the model. Table 5 shows the results of the analysis that was conducted to examine the moderating effect of gratitude on the relationship between deliberate rumination and PTG.\n\nTable 5\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 5. The moderating effects of gratitude on the relationship between intentional rumination and post-traumatic growth).\n\nThe main effects of deliberate rumination (B = 1.12, t = 8.55, p < 0.001) and gratitude (B = 1.61, t = 10.27, p < 0.001) as well as their interaction effect (i.e., deliberate rumination × gratitude) (B = −0.04, t = −2.10, p < 0.05) were statistically significant. Simple regression analysis was conducted to examine the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG as a function of the level of gratitude (Table 6). The results revealed that the 95% confidence intervals did not include a 0. In other words, the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG differed between individuals who reported low (i.e., M − 1 SD) and high (i.e., M + 1 SD) levels of gratitude (Figure 2). Gratitude reinforced the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG.\n\nTable 6\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 6. Conditional indirect effect at specific levels of the gratitude when deliberate rumination as a mediator.\n\nFigure 2\n www.frontiersin.org\nFigure 2. Gratitude moderated the relationship between deliberated rumination and post-traumatic growth.\n\nThe Moderating Effect of Gratitude on the Mediating Effect of Deliberate Rumination on the Relationship Between Intrusive Rumination and PTG\nTable 7 shows the results of the analysis that was conducted to examine the moderating effect of gratitude on the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG. The direct effect of intrusive rumination on PTG was not significant (B = −0.18, t = −1.19, p = 0.23). However, deliberate rumination had a positive effect on PTG (B = 1.17, t = 3.88, p < 0.001), the interaction term (deliberate rumination × gratitude) (B = −0.04, t = −2.25, p < 0.05) was significant, and the index of the moderated mediation effect was significant (95% confidence interval = −0.033, −0.002) (Figure 3). Further, Table 8 shows the results of the bootstrap test, which revealed the conditional indirect effect of gratitude. The 95% confidence intervals did not include a 0. In other words, the moderating effect of gratitude through deliberate rumination on PTG differed for individuals who reported low (i.e., M − 1 SD), average (i.e., mean), and high (i.e., M + 1 SD) levels of gratitude.\n\nTable 7\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 7. Moderated mediation effects of gratitude on the relationship between intrusive rumination, deliberate rumination, and post-traumatic growth.\n\nFigure 3\n www.frontiersin.org\nFigure 3.

Conditional indirect effect of gratitude when deliberate rumination mediated between intrusive rumination and post-traumatic growth.\n\nDiscussion\nThe major findings of the present study are discussed in this section. The previously observed mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG was verified. Intrusive rumination facilitated PTG by promoting deliberate rumination (Taku et al., 2008; Triplett et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015). These results are consistent with past findings that post-traumatic intrusive rumination stimulates deliberate rumination, which in turn promotes PTG (Triplett et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2016; Zhou and Wu, 2016; Zhang et al., 2018).\n\nThe results of this study support the PTG model that was proposed by Tedeschi and Calhoun (2004). According to this model, deliberate rumination plays a key role in the PTG process. Many individuals experience intrusive rumination after traumatic events (Scarpa et al., 2009), and intrusive rumination can activate deliberate rumination. Persistent intrusive rumination can adversely impact PTG and is likely to cause post-traumatic stress disorder (Triplett et al., 2012). In particular, deliberate rumination can help one reconstruct an incident and correct dysfunctional beliefs about a traumatic event (Seo and Chae, 2006).\n\nSecond, in the present study, gratitude had a positive impact on PTG, and deliberate rumination and gratitude had an interaction effect on PTG. These results concur with past findings that the influence of deliberate rumination on PTG is strengthened by high levels of gratitude (Zhou and Wu, 2015; Kim and Lee, 2016). This suggests that the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG is reinforced by gratitude.\n\nPast studies have only examined the direct relationship between gratitude and PTG. In this regard, the present findings further our understanding of the specific role that gratitude plays in PTG by delineating the moderating effect of gratitude on the relationship between deliberate rumination and PTG. Gratitude can alter the perspectives from which traumatic experiences are interpreted (Watkins, 2014). Highly grateful individuals tend to find positive resources in their lives after a traumatic event and perceive themselves and their environments positively (Fredrickson, 2004). In other words, gratitude can help individuals find new meaning and value after a traumatic experience and accept painful experiences as a part of their lives.\n\nOne of the key findings of this study pertains to the moderating effect of gratitude on the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG. This result is consistent with past findings that highly grateful individuals experience greater PTG as a result of their cognitive efforts to understand a traumatic event (McCullough et al., 2006; Chun and Lee, 2013; Watkins, 2014). This suggests that the impact of deliberate rumination on PTG varies as a function of the level of gratitude. In this regard, gratitude can activate deliberate rumination and act as a buffer against the psychological distress that is caused by intrusive thoughts (Tsai et al., 2016; Leppma et al., 2018).\n\nThis study makes several contributions to the literature. First, past studies that have examined the impact of gratitude on PTG have been conducted using developmentally homogeneous samples such as adolescents and middle-aged adults. However, in this study, we used a heterogeneous sample of participants who represented all the developmental stages ranging from youth to older adulthood. This enhances the generalizability of the observed effect of gratitude on PTG to people of all ages. Second, the association between the gratitude and PTG has been observed in previous studies, but the moderating effect of gratitude on PTG has not been clearly delineated. In addition, there has been a lack of understanding about how deliberate rumination contributes to PTG. In this study, we have delineated the moderating effect that gratitude has on the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG.\n\nThe present findings have clinical implications. Specifically, therapists must be informed that repetitive and intrusive thoughts are natural reactions to a traumatic event and that traumatized individuals do not need to excessively suppress or avoid thoughts about their traumatic experience. In addition, it is necessary to implement training and intervention programs that can help individuals engage in deliberate rather than intrusive rumination. In particular, the present finding that gratitude enhances the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG suggests that psychological interventions should aim to promote gratitude among traumatized individuals (e.g., gratitude writing).\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, self-report measures were used to collect data in the present study; thus, future studies should use behavioral observations and the reports of family members and acquaintances to measure the study variables. Second, as this study used a cross-sectional research design, inferences cannot be drawn about the causality of emergent relationships. Future studies should use a longitudinal research design to test the validity of the present findings. Third, we did not distinguish between different types of trauma and the period after trauma occurrence; we weighed all traumatic experiences equally, although research suggests that different types of trauma and the period after occurrence might differently influence PTG.\n\nDespite its limitations, this is the first study to assess the moderating effect of gratitude on the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG. These findings shed light on how and when gratitude is associated with PTG via deliberate rumination. Further, this study provides grounds for gratitude interventions for adults who have experienced trauma to facilitate growth. It also implies that in the midst of distress, those who have experienced trauma may be able to consider their life more meaningful through gratitude.\n",

      "content": "**Integrating Gratitude into Training Programs to Enhance Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)**\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**\n\nRecent research has expanded our understanding of the factors that facilitate Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG). The study titled \"Gratitude Moderates the Mediating Effect of Deliberate Rumination on the Relationship Between Intrusive Rumination and Post-Traumatic Growth\" by Kim and Bae (Year) provides valuable insights into how gratitude can enhance PTG.

Incorporate Gratitude into Psychoeducation**\n\n- **Mechanism of Action:**\n  - Educating participants about the role of gratitude in facilitating PTG enhances awareness.\n  - Understanding the benefits of gratitude can motivate participants to engage in gratitude practices.\n\n- **Implementation:**\n  - Include modules on the science of gratitude and its impact on mental health and growth.\n  - Use examples and case studies demonstrating how gratitude fosters PTG.\n\n**2. Enhance Emotional Regulation Through Gratitude**\n\n- **Mechanism of Action:**\n  - Gratitude practices reduce stress and promote positive emotions.\n  - Helps shift focus from distressing thoughts to appreciative ones.\n\n- **Implementation:**\n  - Introduce gratitude-based mindfulness exercises.\n  - Encourage daily reflection on things participants are grateful for.\n\n**3. Facilitate Constructive Self-Disclosure with Gratitude**\n\n- **Mechanism of Action:**\n  - Sharing feelings of gratitude can deepen connections and trust among participants.\n  - Promotes a positive group atmosphere conducive to open sharing.\n\n- **Implementation:**\n  - Incorporate group activities where participants share gratitude stories.\n  - Use prompts that encourage expressing appreciation for support received.\n\n**4. Integrate Gratitude into Narrative Development**\n\n- **Mechanism of Action:**\n  - Gratitude reframes personal narratives to highlight positive aspects and growth.\n  - Helps in constructing a balanced story that acknowledges both trauma and subsequent growth.\n\n- **Implementation:**\n  - Guide participants to identify positive outcomes or lessons learned from their experiences.\n  - Use journaling exercises focusing on gratitude in personal narratives.\n\n**5. Encourage Acts of Kindness and Service Rooted in Gratitude**\n\n- **Mechanism of Action:**\n  - Expressing gratitude through helping others reinforces positive emotions and PTG.\n  - Enhances a sense of purpose and connectedness.\n\n- **Implementation:**\n  - Organize community service projects as expressions of gratitude.\n  - Encourage participants to mentor others who have faced similar challenges.\n\n---\n\n**Practical Applications in Training Programs**\n\n**Methodologies to Incorporate Gratitude:**\n\n1. **Gratitude Journaling:**\n\n   - **Activity:** Participants write daily entries about things they are grateful for.\n   - **Mechanism:** Enhances positive emotions and shifts focus from intrusive thoughts to appreciation.\n\n2. **Gratitude Letters and Visits:**\n\n   - **Activity:** Writing letters to people they are grateful to and, if possible, delivering them in person.\n   - **Mechanism:** Strengthens social bonds and promotes positive emotional experiences.\n\n3. **Group Gratitude Exercises:**\n\n   - **Activity:** Sharing gratitude statements in group settings.\n   - **Mechanism:** Fosters a supportive community and encourages mutual appreciation.\n\n4. **Mindfulness-Based Gratitude Meditation:**\n\n   - **Activity:** Guided meditations focusing on feelings of gratitude.\n   - **Mechanism:** Reduces stress and promotes emotional regulation.\n\n5. **Gratitude in Narrative Reconstruction:**\n\n   - **Activity:** Integrating elements of gratitude into personal storytelling.\n   - **Mechanism:** Helps reframe traumatic experiences to include positive growth aspects.\n\n**Implementing in Bloom Training Programs:**\n\n- **During Onboarding and Curriculum Design:**\n  - Introduce gratitude as a core component of the program.\n  - Assess participants' baseline levels of gratitude using validated scales.\n\n- **In Weekly Training and Support Sessions:**\n  - Begin sessions with gratitude practices to set a positive tone.\n  - Encourage sharing of gratitude experiences related to their entrepreneurial journey.\n\n- **Through Mentorship Engagement:**\n  - Train mentors to incorporate gratitude discussions in their interactions.\n  - Use gratitude to reinforce mentees' progress and efforts.\n\n- **In Reflection and Feedback Processes:**\n  - Include gratitude-focused questions in reflection forms.\n  - Highlight growth and positive changes during feedback.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe integration of gratitude into training programs is supported by empirical evidence demonstrating its role in enhancing PTG.

SPSS (23 version) and PROCESS (3.3 version) were used for correlation analyses, mediation analysis, and moderated mediation analysis.\n\nResults: (1) PTG was positively correlated with creativity, self-efficacy, and deliberate rumination. Creativity was positively correlated with self-efficacy and deliberate rumination. Deliberate rumination was positively correlated with self-efficacy. (2) Self-efficacy mediated the relationship between PTG and creativity. (3) Deliberate rumination moderated the second half of the path of “PTG → self-efficacy → creativity.”\n\nConclusions: PTG affected creativity directly and also indirectly through self-efficacy. In particular, deliberate rumination moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and creativity, such that the association was stronger when the incidence of deliberate rumination was low. These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the positive link between PTG and creativity.\n\nIntroduction\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly and widely worldwide, which had a significant impact on people’s lives (Zhao et al., 2020). For example, a sample survey and analysis of 17,865 posts of active Weibo users found that people’s sensitivity to social risks increased and their life satisfaction decreased during the pandemic (Li et al., 2020). Pandemics and government-mandated measures of quarantine and isolation defined as lockdown have an impact on mental health of general population (Brooks et al., 2020). People suffered from depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress, addiction symptoms, and the persistence of avoidance behaviors due to infection fears, reduced social activities, loss of accessibility to basic necessities, and financial loss during the pandemics (Brooks et al., 2020; Rossi et al., 2020; Grignoli et al., 2021). During the COVID-19 pandemic, a study of 1,210 respondents in China showed that 84.7% spent 20–24 h per day at home and experienced the rates of moderate to severe depression and anxiety of 16.5 and 28.8%, respectively (Wang et al., 2020). In addition, the relatives of COVID-19 patients suffered from high levels of anxiety due to feelings of insecurity and loss of a sense of control (Dorman-Ilan et al., 2020). Most Italian residents had higher levels of distress because of positive cases nearby, the prolonged lockdown and having to relocate (Di Giuseppe et al., 2020). At the same time, people face enormous stressors and spend more time fantasizing, which is an addictive mental behavior associated with psychological dysfunctions (Somer et al., 2020). In summary, individuals have been exposed to varying degrees of threat of injury or death, resulting in numerous psychological problems and instances of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the pandemic (Yehuda, 2002; Sun et al., 2020). Therefore, it is essential to understand people’s automatic coping mechanisms in order to respond effectively to the intense stress caused by a pandemic (Di Giuseppe et al., 2020).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also posed a threat to the physical and mental health of Chinese college students, and this has attracted extensive attention from society and academia. Many universities have taken precautionary measures such as closing campuses, postponing internships, and changing to e-learning. College students have generally been anxious because of multiple pressures from the pandemic, their studies and their employment (Cao et al., 2020). For example, a cross-sectional study showed that 50.09% of college students from Guangdong Province, China, reported symptoms of stress (Li X. et al., 2020). A similar study found that the prevalence of mental disorders among 11,954 Chinese college students was as high as 22.8%, and that the stress caused by uncertainty was a risk factor for mental disorders during the pandemic (Wu et al., 2020). In the face of such a devastating public health event, it is necessary to attend to the mental health status of college students and to intervene effectively to improve their ability to avoid mental disorders.\n\nA number of empirical studies have examined the positive effects that traumatic events can have on people (Linley and Joseph, 2004). Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996), in their scientific measurement of the phenomenon of psychological growth after traumatic events, proposed the term post-traumatic growth (PTG) to describe the process by which people re-evaluate traumatic events in order to better understand themselves, others, and the world as they actively adapt to challenging circumstances.\n\nAlthough some college students from China suffered from PTSD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, they also sought effective ways to adapt to trauma and adversity (Chi et al., 2020). Researchers have pointed out that PTG is positively correlated with PTSD symptoms (Shakespeare-Finch and Lurie-Beck, 2014; Liu et al., 2016) and that both positive and negative outcomes of traumatic events may occur simultaneously. In the short and long post-traumatic period, PTG can be used as a strategy to alleviate PTSD or as an outcome to be transformed by PTSD (Wu et al., 2018). Furthermore, negative emotions and cognitive deficits caused by traumatic events may impair an individual’s creativity development (Benedek et al., 2014). However, a study that focused on 92 outstanding literary scholars from the Tang and Song dynasties in China showed that an adverse environment can be an important factor in the achievement of highly successful creatives (Yi et al., 2017). Trauma and adversity are conceptually similar in that both involve experiences that are destructive or antagonistic to the individual (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). When individuals use various strategies to solve problems in the face of adversity, cognitive flexibility is likely to increase and provide motivation and opportunities for the development of creativity. Then individuals who experience PTG are able to face traumatic events and life challenges with more positive moods, which will foster creative ideas (Han et al., 2019). Thus, trauma is closely linked to creativity, but until now there exists little empirical research examining this association (Liang et al., 2020). In addition, previous studies focused on only outstanding individuals (Simonton, 1994; Niu and Kaufman, 2005), but few studies have investigated the general population. The relationship between ordinary people’s trauma and creativity is also an important issue.\n\nResearch shows that the positive changes generated by PTG include interpersonal relationship, personal strength, mental state, attitude toward life, etc. (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004). These positive changes can help individuals to adopt more proactive thinking and coping styles when they experience new negative events. Therefore, we speculate that individuals who experience PTG can improve their general self-efficacy. Though the development of creativity may be a manifestation of PTG, it is also influenced by other factors. Studies have demonstrated that individual self-efficacy is a positive predictor of creativity (Jaiswal and Dhar, 2016; Newman et al., 2018). However, it is worth exploring whether self-efficacy can have a positive impact on the creativity of college students in the face of the immense mental stress caused by their social isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak (Chi et al., 2020).\n\nFurthermore, stressors associated with COVID-19 activated individuals’ rumination mechanisms, which may have an impact on individual creativity. It has been shown that a higher frequency of rumination during the pandemic resulted in more negative emotions and decreased cognitive function (Newman et al., 2018; Ye et al., 2020), which is detrimental to the development of creative thinking. However, individuals can also increase their self-confidence by recalling positive examples through rumination (Bandura, 1997). At the same time, creative ideas and material from life can be obtained through rumination (Forgeard et al., 2020). It has been shown that intrusive rumination is positively correlated with creativity (Wang et al., 2021) and that intrusive rumination may promote deliberate rumination (Kamijo and Yukawa, 2018). Deliberate rumination indicates that individuals cognitively revisit events, reframe and recover their core beliefs, and feel positive changes in several aspects of their lives (Cann et al., 2011). When individuals face traumatic events, high self-efficacy can promote individuals to be more likely to actively recognize and reflect on the problem under the influence of the consciousness of “I can,” that is, to realize deliberate rumination (Andersson et al., 2014). However, there are few researches on the influence of deliberate rumination on the relationship between general self-efficacy and creativity (Binnewies et al., 2009). Thus, deliberate rumination deserves attention as an important factor influencing individual mental health and cognitive development.\n\nIn order to enhance the understanding of the changes in creativity of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study explored the relationship between PTG and creativity among college students during that period as well as the mediating role of self-efficacy and the moderating role of deliberate rumination. In the following section, the definitions of these four variables and the relationships between them are presented.\n\nTheoretical Basis and Hypothesis\nRelationship Between PTG and Creativity\nPTG refers to the positive psychological changes brought about by an individual’s struggle with traumatic events, which does not mean a reduction in the level of psychological distress; rather, the two often coexist (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004). It is commonly assessed using indicators such as “new possibilities, relating to others, personal strength, spiritual change, and appreciation of life” (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1996). Recently, many studies have focused on the predictors of and influences on PTG. For example, it has been shown that optimism, social support, and appropriate cognitive strategies contribute to PTG (Baillie et al., 2014; Pérez-San-Gregorio et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2020). In addition, a number of scholars and practitioners have empirically confirmed the mechanisms of action when different traumatic events have a positive impact on people such as cancer (Sharp et al., 2018), burns (Wiechman Askay and Magyar-Russell, 2009), sexual assault (Frazier et al., 2001), earthquakes (Alamdar et al., 2020), and the death of a loved one (Büchi et al., 2007). Although the possible positive effects of traumatic events have been demonstrated in practice, the exact nature of the predictors and consequences of PTG remain inconclusive (Blackie and Jayawickreme, 2014; Groarke et al., 2017).\n\nGuilford (1950) defined the term creativity as a process of thought and action that produces new and original works, emphasizing the originality and effectiveness of creativity (Runco and Jaeger, 2012). Rhodes (1961) proposed the 4Ps creativity model, which integrates the different aspects of creativity, including person, process, product and process. In the field of social psychological research, Amabile (1988) developed a model of the components of creativity that comprised cognitive, personality, motivational, and social factors including domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant skills and task motivation. Later, Amabile (1996) revised the model to take into account the working environment. Sternberg and Lubart (1991) developed creativity investment theory, which states that creativity is related to six factors associated with the individual’s psychological mechanisms and environment: intellectual abilities, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Plucker et al. (2004, p. 90), after reviewing 90 articles from high-impact journals, suggested that “creativity is the interaction among aptitude, process, and environment by which an individual or group produces a perceptible product that is both novel and useful as defined within a social context.” However, there is currently no agreed definition of creativity (Treffinger, 2009).\n\nCreativity is an important part of cognitive, social, and emotional activity, and it is often defined in terms of creative products, but creative ideas can also be quantified as creative products, and focusing on the ideas people generate is particularly useful for understanding “everyday creativity” (Runco et al., 2000). The Runco Ideational Behavior Scale, for example, measures creative potential by asking individuals to rate the frequency with which they generate ideas in their everyday experiences (Runco et al., 2000).\n\nA number of studies have examined the influences on an individual’s creativity such as environment, emotions, cognition, stress, goals and motivation (Peterson et al., 2008; Edl et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015; Du et al., 2020). Peterson et al. (2008) found that the character strength of creativity correlated significantly with PTG (Peterson et al., 2008). It is a pity that creativity was only one of many character strengths included as outcomes in their study, the precise nature of the association between PTG and creativity was not investigated further or explained.\n\nCreative processes involve cognition and self-control (Edl et al., 2014). Traumatic events may impair cognitive processes and cognitive functioning, thus negatively affecting creativity (Paulus et al., 2010). Conversely, an examination of the experiences of 722 Chinese writers in the twentieth century found that those who suffered personal tragedy or political persecution were more likely to win creative awards in their later years (Niu and Kaufman, 2005). Thus, the effects of trauma can be both negative and positive.\n\nPTG can be accompanied by positive psychological changes, i.e., in personal attitudes, awareness, and health behaviors associated with growth (Siegel and Schrimshaw, 2000; Barskova and Oesterreich, 2009). It has been shown that increased creativity may constitute a manifestation of PTG (Forgeard, 2013). During the COVID-19 outbreak, Chinese university students have shown the ability to respond effectively to challenges and experience PTG (Chi et al., 2020). However, the positive changes in the behavior and the cognition of college students experiencing PTG need to be further explored through empirical studies (Liang et al., 2020). In summary, we believe that PTG can have a positive effect on the creativity of college students and propose the following hypothesis:\n\nH1: PTG has a positive correlation with creativity.\nThe Mediating Role of Self-Efficacy\nSelf-efficacy is a central concept in social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1978), which refers to an individual’s perceptions or beliefs about whether they are able to adopt appropriate behavior when faced with challenging circumstances. As a perception of “can do,” self-efficacy reflects a sense of control over the environment and may be thought of as the ability of individuals to handle certain life stressors with greater confidence (Schwarzer et al., 1997). According to the theory of self-efficacy, the sense of the individual of control over the environment and subjective evaluation of their own ability will affect their psychological status and behavioral choices. These include what behavioral choices to make, how much effort to put in and how long to persist in the face of difficulties, and the emotional state of the person facing the situation (Bandura, 1990). Self-efficacy is not static (Ng and Lucianetti, 2015), and it is influenced by a variety of internal and external factors such as achievement goals (Du et al., 2020), creativity training (Mathisen and Brønnick, 2009), and social support (Mathisen, 2011).\n\nPrevious research has shown that PTG is positively correlated with self-efficacy in both patient and survivor groups that have experienced a traumatic event (Barskova and Oesterreich, 2009). Self-efficacy manages people’s perceptions of the environment and their assessment of personal competence in the face of traumatic and stressful events (Bandura, 2011). People with high self-efficacy are more open to challenges thus are more likely to experience growth-related changes. PTG, both as a process and as an outcome, also can impact positively on an individual’s personality (Blackie and Jayawickreme, 2014). Therefore, we speculate that individuals who experience traumatic events and achieve growth can improve their general self-efficacy. Thus, it is proposed that individuals who experience PTG are more confident in themselves and, in their lives, then experience greater general self-efficacy in the face of stressful events (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004; Jia et al., 2017). It leads to the second hypothesis of the study:\n\nH2a: PTG has a positive correlation with self-efficacy.\nA number of studies have investigated the relationship between self-efficacy and creativity. In the field of creativity research, the positive correlation between an individual’s self-efficacy and an individual’s creativity is well recognized (Jaiswal and Dhar, 2016; Newman et al., 2018). In addition, some studies have explored the mediating role of self-efficacy in the relationship between creativity and other factors such as achievement goals (Du et al., 2020), motivation-enhancing practices (Ma et al., 2017), and active procrastination (Liu et al., 2017). The predictive effect of self-efficacy on creativity is also influenced by internal and external factors. For example, self-efficacy had a differential effect due to individual differences in creativity, and that it was negatively correlated with individual creativity for employees who were more promotion-oriented (Li C.-R. et al., 2020). In addition, researchers have empirically shown that college students’ award experience influences the degree of effect of their self-efficacy on creativity (Chang et al., 2016). Given so much overlap between self-efficacy and creativity, we propose the third hypothesis:\n\nH2b: Self-efficacy has a positive correlation with creativity.\nFrom a health behavior perspective, self-efficacy affects people’s health behaviors (Strecher et al., 1986). For example, the person who has high sense of self-efficacy is more likely to increase motivation to act, leading to greater achievement and better health (Zalewska-Puchala et al., 2007). This means that individuals who have increased self-efficacy during a traumatic event are likely to experience more positive changes. Thus, they are able to confidently cope with illness risks and implement positive and healthy behaviors, thereby promoting creative behaviors. In addition, self-efficacy mediates knowledge and behavior and facilitates the knowledge-behavior relations (Rimal, 2000). It has also been shown that self-efficacy mediates perceived efficacy of the government health measures and compliance during the pandemic, and that people with high self-efficacy are better able to have higher scores in behavioral compliance (Roma et al., 2020). It follows that self-efficacy as a factor that enables individuals to face life stresses with confidence is often presented as a mediating role in research.\n\nIndividuals who have experienced PTG may develop confidence in their own abilities and in their capacity to face the future, which may facilitate their achievement of more challenging and creative tasks. The COVID-19 has forced college student to study at home for long periods of time, resulting in students facing multiple stressors and suffering from general anxiety about their physical health, academics, and socialization (Cao et al., 2020; Li X. et al., 2020). Thus, COVID-19 has been a substantial stressor that can lead to psychological distress among college students (Lahav, 2020). Exposure to stressors leads to the secretion of cortisol in the body (Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004). It has been shown that physiological activity in humans is influenced by self-efficacy and that cortisol secretion is lower at when self-efficacy is high (Wiedenfeld et al., 1990, Nierop et al., 2008), thereby reducing the increase in cortisol that may result from traumatic events and mitigating the potentially damaging effects on neuronal and cognitive mechanisms (Schönfeld et al., 2013). This physiological mechanism reveals that an individual’s self-efficacy may have an effect on creative cognition by influencing the secretion of cortisol. Thus, the increase in self-efficacy, as an important aspect of PTG, protects psychological health, which facilitates the generation of creative ideas. On the other hand, changes in self-efficacy, an important judgment factor in the choice of challenging tasks and problem-solving, may have an impact on creativity. Then, we propose the fourth hypothesis.\n\nH2: Self-efficacy mediates PTG and creativity.\nThe Moderating Role of Deliberate Rumination\nThere are two main types of definitions of rumination in current research. Nolen-Hoeksema et al. (2008) defined rumination as an individual’s repeated, passive attention to the details of a stressful event, the possible causes and consequences of its symptoms, and the details of the course of the event. However, to assess contemplation objectively and neutrally, it is important to distinguish two main types of rumination: intrusive and deliberate (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004; Cann et al., 2011). Intrusive rumination refers to the individual’s passive repetition of the traumatic event in a negative manner, which is a non-constructive cognitive approach, whereas deliberate rumination refers to the individual’s active re-examination of the traumatic events and related information: they face the dilemma openly and solve the problem (Cann et al., 2011). Deliberate rumination represents the positive aspect of contemplation, whereby individuals actively reflect on and re-evaluate cognitive processes and ways of thinking to choose a more compatible worldview and lifestyle, shifting their personal attention to positive aspects (Joseph and Linley, 2005). Deliberate rumination allows individuals to achieve positive meaning construction of the stressful event (Cann et al., 2010b), which may lead to PTG of the individual (Wu et al., 2015). What’s more, deliberate rumination can lead to a more purposeful cognitive process and metacognition of the stressful event, which aims to solve problems and foreshadows the possibility of PTG (Cann et al., 2011), reducing the damage of the stressful event (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004). For example, in a study of PTG following cancer, it was found that enhanced deliberate rumination can facilitate individuals to achieve PTG (Rider Mundey et al., 2018). Studies have found a significant positive correlation between deliberate rumination and PTG (Andrades et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019). From above, we can infer that, to some extent, deliberate rumination seems to be an important factor in the individual’s perception of a potentially negative stressor. In summary, we propose a fifth hypothesis:\n\nH3a: Deliberate rumination has a positive correlation with PTG.\nStudies examining the effects of rumination on creativity have shown that different types of rumination affect creativity differently. An increase in creative thinking may stem from the development of a post-traumatic cognitive process (Liang et al., 2020), which involves cognitive and attentional control. Iterative rumination on individuals and events is also an important factor in the development of creativity (Verhaeghen et al., 2005). For example, it has been suggested that rumination contributes to the development of higher-value creative ideas (Forgeard et al., 2020). Self-reflective rumination stimulates interest in creative behavior (Verhaeghen et al., 2005, 2014). In light of the above, we believe it is worthwhile to further explore how deliberate rumination can contribute to the development of creativity in college students. Therefore, we hypothesize that.\n\nH3b: Deliberate rumination has a positive correlation with creativity.\nThe relationship between self-efficacy and rumination has been explored from different perspectives. Researchers have shown that rumination has a negative impact. For example, an empirical study with undergraduate nursing students showed that rumination can lead to depression and reduce self-efficacy, and that self-efficacy does not alleviate depression (Takagishi et al., 2013).\n\nConversely, higher levels of self-efficacy contribute to an individual’s ability to adapt and develop. Individuals with PTSD and possessing higher self-efficacy chose to extract memories that promoted an increase in self-efficacy when recalling experiences (Brown et al., 2016). In other words, self-efficacy had a positive impact on deliberate rumination. It is generally accepted that rumination is likely to trigger negative emotions and thoughts in individuals, but the facilitative role of rumination with positive beliefs in problem-solving has been overlooked (Dunn and Sensky, 2018). Furthermore, finding support for one’s view of oneself by reviewing the past and constructing future events is often beneficial in establishing and maintaining self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997). Therefore, we suggest that there is an association between self-efficacy, deliberate rumination and creativity, and that, due to its plasticity (Ng and Lucianetti, 2015), self-efficacy has different effects on creativity at different levels of deliberate rumination. In summary, we hypothesize that.\n\nH3c: Deliberate rumination has a positive correlation with self-efficacy.\nBased on existing research and the hypotheses above, we further propose that\n\nH3: Deliberate rumination moderates the second half of the path of “PTG → self-efficacy → creativity.”\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Procedures\nThe study was conducted at a polytechnic in Guangdong Province, China, that serves more than 20,000 full-time students. A total of 918 students completed the survey questionnaire. After data collection, 37 participants who were not from Guangdong were excluded from the study, and so the actual number of valid questionnaires was 881. Among the interviewees, 317 (35.982%) were male and 564 (64.018%) were female. Before the research design was finalized, the researchers conducted exploratory focus-group interviews with students at the school to understand their emotional profile and psychological state. The majority of the interviewees indicated that they had been depressed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe present study followed a correlational design and used a web-based questionnaire as the data collection method. The questionnaires were completed between April 10 and June 15, 2020. A QR code for completing the questionnaire was sent to students electronically during the time college students were studying online because their in-person classes were canceled because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants simply had to scan the QR code, go to the on-screen questionnaire, answer the questions and then click on Submit (QR refers to quick response, a readable barcode that contains a large amount of information. Devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, use cameras to scan the QR code and recognize the binary data in it, which takes them to a specific linked website). In China, QR codes are widely used as a means of accessing specific webpages and for other tasks, such as making financial payments, providing identification and searching for information. It should be emphasized that the purpose of the study was explained in detail before the QR code was scanned and that all participants completed the questionnaire on a voluntary basis.\n\nMaterials\nThe questionnaire used in this study consisted of 64 items divided into five sections: (a) demographic information, (b) Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, (c) Runco Ideational Behavior Scale, (d) General Self-Efficacy Scale, and (e) Deliberate Rumination Inventory. The demographic information included gender, home address, and profession. Runco Ideational Behavior Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Deliberate Rumination Inventory above-mentioned scales were originally developed in English and translated into Chinese for this study. In order to improve the quality of the translations, a back-translation method was used (Brislin, 1970); that is, the first researcher translated the English version into Chinese, then a second researcher back-translated the translated English into Chinese, and a third researcher compared the original, translated, and back-translated versions of the scales to assess the accuracy of the translations. The translations were corrected and optimized prior to finalizing the questionnaire to ensure the equivalence of the scales.\n\nPosttraumatic Growth Inventory\nThe study used the Chinese version of the Posttraumatic Growth Scale, originally proposed by Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) and later translated by Geng et al. (2011). The scale consists of 21 items that cover five dimensions: interpersonal relationships (e.g., “Putting effort into my relationships”), new possibilities (e.g., “I’m more likely to try to change things which need changing”), personal strengths (e.g., “I discovered that I’m stronger than I thought I was”), spiritual changes (e.g., “A better understanding of spiritual matters”), and the appreciation of life (e.g., “Appreciating each day”). The scale has six points that measure feelings, reactions, and agreement (1 = no change to 6 = very high degree of change). In the present study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.958.\n\nRunco Ideational Behavior Scale\nThe Runco Ideational Behavior Scale, developed by Runco et al. (2000), was used in this study. It consists of 23 self-report items (e.g., “I think about ideas more often than most people” and “I am able to think up answers to problems that have not already been figured out”) that measure the level of creative behavior in everyday life on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). In the present study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.938.\n\nGeneral Self-Efficacy Scale\nThe General Self-Efficacy Scale (Schwarzer et al., 1997), which consists of 10 items, was used in this study. After discussion, the last three items of the original scale were removed so as to take into account the specific situation of participants and research needs, reducing the total to seven (e.g., “I can always manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough” and “I am confident that I could deal efficiently with unexpected events”). The scale has four points (1 = not at all true to 4 = very true). In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.875.\n\nDeliberate Rumination Inventory\nThe Deliberate Rumination Inventory, part of the Event-Related Rumination Inventory, developed by Cann et al. (2011), was used in this study. The inventory, consisting of 10 items (e.g., “I thought about whether I could find meaning from my experience” and “I thought about the event and tried to understand what happened”), assesses the frequency of deliberate rumination in injured people. The scale rated on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = not at all and 4 = always). In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the inventory was 0.913.\n\nData Analysis\nVersion 23.0 of SPSS was used to perform the analysis. Since self-report data were collected for this study, common method biases were tested to ensure its validity by using the Harman single factor test before data processing (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The 74 items in the questionnaire related to the four variables were tested. The results showed that nine factors had eigenvalues greater than 1. These factors contributed 63.876% of the total variance. The first factor explained only 31.878% of the variance, which did not reach the critical criterion of 40% (Zhou and Long, 2004), indicating that there is no significant common methodological bias in this study.\n\nAfter common-method-bias evaluation, we carried out descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, and model testing of the data based on the research hypotheses. First, we examined trends in concentration and dispersion of the data. Then, we tested the relationships between the independent, mediating, dependent, and moderating variables by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficients. A model was constructed based on the results of the correlation analysis, and the hypotheses proposed were tested, and the PROCESS (version 3.3) plug-in in SPSS was used to test the mediating effect of self-efficacy and the moderating effect of deliberate rumination. [The PROCESS plug-in was developed by Hayes (2013) specifically for path analysis-based regulation and mediator analysis and their combinations].\n\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics and Correlations Analyses\nMeans, standard deviations, and correlations of the study variables were calculated. As shown in Table 1, the PTG of participating college students was significantly and positively correlated with general self-efficacy (r = 0.466, p < 0.01) and creativity (r = 0.434, p < 0.01). Their general self-efficacy was positively correlated with creativity (r = 0.475, p < 0.01) and deliberate rumination (r = 0.216, p < 0.01). In addition, deliberate rumination was positively correlated with creativity (r = 0.288, p < 0.01). Thus, the results of the correlation analysis provided preliminary support for the subsequent mediated-effects test. In addition, gender was used as a control variable in the current study. And, it was dummy coded (1, female and 0, male).\n\nTable 1\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics and correlations among variables.\n\nMediation Analysis of Self-Efficacy\nMultiple regression analysis was performed using Model 4 of the PROCESS component of SPSS, with PTG as the independent variable, creativity as the dependent variable and general self-efficacy as the mediating variable. As shown in Table 2, PTG positively predicted creativity (β = 0.150, SE = 0.018, p < 0.001). As well, PTG was positively correlated to self-efficacy (β = 0.248, SE = 0.016, p < 0.001), and self-efficacy was positively correlated to creativity (β = 0.375, SE = 0.035, p < 0.001).\n\nTable 2\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 2. Testing the mediating effect of PTG on creativity.\n\nIn addition, we used the bootstrap method to test the confidence interval (CI) estimates, which showed that the 95% confidence intervals for the direct and indirect effects of PTG on creativity did not include 0. Thus, the partial mediator equation model of general self-efficacy held, and self-efficacy was the mediating variable in the relationship between PTG and creativity. The direct effect (0.150) and the mediating effect (0.093) accounted for 61.728 and 38.272% of the total effect, respectively (see Table 3).\n\nTable 3\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 3. Total effect, direct effect and indirect effect among the variables.\n\nModerated Mediation Effects\nTo test H3, the second half of the mediated model was analyzed by adding the moderating variable deliberate rumination. Then we used SPSS PROCESS Model 14 to test the model. The results showed that deliberate rumination was positively correlated to creativity (β = 0.178, p < 0.001) with a 95% CI [0.111, 0.244]. The interaction term of self-efficacy and deliberate rumination reached a significant level for creativity (β = −0.186, p < 0.001) with a 95% confidence interval of [−0.282, −0.090] (see Table 4). The model is shown in Figure 1.\n\nTable 4\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 4. Testing the moderated mediating effect of PTG on creativity.\n\nFigure 1\n www.frontiersin.org\nFigure 1. The moderated mediation model.\n\nIn order to further analyze the moderating effect of deliberate rumination, the study divided deliberate rumination into low (M − 1SD) and high (M + 1SD) groups and performed a simple slope analysis. The results showed that 95% of the CIs did not include zero and that deliberate rumination influenced the strength of the relationship between self-efficacy and creativity (see Table 5). Self-efficacy was a stronger predictor of creativity with low (i.e., M − 1 SD) levels of deliberate rumination (see Figure 2).\n\nTable 5\n www.frontiersin.org\nTable 5. Conditional indirect effect at specific levels of deliberate rumination when mediated by general self-efficacy.\n\nFigure 2\n www.frontiersin.org\nFigure 2. The relationship between self-efficacy and creativity for high and low levels of deliberate rumination.\n\nDiscussion\nDiscussion of the Results\nFirst, the present study shows that PTG significantly predicts creativity in college students, which was relatively consistent with H1 and previous studies on the positive effects of traumatic events, which have the potential to increase creativity (Forgeard, 2013; Liang et al., 2020). According to the PTG model proposed by Tedeschi and Calhoun (2004), traumatic events change an individual’s worldview, and PTG is the result of reconstruction and integration of cognitive assessments of traumatic events. The cognitive assessment process may involve cognitive neurological and psychological rehabilitation, prompting reflection and return to a way of life more in line with their values, thus changing their behavior and thinking (Baseotto et al., 2020). At the same time, from a mental and behavioral developmental perspective, negative experiences can have an impact on an individual’s cognitive and behavioral structure (Yi et al., 2017). When faced with difficulties and distress, they think deeply and explore ways to find a way out of the situation. In the process, they choose new ways of thinking and make an effort to adopt behaviors that build new cognitive structures and behavioral systems (Helson and Roberts, 1994). By using a variety of strategies to solve problems and readjust to a new life, they successfully embrace new ways of making sense of the world and develop new cognitive structures that promote cognitive flexibility and innovative behavior (Cann et al., 2010a). As a result, individuals who have experienced PTG have a more objective and positive perception of the traumatic event and on the challenges of everyday life. This positive emotional state is conducive to creative development (Han et al., 2019). So, measuring levels of PTG can predict an individual’s perception of their increased level of creativity.\n\nSecond, the findings validate H2a, H2b, and H2. The results show that PTG positively predicts an individual’s self-efficacy, which aligns with previous findings that individuals who have experienced PTG may be able to develop greater confidence in themselves (Joseph et al., 1993; Arpawong et al., 2013; Glad et al., 2013). This finding supports the PTG model, which posits positive changes in self-perception (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004). In other words, the positive impact of a traumatic event may also be reflected in the individual’s reassessment of their ability to face and resolve past or possible future traumatic events in a more confidently and courageously. In addition, individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to experience PTG (Benight and Bandura, 2004; Prati and Pietrantoni, 2009; Jurišová, 2016). Thus, PTG and self-efficacy are closely related.\n\nThe results also validate the positive predictive effect of self-efficacy on creativity, which also aligns with the results of previous studies. According to social cognitive theory, people with high self-efficacy tend to be more open to challenges, put a higher level of effort into an activity and pay more sustained attention to it (Bandura, 1978, 1982). Therefore, with regard to creativity, self-efficacy affects the individual’s abilities to engage in the creative process: persons with low self-efficacy may cease their efforts when faced with challenges and dilemmas, and so fail to produce a product of creative value. In addition, the component model of creativity points by Amabile (1988) to internal motivation as one of the most important factors influencing creativity. Individuals with high self-efficacy, which is a source of motivation, tend to set creative goals and are confident of reaching them (Intasao and Hao, 2018). However, those with doubts about their own abilities tend to avoid situations and tasks that are beyond their creative reach, which can make it difficult for them to develop and demonstrate practical skills and abilities (Locke and Latham, 2006). During the COVID-19 pandemic, college students who experienced PTG may have increase their level of self-efficacy, which had a protective effect on cognitive (Wang et al., 2014). As a result, they have been able to gather materials and ideas from life in a more positive frame of mind and stimulate their creative behavior. In summary, it is logical that self-efficacy plays a mediating role between PTG and creativity.\n\nThird, the results are also consistent with H3a, H3b, H3c, and the results of other studies. To begin, deliberate rumination by college students had a positive impact on PTG, which validates previous research that showed that deliberate rumination has a constructive effect on human development. Therefore, in mental health counseling and interventions for college students, it is important to help them to transform cathartic negative thoughts and emotions into positive perceptions of the traumatic event in order to facilitate the occurrence of PTG. Further, deliberate rumination had a positive effect on college students’ creativity (Verhaeghen et al., 2005, 2014; Forgeard et al., 2020). In past studies, self-efficacy and rumination were considered as important factors influencing individual physical and mental growth, with the former often representing a positive influence and the latter being associated with mental illness (Takagishi et al., 2013; Karabati et al., 2017; Nota and Coles, 2018), However, the two dimensions of rumination have not been comprehensively discussed. Deliberate rumination, which involves active self-reflection and reflection, can help individuals to better cope with difficult situations (Dunn and Sensky, 2018). Finally, deliberate rumination had a positive correlation with students’ self-efficacy, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies (Bandura, 1997; Brown et al., 2016). The frequency of rumination among college students influenced their level of creativity and deliberate rumination, which means individual have positive beliefs stimulates creative interests and behaviors.\n\nFourth, the present study found that deliberate rumination plays a moderating role in the influence of college students’ self-efficacy on creativity, which confirms H3. The present study found that the positive effect of self-efficacy on creativity was more significant for college students with lower levels of deliberate rumination compared to those with high levels of deliberate rumination. According to Cann et al. (2011), deliberate rumination enables people to positively understand negative events in order to solve problems. As mentioned above, deliberate rumination has been found to be an important predictor of PTG. For example, it has been shown that deliberate rumination motivates individuals to rethink the world, others, and self and to take the initiative to obtain social support to reduce stress and grow (Xu et al., 2019). Therefore, college students with higher levels of deliberate rumination have the ability and means to solve problems and rate their level of creativity higher. In contrast, students with low levels of deliberate rumination inhibit the development of creativity due to a lack of proactive and constructive thinking about events and problems (Cohen and Ferrari, 2010; Vahle-Hinz et al., 2017).\n\nHowever, it does not mean that higher levels of deliberate rumination are better, because students with low levels of deliberate rumination were more likely to be influenced by self-efficacy as a factor. As the frequency of deliberate rumination decreased, the effect of self-efficacy on creativity increased. While deliberate rumination assists individuals in finding meaning in stressful events, this meaning may involve negative beliefs, worldviews, and self-concepts (Kamijo and Yukawa, 2018), which may lead to negative emotions, which reveals that when suffer a stressful event, individuals who possess strong deliberate rumination may reinforce the recurrence of negative emotions to the extent that they reduce their self-efficacy in dealing with the stressful event, thus weakening the development of creativity. The high levels of deliberate rumination are more likely lead to negative emotions due to the fact that during the COVID-19 outbreak, students studied at home for long periods of time and were unable to communicate with others and so resolve their confusion. Then changes in self-efficacy have less impact on the effect of creativity under the effect of negative emotions such as anxiety and helplessness (Hu et al., 2015). Dispersed thinking is a core component of creative thinking (Runco and Acar, 2012). When deliberate rumination levels are lower, individuals with high levels of self-efficacy are able to positively think and solve problems from multiple perspectives due to reduced frequency of repetitive thinking about events and constant self-focusing. Then the influence of self-efficacy on creativity is subsequently enhanced.\n\nImplications\nIn a theoretical sense, our study links PTG and creativity, a new learning that deepens understanding of the positive impact of traumatic events on the mechanisms of creativity. In addition, the researchers analyzed mediating and moderating effects. Using self-efficacy as a mediating variable, they found that the PTG of college students increased their self-efficacy and ultimately had a positive effect on their creativity, while deliberate rumination had a moderating effect on self-efficacy and creativity.\n\nIn a practical sense, this study has described the relationship between the four variables presented in this study, which may help researchers to better understand the mechanisms by which creativity develops after trauma. Therefore, the negative impact of major public health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can be alleviated through positive psychological interventions with the college student population. This theory has a great guiding role in reality. After college students experience traumatic events, effective measures can be taken to promote their PTG, improving their self-efficacy and avoiding them having too high frequency of deliberate rumination so as to develop their creativity. During the outbreak confinement, The Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China asked universities to set up psychological support hotlines and online counseling services to mitigate the psychological damage caused to students. For instance, several universities provided psychological counseling services for students, offering them access to psychological problems, timely follow-up by professionals, and regular visits thus providing better attention to students’ PTG (The Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, 2020). Second, news media should also focus on promoting healthy lifestyles and new forms of activities that emerge during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as online supermarkets, video consultations, and live home activities, which will help the public to build confidence in their lives and avoid excessive attention of epidemic-related information. Meanwhile, the mutual assistance of epidemic prevention resources and the timely response of staff to residents’ needs in the community will enhance individuals’ sense of security and alleviate the negative feelings associated with isolation and excessive rumination. Such interventions can help the students to reconstruct their perception of adversity and enable them to develop positive self-beliefs and so promote the creative process.\n\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThis study has certain limitations. First, the cross-sectional study used in this study, while revealing correlations between the variables, does not allow for inference of causality between the variables tested. Future researchers could conduct longitudinal studies to determine whether the scores measured effectively represent an actual increase in creativity. Second, this study was conducted with college students from the same college, and due to the limitations of sampling at that time, gender balance of the samples was not achieved. In the future, the external validity of the results of this study can be tested by selecting subjects from a wider range of sources and more balanced gender. Third, this study only focused on the moderating effect of deliberate rumination between self-efficacy and creativity. Future research could further expand on the effects of other dimensions of rumination on creativity after a traumatic event. Finally, the effects of other factors, such as major discipline and gender on the four variables, have not been explored in this study, and future research could include control variables to further clarify the relationship between the four variables.\n\nConclusion\nThis study tested a moderated mediation model to examine the relationship between PTG and creativity, and the mediating role of self-efficacy between the two and the moderating role of deliberate rumination in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that PTG positively predicted creativity while self-efficacy mediated the relationship between the two. Furthermore, deliberate rumination moderated self-efficacy in the second half of the mediating pathway between PTG and creativity. More specifically, the positive predictive effect of self-efficacy on creativity was more pronounced at low levels of deliberate rumination.\"\"\"",

      "content": "**Developing Self-Efficacy in Educational Experiences Through the Lens of Polyvagal Theory**\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSelf-efficacy—the belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish tasks—is a critical factor influencing motivation, learning, and psychological well-being. It plays a central role in Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG), resilience, and creativity. Understanding self-efficacy through the lens of Polyvagal Theory can offer valuable insights into how we can effectively cultivate it in educational settings.\n\n---\n\n**Understanding Self-Efficacy**\n\n**Definition and Importance**\n\n- **Self-Efficacy** is a foundational concept in Albert Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory. It affects how people think, feel, motivate themselves, and behave.\n- High self-efficacy leads to greater confidence, persistence in the face of challenges, and resilience after failures.\n- In the context of PTG, self-efficacy mediates the transformation of traumatic experiences into opportunities for growth and creativity.\n\n---\n\n**Polyvagal Theory and Its Connection to Self-Efficacy**\n\n**Overview of Polyvagal Theory**\n\n- **Polyvagal Theory**, developed by Dr. Stephen Porges, explains how the autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates our physiological state and, consequently, our emotional experiences and behaviors.\n- The theory highlights three neural circuits:\n  1. **Ventral Vagal System** (Social Engagement System): Associated with feelings of safety and social connection.\n  2. **Sympathetic Nervous System**: Mobilizes the body for fight-or-flight responses.\n  3. **Dorsal Vagal System**: Engages immobilization or shutdown responses in extreme stress.\n\n**Connection to Self-Efficacy**\n\n- **Physiological State Influences Psychological Perception**: According to Polyvagal Theory, our physiological state can enhance or inhibit our ability to engage, learn, and respond effectively.\n- **Safety and Social Engagement Enhance Self-Efficacy**: When individuals feel safe (ventral vagal activation), they are more open to new experiences, can regulate emotions better, and have higher self-efficacy.\n- **Stress Impairs Self-Efficacy**: Chronic activation of the sympathetic or dorsal vagal systems can lead to feelings of anxiety or helplessness, undermining self-efficacy.\n\n---\n\n**Strategies to Develop Self-Efficacy in Educational Experiences**\n\n**1. Creating a Safe and Supportive Learning Environment**\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\n- **Safety First**: A sense of safety activates the ventral vagal system, enabling optimal engagement and learning.\n- **Trust and Connection**: Positive relationships with educators and peers bolster confidence and willingness to take risks.\n\n**Implementation**\n\n- **Establish Psychological Safety**: Encourage open communication, respect, and acceptance.\n- **Build Strong Relationships**: Facilitate activities that promote bonding and trust among participants.\n- **Positive Reinforcement**: Provide consistent encouragement and acknowledge efforts and achievements.\n\n**2. Incorporating Somatic Practices**\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\n- **Mind-Body Connection**: Somatic practices help regulate the ANS, promoting a state conducive to learning and self-efficacy.\n- **Emotion Regulation**: Techniques like deep breathing and mindfulness reduce stress responses.\n\n**Implementation**\n\n- **Mindfulness Exercises**: Begin sessions with brief mindfulness or breathing exercises.\n- **Movement Activities**: Incorporate yoga, stretching, or other gentle movements to enhance body awareness.\n- **Grounding Techniques**: Teach participants methods to center themselves during moments of stress.\n\n**3. Enhancing Mastery Experiences**\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\n- **Building Competence**: Success in challenging tasks strengthens self-efficacy.\n- **Incremental Challenges**: Gradually increasing difficulty helps participants experience growth without overwhelming them.\n\n**Implementation**\n\n- **Set Achievable Goals**: Collaboratively set personalized, attainable objectives.\n- **Skill-Building Activities**: Provide opportunities to develop and practice new skills.\n- **Reflective Practices**: Encourage participants to reflect on their progress and recognize their improvements.\n\n**4. Utilizing Modeling and Social Learning**\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\n- **Vicarious Experiences**: Observing others succeed can enhance one's belief in their own abilities.\n- **Social Engagement**: Interacting with peers activates the ventral vagal system.\n\n**Implementation**\n\n- **Peer Learning**: Organize group projects or peer mentoring systems.\n- **Success Stories**: Share narratives of individuals who overcame challenges.\n- **Role Models**: Invite speakers or facilitators who exemplify high self-efficacy.\n\n**5. Providing Constructive Feedback**\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\n- **Positive Reinforcement**: Acknowledges efforts and provides guidance for improvement.\n- **Growth Mindset**: Encourages viewing challenges as opportunities for development.\n\n**Implementation**\n\n- **Specific Feedback**: Offer clear, actionable insights rather than general praise or criticism.\n- **Encourage Self-Assessment**: Guide participants to evaluate their own work and identify strengths and areas for growth.\n- **Celebrate Effort and Strategy**: Focus on the processes and strategies used, not just outcomes.\n\n**6. Managing Rumination Through Emotional Regulation Techniques**\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\n- **Balancing Reflection**: Helps participants process experiences without becoming stuck in negative thought patterns.\n- **Reducing Overwhelm**: Prevents excessive rumination from undermining self-efficacy.\n\n**Implementation**\n\n- **Cognitive Reframing**: Teach participants to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts.\n- **Time-Limited Reflection**: Set aside specific times for reflection to prevent overthinking.\n- **Emotional Literacy**: Help participants recognize and name their emotions, promoting better regulation.\n\n---\n\n**Integrating These Strategies into Educational Programs**\n\n**Aligning with Existing Frameworks**\n\n- **Bloom's Accelerator Programs**: Incorporate self-efficacy development into stages like onboarding, curriculum design, and weekly training.\n- **Strengths-Oriented Approach**: Use assessments to identify individual strengths and tailor activities that build on them.\n- **Community Building**: Leverage the principle that \"we grow best when we grow together\" to foster a supportive learning community.\n\n**Streamlining Implementation**\n\n- **Holistic Activities**: Design exercises that simultaneously address multiple aspects (e.g., a group project that builds skills, fosters relationships, and provides mastery experiences).\n- **Integrate into Routine**: Make self-efficacy-building practices a regular part of sessions rather than standalone events.\n- **Leverage Technology**: Use online platforms to provide resources, track progress, and facilitate community interactions.\n\n---\n\n**Example of a Streamlined Educational Experience**\n\n**Weekly Workshop Structure**\n\n1. **Opening Mindfulness Exercise (5 minutes)**\n   - Activates the ventral vagal system, promoting a calm and receptive state.\n\n2. **Goal Setting and Reflection (10 minutes)**\n   - Participants set or review personal goals, fostering a sense of agency.\n\n3. **Skill-Building Activity (30 minutes)**\n   - Engage in tasks that are challenging yet achievable, promoting mastery.\n\n4. **Group Collaboration (30 minutes)**\n   - Work on collaborative projects, enhancing social engagement and learning.\n\n5. **Modeling and Success Stories (15 minutes)**\n   - Share experiences or bring in guest speakers to inspire and model self-efficacy.\n\n6. **Closing Feedback and Gratitude Practice (10 minutes)**\n   - Provide constructive feedback and end with expressing gratitude, reinforcing positive emotions.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nViewing self-efficacy through the lens of Polyvagal Theory underscores the importance of physiological safety and social connection in fostering confidence and growth. By creating educational experiences that address both the psychological and physiological needs of participants, we can effectively enhance self-efficacy. Streamlining these practices into regular programming ensures that self-efficacy development is an integral and seamless part of the learning journey.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Holistic Approach**: Combine psychological strategies with somatic practices to address mind and body.\n- **Safe Environment**: Prioritize creating a sense of safety and connection to optimize learning.\n- **Empowerment**: Focus on building self-efficacy through mastery experiences and positive reinforcement.\n- **Manage Rumination**: Teach participants to balance reflection with action to prevent excessive rumination.\n- **Community Support**: Leverage social engagement to enhance self-efficacy and overall well-being.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, educational programs can cultivate resilient, confident, and creative individuals capable of transforming adversity into growth and innovation.\n\n---\n\n**References**\n\n- Bandura, A.

INTRODUCTION\n\nChildren who were abused during childhood often have to live a traumatic experience because most of the time, the abuser is from their own family. The data obtained from the Ministry of Empowerment of Women and Children Protection of the Republic of Indonesia in 2019 showed that 33% of the children abused were within 0-12 years old. The abuse was in the form of physical (28%), psychological (23%), and abandonment (7%) abuse. A traumatic incident experienced by children is called Adverse Childhood Experience [1, 2]. This ACEs traumatic experience may severely affect mental health and have a negative impact on social and psychological life, in addition to physical health, that makes people antisocial. Individuals who experienced the trauma would experience a lot of changes in their lives. However, not all traumatic experiences affect someone’s life badly because some people who experienced trauma might develop a better life than before. Positive changes may occur to somebody after experiencing a traumatic childhood.\n\nAn individual’s positive change after a post-traumatic event is termed Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG). PTG is a positive impact for someone who decides to struggle positively with their trauma. Examples of positive PTG include seeking a meaningful life, making positive changes like getting up from rock bottom experiences, and making psychological improvements about their condition [3]. PTG is a psychological change that happens cognitively and emotionally to individuals as a result of their traumatic events in the past, which may be related to themselves, other parties, and the future [4, 5]. An individual’s positive change results from a process of facing lots of changes, struggles, and other challenges, which upgrades someone’s higher cognitive functional adaptation [6]. Calhoun and Tedeschi [7] divide PTG into five domains: a. Personal Strength is when someone would report positive changes and describe himself as a better person. Being stronger, more creative, more confident, and are open to the different changes that may happen to be a better individual; b. Relating to others is when someone would show development when having a better relationship with their family, friends, or people who experience the same traumatic event; c. Encompasses Appreciation for life is when someone reports having a clear vision about what is important in life and could rearrange his priorities in life through many aspects, such as the increase of existential consciousness; d. New Possibilities is when someone shows a desire to change his life’s direction by learning some new knowledge and skills after enduring a traumatic experience; e. Spiritual Change is when someone shows how to actively participate and have faith in higher beings.\n\nSome research works show a negative correlation between pressure and PTG, which means if the individual develops a higher PTG experience, his/her perception toward past difficulties will likely drop and will be able to overcome cognitive problems. According to that research, it is important to investigate the factors that will help someone who experiences ACEs to develop PTG in the next development. To achieve PTG, it is affected by some general factors. One of those factors is a psychological factor [8]. Traumatic experiences imply some negative circumstances that may cause suffering, vulnerability, uncertainty, and lack of one’s life control. Putting them all together, someone may have a perception of what becomes the benefits of being a survivor from trauma [7, 9].\n\nThe PTG terminology, introduced firstly by Tedeschi and Calhoun [9], is related to the positive change that involves the perception of the self by others. It occurs in conjunction with the life appreciation that arises as a consequence of the attempt to handle the traumatic life experienced by the PTG so that a balanced life can be achieved from the coping mechanism. This phenomenon shows that the effects of the trauma undergo a transformation, thereby increasing compared to the initial stage of the trauma. Tedeschi and Calhoun [7] referred to this phenomenon to understand how the PTG was formed as a result of the cognitive involvement of a deeper understanding of what happened to the self and the world. The mechanism of PTG is associated with cognitive reconstruction and the events that determine someone’s future.\n\nOne’s endurance in facing an unpleasant event can affect how far someone reaches PTG. The quality possessed by someone when facing life difficulties can be seen from how more capable he would be in handling a difficult situation and being resilient [10]. This is supported by a study conducted by Mahdi et al. [11], who concluded that two dimensions of resilience, adaptive capacity, and positive acceptance, had a significant impact on PTG after undergoing a traumatic event. The meaning of psychological resilience by scholars, in general, is the existence of a positive adaptation in facing difficulties [10]. Resilience is then usually explored in various contexts, which have different levels from mild hassles (e.g., work stress) to severe trauma (e.g., mourning, life-threatening events). Many factors contribute to resilience, including personal factors, such as spirituality, optimism, positive emotions, cognitive flexibility, active coping, and acceptance, as well as biological and environmental factors (e.g., relationships with family and peers, a sense of social belonging), which can be considered as a source of resilience [12, 13].\n\nResilience is related to PTG since it is depicted as the recovering ability to return back to the time when the difficulties happened with only a minimal reaction after that event [14]. It is a fact that resilient individuals actually have above-average skills in communication, cognitive, and problem-solving abilities. In addition, it is also related to having a high self-confidence in the future, the ability to manage their attitudes, self-appreciation towards life, good relation to other people, inner strength, new possibilities, and spiritual development, so that PTG could grow as a result of the trauma or crisis experience [9].\n\nLiu et al. [15], in their studies, conveyed that a harmful childhood with ACE is known as having risks of several social, economic, and health issues in their lives. Meanwhile, resilience is known as the protective factor for children to make an upswing from their bad childhood experience. Research from O’Malley et al. [16] showed that ACE is related to the resilience undergone during adolescence and early adulthood. The resilience was formed from aspects, such as the ability to adapt, tolerance for negative effects and reinforcement from stress, perception of control, and persistence in its role as a mediator for ACE, which may increase the experience of post-traumatic growth that is manifested as a personal strength and an appreciation of life [9, 17]. As illustrated, resilience with the before-mentioned dimensions will increase PTG due to the benefit of obtaining a positive change after experiencing a difficult childhood ACE or other challenges [17].\n\n1.1. Research Objectives\n\nThis study aimed to figure out the role of resilience as a mediator in the relation between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Post Traumatic Growth (PTG). Two hypotheses were proposed in this research: the traumatic event experienced in childhood has a correlation with post-traumatic growth, and resilience has a positive impact on the post-traumatic growth the individual experienced which was the result of ACEs.\n\n2. METHODS\n\n2.1. Research Procedure\n\nA quantitative correlational method was used in this research to investigate the relation between the three examined variables: Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE), Resilience, and Post-traumatic Growth (PTG). The data were taken online using Google Forms filled by the participants who fit with the criteria for this research. Prior to the research, all participants were given a chance to give their consent in an Informed Consent form. The participants who agreed were then included in this research. The research discussed here had been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Psychology, Soegijapranata Catholic University (Approval Number: 005/B.7.5/FP.KEP/IV/2021).\n\n2.2. Research Participants\n\nThe population for this research was 12-year-old individuals who experienced unpleasant incidents or traumatic experiences in childhood and were living in Indonesia. In this research, the researchers used convenience sampling to gather the data obtained by filling an online form conducted using Google forms published via Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, and other Social Networking Sites (SNS). Data were collected for approximately three months, from December 2020 to February 2021. A total of 349 respondents provided the collective profile described, participants from adolescents up to elderly and mostly female (77.7%), and the majority graduated from high school (60.5%%).\n\n2.3. Research Instruments\n\nThree research instruments were used in this research:\n\nAdverse Childhood Experiences Inventory: The instrument was used to measure 10 kinds of childhood trauma. The items on the ACE checklist were divided into two parts: the first part comprised five items that contained direct trauma to the participants, such as violence in the form of physical abuse, verbal abuse, sexual harassment, physical abandonment, and emotional abandonment. The second part also consisted of five other items, which contained things that were related to other families. The ACE applied in the research was developed by Felitti et al. [18]. This research participant comprised alcoholic parents, an abused mother, imprisoned family members, family members with mental illness, and divorced parents.\n\nConnor Davidson Resilience Scale: Resilience as the mediator variable in this research was measured using the resilience scale, which was interpreted from Connor and Davidson’s Resilience Scale [10]. This scale, like Likert Scale, consisted of 5 scores starting from 0 ‘not right at all’, to 4 ‘almost always right.’ This scale comprised of 25 items, which was divided into 5 aspects to depict the resilience construct based on the previous research by Connor and Davidson, including 1) personal competency, high standard, and persistence; 2) belief in instinct, negative effect tolerance, and empowerment from the effect of stress; 3) positive acceptance towards changes and a friendly relation; 4) control; and 5) spiritual impact.\n\nPost Traumatic Growth Inventory: PTGI translated into Bahasa Indonesia was used to measure the level of Post-Traumatic Growth [19, 20]. The PTGI that was used to calculate the dependent variables in this research comprised of 21 items that had a scale of 6 scores in each item starting from 0 ‘I did not feel any changes after my crisis,’ to 5 ‘I felt big changes after my crisis.’ A series of aspects measured in this scale to examine the PTG experienced by the participants were: 1) personal strength; 2) life appreciation; 3) relationship with other people; 4) new possibilities; 5) and spiritual changes.\n\n2.4. Data Analysis Procedure\n\nThe acquired data in this research were processed using an IBM SPSS for Statistics 26 and IBM SPSS AMOS 23. Three main variables will be analysed in this research, ACEs as the independent variable, PTG as the dependent variable, and resilience, which is expected to play the mediating role in the relationship between independent and dependent variables. CD-RISC and PTGI measuring instruments that had been translated were used to measure constructed validity using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The scattered items and aspects of the data obtained were checked with previous findings. Besides, demographical data will also be included in this article, which is presented in the results section as well. A set of Pearson’s correlation tests (one-tailed) were conducted to explore associations between variables and their factors. To test the main hypotheses, the researchers used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) with the help of IBM SPSS AMOS 23. It was expected that resilience takes the mediating role in the relations between ACEs and PTG; whether the mediating effect was partial or complete mediation also be investigated statistically. In addition, path analysis was performed to investigate the mediating role of each resilience factor in this study framework. Throughout the report, we used the significance threshold (α) of .05.\n\n3. RESULTS\n\nIn this research, there were 349 participants who were within the age gap of 12 – 18 years old until 65 years old. As shown in Table 1, most were female (N=271; 77,7%). The educational background of the respondents was varied from elementary school to post-graduate. Most of them were high-school graduates, i.e., 60.5% (N = 211). Most of the participants were also single (N = 296; 84.8%). A total of 59 participants were married (14.9%), and the rest of the participants were divorced. The status and occupation of the participants were mostly students (from high school to university level). Data for this demography were noted as 60.5% (N=211).\n\nTable 1.\nParticipants’ demographic data.\n  Variable\t          Category\t          Percentage\n  Sex\t          Male\t          22.3\n          Female\t          77.7\n  Age\t          12-18\t          14.6\n          18 - 29\t          71.3\n          30 - 39\t          7.2\n          40 - 49\t          2.9\n          50 – 60\t          1.1\n          > 60\t          2.9\n  Education Background\t          Elementary\t          2.6\n          Junior High\t          7.7\n          Senior High\t          60.5\n          Undergraduate\t          23.5\n          Graduate\t          4.6\n          Postgraduate\t          1.1\n  Marital Status\t          Single\t          84.8\n          Married\t          14.9\n          Divorced\t          .3\nValidity measuring instruments were tested using CFA for their validity. In the research, the CFA (presented in Fig. 1) showed that the adaptation of the CD-RISD scale had a good Model Fit (GFI = .874, CFI = .917, RMSEA = .069) with standardized items’ loading factors ranging from 0.524 to 0.991.\n\n\nFig. (1). CD-RISC CFA Result: Non-Normed Fit Index = .903; Comparative Fit Index = .917; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.069; Chi-square = 562.104; Degrees of Freedom = 197.\nAs for PTGI, the CFA result showed that the adaptation of the PTGI scale had a good Model Fit (GFI = .904, CFI = .913, RMSEA = .063) with standardized items’ loading factors ranging from 0.584 to 0.785, as seen in Fig. (2). Furthermore, the Alpha Cronbach Reliability test’s results showed that the adaptation of the CD-RISC scale and PTGI have good reliability with CD-RISC’s alpha score, which was .927 and .931, respectively.\n\n\nFig. (2). PTGI CFA Result: Non-Normed Fit Index .917; Comparative Fit Index = .913; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = .063; Chi-square = 378.533; Degrees of Freedom = 158.\nTo obtain the mean and SD for each variable, bivariate correlation tests were executed to test the correlation between each variable in the research. Based on the data findings, a significant negative correlation between ACE and resilience was found (r = - .202). A similar correlation but weaker result was shown amongst the ACE and PTG (r = - .187). In addition, it is shown in Table 2 that all of the resilience factors are significantly associated with ACEs, Post-Traumatic Growth, and all of their aspects. Meanwhile, not all aspects of Post-Traumatic Growth showed a statistically significant correlation with ACEs. This means that even though ACE was related to PTG to some extent, a stronger correlation was shown between ACE and resilience. That makes this finding support the offered model. Concerning the relationship between resilience and PTG, the correlation test result showed a significantly positive relationship.\n\nTable 2.\nPearson’s product moment correlation between research variables and factors.\nNo.\tVariable\tM\tSD\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t7\t8\t9\t10\t11\t12\t13\n1.\tTotal PTG\t69.96\t13.79\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2.\tRelating to Others\t24.88\t5.36\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n3.\tNew Possibilities\t17.26\t3.82\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n4.\tPersonal Strength\t13.96\t3.14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n5.\tSpiritual Changes\t6.72\t1.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n6.\tAppreciation to Life\t7.14\t1.75\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n7.\tTotal Resilience\t61.64\t11.96\t.566*\t.463**\t.522**\t.519**\t.417**\t.498**\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n8.\tFactor 1: Personal Competence, High Standard, and Tenacity\t23.11\t4.74\t.569**\t.469**\t.544**\t.515**\t.393**\t.492**\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n9.\tFactor 2: Trust in One’s Instinct, Tolerance to Negative Effect, Strengthening Effects of Stress\t17.90\t4.25\t.464**\t.357**\t.449**\t.441*\t.340**\t.407**\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n10.\tFactor 3: Positive Acceptance of Changes and Secure Relationship\t5.58\t1.87\t.348**\t.300**\t.261**\t.341**\t.292**\t.314**\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n11.\tFactor 4: Control\t8.61\t1.94\t.464**\t.397**\t.420**\t.422**\t.316**\t.405**\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n12.\tFactor 5: Spiritual Influences\t6.42\t1.37\t.399**\t.338**\t.333**\t.317**\t.383**\t.377*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n13.\tTotal ACE\t1.46\t.879\t-.187**\t-.188**\t-.166**\t-.155**\t-.085\t-.159**\t-.202*\t-.138*\t-.179**\t-.162**\t-.169**\t-.269**\t-.187**\nNote: * = sig <.05 ; ** = sig <.01 (two-tailed).\nTo test the hypotheses, the researcher used Structural Equation based analysis with all 349 participants using AMOS software. Based on the data analysis, the offered hypothetical model in this research indicated a good fit with the data collected (Fig. 3). The CFI score was .997, TLI was .96, and RMSEA was .065. ACE was shown to have a significantly negative relationship towards resilience (standardized coefficient = -.19) and a non-significantly negative relationship towards PTG (standardized coefficient = .61). This research proposed a hypothesis that the correlation between ACE and PTG has an indirect effect relationship with mediated resilience. Fortunately, this research supported the hypothesis because it revealed a significant indirect correlation between ACE and PTG through resilience (standardized indirect coefficient = -.12). Moreover, the proposed model plot revealed by the analysis result showed a higher total effect in comparison to the direct effect (standardized total coefficient = -.192).\n\nIn order to confirm the mediating effects of each factor of resilience, in this research, we used Hayes’ (2013) PROCESS software based on the proposed mediation model. PROCESS uses a path analytical framework and bootstrapping to provide powerful estimates of direct and indirect effects in mediation models. We altered the initial mediating variable, resilience, into its factors. The total effect of collectivism on environmental quality was significant, β = -.19, SE = .828, p = .000, 95% CI (-4.56, -1.30), as seen in Fig. (4). The result, as shown in Fig. (5), thus, implies that Factor 1 (Personal Competence, High Standard, Tenacity) has no mediating effects on the relation between ACEs and PTG. The direct effect controlling for Factor 1 of resilience was also significant but smaller in size, β = -.11, SE = .69, p = .013, 95% CI (-3.09, -.36), and the associated indirect effect was nonsignificant, β = -.08, SE = .041, 95% CI (-.16, .002).\n\n\nFig. (3).

In detail, Factor 2, as shown in Fig. (6) (Trust in One’s Instinct, Tolerance to Negative Affect, Strengthening Effects of Stress), 3, as in Fig. (7), (Positive Acceptance of Changes and Secure Relationship), and 4, as shown in Fig. (8), (Control) showed partial mediating effects while Factor 5 (Spiritual Changes) showed full mediating effect, as shown in Fig. (9). The direct effect control for Factor 2 of resilience was significant but smaller in size, β = -.11, SE = .75, p = .027, 95% CI (-3.16, -.19), and the associated indirect effect was also significant, β = -.08, SE = .036, 95% CI (-.15, -.01). The result of direct effect control for Factor 3 of resilience was also shown significant but smaller in size, β = -.13, SE = .79, p = .008, 95% CI (-3.66, -.54), and the associated indirect effect was also significant, β = -.05, SE = .023, 95% CI (-.10, -.01). Showing a similar pattern, the direct effect control for Factor 4 of the resilience was significant but smaller in size, β = -.11, SE = .75, p = .020, 95% CI (-3.24, -.27), and the associated indirect effect was also significant, β = -.08, SE = .027, 95% CI (-.13, -.03). There is, however, a slightly different result in the direct effect control for Factor 5 of resilience, which was nonsignificant, β = -.09, SE = .80, p = .093, 95% CI (-2.92, .22), and the associated indirect effect that was significant, β = -.10, SE = .048, 95% CI (-.19, -.03).The summary of the beta effects of each factor is presented in Table 3 below.\n\n\nFig. (6).

DISCUSSION\n\nThis research was conducted to reveal the correlation between ACEs, resilience, and PTG. The proposed hypothesis was that ACEs were related to the PTG experienced by the individuals. The correlation test’s results showed that ACEs, indeed, had a significant correlation with PTG. This was in line with the research conducted by Schubert et al. [21], who believed that individuals experiencing hardships in their family had a correlation with PTG achievement. Bad experiences in childhood have positively predicted PTG in children [22]. Another study showed a similar result, like the study conducted by Shand et al. [23]. They found a similar result in their study, whereby individuals who experienced bad times in childhood did not always have a negative impact when they grew up. Many children could have had a stronger personality and could have been empowered by resilience. That study result supported this recent research, where ACEs were experienced by individuals in the past and had a significant correlation with the individuals’ level of resilience. All of the previous research reviewed revealed a connection amongst variables, which was explained by the details that ACEs had a significant correlation with resilience and PTG. The stronger correlation between resilience and PTG indicated that the relation ACEs had with PTG was mediated by resilience, like how it was hypothesized from other studies.\n\nFurther analysis using SEM showed that ACEs were insignificantly impacted directly by resilience. This result supported some arguments proposed by some related studies, whereby ACEs as experiences could not be the only predictor of psychological problems (including PTG as a positive growth) without going through other processes [24, 25]. In other words, to reach a certain level of PTG, individuals need to cope with post-trauma stress through a cognitive learning process aided by resilience as one of the internal models [7], [21, 23]. The findings and theoretical background have helped the offered model in this research, where resilience works as the mediator that increases the significant indirect impact of ACEs towards PTG.\n\nTheoretically, the increased PTG was related to the dimensions of resilience, which later will increase PTG or benefit finding along with psychological growth to a positive side because of the experience obtained from ACEs or other hurdles to achieve a higher functional level [17]. Another argument conveyed by Malhotra and Chebiyyam [26], who did a study on PTG as a result of bad events in life, could be concluded that the growth was a result from the struggle to prevent the traumatic experience and how the individuals find a meaningful life, which sprang not from the bad experience itself. The process to prevent that crisis or the traumatic event had been predicted by the resilience that the individuals owned, as concluded by Tranteret al. [27]. This explanation, then, may describe how resilience played the role of a mediator between the ACEs and PTG that the individuals were experiencing.\n\nFurthermore, we also found that some aspects of PTG were significantly associated with ACEs, although it was then revealed that resilience plays a partial mediation role in the relationship of those two variables. ACEs as traumatic events occur during childhood, and they are more likely to be part of a person's identity, which serves as a developmental basis for understanding, thinking, and reacting to living circumstances [20]. However, since the self is complex and constructed, individuals have a choice in the formation of their identity. Thus, adults are not destined to have the self-concept of their childhood [28]. When a person experiences personal development by facing the difficulties of his life, that person will have a broader perspective on the development of personal resources [7, 29].\n\nIn a more detailed analysis, the results showed that personal competence, high standard, and tenacity factors did not provide a mediating effect on the relationship between ACEs and PTG levels. Qualitative research among Indonesian people showed that strong spiritual factors and social support affect PTG more than confidence in self-strength [30]. This is due to the more collective type of Indonesian society, which does not give too much encouragement for the individual self-confidence to grow after traumatic events. In addition, another factor of resilience, which is spiritual influence, actually provides the strongest mediation effect on the relationship between ACEs and PTG in the Indonesian community. These results support previous research on PTG in Indonesian and Asian communities by showing that spirituality and religious activity significantly predict PTG levels in survivors of natural disasters [31, 32]. Actually, not only in the face of traumatic events, Subandi et al. [32] explained that in facing difficulties, in general, Indonesian people in Java, who are Muslims, adopt more religious and/ or spiritual coping techniques, such as dhikr (doing remembrance rituals to God), salat (doing daily prayer), sabar (be patient), nrimo (be warmly accepting things), tawakkal (ready to surrender), and bersyukur (give gratitude).\n\nThis study provides supporting evidence and new knowledge regarding the relationship of ACEs as traumatic events from the past (outside the context of natural disasters in previous studies) with the PTG level of the Indonesian society. It is strongly mediated by spirituality, which is a factor of resilience as a complete mediator. In more detail, Akbar [33] explained how spirituality is believed to be sacred by the people of Indonesia and can encourage positive growth by providing a sense of security and deeper meaning to the painful events experienced.\n\n4.1. Limitations\n\nEven though the research could reveal the result that depicted the role of resilience in ACEs and PTG correlation clearly, this research had some limitations that could be overcome further in the next research. Firstly, participants of the current study included a wide age range and seemed not evenly distributed (mostly early adulthood and incorporated the small data of elder participants). However, despite a wide age range, data gathered are all, in fact, statistically normally distributed, so the authors decided to include the whole dataset in order to capture growth experienced by participants from different generations. Second, this research aimed to investigate the role of resilience as a mediator, while other researchers believed that there were lots of different factors that may protect and support in time of post-trauma crisis [34-36]. Therefore, future research could investigate other factors that may be the mediators between PTG and ACEs, which would provide a bigger picture of the phenomenon. Data of this research only represented what happened in Indonesia with Indonesian participants. Thus, there is still a need to do further research to involve a wider population considering the cultural and social aspects through theoretical reviews and other similar research.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis article revealed an association between the ACE that the individual experienced in the past with resilience and PTG. ACE was found to have a significant correlation with the level of PTG someone was experiencing, but the direct impact of ACE was not significant towards the PTG if it stands alone. Resilience was found to become the mediator of individuals experiencing PTG after going through ACE.",

Cultural Context Matters**\n\n- **Spirituality in Indonesian Culture:**\n  - The study highlights that in Indonesian society, spirituality plays a significant role in resilience and PTG.\n  - Spiritual practices and beliefs are integral in coping with trauma and fostering growth.\n- **Collectivist Society:**\n  - In collectivist cultures like Indonesia, social support and communal values influence the development of resilience and PTG.\n\n---\n\n**Updating Our Model**\n\n**1. Incorporating Resilience as a Central Mediator**\n\n- **Previous Model:**\n  - Focused on factors like self-efficacy, deliberate rumination, gratitude, and social support in facilitating PTG.\n- **Updated Model:**\n  - **Resilience as a Core Mediator:** Recognize resilience as a key mediator between trauma (e.g., ACEs) and PTG.\n  - **Pathway:**\n    - **Trauma (ACEs) ➔ Resilience ➔ PTG**\n    - Trauma does not directly lead to PTG; rather, it is through the development of resilience that individuals experience growth.\n\n**2. Recognizing the Multifaceted Nature of Resilience**\n\n- **Differential Impact of Resilience Factors:**\n  - Different aspects of resilience contribute variably to PTG.\n  - **Emphasize Spirituality:** Given its significant mediating effect, spirituality should be considered an important component of resilience in the model.\n- **Cultural Sensitivity:**\n  - Acknowledge that cultural factors influence how resilience is developed and expressed.\n  - **Tailor Interventions:** Adapt strategies to fit the cultural context of the individuals or groups being supported.\n\n**3. Integrating Spirituality and Cultural Values**\n\n- **Spiritual Influences:**\n  - Incorporate spiritual practices and beliefs as mechanisms for building resilience.\n- **Community and Social Support:**\n  - Leverage communal relationships and social networks to enhance resilience and facilitate PTG.\n\n**4. Refining the Role of Self-Efficacy and Other Factors**\n\n- **Self-Efficacy within Resilience:**\n  - View self-efficacy as a component or outcome of resilience.\n- **Holistic Approach:**\n  - Combine psychological factors (self-efficacy, coping styles) with social (support networks) and spiritual elements in building resilience.\n\n---\n\n**Implications for Training Programs to Promote PTG**\n\n**1. Focus on Building Resilience**\n\n- **Resilience Training:**\n  - Design programs that specifically aim to enhance resilience among participants.\n  - Include activities that strengthen coping mechanisms, adaptability, and stress tolerance.\n- **Personal Competence and Tenacity:**\n  - Even though this factor did not mediate the ACEs-PTG relationship in the study, fostering personal competence can still be beneficial.\n\n**2.

      "content": "**Understanding the Strongest Aspects of Resilience Related to Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) and Integrating Resilience into the Curriculum**\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**\n\nResilience is a critical factor in transforming adverse experiences into opportunities for growth, known as Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG). Based on the study by Widyorini et al., certain aspects of resilience have a stronger influence on PTG than others. Understanding these aspects can help educators and program designers incorporate resilience-building strategies into curricula effectively and seamlessly.\n\n---\n\n**Strongest Aspects of Resilience Related to PTG**\n\nThe study utilized the **Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)**, which identifies five factors of resilience:\n\n1. **Personal Competence, High Standards, and Tenacity**\n2. **Trust in One's Instincts, Tolerance of Negative Affect, and Strengthening Effects of Stress**\n3. **Positive Acceptance of Change and Secure Relationships**\n4. **Control**\n5. **Spiritual Influences**\n\n**Findings on Mediating Effects:**\n\n- **Spiritual Influences (Factor 5):** Demonstrated a **full mediating effect** between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and PTG.\n- **Trust in One's Instincts (Factor 2):** Showed a **partial mediating effect**.\n- **Positive Acceptance of Change and Secure Relationships (Factor 3):** Exhibited a **partial mediating effect**.\n- **Control (Factor 4):** Also had a **partial mediating effect**.\n- **Personal Competence (Factor 1):** Did **not** show a significant mediating effect.\n\n**Strongest Aspects:**\n\n1. **Spiritual Influences (Factor 5)**\n2. **Trust in One's Instincts, Tolerance of Negative Affect, and Strengthening Effects of Stress (Factor 2)**\n3. **Positive Acceptance of Change and Secure Relationships (Factor 3)**\n4. **Control (Factor 4)**\n\n---\n\n**Why These Aspects Are the Strongest**\n\n**1. Spiritual Influences (Factor 5)**\n\n- **Meaning-Making and Coping Mechanism:**\n  - Spirituality provides a framework for individuals to make sense of traumatic experiences.\n  - It offers a source of comfort, hope, and meaning, which are essential for healing and growth.\n- **Cultural Significance:**\n  - In many cultures, including the Indonesian context of the study, spirituality is deeply ingrained in daily life and coping strategies.\n  - Spiritual practices like prayer, meditation, and community worship strengthen social bonds and provide communal support.\n- **Holistic Healing:**\n  - Addresses not just the psychological but also the emotional and existential dimensions of trauma.\n  - Encourages forgiveness, gratitude, and compassion, which facilitate PTG.\n\n**2. Trust in One's Instincts, Tolerance of Negative Affect, and Strengthening Effects of Stress (Factor 2)**\n\n- **Intuition and Self-Confidence:**\n  - Trusting one's instincts empowers individuals to make decisions that align with their well-being.\n- **Emotional Regulation:**\n  - Tolerance of negative emotions enables individuals to process and move through painful feelings without becoming overwhelmed.\n- **Stress as a Catalyst:**\n  - Viewing stress as strengthening allows individuals to perceive challenges as opportunities for growth rather than threats.\n\n**3. Positive Acceptance of Change and Secure Relationships (Factor 3)**\n\n- **Adaptability:**\n  - Acceptance of change helps individuals adjust to new realities post-trauma.\n- **Social Support:**\n  - Secure relationships provide emotional support, practical assistance, and a sense of belonging.\n  - Strong social networks are consistently linked to better recovery outcomes.\n\n**4. Control (Factor 4)**\n\n- **Perceived Control:**\n  - Feeling a sense of control over one's life enhances agency and motivation.\n  - Encourages proactive coping strategies and goal-directed behavior.\n\n**Why These Aspects Are Strongest:**\n\n- **Interconnectedness:**\n  - These factors are interrelated and collectively contribute to an individual's ability to transform adversity into growth.\n- **Cultural Alignment:**\n  - They resonate with universal human experiences and can be adapted across different cultural contexts.\n- **Empirical Support:**\n  - Multiple studies have highlighted the importance of these factors in resilience and PTG.\n\n---\n\n**Streamlined Ways to Incorporate Resilience into the Curriculum**\n\nIntegrating resilience into the curriculum does not require a complete overhaul of existing programs.
