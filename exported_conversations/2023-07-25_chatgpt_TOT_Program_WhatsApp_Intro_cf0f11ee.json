I am trying to get a training of trainers ecosystem formed and people aren't responding. So i intend to send them a whatsapp video message with this information individually, can you help me write the script based on these attempts:\nPlease join us for our Training the Trainers (TOT) program on August 10. To prepare, we need to collect data to understand the ecosystem and your needs for the TOT. This will help us create a work plan together in two weeks.\nTake the assessment, join our community platform, introduce yourself, and get ready for our first of three training programs. Your participation is vital as this data about well-being needs will guide our advocacy efforts.\nWe also encourage you to ask colleagues at work or university about their well-being needs. This insight can help shape specific programs that address particular needs within Lebanon's social entrepreneurship ecosystem.\nFeel free to share questions or ideas with me through WhatsApp; I'm considering starting a group there since other tools like email aren't proving effective.\nRemember: take the assessment before joining us in two weeks at the event – it is crucial for your continued involvement in the program.\nHi, I'd like to share some important information with you. We're conducting a mapping survey that needs to be completed by August 10th. Although we initially avoided WhatsApp for privacy reasons, we've realized email isn't quite enough for our communication needs. Therefore, we'll be forming a WhatsApp group for better engagement.\n\nPlease join the community page and schedule an onboarding call with me as soon as possible. Your participation in completing assessments is vital to this project's success — it's all about improving our environment's well-being.\n\nBy the second TOT session, I hope to have more content from your assessments which will help us understand the broader picture of what's happening in our programs.\n\nDuring this time frame, we'll also focus on personal well-being practices within our organization and share these findings across teams during outreach activities. As part of this process, we'll match team members based on their well-being needs and gather best practices.\n\nIn month two, similar activities will take place but focused specifically on groups within our organizations. The third month will involve research and analysis aimed at expanding our impact through improved wellness strategies while hosting additional activities.\n\nWe'll wrap up everything with a grand celebration! Hope you're having a great day!\n",
