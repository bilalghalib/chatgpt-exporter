      "content": "Yes, it is possible to use Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) with multiple domains. You do not need separate Google Workspace accounts for each domain. Instead, you can add multiple domains to a single Google Workspace account. There are two ways to manage multiple domains in Google Workspace:\n\n1. **Adding a Domain Alias**: This is suitable if you want users at different domains to have the same email inbox. For instance, if you own both `example.com` and `example.net`, you can set up `example.net` as an alias of `example.com`. Emails sent to `user@example.net` will be delivered to the inbox of `user@example.com`.\n\n2. **Adding a Secondary Domain**: If you want the users at the different domains to have separate email inboxes, you can add a secondary domain to your Google Workspace account. Users at the secondary domain will have separate accounts from those at the primary domain. For example, `user@example.com` and `user@example.net` will be two different users with their own inboxes.\n\nIt's important to note that all domains within the Google Workspace account will share the same Google services, such as Drive, Calendar, and Meet. The billing is also centralized, so you don't need separate subscriptions for each domain.\n\nTo add a domain to your Google Workspace account, you'll need to verify ownership of the domain and then configure it within your Google Workspace admin console. The process involves updating DNS records for your domain, so you'll need access to your domain's DNS settings. Once configured, you can manage users, groups, and services across all your domains from a single admin console.",
