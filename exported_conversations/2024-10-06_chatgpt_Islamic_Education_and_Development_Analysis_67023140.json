He has written this article:\nThe Revival of Islam: The Central Role of Islamic Educational System\nAsad Zaman\n \nIntroduction\nAllah's final message lifted the Arabs from the depths of degradation and led them to world leadership. Through this knowledge, they laid the foundation of a civilization whose light illuminated the world for nearly a thousand years. These glorious tales of our brilliant past are in dramatic contrast with our current conditions. Today, the world has become a slaughterhouse for millions of Muslims, while we are helpless spectators. What is the cause of this severe decline? For the past century, thinkers have been offering various diagnoses for our disease, and corresponding solutions. Many different remedies have been proposed, ranging from the propagation of Islam, implementation of Shariah, emphasis on Jihad, or the restoration of the Caliphate. Despite all these efforts, the condition of the Ummah has gone from bad to worse.\nThe real cause of our current decline is an extraordinary event unparalleled in the history of Muslims. In the 19th century, the Western powers established dominance over approximately 85% of the world's nations, and the same proportion of Muslim countries also came under their rule. For such extensive control, armies alone were not sufficient; it was also necessary the minds of the masses, so that millions of people would not even entertain the thought of rebellion against a handful of rulers. In creating this slavish mentality, the educational system played a central role.\nLord Macaulay abolished the traditional educational systems of India and introduced an alternative Western educational system with the explicit purpose of creating respect and admiration for the West while promoting contempt and hatred for local traditions. Through this education, a class emerged that helped the British plunder their own nation. Today, Western dominance over the world has ended, but this pro-Western class still holds power over Islamic countries. The Western educational system is crucial element of the soft power required for this minority to rule the masses. As a result, this educational system is still in place in all Islamic countries today. As long as this system continues to instill in our youth a sense of reverence for the West and disdain for their own culture and religious traditions, the revival of Islam will remain a distant dream.\nTo change the future of Islamic societies, we must transform our educational system. At present, throughout the Islamic world, our youth are trapped in the grips of Western education— an education that sings the praises of the West and erases all the achievements of Islamic civilization from the pages of history. Through this education, our youth learn that Western knowledge is superior to all other forms of knowledge and that Western civilization is the most advanced and magnificent civilization in human history. This notion is entirely contrary to Islamic teachings, which tell us that the knowledge of the Quran is superior to all other knowledge and that the most advanced and developed society was the one that emerged from the teachings of our Prophet (peace be upon him) fourteen centuries ago.\nAmong those working for the revival of Islam, only one group has recognized the central role of education. These thinkers have attempted to remove the pro-Western elements from Western knowledge and shape it within an Islamic framework. However, despite fifty years of effort, this Islamization of Knowledge project has not been successful. In this essay, we will examine the reasons for this failure and propose an alternative strategy through which current educational institutions can not only foster an Islamic mindset in our youth and protect them from Westernization but also allow them to benefit from modern education.\n2. Sources and Impacts of Secular Knowledge\nThe belief that knowledge is universal and transcends geographical boundaries turns the term \"secular knowledge\" into a misconception. However, studying the evolution of knowledge helps clear this misconception. In the 16th century, Europeans considered the Bible to be the ultimate truth. By the 18th century, religious knowledge had become a private matter, and only those ideas that could be empirically proven were accepted as common and public knowledge. This transformation led to the creation of what we now call secular knowledge.\nSecular knowledge claims to be based on facts and logic, equally acceptable to all religions. Western civilization asserts that it is superior to all other civilizations because it has created this unique form of knowledge, which is superior to all types of knowledge ever produced by humanity. Muslims, by and large, have accepted this claim that secular knowledge is based solely on facts and logic, and is equally acceptable to all rational and truth-seeking individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs. For this reason, the spread of Western education in the Islamic world was not met with much opposition. In fact, a large section of Muslims considers this education to be the path to salvation and believes that the absence of this education is the reason for the current decline of Muslims. The first objective of this essay is to make it clear that the claim of secular knowledge is false. In reality, the foundation of secular knowledge is the denial of religion. This poisonous element hidden in Western education was recognized by our elders, and that is why the scholars of the Islamic madrasas have avoided this knowledge to this day. As Allama Iqbal wrote (translated):\n\"We thought education would bring peace; who knew that atheism would come along with it?\"\nThese Western sciences claim superiority over Quranic knowledge and are misleading our Muslim youth in various ways. Our Quran too claims its superiority and challenges others to produce even a single verse comparable to it. We must step into the intellectual arena, reject the deceptive claims of Western education, and prove the far greater superiority of Quranic knowledge. This is the subject of our essay: how can we achieve this goal?\n3. Eurocentric History: The Enlightenment\nThe foundations of Western education are based on the following concepts regarding human history:\nThe Enlightenment movement began in Europe in the 17th Century, and led to an astonishing expansion in humanity's collective knowledge. The sun of reason rose upon the West, and in its light, the people of the West realized that all of humanity had been shackled by the chains of superstitions, passed down from generation to generation. Traditional humans lacked the courage to think independently, neither producing new ideas nor questioning old errors. Enlightenment intellectuals decided that from now on, all knowledge, whether religious or worldly, must be tested on the criterion of reason. Consequently, the knowledge that proved to be true in the light of reason and observation would be accepted, while the rest would be rejected. In this way, they rebuilt all of human knowledge on the foundations of reason and observation. From this perspective, it appears that all the knowledge of the modern era has been created by the people of the West. Since this Western conception of knowledge clashes with Islamic beliefs, we will refer to it as \"secular knowledge\" in this essay.\nThe people of the West claim that these secular sciences are unparalleled in the entire history of humanity. It is through these sciences that they have conquered the world, inventing a variety of astonishing devices that continue to impact human life moment by moment. Because of their spectacular innovations in all fields of knowledge, they have achieved the status of the most advanced civilization in the world. Today, if any nation wants to progress, it must acquire these Western sciences. Progress itself means adopting the sciences and societal norms of the West.\n4. The Dominance of the Western Narrative\nThe story of the Enlightenment is deeply embedded in every aspect of the Western educational system. Every student who receives modern education spends many years studying only the sciences developed by the West, with no mention of Islamic teachings. Such education reinforces the Western narrative that only Western knowledge can meet the needs of the modern world, while Islamic knowledge has become completely irrelevant in contemporary times.\nIt is obvious that this claim by the West directly conflicts with fundamental Islamic teachings. It was the knowledge given by Allah that pulled humanity out of the darkness of ignorance and superstition. The light of this knowledge illuminated the entire world for a thousand years. This knowledge is sufficient to guide us until the Day of Judgment. Even today, we have no need to ask for guidance from foreign nations. While we maintain this belief based on faith, we are unable to provide the evidence required to support it. The overwhelming majority of the Ummah spends their lives in pursuit of these Western sciences. Very few people study Islamic knowledge, and even those who do are not able to apply it to solve modern problems. In this way, the actions of the Ummah also become a testimony to the superiority of Western knowledge.\nThere is an African proverb that: \"Until the lions have their own historians, the tales of the hunt will always glorify the hunters.\"  We must re-examine European history from an Islamic perspective and consider whether this is a story of progress and advancement, or the story of decline and degeneration. The claim of Western superiority over all nations resembles the claim of the people of 'Aad: \"Who is mightier than us in strength?\" From an Islamic perspective, a critical examination of Western history can expose the falsehood of such claims.\n5. Secular Knowledge: Born out of Devastating Religious Wars\nTo understand secular knowledge, it is essential to understand the historical background in which this knowledge was born. The period from the 4th to the 14th century AD is known as the \"Dark Ages\" of Europe, during which knowledge in Europe was almost nonexistent. At the same time, the message of Islam ignited a thirst for knowledge among Muslims. They gathered knowledge from all over the world and made remarkable progress in every field of learning. Ibn Khaldun, in his study of history, mentions an ancient principle: when nations reach their peak, they fall into luxury and indulgence. This very indulgence becomes the prelude to their downfall, leading neighboring barbarian tribes to attack and loot their treasures. Similarly, when the seven-century-old civilization of Al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) fell into the grip of luxury and indulgence in its later years, neighboring Christian tribes eventually recaptured Spain. With this conquest, millions of books from Andalusian libraries fell into their hands. The unique teachings of the Quran had made Muslims passionate about knowledge, and the vast intellectual treasures they had accumulated from around the world were what ended the dark ages of the West and lit the lamp of knowledge in Europe.\nThe Catholic Church maintained its grip on Europe for a thousand years by keeping the masses ignorant and confining knowledge within the walls of the Church. The flood of knowledge posed a great threat to the Church because it contradicted its teachings. The Church made every effort to suppress this knowledge, imposing strict restrictions on translations. No book could be published without the Church's permission and seal. Under the Church's authority, a terrifying institution called the Inquisition was established. This institution was created to stop the spread of ideas that were contrary to the Church's accepted doctrines. Anyone who expressed or wrote such ideas faced severe punishments, torture, and imprisonment.\nThe Church's efforts to dam the flood of knowledge led to divisions within the Church itself. The Protestant faction rejected the authority of the Catholic Church, and its centuries-old traditions, in order to create space for new forms of knowledge. Following this split, a series of extremely bloody and destructive wars erupted between these two factions, which continued for centuries. The growth of secular knowledge in Europe was profoundly shaped by the devastating impact of these religious wars. This violence forced many prominent Western thinkers to flee, while others lived under the constant threat of the Church's inquisition.\nBecause of these centuries of religious wars and the bitter personal experiences they endured, the founders of the Enlightenment concluded that society could not be built on religious foundations. They insisted that the social sciences must be based solely on reason and observation, so that everyone could agree upon them. It was not that, suddenly in the 17th century, the sun of reason rose from Europe for the first time; rather, the Enlightenment was an intellectual search for the foundations of a peaceful society. As we will see later in this essay, this search did not succeed. Due to several fundamental mistakes made by the Enlightenment thinkers, the cycle of destructive wars not only continued but intensified. Even today, the world is still searching for that peaceful society, the method for which was taught to us fourteen centuries ago. Unfortunately, Muslims have been removed from the position of global leadership and are unable to present a model for a peaceful society. This essay has been written to investigate the reasons for this tragedy and to search for its solution.\nFor nearly two centuries, the champions of the Enlightenment engaged in a struggle against the scholastic school of thought, who wanted to build society on religious foundations. In this intellectual battle, the Enlightenment ultimately emerged victorious, and the scholastics were defeated. Over the past two to three centuries, all secular Western sciences have been developed on the principles of the Enlightenment. However, since the Enlightenment itself was founded on mistaken assumptions, these faulty assumptions have permeated all secular sciences. Western education teaches our students to believe in these incorrect assumptions, which conflict with Islamic teachings. This is why it is now imperative for the future of the Ummah to develop an Islamic educational system as an alternative to Western education.\n6. The Incorrect Assumptions of the Enlightenment\nA long list can be made of the incorrect assumptions of the Enlightenment. European intellectuals believed that religious differences were the root cause of ongoing civil wars. They thought that if knowledge were confined to reason and observation, these differences would disappear, and a peaceful society would emerge. Moreover, because this knowledge would be based on reason and observation, it would be absolutely true, free from any errors, and universally accepted by all rational individuals. Some of the fundamental flaws in these assumptions are outlined below:\n1. The religious wars in the West were not actually fought over religion but for power, wealth, and dominance. The greatest proof of this is that even after the ideas of the Enlightenment gained widespread acceptance and societies were established on secular foundations, wars did not decrease; rather, they increased.\n2. The idea that all human knowledge can be restructured purely on the basis of reason and observation is incorrect. There are many fields of knowledge where reason and observation cannot reach. In these fields, instead of progress, secular knowledge in the West experienced decline. This will be discussed in more detail later.\n3. It is also a misconception that “absolute truth” can be attained solely through reason and observation. A thousand years ago, Imam Ghazali had already reached the conclusion in his famous treatise Al-Munqidh min ad-Dalal. He showed arrive at any knowledge through reason and observation, certain metaphysical assumptions must first be accepted, and these assumptions lie beyond reason and observation. Secular thinkers continue to claim that their knowledge is universally accepted and absolutely true, even though this claim can easily be disproven. Moreover, a web of propaganda has been woven, which keeps these assumptions hidden from view. Because of this, even religious people accept this knowledge, unaware of the concealed atheistic foundations.\n4. Since the goal of the Enlightenment thinkers was to create knowledge that everyone could agree upon, they confined observation to the external world only. If a person observes their inner state, the knowledge obtained from such observation has no place in secular knowledge because this inner experience cannot be definitively known to anyone else. As a result, knowledge was divided into two parts. Secular thinkers allowed every individual the freedom to think whatever they want about their inner world and to believe in any ideology or religion they wished. However, knowledge about the external world must conform to secular principles. Thus, Christianity became limited to a personal belief system, and society was structured on secular foundations. Secular thinkers excluded spiritual knowledge from the realm of knowledge.\nThe current Western education system is based on secular epistemology built on these flawed foundations. Without correcting these four errors, we cannot create an Islamic alternative to Western education. How can this be done? The next four sections of this essay will explain these four misconceptions in detail, in corresponding sequence. By correcting these mistakes, we can develop an Islamic educational system that will surpass any educational system currently available in the world. Such a system will also serve as a clear demonstration of the superiority of Islamic knowledge.\n7. The Need for an Islamic Analysis of History\nIt is said that history is merely the conquest song of the victors. When reading most Western historical books, it seems as though the world was shrouded in darkness before the rise of the West. Apart from the ancient Greeks, (also considered as Europeans), no other nation had accomplished anything of note before the Enlightenment of Europe. Since their rise in the 17th century, Western nations have made astonishing progress in every field of knowledge and action, unprecedented in human history. Europeans reached the moon and are now reaching for the stars, leaving all others behind in the dust. Even if not explicitly stated, such ideas underlie much of Western education. Naturally, if a student learns such lessons, it becomes difficult for them to believe in Islam’s fundamental tenets—especially the belief that the knowledge given by Allah surpasses all human knowledge, just as Allah Himself surpasses all of His creation. It also challenges the belief that the time of our Prophet was the best of times, and the society formed under his leadership was the best society.\nToday’s Western thinkers regard the past three centuries as the period of greatest progress in human history and attribute their advancement to the rejection of religious traditions and the insistence on reason. The Quran, however, tells us that those who deny God will be deprived of the light of true knowledge and will be driven into darkness. To affirm this Quranic narrative, we must reject the West-centric histories and create an alternative narrative. Seventy years ago, Syed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi laid the foundation for such a narrative in his renowned book Maza Khasira al-‘Alam bi Inhitat al-Muslimeen (What the World Lost Due to the Decline of Muslims). However, there has not been sufficient progress based on this foundation, and there is a pressing need for further development.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the West had control over approximately 85% of the world. But after the massive bloodshed of World War I and World War II, Western powers were weakened, and most of the countries under their control gained independence. As the West’s dominance waned, many books began to emerge that strongly refuted the pro-Western historical narratives. A few important books in this regard, which should be included in educational curricula, are listed below. Translating these books and incorporating them into the curricula of Islamic educational institutions would be a significant step forward in the process of Islamizing knowledge.\n1. Edward Said, in his famous book Orientalism, examines how the West has portrayed the Islamic world in a highly negative light. All virtues were attributed to the West, while all vices were associated with the East. This sense of superiority permeates Western intellectual and literary productions such as dramas, novels, history, and the social sciences. Said argues that these concepts have no connection to reality; rather, they are the result of the West’s global dominance over the East, which gave rise to a sense of superiority in the West. Through this analysis, Said demonstrates how these perceptions maintain a system of power and oppression that benefits the West and weakens the East by instilling a sense of inferiority and dependence.\n2. Stavrianos, in his book Global Rift, writes that many pro-Western historical accounts chronicle the West’s remarkable rise and attribute its success to the West’s creativity, intelligence, scientific achievements, honesty, integrity, hard work, and respect for legal rights. Conversely, the poverty and backwardness of the East are explained by the absence of these noble qualities. This narrative is far from the truth. Stavrianos explains that the West engaged in colonial exploitation in the East, looting its resources and wealth. According to a recent research paper, during British colonial rule, Britain looted approximately 45 trillion US dollars worth of wealth from India. This large-scale plundering was the cause of the West’s prosperity and the East’s poverty.\nThe Causes of Western Global Dominance:\nStavrianos’s analysis raises a natural question: If the West is not superior to the rest of the world, how did it manage to defeat all other nations? One answer was given a thousand years ago by Ibn Khaldun, who explained that barbaric tribes often overcome developed but declining civilizations. Genghis Khan did not defeat the Muslims because of his virtuous character but due to his extreme savagery and brutality. Another answer is that after centuries of extremely bloody wars among themselves, Western nations became highly skilled in the art of warfare. Additionally, secular knowledge freed them from the moral values of their religion. Secular thinkers believed that humans are a type of animal, and the law of evolution dictates that the strong should tear apart and consume the weak. According to secular political thinkers, every means and trick to gain power is justified, even if it involves committing the greatest of wrongs, such as swearing false oaths, killing millions of innocent people, enslaving millions by force, or making profits by selling harmful and addictive substances. The phrase \"All is fair in love and war\" is their invention, meaning that no moral barriers should stand in the way of acquiring pleasure or wealth. This freedom from moral constraints greatly helped them conquer the world.\n3. Theft of History: In his book Theft of History, Jack Goody explains how the West has stolen the accomplishments of other civilizations and claimed them as its own. This is why Western historical accounts only seem to highlight their successes. On this subject, Chandrakant Raju’s book Is Science Western in Origin? is eye-opening. Due to the Crusades, enmity and hatred toward Muslims had taken root in the hearts of Europe’s Christians. They acquired knowledge on a large scale from Muslim books but attributed these ideas either to the Greeks or to Western plagiarists. This is why Western thinkers' progress appears so astounding—they stamped their name on six centuries of Muslim progress. Raju provides several examples of plagiarists, such as Copernicus. Copernicus is still regarded as a revolutionary thinker, even though he merely translated the astronomical work of Ibn al-Shatir. He could not acknowledge this due to the severe punishments imposed by the Church for presenting the ideas of Muslims.\n4. Unmasking Eurocentric Historians: James M. Blaut’s book Eight Eurocentric Historians exposes the bias and prejudice in the historical narratives of Western historians. This book analyzes the thoughts of eight historians who portray the unparalleled excellence of European civilization. Blaut shows how these historians deliberately distorted historical facts to promote Eurocentric views. They portray the non-Western world as backward and underdeveloped, while presenting Western progress as a factual reality. Blaut’s book proves that Western historians have suppressed and distorted the history and accomplishments of non-Western nations. This book makes it clear that Western claims of progress are based on a biased and prejudiced narrative, which arises from a fabricated history of the non-Western world.\n8. The Decline of Human Sciences\nThere are many invaluable fields of knowledge that reason and observation cannot access. Enlightenment scholars confined knowledge to the realm of the observable external world, and suffered from a grievous loss of understanding of the unobservables. The Quran emphasized belief in the unobservables, and indicates that rejection of unobservables would lead from light to darkness. The most important realm in which loss of knowledge occurred are the human sciences that relate to our inner states.\nBefore explaining this in detail, it is necessary to address a common misconception that has affected many Muslim thinkers. The two words \"reason\" and \"observation\" have a special meaning when used by secular thinkers, different from common everyday language. As mentioned earlier, secular observation is limited to the observation of the external world. Similarly, secular reason is restricted from going beyond this external observation. The famous Western philosopher Kant claimed that using reason beyond the bounds of observation is a grave error, and this is the dominant position in secular thought. In contrast, Islam teaches us that the best use of reason is to recognize Allah through the signs present in the universe and within our own selves. Secular knowledge considers this to be a misuse of reason.\nThe most valuable knowledge that secular sciences have rejected pertains to the inner world of humans. Imam Ghazali spent his life in search of knowledge. He mastered all the sciences of his time, and in the end, he attained the knowledge of the purification of the heart. He regarded this as the most valuable knowledge and also pointed out that it is not found in books. Contemporary Western intellectuals deny even the possibility of such knowledge, which is why there is no mention of it in Western education. This is a major reason why Islamic knowledge seems useless to those influenced by the West—this knowledge pertains to the inner world of the human, while Western thinkers deny the existence of the soul and consider the heart to be an enemy of reason.\nThe exclusion of the inner world of humans from secular knowledge happened gradually, and likewise, Western society gradually moved from light toward darkness in its understanding of human life. The first step was taken by Descartes, who is considered the founder of Western philosophy. He separated the inner world of humans from the external world, a concept known as dualism. His goal was to affirm that the external world is governed solely by material laws. This gave rise to a problem that Western thinkers have not been able to solve to this day: how does our inner world affect the external world? If every particle in the universe is governed by natural laws, is the human body, which is also material, bound by these laws too? Our life experience tells us that this is not the case. We can spring into motion from rest, and stop suddenly, purely due to an act of will. Acts of will are not predictable by mathematical formulae.\nWestern thinkers ignored this problem. In Kant's era, the concept of two worlds remained—one being the inner world of humans, where religion, morality, love, and emotions reside, and the other being the external world, which is governed only by mathematical laws. However, under the influence of increasing materialism, the idea emerged that our inner world has no separate existence, but is rather a part of the external world. Just as every particle in the material world is subject to Newton's laws, our thoughts and emotions are also created by fluids secreted by the brain, and these are also subject to natural laws. Thus, both the inner and external worlds of humans move according to mathematical laws. Just as Newton's laws are sufficient to understand the universe without the need for God, so too are natural laws sufficient to understand the inner world of humans without needing to ask anything from the Creator. In this way, the inner world of humans was entirely excluded from the realm of knowledge. While this descent into darkness has negatively affected all human sciences, we will briefly mention only two—psychology and economics.\nThe Enlightenment brought about astonishing changes in Western civilization. Previously, society was conceived of as a single body in which all its parts worked together toward a common purpose. The foundation of secular society, however, was built on the assumption that every individual is free to choose their own religion, and as a result, society no longer had any unified goals. With the emphasis on individualism, human connections weakened, and the feelings of love and responsibility that held society together gradually disappeared. Today, even the relationship between husband and wife, parents and children, has become temporary and limited. As a result of this individualism, various psychological disorders began to emerge, leading to the development of the science of psychology. However, this science was based on speculation because the rays of reason and observation cannot penetrate the depths of the human soul. One of the founders of psychology, Sigmund Freud, proposed absurd and morally reprehensible theories about these inner depths, theories that cannot even be mentioned in polite company. Since then, this darkness has only deepened, but this is not the appropriate place for the details.\nThe inner structure of the human being is known only to the Creator of humans, and we can only attain this knowledge through what He has revealed to us. In the past few decades, Muslims have begun to develop Islamic psychology based on our Islamic intellectual heritage. Significant progress has been made in this field, with many books and articles written, and courses, diplomas, and degrees now being offered in educational institutions. This knowledge describes the four dimensions of the human being: the nafs (lower self), which inclines toward evil, and the ruh (soul), which turns toward Allah; the qalb (heart), which in a purified state connects one to Allah; and the aql (intellect), which suggests strategies for achieving the goals proposed by the qalb, whether they are good or bad. The foundation of this Islamic knowledge lies partly in revelation and inspiration, and partly in the personal experiences of those individuals who have climbed the ladder of purification and spiritual growth. Since secular knowledge rejects both revelation and personal spiritual experiences, it cannot access Islamic psychological knowledge. Thus, we have a golden opportunity to excel in this uncontested field of knowledge.\nA society is a collection of individuals, and without proper knowledge of the inner structure of the human being, it is impossible to develop a true social science. The founders of the Enlightenment completely separated the inner sciences of humans from the external sciences, and their followers excluded the spiritual structure of humans from the realm of knowledge altogether. As a result, Western social sciences are built on entirely flawed foundations, and all of them need to be restructured from scratch.\nThe second science crucial to human life is economics. Current textbooks of economics argue that the purpose of every rational person’s life is to maximize pleasure by purchasing goods and services. This is an exact depiction of the nafs-e-ammara (the commanding self), and the Quran condemns it repeatedly. It is obvious that no sound knowledge can be built upon these false foundations. What is astonishing is that in universities all over the Islamic world, Muslim teachers are teaching this lesson of hedonism to Muslim students. In fact, Muslims have been dazzled by the glitter of Western knowledge and have failed to recognize the hidden poison of atheism within it. We need the vision of Iqbal:\n\"The brilliance of Western knowledge could not dazzle me;\nThe dust of Medina and Najaf is the collyrium of my eyes.\"\n9. The Hidden Assumptions of Western Secular Knowledge\nThe story of the birth and growth of Western secular knowledge is extremely complex and intricate. From an Islamic perspective, the details of this story are found in Syed Naquib al-Attas’s monumental book Islam and Secularism. Here, we will briefly outline only a few key points relevant to our purpose. The centuries-long religious wars devastated Europe, turning cities into ruins and destroying countless lives. This fostered intense hatred for religious beliefs among the thinkers of the Enlightenment and gave rise to a strong desire to seek truth through reason and experience, instead of the Bible. The personal losses and widespread chaos they witnessed made them search for a new path for humanity—one free from the fear of religious disputes. In this search, Newton's spectacular discoveries, celebrated across Europe, were extremely influential.\nNewton demonstrated that his laws of gravitation explained countless phenomena, from the motion of the planets to the waves of the seas. He claimed that these laws applied to everything, from the smallest particles to the largest planets. This led to a special mindset among European thinkers: that every particle in the universe is subject to laws that determine its entire motion, from the beginning of the universe to its end. This led to the view of God as a clockmaker, who created an extremely complex mechanism, set it into motion, and then let it operate on its own. From this, the concept emerged that knowledge is, in fact, based on understanding the laws that govern the world, rendering God unnecessary. The famous mathematician Laplace, who wrote a book on the movement of the stars, was asked why he did not mention God, the Creator of the stars, in his book. He replied that he had no need for that hypothesis. Just as the laws of nature excluded God from the universe, these same laws also excluded humanity. When every particle is bound by such laws that even God cannot intervene, how can the human soul, with its desires and thoughts, have any effect? The soul was removed from the concept of humanity, and man was reduced to a mere material machine, a robot that operates according to mathematical laws.\nThere are many flaws in these ideas and several hidden assumptions that are incorrect. Here, we will briefly mention a few key points:\nWhat guarantee do we have that the laws of nature we have observed will continue to function in the future? Just as a clock runs for a long time in a certain way but eventually stops, it is possible that the laws we observe today may change tomorrow. In fact, Imam Ghazali explained to us a thousand years ago that the universe has no power to sustain itself for even a single moment. Allah recreates the universe moment by moment, which is why it continues to exist. If there are any laws of nature, they are created by Allah. The order and discipline we observe in this universe are, in fact, evidence of Allah’s existence.\nNewton’s astonishing successes gave the thinkers of the Enlightenment confidence that they could reach universal truths based solely on reason and observation, and that this was the only path to truth. However, later scientific and philosophical developments shattered this hope. It became clear that the laws derived from specific observations could not be applied outside of that specific context. The current validity of laws does not guarantee that they will remain valid in the future. From a scientific perspective, many of Newton’s theories were proven wrong. In particular, his laws do not apply to very small particles or at very high speeds. There are many other exceptions as well. Notably, human free will itself provides a strong exception. Humans are autonomous in their actions and are not bound by any mathematical law. The concept of reward and punishment in this world and the hereafter is based on good and evil, as well as human choice. In secular sciences, the concepts of good, evil, and human choice are highly confused because, in a mechanical world governed by laws, there is no room for such concepts.\n10. The Toxic Foundations of Western Social Sciences\nSecular knowledge has limited reason and observation to the external world, but most Muslims have failed to understand these restrictions. The majority of Muslim thinkers believe that since the Quran encourages the use of reason and observation to acquire knowledge, there is no fundamental difference between the methods of acquiring knowledge in Islamic teachings and Western sciences. However, the early verses of the Quran describe the characteristics of the righteous as those who believe in the unseen. The fundamental principle of secular thinking, however, is the denial of the unseen. This denial leads to a rejection of God, the Day of Judgment, and the concept of accountability in the hereafter, as well as the secular claim that this rejection is required by reason. The truth is that denying the unseen is itself irrational. The result of this denial is the claim that the universe came into existence on its own, because its Creator must necessarily be outside the bounds of the universe, and our observation cannot go beyond the universe. Despite being against reason, secular thinkers still claim that the universe came into existence on its own. Gradually, inanimate objects came together and became living beings, and through the process of evolution, humans emerged. The central characteristic of this process of evolution is a brutal competition: either we tear others apart and devour them, or they will tear us apart. The law of the jungle is the only law that applies—the right to live belongs solely to the powerful. Obviously, such a concept may be suitable for life in the wilderness but not for building a human society.\nToday, the destructive effects of these toxic ideas are in plain sight. There is an unending series of wars, in which countless innocent lives are deliberately sacrificed to gain power and profit. The leader of the so-called \"civilized\" world, America, which claims to be the most advanced civilization in humanity, manufactures and exports ten times more weapons than the rest of the world. It is said that wars are merely a way to increase arms sales. Statistics show that there is much truth in this claim. The entire world has been devastated by the idea that everything is permissible in the pursuit of power, wealth, and luxury. Millions of land and sea creatures are slaughtered. These wars have caused so much environmental damage that the future of human life on Earth is in jeopardy. Western social sciences have not only brought death and destruction across the globe but have also destroyed the family—the basic unit of human society—in the West itself. More than fifty percent of children in the West are born to unmarried mothers. Children deprived of the love and security of a home with both parents, never learn to love others selflessly throughout their lives.\nOut of ignorance and inferiority complexes, Muslims have equated Western social sciences with Western scientific knowledge, and they remain engaged in the futile exercise of trying to sift out the correct ideas and discard the wrong ones. However, Western secular knowledge is like the Dajjal—it has a sharp eye for the external world but is blind to the inner world of the human being. An Islamic society cannot be built on the concept that humans are merely animals. One of the major causes of the corruption in our Islamic societies is that we are trying to run our societies according to Western principles. Our systems of governance are based on Western parliamentary democracy rather than the Islamic system of the caliphate and shura (consultation). Our courts enforce Western laws and apply Western principles to Muslim societies. Our economies are operating according to the principles laid out by the Jews. Numerous un-Islamic influences have permeated our society. Today's Islamic society reflects the hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) foretold that this Ummah would follow in the footsteps of the Jews and Christians, even if they were to enter a lizard's hole. The root of all these problems is the educational system, which teaches our generations to revere the West and Western knowledge. As long as this system continues to poison the minds of millions of Muslim youth, no proposal for the revival of the Ummah will be effective.\n11. The Failed Attempts to Combine Western and Islamic Sciences\nMost Muslims agree that the current educational system, which completely neglects Islamic intellectual heritage, is not suitable for Islamic societies. Consequently, numerous Islamic educational institutions are being established throughout the Islamic world. The common approach of these institutions is to teach Islamic sciences alongside Western sciences. Can these institutions solve our problem? In our view, the answer is no. The reasons for this are detailed below.\nCurrently, the entire world operates under the capitalist system. All parts of this system—politics, law, society, economy, and education—are interconnected. The role of the educational system is to instill in students a desire for wealth and a luxurious life, and to help them obtain high-paying jobs to fulfill this desire. These jobs make students part of the capitalist system. If we teach students through Islamic education that Islam provides us with the best system, which encompasses all aspects of life, but then prepare the same students to become part of the capitalist system and strengthen this un-Islamic system, our Islamic education becomes mere rhetoric. On the one hand, we claim the superiority of Islamic knowledge, yet on the other hand, we train our students to rely on a non-Islamic system for their livelihood.\nAs mentioned earlier in this essay, fifty years ago, the thinkers of the Islamization of knowledge movement recognized the central role of an Islamic educational system in the revival of Islam. As a result of their efforts, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) established two Islamic universities where Islamic sciences and contemporary sciences are taught together. However, these universities have also failed to chart a new intellectual course for the Islamic world. The primary reason is that both universities prepare students for jobs within the capitalist system. The students themselves understand this, which is why they are not particularly interested in the Islamic subjects—they neither help them secure jobs nor enable them to acquire more valuable worldly knowledge. Besides these universities, some individuals have, with lofty ambitions, attempted to establish institutions that offer a complete Islamic educational system, where spiritual training, character-building, and worldly knowledge are all taught. Yet, no successful model has emerged, and even if one were to be developed, it would not solve our problems. As long as the thousands of existing institutions continue teaching our youth the principles of Western society and the superiority of those principles, the formation of an Islamic society will remain impossible.\n12. Proposed Plan of Action\nSo, given the failure of many attempts, how can we create a viable path to progress? The first thing to understand is that secular knowledge is itself a religion. It teaches students how to live and what the purpose of life is. The current economics textbooks openly state that the goal of our lives is to maximize pleasure. Just as Christianity or Buddhism cannot be Islamized, secular social sciences cannot be molded into an Islamic form. The hidden beliefs embedded within these sciences must be exposed and refuted. We cannot achieve this by creating separate institutions or by teaching an additional subject like Islamic economics. We need to teach the same subject, such as Western economics, but in a different way. We should explain that Western nations believe that the foundation of economics is selfishness, hedonism, competition, and individualism. In contrast, Islam teaches us values like generosity, simple living, cooperation, and community. We need to change the objectives and methods of education within the existing institutions. Having spent my entire life in these Western educational institutions, first as a student and then as a teacher, my experience tells me that while this task is difficult, it can be done. However, a natural question arises here: after teaching all this philosophy, won’t our students still be forced to seek jobs in the capitalist system? And if that happens, won’t all this philosophy become meaningless?\nTo answer this question, it is important to understand that a significant portion of Western education is dedicated to brainwashing. In this segment, students are taught how to think about the world and themselves. Students are taught that the purpose of education is to get a job, and that they are not human beings but \"human resources\"—raw material to be sold in the marketplace. We can openly refute these ideas. We should teach our students that humans are the most valuable creation of Allah. Our lives cannot be measured in money, and we are not commodities to be bought and sold in the marketplace as human resources. We should encourage our students to make the intention that they will use their education to serve the Ummah, not for personal gain. If we shape their minds in an Islamic manner, this will not hinder them from finding jobs. However, their purpose in seeking jobs will change. Rather than pursuing personal luxury, they will be working to fulfill their responsibilities. Moreover, we can teach students agriculture and trade, which will make them self-sufficient and free from the need to seek jobs. Teaching is also an excellent field, providing ample opportunities for Islamic mental development in students. In short, if we do everything that is possible in the current world, Allah will open the way for further progress.\nIn reality, we do not need to Islamize Western knowledge—we already possess far superior knowledge. We need to Islamize our education system, which currently mimics the West and promotes many secular ideas that conflict with Islam. The most important goal of Islamic educational institutions should be character development—a domain completely absent from Western education. It is not only necessary to incorporate this into our current educational system, but it must also be given a central role in education. How this can be done is a separate and lengthy discussion, which we will leave for another time. Moreover, specific strategies are needed to Islamicize each field of education. For example, medical students should be taught that saving a life is equivalent to saving all of humanity, as stated by Allah. We should work with the intention to earn this reward. Similarly, in engineering and other technical and scientific fields, for the time being, the content can remain Western, but the intention will be to serve humanity and to recognize the signs (ayat) of Allah in the external world. However, the approach must be very different for the social sciences.\nWestern social sciences are the lessons that the West learned from its religious wars. These lessons teach us how to build a secular society in which religion plays no role. We must completely reject these lessons and insist that we will build an Islamic society based solely on Islamic foundations. Once this goal is clear, we have an abundance of resources to accomplish it. Our entire body of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) teaches us how to build an Islamic society. Additionally, we have the example of a thousand years of dominance of the Islamic civilization, from which thousands of practical models for modern times can be drawn. A great deal of work has already been done in this area, which can serve as a foundation for further progress. Forming a society according to Islamic principles is our religious obligation. If we take up this challenge and dedicate ourselves to it, Allah will help us in ways we cannot imagine.\n\"If you are loyal to Muhammad (peace be upon him), then we belong to you.\nWhat is this world? Even the tablet and the pen are yours.\"\nAt the end of this essay, we pray to Allah to illuminate our hearts with the light of faith, make it easy for us to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and guide the Ummah out of its current darkness into the light of His recognition.\n\nidentify 5 pros and 5 cons from the perspective of a worldbank consultant and find ways to improve the argument:\nThe Revival of Islam: The Central Role of Islamic Educational System\nAsad Zaman\n \nIntroduction\nAllah's final message lifted the Arabs from the depths of degradation and led them to world leadership. Through this knowledge, they laid the foundation of a civilization whose light illuminated the world for nearly a thousand years. These glorious tales of our brilliant past are in dramatic contrast with our current conditions. Today, the world has become a slaughterhouse for millions of Muslims, while we are helpless spectators. What is the cause of this severe decline? For the past century, thinkers have been offering various diagnoses for our disease, and corresponding solutions. Many different remedies have been proposed, ranging from the propagation of Islam, implementation of Shariah, emphasis on Jihad, or the restoration of the Caliphate. Despite all these efforts, the condition of the Ummah has gone from bad to worse.\nThe real cause of our current decline is an extraordinary event unparalleled in the history of Muslims. In the 19th century, the Western powers established dominance over approximately 85% of the world's nations, and the same proportion of Muslim countries also came under their rule. For such extensive control, armies alone were not sufficient; it was also necessary the minds of the masses, so that millions of people would not even entertain the thought of rebellion against a handful of rulers. In creating this slavish mentality, the educational system played a central role.\nLord Macaulay abolished the traditional educational systems of India and introduced an alternative Western educational system with the explicit purpose of creating respect and admiration for the West while promoting contempt and hatred for local traditions. Through this education, a class emerged that helped the British plunder their own nation. Today, Western dominance over the world has ended, but this pro-Western class still holds power over Islamic countries. The Western educational system is crucial element of the soft power required for this minority to rule the masses. As a result, this educational system is still in place in all Islamic countries today. As long as this system continues to instill in our youth a sense of reverence for the West and disdain for their own culture and religious traditions, the revival of Islam will remain a distant dream.\nTo change the future of Islamic societies, we must transform our educational system. At present, throughout the Islamic world, our youth are trapped in the grips of Western education— an education that sings the praises of the West and erases all the achievements of Islamic civilization from the pages of history. Through this education, our youth learn that Western knowledge is superior to all other forms of knowledge and that Western civilization is the most advanced and magnificent civilization in human history. This notion is entirely contrary to Islamic teachings, which tell us that the knowledge of the Quran is superior to all other knowledge and that the most advanced and developed society was the one that emerged from the teachings of our Prophet (peace be upon him) fourteen centuries ago.\nAmong those working for the revival of Islam, only one group has recognized the central role of education. These thinkers have attempted to remove the pro-Western elements from Western knowledge and shape it within an Islamic framework. However, despite fifty years of effort, this Islamization of Knowledge project has not been successful. In this essay, we will examine the reasons for this failure and propose an alternative strategy through which current educational institutions can not only foster an Islamic mindset in our youth and protect them from Westernization but also allow them to benefit from modern education.\n2. Sources and Impacts of Secular Knowledge\nThe belief that knowledge is universal and transcends geographical boundaries turns the term \"secular knowledge\" into a misconception. However, studying the evolution of knowledge helps clear this misconception. In the 16th century, Europeans considered the Bible to be the ultimate truth. By the 18th century, religious knowledge had become a private matter, and only those ideas that could be empirically proven were accepted as common and public knowledge. This transformation led to the creation of what we now call secular knowledge.\nSecular knowledge claims to be based on facts and logic, equally acceptable to all religions. Western civilization asserts that it is superior to all other civilizations because it has created this unique form of knowledge, which is superior to all types of knowledge ever produced by humanity. Muslims, by and large, have accepted this claim that secular knowledge is based solely on facts and logic, and is equally acceptable to all rational and truth-seeking individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs. For this reason, the spread of Western education in the Islamic world was not met with much opposition. In fact, a large section of Muslims considers this education to be the path to salvation and believes that the absence of this education is the reason for the current decline of Muslims. The first objective of this essay is to make it clear that the claim of secular knowledge is false. In reality, the foundation of secular knowledge is the denial of religion. This poisonous element hidden in Western education was recognized by our elders, and that is why the scholars of the Islamic madrasas have avoided this knowledge to this day. As Allama Iqbal wrote (translated):\n\"We thought education would bring peace; who knew that atheism would come along with it?\"\nThese Western sciences claim superiority over Quranic knowledge and are misleading our Muslim youth in various ways. Our Quran too claims its superiority and challenges others to produce even a single verse comparable to it. We must step into the intellectual arena, reject the deceptive claims of Western education, and prove the far greater superiority of Quranic knowledge. This is the subject of our essay: how can we achieve this goal?\n3. Eurocentric History: The Enlightenment\nThe foundations of Western education are based on the following concepts regarding human history:\nThe Enlightenment movement began in Europe in the 17th Century, and led to an astonishing expansion in humanity's collective knowledge. The sun of reason rose upon the West, and in its light, the people of the West realized that all of humanity had been shackled by the chains of superstitions, passed down from generation to generation. Traditional humans lacked the courage to think independently, neither producing new ideas nor questioning old errors. Enlightenment intellectuals decided that from now on, all knowledge, whether religious or worldly, must be tested on the criterion of reason. Consequently, the knowledge that proved to be true in the light of reason and observation would be accepted, while the rest would be rejected. In this way, they rebuilt all of human knowledge on the foundations of reason and observation. From this perspective, it appears that all the knowledge of the modern era has been created by the people of the West. Since this Western conception of knowledge clashes with Islamic beliefs, we will refer to it as \"secular knowledge\" in this essay.\nThe people of the West claim that these secular sciences are unparalleled in the entire history of humanity. It is through these sciences that they have conquered the world, inventing a variety of astonishing devices that continue to impact human life moment by moment. Because of their spectacular innovations in all fields of knowledge, they have achieved the status of the most advanced civilization in the world. Today, if any nation wants to progress, it must acquire these Western sciences. Progress itself means adopting the sciences and societal norms of the West.\n4. The Dominance of the Western Narrative\nThe story of the Enlightenment is deeply embedded in every aspect of the Western educational system. Every student who receives modern education spends many years studying only the sciences developed by the West, with no mention of Islamic teachings. Such education reinforces the Western narrative that only Western knowledge can meet the needs of the modern world, while Islamic knowledge has become completely irrelevant in contemporary times.\nIt is obvious that this claim by the West directly conflicts with fundamental Islamic teachings. It was the knowledge given by Allah that pulled humanity out of the darkness of ignorance and superstition. The light of this knowledge illuminated the entire world for a thousand years. This knowledge is sufficient to guide us until the Day of Judgment. Even today, we have no need to ask for guidance from foreign nations. While we maintain this belief based on faith, we are unable to provide the evidence required to support it. The overwhelming majority of the Ummah spends their lives in pursuit of these Western sciences. Very few people study Islamic knowledge, and even those who do are not able to apply it to solve modern problems. In this way, the actions of the Ummah also become a testimony to the superiority of Western knowledge.\nThere is an African proverb that: \"Until the lions have their own historians, the tales of the hunt will always glorify the hunters.\"  We must re-examine European history from an Islamic perspective and consider whether this is a story of progress and advancement, or the story of decline and degeneration. The claim of Western superiority over all nations resembles the claim of the people of 'Aad: \"Who is mightier than us in strength?\" From an Islamic perspective, a critical examination of Western history can expose the falsehood of such claims.\n5. Secular Knowledge: Born out of Devastating Religious Wars\nTo understand secular knowledge, it is essential to understand the historical background in which this knowledge was born. The period from the 4th to the 14th century AD is known as the \"Dark Ages\" of Europe, during which knowledge in Europe was almost nonexistent. At the same time, the message of Islam ignited a thirst for knowledge among Muslims. They gathered knowledge from all over the world and made remarkable progress in every field of learning. Ibn Khaldun, in his study of history, mentions an ancient principle: when nations reach their peak, they fall into luxury and indulgence. This very indulgence becomes the prelude to their downfall, leading neighboring barbarian tribes to attack and loot their treasures. Similarly, when the seven-century-old civilization of Al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) fell into the grip of luxury and indulgence in its later years, neighboring Christian tribes eventually recaptured Spain. With this conquest, millions of books from Andalusian libraries fell into their hands. The unique teachings of the Quran had made Muslims passionate about knowledge, and the vast intellectual treasures they had accumulated from around the world were what ended the dark ages of the West and lit the lamp of knowledge in Europe.\nThe Catholic Church maintained its grip on Europe for a thousand years by keeping the masses ignorant and confining knowledge within the walls of the Church. The flood of knowledge posed a great threat to the Church because it contradicted its teachings. The Church made every effort to suppress this knowledge, imposing strict restrictions on translations. No book could be published without the Church's permission and seal. Under the Church's authority, a terrifying institution called the Inquisition was established. This institution was created to stop the spread of ideas that were contrary to the Church's accepted doctrines. Anyone who expressed or wrote such ideas faced severe punishments, torture, and imprisonment.\nThe Church's efforts to dam the flood of knowledge led to divisions within the Church itself. The Protestant faction rejected the authority of the Catholic Church, and its centuries-old traditions, in order to create space for new forms of knowledge. Following this split, a series of extremely bloody and destructive wars erupted between these two factions, which continued for centuries. The growth of secular knowledge in Europe was profoundly shaped by the devastating impact of these religious wars. This violence forced many prominent Western thinkers to flee, while others lived under the constant threat of the Church's inquisition.\nBecause of these centuries of religious wars and the bitter personal experiences they endured, the founders of the Enlightenment concluded that society could not be built on religious foundations. They insisted that the social sciences must be based solely on reason and observation, so that everyone could agree upon them. It was not that, suddenly in the 17th century, the sun of reason rose from Europe for the first time; rather, the Enlightenment was an intellectual search for the foundations of a peaceful society. As we will see later in this essay, this search did not succeed. Due to several fundamental mistakes made by the Enlightenment thinkers, the cycle of destructive wars not only continued but intensified. Even today, the world is still searching for that peaceful society, the method for which was taught to us fourteen centuries ago. Unfortunately, Muslims have been removed from the position of global leadership and are unable to present a model for a peaceful society. This essay has been written to investigate the reasons for this tragedy and to search for its solution.\nFor nearly two centuries, the champions of the Enlightenment engaged in a struggle against the scholastic school of thought, who wanted to build society on religious foundations. In this intellectual battle, the Enlightenment ultimately emerged victorious, and the scholastics were defeated. Over the past two to three centuries, all secular Western sciences have been developed on the principles of the Enlightenment. However, since the Enlightenment itself was founded on mistaken assumptions, these faulty assumptions have permeated all secular sciences. Western education teaches our students to believe in these incorrect assumptions, which conflict with Islamic teachings. This is why it is now imperative for the future of the Ummah to develop an Islamic educational system as an alternative to Western education.\n6. The Incorrect Assumptions of the Enlightenment\nA long list can be made of the incorrect assumptions of the Enlightenment. European intellectuals believed that religious differences were the root cause of ongoing civil wars. They thought that if knowledge were confined to reason and observation, these differences would disappear, and a peaceful society would emerge. Moreover, because this knowledge would be based on reason and observation, it would be absolutely true, free from any errors, and universally accepted by all rational individuals. Some of the fundamental flaws in these assumptions are outlined below:\n1. The religious wars in the West were not actually fought over religion but for power, wealth, and dominance. The greatest proof of this is that even after the ideas of the Enlightenment gained widespread acceptance and societies were established on secular foundations, wars did not decrease; rather, they increased.\n2. The idea that all human knowledge can be restructured purely on the basis of reason and observation is incorrect. There are many fields of knowledge where reason and observation cannot reach. In these fields, instead of progress, secular knowledge in the West experienced decline. This will be discussed in more detail later.\n3. It is also a misconception that “absolute truth” can be attained solely through reason and observation. A thousand years ago, Imam Ghazali had already reached the conclusion in his famous treatise Al-Munqidh min ad-Dalal. He showed arrive at any knowledge through reason and observation, certain metaphysical assumptions must first be accepted, and these assumptions lie beyond reason and observation. Secular thinkers continue to claim that their knowledge is universally accepted and absolutely true, even though this claim can easily be disproven. Moreover, a web of propaganda has been woven, which keeps these assumptions hidden from view. Because of this, even religious people accept this knowledge, unaware of the concealed atheistic foundations.\n4. Since the goal of the Enlightenment thinkers was to create knowledge that everyone could agree upon, they confined observation to the external world only. If a person observes their inner state, the knowledge obtained from such observation has no place in secular knowledge because this inner experience cannot be definitively known to anyone else. As a result, knowledge was divided into two parts. Secular thinkers allowed every individual the freedom to think whatever they want about their inner world and to believe in any ideology or religion they wished. However, knowledge about the external world must conform to secular principles. Thus, Christianity became limited to a personal belief system, and society was structured on secular foundations. Secular thinkers excluded spiritual knowledge from the realm of knowledge.\nThe current Western education system is based on secular epistemology built on these flawed foundations. Without correcting these four errors, we cannot create an Islamic alternative to Western education. How can this be done? The next four sections of this essay will explain these four misconceptions in detail, in corresponding sequence. By correcting these mistakes, we can develop an Islamic educational system that will surpass any educational system currently available in the world. Such a system will also serve as a clear demonstration of the superiority of Islamic knowledge.\n7. The Need for an Islamic Analysis of History\nIt is said that history is merely the conquest song of the victors. When reading most Western historical books, it seems as though the world was shrouded in darkness before the rise of the West. Apart from the ancient Greeks, (also considered as Europeans), no other nation had accomplished anything of note before the Enlightenment of Europe. Since their rise in the 17th century, Western nations have made astonishing progress in every field of knowledge and action, unprecedented in human history. Europeans reached the moon and are now reaching for the stars, leaving all others behind in the dust. Even if not explicitly stated, such ideas underlie much of Western education. Naturally, if a student learns such lessons, it becomes difficult for them to believe in Islam’s fundamental tenets—especially the belief that the knowledge given by Allah surpasses all human knowledge, just as Allah Himself surpasses all of His creation. It also challenges the belief that the time of our Prophet was the best of times, and the society formed under his leadership was the best society.\nToday’s Western thinkers regard the past three centuries as the period of greatest progress in human history and attribute their advancement to the rejection of religious traditions and the insistence on reason. The Quran, however, tells us that those who deny God will be deprived of the light of true knowledge and will be driven into darkness. To affirm this Quranic narrative, we must reject the West-centric histories and create an alternative narrative. Seventy years ago, Syed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi laid the foundation for such a narrative in his renowned book Maza Khasira al-‘Alam bi Inhitat al-Muslimeen (What the World Lost Due to the Decline of Muslims). However, there has not been sufficient progress based on this foundation, and there is a pressing need for further development.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the West had control over approximately 85% of the world. But after the massive bloodshed of World War I and World War II, Western powers were weakened, and most of the countries under their control gained independence. As the West’s dominance waned, many books began to emerge that strongly refuted the pro-Western historical narratives. A few important books in this regard, which should be included in educational curricula, are listed below. Translating these books and incorporating them into the curricula of Islamic educational institutions would be a significant step forward in the process of Islamizing knowledge.\n1. Edward Said, in his famous book Orientalism, examines how the West has portrayed the Islamic world in a highly negative light. All virtues were attributed to the West, while all vices were associated with the East. This sense of superiority permeates Western intellectual and literary productions such as dramas, novels, history, and the social sciences. Said argues that these concepts have no connection to reality; rather, they are the result of the West’s global dominance over the East, which gave rise to a sense of superiority in the West. Through this analysis, Said demonstrates how these perceptions maintain a system of power and oppression that benefits the West and weakens the East by instilling a sense of inferiority and dependence.\n2. Stavrianos, in his book Global Rift, writes that many pro-Western historical accounts chronicle the West’s remarkable rise and attribute its success to the West’s creativity, intelligence, scientific achievements, honesty, integrity, hard work, and respect for legal rights. Conversely, the poverty and backwardness of the East are explained by the absence of these noble qualities. This narrative is far from the truth. Stavrianos explains that the West engaged in colonial exploitation in the East, looting its resources and wealth. According to a recent research paper, during British colonial rule, Britain looted approximately 45 trillion US dollars worth of wealth from India. This large-scale plundering was the cause of the West’s prosperity and the East’s poverty.\nThe Causes of Western Global Dominance:\nStavrianos’s analysis raises a natural question: If the West is not superior to the rest of the world, how did it manage to defeat all other nations? One answer was given a thousand years ago by Ibn Khaldun, who explained that barbaric tribes often overcome developed but declining civilizations. Genghis Khan did not defeat the Muslims because of his virtuous character but due to his extreme savagery and brutality. Another answer is that after centuries of extremely bloody wars among themselves, Western nations became highly skilled in the art of warfare. Additionally, secular knowledge freed them from the moral values of their religion. Secular thinkers believed that humans are a type of animal, and the law of evolution dictates that the strong should tear apart and consume the weak. According to secular political thinkers, every means and trick to gain power is justified, even if it involves committing the greatest of wrongs, such as swearing false oaths, killing millions of innocent people, enslaving millions by force, or making profits by selling harmful and addictive substances. The phrase \"All is fair in love and war\" is their invention, meaning that no moral barriers should stand in the way of acquiring pleasure or wealth. This freedom from moral constraints greatly helped them conquer the world.\n3. Theft of History: In his book Theft of History, Jack Goody explains how the West has stolen the accomplishments of other civilizations and claimed them as its own. This is why Western historical accounts only seem to highlight their successes. On this subject, Chandrakant Raju’s book Is Science Western in Origin? is eye-opening. Due to the Crusades, enmity and hatred toward Muslims had taken root in the hearts of Europe’s Christians. They acquired knowledge on a large scale from Muslim books but attributed these ideas either to the Greeks or to Western plagiarists. This is why Western thinkers' progress appears so astounding—they stamped their name on six centuries of Muslim progress. Raju provides several examples of plagiarists, such as Copernicus. Copernicus is still regarded as a revolutionary thinker, even though he merely translated the astronomical work of Ibn al-Shatir. He could not acknowledge this due to the severe punishments imposed by the Church for presenting the ideas of Muslims.\n4. Unmasking Eurocentric Historians: James M. Blaut’s book Eight Eurocentric Historians exposes the bias and prejudice in the historical narratives of Western historians. This book analyzes the thoughts of eight historians who portray the unparalleled excellence of European civilization. Blaut shows how these historians deliberately distorted historical facts to promote Eurocentric views. They portray the non-Western world as backward and underdeveloped, while presenting Western progress as a factual reality. Blaut’s book proves that Western historians have suppressed and distorted the history and accomplishments of non-Western nations. This book makes it clear that Western claims of progress are based on a biased and prejudiced narrative, which arises from a fabricated history of the non-Western world.\n8. The Decline of Human Sciences\nThere are many invaluable fields of knowledge that reason and observation cannot access. Enlightenment scholars confined knowledge to the realm of the observable external world, and suffered from a grievous loss of understanding of the unobservables. The Quran emphasized belief in the unobservables, and indicates that rejection of unobservables would lead from light to darkness. The most important realm in which loss of knowledge occurred are the human sciences that relate to our inner states.\nBefore explaining this in detail, it is necessary to address a common misconception that has affected many Muslim thinkers. The two words \"reason\" and \"observation\" have a special meaning when used by secular thinkers, different from common everyday language. As mentioned earlier, secular observation is limited to the observation of the external world. Similarly, secular reason is restricted from going beyond this external observation. The famous Western philosopher Kant claimed that using reason beyond the bounds of observation is a grave error, and this is the dominant position in secular thought. In contrast, Islam teaches us that the best use of reason is to recognize Allah through the signs present in the universe and within our own selves. Secular knowledge considers this to be a misuse of reason.\nThe most valuable knowledge that secular sciences have rejected pertains to the inner world of humans. Imam Ghazali spent his life in search of knowledge. He mastered all the sciences of his time, and in the end, he attained the knowledge of the purification of the heart. He regarded this as the most valuable knowledge and also pointed out that it is not found in books. Contemporary Western intellectuals deny even the possibility of such knowledge, which is why there is no mention of it in Western education. This is a major reason why Islamic knowledge seems useless to those influenced by the West—this knowledge pertains to the inner world of the human, while Western thinkers deny the existence of the soul and consider the heart to be an enemy of reason.\nThe exclusion of the inner world of humans from secular knowledge happened gradually, and likewise, Western society gradually moved from light toward darkness in its understanding of human life. The first step was taken by Descartes, who is considered the founder of Western philosophy. He separated the inner world of humans from the external world, a concept known as dualism. His goal was to affirm that the external world is governed solely by material laws. This gave rise to a problem that Western thinkers have not been able to solve to this day: how does our inner world affect the external world? If every particle in the universe is governed by natural laws, is the human body, which is also material, bound by these laws too? Our life experience tells us that this is not the case. We can spring into motion from rest, and stop suddenly, purely due to an act of will. Acts of will are not predictable by mathematical formulae.\nWestern thinkers ignored this problem. In Kant's era, the concept of two worlds remained—one being the inner world of humans, where religion, morality, love, and emotions reside, and the other being the external world, which is governed only by mathematical laws. However, under the influence of increasing materialism, the idea emerged that our inner world has no separate existence, but is rather a part of the external world. Just as every particle in the material world is subject to Newton's laws, our thoughts and emotions are also created by fluids secreted by the brain, and these are also subject to natural laws. Thus, both the inner and external worlds of humans move according to mathematical laws. Just as Newton's laws are sufficient to understand the universe without the need for God, so too are natural laws sufficient to understand the inner world of humans without needing to ask anything from the Creator. In this way, the inner world of humans was entirely excluded from the realm of knowledge. While this descent into darkness has negatively affected all human sciences, we will briefly mention only two—psychology and economics.\nThe Enlightenment brought about astonishing changes in Western civilization. Previously, society was conceived of as a single body in which all its parts worked together toward a common purpose. The foundation of secular society, however, was built on the assumption that every individual is free to choose their own religion, and as a result, society no longer had any unified goals. With the emphasis on individualism, human connections weakened, and the feelings of love and responsibility that held society together gradually disappeared. Today, even the relationship between husband and wife, parents and children, has become temporary and limited. As a result of this individualism, various psychological disorders began to emerge, leading to the development of the science of psychology. However, this science was based on speculation because the rays of reason and observation cannot penetrate the depths of the human soul. One of the founders of psychology, Sigmund Freud, proposed absurd and morally reprehensible theories about these inner depths, theories that cannot even be mentioned in polite company. Since then, this darkness has only deepened, but this is not the appropriate place for the details.\nThe inner structure of the human being is known only to the Creator of humans, and we can only attain this knowledge through what He has revealed to us. In the past few decades, Muslims have begun to develop Islamic psychology based on our Islamic intellectual heritage. Significant progress has been made in this field, with many books and articles written, and courses, diplomas, and degrees now being offered in educational institutions. This knowledge describes the four dimensions of the human being: the nafs (lower self), which inclines toward evil, and the ruh (soul), which turns toward Allah; the qalb (heart), which in a purified state connects one to Allah; and the aql (intellect), which suggests strategies for achieving the goals proposed by the qalb, whether they are good or bad. The foundation of this Islamic knowledge lies partly in revelation and inspiration, and partly in the personal experiences of those individuals who have climbed the ladder of purification and spiritual growth. Since secular knowledge rejects both revelation and personal spiritual experiences, it cannot access Islamic psychological knowledge. Thus, we have a golden opportunity to excel in this uncontested field of knowledge.\nA society is a collection of individuals, and without proper knowledge of the inner structure of the human being, it is impossible to develop a true social science. The founders of the Enlightenment completely separated the inner sciences of humans from the external sciences, and their followers excluded the spiritual structure of humans from the realm of knowledge altogether. As a result, Western social sciences are built on entirely flawed foundations, and all of them need to be restructured from scratch.\nThe second science crucial to human life is economics. Current textbooks of economics argue that the purpose of every rational person’s life is to maximize pleasure by purchasing goods and services. This is an exact depiction of the nafs-e-ammara (the commanding self), and the Quran condemns it repeatedly. It is obvious that no sound knowledge can be built upon these false foundations. What is astonishing is that in universities all over the Islamic world, Muslim teachers are teaching this lesson of hedonism to Muslim students. In fact, Muslims have been dazzled by the glitter of Western knowledge and have failed to recognize the hidden poison of atheism within it. We need the vision of Iqbal:\n\"The brilliance of Western knowledge could not dazzle me;\nThe dust of Medina and Najaf is the collyrium of my eyes.\"\n9. The Hidden Assumptions of Western Secular Knowledge\nThe story of the birth and growth of Western secular knowledge is extremely complex and intricate. From an Islamic perspective, the details of this story are found in Syed Naquib al-Attas’s monumental book Islam and Secularism. Here, we will briefly outline only a few key points relevant to our purpose. The centuries-long religious wars devastated Europe, turning cities into ruins and destroying countless lives. This fostered intense hatred for religious beliefs among the thinkers of the Enlightenment and gave rise to a strong desire to seek truth through reason and experience, instead of the Bible. The personal losses and widespread chaos they witnessed made them search for a new path for humanity—one free from the fear of religious disputes. In this search, Newton's spectacular discoveries, celebrated across Europe, were extremely influential.\nNewton demonstrated that his laws of gravitation explained countless phenomena, from the motion of the planets to the waves of the seas. He claimed that these laws applied to everything, from the smallest particles to the largest planets. This led to a special mindset among European thinkers: that every particle in the universe is subject to laws that determine its entire motion, from the beginning of the universe to its end. This led to the view of God as a clockmaker, who created an extremely complex mechanism, set it into motion, and then let it operate on its own. From this, the concept emerged that knowledge is, in fact, based on understanding the laws that govern the world, rendering God unnecessary. The famous mathematician Laplace, who wrote a book on the movement of the stars, was asked why he did not mention God, the Creator of the stars, in his book. He replied that he had no need for that hypothesis. Just as the laws of nature excluded God from the universe, these same laws also excluded humanity. When every particle is bound by such laws that even God cannot intervene, how can the human soul, with its desires and thoughts, have any effect? The soul was removed from the concept of humanity, and man was reduced to a mere material machine, a robot that operates according to mathematical laws.\nThere are many flaws in these ideas and several hidden assumptions that are incorrect. Here, we will briefly mention a few key points:\nWhat guarantee do we have that the laws of nature we have observed will continue to function in the future? Just as a clock runs for a long time in a certain way but eventually stops, it is possible that the laws we observe today may change tomorrow. In fact, Imam Ghazali explained to us a thousand years ago that the universe has no power to sustain itself for even a single moment. Allah recreates the universe moment by moment, which is why it continues to exist. If there are any laws of nature, they are created by Allah. The order and discipline we observe in this universe are, in fact, evidence of Allah’s existence.\nNewton’s astonishing successes gave the thinkers of the Enlightenment confidence that they could reach universal truths based solely on reason and observation, and that this was the only path to truth. However, later scientific and philosophical developments shattered this hope. It became clear that the laws derived from specific observations could not be applied outside of that specific context. The current validity of laws does not guarantee that they will remain valid in the future. From a scientific perspective, many of Newton’s theories were proven wrong. In particular, his laws do not apply to very small particles or at very high speeds. There are many other exceptions as well. Notably, human free will itself provides a strong exception. Humans are autonomous in their actions and are not bound by any mathematical law. The concept of reward and punishment in this world and the hereafter is based on good and evil, as well as human choice. In secular sciences, the concepts of good, evil, and human choice are highly confused because, in a mechanical world governed by laws, there is no room for such concepts.\n10. The Toxic Foundations of Western Social Sciences\nSecular knowledge has limited reason and observation to the external world, but most Muslims have failed to understand these restrictions. The majority of Muslim thinkers believe that since the Quran encourages the use of reason and observation to acquire knowledge, there is no fundamental difference between the methods of acquiring knowledge in Islamic teachings and Western sciences. However, the early verses of the Quran describe the characteristics of the righteous as those who believe in the unseen. The fundamental principle of secular thinking, however, is the denial of the unseen. This denial leads to a rejection of God, the Day of Judgment, and the concept of accountability in the hereafter, as well as the secular claim that this rejection is required by reason. The truth is that denying the unseen is itself irrational. The result of this denial is the claim that the universe came into existence on its own, because its Creator must necessarily be outside the bounds of the universe, and our observation cannot go beyond the universe. Despite being against reason, secular thinkers still claim that the universe came into existence on its own. Gradually, inanimate objects came together and became living beings, and through the process of evolution, humans emerged. The central characteristic of this process of evolution is a brutal competition: either we tear others apart and devour them, or they will tear us apart. The law of the jungle is the only law that applies—the right to live belongs solely to the powerful. Obviously, such a concept may be suitable for life in the wilderness but not for building a human society.\nToday, the destructive effects of these toxic ideas are in plain sight. There is an unending series of wars, in which countless innocent lives are deliberately sacrificed to gain power and profit. The leader of the so-called \"civilized\" world, America, which claims to be the most advanced civilization in humanity, manufactures and exports ten times more weapons than the rest of the world. It is said that wars are merely a way to increase arms sales. Statistics show that there is much truth in this claim. The entire world has been devastated by the idea that everything is permissible in the pursuit of power, wealth, and luxury. Millions of land and sea creatures are slaughtered. These wars have caused so much environmental damage that the future of human life on Earth is in jeopardy. Western social sciences have not only brought death and destruction across the globe but have also destroyed the family—the basic unit of human society—in the West itself. More than fifty percent of children in the West are born to unmarried mothers. Children deprived of the love and security of a home with both parents, never learn to love others selflessly throughout their lives.\nOut of ignorance and inferiority complexes, Muslims have equated Western social sciences with Western scientific knowledge, and they remain engaged in the futile exercise of trying to sift out the correct ideas and discard the wrong ones. However, Western secular knowledge is like the Dajjal—it has a sharp eye for the external world but is blind to the inner world of the human being. An Islamic society cannot be built on the concept that humans are merely animals. One of the major causes of the corruption in our Islamic societies is that we are trying to run our societies according to Western principles. Our systems of governance are based on Western parliamentary democracy rather than the Islamic system of the caliphate and shura (consultation). Our courts enforce Western laws and apply Western principles to Muslim societies. Our economies are operating according to the principles laid out by the Jews. Numerous un-Islamic influences have permeated our society. Today's Islamic society reflects the hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) foretold that this Ummah would follow in the footsteps of the Jews and Christians, even if they were to enter a lizard's hole. The root of all these problems is the educational system, which teaches our generations to revere the West and Western knowledge. As long as this system continues to poison the minds of millions of Muslim youth, no proposal for the revival of the Ummah will be effective.\n11. The Failed Attempts to Combine Western and Islamic Sciences\nMost Muslims agree that the current educational system, which completely neglects Islamic intellectual heritage, is not suitable for Islamic societies. Consequently, numerous Islamic educational institutions are being established throughout the Islamic world. The common approach of these institutions is to teach Islamic sciences alongside Western sciences. Can these institutions solve our problem? In our view, the answer is no. The reasons for this are detailed below.\nCurrently, the entire world operates under the capitalist system. All parts of this system—politics, law, society, economy, and education—are interconnected. The role of the educational system is to instill in students a desire for wealth and a luxurious life, and to help them obtain high-paying jobs to fulfill this desire. These jobs make students part of the capitalist system. If we teach students through Islamic education that Islam provides us with the best system, which encompasses all aspects of life, but then prepare the same students to become part of the capitalist system and strengthen this un-Islamic system, our Islamic education becomes mere rhetoric. On the one hand, we claim the superiority of Islamic knowledge, yet on the other hand, we train our students to rely on a non-Islamic system for their livelihood.\nAs mentioned earlier in this essay, fifty years ago, the thinkers of the Islamization of knowledge movement recognized the central role of an Islamic educational system in the revival of Islam. As a result of their efforts, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) established two Islamic universities where Islamic sciences and contemporary sciences are taught together. However, these universities have also failed to chart a new intellectual course for the Islamic world. The primary reason is that both universities prepare students for jobs within the capitalist system. The students themselves understand this, which is why they are not particularly interested in the Islamic subjects—they neither help them secure jobs nor enable them to acquire more valuable worldly knowledge. Besides these universities, some individuals have, with lofty ambitions, attempted to establish institutions that offer a complete Islamic educational system, where spiritual training, character-building, and worldly knowledge are all taught. Yet, no successful model has emerged, and even if one were to be developed, it would not solve our problems. As long as the thousands of existing institutions continue teaching our youth the principles of Western society and the superiority of those principles, the formation of an Islamic society will remain impossible.\n12. Proposed Plan of Action\nSo, given the failure of many attempts, how can we create a viable path to progress? The first thing to understand is that secular knowledge is itself a religion. It teaches students how to live and what the purpose of life is. The current economics textbooks openly state that the goal of our lives is to maximize pleasure. Just as Christianity or Buddhism cannot be Islamized, secular social sciences cannot be molded into an Islamic form. The hidden beliefs embedded within these sciences must be exposed and refuted. We cannot achieve this by creating separate institutions or by teaching an additional subject like Islamic economics. We need to teach the same subject, such as Western economics, but in a different way. We should explain that Western nations believe that the foundation of economics is selfishness, hedonism, competition, and individualism. In contrast, Islam teaches us values like generosity, simple living, cooperation, and community. We need to change the objectives and methods of education within the existing institutions. Having spent my entire life in these Western educational institutions, first as a student and then as a teacher, my experience tells me that while this task is difficult, it can be done. However, a natural question arises here: after teaching all this philosophy, won’t our students still be forced to seek jobs in the capitalist system? And if that happens, won’t all this philosophy become meaningless?\nTo answer this question, it is important to understand that a significant portion of Western education is dedicated to brainwashing. In this segment, students are taught how to think about the world and themselves. Students are taught that the purpose of education is to get a job, and that they are not human beings but \"human resources\"—raw material to be sold in the marketplace. We can openly refute these ideas. We should teach our students that humans are the most valuable creation of Allah. Our lives cannot be measured in money, and we are not commodities to be bought and sold in the marketplace as human resources. We should encourage our students to make the intention that they will use their education to serve the Ummah, not for personal gain. If we shape their minds in an Islamic manner, this will not hinder them from finding jobs. However, their purpose in seeking jobs will change. Rather than pursuing personal luxury, they will be working to fulfill their responsibilities. Moreover, we can teach students agriculture and trade, which will make them self-sufficient and free from the need to seek jobs. Teaching is also an excellent field, providing ample opportunities for Islamic mental development in students. In short, if we do everything that is possible in the current world, Allah will open the way for further progress.\nIn reality, we do not need to Islamize Western knowledge—we already possess far superior knowledge. We need to Islamize our education system, which currently mimics the West and promotes many secular ideas that conflict with Islam. The most important goal of Islamic educational institutions should be character development—a domain completely absent from Western education. It is not only necessary to incorporate this into our current educational system, but it must also be given a central role in education. How this can be done is a separate and lengthy discussion, which we will leave for another time. Moreover, specific strategies are needed to Islamicize each field of education. For example, medical students should be taught that saving a life is equivalent to saving all of humanity, as stated by Allah. We should work with the intention to earn this reward. Similarly, in engineering and other technical and scientific fields, for the time being, the content can remain Western, but the intention will be to serve humanity and to recognize the signs (ayat) of Allah in the external world. However, the approach must be very different for the social sciences.\nWestern social sciences are the lessons that the West learned from its religious wars. These lessons teach us how to build a secular society in which religion plays no role. We must completely reject these lessons and insist that we will build an Islamic society based solely on Islamic foundations. Once this goal is clear, we have an abundance of resources to accomplish it. Our entire body of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) teaches us how to build an Islamic society. Additionally, we have the example of a thousand years of dominance of the Islamic civilization, from which thousands of practical models for modern times can be drawn. A great deal of work has already been done in this area, which can serve as a foundation for further progress. Forming a society according to Islamic principles is our religious obligation. If we take up this challenge and dedicate ourselves to it, Allah will help us in ways we cannot imagine.\n\"If you are loyal to Muhammad (peace be upon him), then we belong to you.\nWhat is this world? Even the tablet and the pen are yours.\"\nAt the end of this essay, we pray to Allah to illuminate our hearts with the light of faith, make it easy for us to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and guide the Ummah out of its current darkness into the light of His recognition.",
