      "content": "I have an Etsy shop called Nur creative studio and The Nur Coop - I want to take This content and write a listing taking into consideration all the best practices Etsy has shared\n“””Transcription:  \nOkay. I hope you don't mind. I wanted to write it up for you, but I don't want to wait too long before sending you something. I'm not sure when you're going to need it, so I'll send you a voice note.\n\nThe hands are a product of me and Josephine spending three months in India, and we had spent the first month in the Dharamsala in the north, where the Dalai Lama lives and has his Mini Tibet. It's a very interesting area. In India. They welcomed tibetan refugees and gave them this area where I think it used to be like a british resort or retreat or something for the military.\n\nAnd we were there for some time because I was a part of something called the compassionate leadership summit, and we were invited to ask a question, basically, to the Dalai Lama. And so both she and I were in the mood of connection, spirituality, and I've been interested in spiritual reality, spirit reality, like the truth that you find when you squint between traditions. And so one of my friends is an indian artist, and she offered us her home after the time in Dharamsala, where Josephine was going to do her art retreat and have access to the Pink palace studio that my artist friend has and to spend some time in creativity and making. And I technically had returned to work to bloom, but I was, I think, infected with this idea, actually.\n\nIt's connected to Noor's idea of helping people see the world as a source of beauty, connecting them with craftsmanship, the people that make their products and the lands that they come from. And so while I was in India, I do what I often do is ask, like, what's unique about this place that we could share and share with people? And so what's interesting about Jaipur, where we were, is that it's a brass manufacturing city. It's known for its brass, it's known for its camel leather, and it's known for its miniature painting.\n\nI think there are many minerals and mountains full of gems that they grind up and use in these very ornate detail miniature paintings. And so I was, ah, man, I've always loved watercoloring, and I've had, I always have my watercolor box. I carry it with me everywhere I go. And I got really excited about the idea of making a brass watercolor, something.\n\nI'm not exactly sure how this idea started. I think, you know, the muslim tradition, you use your fingers to count the prayer. And I've been thinking about art and how often art can be used as well. You know, there was a trend in modern art to kind of poke fun at and make commentary about commerce and commercialism.\n\nSo, you know, Andy Warhol and art that you can screen print and make a thousand copies of something versus just one standalone, unique thing using the same processes, all that, all that kind of stuff, the Campbell tomato soup and then the art of the ego or something like that. Like a Damien Hirst kind of like doing something that is, that creates shock, right? Like encrusting a skull with diamonds and, I don't know, hanging like a yemenite shark dipped in formaldehyde or something in a gallery. I can't remember exactly, but I was remembering a time period before artists used to sign their names on their works, where they were using art to kind of be a way to share the beauty that they saw, often either in a tradition.\n\nSo a lot of mystical art and spiritual art does that with calligraphy or patterns or mandalas and things like that, or in nature. And sometimes they're mixed, as often seen in islamic art. And so I was wanting to say that art can be a thing that we use to connect with ourselves and with beauty and to tie it to some of these traditions. And two of the traditions present in India are the muslim tradition and the hindu tradition.\n\nAnd so what, it kind of merged and started evolving and came into this way of, you know, you open the hand, and just like a Muslim would count on their fingers, their prayers, you kind of mimic that pattern when you're using the brush, and you're kind of, you know, you can imagine the hope. The intent is that people use that and kind of have this experience of imagining touching your hand or their hand and making the remembrance, which is the name of that kind of prayer. When they use their fingers, the Muslims, they remember different qualities of God or different things that are supposed to help them connect with the present moment. And it's kind of interesting that it's a tactile sensation.\n\nIt's a very embodied faith if you see the prayer as well. And then the box has the two positions, right? So when it's closed, it's in the namaste position, where the palms are facing each other. And then when it's open, it's in the more traditional islamic prayer position, two hands, palms up, pinky to pinky.\n\nAnd so all this symbolism is packed inside of it, and it's handmade out of teak and copper clad cover. And I couldn't get the brass. Like, initially, I wanted it to be solid brass, but it wasn't working out. It was gonna be way too expensive.\n\nAnd so this was the compromised teak is a waterproof, water resistant wood. And the areas inside of the hand, the palm, have more copper cladding where you can mix the colors. And that's the story of the hand. I could transcribe this, but I hope this is interesting and helpful.\n\nAnd I would love to hear kind of what stood out to you out of the whole story. And if you. Yeah, what is. What do you think about the idea of creating products that start conversations?\n\nAnd that's kind of my hope with this thing, is that we'll start talking about, like, well, what is art anyway? What is it for? What can it be? What is the history of art and spirituality?\n\nAnd how does that show up today? How does it show up for me? How does it show up for me in a very simple practice that I hope is connecting you to a place in the world. And these craftspeople actually in India, whom I also, you know, I spoke with the representative in the company that will help me make these hands.\n\nAnd these are often places where you can have kind of a classist, stratified society in India. And so the people that wind up making things are from lower caste, and Jaipur is no exception. But while speaking with the guy that is helping us produce this stuff, I made sure that I was able to get in touch with the workers and that they're being paid fairly and that they're happy with their work. And I am happy to share a product that has these principles attached.\n\nAnd also with the teak, making sure that it's harvested in an appropriate way. Okay, I hope you're doing well. I hope this is a ten minute long message describing the story of a product.”””\n\nI want you to ask me 10 deep questions to help you write the most compelling Etsy post and to help me figure out how to sell these hand carved product I have 20 and it’ll take at least 2 months to get a new production batch - what price it might be without any paint. Or with 12 different pans \n",
