      "content": "Review this conversation and summarize. What are the agreed upon todos? Extract your insights and suggest what you think is for me given what you know about me \n\n\"\"\"00:02: You set your priorities and then you can tap into the library, tap into finding some of your own activities.\n00:12: But we want to help you, like, get some of that one on one time.\n00:18: And, and ideally the mentors or coaches also have a bit of experience.\n00:24: You know, we, in part of our orientation for them, we go through to help them tap into the library of activities so that when they're conversing with the teams and going over what they think they're working on, they can tap into their own brain and experience, but they can also tap into the library.\n00:46: And maybe even this is, by the.\n00:47: Way, because it makes me miss the mentor form on our platform and the way that we had these things.\n00:56: I also, I also missed the, the notes section.\n01:00: Like the, you know, we used to have these stars and like the things that you fill out and like, those were cool.\n01:08: Yeah, let step by step.\n01:12: Yeah, yeah.\n01:14: But the mentor form doesn't have to be on the platform to be a mentor form.\n01:17: Like, we could just make a mentor form.\n01:19: There's a journal.\n01:20: What?\n01:20: There's a journal.\n01:21: They have a journal.\n01:22: Yeah, perfect.\n01:24: Yeah.\n01:25: So, yeah, should we have them, like, take a screenshot of their assessment and put in the journal just like, so that they have something to reflect on with them and.\n01:39: Because one of the things that I.\n01:40: Mentor becomes a part of the team and can look at the, look at the results maybe, or put it as a snapshot as well, something easy, just.\n01:49: Like to make things actually work.\n01:51: And yeah, one of the things that I was reflecting on that I didn't really like so much is I know we want people to use the platform, but sometimes I feel like we make decisions that suck for people just so they use the platform, you know, that are not like, they're not fun, they're not fluid.\n02:06: It's not like, oh, hey, let's just invite the mentor.\n02:09: And it becomes like a whole bunch of steps.\n02:11: Nobody does it.\n02:12: And we get worse results in quality.\n02:13: And I want to do that anymore.\n02:15: I just want to do what the right thing is until the platform is good enough to do it right.\n02:18: And we can actually prove if we need to do it, like, if we ask them to put it into the mentor, like, notes as a screenshot and it's working really great and they're like talking and it's dynamic.\n02:27: Then we say, yeah, hell yeah, we put it in the platform and make it easy to do mentor notes there.\n02:31: But if we do the thing and the mentor's like, ah, I ignore that data, you know, and I don't Know how to deal with it.\n02:36: I don't understand.\n02:37: Then we can actually refine that process and we can understand better anyway.\n02:41: Yeah, sure.\n02:42: I mean, I guess the different levels.\n02:44: Let's put the screenshot in the document and then also add the mentor to the team so they have a link.\n02:49: Because if the mentor wants to actually look at the results, they can.\n02:53: And then I think ultimately looking at.\n02:56: The results is more of a language like Bilal said.\n02:59: Because ultimately what happens is that the teams might be ranking really high and I don't know, like products and services, but this is their priority.\n03:07: So they will choose it as a priority in their work plan.\n03:10: What really matters is the work plan and the objectives in it.\n03:15: Exactly.\n03:16: I mean, I guess that's part of it in my mind is that it really is the work plan.\n03:21: But I still, you know, we've had a number of those experiences where people think that they need, that they need this, this is their blocker.\n03:31: And then they go through the assessment and they realize that there are these other things that were there that they, they didn't even have on their.\n03:38: In their viewpoint that is actually blocking them.\n03:42: And so somehow giving that aspect of, of it as a tool for that 30,000 foot view to help them with the prioritization process.\n03:58: Yeah, something like that.\n03:59: How do you know?\n04:00: You don't know that you need to know something like that to take to mentor sessions.\n04:15: Can mentors gain insight from a broader.\n04:22: Well and first and foremost, is it helpful to the participants so, you know, just having them go through and get that view?\n04:33: Yeah.\n04:36: Okay.\n04:39: Do we want to make any decisions now?\n04:43: Because we have a program coming up and we need to kind of address like what do we do with entrecomp and well being?\n04:50: Or is.\n04:51: Is this like, let's have another meeting after this with more clarity.\n04:57: And I mean, I guess part of my question to Dot, especially to dad, is what do you think about this process of.\n05:07: Basically we think of reducing the curriculum so we know that time is limited and so we don't want to add more without reducing somewhere.\n05:19: So if we reduce the curricular demands, but we elevate a bit the time that goes into the reflection, the planning process, etc.\n05:32: I mean, I even like what Bilal said of that.\n05:36: You should do at least one organizational and one personal assessment.\n05:42: Maybe we invite or we encourage them to do the three personal assessments, but they need to do at least one of them.\n05:50: Or maybe we just say like just do all of them and we've been somehow incorporated into time, incorporated into, you know, maybe it shouldn't be like our collaboration time because people should be able to do that on their own.\n06:03: But anyway, so we put a bit more emphasis on that and then we really do bring.\n06:09: Have more of the time of the program, the mentor time and you know, mentor time with one of the things I was thinking about with Myrna Mira's in Lebanon, right?\n06:28: Yeah, so more one on one.\n06:35: Sorry.\n06:37: She has both experience and personal and organizational, which is what's interesting about her.\n06:43: Okay, so I was thinking about the.\n06:46: The aspect of more one on one time relationship time, trust building time, etc with people who can of course help them in those areas, but with people who.\n06:57: Whose network itself will help people with their organization.\n07:02: Now if Myrna had.\n07:03: So if teams want to go into Dubai, if part of their growth trajectory is they want to grow, they want to launch etc into Dubai, then we connect them to a mentor in Dubai who yes, is going to help them with their business plan, but is going to directly as a person be able to connect them into their networks and then is developing a trusted relationship.\n07:24: So the aspect of trust, you know, so much of startup process and organizational growth, etc.\n07:35: Is your personal network and people in developing countries, in difficult places, etc.\n07:44: In my mind very often just don't have access to the decision makers, to the people who are actually making buying decisions, who are going to be able to connect them into whatever will help them next.\n07:58: And so if we can help people develop those trusted relationships with people who will unlock doors for them while helping them with their personal growth stuff, then, then I thought that could be really helpful.\n08:15: And this is so much of what Y Combinator does, of what other accelerators do.\n08:21: This is stuff that, you know, thinking of all of this, you know, I know this is not like the good examples, but thinking of like, you know, what we're learning from Trump in business and Silicon Valley, etc.\n08:34: Etc.\n08:34: Is that so much revolves around personal relationships and people who are in developing places in these marginalized communities don't have access to those people.\n08:47: So could we help them develop and nurture those relationships?\n08:50: Basically, how can we?\n08:54: Okay, so to answer your question, Munir, I think this is great.\n08:57: I love the idea.\n08:58: I think we should spend a lot more time in one on ones and a lot less time in cohort.\n09:02: At least more meaningful time in cohort than what's currently happening.\n09:07: However, this is something we have to bring up to the I Study foundation because it's in the proposal.\n09:14: The number of training sessions and the measuring Pre post on well being ENL and ecat.\n09:21: All of that is, is in the proposal so we'll need to bring it up with them.\n09:25: And the other thing to keep in mind is a lot of the mentors are asking about remuneration.\n09:32: Like the volunteer thing isn't cutting it anymore.\n09:34: There are some that are like yeah, I'll volunteer and I'm happy to give back to the community but people need to make money.\n09:40: We're in very economically dire situation right now.\n09:43: Everywhere, not just in Lebanon.\n09:45: I mean this is, I guess this is everywhere, not just in Lebanon.\n09:50: Yeah.\n09:58: I mean look, this is, I hate to say this but like.\n10:05: Well, I mean I, I don't know exactly.\n10:07: I know that like a lot of people do, do mentorship, not fee based and those are people who are well off enough obviously to not do that.\n10:17: But it's honestly, I mean it feels like we probably need more mentors who don't need that because those are often the mentors who are going to be, they're going to have those stronger networks and deeper experience to be able to support the teams more.\n10:39: It's not that the mentors need like the teams need, of course they need support in terms of their, their personal development and their public speaking and improving their pitch deck etc, but they need access to those networks and develop trust with people who have, who are well networked, who are well experienced, who are successful, etc.\n11:02: Who are going to be able to tap into that.\n11:03: And not that mentors who are also have financial need don't have those but I think we need to tap into more mentors who are just well off wealthy, connected to wealthy decision makers.\n11:29: Yeah.\n11:32: You know, like it's one of these crazy things where like this, this bifurcated world where half the conversations that I have with people are that raising $50,000 is so high and like we raised a couple hundred dollars in the last campaign.\n11:54: It was, you know, pretty depressing.\n11:58: And then the other half of conversations that I'm having and I met up with Krista Berlin Court again last night and she was saying how the Earthshot prize in the UK they only give a million dollars to each team.\n12:17: It's not that much money.\n12:21: Exactly.\n12:23: And how do we get people, how do we get more teams and ourselves connected to more of those people who have a ridiculous.\n12:35: Well, both either they have money but then also there are a lot of the buyers, there are the governments, there are the corporates, there are others who have a lot of money and we need to connect into those networks.\n12:48: More and the teams need to connect into those networks more who say like, hey, you want to run a pilot?\n12:54: Yeah, sure, here, let's run a pilot.\n12:58: It looks legit.\n12:59: It's going to provide value to our corporate, to our government, to our.\n13:02: Something like that.\n13:04: Let's run a budget for $150,000 into a pilot with the teams or something like that.\n13:09: You know, Fabricade.\n13:11: Connecting into all of these companies in the UAE who spend, you know, they connect into companies in Lebanon who want to do corporate gifts and they'll have a budget of 10 or $20 a team.\n13:24: They connect into companies.\n13:25: By the way, I'm just making this stuff up.\n13:26: I don't know.\n13:27: But they connect into corporates in Dubai and they might have a budget of 100 or $150 per, per item.\n13:33: Sorry, not per team.\n13:35: And, and this is just such a huge difference for startups like where they, where they go.\n13:41: What is the level of means of like being able to run those pilots connected to those networks.\n13:45: Yeah.\n13:46: Anyway, not that we shouldn't have some paid ones or with people in Lebanon, but my sense is immediately now we need to like tap into our networks and encourage people to sign up from, you know, the nexuses.\n14:00: I don't know many.\n14:02: The what?\n14:04: I don't know any wealthy people.\n14:05: I mean my, my, my network is, you know, like, I don't know wealthy people unfortunately.\n14:13: Look, that's fine.\n14:14: I mean, you don't need to, I guess this is what like.\n14:16: Oh, you mean in terms of reaching out to mentors?\n14:19: Yeah, yeah, let's, let's work on reaching out to mentors through these different networks that we're part of.\n14:26: We're.\n14:27: I'm part of, I'm part of several networks.\n14:29: Bilal is as well, like the, well, I don't know, well being network.\n14:32: They're a little bit like maybe there's some people in that who are.\n14:35: But there are the funder Personas in the well being network.\n14:39: You know, they're trying to gather different philanthropic organizations and so none of those folk that are having, I mean my.\n14:48: Experience thus far with the wellbeing network is they're trying to do that but not actually sharing any of that with other people.\n14:55: Yeah, well, hey, let's work on developing some.\n14:58: And they're on some of the calls like there are the, these really hippie foundations and philanthropic organizations where some guy probably did ayahuasca once and then realized how he should spend his money or something like that anyway.\n15:12: But they exist.\n15:12: They're there.\n15:14: I met Them, met a couple of them.\n15:16: But I don't know, like if they're going to be great mentors or look.\n15:22: They don't need to be great mentors.\n15:24: But the question is, is there a 1 degree person of separation?\n15:27: Is there a good friend of theirs who would be a good mentor that then can help the team, the right team or us improve whatever we're doing in our framing and then in the right way be like, oh, you know what for that project.\n15:40: Let me introduce you to this person at the Lemelson Foundation.\n15:43: I have this good friend who's at Lemelson, you know, or whatever it is.\n15:48: Yeah.\n15:49: Okay.\n15:50: In terms of this, what I would say is if that, let's not get bogged down by the like, if you, if you folks agree that that is a helpful approach, that we spend a bit more time on the preparation, on the framing, etc.\n16:07: And then we're going to work to connect them with more mentors from these, a deep connected network, etc, then let's fit that in and let's start getting those messages out to mentors right away.\n16:20: Because right now as well, like before.\n16:23: And then before we start them and.\n16:27: Then I was going to just say, oh, about Aswadi.\n16:31: Okay.\n16:32: So I was thinking with Aswadi, by the way, with your thoughts, is we either we could run it by them or we could not run it by them.\n16:42: And we just are actually going to go through those things.\n16:45: But it's more the aspect of doing that in a more intimate way.\n16:50: So we said we're going to have a certain number of sessions with the.\n16:57: So could it be part of our follow up or our framework with the mentors is that they come up with some sort of specific action plan and the teams are going to do some of that specific learning, but it's more personalized, so it's not a cohort based learning activity.\n17:17: But the teams are going to have to be learning and doing stuff.\n17:19: But this is part of what they're doing with the mentors and then we're following up with them, et cetera.\n17:24: So is there some way that that modification could fit within what we're already aligned with, with the Asvati?\n17:30: What if every session had equal number of teams and mentors and then there was a short overview of the content and then breakouts, or at least smaller, more intimate breakouts, like two, three people.\n17:47: My experience mentors like the convenience of scheduling at their own convenience.\n17:52: Yeah.\n17:53: And also it's not like, well, maybe.\n17:55: These are paid mentors somehow, if we can Figure out how to do that.\n17:59: Look at some.\n18:01: It's.\n18:03: There's also something interesting like wait, I guess there's a balance.\n18:08: I see there's more mentor time and exposure to different people versus more depth of connection to fewer people.\n18:19: So how do.\n18:20: What is that balance of like we can keep bringing in new people to meet with the team, but then they're like spending a key part of each session one on one time being like who are you?\n18:30: What is your issue to then be able to provide support versus you know, maybe it's pairing each team with two mentors, not just one or something like that, but more depth.\n18:46: They like connect with them over multiple sessions.\n18:51: Yeah, but they could be depends on how many mentors we have that can commit to something like that.\n19:00: And then we can see.\n19:04: My fear.\n19:05: I'm sorry, go on.\n19:06: Yeah, then it would be a pretty intimate group.\n19:11: My fear is that once we talk about the payment side, the people who we really want are going to be way unaffordable if they, if they start thinking about this as this is like compensation time.\n19:28: These are people who make multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars as their salary and then they're going to say like if they then break that down to like an hourly rate or whatever it is.\n19:47: Yeah.\n19:48: So this might be like a whole other universe of things, but one of the things that I've been realizing is like, I don't like our sector, I don't like our sector.\n19:59: I don't think.\n20:00: I think a lot of BS is happening in impact spaces.\n20:04: I don't think we're actually doing that good of a job at saving the world.\n20:08: I think we're probably a part of the problem and I don't actually want to connects people with a bunch of millionaires because I kind of feel like if the problem is a result of the people that develop, manage and benefit from the systems, why should we recreate that mindset and attitude in others?\n20:27: And part of that is the A type personality that is the problem in the first place.\n20:31: And it kind of is like, oh well now what do we do?\n20:36: But is how I'm feeling these days partially because of Palestine, partially because of everything that we're seeing with just like the social impact space in general.\n20:45: And I'm getting more and more articulate about like the challenge and I think it's related to some historical and philosophical trends that relate to like western philosophy that we can talk about.\n20:54: But in, in the operational side it's like, do we really want to bring those people in to talk to our teams.\n21:00: Like, do we really want them to be inspired by these people?\n21:04: Like, sure, there's like some practical, technical things.\n21:06: But you know, they say like, how you do anything is how you do everything and that, you know, like, the medium is the message and the message is the medium.\n21:14: Like, there's something about the way that we are doing things that have to be different and I think it needs, like, to trust what's wanting to emerge.\n21:24: Like, there's different ways of like indigenous economics approaches and other.\n21:29: Like, what if those were our mentors?\n21:31: Right.\n21:31: And it'll look totally different.\n21:33: Like the kinds of things, like, sure.\n21:34: Like maybe we can get some sort of partnership with some Dubai thing that will, you know, hire a bunch of Bangladeshi people to manufacture the like locally made sweatshop labor for fabricated or something.\n21:47: I don't know.\n21:48: Like, but like, do we want.\n21:49: I'm not, I'm giving some random arbitrary examples.\n21:52: But like, I don't know, like, I've been feeling like this, like if these are the people and I'm not so sure, I want to kind of recreate this mindset with our teams and maybe make more space for a developing new way of thinking.\n22:05: Thinking and feeling and being and doing business.\n22:08: Right.\n22:08: Creating value, exchanging value, receiving value.\n22:11: I don't have a problem with business.\n22:13: I think there's like beautiful things that we can do and we need to be able to think about, you know, why isn't the impact space having the impact that it's having?\n22:23: Like, maybe part of the problem is the mind that thinks that calling it impact makes sense.\n22:28: You know, there's something dumb about that.\n22:35: I mean, look, the.\n22:37: I, I feel like I've been part of these two threads.\n22:40: Conversations.\n22:42: No, no worries.\n22:45: I've been part of these two threads of conversations lately.\n22:49: One is with people who work in the impact space who are trying to figure out what is that model and approach of how to engage and survive based on the old system, generate revenue, etc.\n23:10: Largely working on things that they don't really like to be able to do the things they do, like, or working with people who.\n23:16: Or organizations, etc, that they don't really like to be able to do the things they do.\n23:19: Like, and then this, these conversations around bioregionalism and working with local communities and indigenous communities and working on developing that system.\n23:35: Now, to be honest, various of those conversations, they're still trying to figure out how to do that and they're trying to figure how to do that while kind of doing a bit of the first approach.\n23:49: Yeah, it's like A slider.\n23:50: It's like a gradient, you know, like I've been coming up with this come alive framework.\n23:55: And you know, I think that the way of thinking about it is if, if you do more things in your day that make you come alive, the thing that you want to do rather than you have to do slowly over time, then those systems are also going to have to catch up with you.\n24:11: You know, we're not going to be able to like exit the system and starve to death by not buying any produce that wasn't imported from within 100 miles or whatever or something like that.\n24:21: But like, no, if we actually realize like, oh, you know what, I actually love meeting farmers and I love like going picking.\n24:29: So how about I pick more of my fruit?\n24:30: And that reinforces that leg of the new system, right?\n24:33: And it's not gonna be all your food, but it'll be part of it.\n24:37: And that kind of brings in resources into that new economy that we're hoping for and just gradually shifting.\n24:45: Look at, I guess my main thought with this is I love it, I support it.\n24:50: We can tap into some of those networks and see if we can find some of those people to join calls in this process as well.\n24:58: While at the same time is the people who are working with are really struggling and however we can help them the most the soonest.\n25:13: I also support, I mean, I remember this, this, this effort for example, of like, you know, trying to do import replacement stuff in Lebanon by helping people who create packaged foods to be creating packaged foods in Lebanon rather than importing those from Europe or from wherever they're made.\n25:32: Oh yeah, there was.\n25:33: And then thinking like, well, they're creating single use plastics.\n25:37: Yeah, well, we don't want to support people making things with single use plastics in Lebanon.\n25:42: Can they do something better?\n25:43: Like look, they're struggling and they're competing as all these freaking people who are using single use plastics.\n25:48: So sure, fine, let's, let's see if there's something that's possible to guide them towards something better.\n25:54: But in the meanwhile, having these people make stuff with single use plastics in Lebanon in my mind is still better than importing things in single use plastics from abroad, you know.\n26:06: Indeed, yes.\n26:07: Being practical and not starving to death or dying when we're trying to get things to work better.\n26:17: But I do think we need to at least flag things and help people see, you know, like, you know, I even don't even like using dollars.\n26:28: Once you start thinking about the implications of these systems that we're a part of you're like, holy shoot, this is bad.\n26:37: And it.\n26:39: Yeah.\n26:39: At least like point things out.\n26:42: This should be important.\n26:44: Maybe that could be a part of one of the assessments that we're trying to.\n26:48: It feels like the well being part needs the systemic well being elements as well.\n26:52: Like look, the more I have.\n26:56: I just finished the book Palo Alto.\n27:00: Oh.\n27:00: With the whole military funding.\n27:03: I mean look, to be honest, I would be happy to think of like we're all sitting here on Apple machines and Apple has done a lot of.\n27:11: Really up stuff and then even more so recently.\n27:14: I don't know if you heard about like the whole like giving their, their Israeli employees break days and I don't know, like all sorts of.\n27:23: Yeah.\n27:25: So how, Yeah, I mean how to do some of this stuff.\n27:32: Maybe, maybe we can work on shifting to, you know, what other.\n27:35: What are the ethical.\n27:37: Ethical equipment manufacturers over the coming couple years while not getting bogged down on that now.\n27:45: Because we just need to like I.\n27:48: Told you Mark Tulsa wanted to run a project in Syria.\n27:51: Right?\n27:51: Right.\n27:53: Hey, let's talk to him.\n27:54: And I mean I've been on and off.\n27:56: He's very practical and he's very much thinking about like foundational things that Syria needs like good businesses like prepackaged tomatoes and cans or whatever it is, you know, like that's, that's a good business.\n28:09: It's a country that needs almost everything.\n28:11: And so looking into to that and we could definitely bring in a very strong ethos in this moment in a country that basically needs to start from not scratch but like to really build.\n28:26: Build businesses that kind of set the, the trend of what it looks like to build businesses and how and for whom and to talk about like businesses that unite and connect and like are conscious of.\n28:43: Anyway, I think it would be interesting.\n28:45: He calls it like follows Islamic principles.\n28:49: And I can do a translation.\n28:51: Islamic principles.\n28:54: Yeah.\n28:54: And I can do a translation of that into all the indigenous stuff if you want.\n28:58: And but yeah, like he wants to do it.\n29:01: It's.\n29:01: It's not a huge project, but it is, it's exciting.\n29:05: And even as far like we're working currently with a funder that I think could totally understand what we're talking about.\n29:12: It's not out of the picture to say like these are the kinds of things that we're looking to support and why, and why we need a new kind of.\n29:19: We're not talking about assessments anymore.\n29:20: Dara, by the way.\n29:22: Yeah, I know, I'm, I've been listening the whole time.\n29:24: But also I don't know if you've heard that Abd al Rahman is moving on from the Asfari Foundation?\n29:31: Yeah, there's a new director.\n29:33: Another new director?\n29:35: Yeah.\n29:35: Again, not as.\n29:37: Not CEO.\n29:38: Oh, wait.\n29:39: And the new CEO, Dada.\n29:41: Programs Director.\n29:43: Okay.\n29:43: And you have programs.\n29:47: Yeah, you know, you know where he's going?\n29:49: Oh, sorry.\n29:50: Go on.\n29:50: Dada.\n29:53: He's moving on to their world.\n29:55: He's gonna be working with Angela.\n29:57: No way.\n29:58: Really?\n29:58: Well, I don't know.\n29:59: I don't know about with Angela.\n30:01: He's just working in their world, which is also where Angela sometimes does some consulting work.\n30:05: Interesting.\n30:07: Oh, it is UK stuff.\n30:09: Okay.\n30:10: Yeah.\n30:13: Do we want to make at least some progress on thinking about this assessment stuff, or do we want to think about, like, systemic issues?\n30:28: Any, any, any suggestion we want to bring up with Aswari?\n30:32: I just say can we keep it really simple for them?\n30:37: They are kind of thinking about some of the stuff, but not so much in ways that we are always.\n30:44: And they have them just a bureaucratic process.\n30:47: So we talk to Abbott or this other guy.\n30:50: They're very nice.\n30:50: But then if it's a big change, then they're gonna have to go talk to their board or they have to go talk to their managers and then talk to the board or whatever this stuff.\n30:57: We have a contract.\n30:58: We already signed the contract.\n30:59: It's already getting started.\n31:00: So I wouldn't suggest that we do stuff that's very complicated with them.\n31:05: Moreover, more.\n31:07: More than that is, can we think of how we work on whatever changes we think are lovely and beautiful and important and fit it into the framework that we already have with them.\n31:20: Munir, though, I think if we have minimal changes that we're doing to the program, better to do them while Abed is still here to advocate for us.\n31:28: How.\n31:29: How long?\n31:29: Sure.\n31:30: Because then it becomes more complicated.\n31:33: It becomes more what?\n31:35: It becomes more complicated.\n31:36: Like, the guy needs to understand us.\n31:38: He doesn't have any background on us.\n31:40: He's still getting to know us.\n31:41: He doesn't know if he has to go to the board for every decision.\n31:44: And it's like, it's gonna take more.\n31:46: We can, we can bring it up soon.\n31:48: I'm just, I'm just saying can we have whatever feels to them like a change that then they would have to talk about as minimal as possible?\n31:55: I mean, for example, if we just say, hey, folks, we're going through the same process, we're just going to reduce the full cohort time and give more one on one time.\n32:06: Hey, Abed, we just want to let you know, we're going to be trying this approach of less full cohort time, more one on one time.\n32:14: Do you have any thoughts or something like that?\n32:16: Maybe that's the extent versus, like, you know, I don't think we should bring up to them something about like, hey, Abed, you know, can we explore not doing stuff in any currency connected to a colonial power?\n32:30: That's a little bit more complicated now.\n32:32: Especially that they're shifting us with our contractors now.\n32:35: Not in UK pounds for this cycle.\n32:37: Our contract is in US dollars.\n32:39: No, as an ease, as an ease of process for them because they were facing all sorts of currency exchange issues, whatever it was.\n32:47: I don't know.\n32:47: That's funny.\n32:55: Okay, look, so in terms of some of the practical steps though, like in my mind, as I understand it now, first off, if there are some adjustments we want to make in the assessments, then, you know, that's a whole like internal process.\n33:10: And we have, you know, if it's an assessment related to the open house, then we have like a couple days to make those changes.\n33:18: If it's an assessment related to the program, we have a month to make those changes.\n33:23: So if we need to just think, you know, modestly of what might be possible with that.\n33:35: Now, one of the, one of the things that we could possibly do is like even the aspect which as I understood that one of the changes you were selecting, Bilal, doesn't even have to be a change on the platform really, which is just encouraging people to give more evidence.\n33:55: It's like when you're going through and doing the assessment, write evidence in the notes, that can just be like an instruction we give and we guide them through that process.\n34:03: That's not like an online technical change.\n34:05: That's a programmatic process change that we do to like help slow people down.\n34:16: But in the aspect of like, so we can think through that assessment of like, what are some of the specific assessment related modifications we want to make now in terms of the stages, we did talk about changing more of the stages to align of the different assessments to align with the ENTRECOMP stages.\n34:34: So shifting away from the 1, 2, 3, 4, which was vague and not so clear to the, you know, the, the stages that have a bit more substance to them.\n34:45: Yeah, we spoke about having entrepreneur the ecat and then having an ECAT skills assessment with the categories aligned with the entrepreneurship and leadership skills levels, which wouldn't be a very difficult one as well if we wanted to try.\n35:02: You mean categories?\n35:03: An ECAT skills?\n35:04: An ECAT skills one, yeah.\n35:07: These.\n35:08: So anyway, we can think through some of those assessment adjustments, but then the basic lens of, I guess again going back to data on like a practical level.\n35:21: Okay, so we start working now to get more mentors from these diverse groups and let's get mentors from the.\n35:26: You know, I think of it as the two sides, I guess.\n35:28: B loud one is the nexus group, which is the people who made money in the old system and work in the old system and can support in the old system, but providing some of that value impact stuff of some way.\n35:43: And then also trying to connect to the bioregional networks and these other groups and saying, hey, can some weaving lab, you know, can some of you folks also be volunteer mentors as well?\n35:56: And let's try to quickly get some volunteer mentors and see how we can really like expose them to more helpful people in these networks.\n36:08: And can we find some of the people who are in, you know, weaving lab and bioregional networks, etc.\n36:16: Who are also connected to ability to help the teams in really practical, tangible ways that they need?\n36:25: I think so.\n36:26: We're not talking about that larger number of teams and these different networks.\n36:29: And if we give it more time, let's reach out to them.\n36:31: I feel like now there's sort of a moment of more interest in the Levant and supporting these groups.\n36:38: And so can we tap into that and say like, hey folks, we need volunteer time working one on one with teams in these difficult countries.\n36:48: Can we, can we do that?\n36:50: Yeah.\n36:51: I don't know if you heard me, my recommendation or idea about like maybe in a very small way honoring the guy from Gaza who was part of like some of our programs that passed and I think like, yeah, somehow like connecting to like he, he was a part of the ecosystem and there's a.\n37:29: Yeah, there's something just in.\n37:31: I think it would be nice to, to honor this person and to kind of, you know, raised the question of like, what are, what are we doing?\n37:46: You know, like.\n37:49: Because I feel like if you start thinking about what happened, it kind of breaks apart a lot of veils.\n37:54: It really shows you a little bit of a different thought process around like social impact and like he had, he was a full bright fellow.\n38:02: He had all the accolades that you could want.\n38:04: He was like given props by, by everybody and somehow like wasn't worth like defending or stopping or.\n38:15: Yeah.\n38:17: What's his organization again?\n38:19: It was.\n38:23: Yeah.\n38:24: I'm still in touch with Muhammad Afifi.\n38:28: I been chatting with him and he now works for WFP doing education stuff in Gaza actually.\n38:39: Very interesting.\n38:42: Look, let's.\n38:43: I, I support it by the way.\n38:45: Both daughter and I are, I mean we're both doing at the mbsr, MBSR workshop, but we're also.\n38:54: You could host the mindfulness sessions.\n38:57: Yeah, sure.\n38:59: We're also just starting this trauma response program.\n39:04: Nine month trauma response program.\n39:10: You know, it's interesting what you say.\n39:11: There's both the like trauma response and the political response.\n39:16: And.\n39:21: Yeah, I bring it up because like I kind of don't want to just pretend like everything is normal somehow and then it doesn't affect us.\n39:31: I think like we should just be clear, like maybe we don't even know how we need to adapt and how we need to respond or where the, where the right funders are gonna come from or how we want to build new kinds of businesses that address deeper roots to the problems.\n39:49: But we can at least like honor this person and say that, you know, one way that we can honor his death is to ask what it means and what it means for us in this space and how we should be.\n40:05: We might not have the answers, but like, let's just hold that question and remember Barakh, something like that.\n40:15: Just to add, there's also now huge debates in the ecosystem surrounding Trump's announcement stopping international aid and US Aid basically are receiving stop work orders for everything except Egypt and Israel in the region.\n40:35: About.\n40:35: And so the debate is about like, how can anyone be surprised by this order?\n40:40: And the necessity to decolonize funding for local development.\n40:46: So yeah, where is that debate happening?\n40:51: Dara?\n40:54: You said that like in the networks or something where.\n40:56: Yeah, I mean I saw a couple of posts on, on LinkedIn go to Lama from Bullet Palestine.\n41:04: Yeah, profile she posted about it and I think another person that I can't.\n41:08: Remember who on LinkedIn though, or you on LinkedIn, you said, or where LinkedIn.\n41:14: Yeah, yeah, I think, I think it's important because like I was a part of some other meetings where stuff was happening and no one mentioned anything and it just felt like really elephant in the room, awkward, you know?\n41:32: Yeah.\n41:33: And I think it'll, it'll be like whitewashing.\n41:37: I don't know.\n41:37: We'll be a part of the problem.\n41:39: We should at least talk about it and maybe doing it through this lens of Taraq would be an interesting thing and I think, think maybe focusing more on the questions that it opens rather than the answers, but saying like, you know, there's a re.\n41:56: There's realities.\n41:57: You know, we live in a world that is very challenged.\n42:01: We live in A world where funding comes with all sorts of reasons, right?\n42:08: International development funding and you know, tax money from around the world supporting different initiatives.\n42:15: And I don't know how to say this in a public program, but maybe not even ask the questions but just say like what does it mean?\n42:24: Let's honor this person that has died.\n42:25: Let us acknowledge that we're living in very difficult times and we need to find new ways forward and new ways to fund these things.\n42:32: And hopefully your businesses will be a part of that process.\n42:36: You know, something like that.\n42:46: What's Lama's last name?\n42:50: Ahmed Amr.\n43:03: Okay.\n43:06: Okay.\n43:07: We have another call coming up in a few minutes.\n43:10: In terms of, in terms of this stuff like, I mean I think we definitely need to have another call on this but be like, I guess the discussion of the, of the assessments is what we have limited time and capacity.\n43:37: So what do you think are the, the changes that you think are important within our capacity?\n43:45: I think about this now.\n43:47: A lot of the things that we talked about today, it's like just dropping stuff, making more space, focusing more on the reflection and the community and you know, like if, if Abed and as far isn't desperate for pre post graphs showing changes in every single like framework.\n44:06: I don't think it's necessary.\n44:07: I, I like like what you said and it's, it's exactly how I think about it.\n44:11: Oftentimes just looking at the categories during the, the boot camp, looking at the categories and like getting people to understand that these things are you know, kind of a full circle view of something important and that there's ways that you can deepen and explore and interact with these things I think is great.\n44:31: And then focusing on like relationships, agency and the ecat and the thing that actually operates and operationalizes these things with potentially minimal changes to like at least have some kind of dynamic thread.\n44:46: So it's not just like you ping it in the beginning and then you drop it.\n44:49: But like we do that ping in the beginning and we find a light touch way of integrating it into the work plan.\n45:00: We, we may or may not want to add this like well being session that does add more complexity.\n45:06: And so like what are the fewer number of things that we can change?\n45:10: And I think it would just be focus on the ecat work on identifying them as frameworks, not things that we want to measure pre post and then measure or you know, keep track of the conversation through a running process.\n45:28: Whether or not it's going to be a number.\n45:29: I'll think about it a little bit but, like, maybe it could just be a work plan modification where people are saying, like, this is the one that's been troubling me the most this week, or this is the one that I'm finding flow in this week.\n45:39: And here's how it, like, relates to my overall work plan.\n45:43: Something.\n45:44: Something like that.\n45:46: The other one, like, adds, like, another twist.\n45:49: It's.\n45:49: It's hard to keep it all.\n45:51: It's hard to keep it all in mind.\n45:52: But, like, the.\n45:53: The entre comp, I was thinking just, well, being an ecat.\n45:57: But like, entre comp.\n46:00: Should we drop it?\n46:01: Like, why are we doing it right now?\n46:03: We have something that focuses on, well, being the E.\n46:06: CAT focuses on.\n46:08: They'll need skills to be able to do the E.\n46:10: CAT.\n46:10: We do want some kind of universal skill.\n46:14: Universal skills is for.\n46:16: For school children.\n46:17: That's why we moved away from it.\n46:19: No, but the language of universal skills is what I'm talking about.\n46:21: I don't like saying soft skills, but that's what entre comp is anyway, so.\n46:25: Exactly.\n46:25: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n46:26: Okay.\n46:26: So entre camp is basically that it's for each individual on the team to say, I'm gonna focus on creativity, and I'm gonna focus on I don't know what.\n46:37: So.\n46:37: So each person will choose something.\n46:38: And now we have activities fleshed out for every category in ENL so they can choose an activity to work on during the acceleration.\n46:47: Also, by the way, like, and maybe in our last minutes.\n46:50: Let's just schedule another.\n46:52: Maybe in our.\n46:53: In our last minutes, we schedule another time to continue.\n46:58: Because my sense is also not to reduce those.\n47:03: But, like, so, yes, to have options.\n47:05: And maybe part of it, we have the spider charts.\n47:07: They don't have to do all of them, but for some of them still going through the process to do the full assessment.\n47:11: And it kind of reminds me of this aspect of, like, reading a book summary versus reading a book.\n47:18: And part of it is just sitting with that thing for longer and guiding people to take more time to reflect and that there's deep value in that.\n47:29: And sometimes I do, like, book summaries, and I, you know, go through and I say, hey, chatgpt, can you give me a chapter by a chapter summary of this book?\n47:38: And then I realized, okay, well, know that thing anyway.\n47:41: So are you trying to say that.\n47:43: We should spend more time with it?\n47:44: Like, how do we.\n47:46: How do we do that?\n47:46: You're saying that, like, actually ask them to take.\n47:49: For some of them, they take the full.\n47:50: For some of them, they take the full assessment to help with the, like the depth of the reflection process.\n47:56: But maybe not all of them.\n47:58: So anyway, let's think through what are the ones, or is there some optionality that they all do the enterprise one, but they pick one of the personal ones?\n48:05: But we still encourage them to actually take all of the personal ones.\n48:08: But just say that they need to take at least one of them.\n48:11: Or I mean, that we give a bit more space for that and we take that.\n48:15: Have this take, you know, some time.\n48:18: Yeah, I think, anyways, like.\n48:19: But that's part of the.\n48:20: That's part of the thing of the.\n48:21: Of the what's next of conversation.\n48:23: So why don't we.\n48:23: Because we got the call coming up, so let's pause there.\n48:25: Let's all think about these things.\n48:27: Yeah.\n48:27: And when do we.\n48:28: I mean, you and I have the call later today, tomorrow morning.\n48:33: By the way, that call is gonna be the middle of the night for you.\n48:35: Yeah, it's gonna be 5, 4:30 in.\n48:37: The morning almost every day.\n48:39: Okay.\n48:40: I just want to make sure that like, we.\n48:42: It wasn't a mistake of the time.\n48:43: No, no, it's just you.\n48:44: You are interrupting my prayer meditation and creative time.\n48:47: But you know, I could do it.\n48:50: A bit later if you want.\n48:50: You want to push it?\n48:51: It's better than the baby wakes up.\n48:54: Okay.\n48:55: Yeah.\n48:55: Okay.\n48:55: So 5:30, you know, maybe six is better.\n48:58: I don't know.\n48:58: Can you do an hour later?\n49:00: Yeah, sure, fine.\n49:01: Yeah, that way I get some of my.\n49:03: My early, early morning time.\n49:06: So one hour later from where it is.\n49:08: Yeah, just push it.\n49:10: Do you want me to send you some of the, like, things I've been thinking about?\n49:13: I wrote, did some writing.\n49:15: I shared some with with Dara, but she was like, he's got a lot on his plate.\n49:19: He's got no time to read that.\n49:21: So do you want me to read all the.\n49:24: Nope.\n49:25: Both.\n49:26: Send it over.\n49:26: I did read the stuff that you send.\n49:28: Yeah.\n49:29: Yesterday or day before into structuring it.\n49:31: So it's not.\n49:32: So send it over.\n49:34: Yeah, I have some time this afternoon, I think.\n49:36: I'll give it a shot.\n49:39: All right.\n49:42: All right, sounds good.\n49:45: Sounds good.\n49:48: Hello?\n49:49: Hello?\n49:50: Bye.\"\"\"",

      "content": "### **Summary of the Conversation & Agreed-Upon To-Dos**\n\nThe conversation focused on refining the structure of an upcoming entrepreneurship program, balancing mentorship, assessment processes, and funding models while reflecting on systemic issues in the impact space. \n\n### **Agreed-Upon To-Dos:**\n1. **Mentorship & Engagement Strategy:**\n   - Shift focus from large cohort-based training to more **one-on-one mentorship**.\n   - Ensure mentors are well-networked individuals who can provide **access to decision-makers**.\n   - Recruit mentors from **two pools**:\n     - Traditional business/impact leaders (e.g., Nexus group).\n     - Alternative thinkers (bioregionalism, indigenous economics, regenerative approaches).\n   - Explore paying mentors but **be mindful of the risks** (wealthy, experienced mentors might expect high compensation).\n   - Make mentor scheduling more **convenient and flexible**.\n\n2. **Assessment & Program Adjustments:**\n   - Reduce unnecessary pre/post measurements and focus on **qualitative engagement and reflection**.\n   - Maintain **ECAT** and well-being as core assessment frameworks.\n   - EntreComp framework may not be necessary—consider **dropping it**.\n   - Shift assessments from rigid scoring to **framework-based reflection** (e.g., identifying key personal and enterprise challenges).\n   - Keep an **interactive thread** in the assessment, integrating it into the work plan (e.g., participants noting their most relevant struggles or progress).\n   - Encourage teams to provide **evidence** in their assessments.\n\n3. **Program Structuring & Communication with Funders (Asfari Foundation):**\n   - **Minimize friction** with funders by keeping changes **simple and within contract terms**.\n   - Inform Asfari about shifting more time to **mentorship over cohort sessions**.\n   - Make **minimal changes** while Abed (the current contact at Asfari) is still in place to smooth approval.\n\n4. **Funding & Alternative Financial Models:**\n   - Address the **increasing economic stress** that makes unpaid mentorship less viable.\n   - Explore **alternative funding models** that align with values (not just corporate/business mentors).\n   - Leverage **philanthropic and indigenous economic models** rather than replicating traditional business success stories.\n   - Recognize the **disconnect between funding realities and program needs**, balancing pragmatism with ideals.\n\n5. **Deeper Reflection on the Social Impact Space & Next Steps:**\n   - Acknowledge **critiques of the impact sector** and the risks of perpetuating flawed systems.\n   - Discuss integrating **decolonized funding models** and exploring **bioregional approaches**.\n   - Consider honoring **Taraq** (a past participant from Gaza who was killed) by **framing a larger conversation** about what social impact means.\n   - Stay **attuned to shifts in international funding**, including the **US cutting aid** and its implications.\n\n6. **Next Steps & Scheduling:**\n   - **Schedule another call** to finalize assessment changes.\n   - Continue outreach for **mentors from both traditional and alternative networks**.\n   - Push the **next morning call one hour later** to accommodate personal priorities.\n   - Bilal will share some of his **written thoughts** for review.\n\n---\n\n### **Insights & Suggestions for Bilal**\n#### **What Stands Out for You:**\n- You **deeply resonate with systemic shifts** and want to **integrate alternative models** rather than just modifying existing systems.\n- You seem **frustrated with the impact space’s inefficacy** and are questioning the **values behind economic systems, mentorship, and funding models**.\n- You are naturally drawn to **frameworks that prioritize intrinsic motivation** over external metrics, which aligns with your resistance to excessive measurement in the program.\n\n#### **Suggested Focus Areas for You:**\n1. **Make the Program a Prototype for a New Approach**\n   - Instead of just tweaking existing models, **position it as a step towards a more regenerative, decolonized approach** to entrepreneurship support.\n   - Keep a **lighter measurement touch**, emphasizing **learning, reflection, and agency over rigid assessment**.\n\n2. **Lean into Storytelling & Alternative Mentorship Models**\n   -

      "content": "we're working on a pre-accelerator agreement contract where a participant in Bloom.pm's programs is committing to both, personal and professional development. \nWe want to have the participants realize and help them by agreeing to grow along these two dimensions. We follow the following process for assessing and supporting teams in the following three brackets [[[Section 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻 \nAlso here: Bloom Framework v0.9 - Two Pillars (draft)\nBloom's Training Framework offers a dynamic, adaptive learning environment for individuals, teams, and organizations through a guided project-based and cohort-based learning approach. It focuses on two core pillars:\nThe Individual: Featuring Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH), Universal Skills, Character Strengths, and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessments.\nThe Organization: Featuring the Organizational Development Assessment.\nThe framework helps assess core strengths and weaknesses, prioritizing areas for learning and development. Our goal is to simplify the creation of custom learning journeys, enabling teams and program managers to identify optimal learning opportunities, foster a supportive environment, and positively impact businesses.\nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for improvement across both pillars, ensuring simultaneous development and, for example, improving an individual's skill through activities that address core organizational needs.\nEntrepreneurs identify their priority development areas based on assessment results and customize their learning journey with program managers, co-creating a tailored curriculum for the cohort.\nOur framework is based on proven cohort-based and project-based learning methods combined with the power of mentorship. Peer learning enhances the experience, while project-based learning aligns objectives with a mission or vision, fostering intrinsic motivation. Using a flipped classroom approach, entrepreneurs first digest relevant content, reflect on their learnings, and apply them in their enterprises. They then meet with their cohort for peer feedback and mentorship, using what they learn in real-life settings.\nOur programs nurture individual and organizational development, promoting cooperation over competition and leveraging collective intelligence to solve pressing societal problems.\nThe Bloom Training Framework is versatile and can be used in various contexts, including companies, educational programs (youth, school, university), startup accelerators, and short events like startup sprints or hackathons.\n\nOur Principles\nWe use the following guiding principles to evaluate and prioritize program activities:\nKeep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat. (Upside down pyramid) \\/\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the teams in our programs to help them do the right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on extraneous, nonaligned activities. We want to keep the teams and participants in the driver's seat and help them develop decision-making skills. We can help people develop skills of effectiveness by creating an enabling environment. \nTransformation > Information. Make available knowledge actionable. (Library content)  \nPrioritizing transformative learning experiences over mere information dissemination ensures that knowledge is applied in meaningful ways. By providing actionable insights and practical tools, we create an environment where learning translates into real-world impact.\nGet the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessments)\nOptimizing team composition by aligning individual strengths and roles enhances overall team effectiveness. Through comprehensive assessments, we identify key areas for personal and professional growth, enabling targeted interventions that maximize individual and collective potential.\nWhy integrate individual growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team is determined by the development of each individual who comprises it. So, while personal development and well-being are also an end, we ensure that the teams are more robust and the organization is more likely to keep going. Instilling such resilience helps cultivate values-driven people and a community of social change makers with a growth mindset and a contributor attitude. \nCreate an enabling environment in the program and support the broader ecosystem.\nFostering a supportive community within cohort-based programs is essential for creating an enabling environment where entrepreneurs can thrive. By nurturing a culture of collaboration and mutual support, we enhance the learning experience and contribute to the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem. We win when we win together. \n\nPillar 1: The Individual\nBloom recommends the following individual development assessments:\nWellbeing & Engagement: at work & in life (through PERMAH)\nEntrepreneurship & Leadership Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of entrepreneurship and leadership \nCharacter Strengths: through VIA, Values in Action \nUniversal Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of work and life)\n 1.1. Wellbeing & Engagement \nOur Wellbeing and Engagement assessment is rooted in the principles of positive psychology and aims to measure human flourishing. This assessment evaluates six critical dimensions. These dimensions are essential indicators of a well-lived life, each contributing uniquely to an individual's overall sense of wellbeing.\nPositivity: Measures the extent to which an individual experiences positive emotions, crucial for enhancing resilience and overall mental health.\nEngagement: Assesses the level of involvement and absorption in activities, reflecting a flow state where individuals are fully immersed and find deep satisfaction.\nRelationships: Evaluates the quality of an individual's connections with others, recognizing that supportive and fulfilling relationships are fundamental to wellbeing.\nMeaning: Gauges the sense of purpose and direction in life, indicating how much individuals feel their lives have significance and contribute to something greater.\nAchievement: Measures the accomplishment of goals and the sense of mastery, highlighting the importance of setting and achieving personal and professional objectives.\nHealth: Assesses physical wellbeing, acknowledging that a healthy body is essential for overall life satisfaction.\nUsing the PERMAH framework, we ensure our programs focus on professional success and personal flourishing. This approach helps individuals and organizations achieve sustainable success by aligning personal wellbeing with organizational goals. \n1.2. Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\nThe Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessment evaluates proficiency in recognizing opportunities, mobilizing resources, and taking effective action in various contexts. This assessment is based on the EntreComp framework, a comprehensive tool developed by the European Commission to promote entrepreneurship education and training. EntreComp offers a common reference framework that defines the key competencies necessary for entrepreneurial behavior and mindset.\nWe use the EntrepComp framework to help people build skills along six dimensions:\n\n1.3. Character Strengths \nCharacter strengths are invaluable tools that guide us in developing skills and enhancing our effectiveness in any endeavor. Leveraging these strengths makes learning new things more accessible and enjoyable. In Bloom programs, we use the Values in Action (VIA) Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their “Signature Strengths.” These strengths appear naturally and authentically, providing energy rather than requiring effort. Using our Signature Strengths promotes well-being and vitality in the workplace, leading to greater engagement and productivity. The VIA assessment analyzes virtues and values across cultures, identifying 24 universally recognized character strengths. These strengths are clustered into six core virtues:\n\nWisdom and Knowledge: Creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective, and innovation. These strengths enable us to gain and use knowledge effectively.\nCourage: Bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality, and zest. These strengths help us face challenges and pursue goals despite obstacles.\nHumanity: Love, kindness, and social intelligence. These strengths foster meaningful and supportive relationships with others.\nJustice: Citizenship, fairness, and leadership. These strengths contribute to a just and equitable community.\nTemperance: Forgiveness and mercy, humility, prudence, and self-control. These strengths help us regulate our behaviors and emotions.\nTranscendence: Appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, and spirituality. These strengths connect us to something greater and provide a sense of purpose and meaning.\nBy identifying and using our Signature Strengths, we can bring energy and positivity to our work, fostering a thriving and productive environment. This approach to personal development ensures that individuals achieve professional success and lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.\n1.4. Universal Skills.  \nUniversal Skills are competencies that benefit individuals across all organizational sectors and roles. These skills are critical to our personal development framework, ensuring team members can thrive regardless of their specific personal or professional requirements. Our approach to developing Universal Skills is guided by the Universal Skills Framework from SkillsBuilder.org, which categorizes these skills into four key dimensions:\nCommunication: Enhancing the ability to convey ideas clearly and effectively fostering better understanding and collaboration.\nProblem Solving: Equipping individuals to analyze situations, identify challenges, and develop practical solutions, thereby improving decision-making and innovation.\nSelf-Management: Developing personal discipline, time management, and resilience to navigate complex tasks and maintain productivity under pressure.\nTeamwork: Cultivating the skills necessary for effective collaboration, including empathy, cooperation, and working harmoniously in diverse teams.\nFocusing on these four dimensions ensures that our team members are equipped with versatile skills applicable in any context. This development approach enhances individual performance and contributes to our organization's overall effectiveness and adaptability. Using the Universal Skills Framework, we provide structured and targeted training that supports continuous personal and professional growth, ensuring that our teams are well-prepared to meet the demands of the modern workplace.\nHow To Apply the Individual Development Framework:  \nRequest your participants to take the Bloom Individual Development assessments on the Bloom Platform, which include Universal Skills, Well-being and Engagement, and Character Strengths.\nIn program cycles, discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers can help participants identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from their knowledge, online resources, or the Bloom Library of Activities. \nFor Character Strengths:\nAfter the individuals take the Character Strengths assessments, you can request individuals and teams to identify their Signature Strengths.\nOnce they’ve identified their Signature Strengths, request individuals to select a priority area within their Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills results on the Bloom Learn tab.\nEnd-of-program assessments help participants and program managers see growth and chart paths for further improvement.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Bloom Personal Framework involves critical skills and values that help you be effective as a person.\nIt includes Well-being & Engagement, Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills, Character Strengths and Universal Skills.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nUniversal Skills – Bloom\nWellbeing and Motivation – Bloom\nCharacter Strengths – Bloom\n\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nThe Skills Builder Partnership\nPermah Survey Home - The PERMAH Wellbeing Survey\nVIA Character Strengths Survey & Character Reports | VIA Institute\n\nPillar 2: The Organization\nBloom recommends the following organizational development assessment:\nThe Organizational Development Assessment is a way to assess your enterprise’s organizational status and needs quickly. Teams use it as a self-assessment tool, a guided collaborative process, or program managers can do third-party assessments.\n2.1. Organizational Development  \nOrganizational Capacity is the ability of an organization to achieve its mission while anticipating and managing future changes and risks. Our Organizational Capacity Assessment is derived from established methodologies by international consulting firms, tailored specifically for enterprises and accelerators. Bloom’s Organizational Capacities assessment helps organizations identify blind spots, providing a 360-degree perspective on their current state and guiding them in selecting development areas that will have the most impact. We offer adapted versions of the assessment for enterprises, early-stage enterprises, and accelerators.\nThe Organizational Capacity Assessment categories are:\n\n🎯 Strategy\n📲 Products and Services\n💶 Revenues, Financial Management & Sustainability\n🫶🏽 Corporate Social Responsibility\n🤝 Community Engagement & Communication\n🧑 Team, Leadership, Staff & Volunteers\n👨‍🏫 Innovation & Learning\n🧑🏽‍⚖️ Legal & Compliance\n⚠️ Infrastructure, Risk, Security & Resilience\n\nWhy a Self-Assessment?\nSelf-assessments provide rich information about organizational capacity and inform performance monitoring plans. They are primarily tools for capacity strengthening rather than performance evaluation. A critical aspect of a participatory assessment is fostering a safe space where staff can freely discuss an enterprise’s issues and priorities without fear of consequences when highlighting organizational weaknesses, challenges, and needs for improvement. In summary, self-assessment is a self-diagnosis process where an enterprise reflects on its performance, identifies priorities and goals, and sets a path toward achieving benchmarks. An Enterprise Capacity Assessment supports organizational decision-making and ownership of the capacity development process.\nResults Debrief and Analysis\nThe purpose of this step is to analyze the results with the assessment group so the enterprise can digest and understand the results and compare its current capacity against its longer-term goals. The presentation and discussion of results should be non-judgmental and positive. \nSuggested Steps:\nOpen the session and welcome everyone \nExplain the purpose of this meeting.\nReiterate that all results are indicators rather than performance assessments and encourage continued active participation\nDiscuss and analyze the results\nDiscuss each category with questions such as\nWhat is your reaction to these results? Are there any surprises?\nWhat are your observations about the enterprise’s overall capacity in this category?\nAre the scores for each indicator polarized or consistent with each other? Why?\nWhat is the enterprise doing well? What can the enterprise learn from success in this area?\nSummarize the discussion by highlighting the most surprising results or eliciting the most significant difference in opinion. \nReflect on the assessment results\nAsk the participants to discuss the following questions::\nWhat are our most important issues or weaknesses as an enterprise?\nWhat is causing these issues?\nIdentify key capacity issues revealed during the assessment.\nLook for root causes of issues, not just symptoms.\nIdentify issues common to multiple capacity areas.\nPriority Setting and Action Planning\nThis step helps the enterprise prioritize the issues identified during the assessment for inclusion in the Organization's Development Plan. \nSuggested Steps:\nLink the problems identified with the objectives\nStart with a discussion using these prompts\nDo you think any of the issues identified are more critical than others? Why?\nWhich categories or sub-categories would foster the most significant change in bringing the enterprise closer to its vision and goals?\nAsk the participants to vote on which objective they consider priorities over the next cycle and which should be in the Organization's Development Plan.\nExplain that the number of categories or subcategories to include depends on the time to implement the plan, the complexity of activities, and the resources required. Encourage the group to be pragmatic. \nIdentify key results and significant initiatives for each objective.\nWhat relevant milestones would your enterprise expect to achieve within the program timeframe?\nHow To Apply the Organizational Development Framework:  \nThe program manager invites teams and participants to take the relevant Organization Capacities assessment on the Bloom platform (Enterprise Capacities or Accelerator Capacities). \nAfter participants take the assessment, they are requested to go over their results and discuss with their team, mentor, and program manager to select their priority areas of development and the particular objectives they would like to achieve during the program. \nThe Organization Development Plan is documented using Bloom’s template for the duration of the program and is a shared document between the teams, the mentors, and the program manager. \nRegular progress check-ins during program cycles help the team, mentors, and program managers stay on track, adjust where needed, solve problems, and track progress.\nTeams periodically take the assessment (whole or just for their priority development areas) to celebrate growth and improvements!\n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Bloom framework's second pillar is organizational development. It includes the “doing” work of a person, team, or organization and the skills that help a team flourish. \nIt includes the ​​CAT (Capacity Assessment Tool) system, with specific assessments using categories and questions adapted to the needs of teams and programs. ]]]\n\nCan you help me come up with a personal contract that a participant will write to themselves to commit to following the program and agreeing to themselves that they are \"the kind of person who\" understands and commits to the holistic integration of a person growing personally and professionally and will commit to taking actions for their Leadership Growth(Defined by the ENL) as wll as their Enterprise growth (as defined by the ECAT) while simultaneously recognizing that their flourishing is foundational to being able to do the above two, and thus focusing on their wellbeing (as defined by the PERMAH) score, and to keep in mind that \"don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes them come alive because the world needs people who have come alive\" and that the Character Strengths assessment can help them find a way of being that might \"enliven\" everything else they do, developing their wellbeing, leadership and enterprise capacities. \n\nsummarize the challenge, write out the main themes and concepts needed to conduct the work to produce the \"auto-contract\", write a first draft and then and ask me 5 questions to help you improve the \"auto-contract\" that a user will sign for themselves ",

We recommend they only write what they'd like to share with a facilitator publicly, although the contract should mainly be a templated document they're reading to comprehend the process, and to understand why we ask them for wellbeing measures and that we expect them to reflect and devleop along these dimensions.

Below are ways to make that form both **data-rich** and **personally motivating**:\n\n1. **Use Clear, Simple Columns**  \n   - **Column A**: Priority Area (e.g., “Relationships” for Well-Being, “Creative Problem-Solving” for Leadership, “Financial Sustainability” for Enterprise).  \n   - **Column B**: Progress Rating (+ / – / 0).  \n   - **Column C**: A brief reflection (one or two lines, e.g., “Doing better with connecting to friends, I feel more supported!”).  \n   - **Column D**: Request for Help (optional but encouraged, e.g., “Need resources on setting up QuickBooks” or “Want a peer to brainstorm with”).\n\n2. **Prompt Specific Reflections**  \n   - Encourage a quick check-in on **what’s going well**, **what’s challenging**, and **where you need support**.  \n   - This short structure prompts people to celebrate wins, address obstacles early, and clarify exactly what help they want.\n\n3. **Include a “Self-Coaching” Question**  \n   - At each two-week interval, ask: “**What’s one thing I can start/stop/continue doing to strengthen this area?**”  \n   - This helps participants move from reflection to actionable next steps.\n\n4. **Automate Data Tracking if Possible**  \n   - If you’re using a Google Sheet, consider **conditional formatting** (e.g., plus sign = green, minus sign = red, etc.) for quick visual scanning.  \n   - Over time, participants (and facilitators) can see patterns—e.g., consistently neutral or negative ratings may flag areas where deeper intervention is needed.\n\n5. **Keep It Convenient**  \n   - Encourage participants to spend just a few minutes doing this every two weeks. This short, routine check-in is **key to habit-building**.  \n   - Reinforce that **less can be more** if it’s done consistently and candidly.\n\nBy combining a **concise auto-contract** (that participants sign to acknowledge the holistic nature of the program) with **a user-friendly bi-weekly form**, you create a structured yet flexible system. This not only **gathers robust data** but also helps participants see and feel their progress, ultimately leading to a stronger sense of engagement and accountability.",

      "content": "### **Review of Your Contract: Pros, Cons, and Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n#### **Pros (5 Strengths of the Contract)**\n1. **Holistic and Integrated Approach**  \n   - The contract does an excellent job of emphasizing how **personal well-being, leadership, and enterprise growth** are interconnected, reinforcing the whole-system approach.  \n\n2. **Encourages Self-Reflection and Ownership**  \n   - The commitment to **self-awareness, tracking progress, and regular reflection** makes the contract more than just a pledge—it sets up a habit of self-assessment and growth.  \n\n3. **Balances Personal & Community Responsibility**  \n   - It integrates **both individual development and contribution to the community**, ensuring participants recognize that their growth is linked to the success of others.  \n\n4. **Acknowledges Personal Boundaries**  \n   - The section on **sharing openly when comfortable** is a great addition, allowing participants to engage without feeling pressured to disclose personal information they aren’t ready to share.  \n\n5. **Encourages Actionable Development**  \n   - The structure of committing to one area in each dimension (Well-being, Leadership, Enterprise) **helps participants focus** on tangible, incremental improvements rather than broad, overwhelming goals.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Cons (5 Areas for Improvement)**\n1. **Too Many Repetitive Commitments**  \n   - Several sections restate similar ideas (e.g., \"I commit to…\" in almost every paragraph). This could be streamlined for clarity and impact.  \n\n2. **Lack of Clear, Measurable Accountability**  \n   - While participants commit to development, there are **no specific timeframes or action checkpoints** (besides the bi-weekly reflection). Adding a **concrete example of a commitment format** could help.  \n\n3. **Some Phrasing is Abstract Rather Than Practical**  \n   - Phrases like **“bring the authentic best of me to my project”** or **“working holistically to develop the mindset, skills, habits, capacities, and awareness”** are inspiring but vague. More **specific guidance** would make these easier to internalize.  \n\n4. **The “Whole System” Approach is Not Tied to Actions**  \n   - The idea of the body/mind/heart analogy is great, but how does that **translate into action**? A short statement about what this looks like in practice (e.g., balancing different skill development) would reinforce the point.  \n\n5. **Ending Feels Open-Ended Rather Than Motivating**  \n   - The closing lines (“at least, while acknowledging that growth is lifelong”) **soften the impact of the commitment**. A more inspiring or empowering final statement would make the pledge more compelling.  \n\n---\n\n### **Five Specific Changes for Improvement**\n\n#### **1. Streamline Repetitive Commitments**  \n💡 **Change This:**  \n> \"I commit to identifying and developing one of the Well-being and Engagement areas using the Bloom platform assessments and activities.\"  \n> \"I commit to identifying and practicing to help me develop along one of the Entrepreneurship & Leadership skills areas.\"\n\n✅ **To This:**  \n> \"I will use the Bloom assessments to choose one area to develop in Well-being, Leadership, and Enterprise Growth and take concrete steps to improve each one.\"  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Add a Simple “Accountability Check” Format**  \n💡 **Change This:**  \n> \"I will reflect on my well-being, leadership, and enterprise capacity progress every two weeks.\"\n\n✅ **To This:**  \n> \"Every two weeks, I will rate my progress in Well-being, Leadership, and Enterprise as Positive (+), Neutral (0), or Negative (-) and note one key action I took in each.\"  \n\n_(This makes reflection **structured and useful** while reinforcing the program’s feedback mechanism.)_  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Clarify the “Whole System” Concept with a Practical Example**  \n💡 **Change This:**  \n> \"The body is one system, and our mind and heart need to work together. Similarly, I value and commit to working holistically to develop the mindset, skills, habits, capacities, and awareness it takes to be successful every step of the way.\"\n\n✅ **To This:**  \n> \"Just like exercising different muscle groups strengthens the whole body, I will work on different areas of growth (Well-being, Leadership, and Enterprise) to support my success as a whole.\"  \n\n_(This keeps the analogy while making it **practical and actionable**.)_  \n\n---\n\n#### **4. Make the “Sharing Openly” Section More Direct & Reassuring**  \n💡 **Change This:**  \n> \"I will only share what I feel comfortable sharing with my mentors and program managers. I will keep a private record of personal growth for my awareness and tracking.\"\n\n✅ **To This:**  \n> \"I will use this document to track my progress. I will share what feels relevant with my mentor and facilitators and keep private notes for my own growth.\"  \n\n_(This keeps it friendly and **reduces friction** for participants who may be hesitant to share.)_  \n\n---\n\n#### **5. Strengthen the Final Commitment Statement**  \n💡 **Change This:**  \n> \"I will honor this commitment for the entire duration of the accelerator, at least, while acknowledging that growth is lifelong.\"\n\n✅ **To This:**  \n> \"I commit to this journey, knowing that small, consistent steps lead to big transformations. Growth is lifelong, and I will fully engage in this opportunity to build the future I envision.\"  \n\n_(This makes the ending **stronger and more inspiring**, rather than an open-ended “at least” statement.)_  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**  \nYour contract is already strong—it emphasizes the right values and integrates personal, leadership, and enterprise growth well. These changes will:  \n- **Make it more concise** (removing redundant phrasing)  \n- **Strengthen the structure** (clearer reflection process & accountability)  \n- **Make commitments more practical** (connecting concepts to real actions)  \n- **Ensure participants feel ownership** while keeping a light-touch accountability mechanism  \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts—are there areas you'd like to focus on even more? 🚀",
