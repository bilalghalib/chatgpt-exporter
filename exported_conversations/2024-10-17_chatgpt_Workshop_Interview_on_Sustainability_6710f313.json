Let's start with **Empathy and Story Gathering**. \n\nAsk your partner open-ended questions to explore their experiences related to sustainable housing, air conditioning, or green building retrofitting. Focus on understanding their emotions, motivations, and any challenges they’ve faced. \n\nSome examples of questions you could ask:\n- \"What has been your experience living in or around sustainable buildings?\"\n- \"How does air conditioning affect your daily life, especially in terms of comfort and energy use?\"\n- \"Have you ever thought about retrofitting a building to be more sustainable? If so, what motivated you?\"\n\nFeel free to dive deep into their story and take note of any interesting or emotional details. Let me know how it goes!",

How does it affect your day?\"\n- \"What specific challenges do you face with using the generator?
