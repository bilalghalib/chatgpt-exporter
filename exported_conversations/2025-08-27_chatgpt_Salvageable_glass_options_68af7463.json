      "content": "I see your measuring glass — it’s cracked in multiple places, including a long fracture down the side and a large chip at the rim.  \n\nHere’s the situation:  \n\n- **Not food safe anymore**: Because the crack goes through the rim and side, even if glued, it could harbor bacteria and release glass shards. Using it for food or liquids would be unsafe.  \n- **Repair option**: You *could* glue it with a strong clear epoxy or UV glass glue if you want to repurpose it for a **non-food use** (like holding pens, brushes, or as a small planter).  \n- **Disposal**: If you don’t have another use for it, it’s best to carefully wrap and dispose of it as glass waste to avoid injury.  \n\n👉 In short: **not salvageable for kitchen use**, but you can recycle or repurpose it for something non-edible.  \n\nWould you like me to give you safe step-by-step instructions for repairing it with epoxy if you want to keep it for another use?",

      "content": "Good thinking — food-safe silicone is flexible and non-toxic once cured, so in theory it *could* seal cracks. But there are a few important caveats for your broken glass:  \n\n### Why it’s tricky\n- **Structural weakness**: Your glass has a big chip at the rim and a long fracture line. Silicone can seal, but it won’t restore the original strength. A knock, hot/cold change, or even gentle washing could cause it to split again.  \n- **Hygiene**: Even with silicone covering, microscopic gaps along the crack can trap food or liquid. That makes it very hard to keep 100% sanitary.  \n- **Durability**: Silicone peels more easily from smooth glass surfaces, especially under hot water or dish soap.  \n\n### Where it *can* work\n- If you **really like the cup** and want to reuse it, you could:  \n  - Clean and dry the crack thoroughly.  \n  - Apply a thin bead of **food-safe, high-temperature silicone** (sold for aquariums or kitchen sealing).  \n  - Smooth it over the crack *on the outside only* (to avoid direct food contact).  \n  - Let it cure fully (usually 24–48h).  \n\nIt might be fine for **cold, non-acidic things** (like dry ingredients, sugar, flour), but **I wouldn’t trust it for liquids** or anything hot/acidic (coffee, vinegar, lemon, etc.).  \n\n👉 My honest recommendation: if you want a **functional kitchen vessel**, it’s better to replace it. If you want to **salvage it sentimentally**, silicone could make it safe enough for dry storage or non-food use.  \n\nWould you like me to suggest the best specific types/brands of food-safe silicone you could get in France (since I see you’re there)?",
