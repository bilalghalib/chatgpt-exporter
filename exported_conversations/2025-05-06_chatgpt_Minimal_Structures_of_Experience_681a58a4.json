We ask: Is there something so minimal, so foundational, that all traditions can acknowledge it—not as agreement, but as a place to begin?\n\nOur dialogue tested and critiqued various candidate foundations (e.g., “experience,” “happening,” “difference”) and found that even these were often too ontologically loaded.\n\nThus, this research does not seek immediate synthesis, but rather a shared contact zone before assumptions form—a space of inquiry that precedes belief, self, culture, or value.\n\n⸻\n\nObjectives\n\t•\tIdentify possible pre-conceptual structures or features of experience that are accessible to all worldviews.\n\t•\tExamine how different traditions treat the beginning of knowing or being.\n\t•\tDevelop tools for cross-paradigm philosophical dialogue that avoid premature metaphysical claims.\n\n⸻\n\nMethodologies\n\t•\tTextual analysis across traditions: Buddhist, Islamic/Sufi, Taoist, Indigenous, Western philosophical, and scientific.\n\t•\tFirst-person phenomenological interviews and bracketing practices, with diverse participants.\n\t•\tDesign of “epistemic handshake” experiments: Can people from divergent worldviews agree on anything without invoking their frameworks?\n\t•\tField conversations: Gathered from interfaith circles, indigenous elders, and scientific thinkers.\n\n⸻\n\nExpected Outcomes\n\t•\tA shared philosophical vocabulary for pre-conceptual experience.\n\t•\tA typology of starting assumptions across worldviews.\n\t•\tFrameworks for epistemic humility and pluralistic dialogue.\n\t•\tSeeds for further inquiry into value, ethics, and meaning from a deeper starting point.\n",

      "content": "Below is one possible “first‑pass” answer to your brief.  I treat it as a **proposal sketch** rather than a finished thesis, so you can still poke holes in it, swap pieces out, or tighten the framing to suit funders / collaborators.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Candidate Minimal Structures of Experience  \nThe aim is to list elements that show *up* in every lived moment, yet do not presuppose any doctrine about *what* they are.\n\n| Label (working term) | Very short gloss | Why it’s plausibly worldview‑agnostic |\n|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Immediacy (“this‑ness”)** | A felt “something is happening *now*.” | Prior to naming, judging, or theorizing, there is simply a present eventing. |\n| **Affective Valence** | The moment tilts pleasant / unpleasant / neutral. | Every tradition acknowledges feeling‑tone; none requires an ontology to notice it. |\n| **Directional Attention** | Awareness can narrow, widen, rest, or shift. | All participants can report where attention “is,” irrespective of metaphysics. |\n| **Embodied Situatedness** | A proprioceptive sense of position, breath, gravity. | Even disembodied cosmologies arise from someone who can describe breath or posture. |\n| **Relational Openness** | A tacit sense that other presences *could* respond. | Allows land‑relations, social relations, or analytic observer/observed without privileging any. |\n| **Temporal Flow** | A before / during / after that can speed, slow, or stop. | Found equally in Zen kōan time, Indigenous seasonal time, and Western clock time. |\n\nThese six, together, constitute an *experiential scaffold* that seems unavoidable yet as thin as we know how to make it.  None forces a stance on matter vs. spirit, self vs. no‑self, etc.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. How the Three Broad Traditions Touch the Scaffold\n\n| Scaffold item | Rationalist (e.g., analytic philosophy / cog‑sci) | Contemplative (e.g., Buddhism, Daoism) | Indigenous (diverse; e.g., Anishinaabe) |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Immediacy     | “Sense data,” “raw feels,” Husserl’s *hyle*       | *Tathātā* (thus‑ness)                  | “All my relations” presently alive      |\n| Valence       | Hedonic tone, utility signal                      | *Vedanā*                               | Emotional weather tied to land/story    |\n| Attention     | Spotlight model, predictive coding priors         | *Samādhi*, mindfulness of mind         | Listening as reciprocal responsibility  |\n| Embodiment    | Merleau‑Ponty, enactive cognition                 | Body‑scan, *qi* flow                   | “Walking as the land walking”           |\n| Relational    | Game theory, joint intentionality                 | Compassion, *inter‑being*              | Protocols of respect with human/non‑    |\n| Temporality   | Linear arrow, entropy                             | Moment‑to‑moment impermanence          | Cyclical ceremonial time                |\n\nSeeing the same elements named differently starts the “epistemic handshake”: *We are looking at one structure through three lenses.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Experimental/Field Components\n\n1. **Micro‑Phenomenology Interviews (Petitmengin)**\n   * Train interviewers from each worldview to bracket doctrinal language.\n   * Ask participants to describe a fresh, mundane moment (e.g., “the first sip of water today”).\n   * Code transcripts for the six scaffold items; compare inter‑coder reliability.\n\n2. **Dyadic “Nothing‑But” Dialogue**\n   * Pair participants from divergent worldviews with the rule:  \n     “Describe only what you can verify in direct present experience; if a doctrinal term slips in, partner says ‘source?’ and the speaker re‑anchors in experience.”\n   * Outcome measure: number of mutual nods vs. confusions; qualitative feeling of being understood.\n\n3. **Indigenous Sharing Circles with Embedded Scientist**\n   * Begin with land acknowledgement and ceremonial protocol.\n   * A neutral facilitator periodically surfaces scaffold items (“What are we noticing about time right now?”).\n   * Record shifts in language—does empirical or spiritual jargon retreat?\n\n4. **Minimal‑Assumption VR Encounter**\n   * Place participants into a bare‑bones virtual room that only changes brightness, tone, and movement speed.\n   * Ask them to jointly annotate what “is happening” without naming *why*.\n   * Logs allow quantitative clustering of descriptions across cultures.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Analytical Framework\n\n* **Triangulation** – Converging textual exegesis, interview coding, and experiment outcomes.  \n* **Grounded Theory** – Let categories emerge; test whether they reduce back to the six scaffold items.  \n* **Mutual “Erring”** – Borrowing V. Descombes: track *where* each worldview feels the others err, then step back one layer earlier.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Expected Deliverables\n\n1. **Glossary of Proto‑Terms** – Immediacy, Valence, etc., each with culture‑specific synonyms and illustrative quotes.  \n2. **Typology of Starting Moves** – e.g., Rationalist: “detach & model,” Contemplative: “observe & release,” Indigenous: “relate & reciprocate.”  \n3. **Handbook for Epistemic Humility Workshops** – 1‑day and 3‑day formats, including the dyadic dialogue script and circle protocols.  \n4. **Scholarly Article** – Target *Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences* or *Journal of Global Ethics*.  \n5. **Open‑Access Dataset** – De‑identified interview excerpts tagged by scaffold element.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Anticipated Critiques & Mitigations\n\n| Critique | Response |\n|----------|----------|\n| “Your scaffold still smuggles in Western phenomenology.” | Encode critiques as additional audit trail; invite co‑authors from each tradition to revise labels or add missing elements. |\n| “Indigenous knowledges are not ‘minimal’ but relationally thick.” | Emphasize that ‘minimal’ is an *analytic lens*, not a prescription; output includes pathways back into thickness. |\n| “Language already shapes experience—impossibility of pre‑conceptual.” | Accept but bracket: study is about the *closest we can get* to that horizon, not a metaphysical guarantee. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Next Steps\n\n1. **Pilot‑test two micro‑phenomenology interviews (one cross‑cultural pair).**  \n2. **Secure ethical clearance**, especially around Indigenous data sovereignty (OCAP principles).  \n3. **Seek partner institutions** – a contemplative studies center, an Indigenous university program, and a cognitive‑science lab.  \n4. **Apply for seed funding** (Templeton “Epistemology & Spirituality” RFP closes July 15).  \n\n---\n\n### Closing Thought  \n\nIf genuine dialogue starts not with “What do you believe?” but with “What is undeniably happening *right now* for you?”, then mapping that terrain—even if thin, fragile, and partially ineffable—may give our plural world exactly enough footing to keep talking.",
