  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user worked on revising Section 11 of a sustainability plan for a Training of Trainers (ToT) program focused on green housing in Mosul, Iraq. They had completed initial ToT cohorts in September-October 2025 training 39 people across solar, insulation, and architecture modules. The user wanted to align this section with their authentic vision rather than having it sound overly prescriptive or consultant-like. They emphasized wanting humble, soft-spoken language that reflects their belief in organic community emergence over engineered structures.\n\nThe user provided feedback forms from participants, solar job placement data, and expert interview insights to inform the revision. Key themes emerged: connecting with Mosul Space's existing \"Climate Space\" monthly gatherings rather than creating parallel structures, recognizing natural leadership without formal hierarchies, exploring government subsidy advocacy for insulation materials, and creating minimal digital infrastructure for trainer directories with quality assurance. The user specifically wanted to remove detailed financial break-even analyses, tone down elaborate festival planning, and focus on possibilities rather than prescriptions.\n\nThrough the revision process, the user clarified their continuing role interests: conducting expert interviews, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which they find enjoyable), and building digital infrastructure. They emphasized the principle \"actions by their intentions\" - that this work is motivated by service to rebuild Mosul, reduce energy poverty, and protect the environment, not just employment. The user requested adding a strategic overview table comparing different sustainability approaches and wanted all AI writing giveaways removed (bold text, checkmarks, verbose language, excessive hedging phrases like \"it's worth noting\" or \"significantly\").\n\nThe final document presents a hybrid approach connecting organic community building through existing Climate Space gatherings with institutional anchors like universities, while exploring funding possibilities from employer sponsorship, university partnerships, and potential government subsidy expansion. The user's authentic voice comes through in the emphasis on trusting emergence over engineering sustainability through elaborate frameworks.",

            "extracted_content": "11) Sustainability Plan: Long-Term Capacity Building\n11.1 Vision for Continuity\nThe ToT sessions (Sept-Oct 2025) represent the beginning, not the end of a green housing training ecosystem in Mosul. This sustainability plan ensures that:\n\nTrainers continue to teach future cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, and Baghdad\nKnowledge is preserved and updated based on market feedback and new technologies\nThe community of practice thrives beyond project timelines\nFinancial models support ongoing delivery without indefinite donor dependence\n\nGuiding Principle (from discussion with trainers):\n\n\"Actions by their intentions\" — This work is framed as an act of service and worship, not just a job. Trainers are motivated by the desire to help Mosul rebuild, reduce energy poverty, and protect the environment. Sustainability mechanisms must honor this intrinsic motivation while providing practical support.\n11.2 Master Trainer Identification & Cascade Model\nSelecting Master Trainers\nFrom the 39 trainers who attended ToT sessions, we will identify 5-7 \"master trainers\" who demonstrate:\n\nHigh technical competence (assessment scores, peer recognition)\nStrong facilitation skills (observed during ToT sessions)\nCommitment to the mission (expressed willingness to host trainees, participate in follow-up)\nInstitutional anchors (university faculty, company owners who can scale training)\n\nPreliminary Candidates (based on ToT participation, group scoring between Bilal Ghalib and Salih Mahmod from the ITC,  and feedback):\n\nName\nModule\nStrengths\nInstitutional Anchor\nDr. Abdulhakim Nabel\nSolar\nUniversity of Mosul faculty; academic credibility\nUniversity of Mosul\nHossam Al-Deen Khalil\nSolar\nCompany owner (Aqtab Al-Taqa); practical experience\nPrivate sector (solar installation)\nOmar Laith\nInsulation\nArchitect; passionate about hands-on learning\nAl-Rafedyen Architects\nWifaq Ahmed\nInsulation / Architecture\nHeritage expertise; government subsidy insight\nMosul Heritage Foundation\nSaad Salih Dhiab\nInsulation\nUniversity faculty; willing to host field visits\nAl-Noor University\nYamama Salih\nArchitecture\nJunior architect; strong design portfolio\nAl-Rafedyen Architects\nAnfal Yathrib\nArchitecture\nInterior design; tech-savvy (social media)\nTurquoise Office\n\n\nMaster Trainer Role: Lead future ToT sessions (with IP support), mentor new trainers, update curriculum based on field experience, participate in bi-annual reviews.\n\n\n11.3 Financial Sustainability Model\nCost Per Cohort (based on Oct 2025 ToT)\nLine Item\nCost (IQD)\nNotes\nTrainer stipends\n600,000\n6 trainers × 100,000 IQD (3 days)\nVenue & catering\n400,000\nMosul Space facilities, tea/lunch\nMaterials\n200,000\nPrinted guides, hands-on supplies\nCoordination\n300,000\nIP staff time (pre-session prep, logistics)\nTOTAL per 3-day ToT\n1,500,000 IQD\n~$1,050 USD for 15-20 trainers\n\n\nCost per trainer: 75,000 - 100,000 IQD (~$50-70 USD)\n\nRevenue / Funding Options\nThe ToT model can be sustained through multiple funding streams:\n\nFunding Source\nMechanism\nViability\nNotes\nParticipant fees\nTrainers pay 50,000 IQD to attend ToT (covers materials)\nMedium\nWorks if trainers see clear ROI (certification → job opportunities)\nEmployer-sponsored\nSolar companies sponsor trainers (e.g., send 2 staff to ToT)\nHigh\nAlready happening informally - companies sent employees to Oct ToT, can it be beneficial enough for them in finding new quality team-members and growing awareness and the market for their services?\nUniversity partnerships\nUniversity of Mosul, Al-Noor University embed ToT into continuing education\nHigh\nDr. Abdulhakim, Saad Salih expressed interest\nDonor-funded cohorts\nUNDP, GIZ, grant search/writing\nHigh\nProven model; donors value youth/green employment\nGovernment subsidy\nIraqi Ministry of Education / Ministry of Environment fund green skills training?\nMedium-Low\nWifaq's insight: government subsidizes construction materials; could expand to training\n\nThis is the ability of the projects is also partially connected to the strength and the development of the community and the simplest processes that can be sustained with a mutually synergistic method might support the project long-term, so essentially building a community that will sustain the community because it's really mutually beneficial for everybody and so we can do that by having a sort of roundtable discussions and maybe also connecting with the already grassroots active project at Musler space called climate space and bridging with that program can make it so that we can have a sustainability process that doesn't require outside funding and is authentic and indigenous and truly providing value for those that attend we may be able to cultivate and kickstart that by having some of our initiatives, supporting and promoting already existing locally initiatives\nBreak-Even Analysis\nScenario 1: Donor-Funded\nCost: 1,500,000 IQD per cohort\nRevenue: 0 (fully subsidized)\nSustainability: Lasts as long as donor funding continues (2-3 years typical)\n\nScenario 2: Employer-Sponsored\nCost: 1,500,000 IQD per cohort\nRevenue: 10 companies × 2 trainers × 50,000 IQD = 1,000,000 IQD\nGap: 500,000 IQD (IP covers coordination, venue)\nSustainability: IP operational budget can absorb 500k/cohort (2-3 cohorts/year = 1.5M/year, manageable)\n\nScenario 3: University Partnership\nCost: 1,000,000 IQD (university provides venue, reduces catering costs)\nRevenue: 20 trainers × 50,000 IQD participant fee = 1,000,000 IQD\nGap: 0 (break-even!)\nSustainability: Highly sustainable if marketed as professional certification\n\nTarget for 2027: Achieve Scenario 3 (break-even via university partnership + participant fees) to ensure ToT can continue indefinitely.\n\n\n11.4 Community of Practice Mechanisms\nSustainability isn't just financial — it's about keeping the community engaged between formal trainings.\nWhatsApp Community Groups\nPurpose: Homework assignments, supplier photos, quick Q&A, peer support\nCadence: Daily activity during training cohorts; weekly check-ins between cohorts\nContent shared:\n\"I just visited this supplier — here's their pricing for EPS insulation\"\n\"Client asked about payback period — how do I calculate with rising tariffs?\"\n\"Check out this retrofit project I completed — before/after photos\"\nModeration: 1-2 master trainers + IP coordinator keep discussions focused\n\nCurrent Status: Active WhatsApp groups already exist for Solar (25 members) and Insulation (14 members) cohorts. Merge into single \"Green Housing Trainers - Iraq\" group to foster cross-module learning.\n\n\nBi-Annual Trainer Gatherings\nFrequency: Twice per year (May & November)\nFormat: 1-day convening (not full ToT, but refresher + strategy session)\nAgenda:\nMorning: \"How are trainings going?\" (trainers share successes, challenges)\nAfternoon: Curriculum updates (new materials, new techniques, feedback from participants)\nEvening: Social / networking (build relationships, celebrate impact)\nHost: Leverage Mosul Space's \"Climate Space\" existing convening power (they already host quarterly green business events)\n\nCost: 500,000 IQD per gathering (venue, tea, light refreshments) × 2/year = 1,000,000 IQD/year (~$700 USD, absorbable by IP budget)\n\n\nMonthly Reunion (Post-Training Cohorts)\nTiming: 30 days after each training cohort completes\nPurpose: Check-in on real-world implementation\nSolar: \"Did you complete an installation? Show photos!\"\nInsulation: \"Did you assess a home? Calculate savings?\"\nArchitecture: \"Did you present a green design to a client? How did they react?\"\nFormat: 2-hour session (in-person or Zoom)\nFirst hour: Show & tell (participants share portfolio pieces)\nSecond hour: Problem-solving clinic (troubleshoot challenges)\nOutcome: Builds accountability, surfaces curriculum gaps, creates social proof (\"If they can do it, so can I\")\n\nIntegration with Apprenticeships: This monthly reunion is when trainees present portfolio pieces to potential employers (see Section 9.2 Framework).\n\n\n11.5 Institutional Anchors\nTo avoid \"hero-dependent\" sustainability (where everything collapses if one person leaves), we anchor the ToT model to institutions:\n\nAnchor 1: University of Mosul (Academic Credibility)\nPartner: Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel (Solar expert, university faculty)\nRole: Embed ToT into university's continuing education program\nBenefits:\nUniversity branding attracts participants (certification valued)\nAccess to university facilities (classrooms, labs) reduces venue costs\nFaculty stability (universities outlast projects)\nNext Step: Draft MoU by Dec 2025 (IP + University of Mosul)\n\nAnchor 2: Mosul Space Organization (Community Convening Power)\nRole: Host ToT sessions, manage WhatsApp groups, coordinate logistics\nExisting Capacity: Mosul Space already runs \"Climate Space\" (quarterly green business events), so green housing ToT fits naturally\nSustainability: Mosul Space has diverse funding (not dependent on one donor), ensuring continuity\n\n\nAnchor 3: Iraqi Engineering Union (Professional Certification)\nRole: Recognize ToT certification as professional development credit for engineers\nBenefits: Engineers need continuing education credits to maintain licensure — ToT can fulfill this requirement\nNext Step: Explore partnership with Engineering Union via ITC contacts (Lada coordinates)\n\n\n11.6 Scaling Strategy: From Mosul to National\nPhase 1 (2025): Mosul Pilot ✅ COMPLETE\n39 trainers across Solar, Insulation, Architecture\n3 ToT sessions delivered (Sept, Oct 2025)\n\nPhase 2 (2026): Expansion to Anbar & Baghdad\nMaster trainers from Mosul lead ToT sessions in other governorates\nLocal partners identified (universities, NGOs) to host\nCurriculum adapted based on regional differences (e.g., Baghdad has different energy tariffs, climate)\nTarget: 60 additional trainers (20 per governorate)\n\nPhase 3 (2027-2028): National Certification Program\nFormalize certification: \"ITC Certified Green Housing Trainer\" recognized nationally\nAccreditation: Partner with Ministry of Education or Iraqi Engineering Union for official recognition\nTrain-the-Trainer cascade: Original 39 Mosul trainers become regional ToT leaders\nTarget: 200+ trainers nationwide\n\nKey Principle: \"One clear message per day\" — Keep ToT structure simple and replicable so new trainers can deliver it confidently.\n\n11.7 Green Home Festival / Fair (FLAGSHIP RECOMMENDATION)\n\nConcept\nBring together trainers, participants, suppliers, employers, policymakers, homeowners for a 1-day showcase event that:\nRaises awareness about green housing solutions\nShowcases trainee portfolios (before/after photos, ROI calculations, design competition winners)\nConnects trainees with employers (jobs fair component)\nFacilitates matchmaking (mentors ↔ cofounders, suppliers ↔ installers, clients ↔ consultants)\nCelebrates success (awards for best retrofit, most innovative design, community impact)\n\nTiming & Integration\n\nPiggyback on existing BEIT events to minimize costs:\n3.2 Design Competition Finale (200 houses, retrofit product startup, model homes) — happening in 2026\nGreen Home Festival becomes the showcase event for design competition winners + ToT graduate portfolios\nBudget: Add 2-3M IQD (~$1,400-2,000 USD) to existing 3.2 event budget (vs. 10M+ IQD for standalone event)\n\nAgenda (Draft)\n9:00 AM - Registration & Expo Setup\n  - Suppliers set up booths (SIKA, SMTC, solar companies)\n  - Trainers/trainees set up portfolio displays\n\n10:00 AM - Opening Ceremony\n  - ITC, Mosul Space, University of Mosul remarks\n  - Video montage: Before/after transformations from training cohorts\n\n11:00 AM - Showcase Session 1: Solar Installations\n  - 3-4 trainees present portfolio pieces (5 min each)\n  - Employers in attendance signal interest (live matchmaking)\n\n12:00 PM - Showcase Session 2: Insulation Retrofits\n  - 3-4 entrepreneurs present case studies (ROI achieved, client testimonials)\n\n1:00 PM - Lunch & Networking (Expo Hall Open)\n  - Speed networking: trainees ↔ employers, 5-min rotations\n\n2:00 PM - Design Competition Finale (Architecture Module)\n  - Top 3 designs presented (judges: Wifaq Ahmed, Yamama Salih, Dr. Omar)\n  - Audience votes for \"People's Choice Award\"\n\n3:00 PM - Panel Discussion: \"Scaling Green Housing in Iraq\"\n  - Panelists: Government official, university dean, private sector rep, trainer, trainee\n  - Topics: Subsidy expansion, market barriers, policy recommendations\n\n4:00 PM - Awards & Closing\n  - Best Solar Portfolio, Best Retrofit Impact, Best Heritage-Informed Design\n  - Announce: Next ToT cohorts (Anbar, Baghdad), apprenticeship opportunities\n\n5:00 PM - Optional: Site Visit to Model Home (if 3.2 has built one)\nExpected Outcomes\nVisibility: 200+ attendees (trainers, trainees, employers, policymakers, media)\nJobs: 10-15 trainees matched with employers during event\nAwareness: Social media coverage (each trainee shares photos → 100 trainees × 200 followers = 20,000 reach)\nPolicy momentum: Government officials see market demand → consider subsidy expansion\nCommunity cohesion: \"We're not just isolated trainers — we're part of a movement\"\n\nRecommendation: Allocate budget in 2026 planning; coordinate with 3.2 design competition lead.\n\n\n11.8 Digital Community Hub (Future Vision)\nConcept\nEvolve the Google Drive materials repository into a digital community hub that serves as:\nTrainer Directory: Profiles with credentials, contact info, specializations \"Need a solar trainer in Anbar? Here are 5 certified trainers with reviews.\"\nParticipant Portfolio Gallery: Showcase trainee work (before/after photos, testimonials) \"Employers: Browse portfolios, hire certified green housing professionals.\"\nSupplier Database: Pricing, specs, contact info for vetted suppliers \"Where can I buy EPS insulation in Mosul? Here are 3 suppliers with datasheets.\"\nQueryable Knowledge Base (RAG System): AI-powered Q&A \"What's the ROI for roof insulation in a 150m² home?\" → system retrieves data from trainer interviews, case studies\nEvent Calendar: Upcoming ToTs, monthly reunions, Green Home Festival\n\nPhase 1 (2026): Simple Directory (Low-Tech)\nPlatform: Airtable or Google Sheets (accessible, no coding required)\nContent: Trainer profiles, participant portfolios (PDF exports), supplier list\nAccess: Public (to maximize visibility), or login-required (if privacy needed)\n\nPhase 2 (2027): Interactive Hub (Medium-Tech)\nPlatform: Custom website (WordPress + database)\nFeatures: Search/filter trainers by module, location; submit portfolio; request mentorship\nMaintenance: Mosul Space designates 1 staff member as \"community manager\" (5-10 hrs/week)\n\nPhase 3 (2028+): AI-Powered Knowledge Base (High-Tech)\nPlatform: RAG system (Retrieval Augmented Generation) powered by Claude or GPT\nData sources: All trainer interview transcripts, ToT materials, participant feedback, case studies\nUse cases:\nTrainers: \"What am I teaching on Day 2?\" → retrieves agenda + key message\nParticipants: \"How do I calculate U-value for this wall?\" → retrieves equation + worked example\nM&E: \"How many interviews did Bilal conduct?\" → retrieves data from project database\n\nBudget Estimate:\nPhase 1 (Directory): $0 (Airtable free tier)\nPhase 2 (Website): $500-1,000 USD (domain, hosting, basic design)\nPhase 3 (RAG): $2,000-5,000 USD (API costs, developer time) — could be separate grant proposal\n\nNote: RAG system is beyond current contract scope, but positioned as \"future enhancement\" to demonstrate innovation and attract follow-on funding.\n\n\n11.9 Government Subsidy Advocacy (HIGH-IMPACT LEVERAGE POINT)\nThe Opportunity (from Wifaq Ahmed, Mosul Heritage Foundation)\n\"The Iraqi government already has a subsidy program for construction materials — homeowners can get money back when they buy cement, rebar, etc. We should advocate to expand this subsidy to include insulation materials (EPS, XPS, mineral wool, reflective barriers).\"\n\nWhy This Matters:\nCurrent barrier: Insulation perceived as \"luxury\" (not essential like cement)\nSubsidy changes economics: If government covers 30-50% of insulation cost, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years → mass adoption\nPrecedent exists: Government already subsidizes construction materials, so expansion is politically feasible (not creating new program, just adding items to existing list)\n\nAdvocacy Strategy\nDocument the case (by Dec 2025):\nCompile ToT participant case studies showing ROI of insulation (energy savings, health benefits, comfort)\nCalculate: \"If government subsidized insulation, X households could afford it → Y jobs created → Z reduction in generator fuel imports\"\n\nIdentify decision-makers:\nMinistry of Construction & Housing (manages subsidy program)\nMinistry of Environment (climate, energy efficiency mandate)\nPrime Minister's Office (economic recovery, youth employment)\n\nBuild coalition:\nUniversity of Mosul (academic credibility)\nIraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement)\nPrivate sector (suppliers like SIKA, SMTC benefit → lobby support)\nITC (international reputation, economic development expertise)\n\nPilot demonstration (2026):\nRetrofit 10-20 homes with insulation (funded by ITC/UNDP)\nDocument before/after energy bills, homeowner testimonials, thermal imaging\nHost government officials for site visit at Green Home Festival\n\nPolicy brief submission (2026):\nITC submits formal recommendation to Ministry of Construction\nKey message: \"Subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience — achievable by adding 5 items to existing subsidy list\"\n\nTimeline: 2-3 years (advocacy is slow), but if successful → transformational impact on market demand for insulation → more jobs for BEIT trainees.\n\nITC Role: Leverage relationships with government (existing from other ITC Iraq projects), provide technical analysis, coordinate coalition.\n\n\n11.10 Continuous Improvement: Feedback Loops\nSustainability requires ongoing adaptation based on what's working in the field.\nFeedback Mechanisms\nPost-Training Surveys (1 week after ToT) \"What worked? What needs improvement? Are you ready to train?\"\nMonthly Reunion Check-Ins (30 days post-training) \"Did you deliver your first training session? What challenges did you face? What resources do you need?\"\nBi-Annual Curriculum Review (May & Nov gatherings) \"What new materials/techniques should we add? What's outdated? What are participants asking about that we didn't cover?\"\nEmployer Feedback (from apprenticeship partners) \"Are trainees showing up with the skills we need? What's missing?\"\nParticipant Feedback (from training cohorts taught by ToT graduates) \"How was the training? Did the trainer explain clearly? What would you change?\"\n\nCurriculum Update Process: \nExample: If multiple trainers report \"Participants struggle with U-value calculations\", then:\nUpdate: Add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems\nPilot: Test in next Anbar ToT cohort\nAssess: Did it help? If yes → keep; if no → iterate\n\n\n11.11 Summary: 5-Year Sustainability Roadmap\nYear\nMilestones\nFunding Model\nCommunity Mechanisms\n2025\n✅ Mosul ToT pilot (39 trainers)\n✅ Apprenticeship framework launched\n✅ Master trainers identified\nDonor-funded (ITC)\nWhatsApp groups, monthly reunions\n2026\n• Anbar & Baghdad ToT (60 trainers)\n• Green Home Festival (pilot)\n• University MoU signed\n• Subsidy advocacy begins\nEmployer-sponsored + donor hybrid\nBi-annual gatherings, Climate Space integration\n2027\n• Break-even ToT model (participant fees + university)\n• National certification program\n• 200 trainers nationwide\nUniversity partnership (self-sustaining)\nDigital Community Hub (Phase 2), RAG pilot\n2028\n• Government subsidy expansion (if advocacy succeeds)\n• ToT embedded in university curriculum\n• RAG system fully operational\nSelf-sustaining (fees + government)\nContinuous curriculum updates, alumni network\n2029+\n• Regional expansion (Kurdistan, Basra)\n• Train-the-trainer cascade (master trainers train new ToT facilitators)\nScaled, diversified funding\nNational green housing community of practice\n\n\n"

They've just added a paragraph (the long run-on sentence starting with \"This is the ability of the projects...\") and they want me to:\n\n1. Review section 11\n2. Review the paragraph they just added\n3. Look at our past conversations to understand what they really believe\n4. Ask questions to help align the section with their authentic vision\n5. Then update the document\n\nThe user seems to feel that the current section 11 is too prescriptive, proposing too many things that may not align with their actual vision. They want something more authentic that reflects their real beliefs and values.\n\nLet me first search our past conversations to understand their perspective better.I'll help you align Section 11 with your authentic vision. Let me first search our past conversations to understand your thinking better.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood, I found some relevant past conversations. Let me search for more specific content about the user's approach to sustainability and community building.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood, I'm getting a clearer picture. Let me search for more about the user's views on organic development, community, and authentic vs. prescriptive approaches.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nNow I'm getting a much better picture of the user's thinking. Let me read the document they uploaded and then formulate questions based on what I've learned about their values:\n\nKey themes I'm seeing:\n1. Natural emergence over prescriptive planning\n2. Organic community building that serves life\n3. Indigenous/authentic approaches vs. imposed systems\n4. Simplicity and beauty over complexity\n5. Mutually beneficial relationships\n6. Distrust of metrics-driven/growth-focused models\n7. Value of direct relationship and experience\n8. Importance of integration with existing local initiatives (Climate Space)\n9. Letting things self-sustain through genuine mutual benefit\n\nThe paragraph they wrote is trying to express this but it's a run-on sentence. They want Section 11 to reflect their actual beliefs rather than being full of prescriptive recommendations and proposals that may not align with their values.\n\nLet me view the document to see what's in Section 11.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nAh, I see now. This uploaded document isn't the actual Section 11 - it's the beginning of our conversation history where the user was asking me to help them with their report. The actual Section 11 is in the document they provided in the <documents> tag at the beginning of this conversation.\n\nLet me re-read that document carefully, particularly Section 11, and then formulate good questions based on what I learned about their values from the conversation search.Now I understand the situation better. Looking at Section 11 and your new paragraph, plus what I know about your values from our past conversations, I can see the tension.\n\n**Here's what I'm noticing:**\n\nSection 11 currently reads like a **consulting deliverable** - lots of structures, frameworks, budgets, phases, timelines. It's comprehensive but feels prescriptive and externally-imposed rather than organically emerging.\n\nYour new paragraph is trying to say something more like: *\"The real sustainability comes from building genuine community where people actually want to show up because it serves them, not because we've created elaborate structures.\"*\n\n**Questions to help align Section 11 with what you actually believe:**\n\n1. **The Climate Space connection**: You mention bridging with the existing Climate Space at Mosul Space. What's actually happening there now? What makes it work without all these elaborate frameworks? What would it look like to simply *extend* what's already working rather than building parallel structures?\n\n2. **Mutually beneficial vs. structured**: The document proposes master trainers, bi-annual gatherings, monthly reunions, certification programs, etc. But what if sustainability just looked like: \"People keep meeting because they're getting real value\"? What's the *minimum viable* structure that allows genuine mutual benefit to emerge?\n\n3. **Indigenous and authentic**: You wrote \"authentic and indigenous and truly providing value.\" What does indigenous sustainability look like in Mosul's context? Not the word \"indigenous\" in an abstract sense, but: What are the natural patterns of how knowledge already spreads there? How do communities already self-organize? What are you working *with* rather than imposing?\n\n4. **The festival**: Section 11.7 proposes an elaborate Green Home Festival. But is that really aligned with organic community building? Or is it more consultant-speak? If you were just following what wants to happen naturally, what would emerge instead?\n\n5. **Financial sustainability**: The document has detailed break-even analyses, revenue scenarios, cost-per-cohort calculations. But you've said before that putting metrics first often kills the life of something. What if sustainability isn't about break-even math but about: \"Is this actually serving people enough that they'll figure out how to keep it going\"?\n\n6. **Your actual role going forward**: What do YOU want your relationship to this community to be? The document implies ongoing coordination, updates, management. But is that authentic to you? Or would you rather create conditions for emergence and then step back?\n\n**The core tension I'm sensing:**\n\nThe document treats sustainability as something to *engineer* through correct structures. But you seem to believe sustainability emerges when something is *genuinely alive* - when it serves real needs so well that people naturally keep it going.\n\nWhich frame feels true to you? And if it's the second one, what would Section 11 look like if it trusted emergence more than structure?",

Identify local processes to integrate within (Climat Space at Mosul Space) to encourage ongoing education campaigns and community engagement are essential for fostering a sustainability mindset and ensuring the success of reconstruction efforts.\n* Design green space excursions as part of the training curriculum to provide hands-on learning opportunities. Use the “city as a school”\n\nAssistant:  The sustainability meeting in Mosul yielded a wealth of innovative and thoughtful recommendations for developing an effective curriculum tailored to the local context. Participants emphasized the importance of creating a comprehensive, engaging, and accessible training program that would not only impart technical knowledge but also foster a lasting sustainability mindset among diverse groups of learners. The suggested approaches reflect a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities present in Mosul, combining modern educational techniques with community-driven initiatives. These recommendations aim to create a dynamic learning environment that extends beyond traditional classroom settings, leveraging the city itself as a living laboratory for sustainable practices. The following points outline the key curriculum recommendations that emerged from the session:</chat_conversation></chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/03136dd8-c4a2-48a5-9eb1-c3ecc7655136' updated_at=2024-08-29T09:56:50.938489+00:00>Rebuilding Mosul's Future with Youth and Innovation\nKey features of Mosul's traditional architecture include:\n- Use of local materials with high thermal mass\n- Design elements for natural ventilation and cooling\n- Water conservation and management systems\n\nThese time-tested methods provide valuable insights for modern sustainable construction practices.\n\n## Youth Innovation\n\nOne of the most inspiring aspects of Mosul's journey towards sustainability is the involvement of its youth. Young people, even at the middle school level, are developing impressive sustainable solutions:\n\n1. Solar-powered water distillers\n2. Walking-powered cellphone chargers based on energy harvesting principles\n3. Smart home temperature control devices\n\nThese innovations demonstrate not only technical skill but also a deep understanding of local needs and resources.\n\n## The BEIT Project\n\nThe Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project plays a crucial role in Mosul's sustainable development. This European Union-funded initiative aims to generate quality jobs by enhancing the housing and construction sector in Iraq.\n\nKey aspects of the BEIT project include:\n- Improving the business environment for local MSMEs\n- Promoting green and innovative practices\n- Strengthening partnerships between public and private stakeholders\n- Enhancing awareness of regulatory frameworks for investing in housing and construction\n\nThe project's focus on youth and women's empowerment aligns well with the innovative spirit observed in Mosul's younger generation.\n\n## Challenges and Opportunities\n\nWhile Mosul demonstrates great potential for sustainable development, it also faces significant challenges:\n\n1. The harsh climate necessitates innovative approaches to sustainable living and construction.\n2. Post-conflict reconstruction efforts may prioritize speed over sustainability.\n3. Integrating modern green technologies with traditional practices requires careful balance.\n\nHowever, these challenges also present opportunities for Mosul to become a leader in sustainable urban development in challenging environments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMosul's journey towards sustainability is a powerful example of how a city can leverage its cultural heritage, empower its youth, and embrace innovation to build a more sustainable future. The insights gained from Mosul's experience have the potential to inform sustainable development practices not just in Iraq, but around the world.\n\nThe BEIT project, by focusing on inclusive growth and sustainable practices, promises to play a crucial role in unlocking the potential of Mosul's youth, MSMEs, and innovative spirit. By combining the best of Mosul's heritage with modern sustainable technologies, the city is poised to create a brighter, more sustainable future for itself and serve as an inspiring example for other cities facing similar challenges.\n</antArtifact>\n\nThis draft report incorporates the key points you mentioned, including the insights from Dr.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/4138f6d4-ac97-4688-871c-cda551b8cb1f' updated_at=2024-08-15T09:45:50.938509+00:00>Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup in Mosul\n<chat_conversation>Title: Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup in Mosul\n\nHuman: I need to write a one pager explaining the collaboration between the International Trade Center and Mosul Space to send to Mosul Space - explaining the Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup we want to host there on the 21st  \nWelcoming a broad spectrum of stakeholders in Mosul to a session sharing insights, best practices, and activities.  \n\nAsk me 5 questions to help you help me write this one pager. It should also contain a draft invitation letter that Mosul Space can use to send to the community to invite people from universities, businesses, youth, and politicians/regulatory people\n\nAssistant:  To help you create an effective one-pager and draft invitation letter, I'll need some more information. Here are five questions to guide our process:\n\n1. What specific objectives does the International Trade Center have for this collaboration with Mosul Space?\n\n2. Can you provide more details about the \"Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup\"? What are the main topics or themes to be discussed?\n\n3. Are there any particular achievements or ongoing projects from either organization that should be highlighted in the one-pager?\n\n4. What is the expected format of the meetup (e.g., presentations, panel discussions, workshops), and how long will it last?\n\n5. Are there any specific outcomes or actions you hope will result from this meetup?\n\nOnce you provide answers to these questions, I'll be better equipped to help you craft a comprehensive one-pager and draft invitation letter tailored to your needs.\n\nHuman: The hope is to gather the ecosystem, to see who's there, what projects are happening, what challenges are being faced, and to build community. It's also a way to learn more about what skills/competencies might be needed to strengthen in the community. \nWe will be asking people to present a 5-10 min short impromptu presentation on their research/projects/business/legistation and how they are connected to the concept of sustainable reconstruction and ask them what their dream is, what's going well, and what they need/and or are blocked. Maybe we need to come up with the questions they can answer so it's clear/easy and people don't get frozen, I might need help here, ideas?\n1. I'll include the BEIT project document as a pdf here so you can get an overview of what it is, as well as a document explaining the needs \n2. Informal presentations with live note taking highlighting relationships/commonalities\n3.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/03136dd8-c4a2-48a5-9eb1-c3ecc7655136' updated_at=2024-08-29T09:56:50.938489+00:00>Rebuilding Mosul's Future with Youth and Innovation\nThe BEIT project, by focusing on inclusive growth and sustainable practices, promises to play a crucial role in unlocking the potential of Mosul's youth, MSMEs, and innovative spirit.

I asked for definitions. I created confusion in my life and compounded that confusion for years.\n\nI see the same pattern in our work at Bloom:\n- Fear of failure makes us draw hockey stick charts instead of facing reality\n- Fear of looking unprofessional makes us create unnecessary metrics\n- Fear of losing funding makes us pretend to be what we're not\n- Fear of uncertainty makes us build platforms no one needs\n\nIt's like we're all playing a game of \"looking good\" instead of doing good. We're afraid to say \"I don't know\" or \"let's try something different\" or \"maybe we built the wrong thing.\" So we keep pushing ahead with systems and metrics that don't serve life.\n\n## Indigenous Economics Reimagined\n\nWhen I talk about indigenous economics, I'm not suggesting we all need to take their principles directly. We need to discover these principles ourselves in our own indigeneity - our Lebanese indigenous economics - emerging from systems built by people who have reintegrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic and the eyes of meaning and quality.\n\nThis means:\n- Cyclical time: Understanding success happens in every moment, not just at exit\n- Seven generations thinking: Building for real sustainability, not quick wins\n- Relationship with meaning: Seeing resources as living participants, not just materials\n- Local wisdom: Trusting community knowledge over abstract metrics\n\nLook at traditional craft villages - they sustained communities for generations without:\n- Growth projections\n- Efficiency metrics\n- Resource optimization\n- Scale strategies\n\nInstead they focused on:\n- Direct relationships\n- Quality transmission\n- Community vitality\n- Natural sustainability\n\n## Making Measurement Serve Life\n\nHere's what this could look like practically at Bloom:\n\nInstead of measuring:\n1. Platform engagement\n- Daily active users\n- Time on site\n- Feature adoption\n- User journey metrics\n\n2. Growth metrics\n- Month-over-month growth\n- Market penetration\n- Scale factors\n- Revenue projections\n\n3. Impact numbers\n- People reached\n- Resources deployed\n- Problems \"solved\"\n- Efficiency gains\n\nWe could measure:\n1. Quality Recognition\n- Moments of meaningful insight\n- Quality of decision making\n- Depth of understanding\n- Natural wisdom emergence\n\n2. Relationship Depth\n- Authentic connections formed\n- Knowledge transmission quality\n- Community formation patterns\n- Trust development\n\n3. Living Impact\n- Real transformation stories\n- Community vitality signs\n- Cultural preservation\n- Natural sustainability patterns\n\nThe key isn't just changing what we measure, but how we measure:\n- Through direct relationship not just data\n- Through story not just metrics\n- Through observation not just tracking\n- Through community not just systems\n\n## A Different Kind of Economy\n\nThis isn't about rejecting markets or metrics entirely. It's about putting them in service of life rather than the other way around.</chat>",

Although these variables are within the Iraqi government standards, they can still influence the odor generation potential and the efficiency of biological treatment processes.\n\n### Table 1: Contaminant Odor Impact Assessment\n| Contaminant                         | Average Concentration | Odor Impact | Remarks                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)              | TBD                  | High        | Major contributor to \"rotten egg\" smell, prevalent in sulfide-rich wastewater |\n| Ammonia (NH3)                       | TBD                  | Moderate    | Causes sharp, pungent odors; often present in human waste                     |\n| Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)   | TBD                  | Varies      | Can include a range of organic chemicals with varying odor profiles           |\n\n### Table 2: Comparison of Aerobic Treatment Technologies\n| Technology         | Efficacy in Reducing Sulfides/Ammonia | Ease of Maintenance | Self-Sustaining Aspects                                           |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Activated Sludge   | High                                  | Moderate            | Requires constant aeration but can be energy-efficient           |\n| Biofiltration      | High                                  | High                | Natural process; requires periodic media replacement             |\n| Aeration Systems   | High                                  | Moderate            | Effective in odor control; requires energy input                 |\n\n### Table 3: Cost Comparison of Odor Control Technologies\n| Technology                 | Capital Cost | Operating Cost | Maintenance Cost |\n|----------------------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Biofiltration              | Moderate     | Low            | Low              |\n| Chemical Scrubbers         | High         | High           | Moderate         |\n| Activated Carbon Filters   | Moderate     | Moderate       | Moderate         |\n| Aeration Optimization      | Low          | Moderate       | Low              |\n| pH Control                 | Low          | Low            | Low              |\n\n## 3.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/db359a7a-c17e-4767-89d3-cb0841417ad1' updated_at=2025-01-08T08:52:02.515694+00:00>Authentic Growth Through Daily Reflection\nCommunity Building\n- Identify 2-3 local partners\n- Create simple maintenance agreements\n- Set up harvest sharing system\n\n3.

This is actually kinda connected to something that I remember. When I was in Michigan, I had keys to the hackerspace I helped found. I had keys to the robotics studio I was a cofounder of. I had keys to the neutral zone, which is a teen center in Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I was teaching screen printing, and I had keys to my parents' house, and I had keys to my house in downtown Ann Arbor. And I was running a screen fitting studio and a robot studio and I had a hacker space that I was a cofounder of and on the board of, and I just remember feeling like this is awesome. Like, I'm deeply integrated, deeply connected, and, like, this keys set of keys, the the the heft of it, the weight of it just felt awesome. And, like, whenever I would go back to Michigan, I would go to the hacker space, and I would feel happy to see my locker there even if I wasn't a member anymore. I'd left a long time ago. They kept it for me because it's like you know, one of the cofounders' lockers. And it had, like, all of the weird stuff and, like, materiality is really important to me. Like, I had uranium and giant neodymium magnets and fun chocolate project ideas and had memories there. And, like, I I love having that even if I didn't live there anymore. I would go back Android would be a part of it and see it. And when I go to Lebanon and I see this tree in the middle of the road that I love. I don't know why. And even at The university, the AUB in in Beirut, there's a tree that I was there with Josephine, and I saw the bark. And I remembered it's like, Joel, one day we'll be old and we'll have texture in our skin like this bark. And I just remember that moment and that Claude, and that place is special to me. You could say it's sacred or something. And yeah, I think there's something here that's really important and I think we can plant those trees\n\nAssistant:  **Deep Pattern Recognition - \"Sacred Anchors Pattern\"**\n\n**What's Emerging Here**\nA profound pattern about how you create belonging:\n\n1. **Physical Tokens of Connection**\n- The weight of keys\n- The uranium in your locker\n- Trees in specific places\n- Texture of bark\n\n2.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/c9fbce96-36c0-46fb-a3e8-477deb1f5eb1' updated_at=2025-01-14T21:01:34.023103+00:00>Balancing Intellectual and Family Priorities\nAlternative Economic Models:\n- Gift economy participation\n- Skill-sharing networks\n- Community-supported projects\n- Direct value exchange\n\n3.

For the check-in structure, should I:\n- Standardize the initial energy/emotions/priorities check-in\n- Make the rest of the flow more adaptive\n- Maintain the consistent closing format (insight + 3 questions + system note)\n- Remove prescriptive steps between opening and closing?\n\n3. About the technical elements, shall we:\n- Remove the submit_values_card function entirely\n- Keep the AP definitions but integrate them more naturally\n- Focus on how the LLM should notice and work with patterns\n- Simplify the technical structure while maintaining clarity?\n\n4. Regarding supports and growth, would you prefer:\n- More emphasis on guiding discovery through reflection\n- Less prescriptive support design\n- More focus on helping people see their own wisdom\n- Integration of pattern recognition without explicit frameworks?\n\n5.

They've provided several documents:\n     8\t\t1\tA ToT (Training of Trainers) Activity Report about an Insulation & Heritage-Informed Housing program in Mosul\n     9\t\t2\tAttendance sheets from the training\n    10\t\t3\tInterview summaries showing expert feedback\n    11\t\t4\tAn Internship/Apprenticeship/Job-Shadowing Framework document\n    12\tThey want me to help organize their thoughts by asking questions so they can express their ideas authentically rather than me just writing it for them. This is a great approach - I should act as a facilitator/interviewer to help them articulate their own experiences and insights.\n    13\tLooking at the documents, this seems to be about:\n    14\t\t•\tA training program in Mosul focused on insulation, solar energy, and heritage-informed housing\n    15\t\t•\tTraining of trainers (ToT) conducted October 12-14, 2025\n    16\t\t•\tExpert interviews about job placement for graduates\n    17\t\t•\tDevelopment of frameworks for practical learning\n    18\tI should ask open-ended questions that help them reflect on:\n    19\t\t•\tKey achievements and challenges\n    20\t\t•\tWhat they learned\n    21\t\t•\tImpact of the work\n    22\t\t•\tTheir role and contributions\n    23\t\t•\tFuture recommendations\n    24\t\t•\tPersonal growth\n    25\tLet me start with some foundational questions to understand their perspective and role better.\n    26\tI'd be happy to help you organize your thoughts and create an authentic report! Let me start by asking some questions to understand your perspective better.\n    27\tLet's start with the big picture:\n    28\t1. What was YOUR specific role in this project? Were you the lead trainer, coordinator, curriculum developer, or something else? I want to understand your vantage point.\n    29\t2. What was the most surprising thing that happened during the ToT (October 12-14)? Sometimes the unexpected moments tell us the most about what worked or what needs attention.\n    30\t3. Looking at the feedback where participants said things like \"too much information at once\" - what was going through your mind when you heard that? How did it make you feel, and what did you think should be done about it?\n    31\t4. The report emphasizes \"kWh-based reasoning\" and avoiding \"amps × IQD\" shortcuts. Why does this matter so much to you personally? There's clearly a strong conviction here - help me understand the story behind it.\n    32\tLet's start with these four, and based on your answers, I'll ask follow-up questions to help you articulate the narrative of your report. Take your time - the more specific and honest you are, the more authentic your report will be.\n    33\t\n    34\t\n    35\t\n    36\t\n    37\tRetry\n    38\tBG\n    39\tOkay. So my specific role was to design the curriculum and to Interview all of the experts and to extract their insights and to make a training program that will be able to guide Recent graduates technical experts into potentially 3 different tracks. 1 is the idea that Mosul really needs a cultural shift in understanding the importance of insulation and opening up this idea of, like, energy consulting as a field. And so there aren't people that go and kind of assess homes and, identify if efficiencies that are possible through retrofitting. And the International Trade Center is, you know, working to help people start businesses or develop, the the different sectors economy, and to do good at the same time. And so this opportunity came up to do that for the installation. And so each each, training has its own sort of sub goal. So the goal for installation is to, get people with some technical background To understand how to the different options and opportunities for retrofitting homes and increasing their value, I I think this is something we yeah, increasing their value and also decreasing their cost. Over the long term by reducing energy expenditures while also having a lot of other returns on investment from quality of life standards and health and all that. So that's so there's an element that needs to be about financial literacy. There's element that needs to be about Soft skills and sales, and there's an element that needs to be about awareness and making sure that the classes create these opportunities for exposing people to ideas and then there's an element of Technical skills and and learning how to do stuff. And so putting it all together, like, you go, you assess the house, you identify areas of intervention, and then you can actually implement them. And you also understand that that could be a business. And so we want them to develop that competence, over that training. The other trainings are different. So, for solar, it's a recognized field. There already are solar companies, providing the in Muleside, it's Pretty standardized, and we want to help grow the market by increasing the number of people who can do the work and also getting them ideas about how to sell it because a lot of the challenge with the solar market is that people don't think it's actually appropriate for MOSLEN, and they need to be convinced. And part of the reason why they're not convinced is that previous installers were using low quality materials leading to bad outcomes and, not the best ROI. And so the thing we're looking to do is to train recently graduated electrical engineers on, solar skills, along with a lot of the other Same skills, from the previous training in terms of sales and pitching and creating t o, return on investments and stuff like that. And, the last one is the, one about may not So the thing about the solar one, though, is that the the outcomes are gonna be different. We we don't actually Like them to be able to, start a business immediately. We kind of expect them to Join to join another person's team, because it's a bit of a challenge to So from scratch without having any, learning on another person's team. And so that's the idea is that they would join somebody else's team after getting knowledge. Of the the entire industry. And Yeah. And then Getting knowledge about the entire Industry practical experience, and then also helping them get their first portfolio pieces. So at the end, of the program is, we really expect them and hope that they will go and do an install And if they do an install, then we're gonna meet up a month after. And this kind of relates to the jobs part, which is we want to create, like, at least a little bit of a reunion, a meeting of all the 3 different modules and a connection to the, the overall, like, green business Ecosystem and Landscape. And so to do that, we wanted to, make an event out of it, and I think that can be a part of what we do with the jobs, element is Is the month after training We're gonna be bringing all the people together and then the last The training is architecture, and this is the one that connects to the how's the fiddler? How baby fiddler? It connects to the, last, training is the architecture And in the architecture one, our goals are slightly different. Because, it's sort of like the highest level overview one, actually. Have you reached out? And the thing that we want to do with the, architecture one is help people Remember, that before Mosul was destroyed, a lot of the architecture was actually quite appropriate. For the environment, and it's only modern architecture that really moves away from it for speed for cost, and for copying, the west. And so one of the main things that we're trying to do is make new things that are worth copying That are worth copying for mostly And, And so, we're working with junior architects who apparently all already believe And green, design. The challenge is that don't think their bosses also believe in it, but they just don't think that the market is ready for it. And so a lot of what we're doing in the architecture module is simply creating Awareness and Hi. Having people design things and share it on social media so that, you know, we're gonna be training a 100. I don't know how many people. And so if each of them is sharing, then we're creating a bit of, impact on the consciousness then And so we're talking about, like, looking back to leave forward, learning from the past, combining it with modern science, and, creating Sort of new designs And the goals are, 2. 1 is that, we have a normal, design for a real person. Like, we want our, organizing space, mussel space, the implementing partner to be able to find them real clients or they could actually, since they're all architects, they could all be getting clients from their workplace and then what we can do with them is, bring those clients and say, hey. Listen. We're gonna do just like a dentist does, like, a free job or something like that, we want them to do a, a job during class, that kind of Moores, there's some heritage and green architecture design creates, moments where they get to share it and also, makes it so that they are making social media and other outputs All of them will meet in a month the month Later for the installation and the solar is going to be Did you Get to install something. Did you take what you learned and actually implement it? The one for the in cell, architecture is gonna be a design competition. So the design competition for, model home where they all have the same standard. During class, everyone's gonna have a different standard because everyone's gonna clients They're gonna be talking to them. Learning emotional intelligence and pitching skills to try to really learn how to convince the person to go with their design. But, the final design project is gonna be their, They're gonna be their, All gonna have the same project. This is, the things that I got so far. I'll answer your other questions next. If you wanna add some more questions to the list, you can do that now. I'm just trying to get you as much background. I've been doing this for about a year now. I'm interviewing a lot of trainers. I have the transcripts from all my interviews. Will be helpful. But I I wanna do a good job with this final, product and submission. So what can I do to do that best? Ask all questions.\n    40\t\n    41\tShow more\n    42\t\n    43\t\n    44\t\n    45\tSynthesized three interconnected training tracks addressing Mosul's green economy transformation.\n    46\t\n    47\t\n    48\t10s\n    49\t\n    50\t\n    51\tWow, this is incredibly rich and detailed.

They've provided several documents:\\n\\t1\\tA ToT (Training of Trainers) Activity Report about an Insulation & Heritage-Informed Housing program in Mosul\\n\\t2\\tAttendance sheets from the training\\n\\t3\\tInterview summaries showing expert feedback\\n\\t4\\tAn Internship/Apprenticeship/Job-Shadowing Framework document\\nThey want me to help organize their thoughts by asking questions so they can express their ideas authentically rather than me just writing it for them. This is a great approach - I should act as a facilitator/interviewer to help them articulate their own experiences and insights.\\nLooking at the documents, this seems to be about:\\n\\t\\u2022\\tA training program in Mosul focused on insulation, solar energy, and heritage-informed housing\\n\\t\\u2022\\tTraining of trainers (ToT) conducted October 12-14, 2025\\n\\t\\u2022\\tExpert interviews about job placement for graduates\\n\\t\\u2022\\tDevelopment of frameworks for practical learning\\nI should ask open-ended questions that help them reflect on:\\n\\t\\u2022\\tKey achievements and challenges\\n\\t\\u2022\\tWhat they learned\\n\\t\\u2022\\tImpact of the work\\n\\t\\u2022\\tTheir role and contributions\\n\\t\\u2022\\tFuture recommendations\\n\\t\\u2022\\tPersonal growth\\nLet me start with some foundational questions to understand their perspective and role better.\\nI'd be happy to help you organize your thoughts and create an authentic report! Let me start by asking some questions to understand your perspective better.\\nLet's start with the big picture:\\n1. What was YOUR specific role in this project? Were you the lead trainer, coordinator, curriculum developer, or something else? I want to understand your vantage point.\\n2. What was the most surprising thing that happened during the ToT (October 12-14)? Sometimes the unexpected moments tell us the most about what worked or what needs attention.\\n3. Looking at the feedback where participants said things like \\\"too much information at once\\\" - what was going through your mind when you heard that? How did it make you feel, and what did you think should be done about it?\\n4. The report emphasizes \\\"kWh-based reasoning\\\" and avoiding \\\"amps \\u00d7 IQD\\\" shortcuts. Why does this matter so much to you personally? There's clearly a strong conviction here - help me understand the story behind it.\\nLet's start with these four, and based on your answers, I'll ask follow-up questions to help you articulate the narrative of your report. Take your time - the more specific and honest you are, the more authentic your report will be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRetry\\nBG\\nOkay. So my specific role was to design the curriculum and to Interview all of the experts and to extract their insights and to make a training program that will be able to guide Recent graduates technical experts into potentially 3 different tracks. 1 is the idea that Mosul really needs a cultural shift in understanding the importance of insulation and opening up this idea of, like, energy consulting as a field. And so there aren't people that go and kind of assess homes and, identify if efficiencies that are possible through retrofitting. And the International Trade Center is, you know, working to help people start businesses or develop, the the different sectors economy, and to do good at the same time. And so this opportunity came up to do that for the installation. And so each each, training has its own sort of sub goal. So the goal for installation is to, get people with some technical background To understand how to the different options and opportunities for retrofitting homes and increasing their value, I I think this is something we yeah, increasing their value and also decreasing their cost. Over the long term by reducing energy expenditures while also having a lot of other returns on investment from quality of life standards and health and all that. So that's so there's an element that needs to be about financial literacy. There's element that needs to be about Soft skills and sales, and there's an element that needs to be about awareness and making sure that the classes create these opportunities for exposing people to ideas and then there's an element of Technical skills and and learning how to do stuff. And so putting it all together, like, you go, you assess the house, you identify areas of intervention, and then you can actually implement them. And you also understand that that could be a business. And so we want them to develop that competence, over that training. The other trainings are different. So, for solar, it's a recognized field. There already are solar companies, providing the in Muleside, it's Pretty standardized, and we want to help grow the market by increasing the number of people who can do the work and also getting them ideas about how to sell it because a lot of the challenge with the solar market is that people don't think it's actually appropriate for MOSLEN, and they need to be convinced. And part of the reason why they're not convinced is that previous installers were using low quality materials leading to bad outcomes and, not the best ROI. And so the thing we're looking to do is to train recently graduated electrical engineers on, solar skills, along with a lot of the other Same skills, from the previous training in terms of sales and pitching and creating t o, return on investments and stuff like that. And, the last one is the, one about may not So the thing about the solar one, though, is that the the outcomes are gonna be different. We we don't actually Like them to be able to, start a business immediately. We kind of expect them to Join to join another person's team, because it's a bit of a challenge to So from scratch without having any, learning on another person's team. And so that's the idea is that they would join somebody else's team after getting knowledge. Of the the entire industry. And Yeah. And then Getting knowledge about the entire Industry practical experience, and then also helping them get their first portfolio pieces. So at the end, of the program is, we really expect them and hope that they will go and do an install And if they do an install, then we're gonna meet up a month after. And this kind of relates to the jobs part, which is we want to create, like, at least a little bit of a reunion, a meeting of all the 3 different modules and a connection to the, the overall, like, green business Ecosystem and Landscape. And so to do that, we wanted to, make an event out of it, and I think that can be a part of what we do with the jobs, element is Is the month after training We're gonna be bringing all the people together and then the last The training is architecture, and this is the one that connects to the how's the fiddler? How baby fiddler? It connects to the, last, training is the architecture And in the architecture one, our goals are slightly different. Because, it's sort of like the highest level overview one, actually. Have you reached out? And the thing that we want to do with the, architecture one is help people Remember, that before Mosul was destroyed, a lot of the architecture was actually quite appropriate. For the environment, and it's only modern architecture that really moves away from it for speed for cost, and for copying, the west. And so one of the main things that we're trying to do is make new things that are worth copying That are worth copying for mostly And, And so, we're working with junior architects who apparently all already believe And green, design. The challenge is that don't think their bosses also believe in it, but they just don't think that the market is ready for it. And so a lot of what we're doing in the architecture module is simply creating Awareness and Hi. Having people design things and share it on social media so that, you know, we're gonna be training a 100. I don't know how many people. And so if each of them is sharing, then we're creating a bit of, impact on the consciousness then And so we're talking about, like, looking back to leave forward, learning from the past, combining it with modern science, and, creating Sort of new designs And the goals are, 2. 1 is that, we have a normal, design for a real person. Like, we want our, organizing space, mussel space, the implementing partner to be able to find them real clients or they could actually, since they're all architects, they could all be getting clients from their workplace and then what we can do with them is, bring those clients and say, hey. Listen. We're gonna do just like a dentist does, like, a free job or something like that, we want them to do a, a job during class, that kind of Moores, there's some heritage and green architecture design creates, moments where they get to share it and also, makes it so that they are making social media and other outputs All of them will meet in a month the month Later for the installation and the solar is going to be Did you Get to install something. Did you take what you learned and actually implement it? The one for the in cell, architecture is gonna be a design competition. So the design competition for, model home where they all have the same standard. During class, everyone's gonna have a different standard because everyone's gonna clients They're gonna be talking to them. Learning emotional intelligence and pitching skills to try to really learn how to convince the person to go with their design. But, the final design project is gonna be their, They're gonna be their, All gonna have the same project. This is, the things that I got so far. I'll answer your other questions next. If you wanna add some more questions to the list, you can do that now. I'm just trying to get you as much background. I've been doing this for about a year now. I'm interviewing a lot of trainers. I have the transcripts from all my interviews. Will be helpful. But I I wanna do a good job with this final, product and submission. So what can I do to do that best? Ask all questions.\\n\\nShow more\\n\\n\\n\\nSynthesized three interconnected training tracks addressing Mosul's green economy transformation.\\n\\n\\n10s\\n\\n\\nWow, this is incredibly rich and detailed. The user has been deeply embedded in this project for a year, and there's so much genuine insight and passion here. Let me identify what I'm hearing:\\n\\t1\\tThree distinct tracks with different goals:\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tInsulation: Creating a NEW field (energy consulting/retrofitting) - entrepreneurial focus\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tSolar: Growing an EXISTING field - employment/apprenticeship focus\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tArchitecture: Cultural shift - awareness/design competition focus\\n\\t2\\tKey philosophical commitments:\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tLooking back to leap forward (heritage-informed design)\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tFinancial literacy + technical skills + soft skills = holistic training\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tQuality over quantity (avoiding the mistakes of previous low-quality solar installs)\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tMarket transformation through awareness and social proof\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tPractical application (not just theory)\\n\\t3\\tThe user's role: Curriculum designer + expert interviewer + synthesizer\\n\\t4\\tUnique challenges for Mosul context:\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tDestroyed heritage architecture\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tMarket skepticism (solar doesn't work here)\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tLow-quality previous work damaging trust\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tJunior staff believe but senior staff/market don't\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tNeed to rebuild cultural memory of what worked before\\n\\t5\\tThe reunion/competition structure is really clever - it creates accountability and community\\nNow I need to ask questions that will help them:\\n\\t\\u2022\\tExpress their personal journey and learning\\n\\t\\u2022\\tConnect the feedback to their design decisions\\n\\t\\u2022\\tArticulate what surprised them\\n\\t\\u2022\\tExplain the \\\"why\\\" behind key choices (like kWh vs amps \\u00d7 IQD)\\n\\t\\u2022\\tReflect on what worked and what needs adjustment\\nLet me craft questions that will draw out authentic voice and help structure the report.\\nThis is brilliant context - thank you. I can feel how much thought and care you've put into this. Now let me ask some questions that will help us capture YOUR voice and YOUR learning journey in this report:\\nOn the ToT experience itself:\\n5. You designed three very different outcomes (entrepreneur vs. employee vs. awareness/design). During the October ToT, did the trainers \\\"get\\\" why each module needed such a different approach? What resistance or confusion did you encounter, if any?\\n6. The report mentions participants asked for \\\"simple diagrams/decision trees to structure complex choices.\\\" Did you anticipate this need when you were designing the curriculum, or did it surprise you? What does this tell you about how engineers/architects learn differently than you expected?\\n7. You've been interviewing experts for a year. What's ONE insight from those interviews that fundamentally changed how you designed the training? (Give me a specific example - like \\\"Ali Sabah said X and that made me realize Y\\\")\\nOn the \\\"kWh not amps \\u00d7 IQD\\\" crusade:\\n8. When you were interviewing experts, did they ALSO make this mistake? Or is this something you observed trainers doing? Help me understand where this bad habit comes from and why it matters so much to you.\\n9. Think like a metaphor for a second: If \\\"amps \\u00d7 IQD\\\" is like [what?], then \\\"U-value \\u2192 kWh \\u2192 ROI\\\" is like [what?] (You said you like metaphors - give me one that captures why this shift matters)\\nOn heritage and \\\"looking back to leap forward\\\":\\n10. You said modern Mosul architecture \\\"copies the west for speed, for cost.\\\" What's the SPECIFIC heritage technique or design principle you most want these junior architects to remember and reinvent? (Like - is it courtyard design? Thermal mass? Wind towers? Something else?)\\n11. The ToT report mentions \\\"k\\u0101shi (tiles) vs concrete reflectivity\\\" came up explicitly. Why tiles? What's the story there?\\nOn what surprised you:\\n12. Reading through the ToT feedback and attendance sheets - what made you think \\\"YES, this is working\\\" and what made you think \\\"oh no, I need to adjust this\\\"?\\n13. You have Dr. Omar from University of Mosul involved. What did HE say during that October 14 stakeholder sync that either validated your approach or made you rethink something?\\nOn the job placement reality:\\n14. You've got these beautiful three tracks with different outcomes. But when you look at the Solar Job Placement feedback (like Zeina Tareq saying CVs aren't trusted, or Hossam suggesting the institution pays trainee salaries for 2 months) - did that match what you expected the market to be like? Were you surprised by how hard it is to place people?\\n15. The design competition + reunion structure is really smart. Whose idea was that, and what problem were you trying to solve with it?\\n\\nTake your time with these. Answer the ones that resonate most first - we don't have to go in order. The more specific stories and examples you give me, the more authentic and compelling your report will be.\\nAnd yes - if you have specific transcript excerpts from your expert interviews that were pivotal, absolutely share those. They'll be gold for the report.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRetry\\nBG\\nOkay. So 3 very different outcomes, entrepreneur, employee, awareness, design. And what do the trainers get why each module needs a different approach? Yeah. I I think they they do partially because all of the trainers are the ones that have derived all these insights from. So the people that were in the TOT were the people that I was talking to to learn all this stuff. Like, I I live in France. I have no idea. I had to fly to Iraq and call these people over and over. Until I finally started to understand what's going on? For the overall vision. Right? So maybe I should send you a bait like, overall vision of kind of launching the green housing Market, in Iraq or you know, making that more possible. Well, bringing in youth and women into the workplace and, yeah. So one of our main MNEs is the financial literacy components and, yeah. So that's why it's Like that. The report mentions participants simple diagram decision trees for complex choices Yeah. I guess the way that I anticipated it or what I was really thinking is, like, we have 5 days, you know, And so I don't want the complicated stuff. I think the complicated stuff has to be in the trainer's knowledge base in their mind, but, the participant we need to give him the larger context, say, but for you, learn how to do this one thing well. Especially, you know, for installation. There's like a a 1000000000 things you can do. Different layers, different materials, different compounds, But we wanted to give them the 80% 80 20. Right? So, like, you learn this few things, and you'll be dangerous in the market, and you can actually have a business. So that that was the idea. But, it was during the sessions that people kept saying, like, but what about this? But what about this? You know? And every like, it's, not always so straightforward. It's actually good to have all of these different trainers with their different opinions. And so one of the things that I'm trying to do is actually Make that trainer database visible. And so and queryable. So I'm I'm working on creating an r a g treatment. Augmented generation, project that will, let us get to, you know, if the the trainers have a question or even if the participants have a question, can actually ask that because, the all the trainer's mind. And maybe instead of just giving them the answer, we can say, hey. Like, if you can talk to this person, they would know the answer to your question best. And I think that that is actually something that I'm doing. It's a little bit beyond my contract. But, it's something that I thought was cool to do. I'm not sure if I'm just overdoing it, though. Okay. Let's see. What else? When you're interviewing experts, they also make this mistake. No. The experts you know, they they understand that the customer speaks in amps because they pay per amp by the generator company. But in the end, they need to do the math and all the calculations with the appropriate measures. Looking back to the forward, monsoyed copies the west. Specific heritage technique Yeah. I I think there's not exactly a specific heritage technique What I would like them to do is, learn the first principles because they think that the past is some, like, frozen thing that we're going to copy in a suddenly everything will be okay, it's not true. We need to be inspired by the principles, and some of them are are values based. They're not just, like, technical. Principles. For instance, a lot of roads are curved because it creates a sense of privacy. Right? You can't look so far and, like, gaze at people who are walking by. And other things. Yeah. So I think that would really be it. First of all, I'd like to appreciate that the past has something to teach us. And that, By instead of going to copying if and and just rushing into things, if we really connect with the things that make Mosul feel like home, We can build the homes of the future. And I actually like that kind of framing. And, everybody has memories of their grandparents' homes and places that they've been mostly that, like, surprisingly are great even in some of the hotter days or colder days even, because Mosul does have both. Cashy versus concrete reflectivity. Not sure why it's in the TOT report. Parts. Yeah. It doesn't seem so relevant for, like, the end of reporting. It seems like a technical thing. TOT feedback in attendance sheets Yeah. I don't know. Could you review the attendance sheets and feedback and tell me what you think? I think the thing that I was really excited about was just how engaged and active everyone was. You know? We were really Having a great discussion and I really felt like Amina, that they were really there to learn and grow, and that actually one of the really cool things is I feel like they were learning from each other and that just bringing them together made them feel like thing. You know, we talked about this community. I think that's actually really important. I These sealants don't meet each other. They all work at different companies and, do, different things even. And right now, the the engagement is just with each cohort individually. So installation trainers, solar trainers, and the well, we didn't actually complete the CEO t for the architecture. But these are, like, 3 Hey. 3 different trainers groups that can also be a part of a broader coalition of people working on, like, green and, efficient housing that Is useful for mostly And now let's see what else. Ahmad from the University of Molesale. Well, I guess I just really trust that he's gonna be able to do something cool. Because he's, the person who's taking forward the, activity for the TOT. And he has all of the right backgrounds and knowledge And, in a later message, I will send you our Interview. Together. I train him on the content. I think he appreciates the content, but I think he'll bring a lot to the table as well. Beautiful 3 tregs. Yes. Hold on. Jobs placement. CVs aren't trusted. Yeah. I think it's I I understand that. I know there's a lot of, like, people looking for jobs. And this is a part of the reason why I think We have to work on the market. As well as, the the job side. So, like, can give people skills, but if nobody wants those skills, it's gonna be a problem. This is why a big part of the training is this awareness campaign, and I think that might be something I recommend in the project. How important the awareness is, and all of the misconceptions think that's the big one. Like, there's just a lot of misconceptions about what will and what won't work. And we just need to get people to understand that, like, the stuff that you're saying doesn't work actually works. There's a lot more benefits than first meets the eye. And it's financial, and it's more than financial. So woo hoo. So I think the important element from the training is going to be to have the participants become advocates and the trainers to become advocates and to have them share and to do things that are Like, public. And this is why I was thinking of having the design competition and other things and and and maybe just to be Not so UN based NGO about it. Right? And just say, listen. Like, we know that, it Yeah. Prices for, gas are gonna rise. And oil, based on the the trends and, like, what the government, is doing. And so gonna become more expensive. And right now, we know that there way cheaper than they actually really should be. And that, it's horrible for our health, and we don't like the sound, and we don't like I'm the way our city looks, and we don't you know, we don't like these things. We don't want these things. There's other ways to do things And and also, like, the reason why all of the solar was bad is because people buying literally used batteries. Bad BMSs. You know? And installation. Like, people are skimping out because they can pocket some money if they use cheaper insulation. And just keep the rest. Right? From a government contract. And even though the government contract doesn't hardly include any, and there's, like, a huge gap here in terms of the government and and some people from the trainers, like, one of the biggest and exciting insights that I had was, that the government does sort of have subsidies for materials for construction, where they can say, hey. I bought this material they can get money back. And that sounds like a huge opportunity, and Wifert is the one who talked the told me that. So we really need to double down on how to also collaborate the governments and the whole system in a legit\\n\\nShow more\\n\\n\\n\\nSynthesized insights to craft targeted interview questions.\\n\\n\\n20s\\n\\n\\nThis is incredibly rich. Let me capture the key authentic insights and help organize them:\\n\\t1\\tOn trainer understanding: The trainers ARE the experts he interviewed - so they inherently get it because they co-created the insights. He had to fly from France to Iraq and do extensive interviews to understand the context.\\n\\t2\\tOn decision trees: He designed for the 80/20 rule - give participants the essentials to be \\\"dangerous in the market\\\" not everything. The complexity should be in trainers' heads, not overwhelming participants. But during sessions, the \\\"what about this?\\\" questions showed the need for clearer navigation.\\n\\t3\\tOn the RAG system: He's building something beyond his contract - a queryable trainer knowledge base so people can get answers or be connected to the right expert. This is authentic to his problem-solving approach.\\n\\t4\\tOn \\\"amps \\u00d7 IQD\\\": The experts DON'T make this mistake - they know customers speak in amps (because generators charge per amp) but do proper calculations. So this is about translating between customer language and technical reality.\\n\\t5\\tOn heritage: NOT about copying specific techniques but learning FIRST PRINCIPLES - both technical and values-based (like curved roads for privacy). The key insight: \\\"connect with things that make Mosul feel like home to build homes of the future.\\\" Everyone has memories of grandparents' homes that worked well.\\n\\t6\\tOn ToT success: What excited him most was how engaged everyone was and that they learned FROM EACH OTHER. The community building aspect - bringing together people who normally don't meet across companies/sectors.\\n\\t7\\tOn Dr. Omar: Trust and delegation - Omar has the right background and will bring his own value.\\n\\t8\\tOn job placement reality: He gets why CVs aren't trusted. The key insight: you can give people skills but if nobody wants those skills, it's a problem. This is why MARKET AWARENESS is crucial.\\n\\t9\\tOn misconceptions: This is huge - there are misconceptions about what works/doesn't work. The training needs to create ADVOCATES (both participants and trainers) who share publicly and challenge these misconceptions.\\nThe energy landscape reveals critical economic and environmental challenges. Current energy systems are unsustainable, with artificially low gas prices masking significant health and urban aesthetic problems. Previous solar initiatives failed due to poor infrastructure - used batteries, inadequate battery management systems, and contractors cutting corners with cheap materials. A breakthrough opportunity emerged through Wifaq, who highlighted government subsidies for construction materials - a potential game-changing leverage point for sustainable development.\\nOkay, this is GOLD. I'm starting to see your vision and voice clearly. Let me dig deeper on a few things that will make your report authentic and powerful:\\nOn the RAG system and trainer knowledge base:\\n16. You said you're building a queryable trainer database \\\"beyond your contract\\\" - what problem were you personally frustrated by that made you decide to build this? (This is the kind of authentic detail that makes a report real - when did you realize you needed this?)\\n17. If the RAG works, what's the dream scenario? Like - give me a concrete example: \\\"Participant asks [X question] and instead of [Y happening], now [Z happens]...\\\"\\nOn misconceptions and awareness:\\n18. You said \\\"there's a lot of misconceptions about what will and won't work.\\\" Give me the TOP 3 misconceptions you kept hearing over and over in your interviews. And what's the TRUTH that contradicts each one? (This could be a powerful section in your report)\\n19. You mentioned past solar failures were due to \\\"used batteries, bad BMSs, contractors pocketing money.\\\" When did you learn this? Was this from one specific interview or did multiple people tell you the same story?\\nOn the government subsidy opportunity (Wifaq's insight):\\n20. This seems HUGE - people can get government money back for construction materials. Why isn't everyone already doing this? What's the barrier? And how does your training help unlock this?\\n21. When Wifaq told you about this subsidy, what was your immediate reaction? Did this change your curriculum design?\\nOn the 80/20 principle and \\\"what about this?\\\" questions:\\n22. You wanted to teach \\\"the few things that make you dangerous in the market.\\\" For insulation specifically - what ARE those few things? (Like if you could only teach 3 techniques, what would they be?)\\n23. When trainers kept asking \\\"but what about this? but what about this?\\\" - were they worried their expertise wasn't being captured? Or were they genuinely trying to help participants? (This tension between comprehensiveness and simplicity is real)\\nOn heritage and \\\"homes that feel like home\\\":\\n24. You said everyone has memories of grandparents' homes that worked surprisingly well. Did any specific story from a trainer or participant stick with you? (These personal stories make reports come alive)\\n25. \\\"Curved roads for privacy\\\" - that's a values-based principle, not just technical. What other values-based principles came up? (Because this seems like a key insight about what \\\"heritage-informed\\\" really means)\\nOn community building and coalition:\\n26. You said bringing trainers together made them feel like \\\"a thing\\\" - like they're part of something. Was there a specific moment during the ToT where you SAW this happening? (Like - did two trainers exchange numbers? Did someone say something that showed they felt part of a community?)\\n27. You have three separate trainer groups (insulation, solar, architecture). What's your vision for connecting them long-term? The monthly reunion is one piece - but after that?\\nOn the market vs. skills problem:\\n28. You said \\\"you can give people skills but if nobody wants those skills, it's a problem.\\\" So the awareness campaign is crucial. But WHO needs to be aware? Homeowners? Contractors? Government officials? All three?\\n29. You mentioned \\\"don't be so UN-based NGO about it\\\" - what did you mean by that? What would a non-NGO approach look like?\\nOn what you learned about yourself:\\n30. You've been doing this for a year - flying from France to Iraq, interviewing experts, building curriculum. What's ONE thing you learned about training design that you didn't know before?\\n31. What's the hardest trade-off you had to make in the curriculum? (Like - you wanted to include X but had to cut it because of Y)\\n\\nAnswer whichever questions pull at you most. And YES - send me the vision document and your interview with Dr. Omar when you can. Those will be incredibly helpful.\\nAlso - that government subsidy insight from Wifaq? That feels like it should be PROMINENT in your report. That's a systems-level leverage point.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRetry\\nBG\\nOkay. Great. I'm gonna answer the first questions that you asked. That I didn't really answer yet. I as you Reframe that. Yeah. So let's see. Too much information at once. Really? Is that what they said? Yeah. So the difficult thing is we have 5 days, and it was not decided by me. Was thinking 20 days, and I was thinking 4 trainings. But really, I think because we have some constraints, we need to go into 5 days. And that means that we are going to have to have a lot of information. But like I said earlier, we wanna to have a have a yell, m g. To have the information, but to But to, to make it so that people can know the 80 8020. Right? Like, This is the broad overview. You need to know all of these things, all the different ways of intervening, and in the end, your likely going to use this. So for, insulation, it's going to be working on the roof and doing a thermal paint. Sealing the cracks the windows and, which is like a plaster that is, insulating on the walls if there's funds. Otherwise, it's gonna be the first 2. So that's like that's what you do. Whatever the person's situation is, And so I We want them to do that. And Really, no, like, convection and r values and u values and all technical stuff. They're they're also supposed to be technical people to begin with. So we are hoping that they come with some information They they come with some information. And then we want them to be able to learn some new things, particularly Thank you. Less about all this technical stuff and more about how to sell how to install, And to inspire them to start looking for jobs, feeling more confident because they have a certificate from the ITC, which is actually kind of important. It's something we didn't talk about yet. Yeah. And so to feel more confident to just apply for jobs by saying, I did this. Right? I have some skills. Like, I'm not just random person emailing you the fresh bread. So that's one. And, So secondly, and then the other thing is, We want them to, be able to start businesses and to feel confident for that, and that's why we get them to call suppliers. That's really important that they have their own relationships Actually, that's a huge thing that, you know, in terms of, like, the job and marketplace connection part of this report, it's, like, really important, we should emphasize this, in the report. That we want them to build relationships both with the trainers themselves each other, the kind of ecosystem, and also suppliers and customers. And so they're gonna be calling people, talking to people, breaking that sort of inner barrier of feeling like who am I to to do this? And you could give an excuse early because you say, hey. I'm a student. I'm learning. But that opens the door for later things. So that's also another really important element I'd like to take all of these things that I've said, oh, it's really important insightful. Like, let's make sure to keep track of that. And make sure to add it, in the report and that the report kind of emphasize emphasizes it. I'll be with you too. Okay. I think that's good. I think it's good for now. I'll start answering the the other questions. Okay. On the rag side, if it works, what's the dream scenario? So, yeah, the participant I'm I was saying mostly for the trainer at first, but the trainer comes and he says, Oh, shoot. Didn't prepare for the day at all. What am I doing today? And you could just say, okay. So it's day 2. What am I supposed to do? And it tells him, like, these are the main topics. This is what you do. Or, maybe the, trainer says, okay. I can't remember the equation for this. And you gotta talk to And I think that's actually very similar to what the, walk them through the equation and guide them even on the material. I actually have a list of materials a spreadsheet with all the r values, and all the different content that I've, kind of generated over time, not just all the trainer interviews. You know, I have different presentations. I have papers. So, yeah, I wanted to be able to ask that, but then also definitely to be able to get to the the source. And actually to connect to each other, to the trainers, to the supply suppliers. You know? Like, if I put in a supplier database in there, I think I have some some materials that you can say, okay. I I got this project. What's a good material, and what are the, like, specifications? Right? And it should be able to know that and do that. And and the other thing is, like, the the rag is great, but I think that we need to kind of have maybe more structured use cases. So instead of, like, free form text, it's sort of like Mad Libs or something else. I'm not exactly sure. Maybe you can help me think about how to do that best where There's, like, templated, questions and maybe different views or endpoints for different users. Even for the MNE person. Right? Like, it would be great to say, how many interviews, did Belet have? And then they could just say, yeah, x, y, z interviews and show them them. Lots of misconceptions, top 3 misconceptions, Okay. Solar doesn't work. The battery dies, too fast. And the cost of the replacement of the battery is gonna be too, expensive. There's no room in our modern houses for gardens anymore. And the is kind of ignoring the modern, garden design for small spaces that is definitely possible. And even rooftop gardens. And, like, That There's really nothing we can do on the roof after the tile has been installed to reduce, the heat load. I'm not sure that's, like, a huge misconception. I just think it's a blind So it's like misconceptions and blind spots. Just like things that don't people don't even know, like, you could actually have a rooftop garden and what it could provide for you And then the other thing is the, all of the other blind spots have all the benefits. So for instance, people don't even know that increasing, home temperatures increases divorce rates. If they did, they might wanna do something about it. Right? A little bit more instead of just being like, I can deal with it. And other things, in terms of, oh, another one is some people think air conditioners actually filter the air so that the viruses don't come through. But in fact, that's actually why people get sick more in the winter be or summer because they just stay indoors circulating viruses. Not all ACs do that, maybe not most. And then when was the last time you changed your filter? So these are, like, some really important ones. Yeah. Use battery, bed, BMS, contractors pocketing money. Yeah. These are people from the interviews. Multiple people told me the same story for sure. Actually, I asked every trainer, like, what are the biggest problem that you see, when people are doing installs for solar? Need to get them answered in their own way and when I give you the, the transcripts, I think you can find them. I think maybe that should be something that we 4 And, actually, it gets it gives me an idea. Like, I feel like you should help me come up with the prompt, and, like, the ideas that I want to be, asking the extractor that pulls information out of my context and my content for instance, like, the biggest problem, stories, other things that I seem to be missing, I think, are, like, systems thing and, like, working with the governments. It wasn't really a huge one. And we felt definitely had some great ideas. I don't actually know. I think it's like I don't and I think that not a lot of people know about that. Like, nobody else told me about it. Right. And so he mentioned it. I was so excited I did not change the curriculum design because it's it's like it's work to do with the government. To add the materials for installation as a subsidy. It's not it doesn't actually exist yet. For these materials. I don't know exactly what the materials are, but it's, for something else. That he thought we could You know, get on top of and do other things. Make it dangerous for the market, installations specifically. Do we need to add that to this, document? I'm not sure. If That's the most things to this document, instead of putting it into the trainer guide, 3 most things to learn. What about this? What about this? Oh, I think they're nerds, actually. The trainers are big nerds, and they did sort of want to share ideas some of them are really deeply passionate about the participants, and those are the ones that were high I'll answer 24 and 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 3031 the next one. I don't have time. More questions?\\n\\nShow more\\n\\n\\n\\nSynthesized insights and identified gaps for structured RAG implementation.\\n\\n\\n15s\\n\\n\\nWow, this is great. The user is giving me SO much authentic content. Let me capture the key insights they just shared:\\n\\t1\\t5 days not 20 days - they wanted more time but had constraints\\n\\t2\\t80/20 principle for insulation: roof + thermal paint, seal window cracks, insulating plaster on walls (if funds allow)\\n\\t3\\tCertificate from ITC matters - gives fresh grads confidence\\n\\t4\\tRelationship building is HUGE: trainers, peers, suppliers, customers - \\\"breaking that inner barrier\\\"\\n\\t5\\tStudents can use \\\"I'm learning\\\" as an excuse/opener to build relationships\\n\\t6\\tRAG system use cases:\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tTrainer: \\\"It's day 2, what do I do?\\\"\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tTrainer: \\\"What's the equation?\\\"\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tAnyone: \\\"I have this project, what material specs?\\\"\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tM&E: \\\"How many interviews did Bilal have?\\\"\\n\\t7\\tTop misconceptions/blind spots:\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tSolar doesn't work / batteries die too fast\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tNo room for gardens in modern houses (ignoring rooftop gardens)\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tNothing can be done after tiles installed (blind spot)\\n\\t\\u25e6\\tDon't know benefits like: high temps \\u2192 divorce rates, AC doesn't filter viruses properly\\n\\t8\\tUsed batteries/bad BMS/pocketing: multiple trainers said this, asked everyone \\\"what's the biggest problem with solar installs?\\\"\\n\\t9\\tGovernment subsidy insight from Wifaq: doesn't exist YET for insulation materials, but exists for other materials - could advocate to expand it\\n\\t10\\tTrainers are \\\"nerds\\\" - genuinely passionate, want to share\\nNow let me ask focused questions that will help fill in gaps and create narrative flow for the report. I should:\\n\\t\\u2022\\tFocus on the remaining questions (24-31) but maybe simplify\\n\\t\\u2022\\tAdd a few NEW questions based on what they just revealed\\n\\t\\u2022\\tHelp them think about structure/narrative\\nI'll dig deeper into the RAG system's practical implementation. I want concrete examples of how trainers and students might use these templates in real-world scenarios. What specific prompts or endpoints could make the system truly useful? I'll probe for moment-by-moment interactions that reveal the system's potential to solve immediate learning challenges.\\nThis is excellent. I'm capturing all of this. Let me focus on the remaining questions (24-31) but I'll make them more targeted, plus add a couple new ones based on what you just told me:\\nHeritage stories & values (24-25):\\n24. You mentioned \\\"everyone has memories of grandparents' homes.\\\" Did anyone in the ToT actually SHARE one of those stories? Even just a sentence like \\\"my grandfather's house had X and it was always cool even in summer\\\"? (These moments are gold for your report)\\n25. Beyond curved roads for privacy - did any other values-based principles come up? Like social cohesion, family structure, hospitality, anything like that?\\nCommunity moments (26-27):\\n26. During the ToT, was there a specific moment where you could SEE the trainers connecting? Like did they exchange numbers, argue about something technical then laugh, anything?\\n27. After the monthly reunion, what keeps the coalition alive? WhatsApp group? Annual meet-up? Or is it just organic?\\nAwareness campaign targets (28-29):\\n28. Your awareness campaign - WHO is the primary audience? You mentioned participants becoming advocates, sharing on social media. Are you trying to reach homeowners directly? Or contractors? Or influence the \\\"bosses\\\" that junior architects think won't go for green design?\\n29. You said \\\"don't be so UN-based NGO about it\\\" - I think you mean be more direct/real about problems like rising fuel costs, health impacts, ugly noisy generators? Is that right? Like - less diplomatic, more honest?\\nWhat you learned (30-31):\\n30. Biggest thing you learned about training design this year that surprised you? (Like - was it something about how people learn? About logistics? About Iraqi context?)\\n31. Hardest trade-off in the curriculum? What did you WANT to include but couldn't?\\n\\nNEW questions based on what you just shared:\\n32. The \\\"I'm a student, I'm learning\\\" as an opener to call suppliers - whose idea was that? Yours? A trainer's? (This is brilliant and should be highlighted)\\n33. You have a materials spreadsheet with R-values. How did you build that? Did trainers give you conflicting data? How did you decide what to trust?\\n34. The government subsidy thing - if it doesn't exist yet for insulation materials, is there a specific advocacy action you're recommending? Like \\\"ITC should work with Ministry of X to expand the subsidy program\\\"?\\n35. You said some trainers are \\\"really deeply passionate about participants.\\\" Give me ONE name and ONE example of how they showed that passion. (Specific beats general)\\n36. The RAG system - you mentioned \\\"templated questions, maybe different views/endpoints for different users.\\\" Give me 3 concrete examples:\\n\\t\\u2022\\tTrainer endpoint: [example]\\n\\t\\u2022\\tParticipant endpoint: [example]\\n\\t\\u2022\\tM&E/ITC endpoint: [example]\\n\\nTake your time, answer what resonates. And yes - I'm keeping a master list of \\\"really important insights to emphasize in report.\\\" We'll make sure none of this gold gets lost.\\nOne structural question: How do YOU want to organize the final report? Chronologically (planning \\u2192 ToT \\u2192 next steps)? By module (Solar/Insulation/Architecture)? By theme (curriculum design, community building, market barriers, job placement)? What feels most natural to you?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRetry\\n\\npdf\\nBG\\nOkay. So this is gonna be the last round of questions. And then I want to think with you about what the prompts are or, like, what the questions I wanna be asking my data are for the reg or you know, to help write the report, Yeah. Even even the reg to help break the report could be good. So I I want something that, like, prompting, structuring the questions, like, what should I be asking, what should I be 4 health. And I'll give you next the, the actual TOR, and I'm just doing the 3rd the third one. There's, like, 3 parts. So I'm gonna be doing the third one. And then, Yeah. Hopefully, that'll be Good. Yeah. Chronologically, it's probably good. Here. Let's go to the questions. Didn't get to all the rest. Right? So let's go over here. I mean, not so NGO about it by, like, pulling punches, not talking about corruption, not talking about you know, people selling bad products and just likes being kinda clear and straightforward is all I mean. Yeah. Bringing them together like a thing. That's actually a really important part of, the project. They're like, what should we do next with the trainers? I think we should at least twice, year, gather them together, ask them how the trainings are going, Although, the you know, maybe we need to do it more during the course of, like, the training. Because the training is gonna happen earlier maybe within a year or 2. So, yeah, gathering them together regularly, most of the space already has convening power, and they have something called climate space they've been doing. And so maybe we can kinda it to that. There are other elements of the, project from project 8, that we could be, leveraging. And we can be, Connecting to we can be connecting to 3 point 2, which I think has, like, a design competition to build 200 houses in Molsland. And they're gonna be trying to get, like, a retrofit product startup basically that they're trying to sponsor. And from there, they want to, build 200 houses as kinda like model homes. Baby. And then from there, so that that's, like, something that we can connect with maybe I was suggesting, but it just is really hard to make these things happen. So I I can put it in the recommendation can tell them I've told them a 100 times, but I don't really know how to just maybe I'm not politically savvy enough. But basically, they're gonna be doing their design competition. And gonna be spending money on the events. We don't have as much money in our budget for hosting events, but I think we should do Sort of like a like a a green home festival or something where we get the different, people, from the the okay? Hi, blubber. Where we get to, bring the market together, all the suppliers and the vendors and the students and the participants And the glover glover. Hope it's your body. Hello. And the participants and to get them to do something in at this you know, to bring them all together and, like, what is it called? A fair or showcase or something like that. Green business fair where where we can actually see all the products, that are available people could be, you know, maybe even having launching for their business or, like, raising money or, like, we could do matchmaking, mentors and cofounders and Like, you know, we could do so much. If we had The this fair or this event I could have, like, a jobs fair, you know? And things like that. And so And so I think we should do that, but where we're gonna get the money to do it? What project is it gonna connect to? We're doing 3.3. It could be a part of the design competition, you know, At the end of the design competition, Connected the homes they're showcasing of the, designs for the, retrofit projects for the homes we already had a hackathon last year. We have the beginning of, like, all these different pieces of community, from the hackathon from all of the trainers that I've been talking to, for so long. You know, like, I've I've annoyed them so much. Over this time period. And now they've they started to meet each other. And so I feel like we really can activate and galvanize this momentum. And, actually, I ask you a question. Like, how can we like, now that you know about all this, how can we really, take advantage of this to do something great, you know, and really activate the community and leverage, all of the different moving pieces of this project from the homes to the design competition, to the training, that we're doing and to put them together. And this is why I've been thinking about and wondering about there's 2 things. You know? Like, I I guess I'm, like, a digital person. So I was like, oh, is there, like, a digital home? Know, maybe it's connected to the reg element, but just like one place where people can see all the different things. Right? And then we can have all of our different trainers. And maybe that could be a good thing. Have you leaned in your leg? And we can have all of the different trainers that have been selected and their credentials and even, like, the participants. And so we can even say, like, these people went through this program hire them. Here's their LinkedIns, and we can connect their LinkedIn profile. And and other things like that. And that could be great. If they don't have a LinkedIn, that should be something that we do. And I really feel like that kind of thing where maybe initially I was thinking of it more as like, oh, here's a here's a website that has everything. You know, the materials, the suppliers, the data sheets, the training. You can even go on to do the training. But instead, maybe we could just, think of it as, like, the thing that houses the community. You know? And that's, like, one of the things that they've asked me to suggest. Like, what are the next steps? And I think seeing these people in action and especially when I send you the, the, TOT session audio as Arabic files, and the upcoming chats. Maybe you'll have some more ideas. I'll first only share the TOR, like, report But I don't necessarily just wanna do the report. Like, I wanna do a good job and wrap it up well. I've been working with them for almost a year and a half, so do it good. Doing this for a year. One thing about learning design that I didn't know before I guess, what can we say? Yeah. I think something about Making things simpler. Even simpler. You know? And having you know, splitting the day into 3 pieces and having, like, one clear message for each day one clear message for the like, the reason. Right? Like, why are people What are they why are they even showing up? For the trainers, for people, giving them, like, reasons and then ways that all the different and and building blocks, like add up to that. So you know, I think that's really great. Just, I I feel like I just don't want people to get lost. Know? And I want them to be excited. Does it have any initial fiddler? Hardest trade off. It's about time Yeah. I wanted more hands on stuff, like I think it would be really great if people were actually Just, you know, More hands on. Just, like, doing things, getting, a feel for the materials, installing it multiple times, and really just getting more, like, community and, like, team orientation and getting everyone to feel like they're a part of a single project and team and getting them to go and tour the city and to, like, document, the existing Like, green architecture that's still there, and then to, think for themselves and come up with their own principles and to, like, really work in this kind of different way. But of all, it would be hard to teach other people how to do that. I feel like that would be something that would take a longer t o t to get people to think differently about training, not being something that you give, but but, experience that you create that creates co learning moments. And, yeah, also more hands on stuff and things like that. And let's do the new questions, man. There's just so many questions. Everyone has grandparents' homes. Yeah. Some people talked about their The homes of their families Saders Lake. Oh, Barhead. Wow. Yes. And yeah, that was an icebreaker. And so I'm continuing to use that icebreaker. Actually, that's an important thing to have, icebreakers. Like, we need to talk about all the icebreakers everyone should be doing every day.\\n\\nShow more\\n\\n\\n\\nSynthesized project insights and mapped strategic next steps forward.\\n\\n\\n16s\\n\\n\\nThis is amazing context. Let me capture the key insights from this response:\\n\\t1\\tNot being \\\"UN-NGO about it\\\" = being direct about corruption, bad products, pulling no punches\\n\\t2\\tBringing trainers together = convening them 2x/year, leveraging Mosul Space's \\\"Climate Space\\\" existing convening power\\n\\t3\\tConnection to 3.2 = design competition to build 200 houses, retrofit product startup, model homes\\n\\t4\\tGreen Home Festival/Fair idea = bringing suppliers, vendors, students, participants together for showcase/matchmaking/jobs fair. Could connect to design competition finale. Challenge: budget and political navigation.\\n\\t5\\tExisting momentum = hackathon last year, trainer network built over time, community starting to coalesce\\n\\t6\\tDigital home vision = initially thought of as comprehensive website (materials, suppliers, data, training), now thinking more as \\\"the thing that houses the community\\\" - trainer profiles with credentials, participant profiles with LinkedIns for hiring\\n\\t7\\tWhat he learned about learning design = \\\"Making things simpler. Even simpler.\\\" Splitting day into 3 pieces, one clear message per day, building blocks that add up to clear \\\"why are people showing up\\\" reason\\n\\t8\\tHardest trade-off = TIME. Wanted more hands-on, material exploration, community/team building, city tours documenting existing green architecture, co-created learning experiences vs. \\\"training you give.\\\" But that would require longer ToT to shift mindsets.\\n\\t9\\tIcebreaker = grandparents' homes stories (worked well, continuing to use)\\nNow let me answer the remaining questions and then help him think about the RAG prompts and report structure.\\nHe's ready to:\\n\\t1\\tFinish the last questions (24-31)\\n\\t2\\tGet the ToR\\n\\t3\\tThink about what prompts/questions to ask his data for the RAG\\n\\t4\\tStructure the report (he's doing Output 3 from the ToR)\\nI'll focus on the next steps with precision and strategic planning. The priority is to wrap up the remaining technical questions efficiently, secure the Terms of Reference, and develop a clear approach for data retrieval and report structuring. I'll break this down into actionable components, ensuring we capture the essential details while maintaining momentum from the previous work.\\nPerfect. This is crystallizing beautifully. Let me answer your clarifications and then we'll pivot to the RAG prompts and report structure.\\n\\nQuick responses to your clarifications:\\n\\\"Not so UN-NGO\\\" = Got it. Direct about corruption, bad materials, generator costs rising, health impacts. No diplomatic hedging.\\nGreen Home Festival/Fair = This feels ESSENTIAL and should be a major recommendation. Even if budget is tight, you can frame it as: \\\"Leverage the 3.2 design competition finale as the anchor event, and expand it into a Green Business Fair with minimal additional cost by...\\\"\\nDigital home as community hub = This is brilliant reframing. Not a comprehensive portal (too ambitious), but a community directory: trainer profiles with credentials, participant portfolios with LinkedIns, supplier database. Makes hiring/matching/connecting easy. This should be in recommendations.\\n\\\"Even simpler\\\" = This is a key learning. The \\\"one clear message per day\\\" principle.\\nHardest trade-off (TIME) = The co-created learning experience you wanted vs. what you could fit in 5 days. This belongs in your report as a reflection.\\nIcebreaker about grandparents' homes = Perfect.

Ready to tackle those last questions (24-31)?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRetry\\nBG\\nOkay. So I'm gonna answer 20 4 231 and I'll send some key interview transcripts. Yeah. Can you build the reg prompts based on everything? Maybe you have questions for me on Like, how we can make the right prompts better. So maybe you can ask me some questions to make sure I got you get the right information. And then for And also, like, yeah, I wanna think with you. I I asked you some questions about the rag and about having kind of templatized Mad Lib style things, what are other ways that we can do that? And maybe you can have 3 ideas about ways to do that better so we get structured Questions and not just, like, people looking at a blank screen with a cursor and wondering what's Okay. It's 24. Yeah. We already did that one. Specific moment. Yeah. Definitely saw them connecting. We're all on the same WhatsApp groups. They don't need to exchange numbers. But, people were asking each other about some of these kind of alternative things that they've done that Don't happen that often, and they wanted to get photos and, stories about people that did basically, like, insulating from the inside. You know, it's it's usually better to insulate the roof from the outside but one of the people had, like, an insulation from the inside, because of some constraints, I don't remember why he couldn't do outside. And everyone was super interested to figure out how and what and A cool fiddler. Uncle Fitbit, play your time. And so, yeah. The, That was that was cool. Especially when they're, like, no way. Like, doesn't make sense. And he was like, yeah. It does. I can show you the numbers. And so got into it and kinda nerdy. About that kind of stuff, and I thought that was great. Specific moments connecting reunion. Yeah. They definitely had lunch together. I mean, it felt fun. It was nice. I think, everyone kind of connected. And we actually this is one really important thing. Every time I do my thing, I always tell people to have good intentions. Like, We're here to stack all the intentions. Right? So we're here for the benefit of people. Are living in difficult situations and paying too much and want to benefit them by saving money and save also protect the environment and, pollution and also to, know, at some level, I'll make money and have a job. And so and feed our families. And so how can we set ourselves up to be in service so that we, connect to this idea of the Muslim tradition that actions by their intentions and to try to make this entire project, an act of worship. I think it would be beautiful. And very culturally relevant, and everyone really resonated with that idea. And so, basically, I said that every single it's it's another one of those one thing things where I'm trying to get one thing all the way through. Who is your primary audience? Yeah. It's like the potential customers, I think. Initially, for the solar, and installation and architecture. We want them to be on Uh-huh. To get at least growing awareness. And to grow that And then the bosses that the junior architects think won't go for green design, they kind of get convinced when people get convinced. So that's why we are inviting the bosses to the final day where they're presenting their designs, with the community of people they designed it for. Biggest thing I learned about training design I think it's about Yeah. Doing things in a way where there's one clear message, I think, is super important so people know what they're doing and what they're taking away. And not, you know, having all the content, but people, listen. If you if you get this one thing, you're good today. No. I think I answered all those questions already about trade off in the curriculum and stuff. Yeah. It was my idea. Okay. Well, now let's highlight the students, learning thing. To kind of help them ease into the marketplace and develop relationships. I think that's another important thing. I wanted to say, like, hey. You're gonna develop relationships in this thing. And that's gonna be something that you take out of the training. It's not just the knowledge or the skills. Advocacy action. Yeah. I definitely, we should talk with Wipao and get the ideas and ask ITC to explore these options and and others. I know they're already talking with the government but exactly how I know that there's something about the, the engineers union. It's like one of the communities that we are working with and they're going to be contributing to the project And really important to involve them, but I'm not exactly sure how. It's like what exactly is this engineers union? I know that it's a big deal in Iraq, and I think when people graduate, they become a part of it. Maybe you have some more information about that, but my colleague, Lada, has the one in interacting with him mostly. Yeah. So One of the participants, Omar, basically, like, I've had maybe 3 or 4 calls before the TOT and, he was has a lot of experience. And there's not a lot of people that have this, experience. He's an architect, and he just is passionate. And he keeps, like, very sharing and caring and his primary idea is, like, if you really help people, you will make a business, you'll make a life, and you know that you're really successful when people start inviting you to their weddings. And that's really beautiful. Rag system, it's not really done, so I'm not really sure I want to supereemphasize it. Yeah. Different endpoints for different users. So a trainer was the initial use case. I was thinking about participants, maybe, to be able to find, like, materials and equations and stuff. And the ITC just to, like, ask questions like, well, how many trainings have happened? Oh, sorry. How many, t o TOT trainings happened? Was the percentage of men and women, etcetera? And, yeah. I think that's it. And I'll give you the some of the content from the DOT is next. And then Maybe you could even run it against the rag questions, or you can even, like, ask me the right questions yourself. And find ways of maybe getting more insights from me to develop the right questions better. So we can see kind of, like, a demo response. Because you're a LLM, so you can, you know, pretend to be taking this rag question against the content. That I'll share in the next message.\\n\\nShow more\\n\\n\\n\\nOrchestrated RAG design strategy, clarifying questions, and three structured interface concepts.\\n\\nGreat! The user is wrapping up the question answers and now wants me to:\\n\\t1\\tBuild RAG prompts based on everything we've discussed\\n\\t2\\tAsk questions to make sure I get the right information for RAG design\\n\\t3\\tSuggest 3 ideas for structured/templatized interfaces (not just blank cursor)\\n\\t4\\tEventually test the RAG against actual content they'll share\\nLet me first acknowledge what they shared, then ask strategic questions about RAG implementation, then propose the 3 interface ideas.\\nKey new info from their answers:\\n\\t\\u2022\\tTrainers nerding out about inside vs outside insulation (good community moment)\\n\\t\\u2022\\tThe \\\"actions by their intentions\\\" framing - culturally relevant, service orientation, act of worship\\n\\t\\u2022\\tPrimary audience is potential customers (homeowners), then bosses get convinced when market moves\\n\\t\\u2022\\t\\\"I'm a student, I'm learning\\\" was user's idea for relationship building\\n\\t\\u2022\\tOmar (architect) - \\\"you're successful when people invite you to weddings\\\" - beautiful\\n\\t\\u2022\\tEngineers Union is important but user doesn't fully understand their role yet\\n\\t\\u2022\\tRAG is not done yet, so don't over-emphasize\\nNow I need to:\\n\\t1\\tAsk clarifying questions about RAG system design\\n\\t2\\tPropose 3 structured interface ideas\\n\\t3\\tPrepare to receive content and demo RAG responses\\nPerfect! I love the \\\"actions by their intentions\\\" framing - that's powerful and should absolutely be in the report as a design principle. And Omar's \\\"when they invite you to their weddings\\\" - that's the kind of authentic voice that makes a report come alive.\\n\\nQuestions I need answered for RAG system design:\\n1.

(e.g., participants can't see M&E data, trainers can't see participant performance data)\\n\\t\\u2022\\tFor the directory/community hub - should profiles be public or login-required?\\n3.

So I'm not sure actually. I also feel like the information that people ask sometimes is like giving it information. Right? So maybe it can auto update, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe they can hire me for that. Could be cool, because I would like another contract. I could be in charge of kind of, the data warehousing and all they have to do is, like, send me the trainer audio. Because I could really use that. I hope they'll let me because I feel like it'll be super helpful actually And that way, also, we can do, feedback, improvements of the training hopefully, they'll be willing Trainers are gonna be doing it all in Arabic. It's gonna be in Arabic. Okay. Yeah. So that's it. That's my answers. And then, in in the next one, I will send you the, content Actually, like, can you review the, the document for tor that describes what we're supposed to be doing. And then can you give me Oh, come on. Can you give me, like, what I might be doing extra and what they ask 4 and you think I gave you enough from This long chat to, the document? And maybe even before doing anything else with, like, the rag and all of that stuff, Let's just You know, compile all of the insights from this long winded conversation, all the questions that I answered, and, structure it so that we have, like, high quality verbatim content from me so that, we don't have, just this long conversation that doesn't get really leveraged well. Well, I want to be sure that everything that I've said that's useful, especially the things that I said, wow. Important. So I think I've said that a few times. Let's not forget to. You know? Let's take, 2 steps, to, first, make a an artifact that has all of my content Technically sort of boarded. You know? And it should be my verbatim text. Maybe you can have the question and then, like, the answer for me or something like that. In the structured way. Yola, have you got a Sheater's like sheater's like she she she she we yeah. That way, we get some high quality content before it gets out of your context and window or you forget. So so let's go, like, pull it out, make this file.

Looking at Section 11 and your new paragraph, plus what I know about your values from our past conversations, I can see the tension.\n\n**Here's what I'm noticing:**\n\nSection 11 currently reads like a **consulting deliverable** - lots of structures, frameworks, budgets, phases, timelines. It's comprehensive but feels prescriptive and externally-imposed rather than organically emerging.\n\nYour new paragraph is trying to say something more like: *\"The real sustainability comes from building genuine community where people actually want to show up because it serves them, not because we've created elaborate structures.\"*\n\n**Questions to help align Section 11 with what you actually believe:**\n\n1. **The Climate Space connection**: You mention bridging with the existing Climate Space at Mosul Space. What's actually happening there now? What makes it work without all these elaborate frameworks? What would it look like to simply *extend* what's already working rather than building parallel structures?\n\n2. **Mutually beneficial vs. structured**: The document proposes master trainers, bi-annual gatherings, monthly reunions, certification programs, etc. But what if sustainability just looked like: \"People keep meeting because they're getting real value\"? What's the *minimum viable* structure that allows genuine mutual benefit to emerge?\n\n3. **Indigenous and authentic**: You wrote \"authentic and indigenous and truly providing value.\" What does indigenous sustainability look like in Mosul's context? Not the word \"indigenous\" in an abstract sense, but: What are the natural patterns of how knowledge already spreads there? How do communities already self-organize? What are you working *with* rather than imposing?\n\n4. **The festival**: Section 11.7 proposes an elaborate Green Home Festival. But is that really aligned with organic community building? Or is it more consultant-speak? If you were just following what wants to happen naturally, what would emerge instead?\n\n5. **Financial sustainability**: The document has detailed break-even analyses, revenue scenarios, cost-per-cohort calculations. But you've said before that putting metrics first often kills the life of something. What if sustainability isn't about break-even math but about: \"Is this actually serving people enough that they'll figure out how to keep it going\"?\n\n6. **Your actual role going forward**: What do YOU want your relationship to this community to be? The document implies ongoing coordination, updates, management. But is that authentic to you? Or would you rather create conditions for emergence and then step back?\n\n**The core tension I'm sensing:**\n\nThe document treats sustainability as something to *engineer* through correct structures. But you seem to believe sustainability emerges when something is *genuinely alive* - when it serves real needs so well that people naturally keep it going.\n\nWhich frame feels true to you? And if it's the second one, what would Section 11 look like if it trusted emergence more than structure?",

Look at the feedback forms and insights\n2. Extract relevant information\n3. Rewrite Section 11 as a markdown file that's authentic to their vision\n\nLet me first examine the uploaded files to see what insights are there.Let me review the feedback forms and insights data to inform the rewrite.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood, I can see feedback from the Insulation ToT. Let me check the other files to get a complete picture.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nNow let me check the solar job placement form and the insights JSON.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood. Now let me check the insights JSON file to see what patterns emerged from the interviews.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nPerfect. Now I have enough information. Let me synthesize what I've learned:\n\nFrom the feedback forms:\n1. Trainers want more field visits and practical experiences\n2. Some want freedom to adapt presentation while keeping core content\n3. Need better session management (some participants dominated)\n4. Some universities (Al-Noor) offered to host and create formal relationships\n5. Requests for longer training duration and advance notice with more details\n6. Multiple trainers open to hosting trainees (\"Maybe\" and \"Yes\" responses)\n\nFrom the solar job placement form:\n- Emphasis on trust crisis in Mosul market (low quality installers)\n- CVs not trusted, companies use trial periods instead\n- Need for manufacturer-certified training (Gesag, Noon, etc.)\n- Regional awareness gap (Sulaymaniyah tech-savvy vs Mosul 0% awareness)\n- Practical skills valued: installation, testing, customer education\n- Companies willing to collaborate but need to see value first\n\nFrom insights JSON:\n- Critical theme: Quality crisis destroying solar reputation\n- Market barrier: cheap installers promising unrealistic specs\n- Customer education needed (two-track approach)\n- Need for manufacturer partnerships\n- Prerequisite technical knowledge essential\n- Hands-on curriculum structure works\n\nNow I need to rewrite Section 11 based on:\n1. User's authentic voice (organic emergence, not over-prescribed)\n2. Climate Space integration (already existing, support it)\n3. Minimal structure that enables emergence (\"petri dish\")\n4. One yearly event + smaller events = good rhythm\n5. Remove detailed financial break-even\n6. Suggest festival but don't prescribe details\n7. Digital platform for trainer directory and quality assurance\n8. User's role: interviews, ToT facilitation, digital infrastructure\n\nLet me create the new Section 11.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood! I've created the revised Section 11. Now let me provide a summary for the user of what changed and why.Done! [View your revised Section 11](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Section_11_Sustainability_Plan_Revised.md)\n\n## What Changed and Why\n\n**Major Shifts in Approach:**\n\n1. **From prescriptive to emergent**: Removed detailed break-even analyses, rigid phase structures, and over-engineered frameworks. Instead, focused on creating conditions for organic growth.\n\n2. **Climate Space integration**: Made Mosul Space's existing monthly gatherings the *foundation* rather than creating parallel structures. This honors what's already working.\n\n3. **Master trainers reconceived**: Changed from formal certification hierarchy to natural recognition of trainers who are already leading through quality and generosity.\n\n4. **Events simplified**: Annual showcase is now a *suggestion* to piggyback on the 3.2 Design Competition, not a detailed prescription. Monthly touchpoints through existing Climate Space rhythm.\n\n5. **Financial sustainability**: Removed break-even math and cost-per-cohort calculations. Instead, listed potential funding sources as possibilities to explore, emphasizing \"value creation attracts funding\" over \"engineer sustainability through correct structures.\"\n\n6. **Digital platform**: Kept the vision but simplified Phase 1 to Airtable/Google Sheets. Quality assurance through community review and double-blind verification, addressing the \"CVs aren't trusted\" insight from solar partners.\n\n7. **Your role**: Explicitly named your continuing involvement in interviews, ToT facilitation, and digital infrastructure—the parts you actually enjoy and want to do.\n\n8. **Tone shift**: From consultant-speak (\"implement the following mechanisms\") to authentic voice (\"this is a suggestion, see what emerges\"). Trusts the community to figure out what works.\n\n9. **Key insights integrated**: \n   - Government subsidy advocacy (from Wifaq)\n   - Quality crisis in solar market (from Ali Abkan interviews)\n   - University partnerships (from Saad Salih, Abdulhakim)\n   - Need for practical field visits (from ToT feedback)\n\n**What Got Cut:**\n- Detailed budgets and cost breakdowns\n- Rigid 5-year phase timelines with prescribed milestones\n- Elaborate festival planning (kept concept, removed implementation details)\n- Over-engineered RAG system details\n- Bureaucratic MoU specifications\n\n**What Got Added:**\n- Honest framing: \"sustainability through service, not structure\"\n- Trust in emergence over engineering\n- Integration with what already exists\n- Quality assurance addressing market trust crisis\n- Your authentic vision about mutually beneficial community\n\n**Core Philosophy:** \"Sustainability isn't a plan. It's what happens when people find something worth sustaining.\"",

              "file_text": "# 11) Sustainability Plan: Creating Conditions for Community to Emerge\n\n## 11.1 Vision for Continuity\n\nThe ToT sessions (Sept-Oct 2025) are seeds, not solutions. Real sustainability happens when something serves people well enough that they naturally keep it going—when it becomes woven into how the community already works.\n\n**Guiding Principle** (from trainer discussions):\n*\"Actions by their intentions\"* — This work is framed as an act of service, not just a job. Trainers are motivated by helping Mosul rebuild, reducing energy poverty, and protecting the environment. Sustainability comes from honoring this intrinsic motivation while creating the minimal structure needed for genuine connection to flourish.\n\n## 11.2 Building on What Already Works: Climate Space Integration\n\n**The Reality Check:**\nMosul Space already runs \"Climate Space\" — monthly sessions where people gather to talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and activate community. This is working. It's organic. People show up because it serves them.\n\n**What This Means for Green Housing Training:**\nRather than building parallel structures, we connect to and strengthen what's already happening:\n\n- **Monthly Climate Space gatherings** become the natural home for trainer check-ins, troubleshooting sessions, and sharing real project experiences\n- **Existing social capital** at Mosul Space becomes the connective tissue for the green housing community\n- **Natural rhythm** of monthly touchpoints creates accountability without bureaucracy\n\n**Integration Approach:**\n- Add \"Green Housing Update\" segment to existing Climate Space sessions (30 minutes/month)\n- Use this time for trainers to share what's working, what's stuck, and what help they need\n- Create organic mentorship connections through these gatherings\n- Let relationships form naturally rather than assigning \"master trainers\"\n\n## 11.3 The Master Trainer Question: Quality Through Connection, Not Hierarchy\n\n**What We're Not Doing:**\nCreating formal \"master trainer\" certifications and hierarchical training cascades. That feels imposed and rigid.\n\n**What Emerges Instead:**\nSome trainers naturally become go-to resources because they:\n- Deliver excellent training and their participants succeed\n- Show up consistently to community gatherings\n- Are generous with their time and knowledge\n- Have institutional anchors (university positions, established companies)\n\n**Preliminary candidates** who have already demonstrated these qualities organically:\n\n| Name | Module | Natural Strengths | Institutional Connection |\n|------|--------|------------------|-------------------------|\n| Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel | Solar | University faculty, strong technical depth | University of Mosul |\n| Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | Solar | Company owner, practical experience | Aqtab Al-Taqa (solar company) |\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | Passionate about hands-on learning, architect | Al-Rafedyen Architects |\n| Wifaq Ahmed | Insulation/Heritage | Government subsidy knowledge, heritage expertise | Mosul Heritage Foundation |\n| Saad Salih Dhiab | Insulation | University faculty, willing to host field visits | Al-Noor University |\n\n**How This Works:**\n- These trainers naturally attract more trainees and mentees\n- They get invited to co-facilitate future ToT sessions (if they want to)\n- Mosul Space/ITC can offer modest stipends for their time, but motivation is intrinsic\n- No formal \"master trainer\" title or obligation—just recognition and support for those already leading\n\n## 11.4 Events as Touchpoints: Creating Rhythm Without Rigidity\n\n**The Pattern:**\nPeople need rhythm to stay connected, but not so much structure that it becomes burdensome.\n\n### One Major Annual Event: Green Housing Showcase\n**Concept:** Bring together trainers, graduates, employers, suppliers, policymakers for a 1-day celebration and connection event.\n\n**Timing:** Piggyback on Output 3.2 Design Competition Finale (2026) rather than creating separate event.\n\n**Core Elements:**\n- Portfolio showcase (graduates present before/after projects)\n- Design competition finale (architecture module)\n- Informal jobs fair (employers meet candidates)\n- Supplier expo (materials companies display products)\n- Awards and recognition (best retrofit impact, most innovative design, etc.)\n\n**Important:** This is a *suggestion* for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not a detailed prescription. If it's not feasible or doesn't feel right, that's fine. The community will find its own ways to celebrate and connect.\n\n### Monthly Climate Space Gatherings\n**What Happens:**\n- Green Housing update segment (30 min)\n- Trainers share project stories, challenges, wins\n- Problem-solving clinic (\"I'm stuck on X, anyone dealt with this?\")\n- Social connection over tea\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- Already happening—no new infrastructure needed\n- Low commitment (monthly, not weekly)\n- Flexible format (sometimes documentary, sometimes discussion, sometimes hands-on demo)\n- Builds trust and relationships over time\n\n### Post-Training 30-Day Reunion\n**Purpose:** Check in one month after each training cohort completes to see who's implementing what they learned.\n\n**Format:**\n- 2-hour gathering (in-person or Zoom)\n- \"Show & tell\" — participants share portfolio pieces, installations, designs\n- Accountability without pressure\n- Connect successful graduates with employers/clients looking for talent\n\n## 11.5 Digital Infrastructure: A Living Directory, Not a Static Database\n\n**The Need:**\nAs the community grows, people need ways to find each other—trainers looking for apprentices, clients looking for consultants, graduates looking for mentors, suppliers looking for installers.\n\n**Phase 1 (2026): Simple Trainer Directory**\n- Platform: Airtable or Google Sheets (accessible, no coding required)\n- Content:\n  - Trainer profiles (name, module, location, contact)\n  - Participant portfolios (photos, testimonials, project descriptions)\n  - Supplier list (materials, pricing, contact info)\n- Access: Public link, searchable by module/location\n- Maintenance: Mosul Space staff updates quarterly\n\n**Phase 2 (2027+): Quality Assurance Through Community Review**\n**The Challenge:** How do you maintain quality without formal audits?\n\n**Approach:**\n- Graduates can review their training experience (anonymous or signed)\n- Clients can review completed projects (with verification)\n- Peer feedback system where trainers review each other's materials\n- Double-blind quality checks by independent assessors (nonprofit or university)\n\n**Goal:** Create trusted signal in a market where CVs aren't trusted and cheap fraudulent work has damaged solar's reputation. Make quality visible and verifiable.\n\n**Note on RAG/AI System:** A more sophisticated AI-powered knowledge base (querying all transcripts, materials, case studies) is possible in future phases but not essential now. Start simple, add complexity only if needed.\n\n## 11.6 Funding Sustainability: Possibilities, Not Prescriptions\n\n**Current Reality:**\nITC funding supports initial ToT cohorts. What happens next?\n\n**Potential Funding Sources** (not requirements, just options to explore):\n\n1. **Employer-Sponsored Training**\n   - Solar companies send staff to ToT, pay training fee\n   - Already happening informally (companies sent employees to Oct ToT)\n   - Could formalize with ~50,000-100,000 IQD/participant fee\n\n2. **University Partnerships**\n   - Embed ToT into university continuing education programs\n   - Universities provide venue, reducing costs\n   - Dr. Abdulhakim (University of Mosul) and Saad Salih (Al-Noor University) expressed interest\n   - University certification adds credibility\n\n3. **Participant Fees (Sliding Scale)**\n   - Those who can afford to pay do (50,000 IQD)\n   - Those who can't, receive scholarships\n   - Revenue helps offset costs, but not required\n\n4. **Grant Funding**\n   - UNDP, GIZ, other development agencies value green skills training\n   - ITC/Mosul Space can apply for follow-on grants\n   - Strong track record from initial cohorts helps with future fundraising\n\n5. **Government Subsidy (Long-Term Advocacy)**\n   - Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials (cement, rebar)\n   - Potential to expand subsidy to include insulation materials\n   - Would dramatically increase market demand → more jobs for graduates\n   - Requires 2-3 year advocacy campaign (see Section 11.8)\n\n**Break-Even Is Not the Goal:**\nThe goal is value creation. If training genuinely helps people start businesses, get jobs, and improve their communities, funding will follow. The market will reveal which models work.\n\n## 11.7 Institutional Anchors: Where to Root This Work\n\nTo avoid \"hero-dependent\" sustainability (where everything collapses if one person leaves), root the work in institutions that will outlast individuals:\n\n### Anchor 1: Mosul Space (Convening Power)\n- Hosts Climate Space gatherings\n- Manages WhatsApp community groups\n- Coordinates logistics for events\n- Stable organization with diverse funding\n\n### Anchor 2: University of Mosul (Academic Credibility)\n- Partnership with Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel (solar)\n- Could embed ToT in continuing education\n- Access to facilities (classrooms, labs)\n- Long-term institutional stability\n\n### Anchor 3: Al-Noor University (Field Experience Hub)\n- Saad Salih Dhiab willing to host field visits\n- Offered formal partnership relationship\n- Can provide training venues\n\n### Anchor 4: Iraqi Engineering Union (Professional Recognition)\n- Potential to recognize ToT as professional development credit\n- Engineers need continuing education for licensure\n- Would increase participation and credibility\n\n**Next Step:** Draft simple MoUs (1-2 pages max) clarifying roles, not creating bureaucracy.\n\n## 11.8 Government Subsidy Advocacy: High-Impact Leverage Point\n\n**The Opportunity** (from Wifaq Ahmed, Mosul Heritage Foundation):\n\nIraqi government already subsidizes construction materials—homeowners get money back when buying cement and rebar. **What if this subsidy expanded to include insulation materials?**\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n- Current barrier: Insulation seen as \"luxury,\" not essential\n- With subsidy covering 30-50% of cost, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years\n- Mass adoption becomes economically feasible\n- Existing policy framework means expansion is politically realistic (not creating new program)\n\n**Advocacy Strategy** (Long-Term, 2-3 Years):\n\n1. **Document the case** (by Dec 2025)\n   - Compile ToT graduate case studies (energy savings, health benefits, comfort)\n   - Calculate: \"If government subsidized insulation → X households could afford it → Y jobs created → Z reduction in fuel imports\"\n\n2. **Build coalition**\n   - University of Mosul (academic credibility)\n   - Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement)\n   - Private sector suppliers (SIKA, SMTC benefit → will lobby)\n   - ITC (international reputation, economic development expertise)\n\n3. **Pilot demonstration** (2026)\n   - Retrofit 10-20 homes with insulation (ITC/UNDP funded)\n   - Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials\n   - Invite government officials to site visit at annual showcase event\n\n4. **Submit policy brief** (2026)\n   - ITC submits formal recommendation to Ministry of Construction & Housing\n   - Key message: \"Subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience—achievable by adding 5 items to existing subsidy list\"\n\n**ITC Role:** Leverage existing government relationships, provide technical analysis, coordinate coalition. This is long-term work but transformational if successful.\n\n## 11.9 Continuous Improvement: Learning From What Actually Happens\n\n**The Feedback Loop:**\n\n1. **Post-Training Surveys** (1 week after ToT)\n   - \"What worked? What needs improvement? Are you ready to train?\"\n   - Already implemented (see feedback forms)\n   - Key findings inform next cohort\n\n2. **30-Day Reunion Check-Ins**\n   - \"Did you deliver your first training? What challenges? What resources needed?\"\n   - Real-world implementation reveals curriculum gaps\n\n3. **Monthly Climate Space Discussions**\n   - Organic feedback emerges through regular gatherings\n   - \"Participants keep asking about X—should we add it to curriculum?\"\n\n4. **Employer Feedback** (from apprenticeship partners)\n   - \"Are graduates showing up with skills we need? What's missing?\"\n   - Closes loop between training content and market needs\n\n5. **Annual Curriculum Review**\n   - Once/year, trainers gather to update materials\n   - Add new technologies, remove outdated content\n   - Based on actual field experience, not speculation\n\n**Example of Adaptation:**\nIf multiple trainers report \"participants struggle with U-value calculations\" → add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems → test in next cohort → assess if it helped → keep if yes, iterate if no.\n\n## 11.10 What Role Does ITC Play Going Forward?\n\n**Short-Term (2025-2026):**\n- Fund initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad\n- Support annual showcase event (if feasible)\n- Develop digital trainer directory (Phase 1)\n- Facilitate university partnerships\n\n**Medium-Term (2026-2027):**\n- Transition coordination to Mosul Space\n- Support government subsidy advocacy campaign\n- Co-develop quality assurance systems\n- Document case studies for replication in other regions\n\n**Long-Term (2027+):**\n- Periodic check-ins, not daily management\n- Available for troubleshooting, but not driving\n- Share model with other Iraqi cities or conflict-affected regions\n- Let community own and evolve the work\n\n**Bilal's Continuing Role:**\n- Interviewing and synthesizing expert insights (when needed for expansions)\n- Co-facilitating ToT sessions (especially enjoyable)\n- Building and maintaining digital infrastructure\n- Developing quality assurance and review systems\n\n## 11.11 Scaling Strategy: If (And Only If) It's Working\n\n**Phase 1 (2025): Mosul Pilot** ✅ COMPLETE\n- 39 trainers across Solar, Insulation, Architecture\n- 3 ToT sessions delivered (Sept, Oct 2025)\n\n**Phase 2 (2026): Expansion to Anbar & Baghdad** (If Mosul model proves valuable)\n- Trainers from Mosul co-facilitate ToT in other governorates\n- Local partners identified (universities, NGOs) to host\n- Curriculum adapted for regional differences (climate, energy tariffs, market conditions)\n- Target: 60 additional trainers (20 per governorate)\n\n**Phase 3 (2027-2028): National Reach** (If demand emerges organically)\n- Formalize certification: \"ITC Certified Green Housing Trainer\"\n- Partner with Iraqi Engineering Union for professional recognition\n- Original trainers become regional ToT facilitators (if they want to)\n- Target: 200+ trainers nationwide\n\n**Important:** Scaling happens **only if** the community is healthy and trainers are succeeding. Growth for growth's sake kills what makes something work. Quality and authenticity first, scale second.\n\n## 11.12 Summary: Sustainability Through Service, Not Structure\n\n**What We're Not Doing:**\n- Creating elaborate frameworks with detailed budgets, phases, and timelines\n- Imposing hierarchical \"master trainer\" certification systems\n- Building parallel structures that compete with what already exists\n- Prescribing every detail of future events and programs\n\n**What We're Trusting:**\n- People will keep meeting if gatherings genuinely serve them\n- Quality trainers will naturally emerge and be recognized by peers\n- Mosul Space's Climate Space provides natural home for community\n- Institutional anchors (universities, unions) provide stability without rigidity\n- Market will reveal which funding models work\n- Government subsidy advocacy is long-term play worth pursuing\n\n**The Core Bet:**\nWhen training genuinely helps people start businesses, get jobs, improve their communities, and serve their values—they'll find ways to keep it going. Our job isn't to engineer sustainability through correct structures. Our job is to create conditions for something alive to emerge, then get out of the way.\n\n**Sustainability isn't a plan. It's what happens when people find something worth sustaining.**\n\n---\n\n## 11.13 Five-Year Vision (If Things Go Well)\n\n| Year | What Emerges | Community Mechanisms |\n|------|--------------|---------------------|\n| **2025** | ✅ Mosul ToT pilot (39 trainers)<br>✅ WhatsApp groups active<br>✅ Climate Space integration begins | Monthly Climate Space gatherings<br>30-day post-training reunions |\n| **2026** | • Anbar & Baghdad expansions (if funded)<br>• Annual showcase event (if feasible)<br>• Simple trainer directory live<br>• University partnerships formalized | Bi-annual larger gatherings<br>Digital directory Phase 1<br>Government subsidy advocacy begins |\n| **2027** | • Quality assurance system operating<br>• Some employer-sponsored cohorts<br>• University-embedded ToT pilots<br>• 150-200 trainers total (if demand exists) | Peer review systems<br>Natural mentorship networks<br>Regular curriculum updates |\n| **2028+** | • Government subsidy expansion (if advocacy succeeds)<br>• Self-sustaining through mixed funding<br>• Regional replication (Kurdistan, Basra)<br>• National green housing community | Continuous improvement cycles<br>Alumni network operates organically<br>Market-driven training demand |\n\n**Key Principle:** Each phase only happens if previous phase is healthy.

              "json_block": "{\"language\": \"markdown\", \"code\": \"# 11) Sustainability Plan: Creating Conditions for Community to Emerge\\n\\n## 11.1 Vision for Continuity\\n\\nThe ToT sessions (Sept-Oct 2025) are seeds, not solutions. Real sustainability happens when something serves people well enough that they naturally keep it going\\u2014when it becomes woven into how the community already works.\\n\\n**Guiding Principle** (from trainer discussions):\\n*\\\"Actions by their intentions\\\"* \\u2014 This work is framed as an act of service, not just a job. Trainers are motivated by helping Mosul rebuild, reducing energy poverty, and protecting the environment. Sustainability comes from honoring this intrinsic motivation while creating the minimal structure needed for genuine connection to flourish.\\n\\n## 11.2 Building on What Already Works: Climate Space Integration\\n\\n**The Reality Check:**\\nMosul Space already runs \\\"Climate Space\\\" \\u2014 monthly sessions where people gather to talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and activate community. This is working. It's organic. People show up because it serves them.\\n\\n**What This Means for Green Housing Training:**\\nRather than building parallel structures, we connect to and strengthen what's already happening:\\n\\n- **Monthly Climate Space gatherings** become the natural home for trainer check-ins, troubleshooting sessions, and sharing real project experiences\\n- **Existing social capital** at Mosul Space becomes the connective tissue for the green housing community\\n- **Natural rhythm** of monthly touchpoints creates accountability without bureaucracy\\n\\n**Integration Approach:**\\n- Add \\\"Green Housing Update\\\" segment to existing Climate Space sessions (30 minutes/month)\\n- Use this time for trainers to share what's working, what's stuck, and what help they need\\n- Create organic mentorship connections through these gatherings\\n- Let relationships form naturally rather than assigning \\\"master trainers\\\"\\n\\n## 11.3 The Master Trainer Question: Quality Through Connection, Not Hierarchy\\n\\n**What We're Not Doing:**\\nCreating formal \\\"master trainer\\\" certifications and hierarchical training cascades. That feels imposed and rigid.\\n\\n**What Emerges Instead:**\\nSome trainers naturally become go-to resources because they:\\n- Deliver excellent training and their participants succeed\\n- Show up consistently to community gatherings\\n- Are generous with their time and knowledge\\n- Have institutional anchors (university positions, established companies)\\n\\n**Preliminary candidates** who have already demonstrated these qualities organically:\\n\\n| Name | Module | Natural Strengths | Institutional Connection |\\n|------|--------|------------------|-------------------------|\\n| Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel | Solar | University faculty, strong technical depth | University of Mosul |\\n| Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | Solar | Company owner, practical experience | Aqtab Al-Taqa (solar company) |\\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | Passionate about hands-on learning, architect | Al-Rafedyen Architects |\\n| Wifaq Ahmed | Insulation/Heritage | Government subsidy knowledge, heritage expertise | Mosul Heritage Foundation |\\n| Saad Salih Dhiab | Insulation | University faculty, willing to host field visits | Al-Noor University |\\n\\n**How This Works:**\\n- These trainers naturally attract more trainees and mentees\\n- They get invited to co-facilitate future ToT sessions (if they want to)\\n- Mosul Space/ITC can offer modest stipends for their time, but motivation is intrinsic\\n- No formal \\\"master trainer\\\" title or obligation\\u2014just recognition and support for those already leading\\n\\n## 11.4 Events as Touchpoints: Creating Rhythm Without Rigidity\\n\\n**The Pattern:**\\nPeople need rhythm to stay connected, but not so much structure that it becomes burdensome.\\n\\n### One Major Annual Event: Green Housing Showcase\\n**Concept:** Bring together trainers, graduates, employers, suppliers, policymakers for a 1-day celebration and connection event.\\n\\n**Timing:** Piggyback on Output 3.2 Design Competition Finale (2026) rather than creating separate event.\\n\\n**Core Elements:**\\n- Portfolio showcase (graduates present before/after projects)\\n- Design competition finale (architecture module)\\n- Informal jobs fair (employers meet candidates)\\n- Supplier expo (materials companies display products)\\n- Awards and recognition (best retrofit impact, most innovative design, etc.)\\n\\n**Important:** This is a *suggestion* for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not a detailed prescription. If it's not feasible or doesn't feel right, that's fine. The community will find its own ways to celebrate and connect.\\n\\n### Monthly Climate Space Gatherings\\n**What Happens:**\\n- Green Housing update segment (30 min)\\n- Trainers share project stories, challenges, wins\\n- Problem-solving clinic (\\\"I'm stuck on X, anyone dealt with this?\\\")\\n- Social connection over tea\\n\\n**Why This Works:**\\n- Already happening\\u2014no new infrastructure needed\\n- Low commitment (monthly, not weekly)\\n- Flexible format (sometimes documentary, sometimes discussion, sometimes hands-on demo)\\n- Builds trust and relationships over time\\n\\n### Post-Training 30-Day Reunion\\n**Purpose:** Check in one month after each training cohort completes to see who's implementing what they learned.\\n\\n**Format:**\\n- 2-hour gathering (in-person or Zoom)\\n- \\\"Show & tell\\\" \\u2014 participants share portfolio pieces, installations, designs\\n- Accountability without pressure\\n- Connect successful graduates with employers/clients looking for talent\\n\\n## 11.5 Digital Infrastructure: A Living Directory, Not a Static Database\\n\\n**The Need:**\\nAs the community grows, people need ways to find each other\\u2014trainers looking for apprentices, clients looking for consultants, graduates looking for mentors, suppliers looking for installers.\\n\\n**Phase 1 (2026): Simple Trainer Directory**\\n- Platform: Airtable or Google Sheets (accessible, no coding required)\\n- Content:\\n  - Trainer profiles (name, module, location, contact)\\n  - Participant portfolios (photos, testimonials, project descriptions)\\n  - Supplier list (materials, pricing, contact info)\\n- Access: Public link, searchable by module/location\\n- Maintenance: Mosul Space staff updates quarterly\\n\\n**Phase 2 (2027+): Quality Assurance Through Community Review**\\n**The Challenge:** How do you maintain quality without formal audits?\\n\\n**Approach:**\\n- Graduates can review their training experience (anonymous or signed)\\n- Clients can review completed projects (with verification)\\n- Peer feedback system where trainers review each other's materials\\n- Double-blind quality checks by independent assessors (nonprofit or university)\\n\\n**Goal:** Create trusted signal in a market where CVs aren't trusted and cheap fraudulent work has damaged solar's reputation. Make quality visible and verifiable.\\n\\n**Note on RAG/AI System:** A more sophisticated AI-powered knowledge base (querying all transcripts, materials, case studies) is possible in future phases but not essential now. Start simple, add complexity only if needed.\\n\\n## 11.6 Funding Sustainability: Possibilities, Not Prescriptions\\n\\n**Current Reality:**\\nITC funding supports initial ToT cohorts. What happens next?\\n\\n**Potential Funding Sources** (not requirements, just options to explore):\\n\\n1. **Employer-Sponsored Training**\\n   - Solar companies send staff to ToT, pay training fee\\n   - Already happening informally (companies sent employees to Oct ToT)\\n   - Could formalize with ~50,000-100,000 IQD/participant fee\\n\\n2. **University Partnerships**\\n   - Embed ToT into university continuing education programs\\n   - Universities provide venue, reducing costs\\n   - Dr. Abdulhakim (University of Mosul) and Saad Salih (Al-Noor University) expressed interest\\n   - University certification adds credibility\\n\\n3. **Participant Fees (Sliding Scale)**\\n   - Those who can afford to pay do (50,000 IQD)\\n   - Those who can't, receive scholarships\\n   - Revenue helps offset costs, but not required\\n\\n4. **Grant Funding**\\n   - UNDP, GIZ, other development agencies value green skills training\\n   - ITC/Mosul Space can apply for follow-on grants\\n   - Strong track record from initial cohorts helps with future fundraising\\n\\n5. **Government Subsidy (Long-Term Advocacy)**\\n   - Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials (cement, rebar)\\n   - Potential to expand subsidy to include insulation materials\\n   - Would dramatically increase market demand \\u2192 more jobs for graduates\\n   - Requires 2-3 year advocacy campaign (see Section 11.8)\\n\\n**Break-Even Is Not the Goal:**\\nThe goal is value creation. If training genuinely helps people start businesses, get jobs, and improve their communities, funding will follow. The market will reveal which models work.\\n\\n## 11.7 Institutional Anchors: Where to Root This Work\\n\\nTo avoid \\\"hero-dependent\\\" sustainability (where everything collapses if one person leaves), root the work in institutions that will outlast individuals:\\n\\n### Anchor 1: Mosul Space (Convening Power)\\n- Hosts Climate Space gatherings\\n- Manages WhatsApp community groups\\n- Coordinates logistics for events\\n- Stable organization with diverse funding\\n\\n### Anchor 2: University of Mosul (Academic Credibility)\\n- Partnership with Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel (solar)\\n- Could embed ToT in continuing education\\n- Access to facilities (classrooms, labs)\\n- Long-term institutional stability\\n\\n### Anchor 3: Al-Noor University (Field Experience Hub)\\n- Saad Salih Dhiab willing to host field visits\\n- Offered formal partnership relationship\\n- Can provide training venues\\n\\n### Anchor 4: Iraqi Engineering Union (Professional Recognition)\\n- Potential to recognize ToT as professional development credit\\n- Engineers need continuing education for licensure\\n- Would increase participation and credibility\\n\\n**Next Step:** Draft simple MoUs (1-2 pages max) clarifying roles, not creating bureaucracy.\\n\\n## 11.8 Government Subsidy Advocacy: High-Impact Leverage Point\\n\\n**The Opportunity** (from Wifaq Ahmed, Mosul Heritage Foundation):\\n\\nIraqi government already subsidizes construction materials\\u2014homeowners get money back when buying cement and rebar. **What if this subsidy expanded to include insulation materials?**\\n\\n**Why This Matters:**\\n- Current barrier: Insulation seen as \\\"luxury,\\\" not essential\\n- With subsidy covering 30-50% of cost, ROI improves from 3-4 years to 1.5-2 years\\n- Mass adoption becomes economically feasible\\n- Existing policy framework means expansion is politically realistic (not creating new program)\\n\\n**Advocacy Strategy** (Long-Term, 2-3 Years):\\n\\n1. **Document the case** (by Dec 2025)\\n   - Compile ToT graduate case studies (energy savings, health benefits, comfort)\\n   - Calculate: \\\"If government subsidized insulation \\u2192 X households could afford it \\u2192 Y jobs created \\u2192 Z reduction in fuel imports\\\"\\n\\n2. **Build coalition**\\n   - University of Mosul (academic credibility)\\n   - Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement)\\n   - Private sector suppliers (SIKA, SMTC benefit \\u2192 will lobby)\\n   - ITC (international reputation, economic development expertise)\\n\\n3. **Pilot demonstration** (2026)\\n   - Retrofit 10-20 homes with insulation (ITC/UNDP funded)\\n   - Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials\\n   - Invite government officials to site visit at annual showcase event\\n\\n4. **Submit policy brief** (2026)\\n   - ITC submits formal recommendation to Ministry of Construction & Housing\\n   - Key message: \\\"Subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, improves climate resilience\\u2014achievable by adding 5 items to existing subsidy list\\\"\\n\\n**ITC Role:** Leverage existing government relationships, provide technical analysis, coordinate coalition. This is long-term work but transformational if successful.\\n\\n## 11.9 Continuous Improvement: Learning From What Actually Happens\\n\\n**The Feedback Loop:**\\n\\n1. **Post-Training Surveys** (1 week after ToT)\\n   - \\\"What worked? What needs improvement? Are you ready to train?\\\"\\n   - Already implemented (see feedback forms)\\n   - Key findings inform next cohort\\n\\n2. **30-Day Reunion Check-Ins**\\n   - \\\"Did you deliver your first training? What challenges? What resources needed?\\\"\\n   - Real-world implementation reveals curriculum gaps\\n\\n3. **Monthly Climate Space Discussions**\\n   - Organic feedback emerges through regular gatherings\\n   - \\\"Participants keep asking about X\\u2014should we add it to curriculum?\\\"\\n\\n4. **Employer Feedback** (from apprenticeship partners)\\n   - \\\"Are graduates showing up with skills we need? What's missing?\\\"\\n   - Closes loop between training content and market needs\\n\\n5. **Annual Curriculum Review**\\n   - Once/year, trainers gather to update materials\\n   - Add new technologies, remove outdated content\\n   - Based on actual field experience, not speculation\\n\\n**Example of Adaptation:**\\nIf multiple trainers report \\\"participants struggle with U-value calculations\\\" \\u2192 add visual decision tree, worked examples, practice problems \\u2192 test in next cohort \\u2192 assess if it helped \\u2192 keep if yes, iterate if no.\\n\\n## 11.10 What Role Does ITC Play Going Forward?\\n\\n**Short-Term (2025-2026):**\\n- Fund initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad\\n- Support annual showcase event (if feasible)\\n- Develop digital trainer directory (Phase 1)\\n- Facilitate university partnerships\\n\\n**Medium-Term (2026-2027):**\\n- Transition coordination to Mosul Space\\n- Support government subsidy advocacy campaign\\n- Co-develop quality assurance systems\\n- Document case studies for replication in other regions\\n\\n**Long-Term (2027+):**\\n- Periodic check-ins, not daily management\\n- Available for troubleshooting, but not driving\\n- Share model with other Iraqi cities or conflict-affected regions\\n- Let community own and evolve the work\\n\\n**Bilal's Continuing Role:**\\n- Interviewing and synthesizing expert insights (when needed for expansions)\\n- Co-facilitating ToT sessions (especially enjoyable)\\n- Building and maintaining digital infrastructure\\n- Developing quality assurance and review systems\\n\\n## 11.11 Scaling Strategy: If (And Only If) It's Working\\n\\n**Phase 1 (2025): Mosul Pilot** \\u2705 COMPLETE\\n- 39 trainers across Solar, Insulation, Architecture\\n- 3 ToT sessions delivered (Sept, Oct 2025)\\n\\n**Phase 2 (2026): Expansion to Anbar & Baghdad** (If Mosul model proves valuable)\\n- Trainers from Mosul co-facilitate ToT in other governorates\\n- Local partners identified (universities, NGOs) to host\\n- Curriculum adapted for regional differences (climate, energy tariffs, market conditions)\\n- Target: 60 additional trainers (20 per governorate)\\n\\n**Phase 3 (2027-2028): National Reach** (If demand emerges organically)\\n- Formalize certification: \\\"ITC Certified Green Housing Trainer\\\"\\n- Partner with Iraqi Engineering Union for professional recognition\\n- Original trainers become regional ToT facilitators (if they want to)\\n- Target: 200+ trainers nationwide\\n\\n**Important:** Scaling happens **only if** the community is healthy and trainers are succeeding.

[View your revised Section 11](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Section_11_Sustainability_Plan_Revised.md)\n\n## What Changed and Why\n\n**Major Shifts in Approach:**\n\n1. **From prescriptive to emergent**: Removed detailed break-even analyses, rigid phase structures, and over-engineered frameworks. Instead, focused on creating conditions for organic growth.\n\n2. **Climate Space integration**: Made Mosul Space's existing monthly gatherings the *foundation* rather than creating parallel structures. This honors what's already working.\n\n3. **Master trainers reconceived**: Changed from formal certification hierarchy to natural recognition of trainers who are already leading through quality and generosity.\n\n4. **Events simplified**: Annual showcase is now a *suggestion* to piggyback on the 3.2 Design Competition, not a detailed prescription. Monthly touchpoints through existing Climate Space rhythm.\n\n5. **Financial sustainability**: Removed break-even math and cost-per-cohort calculations. Instead, listed potential funding sources as possibilities to explore, emphasizing \"value creation attracts funding\" over \"engineer sustainability through correct structures.\"\n\n6. **Digital platform**: Kept the vision but simplified Phase 1 to Airtable/Google Sheets. Quality assurance through community review and double-blind verification, addressing the \"CVs aren't trusted\" insight from solar partners.\n\n7. **Your role**: Explicitly named your continuing involvement in interviews, ToT facilitation, and digital infrastructure—the parts you actually enjoy and want to do.\n\n8. **Tone shift**: From consultant-speak (\"implement the following mechanisms\") to authentic voice (\"this is a suggestion, see what emerges\"). Trusts the community to figure out what works.\n\n9. **Key insights integrated**: \n   - Government subsidy advocacy (from Wifaq)\n   - Quality crisis in solar market (from Ali Abkan interviews)\n   - University partnerships (from Saad Salih, Abdulhakim)\n   - Need for practical field visits (from ToT feedback)\n\n**What Got Cut:**\n- Detailed budgets and cost breakdowns\n- Rigid 5-year phase timelines with prescribed milestones\n- Elaborate festival planning (kept concept, removed implementation details)\n- Over-engineered RAG system details\n- Bureaucratic MoU specifications\n\n**What Got Added:**\n- Honest framing: \"sustainability through service, not structure\"\n- Trust in emergence over engineering\n- Integration with what already exists\n- Quality assurance addressing market trust crisis\n- Your authentic vision about mutually beneficial community\n\n**Core Philosophy:** \"Sustainability isn't a plan. It's what happens when people find something worth sustaining.\"",

The ideas here come from listening to trainers during the ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, interviewing solar and insulation experts, and thinking about what Mosul Space is already doing through their Climate Space initiative.\n\nThe recommendations try to balance two things: creating enough structure that people can find each other and connect, while avoiding so much structure that it becomes burdensome or feels imposed from outside. Throughout the interviews, trainers emphasized that this work is motivated by service—helping Mosul rebuild, reducing energy poverty, protecting the environment. Any sustainability approach needs to honor that intrinsic motivation rather than replace it with elaborate frameworks.\n\nThe ToT sessions are really just a beginning. What happens next depends on whether the training genuinely helps people start businesses, get jobs, and serve their communities. If it does, they'll find ways to keep it going. These recommendations are offered as possibilities to consider, not as prescriptions to follow.\n\n## 11.1 Vision for Continuity\n\nReal sustainability probably happens when something serves people well enough that they naturally want to keep it going—when it becomes woven into how the community already operates rather than existing as a separate project.\n\nFrom trainer discussions, a guiding principle emerged: \"Actions by their intentions.\" This work is framed as an act of service, not just employment. Trainers talked about wanting to help Mosul rebuild, to reduce energy poverty, to protect the environment. Sustainability approaches might work better if they honor this intrinsic motivation while providing practical support where needed.",

This is actually already happening informally—companies sent employees to the October ToT. It might be worth formalizing with a fee structure (maybe 50,000-100,000 IQD per participant).\n\nUniversity partnerships: If ToT becomes embedded in university continuing education programs, universities could provide venues (reducing costs) and their certification would add credibility. Dr. Abdulhakim at University of Mosul and Saad Salih at Al-Noor University both expressed interest in this direction.\n\nParticipant fees on a sliding scale: Those who can afford to contribute could pay (around 50,000 IQD), while others receive scholarships. Revenue would help offset costs without being required for participation.\n\nGrant funding: Development agencies like UNDP and GIZ often support green skills training. A strong track record from the initial cohorts would help with future fundraising applications.\n\nGovernment subsidy (longer-term advocacy): The Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials like cement and rebar. There might be potential to expand this to include insulation materials, which would dramatically increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates. This would require a 2-3 year advocacy campaign (discussed more in Section 11.8).\n\nRather than trying to engineer a break-even model, it might make more sense to focus on value creation.

She suggested exploring whether this subsidy could expand to include insulation materials.\n\nThis matters because currently insulation is seen as a luxury rather than essential. If a government subsidy covered 30-50% of insulation costs, the return on investment would improve from 3-4 years to maybe 1.5-2 years. Mass adoption would become economically feasible. And since the policy framework already exists, expansion might be politically realistic—it's not about creating a new program, just adding items to an existing list.\n\nA possible advocacy approach (understanding this would take 2-3 years):\n\nDocument the case by compiling ToT graduate case studies showing energy savings, health benefits, and comfort improvements. Calculate the broader impacts: if government subsidized insulation, how many more households could afford it, how many jobs would be created, how much reduction in fuel imports.\n\nBuild a coalition including University of Mosul (academic credibility), Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement), private sector suppliers like SIKA and SMTC (who would benefit and might lobby), and ITC (international reputation and economic development expertise).\n\nRun a pilot demonstration retrofitting 10-20 homes with insulation using ITC or UNDP funding. Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials. Invite government officials to site visits, perhaps at the annual showcase event.\n\nSubmit a policy brief to the Ministry of Construction and Housing emphasizing that subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, and improves climate resilience—achievable by adding just a few items to an existing subsidy list.\n\nITC's role could be leveraging existing government relationships, providing technical analysis, and helping coordinate the coalition. This is definitely long-term work, but potentially transformational if it succeeds.",

Trainers from Mosul might co-facilitate ToT in other governorates. Local partners (universities, NGOs) would need to be identified to host. The curriculum would probably need adaptation for regional differences in climate, energy tariffs, and market conditions. A possible target would be 60 additional trainers (around 20 per governorate).\n\nPhase 3 (2027-2028): If demand emerges organically and the community stays healthy, there could be national reach. This might involve formalizing certification (something like \"ITC Certified Green Housing Trainer\"), partnering with the Iraqi Engineering Union for professional recognition, and having original trainers become regional ToT facilitators if they're interested.

The suggestions lean toward creating minimal structure—just enough for people to find each other and connect—while trusting that if the training genuinely serves people, they'll figure out how to keep it going.\n\nA few core ideas run through these recommendations:\n\nConnect with what already exists rather than building parallel structures. Mosul Space's Climate Space gatherings are already working, so it makes sense to build on that rather than starting from scratch.\n\nRecognize natural leadership rather than creating formal hierarchies. Some trainers will naturally become go-to resources through the quality of their work and their generosity with time and knowledge.\n\nCreate rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep the format flexible so it can adapt to what people actually need.\n\nBuild simple digital infrastructure that could evolve over time based on what proves useful.\n\nExplore multiple funding possibilities without trying to engineer a perfect break-even model. If the training creates genuine value, funding sources will probably emerge.\n\nRoot the work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend entirely on specific individuals.\n\nConsider longer-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion, understanding this would take years but could be transformational.\n\nKeep learning from what actually happens through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews.\n\nScale only if the community is healthy and trainers are succeeding. Quality and authenticity matter more than growth.\n\nThe ToT sessions completed in September and October 2025 are really just a beginning. What happens next depends on whether they genuinely help people start businesses, get jobs, and serve their communities. These recommendations are offered as possibilities for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not as prescriptions to follow. The community will ultimately figure out what works for them.",

The ideas here come from listening to trainers during the ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, interviewing solar and insulation experts, and thinking about what Mosul Space is already doing through their Climate Space initiative.\n     6\t\n     7\tThe recommendations try to balance two things: creating enough structure that people can find each other and connect, while avoiding so much structure that it becomes burdensome or feels imposed from outside. Throughout the interviews, trainers emphasized that this work is motivated by service—helping Mosul rebuild, reducing energy poverty, protecting the environment. Any sustainability approach needs to honor that intrinsic motivation rather than replace it with elaborate frameworks.\n     8\t\n     9\tThe ToT sessions are really just a beginning. What happens next depends on whether the training genuinely helps people start businesses, get jobs, and serve their communities. If it does, they'll find ways to keep it going. These recommendations are offered as possibilities to consider, not as prescriptions to follow.\n    10\t\n    11\t## 11.1 Vision for Continuity\n    12\t\n    13\tReal sustainability probably happens when something serves people well enough that they naturally want to keep it going—when it becomes woven into how the community already operates rather than existing as a separate project.\n    14\t\n    15\tFrom trainer discussions, a guiding principle emerged: \"Actions by their intentions.\" This work is framed as an act of service, not just employment. Trainers talked about wanting to help Mosul rebuild, to reduce energy poverty, to protect the environment. Sustainability approaches might work better if they honor this intrinsic motivation while providing practical support where needed.\n    16\t\n    17\t## 11.2 Connecting with Climate Space\n    18\t\n    19\tMosul Space already runs monthly Climate Space gatherings where people talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and build community. From what I understand, people show up because these sessions genuinely serve them—they're organic rather than obligatory.\n    20\t\n    21\tIt might make sense to connect the green housing training community to these existing gatherings rather than creating separate structures. Some possibilities:\n    22\t\n    23\t- Add a \"Green Housing Update\" segment to Climate Space sessions (maybe 30 minutes per month)\n    24\t- Use this time for trainers to share what's working, what challenges they're facing, and what help they need\n    25\t- Let mentorship connections form naturally through regular gatherings\n    26\t- Allow relationships to develop organically rather than assigning formal roles\n    27\t\n    28\tThis approach would leverage the social capital and rhythm that already exists at Mosul Space. The monthly touchpoints could create accountability without feeling bureaucratic.\n    29\t\n    30\t## 11.3 Recognizing Natural Leadership Rather Than Creating Hierarchy\n    31\t\n    32\tInstead of creating formal \"master trainer\" certifications, it might be worth recognizing that some trainers will naturally emerge as go-to resources. This seems to happen when people consistently deliver excellent training, show up to community gatherings, are generous with their time and knowledge, and have stable institutional connections.\n    33\t\n    34\tA few trainers have already demonstrated these qualities during the initial ToT sessions:\n    35\t\n    36\t| Name | Module | Observed Strengths | Institutional Connection |\n    37\t|------|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n    38\t| Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel | Solar | University faculty, strong technical depth | University of Mosul |\n    39\t| Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | Solar | Company owner, practical experience | Aqtab Al-Taqa (solar company) |\n    40\t| Omar Laith | Insulation | Passionate about hands-on learning, architect | Al-Rafedyen Architects |\n    41\t| Wifaq Ahmed | Insulation/Heritage | Government subsidy knowledge, heritage expertise | Mosul Heritage Foundation |\n    42\t| Saad Salih Dhiab | Insulation | University faculty, willing to host field visits | Al-Noor University |\n    43\t\n    44\tRather than formalizing this, these trainers could simply be invited to co-facilitate future ToT sessions if they're interested. Mosul Space or ITC might offer modest stipends for their time, but the motivation seems to be intrinsic rather than financial. No formal title or obligation—just recognition and support for those already leading naturally.\n    45\t\n    46\t## 11.4 Creating Rhythm Through Events\n    47\t\n    48\tPeople probably need some rhythm to stay connected—not so much structure that it becomes burdensome, but enough touchpoints that relationships can develop over time.\n    49\t\n    50\tOne possibility for a major annual event: Green Housing Showcase\n    51\t\n    52\tThis could bring together trainers, graduates, employers, suppliers, and policymakers for a day of celebration and connection.

The ideas here come from listening to trainers during the ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, interviewing solar and insulation experts, and thinking about what Mosul Space is already doing through their Climate Space initiative.\\n\\nThe recommendations try to balance two things: creating enough structure that people can find each other and connect, while avoiding so much structure that it becomes burdensome or feels imposed from outside. Throughout the interviews, trainers emphasized that this work is motivated by service\\u2014helping Mosul rebuild, reducing energy poverty, protecting the environment. Any sustainability approach needs to honor that intrinsic motivation rather than replace it with elaborate frameworks.\\n\\nThe ToT sessions are really just a beginning. What happens next depends on whether the training genuinely helps people start businesses, get jobs, and serve their communities. If it does, they'll find ways to keep it going. These recommendations are offered as possibilities to consider, not as prescriptions to follow.\\n\\n## 11.1 Vision for Continuity\\n\\nReal sustainability probably happens when something serves people well enough that they naturally want to keep it going\\u2014when it becomes woven into how the community already operates rather than existing as a separate project.\\n\\nFrom trainer discussions, a guiding principle emerged: \\\"Actions by their intentions.\\\" This work is framed as an act of service, not just employment. Trainers talked about wanting to help Mosul rebuild, to reduce energy poverty, to protect the environment. Sustainability approaches might work better if they honor this intrinsic motivation while providing practical support where needed.\\n\\n## 11.2 Connecting with Climate Space\\n\\nMosul Space already runs monthly Climate Space gatherings where people talk about sustainability, watch documentaries, and build community. From what I understand, people show up because these sessions genuinely serve them\\u2014they're organic rather than obligatory.\\n\\nIt might make sense to connect the green housing training community to these existing gatherings rather than creating separate structures. Some possibilities:\\n\\n- Add a \\\"Green Housing Update\\\" segment to Climate Space sessions (maybe 30 minutes per month)\\n- Use this time for trainers to share what's working, what challenges they're facing, and what help they need\\n- Let mentorship connections form naturally through regular gatherings\\n- Allow relationships to develop organically rather than assigning formal roles\\n\\nThis approach would leverage the social capital and rhythm that already exists at Mosul Space. The monthly touchpoints could create accountability without feeling bureaucratic.\\n\\n## 11.3 Recognizing Natural Leadership Rather Than Creating Hierarchy\\n\\nInstead of creating formal \\\"master trainer\\\" certifications, it might be worth recognizing that some trainers will naturally emerge as go-to resources. This seems to happen when people consistently deliver excellent training, show up to community gatherings, are generous with their time and knowledge, and have stable institutional connections.\\n\\nA few trainers have already demonstrated these qualities during the initial ToT sessions:\\n\\n| Name | Module | Observed Strengths | Institutional Connection |\\n|------|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|\\n| Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel | Solar | University faculty, strong technical depth | University of Mosul |\\n| Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | Solar | Company owner, practical experience | Aqtab Al-Taqa (solar company) |\\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | Passionate about hands-on learning, architect | Al-Rafedyen Architects |\\n| Wifaq Ahmed | Insulation/Heritage | Government subsidy knowledge, heritage expertise | Mosul Heritage Foundation |\\n| Saad Salih Dhiab | Insulation | University faculty, willing to host field visits | Al-Noor University |\\n\\nRather than formalizing this, these trainers could simply be invited to co-facilitate future ToT sessions if they're interested. Mosul Space or ITC might offer modest stipends for their time, but the motivation seems to be intrinsic rather than financial. No formal title or obligation\\u2014just recognition and support for those already leading naturally.\\n\\n## 11.4 Creating Rhythm Through Events\\n\\nPeople probably need some rhythm to stay connected\\u2014not so much structure that it becomes burdensome, but enough touchpoints that relationships can develop over time.\\n\\nOne possibility for a major annual event: Green Housing Showcase\\n\\nThis could bring together trainers, graduates, employers, suppliers, and policymakers for a day of celebration and connection. Some elements that might work:\\n- Portfolio showcase (graduates present before/after projects)\\n- Design competition finale (architecture module)\\n- Informal jobs fair (employers meet candidates)\\n- Supplier expo (materials companies display products)\\n- Awards and recognition (best retrofit impact, most innovative design)\\n\\nOne practical approach would be to combine this with the Output 3.2 Design Competition Finale planned for 2026 rather than creating a separate event. This would reduce costs and complexity while still creating a meaningful gathering.\\n\\nThat said, this is really just a suggestion for ITC and Mosul Space to consider. If it doesn't feel feasible or doesn't fit with what's already planned, that's completely fine. The community will probably find its own ways to celebrate and connect.\\n\\nFor monthly touchpoints, the Climate Space gatherings could serve this purpose:\\n- Green Housing update segment (around 30 minutes)\\n- Trainers share project stories, challenges, successes\\n- Problem-solving clinic for stuck situations\\n- Social connection over tea\\n\\nThe format could stay flexible\\u2014sometimes a documentary, sometimes discussion, sometimes a hands-on demonstration. The goal is building trust and relationships over time rather than checking boxes.\\n\\nPost-training 30-day reunions might also help with accountability. These could be 2-hour gatherings (in person or Zoom) where participants share what they've implemented since training. The \\\"show and tell\\\" format seems to work well\\u2014people bring photos, describe challenges, and get support. It also creates a natural opportunity to connect successful graduates with employers or clients looking for talent.\\n\\n## 11.5 Digital Infrastructure: Simple Directories That Could Evolve\\n\\nAs the community grows, people will probably need ways to find each other\\u2014trainers looking for apprentices, clients looking for consultants, graduates looking for mentors, suppliers looking for installers.\\n\\nA simple starting point might be a trainer directory using Airtable or Google Sheets. Nothing fancy, just:\\n- Trainer profiles (name, module, location, contact information)\\n- Participant portfolios (photos, testimonials, project descriptions)\\n- Supplier list (materials, pricing, contact information)\\n\\nThis could be publicly accessible and searchable by module or location. Mosul Space staff could update it quarterly or as needed.\\n\\nThe trickier question is quality assurance. In the solar market especially, there's a trust crisis\\u2014CVs aren't reliable, and cheap fraudulent work has damaged the industry's reputation. Some possible approaches:\\n- Graduates review their training experience (anonymous or signed)\\n- Clients review completed projects (with some verification process)\\n- Peer feedback where trainers review each other's materials\\n- Independent quality checks by nonprofit or university assessors\\n\\nThe goal would be creating trusted signals in a market where they're currently lacking.

This is actually already happening informally—companies sent employees to the October ToT. It might be worth formalizing with a fee structure (maybe 50,000-100,000 IQD per participant).\n   101\t\n   102\tUniversity partnerships: If ToT becomes embedded in university continuing education programs, universities could provide venues (reducing costs) and their certification would add credibility. Dr. Abdulhakim at University of Mosul and Saad Salih at Al-Noor University both expressed interest in this direction.\n   103\t\n   104\tParticipant fees on a sliding scale: Those who can afford to contribute could pay (around 50,000 IQD), while others receive scholarships. Revenue would help offset costs without being required for participation.\n   105\t\n   106\tGrant funding: Development agencies like UNDP and GIZ often support green skills training. A strong track record from the initial cohorts would help with future fundraising applications.\n   107\t\n   108\tGovernment subsidy (longer-term advocacy): The Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials like cement and rebar. There might be potential to expand this to include insulation materials, which would dramatically increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates. This would require a 2-3 year advocacy campaign (discussed more in Section 11.8).\n   109\t\n   110\tRather than trying to engineer a break-even model, it might make more sense to focus on value creation. If the training genuinely helps people start businesses, get jobs, and improve their communities, funding sources will probably emerge. The market will reveal which models actually work.\n   111\t\n   112\t## 11.7 Rooting the Work in Institutions\n   113\t\n   114\tTo avoid everything depending on one or two individuals, it helps to root the work in institutions that will outlast any single person's involvement:\n   115\t\n   116\tMosul Space could provide the convening power—hosting Climate Space gatherings, managing WhatsApp groups, coordinating logistics for events. They're a stable organization with diverse funding sources.\n   117\t\n   118\tUniversity of Mosul offers academic credibility through partnership with Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel. There might be potential to embed ToT in their continuing education program, which would provide access to facilities and long-term institutional stability.\n   119\t\n   120\tAl-Noor University through Saad Salih Dhiab has already offered to host field visits and is interested in a formal partnership. They could provide training venues and practical learning opportunities.\n   121\t\n   122\tIraqi Engineering Union might recognize ToT as professional development credit. Since engineers need continuing education for licensure, this could increase both participation and credibility.\n   123\t\n   124\tSimple memorandums of understanding (maybe 1-2 pages each) could clarify roles without creating unnecessary bureaucracy.\n   125\t\n   126\t## 11.8 Government Subsidy Advocacy: A Longer-Term Possibility\n   127\t\n   128\tDuring interviews, Wifaq Ahmed from Mosul Heritage Foundation mentioned something interesting: the Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials—homeowners can get money back when they buy cement and rebar. She suggested exploring whether this subsidy could expand to include insulation materials.\n   129\t\n   130\tThis matters because currently insulation is seen as a luxury rather than essential. If a government subsidy covered 30-50% of insulation costs, the return on investment would improve from 3-4 years to maybe 1.5-2 years. Mass adoption would become economically feasible. And since the policy framework already exists, expansion might be politically realistic—it's not about creating a new program, just adding items to an existing list.\n   131\t\n   132\tA possible advocacy approach (understanding this would take 2-3 years):\n   133\t\n   134\tDocument the case by compiling ToT graduate case studies showing energy savings, health benefits, and comfort improvements. Calculate the broader impacts: if government subsidized insulation, how many more households could afford it, how many jobs would be created, how much reduction in fuel imports.\n   135\t\n   136\tBuild a coalition including University of Mosul (academic credibility), Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement), private sector suppliers like SIKA and SMTC (who would benefit and might lobby), and ITC (international reputation and economic development expertise).\n   137\t\n   138\tRun a pilot demonstration retrofitting 10-20 homes with insulation using ITC or UNDP funding. Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials. Invite government officials to site visits, perhaps at the annual showcase event.\n   139\t\n   140\tSubmit a policy brief to the Ministry of Construction and Housing emphasizing that subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, and improves climate resilience—achievable by adding just a few items to an existing subsidy list.\n   141\t\n   142\tITC's role could be leveraging existing government relationships, providing technical analysis, and helping coordinate the coalition. This is definitely long-term work, but potentially transformational if it succeeds.\n   143\t\n   144\t## 11.9 Learning From What Actually Happens\n   145\t\n   146\tA few simple feedback mechanisms could help the training evolve based on real experience:\n   147\t\n   148\tPost-training surveys about a week after ToT asking what worked, what needs improvement, and whether trainers feel ready. This is already being done (the feedback forms are attached), and insights from those surveys are already informing the next cohorts.\n   149\t\n   150\t30-day reunion check-ins to see who's actually implementing what they learned and what challenges they're facing. Real-world implementation tends to reveal curriculum gaps that weren't obvious during training.\n   151\t\n   152\tMonthly Climate Space discussions where organic feedback emerges through regular gatherings. When trainers keep hearing \"participants ask about X,\" that might signal something to add to the curriculum.\n   153\t\n   154\tEmployer feedback from apprenticeship partners about whether graduates are showing up with needed skills and what might be missing. This closes the loop between training content and actual market needs.\n   155\t\n   156\tAnnual curriculum reviews where trainers gather once a year to update materials—adding new technologies, removing outdated content, incorporating lessons from the field.\n   157\t\n   158\tAn example of how this could work: if multiple trainers report that participants struggle with U-value calculations, add visual decision trees and worked examples, test in the next cohort, assess whether it helped, keep it if it did or iterate if it didn't.\n   159\t\n   160\t## 11.10 Possible Roles for ITC Going Forward\n   161\t\n   162\tIn the short term (2025-2026), ITC might continue funding initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, and Baghdad, support the annual showcase event if it happens, help develop a simple digital trainer directory, and facilitate university partnerships.\n   163\t\n   164\tMedium-term (2026-2027) could involve transitioning coordination responsibilities to Mosul Space, supporting the government subsidy advocacy campaign if that moves forward, helping develop quality assurance systems, and documenting case studies for potential replication in other regions.\n   165\t\n   166\tLonger-term (2027+), the relationship could shift to periodic check-ins rather than daily management. ITC would be available for troubleshooting but not necessarily driving things. There might be opportunities to share the model with other Iraqi cities or conflict-affected regions, while letting the Mosul community increasingly own and evolve the work.\n   167\t\n   168\tAs for my continuing involvement, I'd be interested in: conducting more expert interviews when needed for expansions, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which have been really enjoyable), building and maintaining digital infrastructure, and developing quality assurance and review systems. But this would depend on funding and what actually makes sense as things develop.\n   169\t\n   170\t## 11.11 Scaling: Only If and When It Makes Sense\n   171\t\n   172\tPhase 1 (2025): Mosul Pilot has been completed with 39 trainers across Solar, Insulation, and Architecture modules in three ToT sessions delivered in September and October 2025.\n   173\t\n   174\tPhase 2 (2026): If the Mosul model proves valuable, expansion to Anbar and Baghdad could make sense. Trainers from Mosul might co-facilitate ToT in other governorates. Local partners (universities, NGOs) would need to be identified to host. The curriculum would probably need adaptation for regional differences in climate, energy tariffs, and market conditions. A possible target would be 60 additional trainers (around 20 per governorate).\n   175\t\n   176\tPhase 3 (2027-2028): If demand emerges organically and the community stays healthy, there could be national reach. This might involve formalizing certification (something like \"ITC Certified Green Housing Trainer\"), partnering with the Iraqi Engineering Union for professional recognition, and having original trainers become regional ToT facilitators if they're interested. A very rough target might be 200+ trainers nationwide.\n   177\t\n   178\tThe key principle is that scaling should only happen if the community is healthy and trainers are genuinely succeeding. Growth for its own sake tends to kill what makes something work. Quality and authenticity need to come first, with scale following only if it makes sense.\n   179\t\n   180\t## Conclusion\n   181\t\n   182\tThese recommendations try to honor what emerged from listening to trainers, reviewing feedback, and thinking about how communities actually sustain themselves. The suggestions lean toward creating minimal structure—just enough for people to find each other and connect—while trusting that if the training genuinely serves people, they'll figure out how to keep it going.\n   183\t\n   184\tA few core ideas run through these recommendations:\n   185\t\n   186\tConnect with what already exists rather than building parallel structures. Mosul Space's Climate Space gatherings are already working, so it makes sense to build on that rather than starting from scratch.\n   187\t\n   188\tRecognize natural leadership rather than creating formal hierarchies. Some trainers will naturally become go-to resources through the quality of their work and their generosity with time and knowledge.\n   189\t\n   190\tCreate rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep the format flexible so it can adapt to what people actually need.\n   191\t\n   192\tBuild simple digital infrastructure that could evolve over time based on what proves useful.\n   193\t\n   194\tExplore multiple funding possibilities without trying to engineer a perfect break-even model. If the training creates genuine value, funding sources will probably emerge.\n   195\t\n   196\tRoot the work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend entirely on specific individuals.\n   197\t\n   198\tConsider longer-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion, understanding this would take years but could be transformational.\n   199\t\n   200\tKeep learning from what actually happens through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews.\n   201\t\n   202\tScale only if the community is healthy and trainers are succeeding. Quality and authenticity matter more than growth.\n   203\t\n   204\tThe ToT sessions completed in September and October 2025 are really just a beginning. What happens next depends on whether they genuinely help people start businesses, get jobs, and serve their communities. These recommendations are offered as possibilities for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not as prescriptions to follow. The community will ultimately figure out what works for them.\n   205\t\n   206\t## Appendix: Five-Year Vision (If Things Go Well)\n   207\t\n   208\tThis is speculative, but it might be helpful to sketch what could emerge over time if the initial work proves valuable:\n   209\t\n   210\t| Year | What Might Emerge | Possible Community Mechanisms |\n   211\t|------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n   212\t| 2025 | Mosul ToT pilot completed (39 trainers)<br>WhatsApp groups active<br>Climate Space integration begins | Monthly Climate Space gatherings<br>30-day post-training reunions |\n   213\t| 2026 | Anbar and Baghdad expansions (if funded)<br>Annual showcase event (if feasible)<br>Simple trainer directory live<br>University partnerships formalized | Bi-annual larger gatherings<br>Digital directory Phase 1<br>Government subsidy advocacy begins |\n   214\t| 2027 | Quality assurance system operating<br>Some employer-sponsored cohorts<br>University-embedded ToT pilots<br>150-200 trainers total (if demand exists) | Peer review systems<br>Natural mentorship networks<br>Regular curriculum updates |\n   215\t| 2028+ | Government subsidy expansion (if advocacy succeeds)<br>Self-sustaining through mixed funding<br>Regional replication (Kurdistan, Basra)<br>National green housing community | Continuous improvement cycles<br>Alumni network operates organically<br>Market-driven training demand |\n   216\t\n   217\tEach phase would only make sense if the previous phase is healthy.

              "json_block": "{\"language\": \"markdown\", \"code\": \"Employer-sponsored training: Solar companies could send staff to ToT and pay a training fee. This is actually already happening informally\\u2014companies sent employees to the October ToT. It might be worth formalizing with a fee structure (maybe 50,000-100,000 IQD per participant).\\n\\nUniversity partnerships: If ToT becomes embedded in university continuing education programs, universities could provide venues (reducing costs) and their certification would add credibility. Dr. Abdulhakim at University of Mosul and Saad Salih at Al-Noor University both expressed interest in this direction.\\n\\nParticipant fees on a sliding scale: Those who can afford to contribute could pay (around 50,000 IQD), while others receive scholarships. Revenue would help offset costs without being required for participation.\\n\\nGrant funding: Development agencies like UNDP and GIZ often support green skills training. A strong track record from the initial cohorts would help with future fundraising applications.\\n\\nGovernment subsidy (longer-term advocacy): The Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials like cement and rebar. There might be potential to expand this to include insulation materials, which would dramatically increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates. This would require a 2-3 year advocacy campaign (discussed more in Section 11.8).\\n\\nRather than trying to engineer a break-even model, it might make more sense to focus on value creation. If the training genuinely helps people start businesses, get jobs, and improve their communities, funding sources will probably emerge. The market will reveal which models actually work.\\n\\n## 11.7 Rooting the Work in Institutions\\n\\nTo avoid everything depending on one or two individuals, it helps to root the work in institutions that will outlast any single person's involvement:\\n\\nMosul Space could provide the convening power\\u2014hosting Climate Space gatherings, managing WhatsApp groups, coordinating logistics for events. They're a stable organization with diverse funding sources.\\n\\nUniversity of Mosul offers academic credibility through partnership with Dr. Abdulhakim Nabel. There might be potential to embed ToT in their continuing education program, which would provide access to facilities and long-term institutional stability.\\n\\nAl-Noor University through Saad Salih Dhiab has already offered to host field visits and is interested in a formal partnership. They could provide training venues and practical learning opportunities.\\n\\nIraqi Engineering Union might recognize ToT as professional development credit. Since engineers need continuing education for licensure, this could increase both participation and credibility.\\n\\nSimple memorandums of understanding (maybe 1-2 pages each) could clarify roles without creating unnecessary bureaucracy.\\n\\n## 11.8 Government Subsidy Advocacy: A Longer-Term Possibility\\n\\nDuring interviews, Wifaq Ahmed from Mosul Heritage Foundation mentioned something interesting: the Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials\\u2014homeowners can get money back when they buy cement and rebar. She suggested exploring whether this subsidy could expand to include insulation materials.\\n\\nThis matters because currently insulation is seen as a luxury rather than essential. If a government subsidy covered 30-50% of insulation costs, the return on investment would improve from 3-4 years to maybe 1.5-2 years. Mass adoption would become economically feasible. And since the policy framework already exists, expansion might be politically realistic\\u2014it's not about creating a new program, just adding items to an existing list.\\n\\nA possible advocacy approach (understanding this would take 2-3 years):\\n\\nDocument the case by compiling ToT graduate case studies showing energy savings, health benefits, and comfort improvements. Calculate the broader impacts: if government subsidized insulation, how many more households could afford it, how many jobs would be created, how much reduction in fuel imports.\\n\\nBuild a coalition including University of Mosul (academic credibility), Iraqi Engineering Union (professional endorsement), private sector suppliers like SIKA and SMTC (who would benefit and might lobby), and ITC (international reputation and economic development expertise).\\n\\nRun a pilot demonstration retrofitting 10-20 homes with insulation using ITC or UNDP funding. Document before/after energy bills, thermal imaging, homeowner testimonials. Invite government officials to site visits, perhaps at the annual showcase event.\\n\\nSubmit a policy brief to the Ministry of Construction and Housing emphasizing that subsidizing insulation creates jobs, reduces energy poverty, and improves climate resilience\\u2014achievable by adding just a few items to an existing subsidy list.\\n\\nITC's role could be leveraging existing government relationships, providing technical analysis, and helping coordinate the coalition. This is definitely long-term work, but potentially transformational if it succeeds.\\n\\n## 11.9 Learning From What Actually Happens\\n\\nA few simple feedback mechanisms could help the training evolve based on real experience:\\n\\nPost-training surveys about a week after ToT asking what worked, what needs improvement, and whether trainers feel ready. This is already being done (the feedback forms are attached), and insights from those surveys are already informing the next cohorts.\\n\\n30-day reunion check-ins to see who's actually implementing what they learned and what challenges they're facing. Real-world implementation tends to reveal curriculum gaps that weren't obvious during training.\\n\\nMonthly Climate Space discussions where organic feedback emerges through regular gatherings. When trainers keep hearing \\\"participants ask about X,\\\" that might signal something to add to the curriculum.\\n\\nEmployer feedback from apprenticeship partners about whether graduates are showing up with needed skills and what might be missing. This closes the loop between training content and actual market needs.\\n\\nAnnual curriculum reviews where trainers gather once a year to update materials\\u2014adding new technologies, removing outdated content, incorporating lessons from the field.\\n\\nAn example of how this could work: if multiple trainers report that participants struggle with U-value calculations, add visual decision trees and worked examples, test in the next cohort, assess whether it helped, keep it if it did or iterate if it didn't.\\n\\n## 11.10 Possible Roles for ITC Going Forward\\n\\nIn the short term (2025-2026), ITC might continue funding initial ToT cohorts in Mosul, Anbar, and Baghdad, support the annual showcase event if it happens, help develop a simple digital trainer directory, and facilitate university partnerships.\\n\\nMedium-term (2026-2027) could involve transitioning coordination responsibilities to Mosul Space, supporting the government subsidy advocacy campaign if that moves forward, helping develop quality assurance systems, and documenting case studies for potential replication in other regions.\\n\\nLonger-term (2027+), the relationship could shift to periodic check-ins rather than daily management. ITC would be available for troubleshooting but not necessarily driving things. There might be opportunities to share the model with other Iraqi cities or conflict-affected regions, while letting the Mosul community increasingly own and evolve the work.\\n\\nAs for my continuing involvement, I'd be interested in: conducting more expert interviews when needed for expansions, co-facilitating ToT sessions (which have been really enjoyable), building and maintaining digital infrastructure, and developing quality assurance and review systems. But this would depend on funding and what actually makes sense as things develop.\\n\\n## 11.11 Scaling: Only If and When It Makes Sense\\n\\nPhase 1 (2025): Mosul Pilot has been completed with 39 trainers across Solar, Insulation, and Architecture modules in three ToT sessions delivered in September and October 2025.\\n\\nPhase 2 (2026): If the Mosul model proves valuable, expansion to Anbar and Baghdad could make sense. Trainers from Mosul might co-facilitate ToT in other governorates. Local partners (universities, NGOs) would need to be identified to host. The curriculum would probably need adaptation for regional differences in climate, energy tariffs, and market conditions. A possible target would be 60 additional trainers (around 20 per governorate).\\n\\nPhase 3 (2027-2028): If demand emerges organically and the community stays healthy, there could be national reach. This might involve formalizing certification (something like \\\"ITC Certified Green Housing Trainer\\\"), partnering with the Iraqi Engineering Union for professional recognition, and having original trainers become regional ToT facilitators if they're interested. A very rough target might be 200+ trainers nationwide.\\n\\nThe key principle is that scaling should only happen if the community is healthy and trainers are genuinely succeeding. Growth for its own sake tends to kill what makes something work. Quality and authenticity need to come first, with scale following only if it makes sense.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThese recommendations try to honor what emerged from listening to trainers, reviewing feedback, and thinking about how communities actually sustain themselves. The suggestions lean toward creating minimal structure\\u2014just enough for people to find each other and connect\\u2014while trusting that if the training genuinely serves people, they'll figure out how to keep it going.\\n\\nA few core ideas run through these recommendations:\\n\\nConnect with what already exists rather than building parallel structures. Mosul Space's Climate Space gatherings are already working, so it makes sense to build on that rather than starting from scratch.\\n\\nRecognize natural leadership rather than creating formal hierarchies. Some trainers will naturally become go-to resources through the quality of their work and their generosity with time and knowledge.\\n\\nCreate rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep the format flexible so it can adapt to what people actually need.\\n\\nBuild simple digital infrastructure that could evolve over time based on what proves useful.\\n\\nExplore multiple funding possibilities without trying to engineer a perfect break-even model. If the training creates genuine value, funding sources will probably emerge.\\n\\nRoot the work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend entirely on specific individuals.\\n\\nConsider longer-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion, understanding this would take years but could be transformational.\\n\\nKeep learning from what actually happens through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews.\\n\\nScale only if the community is healthy and trainers are succeeding. Quality and authenticity matter more than growth.\\n\\nThe ToT sessions completed in September and October 2025 are really just a beginning. What happens next depends on whether they genuinely help people start businesses, get jobs, and serve their communities. These recommendations are offered as possibilities for ITC and Mosul Space to consider, not as prescriptions to follow. The community will ultimately figure out what works for them.\\n\\n## Appendix: Five-Year Vision (If Things Go Well)\\n\\nThis is speculative, but it might be helpful to sketch what could emerge over time if the initial work proves valuable:\\n\\n| Year | What Might Emerge | Possible Community Mechanisms |\\n|------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\\n| 2025 | Mosul ToT pilot completed (39 trainers)<br>WhatsApp groups active<br>Climate Space integration begins | Monthly Climate Space gatherings<br>30-day post-training reunions |\\n| 2026 | Anbar and Baghdad expansions (if funded)<br>Annual showcase event (if feasible)<br>Simple trainer directory live<br>University partnerships formalized | Bi-annual larger gatherings<br>Digital directory Phase 1<br>Government subsidy advocacy begins |\\n| 2027 | Quality assurance system operating<br>Some employer-sponsored cohorts<br>University-embedded ToT pilots<br>150-200 trainers total (if demand exists) | Peer review systems<br>Natural mentorship networks<br>Regular curriculum updates |\\n| 2028+ | Government subsidy expansion (if advocacy succeeds)<br>Self-sustaining through mixed funding<br>Regional replication (Kurdistan, Basra)<br>National green housing community | Continuous improvement cycles<br>Alumni network operates organically<br>Market-driven training demand |\\n\\nEach phase would only make sense if the previous phase is healthy.

Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the policies and guidelines and the Manual of Style, but does not belong on this page.\n    41\t\n    42\tThis list is not a ban on certain words, phrases, or punctuation. Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated, as the large language models that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of very common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, specific to Wikipedia. While some of its advice may be broadly applicable, some signs—particularly those involving punctuation and formatting—may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.\n    43\t\n    44\tThe patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor wordsmithing, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry much more serious policy risks. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently), those surface defects might not be present, but deeper problems can be. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content and Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide.\n    45\t\n    46\tThe speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which can be found in § Communication intended for the user and the other two in § Citations. The other signs are not sufficient on their own for speedy deletion.\n    47\t\n    48\tDo not solely rely on artificial intelligence content detection tools (such as GPTZero) to evaluate whether text is LLM-generated. While they perform better than random chance, these tools have nontrivial error rates and cannot replace human judgment.[1]\n    49\t\n    50\tContent\n    51\tShortcuts\n    52\tWP:AIWTW\n    53\tWP:AI-ISM\n    54\tLLMs (and artificial neural networks in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to regress to the mean; that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a \"tell\" for detecting AI-generated content.\n    55\t\n    56\tFor example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. Consequently, the LLM tends to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the specific detail \"invented the first train-coupling device\" might become \"a revolutionary titan of industry.\" It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.[2]\n    57\t\n    58\tThis statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements, that could equally apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.\n    59\t\n    60\tUndue emphasis on symbolism and importance\n    61\tWords to watch: stands/serves as / is a testament/reminder, plays a vital/significant/crucial role, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing, enduring/lasting impact, key turning point, indelible mark, deeply rooted, profound heritage, steadfast dedication ...\n    62\tLLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects of the topic represent or contribute to a broader topic.[3] There is a distinct and easily identifiable repertoire of ways that it writes these statements.[4] LLMs may include them for even the most mundane of things, sometimes with hedging preambles like \"While [minor/not well known/etc], it [symbolizes/stands as/contributes]...\"\n    63\t\n    64\tWhen talking about biology (e.g., when asked to discuss a given animal or plant species), LLMs tend to put too much emphasis on the species' conservation status and the efforts to protect it, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist, and may strain to derive symbolism from things like taxonomy.\n    65\t\n    66\tExamples\n    67\t\n\t< truncated lines 68-771 >\n   772\tSpecial:PermanentLink/1292432848#References\n   773\tSpecial:PermanentLink/1291491974#References\n   774\tSpecial:PermanentLink/1291561040#References\n   775\tLinks to searches\n   776\tCategory:Pages with incorrect ref formatting\n   777\tMiscellaneous\n   778\tAbrupt cut offs\n   779\tAI tools may abruptly stop generating content, for example if they predict the end of text sequence (appearing as <|endoftext|>) next. Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited, and further responses require the user to select \"continue generating\".\n   780\t\n   781\tThis method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a copyright violation rather than the use of an LLM.\n   782\t\n   783\tDiscrepancies in writing style and variety of English\n   784\tA sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools.\n   785\t\n   786\tAnother discrepancy is a mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[6] Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.\n   787\t\n   788\tAge of text relative to ChatGPT launch\n   789\tChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not easily accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.\n   790\t\n   791\tIt is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia prior to November 30, 2022 was generated by an LLM. If an edit was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some older text may display some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.\n   792\t\n   793\tOverwhelmingly verbose edit summaries\n   794\tAI-generated edit summaries are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without abbreviations, and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.\n   795\t\n   796\tMost editors using AI do not ask for summaries to be generated.\n   797\t\n   798\tRefined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with Wikipedia's content guidelines. Removed promotional wording, ensured factual accuracy, and maintained a clear, well-structured presentation. Updated sections on history, coverage, challenges, and recognition for clarity and relevance. Added proper formatting and categorized the entry accordingly\n   799\t\n   800\t— Edit summary from this revision to Khaama Press\n   801\tI formalized the tone, clarified technical content, ensured neutrality, and indicated citation needs. Historical narratives were streamlined, allocation details specified with regulatory references, propagation explanations made reader-friendly, and equipment discussions focused on availability and regulatory compliance, all while adhering to encyclopedic standards.\n   802\t\n   803\t— Edit summary from this revision to 4-metre band\n   804\t**Concise edit summary:** Improved clarity, flow, and readability of the plot section; reduced redundancy and refined tone for better encyclopedic style.\n   805\t\n   806\t— Edit summary from this revision to Anaganaga (film)\n   807\t\"Submission statements\" in AFC drafts\n   808\tThis one is specific to drafts submitted by Articles for Creation. At least one LLM tends to insert \"submission statements\" supposedly intended for reviewers that supposedly explain why the subject is notable and why the draft meets Wikipedia guidelines. Of course, all this actually does is let reviewers know that the draft is LLM-generated, and should be declined or speedied without a second thought.\n   809\t\n   810\tReviewer note (for AfC): This draft is a neutral and well-sourced biography of Portuguese public manager Jorge Patrão. All references are from independent, reliable sources (Público, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Negócios, RTP, O Interior, Agência Lusa) covering his public career and cultural activity. It meets WP:RS and WP:BLP standards and demonstrates clear notability per WP:NBIO through: – Presidency of Serra da Estrela Tourism Region (1998–2013); – Presidency of Parkurbis – Covilhã Science and Technology Park; – Founding role in Rede de Judiarias de Portugal (member of the Council of Europe’s European Routes of Jewish Heritage); – Authorship of the book \"1677 – A Fábrica d’El-Rei\"; – Founder/curator of the Beatriz de Luna Art Collection (Old Master focus). There is also a Portuguese version of this article at pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Patrão. Thank you for your review. -->\n   811\t\n   812\t— Found at the top of Draft:Jorge Patrão (all the inevitable formatting errors are present in the original)\n   813\tPre-declined AFC review templates\n   814\tOccasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an AFC review template already set to \"declined\". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like {{AfC submission|d}}, in which the \"d\" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting {{AfC submission/declined}}. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk or one of the other help pages why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free \"submission declined\" header is a strong indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.\n   815\t\n   816\tLinks to searches\n   817\t\n   818\tyou declined your own draft\n   819\tAbnormalities in categories and the \"see also\" section\n   820\tLLM-generated Wikipedia pages often include multiple categories and a see also section, but the pages linked in both cases often don't actually exist. These red links are frequently for generic concepts that seem like plausible Wikipedia article/category titles. Red links in both of these parts of the page are discouraged by Wikipedia's guidelines.\n   821\t\n   822\tPay attention to the blue links in see-also sections as well. LLM-generated \"see also\" sections often tend to fill them up (to at least 3 links) seemingly out of obligation, so if a new page/draft on some startup links to a broad term like Financial technology in its see-also section, that's a bit suspicious.\n   823\t\n   824\tYou may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite Category:Entrepreneurs. Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.\n   825\t\n   826\tOf course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule; new users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections.\n   827\t\n   828\tIneffective indicators\n   829\tFalse accusations of AI use can drive away new editors and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider if Dunning–Kruger effect and confirmation bias is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection—and may even indicate the opposite.\n   830\t\n   831\tPerfect grammar: While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also § Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English.)\n   832\t\"Bland\" or \"robotic\" prose: By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as \"robotic\" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.[9]\n   833\t\"Fancy,\" \"academic,\" or unusual words: While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are long and have difficult readability scores, the correlation does not extend to all \"fancy,\" academic, or \"advanced\"-sounding prose.[1] \"AI vocabulary\" and academic vocabulary are not the same thing; indeed, the specific words overused by AI appeared far less frequently in research abstracts prior to 2023.[4] Low-frequency and \"unusual\" words are also less likely to show up in AI-generated writing as they are statistically less common, unless they are proper nouns directly related to the topic.\n   834\tShortcut\n   835\tWP:AILETTER\n   836\tLetter-like writing (in isolation): Although many talk page messages written with salutations, valedictions and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, that is not guaranteed to be the case for all such messages. Letters and emails have conventionally been written in similar ways long before modern LLMs existed. An AI-generated message may start with a subject line, include a vertical list[f] or one or more placeholders, or end abruptly. In addition, some human editors may mistakenly post emails, letters, petitions, or messages intended for the article's subject, frequently formatted as letters.[g] While such edits are generally off-topic and may be removed per the guidelines at WP:NOTFORUM—particularly if they contain personal information—they are not necessarily LLM-generated.\n   837\tConjunctions (in isolation): While LLMs tend to overuse connecting words and phrases in a stilted, formulaic way that implies inappropriate synthesis of facts, such uses are typical of essay-like writing by humans and are not strong indicators by themselves.\n   838\tBizarre wikitext: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in § Use of Markdown, they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, \"inexplicable\" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in § Markup). Bizarrely placed HTML tags like <span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool (T113137). Misplaced syntax like ''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel. (rendered as \"Catch-22 is a satirical novel.\") are more indicative of mistakes in VisualEditor, where such errors are harder to notice than in source editing.",

The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range (e.g. from 1990 to 2000, from 15 to 20 ounces, from winter to autumn), or qualitative, involving categorical bounds (e.g. \\\"from seed to tree\\\", \\\"from mild to severe\\\", \\\"from white belt to black belt\\\"). The same constructions may be used to form a merism\\u2014a figure of speech that combines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative meaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable scale: from head to toe (the length of a body denoting the whole body), from soup to nuts (clearly based on time), etc. This is not a false range.\\n\\nLLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply mentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be identified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another scale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a false range. LLMs often employ \\\"figurative\\\" (often simply: meaningless) \\\"from ... to ...\\\" constructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or even unrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred. LLMs do this because such meaningless language is used in persuasive writing to impress and woo, and LLMs are heavily influenced by examples of persuasive writing during their training.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nOur journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars that forge the elements of life, to the enigmatic dance of dark matter and dark energy that shape its destiny.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nIntelligence and Creativity: From problem-solving and tool-making to scientific discovery, artistic expression, and technological innovation, human intelligence is characterized by its adaptability and capacity for novel solutions.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nContinued Scientific Discovery: The quest to understand the universe, life, and ourselves will continue to drive scientific breakthroughs, from fundamental physics to medicine and neuroscience.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom Draft:The Cosmos Unveiled: A Grand Tapestry of Existence\\nStyle\\nTitle case\\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters \\u00a7 Headings, headers, and captions.\\nShortcut\\nWP:AITITLECASE\\nIn section headings, AI chatbots strongly tend to capitalize all main words.[1]\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nEarly Life and Education\\nThomas was born in Cochranville, Pennsylvania.

As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running on MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like Miraheze, LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data. While the corpora of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: Markdown. Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using it, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia articles look like formatted documents.\\n\\nWhen asked about its \\\"formatting guidelines\\\", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level instructions typically generates some variation of the following (this is Microsoft Copilot in mid-2025):\\n\\n## Formatting Guidelines\\n\\n- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.  \\n- Use a single main title (`#`) and clear primary subheadings (`##`).  \\n- Keep paragraphs short (3\\u20135 sentences, \\u2264150 words).  \\n- Break large topics into labeled subsections.  \\n- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.  \\n- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.  \\n- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.  \\n- Use horizontal dividers (`---`) between major sections.  \\n- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.  \\n- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.  \\n- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.  \\n- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.\\nAs the above suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.\\n\\nEven when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using syntactically correct wikitext, as their training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in Markdown. When told to \\\"generate an article\\\", a chatbot typically defaults to using Markdown for the generated output, which is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might \\\"realize\\\" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (`wikitext`)?[d] in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax is often rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style fenced code block (its syntax for WP:PRE) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: ```wikitext.[e]\\n\\nThe presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like Obsidian and GitHub, and on platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Slack. Some writing tools and apps, such as iOS Notes, Google Docs, and Windows Notepad, support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nSee also: Markdown \\u00a7 Examples\\nI believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** \\u2014 not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being \\u201cunhelpful\\u201d, and a general impression that I am \\\"not here to build an encyclopedia\\\". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments \\\"AI-generated\\\" \\u2014 without explaining how they are substantively flawed.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFrom this revision to a user talk page\\n- The Wikipedia entry does not explicitly mention the \\\"Cyberhero League\\\" being recognized as a winner of the World Future Society's BetaLaunch Technology competition, as detailed in the interview with THE FUTURIST ([1](https://consciouscreativity.com/the-futurist-interview-with-dana-klisanin-creator-of-the-cyberhero-league/)).

They may also treat ordinary references to topics as categories, thus generating non-existent categories.

Most links become broken over time, but these factors make it unlikely that the link was ever real.\\n\\nInvalid DOI and ISBNs\\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see Wikipedia:DOI and Wikipedia:ISBN.\\nA checksum can be used to verify ISBNs. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates display a warning if so. Similarly, DOIs are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of hallucinated references.\\n\\nRelated are DOIs that point to entirely unrelated articles and general book citations without pages. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.\\n\\nOhm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1]. Ohm\\u2019s Law applies to many materials and components that are \\\"ohmic,\\\" meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors [2][3].\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n1. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.).

A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[6] Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.\\n\\nAge of text relative to ChatGPT launch\\nChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022.

Thank you for your review. -->\\n\\n\\u2014\\u200aFound at the top of Draft:Jorge Patr\\u00e3o (all the inevitable formatting errors are present in the original)\\nPre-declined AFC review templates\\nOccasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an AFC review template already set to \\\"declined\\\". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like {{AfC submission|d}}, in which the \\\"d\\\" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting {{AfC submission/declined}}. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk or one of the other help pages why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free \\\"submission declined\\\" header is a strong indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.\\n\\nLinks to searches\\n\\nyou declined your own draft\\nAbnormalities in categories and the \\\"see also\\\" section\\nLLM-generated Wikipedia pages often include multiple categories and a see also section, but the pages linked in both cases often don't actually exist. These red links are frequently for generic concepts that seem like plausible Wikipedia article/category titles. Red links in both of these parts of the page are discouraged by Wikipedia's guidelines.\\n\\nPay attention to the blue links in see-also sections as well. LLM-generated \\\"see also\\\" sections often tend to fill them up (to at least 3 links) seemingly out of obligation, so if a new page/draft on some startup links to a broad term like Financial technology in its see-also section, that's a bit suspicious.\\n\\nYou may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite Category:Entrepreneurs. Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.\\n\\nOf course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule; new users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections.\\n\\nIneffective indicators\\nFalse accusations of AI use can drive away new editors and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider if Dunning\\u2013Kruger effect and confirmation bias is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection\\u2014and may even indicate the opposite.\\n\\nPerfect grammar: While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also \\u00a7 Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English.)\\n\\\"Bland\\\" or \\\"robotic\\\" prose: By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as \\\"robotic\\\" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.[9]\\n\\\"Fancy,\\\" \\\"academic,\\\" or unusual words: While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are long and have difficult readability scores, the correlation does not extend to all \\\"fancy,\\\" academic, or \\\"advanced\\\"-sounding prose.[1] \\\"AI vocabulary\\\" and academic vocabulary are not the same thing; indeed, the specific words overused by AI appeared far less frequently in research abstracts prior to 2023.[4] Low-frequency and \\\"unusual\\\" words are also less likely to show up in AI-generated writing as they are statistically less common, unless they are proper nouns directly related to the topic.\\nShortcut\\nWP:AILETTER\\nLetter-like writing (in isolation): Although many talk page messages written with salutations, valedictions and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, that is not guaranteed to be the case for all such messages. Letters and emails have conventionally been written in similar ways long before modern LLMs existed. An AI-generated message may start with a subject line, include a vertical list[f] or one or more placeholders, or end abruptly. In addition, some human editors may mistakenly post emails, letters, petitions, or messages intended for the article's subject, frequently formatted as letters.[g] While such edits are generally off-topic and may be removed per the guidelines at WP:NOTFORUM\\u2014particularly if they contain personal information\\u2014they are not necessarily LLM-generated.\\nConjunctions (in isolation): While LLMs tend to overuse connecting words and phrases in a stilted, formulaic way that implies inappropriate synthesis of facts, such uses are typical of essay-like writing by humans and are not strong indicators by themselves.\\nBizarre wikitext: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in \\u00a7 Use of Markdown, they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, \\\"inexplicable\\\" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in \\u00a7 Markup). Bizarrely placed HTML tags like <span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool (T113137). Misplaced syntax like ''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel. (rendered as \\\"Catch-22 is a satirical novel.\\\") are more indicative of mistakes in VisualEditor, where such errors are harder to notice than in source editing.\", \"filename\": \"/mnt/user-data/uploads/AIWritingGiveawaysToAvoid.txt\"}"

The question now is how this continues. Based on trainer feedback, expert interviews, and observing what Mosul Space already does through Climate Space, three approaches seem possible:\n\n| Approach | What It Looks Like | Strengths | Challenges |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|------------|\n| **Organic Community** | Monthly gatherings at existing Climate Space, natural mentorship, minimal formal structure | Authentic, low overhead, builds on what works | May lack visibility for scaling, harder to measure |\n| **Institutional Embedding** | ToT becomes part of university continuing education programs | Stable, credible, sustainable funding | Slower to implement, less flexible |\n| **Hybrid Model** | Community gatherings + institutional anchors + selective structure where needed | Balances authenticity with stability | Requires coordination across multiple partners |\n\nThis plan suggests a hybrid approach: connect to Climate Space for community building, partner with universities for stability, and add minimal infrastructure (digital directory, quality checks) only where gaps exist.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThese recommendations come from listening to trainers during ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, and interviewing solar and insulation experts. The challenge is creating enough structure that people can connect without imposing so much that it feels bureaucratic.\n\nTrainers emphasized their work is motivated by service—rebuilding Mosul, reducing energy poverty, protecting the environment. Any continuation needs to honor that rather than replacing it with frameworks.\n\nThe ToT sessions are a beginning. What happens next depends on whether training helps people start businesses, get jobs, and serve their communities. These are possibilities to consider, not prescriptions to follow.",

The ideas here come from listening to trainers during the ToT sessions, reviewing feedback forms, interviewing solar and insulation experts, and thinking about what Mosul Space is already doing through their Climate Space initiative.\n\nThe recommendations try to balance two things: creating enough structure that people can find each other and connect, while avoiding so much structure that it becomes burdensome or feels imposed from outside. Throughout the interviews, trainers emphasized that this work is motivated by service—helping Mosul rebuild, reducing energy poverty, protecting the environment. Any sustainability approach needs to honor that intrinsic motivation rather than replace it with elaborate frameworks.\n\nThe ToT sessions are really just a beginning. What happens next depends on whether the training genuinely helps people start businesses, get jobs, and serve their communities. If it does, they'll find ways to keep it going. These recommendations are offered as possibilities to consider, not as prescriptions to follow.",

It might be worth formalizing with a fee structure (maybe 50,000-100,000 IQD per participant).\n\nUniversity partnerships: If ToT becomes embedded in university continuing education programs, universities could provide venues (reducing costs) and their certification would add credibility.

Revenue would help offset costs without being required for participation.\n\nGrant funding: Development agencies like UNDP and GIZ often support green skills training. A strong track record from the initial cohorts would help with future fundraising applications.\n\nGovernment subsidy (longer-term advocacy): The Iraqi government already subsidizes construction materials like cement and rebar. There might be potential to expand this to include insulation materials, which would dramatically increase market demand and create more jobs for graduates. This would require a 2-3 year advocacy campaign (discussed more in Section 11.8).\n\nRather than trying to engineer a break-even model, it might make more sense to focus on value creation.

Recognize natural leadership through quality work and generosity rather than creating formal hierarchies. Create rhythm through events (monthly gatherings, annual showcase, 30-day reunions) but keep format flexible. Build simple digital infrastructure that evolves based on what proves useful. Explore multiple funding possibilities without engineering a perfect model—if training creates value, funding will emerge. Root work in institutions (universities, Mosul Space, engineering union) so it doesn't depend on specific individuals. Consider long-term advocacy for government subsidy expansion (2-3 years, potentially transformational). Keep learning from practice through feedback loops and annual curriculum reviews.

Mosul Space's Climate Space gatherings are already working, so it makes sense to build on that rather than starting from scratch.\n\nRecognize natural leadership rather than creating formal hierarchies.

The strategic table at the beginning immediately orients the reader, and the language throughout is clearer, more direct, and authentically humble.",
