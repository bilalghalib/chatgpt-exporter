If we want them to know about the product/value offered, we use different channels to reach them. Once we have reached the customer segments, we want to build relationships with them to get them coming back. Delivering value to your customers allows you to make sales and bring in revenue (maybe they even bring friends along). \r\nWhere have you seen this before? \r\nThis is what they did during Ignite!\r\nYou should have a clear picture of your customers, what they care about, how to reach them, and have an idea of how you will actually make money through this interaction. \r\n\r\nMove on to the left side:\r\nNext let’s look at all the key activities you need to do in order to make this a reality. You need to put in work and resources to build and deliver the value you promised to your customers. There are a lot of activities and resources that go into the consistent delivery of value to your customers (running your business). You usually can’t do it all yourself. In this case, you need to find the right partners to help you achieve your tasks. These partners can help by providing resources (human, financial, etc…) or by taking responsibility for some key activities. All of this costs money to do. \r\n\r\nConclusion: In the next slides, we are going to go point by point on the BMC to understand it more. We will discuss the different parts as a group and go over an example. After that, there will be time to apply it to your business. Keep in mind that this session will stay fairly high level for now. It is about getting a snapshot, not going into detail! We will go into detail during future sessions.\r\n\r\nTransition to the next slide: We will start with the value proposition.\"\"\"\n\t-\t9\tAdded New Content\t-\t\"Added a fourth circle to slide indicating shared values between the business and the customer - indicating alignment.\"\n\t17\t21\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\t\"\"\"<5 minutes: Discussion\r\n\r\nWhat are key resources? How do we get them? \r\nPotential answers:\r\nKey resources are the personnel, tools, and budget the team will need access to \r\nEvery business model requires Key Resources. Your resources allow your enterprise to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and earn revenues. \r\nDifferent Key Resources are needed depending on the type of business model (some business need a lot of cash on hand while others need a lot of human resources)\r\nKey resources can be owned or leased by the company or acquired from key partners (including investors).\r\nExamples:\r\nPhysical resources (tangible assets)\r\nFinancial resources (cash), \r\nIntellectual resources\r\nHuman resources. \r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble identifying the right key activities, ask yourself the following:\r\nWhat Key Resources do our Value Propositions require?\r\nOur Distribution Channels?\r\nCustomer Relationships?\r\nRevenue Streams?\r\n\r\n--------\r\nMore details on different common key resources. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\r\n--------\r\nTypes of Key Resources: Key Resources can be categorized as follows:\r\nPhysical: This category includes physical assets such as manufacturing facilities, buildings, vehicles, machines, systems, point-of-sales systems, and distribution networks. Retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon.com rely heavily on physical resources, which are often capital-intensive. The former has an enormous global network of stores and related logistics infrastructure. The latter has an extensive IT, warehouse, and logistics infrastructure.\r\nIntellectual Property: Intellectual property resources such as brands, proprietary knowledge, patents and copyrights, partnerships, and customer databases are increasingly important components of a strong business model. Intellectual property resources are difficult to develop but when successfully created may offer substantial value. Consumer goods companies such as Nike and Sony rely heavily on their brand as a Key Resource. Microsoft and SAP depend on software and related intellectual property developed over many years. Qualcomm, a designer and supplier of chipsets for broadband mobile devices, built its business model around patented microchip designs that earn the company substantial licensing fees.\r\nHuman: Every enterprise requires human resources, but people are particularly prominent in certain business models. For example, human resources are crucial in knowledge-intensive and creative industries. A pharmaceutical company such as Novartis, for example, relies heavily on human resources: its business model is predicated on an army of experienced scientists and a large and skilled sales force.\r\nFinancial: Some business models call for financial resources and/or financial guarantees, such as cash, lines of credit, or a stock option pool for hiring key employees. Ericsson, the telecom manufacturer, provides an example of financial resource leverage within a business model. Ericsson may opt to borrow funds from banks and capital markets, then use a portion of the proceeds to provide vendor financing to equipment customers, thus ensuring that orders are placed with Ericsson rather than competitors.\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Discussion (5 minutes)\r\nPrompt:\r\nWhat are key resources? How do we get them?\r\nPotential answers:\r\nKey resources are the personnel, tools, and budget the team will need access to.\r\nEvery business model requires Key Resources—these enable an enterprise to:\r\nCreate and offer a Value Proposition\r\nReach markets and maintain Customer Relationships\r\nGenerate Revenue Streams\r\nDifferent businesses rely on different types of key resources.\r\nSome require high cash flow (e.g., retail, manufacturing).\r\nOthers rely on skilled human resources (e.g., consulting, software development).\r\nKey resources can be owned, leased, or acquired from key partners (e.g., investors, suppliers, collaborators).\r\n\r\nRefining the Discussion with Values & Resilience Considerations\r\nExpand the conversation beyond traditional resources by integrating values-aligned resources:\r\nHow do your key resources align with your values?\r\nExample: Tech company deciding between high-speed but energy-intensive servers vs. solar-powered servers.\r\nWhich resources are most vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, price volatility, or regulation changes?\r\nExample: Businesses that relied on non-renewable materials saw supply chain delays during COVID.\r\nMitigation: Consider sustainable alternatives that increase stability and reduce long-term costs.\r\nHow could prioritizing sustainability or ethical sourcing make your business more resilient?\r\nExample: Fair-trade coffee brands secure long-term supplier loyalty, ensuring stable pricing.\r\n\r\nKey Resource Categories & Considerations\r\n1. Physical Resources:\r\nFacilities, buildings, vehicles, hardware, logistics networks\r\nValues Lens: Are these resources energy-efficient, responsibly sourced, or adaptable?\r\nExample: A logistics company using fuel-efficient vehicles to reduce costs and emissions.\r\n2. Intellectual Property (IP):\r\nBrand identity, patents, proprietary technology, databases, algorithms\r\nValues Lens: Are these resources accessible, open-source, or ethically developed?\r\nExample: Open-source software companies that enable collaboration while maintaining a revenue model.\r\n3. Human Resources:\r\nEmployees, contractors, advisors\r\nValues Lens: Are hiring, retention, and training practices equitable, ethical, and inclusive?\r\nExample: Businesses that provide fair wages and growth opportunities retain employees longer.\r\n4. Financial Resources:\r\nCapital, investments, revenue streams\r\nValues Lens: Is funding aligned with the company’s mission? Are there ethical finance models?\r\nExample: A sustainable brand choosing impact investors over venture capital for long-term alignment.\r\n\r\nActivity – Resource Resilience Mapping (10 minutes)\r\nGoal: Help participants assess their resources beyond traditional needs—considering values, resilience, and efficiency.\r\nList Your Resources: Identify the key resources required for business success.\r\nAssess Their Alignment: Are these resources chosen for cost, speed, sustainability, ethics, or resilience?\r\nRisk Assessment:\r\nWhich resources are most vulnerable to price fluctuations, shortages, or regulatory changes?\r\nCan alternatives improve stability? (e.g., renewable energy, local sourcing)\r\nValues Integration:\r\nHow could sustainability, ethics, or durability enhance long-term success?\r\nExample: If using imported raw materials, could switching to local suppliers reduce risk and support community businesses?\r\nReflection: Discuss findings with a partner or small group—what surprised them? Any action items identified?\"\"\r\n\"\n\t21\t25\tAdded New Content\t-\t\"Discuss: “How can values-driven investments—like technology or sustainability upgrades—reduce risks and increase profits?”\"\n\t28\t32\tAdded New Content\t\"\"\"Hotels will sign up on my application\r\n\r\nRestaurants, hotels, artisans, and other partners will share in their profits\r\n\r\nTravelers will use my app to book online\r\n\r\nKurdish people are willing to rent their rooms to a foreigner\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Hotels will sign up on my application\n\nRestaurants, hotels, artisans, and other partners will share in their profits\n\nTravelers will use my app to book online\n\nKurdish people are willing to rent their rooms to a foreigner\n\nFuel and food supply chains will not be disrupted due to war or climate change\"\"\"\n\t28\t32\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\t\"\"\"Hotels will sign up on my application\r\nRestaurants, hotels, artisans, and other partners will share in their profits\r\nTravelers will use my app to book online\r\nKurdish people are willing to rent their rooms to a foreigner\r\nEtc… \"\"\"\t\"\"\"Hotels will sign up on my application\r\nRestaurants, hotels, artisans, and other partners will share in their profits\r\nTravelers will use my app to book online\nResilience Assumptions: what if my supply costs increase by 50%\r\nKurdish people are willing to rent their rooms to a foreigner\r\nEtc… \"\"\"\n4.

You probably have to pay for these things every month or on a frequent basis.\r\nAsk: Can someone give me a few examples of operational costs? \r\nWhat about resource efficiency expenses that fall under OPEX?\r\nPotential answers:\r\nMarketing and advertisements,\r\nTravel,\r\nRent,\r\nMeetings,\r\nSupplies, \r\nSalaries, \r\nEnergy audits\r\nEco-certifications\r\nStaff training on sustainability practices.\r\netc. \r\nCapital Expenditure: Capital expenditure, or CapEx, are funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets. These are one time purchases that relate to the long term business success (items that will last at least 1 year or longer). These items aren’t purchased frequently because they last a long time.\r\nAsk: Can someone give me a few examples of capital expenditures? \r\nCan anyone think of an example where an investment in efficiency measures might be categorized as CAPEX?\r\nPotential answers:\r\nComputers\r\nMachines\r\nLand/property\r\nFurniture\r\nIP/legal registration/patents\r\nEven the money you spend renovating your space count as CAP-EX\r\nOther investments that will last over 1 year\r\nEtc…\r\nSolar panels\r\nEnergy-efficient HVAC systems\r\nWater-saving fixtures.\"\"\"\n\t-\t8\tAdded New Content\t-\t\"\"\"Strategic Efficiency Investments\r\n\nAdd a table: \nInvestment\r\nInitial Cost\r\nAnnual Savings\r\nPayback Period\r\nSolar Panels\r\n$3,000\r\n$960\r\n3.1 years\r\nLED Lighting\r\n$500\r\n$240\r\n2.1 years\r\nWater Systems\r\n$800\r\n$300\r\n2.7 years\r\n\nFinancial Benefits:\r\nAppears on Balance Sheet as: Fixed Asset\r\nReduces monthly operating costs by: $125\r\nImproves brand perception with customers\r\n\nBusiness Resilience Benefits:\r\nProtects against rising utility costs\r\nReduces dependency on external resources\r\nCreates more stable monthly expenses\r\n\n\nFacilitator notes:\n\r\nPURPOSE: This slide introduces efficiency investments as a strategic category of capital expenditures that generate ongoing financial benefits.\r\n\r\nPRESENTATION (5 minutes):\r\n1. Link to previous slide: \"\"We just discussed the difference between operating expenses and capital expenditures. Now let's look at a specific type of capital expenditure that can actually reduce your operating expenses over time.\"\"\r\n\r\n2. Walk through each example:\r\n   - \"\"A solar panel installation costs $3,000 upfront, but saves $80/month in electricity. Over its 25-year lifespan, it will generate $24,000 in savings.\"\"\r\n   - \"\"LED lighting has a faster payback period of just over 2 years, then continues saving money for 3+ more years.\"\"\r\n   - \"\"Water-saving systems can both reduce utility bills and protect against water shortages.\"\"\r\n\r\n3. Emphasize the dual benefits:\r\n   - \"\"These investments appear on your balance sheet exactly like any other fixed asset.\"\"\r\n   - \"\"But unlike many other assets, they actively reduce your monthly expenses.\"\"\r\n   - \"\"This means they directly improve your profitability after the payback period.\"\"\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION PROMPT (3 minutes):\r\n- \"\"What utility expenses in your business consistently increase year after year?\"\"\r\n- \"\"Are there any efficiency investments that would make sense for your specific business model?\"\"\r\n\r\nTRANSITION TO NEXT SLIDE:\r\n\"\"Now let's continue with categorizing your startup costs as either expenses or assets that you'll capitalize.\"\"\"\"\"\n\t10\t11\tAdded New Content\t\"\"\"Table of  TYPE\nAMOUNT\nNOTES\nESTIMATED USEFUL LIFETIME VALUE (IN YEARS)\nINFORMATION USED FOR DEPRECIATION\n....\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Add new row:\n Capitalize\r\n$3000\r\nSolar Panel Installation\r\n25\r\n$120\r\n$10\"\"\"\n\t18\t20\tAdded New Content\t-\t\"\"\"Facilitator Note:\r\n\"\"Let’s say you decide to invest in solar panels to reduce long-term electricity costs. This would show up as:\r\nInvestment: $3,000 (Solar Panels) added under Assets → Technology\r\nDepreciation Impact: $120/year or $10/month added to P&L → Depreciation\r\nCash Reduction: $3,000 deducted from Cash Reserves unless financed by a grant.\r\nAsk:\r\nHow does this change your financial health?\r\nWould this make your business stronger in the long run?\r\nPossible Answer:\r\nEven though cash is reduced in the short term, this investment will lower electricity costs each month, improving the company’s long-term profitability.\"\"\"\n11.

They can have many layers. \nCore benefit: The fundamental need the customer is filling by buying the product.\nActual product: The actual product is the thing itself.\nAdditional services: Additional services are all of those extra “invisible” things that customers get and experience when they buy a product.\nEnduring Value: When thinking about product layers, consider how the service can extend beyond immediate use and contribute to long-term sustainability. \n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nGroup example: Explore the layers of a product with an example business.\nAsk: What are the product layers of Al-Eiz Takeaway Kitchen in Qaim, Iraq?\nCore benefit: \nProviding accessible and affordable traditional meals to a diverse customer base (farmers, soldiers, NGO workers, etc.)\nActual product: \nA physical kitchen facility in Qaim\nPreparation of 200+ daily meals\nTraditional dishes like timmen qouzi and dolma\nLocal ingredients to maintain authentic flavors\nEtc…\nAdditional services:\nEfficient meal preparation process to serve a high-demand customer base.\nHiring and training widows to support the local community (enhancing business longevity and community impact).\nEtc… \nEnduring value: \nFuture expansion possibility: Online ordering system for larger-scale meal delivery, reducing travel emissions and streamlining distribution.\nSustainable supply chain development—connecting with more local farmers to reduce dependency on imported goods and ensure stable ingredient supply.\n\nHow Al-Eiz Supports Social Sustainability and Community Resilience\nSocial Sustainability & Livelihoods: By providing jobs to widows and vulnerable women, Al-Eiz strengthens economic resilience and offers a stable income source for those affected by conflict. Economic stability at the household level enhances adaptive capacity, making communities more resilient to crises.\nAffordable & Accessible Nutrition: Traditional meals like timmen qouzi and dolma are prepared affordably, ensuring nutritional security for underserved populations, particularly during economic hardship.\n\nTrainer tip: Don’t get stuck on the framework here, there are some blurred lines on what exactly goes where. It is helpful to tell the entrepreneurs that it is just a tool to visualize and think through your product in another way! \n\n\nRecap: A product is a series of features that have some type of benefit.

This is a strategic question that should be based on your persona needs and overall marketing strategy. Make sure that what you are designing will pay off and transition into real sales. For instance, although it might be really cool to print your logo on hats and pens, maybe the business is still too early to benefit from this type of promotion. Maybe because of a limited budget, it is more effective to put that money into making flyers that will be shared over social media.\r\nMake sure to think about what marketing materials will work for your best segment opportunity. \r\n\r\nRecap: These are all things you can be working on creating. You might think it’s too soon to create things like a logo or business card, but actually it is the perfect time! They are so easy to do, and these small details can have a high impact on how people view you. Remind them that they should start creating a logo, business cards, website, Facebook page, and a few informational ads or flyers. You will start to meet people soon and need to start networking. Be memorable. Even if this logo or design changes in the future that is ok, only print a few of these as you test what people like or don’t like. You don’t need much to convince people that you are a legitimate business, but that is what you want to do (even if you aren’t operating yet). You are starting to build brand awareness.\"\"\"\t\"\"\"...Sponsorship Materials\r\nWebsite\r\nCost-Saving Case Studies\r\nCustomer Testimonials\r\nSimple digital tools like a QR code instead of a business card\r\n\r\nWhat’s a good first design for a new business?\r\nThink simple and useful. If you’re just starting out, you don’t need to print everything. Instead of printing business cards, you can use a QR code that links to your LinkedIn or website. This helps:\r\nSave money (no printing costs)\r\nShowcase your brand as modern and efficient\r\nReduce waste (aligns with sustainability values)\r\nAnother example: Instead of printing lots of brochures, try creating a one-page digital flyer that you can send through WhatsApp, email, or social media.\r\nYour first design should help you connect with people and share your business easily.\r\n\r\nRecap: \r\nStart with what will help your business grow right now (logo, website, social media, simple flyers).\r\nYou don’t need to print everything! A QR code or a digital flyer can be just as effective.\r\nThink about your values—if sustainability is important, your design choices should reflect that.\r\n\r\nFacilitator notes:\r\nEncourage simple and practical first design choices for new businesses.\r\nIntroduce QR codes as an alternative to printed business cards.\r\nHelp entrepreneurs think about saving money and reducing waste while still making a strong impression.\"\"\"\n\t11\t11\tAdded New Content\t\"2 examples of poster\"\t\"Replace with something emphasize savings design poster\"\n18.

You can even include things such as discounts, free trials, or offers you will provide any of your customer segments to attract them to your platform. Explain the elements of the document:\r\nPrimary goal: Choose specific and measurable goals that you hope to attain with your marketing efforts, and note them on your one page marketing plan.\r\nAction plan: Strategies very generally state how you plan to reach your goals. For example, if your goal is to increase listeners of your podcast by 3,000 in a year, an example strategy might be to invite well-known people in your industry to be guests on the show. You might also want to have a digital marketing campaign highlighting all those guests on your podcast to get the word out.\r\nTotal cost to implement the plan: Make sure you consider the cost to implement the plan. Thinking this through will help you create a realistic and actionable plan. Consider financial costs, human capital costs, ongoing costs, and one time costs.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will create this strategy 3 times to cover the next 3 years. This is a guideline, if you want to break up the timing in another way that makes more sense for your business and strategy, that is fine. But you should be thinking about now, the near future, and a few years from now. For each time frame, please explain what your plan is to increase awareness of your business and get customers. \r\nCurrent strategy: What are you doing right now to market your business and make sales? What do you need to do to begin to build brand awareness and make actual sales?\r\n6 month - 1 year strategy: What are you doing between 6 months to a year from now. This category should be a bit more ambitious. You should expect to start to gain more traction here!\r\n1 - 3 year strategy: Where do you see yourself in 1-3 years from now? What locations are you in? How will your strategies change as you develop a stronger following?\r\n\r\n40 minutes: Activity\r\nEntrepreneurs should work individually to create a campaign for 1 persona for each of the 3 time frames.\r\nEntrepreneurs should make sure that at least 1 strategy is focused on digital marketing!\r\nEveryone should go to their marketing plan excel document (the same as they used during the graphic design session)\r\nTrainers will be around to help entrepreneurs\r\nThey can go back on Canva and design some posts specifically to achieve this personas goal.\r\nDepending on the energy of the group, you can come back earlier and have entrepreneurs share their work for 10 minutes. If everyone is working hard and making progress, let them continue.\r\n\r\nRecap: There are so many different marketing techniques we can implement. The key to this action plan is figuring out which is the best method to influence a customers purchasing behavior. This will change depending on your customer segment, but again, if you know your customers deeply, this wont be hard. You just have to listen to them! Then you have to create a realistic plan for yourself to stay on track and make sales.\"\"\"\t\"\"\"50 Minutes: Activity\r\n10 minutes: Explain the activity\r\nEveryone should go to their marketing plan Excel document (the same one used during the graphic design session).\r\nMake sure to include:\r\nWho you are targeting\r\nHow you plan on reaching them\r\nHow much it will cost to implement this plan\r\nYour rationale behind the plan\r\nAny discounts, free trials, or offers you will provide to attract your customer segments.\r\nHow your business values and purpose influence your marketing approach.\r\nElements of the Document:\r\nPrimary Goal: Choose specific and measurable goals for your marketing efforts and note them in your one-page marketing plan.\r\nAction Plan: Strategies should outline how you will reach your goals.\r\nExample: If your goal is to increase podcast listeners by 3,000 in a year, you might invite well-known guests and create a digital campaign featuring those guests.\r\nTotal Cost to Implement: Consider financial, human capital, ongoing, and one-time costs to ensure your plan is realistic and actionable.\r\nYou will create this strategy three times to cover the next three years. You can adjust the time frames as needed, but think about now, the near future, and a few years from now.\r\nFor each timeframe, explain how you will:\r\nIncrease awareness of your business\r\nAttract and retain customers\r\nCommunicate your brand’s value and purpose\r\nTime-Based Marketing Strategy\r\nCurrent Strategy (Now):\r\nWhat are you currently doing to market your business and drive sales?\r\nHow are you beginning to build brand awareness?\r\n6 Month - 1 Year Strategy:\r\nHow will you expand your reach?\r\nWhat marketing strategies will help you gain traction?\r\nHow will you refine your messaging to connect with customers?\r\n1 - 3 Year Strategy:\r\nWhere do you see your business in 1-3 years?\r\nHow will your strategies evolve as you build a stronger customer base and brand identity?\r\n40 minutes: Activity\r\nEntrepreneurs should work individually to create a marketing campaign for one customer persona, covering each of the three timeframes.\r\n✅ Ensure at least one strategy focuses on digital marketing!\r\n📌 Steps:\r\nOpen your marketing plan Excel document.\r\nUse Canva to design posts tailored to your persona’s goals.\r\nTrainers will be available to provide support.\r\n💡 Depending on the group’s energy, you can return earlier for a 10-minute share session, or let participants continue if they’re making strong progress.\r\nRecap\r\nThere are many different marketing techniques, but the key is to identify the best way to influence customer behavior.

If these points were covered on the previous slide, just quickly recap them and move on. \r\nResearch, design, and development: All businesses have to do the right research before starting their business. Based on that research, they should design, test, and build out their full set of products/services. \r\nAsk: Did anyone ask me what kind of plane I was interested in? Or what I needed it for? Who will use it? Or what color and design I might like? If you did, you would have gotten a leg up in the exercise because you might have been able to plan better, know how many I wanted, or know which planes I was interested in “buying”. Never forget about how important this step is. Make the time to do the right research to set yourself up for success down the line. \r\nMarketing and sales: Each team had their product evaluated and accepted or rejected from the “market”. Your price was set by the quality of the plan and how it met my needs. Many of you were very clever during your pitch. Some of you targeted emotions, some of you targeted functionality, etc… It would have been really smart if you knew what I wanted the plane for by doing the right research ahead of time to pitch directly to my needs. \r\nProduction and delivery: All of you have great ideas, but if you can’t make and deliver your product/service to the market, then your business will fail! Some planes were priced really high because they were really amazing, but it was too much for them to deliver! Maybe you made a plane, that only one person on the team knew how to make and it was really time consuming. Some of you ran out of raw materials. \r\nAsk: Did anyone experience this? What did you do to get around the challenge? \r\nQuality control: Never forget about quality control! So many of you gave planes that I didn’t want. They were poor quality and I refused to pay for them which cost your business. You should put a system in place to make sure that the quality of your product is ensured at every step. \r\nAsk: Who had a system for quality control? What worked well, what didn’t?\r\n\r\nRecap: At each of these steps, there was an opportunity to make me a happy customer and provide me with value. You can either lower your costs, or you could have made it more tailored to my needs. When developing your product, think about how this design will be produced, shipped, stored, packaged, and more. The design of the product itself is one of the key steps that will determine your supply chain. As you develop a product or service, entrepreneurs should ask themselves how they will actually be able to manage the successful delivery of a product to their customers. To do that, you have to carefully break down each step. \"\"\"\t\"\"\"Discuss what you did as a group and how it is linked to any typical business and its activities.

Some questions you might want to ask to encourage discussion include:\r\nCan someone tell me what they know about ethics?\r\nWhat do ethics look like in the business context? What are ethics in business? \r\nHow are business ethics and high ethical standards linked to business sustainability?\r\nWho are all of the people impacted by your business (stakeholders)? Why is it important to take care of them?\r\n\r\nSome of these points probably came up in the discussion. Maybe someone mentioned following the law as a part of ethics. Or not, so you can bring it up now. \r\nBasically, there are 2 types of ethics:\r\nCompliance based: This is doing the bare minimum. You follow the laws and do what you are supposed to do. The idea here is not to do any harm. However, sometimes the laws might not be perfect and still do harm. This is difficult because laws are different in different locations because of cultural differences. What might not be ethical in some cultures (child labor for instance), are perfectly accepted in other places in the world. \r\nDo no harm (hopefully)\r\nFollow laws\r\nFollow guidelines provided by an organization or group telling you what you can and can’t do. \r\nPenalties for violations\r\n\r\nValues based: Because laws aren’t perfect, they leave room for businesses to damage people, communities, and the environment. Based on personal choices and values (without disregarding logical business rationale), you can choose to have your business have a positive impact on society. It takes a bit of extra work, but your business will have an impact on so many people. Some people might argue that you have a moral duty to do good with your business. \r\nDo good. Do more than the minimum legal requirements and expectations to do what you think is right. \r\nCompany core values. Act with your company core values in mind.\r\nSelf regulation. Hold yourself accountable and do good even when nobody’s watching.\r\nExtra effort. Put in a little extra effort to be the best version of your business that can possibly exist.\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Kickoff (2-3 minutes):\r\n\"\"Let's discuss ethics as a foundation for aligning your business with authenticity, purpose, and resilience. Ethics aren’t just rules to follow—they represent your deeper 'why' and drive your business forward, especially in challenging times.\"\"\r\nDiscussion Questions (10 minutes):\r\nWhen someone says 'ethics,' what's the first thing that comes to your mind?\r\nHow can authenticity provide your business with unique advantages that competitors can't easily replicate?\r\nWhat impact does alignment with a founder's deepest values have on business success?\r\nCan you recall a moment when you felt genuinely alive and motivated by your work? How can that kind of energy enhance business performance?\r\nHave you seen examples where businesses succeeded specifically because they stayed true to their core values? What happened?\r\nWho are the stakeholders impacted by your business (customers, employees, local community, environment)? Why does considering their well-being contribute to your long-term success?\r\nEncourage participants to share real examples—situations where businesses either lost trust by cutting corners or built loyalty by sticking firmly to their values.\r\nAs the conversation progresses, highlight the two fundamental approaches to ethics:\r\nWrap-Up Points (2-3 minutes):\r\n\"\"We've talked about two main pathways businesses can take regarding ethics—Compliance-based and Values-based. Let's briefly explore each:\"\"\r\nCompliance-Based Ethics: Playing Safe\r\nDoing what's legally required—meeting regulations and avoiding penalties.\r\nPrimarily focused on avoiding problems and doing no harm.\r\nLimitations: Laws differ by location, and simply following rules doesn't create deeper connections with customers or employees.\r\nValues-Based Ethics: Igniting Purpose\r\nGoing beyond compliance because you have a meaningful purpose and clear core values.\r\nActing authentically, proactively, and ethically—even when nobody is watching—because your 'why' genuinely drives you.\r\nWillingness to put in extra effort aligned with your values, making your work more purposeful and fulfilling.\r\nWhy Values Ignite Your Business:\r\nCustomer Connection: People support businesses whose values align with theirs. Authenticity builds trust, loyalty, and lasting customer relationships.\r\nTeam Loyalty: Employees remain engaged and motivated when their work serves a meaningful purpose beyond financial compensation.\r\nLong-term Resilience: Businesses guided by strong, clear values can more effectively adapt to challenges and thrive amid uncertainty.\r\nCompetitive Edge: Authenticity differentiates your business clearly and powerfully in crowded markets.\r\nClosing Thought:\r\nWe aren't just building startups—we're cultivating purpose-driven businesses that attract customers, inspire communities, and stand the test of time. Ethics, grounded in authenticity and values, can become your a strategic advantage.\r\nAs Epictetus famously said:\r\n\"\"First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to.\"\"\"\n\t-\t4\tAdded New Content\t-\t\"\"\"5 Minutes: Discussion - Ethics: Living Values That Ignite Business Continued\r\nDiscussion Questions (2-3 minutes):\r\nWhat is your strong why?

How can you “activate” the purpose behind your business (instead of just having values that are never worked towards accomplishing)?\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Facilitator Notes (1-2 minutes):\r\nOpen with challenge: \"\"Every business claims values like these on their website. But when do these words actually matter? What makes the difference between empty statements and values that guide real decisions?\"\"\r\nQuick example: McDonald's painted arches green and added salads, claiming environmental values—but their core business remains unchanged\"\"\r\nGo To Slide 10\"\"\"\n\t-\t9\tAdded New Content\t-\t\"\"\"FROM WORDS TO PURPOSE\r\nFacilitator notes:\n\r\nFacilitator Notes (2-3 minutes):\r\nDiscuss: \"\"Think about your stated values.

That's where we're headed next.\"\"\"\"\"\n\t11\t14\tUpdated Wording in Slides\t\"\"\"HIGH STANDARDS\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\r\n\r\nSo how do the companies who are doing great legitimate work stand out from the others? Because of case studies like Unilever, being ethical or “green” is trendy now. There are so many people “greenwashing” to get good press to make people think they are doing good so that it will have a positive impact on their sales. \r\nAsk: Where have you seen this before? How are people faking ethics?\r\nGreen packaging or packaging with plants on it. \r\nCompanies that say one thing and do another.\r\nNatural gas/hydraulic fracking companies that advertise “clean” energy (it burns clean, but extracting it is very harmful for the environment).\r\n\r\nAsk: Given the fact that everyone wants to appear ethical, how do you stand out from the others? How do you separate the fakers from the people actually doing good work?\r\nActually do good things with evidence\r\nPut policies and procedures into place and enforce them\r\n3rd party product certifications:\r\nISO\r\nLEEDS certified\r\nOrganic\r\nFair trade\r\nRainforest alliance\r\nB certified\r\nEtc…\r\nHave these standards to avoid greenwashing “marketing”\"\"\"\t\"\"\"LIVING YOUR VALUES, NOT JUST MARKETING THEM\r\n\nFacilitator Notes (5 minutes: Discussion)\r\n\"\"We've talked about finding values that truly matter to you and activating them through the triple bottom line. But in a world where 'ethical' and 'green' have become marketing buzzwords, how do businesses that genuinely live their values stand out from those just wearing the costume?\"\"\r\nTransition: This disconnect between what companies claim and what they do has a name: 'greenwashing' or 'ethics washing.' It happens when values become marketing tools rather than authentic guides for decisions.\r\nAsk: \"\"How can your business demonstrate that your values run deeper than marketing? How do you build trust that your 'why' is genuine?\"\"\r\nGuide toward concrete answers:\r\n\"\"Make choices that might cost you something in the short term but align with your values\"\"\r\n\"\"Be transparent about both your successes and challenges\"\"\r\n\"\"Invite verification through certification programs relevant to your sector:\"\"\r\nISO standards for quality and environmental management\r\nOrganic certification for food products\r\nFair Trade for ethical supply chains\r\nB Corporation certification for overall social and environmental performance\r\n\r\n\r\nConnect back to meaning: The strongest businesses don't just meet standards—they set them based on what truly matters to them. When values come from an authentic source of meaning, customers don't just see compliance—they feel your authentic purpose and builds loyalty that marketing can't buy.\r\nApplication: Now, thinking about your specific business and the values we've been discussing, what's one concrete action you could take this month that would demonstrate your commitment isn't just talk?\"\"\"\n\t12\t15\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\t\"\"\"1 hour and 15 minutes: Activity\r\n\r\nThink about your core values and the ideas we shared before. What will you do to accomplish your mission? How will you really accomplish those things and have an ACTIVATED BRAND PURPOSE? What problem is your business really solving? Think about your customers/employees/community needs and how you can best support them. Based on your mission statement and care values, what are 3 things you want to change in the world? You will create a system to create and measure your impact. You can measure impact in a lot of ways! Feel free to measure anything you want, but make sure you are measuring impact in a way that is aligned with your mission and business! If you are able to track what you are doing, you can make an impact report that would be useful to share with donors, investors, or even put on your website and share with your customers!\r\nWhat we will do now is look at a well known certification assessment that will help you evaluate your impact on all of the different stakeholders. \r\n\r\n1 hour: Activity\r\nFor the rest of the session, take each of these categories and list how you can impact each of these stakeholder groups. \r\nTake a B Impact Assessment for your business: https://app.bimpactassessment.net/login\r\nYou probably wont know all the answers to these questions, that is ok. It will help give you ideas to incorporate into your strategy and help you see where your business stands.\r\nKeep in mind, you need an 80 to pass and it is not an easy test to pass!\r\n\r\n 15 minutes: Share\r\nBreak into small groups of 3-5 people\r\nDiscuss the different strategies you thought of and get feedback from the group\r\nAre the ways they are choosing to measure impact aligned with their mission?\r\nShare ideas to help each business come up with really unique strategies to make a difference based on their particular business model!\"\"\"\t\"\"\"(5 minutes: Introduction & Set-Up)\r\nClearly connect this activity to the previous discussions:\r\nWe've talked extensively about ethics, authenticity, and avoiding greenwashing/values washing. Now it’s time to put this into action. Real business ethics means aligning what you say (your values) with what you actually do. Let's move beyond words and create a concrete, measurable way to activate your brand purpose.\r\nGuiding Questions (for entrepreneurs):\r\nWhat problem are you genuinely solving?\r\nWho benefits directly from your solution (customers, employees, community)?\r\nBased on your authentic core values, what three meaningful impacts do you want your business to have in the world?\r\nActivity Instructions (1 hour):\r\nClearly list your core values and your deeper \"\"why\"\" behind your business.\r\nIdentify at least three measurable actions your business can take that authentically embody these values and positively impact your stakeholders (People, Planet, Profit).\r\nDescribe specific ways you will measure and communicate these impacts:\r\nConsider customer surveys, storytelling, transparency initiatives, and formal impact reports.\r\nExplore widely recognized third-party certifications and assessments, such as:\r\nISO standards\r\nFair Trade Certification\r\nOrganic Certification\r\nLEED Certification\r\nRainforest Alliance\r\nB Corporation Certification\r\nTake the B Impact Assessment:\r\nLog in or create an account at B Impact Assessment.\r\nWork through the questions relevant to your business. It's okay if you don't know all the answers yet—use this as a tool to identify areas where you can integrate stronger practices and measurements aligned with your values.\r\nNote: A score of 80 or above indicates passing, and it is a challenging benchmark!\r\nGroup Activity (15 minutes: Small Group Discussions)\r\nBreak into groups of 3-5.\r\nShare your identified impacts, strategies, and measurement ideas.\r\nProvide and receive feedback: Are these strategies aligned clearly with your core mission and values? Are they realistically achievable and measurable?\r\nTrainer Tip: Encourage entrepreneurs to focus deeply on practical and meaningful metrics—ones that genuinely resonate with investors, customers, and stakeholders, demonstrating authenticity beyond superficial marketing.\"\"\"\n29.

Here are some tips on what to ask in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of a user interview:\r\n\r\nBeginning: In the beginning of the interview, you should ask opening questions to set people at ease and build rapport. You should not ask about sensitive topics. Instead, focus on setting the stage and bringing your interviewees on board so they’re comfortable enough to be, and remain, open with you. What you do at this stage can include the following:\r\nTelling participants what topics will be covered\r\nTelling participants how their data will be used\r\nAsking innocuous questions such as what their role is in their organization\r\nAsking concrete questions that are easy to answer\r\n\r\nMiddle: In the middle of the interview, you’re hitting high gear. Having established a direct channel with your interviewees (the users), you move on and ask the bulk of your questions, but maybe not in the order you had originally planned. Remember to:\r\nKeep the flow of the conversation as natural as possible, but cover the topics you want to cover.\r\nPick up on what participants have said earlier and get full replies to questions they have only partially answered.\r\nSteer participants back on track if they go too far off topic.\r\nShow that you have been listening.\r\nGo deeper where necessary\r\n\r\nEnd: At the end of the interview, you wrap up in a way that makes participants feel as though they have said what they wanted to say and that their answers are valuable. By this point, you will have managed to tie up any loose ends on matters that had not been clear before, and both you and they should be satisfied that the interview has brought all the issues out into the open. Things you should do include:\r\nAsking if there is anything participants would like to add.\r\nTelling your participants what you are going to do with their data and what the value is for them.\r\nThanking them for taking the time to help with your research. Above all, remember to conduct a pilot study before you start approaching real-life participants and tackling ‘organic’ interview settings. Also, always be sensitive to the fact that people are different and need different things!\r\"\t\"Effective Questions:\n- \"\"Tell me about your decision-making process...\"\"\n- \"\"What matters most when choosing [product/service]?\"\"\n- \"\"What challenges do you face with current solutions?\"\"\n- \"\"How do you evaluate different options?\"\"\n\nAvoid:\n- Leading questions about specific features\n- Yes/no questions about purchasing\n- Questions that assume user needs\nFacilitator Notes:\n\nFocus on open-ended questions that reveal genuine insights\nLet participants develop questions relevant to their business\nIf efficiency or cost topics arise, explore naturally\nTime: 10 minutes practice\nEncourage questions that uncover real user needs and behaviors\"\n\t17\t17\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\t\"SAYS: “I love Asiacell because I never have a bad experience.”\n“I want something reliable.”\n“I don’t understand what to do from here.”\n\nTHINKS: “This is really annoying.”\r\n“Am I dumb for not understanding this?”\r\n\nDOES: Refreshes page several times.\r\nShops around to compare prices.\r\n\nFEELS: Impatient: pages load too slowly\r\nConfused: too many contradictory prices\r\nWorried: they are doing something wrong\"\t\"SAYS:\n\"\"I need something reliable\"\"\n\"\"Price is important but so is quality\"\"\n\"\"I want something that lasts\"\"\n\nTHINKS:\n\"\"Is this worth the investment?\"\"\n\"\"Will this solve my problem?\"\"\n\"\"Can I trust this solution?\"\"\n\nDOES:\nCompares options\nResearches before buying\nAsks others for recommendations\n\nFEELS:\nConcerned about making right choice\nWants value for money\nSeeks reliable solutions\n\nFacilitator Notes:\n\nKeep focus on understanding genuine user perspectives\nEncourage deep understanding of user decision-making\nAllow cost and reliability discussions to emerge naturally\nTime: 8 minutes brainstorming\nUse examples relevant to local context\"\n\t19\t19\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\tWhen conducting user interviews, make sure to include extreme users.

The site includes three main pages:\n\n1. **Homepage** - Provides an overview of the project with accurate statistics about modules enhanced, slides added, and tools created. It highlights your \"business-first\" approach rather than explicit climate framing, focusing on efficiency, risk management, and values alignment as business advantages.\n\n2. **Ignite Pre-Incubator Enhancements** - Details the changes made to the foundational entrepreneurship program, showing specific examples of how you integrated resource efficiency and resilience concepts into user research, market analysis, and idea generation.\n\n3. **Incubator Program Enhancements** - Showcases the more extensive changes to the advanced business training program, organized by featured modules and thematic areas (business model, operations, values, risk management).\n\n4. **New Tools & Frameworks** - Highlights the practical tools you created, including the Business Efficiency Workbook, Risk Assessment Process, Green Funding Opportunities Guide, Extreme User Interview Framework, and Business Viability Matrix.\n\nKey improvements over the original dashboard:\n\n1. **Accurate representation of your approach** - The new site focuses on the business benefits of efficiency and resilience rather than explicit climate messaging, matching your actual integration strategy.\n\n2. **Concrete examples instead of abstract scores** - Rather than arbitrary scoring, the site showcases specific examples of changes you made to slides, discussions, and frameworks.\n\n3. **Emphasis on practical tools** - The site highlights the actual worksheets and frameworks you created, showing how they provide tangible business benefits.\n\n4. **Local context integration** - References to Iraqi examples, funding sources, and business conditions are included throughout.\n\nThe site is designed with a clean, professional aesthetic that maintains the green color scheme while focusing on the business value of the enhancements you made. Each page includes specific before/after examples to illustrate the meaningful improvements you implemented.",

It highlights your \"business-first\" approach rather than explicit climate framing, focusing on efficiency, risk management, and values alignment as business advantages.\n\n2. **Ignite Pre-Incubator Enhancements** - Details the changes made to the foundational entrepreneurship program, showing specific examples of how you integrated resource efficiency and resilience concepts into user research, market analysis, and idea generation.\n\n3. **Incubator Program Enhancements** - Showcases the more extensive changes to the advanced business training program, organized by featured modules and thematic areas (business model, operations, values, risk management).\n\n4. **New Tools & Frameworks** - Highlights the practical tools you created, including the Business Efficiency Workbook, Risk Assessment Process, Green Funding Opportunities Guide, Extreme User Interview Framework, and Business Viability Matrix.\n\nKey improvements over the original dashboard:\n\n1. **Accurate representation of your approach** - The new site focuses on the business benefits of efficiency and resilience rather than explicit climate messaging, matching your actual integration strategy.\n\n2. **Concrete examples instead of abstract scores** - Rather than arbitrary scoring, the site showcases specific examples of changes you made to slides, discussions, and frameworks.\n\n3. **Emphasis on practical tools** - The site highlights the actual worksheets and frameworks you created, showing how they provide tangible business benefits.\n\n4. **Local context integration** - References to Iraqi examples, funding sources, and business conditions are included throughout.\n\nThe site is designed with a clean, professional aesthetic that maintains the green color scheme while focusing on the business value of the enhancements you made. Each page includes specific before/after examples to illustrate the meaningful improvements you implemented.",

The content seems to be duplicated or mixed up - there's a complete HTML document followed by what appears to be additional module cards without proper HTML structure.\n\nLet me review the current situation and then fix the Ignite page:\n\n## Current Assessment\n\n**Pros:**\n- The overall design is clean and visually appealing\n- The content accurately reflects the changes you made to the curriculum\n- The before/after examples effectively demonstrate the integration approach\n- The navigation between pages is well-structured\n\n**Cons:**\n- There's duplication in the HTML - it looks like Module 5 appears first, then Modules 2, 4, 6, and 7 appear later\n- The HTML structure is broken at the bottom\n- The \"all-modules\" tab content is incomplete\n- Some content may be missing due to the clipping\n\n## Understanding Your Goal and Intent\n\nBased on your work, I believe your goals are to:\n1. Create an accurate representation of the curriculum enhancements you made\n2. Highlight the business-first approach rather than explicit climate framing\n3. Showcase concrete examples of your changes rather than abstract metrics\n4. Present a professional, coherent dashboard that would be useful for stakeholders\n\nLet me create a fixed, complete version of the Ignite Program page:\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n\n\nI've fixed the Ignite Program page by:\n\n1. Organizing the content properly - I kept the complete HTML structure but reorganized the module cards so they appear in a logical order\n2. Adding Module 5 (Reframe) in the right position\n3. Completing the \"All Modules\" tab with properly structured content for all modules\n4. Adding Module 8 (Your Brand) which was missing\n5. Ensuring consistency throughout the document\n\nThis revised page now provides a clean, complete representation of the Ignite Program enhancements. The organization follows a logical flow and maintains the professional aesthetic of the rest of the dashboard.\n\nSome additional suggestions to enhance the website even further:\n\n1. **Add a search function**: This would allow users to quickly find specific modules or enhancement types across the entire curriculum\n\n2. **Include downloadable resources**: Add links to download the actual worksheets you created (Business Efficiency Workbook, Risk Assessment Process, etc.)\n\n3. **Interactive examples**: For key changes like the enhanced competitive benchmarking, consider making these sections interactive so users can toggle between before/after views\n\n4. **Success stories**: Include brief case studies of entrepreneurs who have benefited from these enhancements\n\n5. **Feedback mechanism**: Add a way for users to provide feedback or ask questions about implementing these concepts\n\nOverall, the dashboard effectively communicates the comprehensive, practical approach you took to enhancing Five One Labs' entrepreneurship curriculum. It emphasizes the business benefits of efficiency, resilience, and values alignment rather than explicit climate messaging, which aligns perfectly with your integration strategy.",

Organizing the content properly - I kept the complete HTML structure but reorganized the module cards so they appear in a logical order\n2. Adding Module 5 (Reframe) in the right position\n3. Completing the \"All Modules\" tab with properly structured content for all modules\n4. Adding Module 8 (Your Brand) which was missing\n5. Ensuring consistency throughout the document\n\nThis revised page now provides a clean, complete representation of the Ignite Program enhancements. The organization follows a logical flow and maintains the professional aesthetic of the rest of the dashboard.\n\nSome additional suggestions to enhance the website even further:\n\n1. **Add a search function**: This would allow users to quickly find specific modules or enhancement types across the entire curriculum\n\n2. **Include downloadable resources**: Add links to download the actual worksheets you created (Business Efficiency Workbook, Risk Assessment Process, etc.)\n\n3. **Interactive examples**: For key changes like the enhanced competitive benchmarking, consider making these sections interactive so users can toggle between before/after views\n\n4. **Success stories**: Include brief case studies of entrepreneurs who have benefited from these enhancements\n\n5. **Feedback mechanism**: Add a way for users to provide feedback or ask questions about implementing these concepts\n\nOverall, the dashboard effectively communicates the comprehensive, practical approach you took to enhancing Five One Labs' entrepreneurship curriculum. It emphasizes the business benefits of efficiency, resilience, and values alignment rather than explicit climate messaging, which aligns perfectly with your integration strategy.",

The business-first approach is still the central focus, and the improvements maintain the professional, clean aesthetic while making the page more functional and user-friendly.\n\nWould you like me to make any additional changes or improvements to this homepage design?",

Once that fundamental point is clear, then you can create all that other material to help you visualize your brand.\n1\n\nSESSION OBJECTIVES:\nUnderstand how to use your brand to communicate.\n\nDefine your unique value proposition.\n\nWrite mission and vision statements for your brand. \n1 minute: Objectives\nUnderstand how to use your brand to communicate: You’ve gathered all this information, now we are going to try and define our business in a way that will resonate with your customer base.\nDefine your unique value proposition: Pinpoint the key area of your business that makes you unique.\nWrite your mission and vision statements for your business:  This is to have a clear written mission that is aligned with your brand. \n\n2\n\nYOUR BRAND\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What are the different elements of a brand? What defines a brand? What do you think of when we talk about a brand?\nPotential answers:\nCreative elements (logo, colors, marketing, etc…)\nBig companies\nConsistency\nThe name of the market or product\nThe image that comes to mind when people interact with your brand\nGood quality, (or bad quality)\nUnique\nHas creative elements (logo, name, color or font scheme, etc…)\nA company’s environmental and social commitments\nHow responsible or sustainable a brand is perceived to be\n Follow-up Question: How do you see sustainability influencing customer perceptions of a brand?\n\nSummary: A brand is more than just visuals; it is the overall perception customers have, shaped by consistency, quality, and increasingly, sustainability. Businesses that integrate environmental and social responsibility into their brand often attract conscious consumers and enhance their competitiveness.\n3\n\n“A brand is defined by a customers overall perception of your business.”\nWHAT IS THIS?\n8 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What does this apple mean? \nPotential answers:\nHigh quality\nProfessional\nHigh tech\nInternational\nIntelligence\nInnovation\nSteve Jobs\nI phone\nIOS\nExpensive\nMobile phones + other products like computers and tablets\nFun or games\nSneaky or annoying sometimes \nMoney driven company\nSecurity\nTrustworthy\n\nSummary: I showed you a picture of an apple, and so much came to your mind. You mentioned the products that Apple has, their founder, that they are expensive, you all have stories about this brand and feeling around it. I can show this picture to people all around the world, and there will probably be a similar response. That is a strong brand! \n\nAsk: Why is having a strong brand so important?\nPotential answers:\nIt is the identity of your business\nIt is how you will be remembered\nYou want a good brand identity, not a bad one!\nMaintaining a positive brand image is important because it will have a lasting impression on customers! They don’t forget easily and they have power!\nYou can sell a brand, not only a product\nThe strategy and actions of a business could be good or bad. These actions will define your brand and will make an impact over the next several years.\n\nRecap: Having a brand is really important for a business. It helps customers differentiate you from the competitors and remember you for what you are good at. What do we want our customers to think about when they interact with our products?\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A BRAND?\nQuality\nProducts and services\nCreative elements\nMessage\nA brand is consistent in its:\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: What is a brand\nLet people answer freely, then cover these points below as well: \nQuality: iPhones are great quality. We know this because it is consistently true. I would never buy an iPhone and question the quality of it. It is the same in every box in every country (unless it is a fake product). \nProducts and services: Apple is consistent in their products and services as well. They are a technology company. I know that they won’t be coming out with furniture or kitchenware. That would make for a very confusing brand. When creating a brand, make sure you are consistent in the things you offer as well.\nCreative elements: Commercials, marketing materials, office layout, website, Facebook, and more! Everything is in line with the same creative elements. There is a consistency with color and font schemes. Logos use and all creative elements are consistent. \nYou saw the Apple logo and knew what it was immediately. If someone took another icon of a fruit with a bite in it, many of us will think of Apple. That is a strong brand! \nMessage: Your message is consistent across all channels, internally, and externally. Whether it is your commercials, the writing on your packaging, blogs that you write, your company culture, or anything else, your message is clear and consistent. What is the problem you are solving? What does your business do? Make sure those things are clear.\n\nRecap: Apply your branding across your business and evolve it as you grow. As you grow and expand, you want to make it as easy as possible for people to know exactly what you do. If you do too much, or aren’t consistent in these points, you make it hard for people to recognize you out of the crowd.\n\n5 minutes: Brief activity\nFor each of the logos, discuss if they have a good brand or not. Try to touch on all of the four points mentioned on the slide.\n\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat is a unique value proposition?\nPotential answers could be:\nSomething that makes you unique\nA clear statement to describe what you do\nThe key offerings of your business\nIt is the point that differentiates you from your competitors\nShows why your product is better than other in the market\n\n6\n\n“A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you”\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nState the definition of a value proposition and connect it to their ideas from before.\nAsk: \n How can we actually get to our unique value proposition? Does anyone have an idea? (What makes you stand out—whether it’s pricing, durability, or an extra benefit like helping customers save resources?) - The answers here will frame the next slides.\nPotential answers:\nWe get it from our research\nUsers have to tell us\nWe have to look at what is already in the market\nLook at competitors to see what they are offering and what they are good at\nWe look at our business idea and what we are good at\nWe consider whether sustainability can be a unique differentiator (e.g., eco-friendly materials, ethical supply chains, low-carbon operations, waste reduction).\n \n Discussion Prompt: Could sustainability be a part of your Unique Value Proposition? If yes, how?\n\nRecap: Over the past month, you guys have been doing a ton of research. You have done a deep dive into the market to try to identify gaps and areas of opportunity. You now know 3 important factors needed to define our UVP:\nWhat you and your business are good at\nWhat the market wants and needs\nWhat competitors are offering\n Additional Consideration: Some businesses differentiate themselves by being the \"green alternative.\" Think about how sustainability could enhance your value proposition.\n\nYour business \nand what you \ndo well\nThe market \nand customers needs \n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo first there is you. You all came in here with business ideas and you want to see if there is a market for it. You have certain:\nCapabilities\nInterests\nInformation\nA business idea \nSkills\nExperience\n\nBut you also have the market. The market has:\nPeople with changing needs, wants, desires, frustrations, etc…\nThe market can be big or small\nYour market is where you can actually reach, so it can be limited geographically\nEtc…\n\nWhat we are searching for this month, is to see if people want your idea. Based on your capabilities of developing and delivering a product, will people want what you have? And the next question, is there enough people who want it? \nThrough the animation of the circles, show:\nThe more overlap between your business idea and the needs of the market means that there is more potential for your business to succeed. \nWhen there is a small overlap (a small number of people in the market interested in your idea), there is a smaller market potential. This could be considered a niche market.\nMake sure the size of the market is worth your time and energy! Ask yourself, “is this enough for me? Will I be satisfied from the returns of this market?”\n\nYour business \nand what you\ndo well\nThe market \nand customers\nneeds\nCompetitors\nUNIQUE \nVALUE PROPOSITION\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBut there is one more thing. The market also has something else, competitors! They:\nSell other things similar to yours\nServing your customers needs now!\nDon’t serve the needs of the whole market \nYou won’t ever have the whole market\n\nBecause not everyone's needs are being met. There is an opportunity to meet those customers needs and differentiate yourself from your competitors. \n\nAsk: Based on this visual, where should you focus your energy?\nOverlap between competitors and you: Don’t go here! The market doesn’t show any desire for these things! Don’t waste your energy or time.\nOverlap between competitors and market: You could try to go here, but it could be dangerous. You are competing with your competitors on something they are really good at, and you are not good at. You might be seen as a less desirable option to your customers. Or it will take some time to be a strong competitor.\nOverlap between the three circles: This is somehow the bare minimum. Customers want it, competitors do it, and you have the capabilities for it. You should probably be doing this too. \nOverlap between you and the market: This is where you will find your unique value proposition. Customers want it, but the competitors aren’t offering it! Here is where you can really add value and differentiate yourself from your competitors.\n\nWhy choose you?\n\nWHERE DO YOU CREATE UNIQUE VALUE?\nCheaper price?\nFaster service?\nHigher quality?\n10 minutes: Discussion + Activity\n\nAsk: Keeping what we just talked about in mind, what are your value propositions? What is the promise of value you will deliver to your customers? The primary reason customers buy from you instead of your competitor?\nTake some time to think about the UVP, then have everyone share their answers.\nTrainer note: Make sure they are not just explaining their product, listing features, or creating a slogan.\n\nOther examples you can bring up if needed:\nNike offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, customization, and brand/status (https://www.cleverism.com/company/nike/).\nThe value proposition of MailChimp that they offer is simple, direct, and bold.\nApple's Iphone value proposition, offers a unique experience\nUber's value proposition, offers uber convenience (https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples)\n10\n\nPOSITIONING STATEMENT TEMPLATE:\n(Target Personas)\n(Product Name)\n(Category)\n(Key Customer Benefit)\n(Nearest Competitive Alternatives)\nIs the one\nthat\nunlike\nTO\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation of Positioning statement and difference from UVP\nYour Positioning statement is a way to take your UVP and engage your customers. You are speaking to them in this statement. \nThe UVP and positioning statements are rooted in a clear understanding of your customers and what drives them emotionally\nA UVP shows what differentiates your product from your competitors’ products/services and makes it special.\nYour positioning statement captures the space you want to own in your customer’s mind, based on the unique value that you can offer.\nIf sustainability is a part of your business model, your positioning statement can reflect that.\n Trainer Notes:\n Encourage participants to think about whether sustainability could be a key differentiator in their positioning.\n Sustainability-driven positioning can help businesses attract customers who prioritize eco-friendly products and responsible brands.\n\n\nTO all global travelers, (Tourism App) is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: To all global travelers, Tourism App is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\n\n12\n\nMISSION & VALUES\n10 minutes: Discussion\n\nMission, vision, and values\nSo, what are mission, vision, and value statements? What is the difference between them? \nWrite out their thoughts on the board separating mission and values\nMission statement: A Mission statement describes why the organization exists and why it does what it does.\nUsually is bigger than the organization itself\nMany times mission is “unrealistic”\nCan also reflect environmental and social commitments (e.g., Patagonia’s mission: “We’re in business to save our home planet”).\n\nValue statement: A value statement describes and lists the fundamental values and principles that the organization operates by.\nCompany focused\nWhere you hope to see the business down the line\nProduct related\nCan highlight sustainability commitments (e.g., responsible sourcing, reducing waste, ethical labor practices).\n\nEntrepreneurs might bring up vision statements as well. A vision statement describes the ideal future state of the organization.  It articulates what the organization is trying to accomplish.\n\nAsk: Why is it important to have clearly defined mission, vision, and value statements? (Customers care about consistency, trust, and whether a business is ethical, efficient, or innovative.)\nHave a discussion and write down all the thoughts on the board.\nPotential answers:\nStay focused on what is really important,\nBusinesses should be able to clearly talk about what they are trying to achieve (on a grander scale),\nThey should have a statement to show why they exist,\nHaving a clear statement provides direction for employees and management, \nKeeps businesses accountable for their environmental and social impact.\nHelps brands build long-term customer loyalty by aligning with sustainability values.\nKeeps your business customer/solution oriented instead of just focusing on profits,\nCommunicate the company’s beliefs to employees, customers, partners, and the general public,\nEstablish an identity, start a corporate culture,\nAttract like-minded employees,\nAid in the decision-making process (use the mission to reflect on the companies greater goals),\nKeeps you thinking about the future (great leaders/organizations always are)!\n\n13\n\n“We create happiness by providing the finest in entertainment for people of all ages, everywhere”\n“To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful”\n“Simplify life for people around the world”\nMISSION STATEMENTS:\n“We are synergizing green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues.”\n20 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\n8 minutes: Mission statements\nAsk: Take a look at these famous company mission statements. What do you see among all of them? \nPotential answers:\nMany people might reiterate some points from before\nNone of these missions state the products/services they sell\nIt is the end goal for the customers\nThey fulfill their “why”, their purpose, through their products and services\n\n10-15 minutes: Activity\nWrite your mission! So, what is it that you want to accomplish? Don’t think about money, don’t think about sustainable answers, or anything else. If you could see a change in the world, what would that look like?\nHave a few people read out their missions if they want to\n\nOther examples of mission statements:\nAmazon's mission hints at its world-ruling ambitions: \"It's our goal to be Earth's most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything online.“\nFacebook's mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.“\nUber has a simple, bold, mission: \"Transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone.“\nTwitter's mission is \"To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.“\nDropbox’s mission is to “simplify life for people around the world.\"\n14\n\nDETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\nInnovation\nTeamwork\nCommitment\n15 minutes: Activity\n\nActivity: What do you value?\nGive out the list of verbs\nEach entrepreneur should take about 5 minutes to choose all of the verbs that represent their business,\nGo around the room and ask how many people have circled\nSome people will have few values chosen which shows that they might have a clear picture and a focus already\nSome people might have chosen almost all of them. In this case, point out that it is great to have so many values; however, it is hard for one business to represent them all.\nGive the entrepreneurs 3 more minutes to choose only five.\n 5 minutes: Add a verb to each\nExamples: Live adventurously, create curiosity, build independence, etc…\n\nMultiply, promote, act, find, search for, establish, think, listen, laugh, hold, encourage, have, be, practice, unite, \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nShould I pick my values or company values? As the founder of your company, your values should be intertwined with your company values to a degree. The leadership of your company should embody the mission and values your company projects to the world. \nCan this change? Yes it can change; however, try to think of long lasting values that will help shape your company and its culture. These values should last far into the future. If these values are not in line with your customers and their needs, you might face problems. \n15\n\nDETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\nIntegrity\nResponsibility\nSustainability\n15 minutes: Activity\n\nActivity: What do you value?\nGive out the list of verbs\nEach entrepreneur should take about 5 minutes to choose all of the verbs that represent their business,\nGo around the room and ask how many people have circled\nSome people will have few values chosen which shows that they might have a clear picture and a focus already\nSome people might have chosen almost all of them.

      "content": " I'll help you refine Session 8 (Building a Brand) to better integrate your green approach, focusing on values as sources of meaning rather than just a word list exercise. This aligns with Joe Edelman's perspective that values should be rooted in what creates meaningful experiences for people.\n\n## Overall Approach Recommendations\n\nThe current \"Building a Brand\" session uses a standard corporate approach to values (selecting words from a list), which doesn't create the deep connection to meaning that drives authentic action. Here's how we can transform it:\n\n### 1. Shift from Values as Words to Values as Sources of Meaning\n\nThe current approach asks entrepreneurs to select value words from a list, which often results in generic corporate values (integrity, innovation, etc.) that don't necessarily guide authentic action or connect deeply with customers.\n\n**Recommended Change:** \n- Replace the value word selection exercise with a meaning-based exploration\n- Focus on identifying situations where entrepreneurs and their potential customers experience what matters most to them\n- Connect these meaningful experiences to the business's potential positive impact\n\n### 2. Connect Values to the Business Efficiency Framework\n\nYour green integration approach focuses on practical business benefits rather than abstract environmental messaging. We should maintain this focus.\n\n**Recommended Change:**\n- Show how values alignment creates business efficiency (reduced customer acquisition costs, stronger loyalty, better employee retention)\n- Demonstrate how values-driven businesses can reduce risks by attracting more stable customer relationships\n- Emphasize the competitive advantage of authentic values alignment\n\n## Specific Slide Improvements\n\n### Slide 2: YOUR BRAND (Discussion Slide)\n\n**Current:** Basic discussion about brand elements\n\n**Improved Version:**\n```\nYOUR BRAND\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What defines a truly meaningful brand? What brands do you personally connect with and why?\n\nPotential answers:\n- Brands that solve real problems in my life\n- Brands that share my values about what matters\n- Brands that help me live better according to what I care about\n- Brands that are transparent and authentic\n- Brands that help me be more efficient with resources\n- Brands that respect my values and priorities\n\nFollow-up Question: How do these meaningful connections create business advantages like customer loyalty and word-of-mouth marketing?\n\nSummary: A brand is more than logo and visuals—it's a relationship based on shared values and meaningful experiences. When customers connect with your brand on a values level, they become advocates, reducing marketing costs and building resilience against market shifts.\n```\n\n### Slide 11-12: MISSION & VALUES (Discussion Slide)\n\n**Current:** Conventional mission/values discussion with some green elements\n\n**Improved Version:**\n```\nMISSION & VALUES: SOURCES OF MEANING\n\n10 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What makes work meaningful for you personally? When have you felt most fulfilled in your work?\n\nFacilitator notes:\n- Guide discussion toward meaningful experiences, not abstract concepts\n- Encourage examples of when entrepreneurs felt their work mattered\n- Connect these meaningful experiences to potential customer experiences\n\nKey Discussion Points:\n- Mission as shared purpose: What meaningful difference are you and your customers trying to make together?\n- Values as sources of meaning: What situations create meaningful experiences for you and your customers?\n- Authenticity matters: Customers can detect when values are just marketing vs. truly lived\n\nExamples:\n- Patagonia's mission isn't \"sustainability\" (an abstract word), but \"We're in business to save our home planet\" (a meaningful purpose)\n- Their values show up in repair services and \"Don't Buy This Jacket\" campaigns\n- This creates business advantages: lower marketing costs, higher customer loyalty, resilience to price competition\n```\n\n### Slides 14-15: DETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES (Activity)\n\n**Current:** Selection from a values word list\n\n**Improved Value Discovery Exercise:**\n```\nDISCOVER YOUR MEANINGFUL VALUES\n\n20 minutes: Activity\n\nIntroduction: \"Instead of selecting abstract value words, let's discover what truly creates meaning for you and your customers.\"\n\nStep 1: Meaningful Moments (5 min)\n- Write down 2-3 moments when you felt your work was truly meaningful\n- What made these moments matter to you?\n\nStep 2: Customer Meaning (5 min)\n- Based on your research, when do your customers experience meaningful moments related to your product/service?\n- What conditions or situations create meaning for them?\n\nStep 3: Business Advantages (5 min)\n- How could aligning with these sources of meaning:\n  * Reduce your marketing costs?\n  * Strengthen customer loyalty?\n  * Differentiate you from competitors?\n  * Create operational efficiencies?\n\nStep 4: Express Your Values (5 min)\n- Create value statements that express the conditions that create meaning\n- Example: \"We create opportunities for families to connect through shared outdoor experiences\" (vs. generic \"Family\" or \"Connection\")\n```\n\n### New Slide: VALUES-DRIVEN BUSINESS ADVANTAGES\n\n```\nVALUES-DRIVEN BUSINESS ADVANTAGES\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nExplain: \"When values are authentic sources of meaning, they create concrete business benefits:\"\n\n1. Lower Customer Acquisition Costs\n   - Customers who share your values become advocates\n   - Word-of-mouth reduces marketing expenses\n\n2. Operational Efficiencies\n   - Values alignment reduces waste (doing only what matters)\n   - Staff motivated by meaningful work are more productive\n\n3.

            "text": " I'll help you refine Session 8 (Building a Brand) to better integrate your green approach, focusing on values as sources of meaning rather than just a word list exercise. This aligns with Joe Edelman's perspective that values should be rooted in what creates meaningful experiences for people.\n\n## Overall Approach Recommendations\n\nThe current \"Building a Brand\" session uses a standard corporate approach to values (selecting words from a list), which doesn't create the deep connection to meaning that drives authentic action. Here's how we can transform it:\n\n### 1. Shift from Values as Words to Values as Sources of Meaning\n\nThe current approach asks entrepreneurs to select value words from a list, which often results in generic corporate values (integrity, innovation, etc.) that don't necessarily guide authentic action or connect deeply with customers.\n\n**Recommended Change:** \n- Replace the value word selection exercise with a meaning-based exploration\n- Focus on identifying situations where entrepreneurs and their potential customers experience what matters most to them\n- Connect these meaningful experiences to the business's potential positive impact\n\n### 2. Connect Values to the Business Efficiency Framework\n\nYour green integration approach focuses on practical business benefits rather than abstract environmental messaging. We should maintain this focus.\n\n**Recommended Change:**\n- Show how values alignment creates business efficiency (reduced customer acquisition costs, stronger loyalty, better employee retention)\n- Demonstrate how values-driven businesses can reduce risks by attracting more stable customer relationships\n- Emphasize the competitive advantage of authentic values alignment\n\n## Specific Slide Improvements\n\n### Slide 2: YOUR BRAND (Discussion Slide)\n\n**Current:** Basic discussion about brand elements\n\n**Improved Version:**\n```\nYOUR BRAND\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What defines a truly meaningful brand? What brands do you personally connect with and why?\n\nPotential answers:\n- Brands that solve real problems in my life\n- Brands that share my values about what matters\n- Brands that help me live better according to what I care about\n- Brands that are transparent and authentic\n- Brands that help me be more efficient with resources\n- Brands that respect my values and priorities\n\nFollow-up Question: How do these meaningful connections create business advantages like customer loyalty and word-of-mouth marketing?\n\nSummary: A brand is more than logo and visuals—it's a relationship based on shared values and meaningful experiences. When customers connect with your brand on a values level, they become advocates, reducing marketing costs and building resilience against market shifts.\n```\n\n### Slide 11-12: MISSION & VALUES (Discussion Slide)\n\n**Current:** Conventional mission/values discussion with some green elements\n\n**Improved Version:**\n```\nMISSION & VALUES: SOURCES OF MEANING\n\n10 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What makes work meaningful for you personally? When have you felt most fulfilled in your work?\n\nFacilitator notes:\n- Guide discussion toward meaningful experiences, not abstract concepts\n- Encourage examples of when entrepreneurs felt their work mattered\n- Connect these meaningful experiences to potential customer experiences\n\nKey Discussion Points:\n- Mission as shared purpose: What meaningful difference are you and your customers trying to make together?\n- Values as sources of meaning: What situations create meaningful experiences for you and your customers?\n- Authenticity matters: Customers can detect when values are just marketing vs. truly lived\n\nExamples:\n- Patagonia's mission isn't \"sustainability\" (an abstract word), but \"We're in business to save our home planet\" (a meaningful purpose)\n- Their values show up in repair services and \"Don't Buy This Jacket\" campaigns\n- This creates business advantages: lower marketing costs, higher customer loyalty, resilience to price competition\n```\n\n### Slides 14-15: DETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES (Activity)\n\n**Current:** Selection from a values word list\n\n**Improved Value Discovery Exercise:**\n```\nDISCOVER YOUR MEANINGFUL VALUES\n\n20 minutes: Activity\n\nIntroduction: \"Instead of selecting abstract value words, let's discover what truly creates meaning for you and your customers.\"\n\nStep 1: Meaningful Moments (5 min)\n- Write down 2-3 moments when you felt your work was truly meaningful\n- What made these moments matter to you?\n\nStep 2: Customer Meaning (5 min)\n- Based on your research, when do your customers experience meaningful moments related to your product/service?\n- What conditions or situations create meaning for them?\n\nStep 3: Business Advantages (5 min)\n- How could aligning with these sources of meaning:\n  * Reduce your marketing costs?\n  * Strengthen customer loyalty?\n  * Differentiate you from competitors?\n  * Create operational efficiencies?\n\nStep 4: Express Your Values (5 min)\n- Create value statements that express the conditions that create meaning\n- Example: \"We create opportunities for families to connect through shared outdoor experiences\" (vs. generic \"Family\" or \"Connection\")\n```\n\n### New Slide: VALUES-DRIVEN BUSINESS ADVANTAGES\n\n```\nVALUES-DRIVEN BUSINESS ADVANTAGES\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nExplain: \"When values are authentic sources of meaning, they create concrete business benefits:\"\n\n1. Lower Customer Acquisition Costs\n   - Customers who share your values become advocates\n   - Word-of-mouth reduces marketing expenses\n\n2. Operational Efficiencies\n   - Values alignment reduces waste (doing only what matters)\n   - Staff motivated by meaningful work are more productive\n\n3. Business Resilience\n   - Values-aligned customers are less price-sensitive\n   - Meaningful connections survive market disruptions\n\n4. Resource Optimization\n   - Focus on what truly creates meaning often requires fewer resources\n   - Eliminating meaningless activities reduces waste\n\nExample: Patagonia's Worn Wear program repairs old clothing instead of selling new items - seems counterintuitive, but creates stronger customer loyalty and reduces marketing costs\n```\n\n## Updated Positioning Statement Worksheet\n\nHere's an improved version of your positioning statement worksheet that integrates the values-as-meaning approach:\n\n```\n**Positioning Statement Worksheet**\n\nA positioning statement shows how your product/service creates meaningful value for your customers in a way that's different from competitors.

Ethics aren’t just rules to follow—they represent your deeper\n'why' and drive your business forward, especially in challenging times.\n\"\nDiscussion Questions (10 minutes):\nWhen someone says 'ethics,\n' what's the first thing that comes to your mind?\nHow can authenticity provide your business with unique advantages that competitors\ncan't easily replicate?\nWhat impact does alignment with a founder's deepest values have on business\nsuccess?\nCan you recall a moment when you felt genuinely alive and motivated by your work?\nHow can that kind of energy enhance business performance?\nHave you seen examples where businesses succeeded specifically because they stayed\ntrue to their core values? What happened?\nWho are the stakeholders impacted by your business (customers, employees, local\ncommunity, environment)? Why does considering their well-being contribute to your\nlong-term success?\nEncourage participants to share real examples—situations where businesses either lost\ntrust by cutting corners or built loyalty by sticking firmly to their values.\nAs the conversation progresses, highlight the two fundamental approaches to ethics:\nWrap-Up Points (2-3 minutes):\n\"We've talked about two main pathways businesses can take regarding\nethics—Compliance-based and Values-based. Let's briefly explore each:\"\nCompliance-Based Ethics: Playing Safe\nDoing what's legally required—meeting regulations and avoiding penalties.\nPrimarily focused on avoiding problems and doing no harm.\nLimitations: Laws differ by location, and simply following rules doesn't create deeper\nconnections with customers or employees.\nValues-Based Ethics: Igniting Purpose\nGoing beyond compliance because you have a meaningful purpose and clear core\nvalues.\nActing authentically, proactively, and ethically—even when nobody is\nwatching—because your 'why' genuinely drives you.\nWillingness to put in extra effort aligned with your values, making your work more\npurposeful and fulfilling.\nWhy Values Ignite Your Business:\nCustomer Connection: People support businesses whose values align with theirs.\nAuthenticity builds trust, loyalty, and lasting customer relationships.\nTeam Loyalty: Employees remain engaged and motivated when their work serves a\nmeaningful purpose beyond financial compensation.\nLong-term Resilience: Businesses guided by strong, clear values can more effectively\nadapt to challenges and thrive amid uncertainty.\nCompetitive Edge: Authenticity differentiates your business clearly and powerfully in\ncrowded markets.\nClosing Thought:\nWe aren't just building startups—we're cultivating purpose-driven businesses that attract\ncustomers, inspire communities, and stand the test of time. Ethics, grounded in\nauthenticity and values, can become your a strategic advantage.\nAs Epictetus famously said:\n\"First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to.\n\"\n3\n5 Minutes: Discussion - Ethics: Living Values That Ignite Business Continued\nDiscussion Questions (2-3 minutes):\nWhat is your strong why? What “why” will keep you going when things are hard? What\nvalues and ethical ways of doing business will inspire you, help you find aligned funders,\nteam members and customers?\n4\n3-5 minutes: Discussion:\nAsk: What do you think about this video? How do you think it was received by the\npublic?\n3 minutes: Lecture\nShare some actual figures about this video:\n$101,000 budget to make the video\n+$150,000,000 in returns\n3x more views than some Super Bowl commercials\nThis video caused the largest traffic spike to their website\nTheir story was featured all over the news and on shows like Ellen.\n5\n“Brands with a purpose grow faster”\nUNILEVER STRATEGY\n5 minutes: Lecture\nUnilever is the +$62.6 billion/yr company that owns Dove and many other international\nbrands.\nAfter researching, they discovered with bottom line evidence that “Brands with a purpose\ngrow faster” (twice as fast for some of their companies). Their internal data showed that\n15% of growth came from brands that had a purpose. Therefore, they made a strategic\ndecision to adjust their strategy to make sure that all of their brands have an activated\nbrand purpose.\n“The cost of inaction is a lot more than taking action”\n- Jonathan Atwood VP of\ncommunications and sustainable living at Unlilever.\nShort discussion: Can you think of a business you interact with because you align with\ntheir values and purpose?\n6\nMcDonalds, Green and Healthy?\n3-5 minutes: Discuss\nIs McDonald's known to be a green and healthy restaurant?\nWhy did McDonalds go “green” in Europe?\nIs this an authentic display of McDonald’s core values? Why or why not?\n7\nFROM WORDS TO PURPOSE\nInnovation\nTeamwork\nCommitment\nIntegrity\nResponsibility\nFacilitator Notes (1-2 minutes):\nOpen with challenge: \"Every business claims values like these on their website. But\nwhen do these words actually matter? What makes the difference between empty\nstatements and values that guide real decisions?\"\nQuick example: McDonald's painted arches green and added salads, claiming\nenvironmental values—but their core business remains unchanged\"\nGo To Slide 10\n8\nCompany\nClaimed Values\nActual Practices\n🚫 McDonald's\nSustainability, Health\nMinimal menu changes; superficial “green” initiatives; continues to rely heavily on\nunhealthy, highly processed foods.\n🚫 Volkswagen (Dieselgate)\nIntegrity, Responsibility\nLied about emissions software, lost public trust and environmental claims.\n✅ Patagonia\nSustainability, Responsibility\nTransparent supply chain; promotes repair over replacement; donates profits to\nenvironmental protection.\n✅ Tony’s Chocolonely\nFairness, Integrity\nActively combats slavery in chocolate industry; transparent about challenges and\nsolutions.\nFROM WORDS TO PURPOSE\nFacilitator Notes (2-3 minutes):\nDiscuss: \"Think about your stated values. What would it look like if these weren't just\nwords but the heartbeat of your business? What would your customers notice and miss if\nyou were gone tomorrow?\"\nBridge to next slide: \"Your values matter only when they guide real choices and actions.\nThings people can see, hear, share. Actions that connect with people, profit, and\nplanet—what we call the triple bottom line. That's where we're headed next.\n\"\n9\nWHO ARE YOUR STAKEHOLDERS?\nPEOPLE\nPLANET\nPROFIT\n2-3 minutes: Lecture\nAs a business, you will have an impact on so many different people just by existing. You\nhave an impact on your customers, your employees, the shareholders of your company,\nthe communities you operate in, and the planet we live on. This impact could be positive\nor negative and it all depends on the choices you make as the leader of your company.\nTherefore, you should actively think through how your business decisions will impact all\nof your different stakeholders.\nWe will look at the triple bottom line business model to do this. When you think of a\n“bottom line”\n, traditionally that means a solely profit driven business (bottom line of a\nP&L), but there are businesses who are driven for other reasons as well (people driven\ncompanies, environmentally driven companies, etc…)\nOver the next few slides, spend time in each category to brainstorm things entrepreneurs\ncan do right now or in the near future to be more ethical and ultimately, more sustainable\nin these 3 categories (representing the Triple Bottom Line model):\nPeople\nPlanet\nProfit\nTrainer tip: Over the next few slides, try to avoid answers such as “make donations” or\n“give away free products”\n. Those things are great, but try to get the entrepreneurs to\nthink about how their core of their business’ existence can be rooted in uplifting the\nworld. Donations and giveaways are great, but they aren’t sustainable on their own. We\nwill discuss “good answers” on the next slides. These things can include using less\nplastic in packaging, having a transparent and fair hiring process, etc…).\n10\nPEOPLE\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\nHave a discussion on ways to positively impact all the people who interact with your\nbusiness or are impacted by it in some way.\nWrite all the answers on the board.\nAs people share answers, try to go deeper and show how these “ethical” actions actually\nhave a positive impact on your business as well\nAsk: What are things that your business can do to have a positive impact on people?\nPotential answers:\nCommunity:\nEducational events and workshops related to your mission for community members,\ncustomers, employees, etc…\nPartnerships and collaborations with other businesses or organizations working towards\nthe same mission\nHire from your local community. Job creation stimulates growth.\nHire vulnerable or marginalized people\nTackle social issues through company policy and actions\nEmployees:\nPay employees well\nGive employees benefits\nProvide education or personal development opportunities\nEnsure fair (or good) hours and working conditions\nCustomers:\nYour business should be solving a problem for them\nYour products should be safe and not cause any harm\nListen and respect them\nExamples you can give:\nChobani Yogurt has a policy to hire refugees which positively affects society\nStarbucks has a policy to hire veterans and refugees. They also have policies to prevent\nfood waste and give food to people in need within their communities.\nTrainer tip: If entrepreneurs are having a hard time coming up with answers, consider\nasking “What are some ethical companies you know about? How do they treat their\nemployees and community? What do they do that inspires you?\n11\nPROFIT\n5 minutes: Discussion\nIn the triple bottom line model, profits are important, but not always the driving force. At\nthe end of the day, you have to remember that you have to make a profit. It is great to do\ngood, but if you can’t sustain yourself your business won’t last.\nAsk: How can you actually implement some of those ideas from before while also\nkeeping profitability in mind?\nPotential answers:\nConduct a cost benefit analysis on the ideas to see which owns are most “beneficial”\nOnly do things that you can afford to do\nFind other companies or organizations to donate to your cause and\nIntegrate ethics into your business model in a way that ethical behavior is always\nprofitable!\nEtc…\nMore information on the examples you from the “People slide”:\nChobani Yogurt has a policy to hire refugees which positively affects society (this does\nnot affect profits at all)\nStarbucks has a policy to hire veterans and refugees. They also have policies to prevent\nfood waste and give food to people in need within their communities. (these decisions\nhave actually had a positive effect on Starbucks profitability from the good publicity)\n12\nPLANET\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\nHave a discussion on ways to positively impact all the environment and planet with your\nbusiness.\nWrite all the answers on the board.\nAs people share answers, try to go deeper and show how these “ethical” actions actually\nhave a positive impact on your business as well\nAsk: What are things that your business can do to have a positive impact on the planet?\nPotential answers:\nConsider circular business models that use a different way of producing and consuming\ngoods to be more environmentally friendly and “circular” (in a way that mimics natures).\nThis can include using recycled materials in production or incentivizing customers to\nreturn products to the company where it can be refurbished or reused in another way\n(circular model). Avoid extracting things from the earth, giving it to the customers, and\nputting it in a landfill (this is a linear model).\nRecycle when you can\nReduce consumption and try to conserve natural resources\nReuse when you can instead of creating more waste\nRepair old or broken materials instead of throwing them out\nDonate excess materials/goods instead of throwing them out\nStreamline processes and remove unnecessary steps\nThink of ways to have a better impact on water & air quality,\nTrainer tip: If entrepreneurs are having a hard time coming up with answers, consider\nasking “What are some ethical companies you know about? What do they do to\npositively impact the environment? What do they do that inspires you?\n13\nLIVING YOUR VALUES, NOT JUST MARKETING THEM\nFacilitator Notes (5 minutes: Discussion)\n\"We've talked about finding values that truly matter to you and activating them through\nthe triple bottom line. But in a world where 'ethical' and 'green' have become marketing\nbuzzwords, how do businesses that genuinely live their values stand out from those just\nwearing the costume?\"\nTransition: This disconnect between what companies claim and what they do has a\nname: 'greenwashing' or 'ethics washing.\n' It happens when values become marketing\ntools rather than authentic guides for decisions.\nAsk: \"How can your business demonstrate that your values run deeper than marketing?\nHow do you build trust that your 'why' is genuine?\"\nGuide toward concrete answers:\n\"Make choices that might cost you something in the short term but align with your\nvalues\"\n\"Be transparent about both your successes and challenges\"\n\"Invite verification through certification programs relevant to your sector:\"\nISO standards for quality and environmental management\nOrganic certification for food products\nFair Trade for ethical supply chains\nB Corporation certification for overall social and environmental performance\nConnect back to meaning: The strongest businesses don't just meet standards—they set\nthem based on what truly matters to them. When values come from an authentic source\nof meaning, customers don't just see compliance—they feel your authentic purpose and\nbuilds loyalty that marketing can't buy.\nApplication: Now, thinking about your specific business and the values we've been\ndiscussing, what's one concrete action you could take this month that would\ndemonstrate your commitment isn't just talk?\n14\nFROM VALUES TO IMPACT\nMEASURE WHAT MATTERS\nACTIVATING YOUR BRAND PURPOSE:\nFacilitator Notes (5 minutes: Introduction & Set-Up)\nClearly connect this activity to the previous discussions:\nWe've talked extensively about ethics, authenticity, and avoiding greenwashing/values\nwashing. Now it’s time to put this into action. Real business ethics means aligning what\nyou say (your values) with what you actually do. Let's move beyond words and create a\nconcrete, measurable way to activate your brand purpose.\nGuiding Questions (for entrepreneurs):\nWhat problem are you genuinely solving?\nWho benefits directly from your solution (customers, employees, community)?\nBased on your authentic core values, what three meaningful impacts do you want your\nbusiness to have in the world?\nActivity Instructions (1 hour):\nClearly list your core values and your deeper \"why\" behind your business.\nIdentify at least three measurable actions your business can take that authentically\nembody these values and positively impact your stakeholders (People, Planet, Profit).\nDescribe specific ways you will measure and communicate these impacts:\nConsider customer surveys, storytelling, transparency initiatives, and formal impact\nreports.\nExplore widely recognized third-party certifications and assessments, such as:\nISO standards\nFair Trade Certification\nOrganic Certification\nLEED Certification\nRainforest Alliance\nB Corporation Certification\nTake the B Impact Assessment:\nLog in or create an account at B Impact Assessment.\nWork through the questions relevant to your business. It's okay if you don't know all the\nanswers yet—use this as a tool to identify areas where you can integrate stronger\npractices and measurements aligned with your values.\nNote: A score of 80 or above indicates passing, and it is a challenging benchmark!\nGroup Activity (15 minutes: Small Group Discussions)\nBreak into groups of 3-5.\nShare your identified impacts, strategies, and measurement ideas.\nProvide and receive feedback: Are these strategies aligned clearly with your core\nmission and values? Are they realistically achievable and measurable?\nTrainer Tip: Encourage entrepreneurs to focus deeply on practical and meaningful\nmetrics—ones that genuinely resonate with investors, customers, and stakeholders,\ndemonstrating authenticity beyond superficial marketing.\n15\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS:\nUpdate your mission statement (if necessary)\nFinish the B Impact Assessment.\nIdentify 3 areas of impact that you care about and want to measure.\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n16\nTHANK YOU\nANY QUESTIONS?\n5 minutes: Wrap up"

Once that fundamental point is clear, then you can create all that other material to help you visualize your brand.\n1\n\nSESSION OBJECTIVES:\nUnderstand how to use your brand to communicate.\n\nDefine your unique value proposition.\n\nWrite mission and vision statements for your brand. \n1 minute: Objectives\nUnderstand how to use your brand to communicate: You’ve gathered all this information, now we are going to try and define our business in a way that will resonate with your customer base.\nDefine your unique value proposition: Pinpoint the key area of your business that makes you unique.\nWrite your mission and vision statements for your business:  This is to have a clear written mission that is aligned with your brand. \n\n2\n\nBRAND CHAT\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: \"What brands do you connect with personally? What makes them meaningful to you?\"\nPotential Answers:\nSolve real problems in my life\nAlign with what matters to me\nHelp me live better according to my priorities\nFeel authentic and transparent\nUse resources efficiently in ways I respect\nFollow-Up: \"How do these meaningful connections benefit the business?\"\nPotential Answers:\nLoyal customers who spread the word\nLower marketing costs\nResilience against competition\n\nAsk: What are the different elements of a brand?

What defines a brand? What do you think of when we talk about a brand?\nPotential answers:\nCreative elements (logo, colors, marketing, etc…)\nBig companies\nConsistency\nThe name of the market or product\nThe image that comes to mind when people interact with your brand\nGood quality, (or bad quality)\nUnique\nHas creative elements (logo, name, color or font scheme, etc…)\nA company’s environmental and social commitments\n Follow-up Question: How do you see sustainability influencing customer perceptions of a brand?\nSummary: A brand is more than logo and visuals—it's a relationship based on shared values and meaningful experiences. When customers connect with your brand on a values level, they become advocates, reducing marketing costs and building resilience against market shifts.\n4\n\n“A brand is defined by a customers overall perception of your business.”\nWHAT IS THIS?\n8 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What does this apple mean? \nPotential answers:\nHigh quality\nProfessional\nHigh tech\nInternational\nIntelligence\nInnovation\nSteve Jobs\nI phone\nIOS\nExpensive\nMobile phones + other products like computers and tablets\nFun or games\nSneaky or annoying sometimes \nMoney driven company\nSecurity\nTrustworthy\n\nSummary: I showed you a picture of an apple, and so much came to your mind. You mentioned the products that Apple has, their founder, that they are expensive, you all have stories about this brand and feeling around it. I can show this picture to people all around the world, and there will probably be a similar response. That is a strong brand! \n\nAsk: Why is having a strong brand so important?\nPotential answers:\nIt is the identity of your business\nIt is how you will be remembered\nYou want a good brand identity, not a bad one!\nMaintaining a positive brand image is important because it will have a lasting impression on customers! They don’t forget easily and they have power!\nYou can sell a brand, not only a product\nThe strategy and actions of a business could be good or bad. These actions will define your brand and will make an impact over the next several years.\n\nRecap: Having a brand is really important for a business. It helps customers differentiate you from the competitors and remember you for what you are good at. What do we want our customers to think about when they interact with our products?\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A BRAND?\nQuality\nProducts and services\nCreative elements\nMessage\nA brand is consistent in its:\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: What is a brand\nLet people answer freely, then cover these points below as well: \nQuality: iPhones are great quality. We know this because it is consistently true. I would never buy an iPhone and question the quality of it. It is the same in every box in every country (unless it is a fake product). \nProducts and services: Apple is consistent in their products and services as well. They are a technology company. I know that they won’t be coming out with furniture or kitchenware. That would make for a very confusing brand. When creating a brand, make sure you are consistent in the things you offer as well.\nCreative elements: Commercials, marketing materials, office layout, website, Facebook, and more! Everything is in line with the same creative elements. There is a consistency with color and font schemes. Logos use and all creative elements are consistent. \nYou saw the Apple logo and knew what it was immediately. If someone took another icon of a fruit with a bite in it, many of us will think of Apple. That is a strong brand! \nMessage: Your message is consistent across all channels, internally, and externally. Whether it is your commercials, the writing on your packaging, blogs that you write, your company culture, or anything else, your message is clear and consistent. What is the problem you are solving? What does your business do? Make sure those things are clear.\n\nRecap: Apply your branding across your business and evolve it as you grow. As you grow and expand, you want to make it as easy as possible for people to know exactly what you do. If you do too much, or aren’t consistent in these points, you make it hard for people to recognize you out of the crowd.\n\n5 minutes: Brief activity\nFor each of the logos, discuss if they have a good brand or not. Try to touch on all of the four points mentioned on the slide.\n\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION\n10 minutes: Discussion + Exercise\n\nA value proposition is a promise of meaningful value that your business delivers better than alternatives. It answers: \"Why should people choose you?\"\n\nAsk: \"How do your authentic values create a unique advantage in the market?\"\nGuide discussion to explore:\n\n1. Intersection of Meaning\n   - What meaningful experiences do your customers seek?\n   - How do your authentic values help create those experiences?\n   - What meaningful difference does your solution make compared to alternatives?\n\n2. Business Advantages\n   - Does your values-aligned approach create efficiency advantages?\n   - Can your authentic values reduce costs or risks in ways competitors can't?\n   - Do shared values with customers create stronger loyalty and reduce marketing costs?\n\nExercise:\nComplete this sentence: \"Unlike our competitors, we _____________ because we genuinely value _____________.\"\n\nExamples to share:\n- Patagonia: \"Unlike typical outdoor brands, we help you keep using what you already own because we genuinely value reducing environmental impact.\"\n- Warby Parker: \"Unlike traditional eyewear companies, we make prescription glasses accessible to more people because we genuinely value equal access to vision care.\"\n\n\u000bOriginal [[[5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat is a unique value proposition?\nPotential answers could be:\nSomething that makes you unique\nA clear statement to describe what you do\nThe key offerings of your business\nIt is the point that differentiates you from your competitors\nShows why your product is better than other in the market\n]]]\n7\n\n“A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you”\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nState the definition of a value proposition and connect it to their ideas from before.\nAsk: \n How can we actually get to our unique value proposition? Does anyone have an idea? (What makes you stand out—whether it’s pricing, durability, or an extra benefit like helping customers save resources?) The answers here will frame the next slides.\nPotential answers:\nWe get it from our research\nUsers have to tell us\nWe have to look at what is already in the market\nLook at competitors to see what they are offering and what they are good at\nWe look at our business idea and what we are good at\nWe consider whether sustainability can be a unique differentiator (e.g., eco-friendly materials, ethical supply chains, low-carbon operations, waste reduction).\n \n Discussion Prompt: Could sustainability be a part of your Unique Value Proposition? If yes, how?\n\nRecap: Over the past month, you guys have been doing a ton of research. You have done a deep dive into the market to try to identify gaps and areas of opportunity. You now know 3 important factors needed to define our UVP:\nWhat you and your business are good at\nWhat the market wants and needs\nWhat competitors are offering\n Additional Consideration: Some businesses differentiate themselves by being the \"green alternative.\" Think about how sustainability could enhance your value proposition.\n\nYour business \nand what you \ndo well\nThe market \nand customers needs \n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo first there is you. You all came in here with business ideas and you want to see if there is a market for it. You have certain:\nCapabilities\nInterests\nInformation\nA business idea \nSkills\nExperience\n\nBut you also have the market. The market has:\nPeople with changing needs, wants, desires, frustrations, etc…\nThe market can be big or small\nYour market is where you can actually reach, so it can be limited geographically\nEtc…\n\nWhat we are searching for this month, is to see if people want your idea. Based on your capabilities of developing and delivering a product, will people want what you have? And the next question, is there enough people who want it? \nThrough the animation of the circles, show:\nThe more overlap between your business idea and the needs of the market means that there is more potential for your business to succeed. \nWhen there is a small overlap (a small number of people in the market interested in your idea), there is a smaller market potential. This could be considered a niche market.\nMake sure the size of the market is worth your time and energy! Ask yourself, “is this enough for me? Will I be satisfied from the returns of this market?”\n\nYour business \nand what you\ndo well\nThe market \nand customers\nneeds\nCompetitors\nUNIQUE \nVALUE PROPOSITION\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBut there is one more thing. The market also has something else, competitors! They:\nSell other things similar to yours\nServing your customers needs now!\nDon’t serve the needs of the whole market \nYou won’t ever have the whole market\n\nBecause not everyone's needs are being met. There is an opportunity to meet those customers needs and differentiate yourself from your competitors. \n\nAsk: Based on this visual, where should you focus your energy?\nOverlap between competitors and you: Don’t go here! The market doesn’t show any desire for these things! Don’t waste your energy or time.\nOverlap between competitors and market: You could try to go here, but it could be dangerous. You are competing with your competitors on something they are really good at, and you are not good at. You might be seen as a less desirable option to your customers. Or it will take some time to be a strong competitor.\nOverlap between the three circles: This is somehow the bare minimum. Customers want it, competitors do it, and you have the capabilities for it. You should probably be doing this too. \nOverlap between you and the market: This is where you will find your unique value proposition. Customers want it, but the competitors aren’t offering it! Here is where you can really add value and differentiate yourself from your competitors.\n\nWhy choose you?\n\nWHERE DO YOU CREATE UNIQUE VALUE?\nCheaper price?\nFaster service?\nHigher quality?\n10 minutes: Discussion + Activity\n\nAsk: Keeping what we just talked about in mind, what are your value propositions? What is the promise of value you will deliver to your customers? The primary reason customers buy from you instead of your competitor?\nTake some time to think about the UVP, then have everyone share their answers.\nTrainer note: Make sure they are not just explaining their product, listing features, or creating a slogan.\n\nOther examples you can bring up if needed:\nNike offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, customization, and brand/status (https://www.cleverism.com/company/nike/).\nThe value proposition of MailChimp that they offer is simple, direct, and bold.\nApple's Iphone value proposition offers a unique experience\nUber's value proposition, offers uber convenience (https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples)\n11\n\nPOSITIONING STATEMENT TEMPLATE:\n(Target Personas)\n(Product Name)\n(Category)\n(Key Customer Benefit)\n(Nearest Competitive Alternatives)\nIs the one\nthat\nunlike\nTO\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation of Positioning statement and difference from UVP\nYour Positioning statement is a way to take your UVP and engage your customers. You are speaking to them in this statement. \nThe UVP and positioning statements are rooted in a clear understanding of your customers and what drives them emotionally\nA UVP shows what differentiates your product from your competitors’ products/services and makes it special.\nYour positioning statement captures the space you want to own in your customer’s mind, based on the unique value that you can offer.\nIf sustainability is a part of your business model, your positioning statement can reflect that.\n Trainer Notes:\n Encourage participants to think about whether sustainability could be a key differentiator in their positioning.\n Sustainability-driven positioning can help businesses attract customers who prioritize eco-friendly products and responsible brands.\n\n\nTO environmentally conscious travelers, \u000b(EcoJourney App) is the travel platform that \u000boffers authentic local experiences while also protecting the environment unlike \u000bstandard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: TO environmentally conscious travelers, \n(EcoJourney App) is the travel platform that \noffers authentic local experiences while also protecting the environment unlike \nstandard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism.\n\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\n\n13\n\nTO all global travelers, (Tourism App) is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: To all global travelers, Tourism App is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\nTO, **(EcoJourney App)** is the one travel planning platform that connects you with authentic local experiences while minimizing environmental impact, unlike standard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism regardless of its effects. \n14\n\nMISSION & VALUES\nMISSION & VALUES: WHAT TRULY MATTERS\n\n10 minutes: Guided Reflection & Discussion\n\nAsk: \"Think about a time when your work felt deeply meaningful to you - when you felt like what you were doing really mattered. What was happening in that moment?\"\n\nFacilitate sharing of these moments, noting common themes on the board.\n\nFollow-up: \"What made these experiences meaningful? What conditions or situations created that sense of purpose?\"\n\nConnect to Mission & Values:\n- Mission is not about grand statements, but about creating the conditions for meaningful experiences\n- Values are not abstract words, but the lived priorities that show up in your meaningful moments\n- When your business creates these same meaningful conditions for customers, employees and communities, you build authentic connection\n\nExamples to share:\n- Patagonia's mission \"We're in business to save our home planet\" emerged from the founder's meaningful experiences in nature\n- Their repair program came from valuing durability and reducing waste, not from selecting \"sustainability\" from a word list\n\nAsk: \"How might creating these meaningful conditions for others also create business advantages?\"\nPotential answers:\n- Customers who share these values become loyal advocates\n- Employees find deeper motivation beyond paychecks\n- Decision-making becomes clearer and more consistent\n- Resource efficiency happens naturally when you focus on what truly matters\n\nOriginal: [[[\u000b10 minutes: Discussion\n\nMission, vision, and values\nSo, what are mission, vision, and value statements? What is the difference between them? \nWrite out their thoughts on the board separating mission and values\nMission statement: A Mission statement describes why the organization exists and why it does what it does.\nUsually is bigger than the organization itself\nMany times mission is “unrealistic”\nCan also reflect environmental and social commitments (e.g., Patagonia’s mission: “We’re in business to save our home planet”).\n\nValue statement: A value statement describes and lists the fundamental values and principles that the organization operates by.\nCompany focused\nWhere you hope to see the business down the line\nProduct related\nCan highlight sustainability commitments (e.g., responsible sourcing, reducing waste, ethical labor practices).\n\nEntrepreneurs might bring up vision statements as well. A vision statement describes the ideal future state of the organization.  It articulates what the organization is trying to accomplish.\n\nAsk: Why is it important to have clearly defined mission, vision, and value statements? (Customers care about consistency, trust, and whether a business is ethical, efficient, or innovative.)\nHave a discussion and write down all the thoughts on the board.\nPotential answers:\nStay focused on what is really important,\nBusinesses should be able to clearly talk about what they are trying to achieve (on a grander scale),\nThey should have a statement to show why they exist,\nHaving a clear statement provides direction for employees and management, \nKeeps businesses accountable for their environmental and social impact.\nHelps brands build long-term customer loyalty by aligning with sustainability values.\nKeeps your business customer/solution oriented instead of just focusing on profits,\nCommunicate the company’s beliefs to employees, customers, partners, and the general public,\nEstablish an identity, start a corporate culture,\nAttract like-minded employees,\nAid in the decision-making process (use the mission to reflect on the companies greater goals),\nKeeps you thinking about the future (great leaders/organizations always are)!\n]]]\n15\n\n“We create happiness by providing the finest in entertainment for people of all ages, everywhere”\n“To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful”\n“Simplify life for people around the world”\nMISSION STATEMENTS:\n“We are synergizing green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues.”\n20 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\n8 minutes: Mission statements\nAsk: Take a look at these famous company mission statements. What do you see among all of them? \nPotential answers:\nMany people might reiterate some points from before\nNone of these missions state the products/services they sell\nIt is the end goal for the customers\nThey fulfill their “why”, their purpose, through their products and services\n\n10-15 minutes: Activity\nWrite your mission! So, what is it that you want to accomplish? Don’t think about money, don’t think about sustainable answers, or anything else. If you could see a change in the world that is meaningful for you, what would that look like?\nHave a few people read out their missions if they want to\n\nOther examples of mission statements:\nAmazon's mission hints at its world-ruling ambitions: \"It's our goal to be Earth's most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything online.“\nFacebook's mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.“\nUber has a simple, bold, mission: \"Transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone.“\nTwitter's mission is \"To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.“\nDropbox’s mission is to “simplify life for people around the world.\"\nKESK’s mission is to: “Synergize green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues”\n\nKESK Mission Reference: https://www.keskco.com/about\n16\n\nDETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\nInnovation\nTeamwork\nCommitment\n15 minutes: Activity\n\nActivity: What do you value?\nGive out the list of verbs\nEach entrepreneur should take about 5 minutes to choose all of the verbs that represent their business,\nGo around the room and ask how many people have circled\nSome people will have few values chosen which shows that they might have a clear picture and a focus already\nSome people might have chosen almost all of them. In this case, point out that it is great to have so many values; however, it is hard for one business to represent them all.\nGive the entrepreneurs 3 more minutes to choose only five.\n 5 minutes: Add a verb to each\nExamples: Live adventurously, create curiosity, build independence, etc…\n\nMultiply, promote, act, find, search for, establish, think, listen, laugh, hold, encourage, have, be, practice, unite, \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nShould I pick my values or company values? As the founder of your company, your values should be intertwined with your company values to a degree. The leadership of your company should embody the mission and values your company projects to the world. \nCan this change? Yes it can change; however, try to think of long lasting values that will help shape your company and its culture. These values should last far into the future. If these values are not in line with your customers and their needs, you might face problems. \n17\n\nDETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\nIntegrity\nResponsibility\nSustainability\nWe need to replace this - takes too long and is too abstract and will be hard for young first time entrepreneurs : [[[20 minutes: Facilitated Activity\n\nIntroduction: \"Instead of selecting values from a list, we'll discover them in your most meaningful experiences.\"\n\nStep 1: Meaningful Moments (5 min - Individual)\n- Write down 2-3 specific moments when your work felt most meaningful\n- What was happening? Who was involved? What made it matter?\n\nStep 2: Identify Underlying Values (5 min - Individual)\n- For each meaningful moment, ask: \"What made this situation important to me?\"\n- What conditions or qualities were present that created meaning?\n- What would someone watching notice you cared about?\n\nStep 3: Connect to Customer Experience (5 min - Individual)\n- How might your customers experience similar meaningful moments through your business?\n- What conditions can your business create that would matter to them in similar ways?\n\nStep 4: Small Group Sharing (5 min)\n- Share your meaningful moments and the values you discovered\n- Help each other identify authentic values you might have missed\n- Discuss how these values could shape business decisions\n\nFacilitator Notes:\n- Authentic values come from lived experience, not abstract words\n- The same meaning-creating conditions that matter to you will likely matter to others\n- These authentic values will inform both your mission and your unique value proposition\n- Values aren't just what you say, but how you make decisions when trade-offs arise\n]]]\n18\n\nCreating a culture of warmth and belonging, where everyone is welcome.\nActing with courage, challenging the status quo.\nBeing present, connecting with transparency, dignity and respect.\nWe are performance driven, through the lens of humanity.\n\n“To inspire and nurture the human spiritone person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time ”\nSTARBUCKS\n10 minutes: Discussion\n\nStarbucks example:\nLet’s take a look at Starbucks mission and value statements. \nHow do they live by these statements?\nIs this something that is just written in their documents, or do they live by this?\n19\n\nRefine your brand positioning statement based on your unique value proposition. \nRefine your mission and vision statements for your brand.\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n20\n\nTHANK YOU!\nAny Questions?\n21\n"

Let's discover the principles that guide your unique approach.\"\n\n3-Question Exercise (10 min - Individual):\n\n1. What frustrated you about how others have tried to solve the problem your business addresses?\n   (Example: \"Existing delivery services waste too much packaging\" or \"Financial advice is too complicated for regular people\")\n\n2. How does your approach solve this problem differently?\n   (Example: \"We use minimal, reusable packaging\" or \"We explain finances in plain language\")\n\n3. Why is this approach important to you personally?\n   (Example: \"I grew up seeing wasteful practices\" or \"My family struggled with confusing financial decisions\")\n\nQuick Sharing (5 min):\n- Share your answers with a partner\n- Help identify the underlying values revealed in your approach\n- Consider how these values create business advantages (efficiency, loyalty, differentiation)\n\nFacilitator Notes:\n- Values should be evident in how you solve problems, not just abstract words\n- Real values drive practical business decisions about resources, processes, and priorities\n- The most powerful values connect to both personal meaning AND customer benefit\n- Encourage participants to think about how their values influence their operational choices\n```\n\n## Core Changes to Approach\n\n1. **Connect meaning to problem-solving** - Frame values as how you uniquely approach solving customer problems, making them practical and business-focused\n\n2. **Make it action-oriented** - Focus on concrete decisions and methods rather than abstract reflection\n\n3. **Emphasize competitive advantage** - Show how values-aligned problem-solving creates tangible business benefits through differentiation and customer connection\n\n4. **Simplify the exercise** - Use a focused 3-question approach that can be completed in the time available while still getting to authentic values\n\n5. **Bridge utility and meaning** - Acknowledge that meaningful business experiences typically involve solving real problems, but in ways that align with deeper values\n\nThis approach maintains the core goal of discovering authentic values while making the process more concrete, practical, and directly connected to business outcomes. It should feel less \"fluffy\" while still getting to the important underlying principles that will guide their business decisions.",

What frustrated you about how others have tried to solve the problem your business addresses?\n   (Example: \"Existing delivery services waste too much packaging\" or \"Financial advice is too complicated for regular people\")\n\n2. How does your approach solve this problem differently?\n   (Example: \"We use minimal, reusable packaging\" or \"We explain finances in plain language\")\n\n3. Why is this approach important to you personally?\n   (Example: \"I grew up seeing wasteful practices\" or \"My family struggled with confusing financial decisions\")\n\nQuick Sharing (5 min):\n- Share your answers with a partner\n- Help identify the underlying values revealed in your approach\n- Consider how these values create business advantages (efficiency, loyalty, differentiation)\n\nFacilitator Notes:\n- Values should be evident in how you solve problems, not just abstract words\n- Real values drive practical business decisions about resources, processes, and priorities\n- The most powerful values connect to both personal meaning AND customer benefit\n- Encourage participants to think about how their values influence their operational choices\n```\n\n## Core Changes to Approach\n\n1. **Connect meaning to problem-solving** - Frame values as how you uniquely approach solving customer problems, making them practical and business-focused\n\n2. **Make it action-oriented** - Focus on concrete decisions and methods rather than abstract reflection\n\n3. **Emphasize competitive advantage** - Show how values-aligned problem-solving creates tangible business benefits through differentiation and customer connection\n\n4. **Simplify the exercise** - Use a focused 3-question approach that can be completed in the time available while still getting to authentic values\n\n5. **Bridge utility and meaning** - Acknowledge that meaningful business experiences typically involve solving real problems, but in ways that align with deeper values\n\nThis approach maintains the core goal of discovering authentic values while making the process more concrete, practical, and directly connected to business outcomes. It should feel less \"fluffy\" while still getting to the important underlying principles that will guide their business decisions.",
