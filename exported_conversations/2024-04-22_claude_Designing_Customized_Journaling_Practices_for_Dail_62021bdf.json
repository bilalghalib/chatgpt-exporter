            "extracted_content": "Build Your Ideal Journal\n& Become a Daily Journaler\nIntroduction: \nYour activity is to design and establish your ideal journaling practice. We will create your customized, idealized, amazing journaling method to help you see and build a beautiful personal and work life. \nTo do this, we will identify your needs and intentions(your why), then pick questions for your daily journal based on this video. In this video, Cam introduces the VOMIT system, derived from 15 years of experimenting with various journaling methods. He has found five fundamental reasons for Journaling across many methods and compiles a list of journaling prompts we can steal use.\nReasons for Journaling (VOMIT):\nV - Vent: Vent to release, find clarity, and get into the writing flow. “Start with what makes you mad” - because that’s usually the easiest thing to write as it has energy behind it, bonus: it takes the chaos in the mind and puts it down in writing where you can see it to do something about them.\nPrompt: “What is alive in you right now” “What makes you mad?”\nO - Obligations: Writing down obligations to mind-dumping all your activities and responsibilities that occupy your mind. Writing them down helps free up mental space for solving problems instead of just storing them. \nSuggested 4-step method: \nObligation dump\nCluster into buckets\nPrioritize,\nMake a to-do list\nPick the absolute minimum that needs to be done and forget the rest for today.\nTo help prioritize you can ask a guiding question, try this one: \n\nWhat one thing on this list would make everything else easier or unnecessary? \nM - Mindset: Mindset is often shared as the key to success, yet practical methods to develop mindsets, and which mindsets to develop are often left vague. In my research into how people grow when catastrophic changes happen, I found the following two mindsets to be critical: \n1) A secure and empowered mindset that supports the development of communal relationships of trust and sharing. \n2) a mindset of “deliberate rumination” - where the first thing that comes to your mind when disaster strikes is “How could this possibly be something good” or if that’s not possible “What opportunities are now available given this terrible situation.” It’s important to note that this is not a “positivity” mindset, it’s a realistic mindset empowered to find new opportunities, build relationships, and walk the narrow path of opportunity that is always present for those seeking them.\n\nCam suggests you can train and improve your mindset through various prompting techniques:\nReframing Find a new way to see your situation, and build a mindset that you value. Perhaps you can identify how others respond to similar situations and you can ask yourself, how would they respond, what would they ask themselves?\nReframing prompt “How is this the best thing that has ever happened to me?”\nPossibility \nFind possibility with because of statements. Affirmations are lame, to build confidence in yourself your affirmations must come with evidence, so state your affirmation+because. The because can be the tiny first step to why the affirmation is already true.\nPossibility Prompt: “I am a …” Ex: “I am a great writer… because I am practicing writing right now!” It helps you create evidence.\nInversion \nAsk the opposite to see what you want, take your goal and invert it so you see what you want.\nInversion Prompt: The opposite of what I want is… Ex: “I want to be ungrateful and be certain my friends know I don’t notice or appreciate their support.”\nPerspective: \nOthers can see us better than we can. Gain perspective by pretending to give yourself advice as your friend.\nPerspective Prompt: As your friend, I notice that… \nDiscipline: \nFind a way to stick to your journaling practice. Discipline is often connected to identity. I must tell you, after reading all this, you are a Daily Journaler. \nGratitude: \nGratitude is one of the most researched journaling prompts demonstrating many positive health and mental outcomes. \nGratitude prompt: three things you’re grateful for today, you can pick one everyday thing, one thing you helped make happen, and something that happened by chance. \n\n\nI - Ideate: It’s a tool for ideation, helping to generate ideas by using techniques like setting time-bound challenges, asking how others would solve a problem, and posing open-ended questions to stimulate the brain.\n\nA simple method for ideation is to set a timer for 5 minutes and write as many ideas around a theme that is important for you that day. It’s related to free writing, so don’t slow down or stop even if the ideas are silly!\nIdeation Prompt 1: 10 Ideas to [solve my problem, make my child smile, grow my business 10x…] (remember the quality of the ideation is related to the quality of the question).\nIdeation prompt 2: “How would [Steve Jobs, my dad, a carpenter, etc] solve this problem?\nIdeation prompt 3: If you’re journaling before night a good prompt might be to open a question so your mind works on it as you sleep. Ex: “The most important question for me today is: ….”\nT - Trajectory: Journaling helps track and tweak personal and professional trajectories by reflecting on whether current actions align with long-term goals and assessing visible and hidden life satisfaction metrics.\nTrajectory Direction Prompt:\n\nIdentify your goal and place it on the top of the page, find evidence of things you’ve been doing that day/week/month that pull you towards your goal, or push you away from achieving it. Then identify ways to add to your todo list more of what takes you towards your goal, and find ways to mitigate the things that push you away from your goal. \n \n\nTrajectory Hidden Measures Prompt: Pull out the hidden, yet essential, measures like happiness with this prompt:\nWhat excited me today?\nWhat drained me of energy today?\nWhat did I learn?\nIf you do this “trajectory” journaling method for long enough you’ll quickly see how you need to adjust your life. \n“Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” ― Howard Thurman\nMy Ideal Journal Method:\nStart with why. “alwhys - ahm- always. To do this identify your intentions then find which element of the VOMIT system they fit into and design the questions you want to answer. Remember the goal is to start a daily journaling habit, so keep it short so you can do it in under 20 mins.\n[TEMPLATE Name]’s Journaling practice Intentions \nBecome more grateful and connected with my friends and family.\nRemove clutter from my mind. \nHonor the ideas that I am blessed with by giving them a good home and acting on them at the right time.\nTo slow down and do the right things instead of many things.\n\nFor example, the author of this exercise would write:\nVent: What feelings were present the most in the last 24 hours, what could they be telling you?\nObligations: What do you need to do? What is three things from that list you can do today?\nMindset: “What are 3 things I’m grateful for?”\nIdeation: What are 10 ways I can simplify, reduce, or remove items from my obligation list?\nTrajectory: At the end of the day I will answer:\nWhat excited me today?\nWhat drained me of energy today?\nWhat did I learn?\n\nNow that you have your idealized journaling method, buy yourself a nice notebook and pen and start a timer for 20 mins. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. Do your first round right now, remember… you are a Daily Journaler.\n"

They are very competent and can take on any role you ask them to, you should have them take on different hats from De Bono's six thinking hats\n\n*   The **red hat** is for emotions.\n    \n*   The **black hat** is for criticism.\n    \n*   The **yellow hat** is for positive feedback and developing solutions.\n    \n*   The **green hat** is for new, creative ideas.)\n    \n*   Doin this you will work with them back and forth over the course of a few rounds to co-create an activity derived from this video transcript attached into an activity similar to the JournalingActivity.txt - remember to compare the transcript and the activity. Once you have a plan summarize it and and explain your reasoning and ask me 5 questions before proceeding to be sure you create a high quality output that meets my high standards and expectations for authenticity and quality content",

            "extracted_content": "Flow is often described as a state\nof kind of 'effortless effort.'\nWe feel like we're propelled through the activity.\nEverything else just seems to disappear.\nTime is gonna dilate, which is a fancy of saying\nit's gonna pass strangely.\nFive hours go by in like five minutes.\nOccasionally, it'll slow down,\nyou get a freeze-frame effect,\nI mean, anybody who's been in a car crash for example.\nIntuition tends to get turned up a lot.\nThis is a basketball player in the zone,\nseeing the hoop and suddenly it's as big as a hula hoop.\nAnd our frown muscles tend to be paralyzed.\nAnd what that frowning is,\nis a sign that the brain is doing work.\nThis is a constant issue in my marriage\nwhere my wife thinks I'm mad\nat her or somebody and I'm like,\n\"No, no, I'm just thinking.\nThis is just me thinking.\nI'm in robot mode.\"\nMy name is Steven Kotler.\nI'm a writer and a researcher, and my latest book\nis \"The Art of Impossible.\"\nFlow itself, actually,\nthe term is coined by Goethe,\nwho uses the German word \"rausch,\"\nwhich means overflowing with joy.\nNietzsche actually wrote about flow.\nWilliam James worked on the topic,\nbut Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is often referred to\nas the Godfather of Flow Psychology.\nHe was very interested in sort of well-being,\nmeaning of life, and he went around the world\ntalking to people about the times in their lives\nwhen they felt their best,\nand they performed their best.\nEverywhere he went, people said the same thing.\n\"I'm in this altered state of consciousness\nwhere every action, every decision I make,\nseems to flow effortlessly, perfectly, seamlessly\nfrom the last.\"\nFlow actually feels 'flowy.'\nMore specifically, it refers to any of those moments\nof rapt attention and total absorption.\nYou're so focused on the task at hand,\nso focused on what you're doing,\neverything else just seems to disappear.\nBut one of the things that athletes talk about a lot is\nwhat they call \"the voice.\"\nOften, when I'm skiing in flow, I will get directions-\nright, left, do this, do that,\nand it's very quick.\nYou either do what the voice is telling you to do\nor you tend to crash.\nThe challenge-skills balance is often called\nthe \"golden rule to flow.\"\nAnd the idea here is pretty simple.\nWe pay the most attention to the task at hand\nwhen the challenge of that task\nslightly exceeds our skillset.\nSo, to do this work and to get good at it,\nyou have to get good\nat being comfortable with being uncomfortable.\nYou wanna stretch but not snap.\nSo there are a number of different things you can do\nto sort of prepare yourself and prepare the environment\nto drop into flow.\nThe flow triggers are your toolkit.\n22 of them have been discovered.\nThere are probably way, way more, but so far,\nresearchers have identified 22.\nThe most basic of flow triggers-\ncomplete concentration.\nYou really wanna sorta start your work session if you can\nin relationship to your physiology.\nI like to wake up at 3:30, four o'clock in the morning.\nThat's when I'm most awake, most alert.\nI am married to a night owl.\nMy wife doesn't wake up 'til five, six, seven o'clock,\neight o'clock at night.\nThat's when her brain comes alive.\nAnd then you wanna try to block out 90 to 120 minutes\nfor uninterrupted concentration.\nPractice distraction management ahead of time.\nSo you wanna turn off your phones, turn off email,\nTwitter, Facebook, Instagram, et cetera,\nall your messages, all your alerts.\nThere was a study where they found\nthat coders in flow, if they get knocked out by distraction,\na knock at the door, a text alert, or whatever,\nit can take 'em 15 minutes to get back into flow\nif they can get back in at all.\nFlow only shows up when all of our attention\nis in the right gear, right now.\nOne way to kind of explore flow triggers,\nthere's a cluster of them\nthat are predominantly dopamine triggers.\nThey drive focus, they drive attention,\nthey drive alertness and excitement,\nand there's a lot of different ways to get dopamine.\nNovelty produces dopamine.\nWe see the same thing with unpredictability,\ncomplexity, the experience of awe.\nYou look up at the night sky and you see stars everywhere\nand you know those stars are actually universes,\nand you get sorta perceptual vastness.\nIf you've ever done a crossword puzzle or sudoku,\nyou get an answer right,\nthat little rush of pleasure you get, that's dopamine.\nAnd then you usually get a couple of answers right in a row,\nthat's because the dopamine that is now in your system\nis amplifying pattern recognition.\nWe get that same dopamine from risk-taking.\nAnd this could be physical risks,\nemotional risks, social risks, intellectual risks,\npossibly spiritual risks.\nWe get the dopamine not as a reward for taking the risk,\nwhich is what some people used to believe,\nbut now we know it's to kind of drive motivation.\nNow, there are lots of different intrinsic motivators,\nbut from a motivation standpoint,\nthere are five and they're all designed\nto be built into one another\nand work in a sort of specific order,\nin a specific sequence.\nThe most basic human motivator is curiosity.\nOne of the things we get from curiosity is focus for free.\nWhen we're curious about something,\nwe don't have to struggle.\nWe don't have to burn a lot of calories\ntrying to pay attention to it.\nCuriosity is designed, biologically again,\nto be built into passion.\nAnd think about, we've all fallen in love,\nhow much attention you pay to the person\nyou're falling in love with.\nYou can't stop thinking about them,\ncan't stop staring at them.\nThat's a tremendous amount of focus for free.\nNow, passion is incredibly useful,\nbut as a motivator, you can go one better,\nwhich is purpose.\nEveryone's talking about, \"Oh, I have a purpose,\"\nand it's this big altruistic thing\nand it's good for the world,\nand all those things may be true,\nbut from a peak performance perspective,\nit's very, very selfish.\nOnce you have purpose,\nthe system demands autonomy.\nI want the freedom to pursue my purpose.\nAnd once you have that freedom,\nthe system wants the last of the big motivators, mastery.\nMastery is the skills to pursue that purpose well.\nOne of the really incredible things about being human\nis we're all built for peak performance.\nFlow is universal in humans.\nIt's actually universal in most mammals\nand definitely all social mammals.\nThere's a shared collective version of a flow state,\na team performing at their best,\na group performing at their best.\nThis is called 'group flow.'\nIn fact, studies have shown\nthat the people who score off the charts\nfor these characteristics,\nwho score off the charts for overall well-being\nand life satisfaction,\nare the people with the most flow in their lives.\nWe're all capable of so much more than we know.\nThat is a commonality across the board.\nIt's the largest lesson in 30 years\nof studying peak performance has taught me.\nAnd the way I sorta like to think about it,\nis motivation is what gets us into the game.\nLearning allows us to continue to play.\nCreativity is how we steer.\nAnd flow, which is optimal performance,\nis how we amplify all the results\nbeyond all reasonable expectation."

Learning Designer (White Hat): Analyzes the transcript and identifies key learning objectives and takeaways.\n2. Learning Designer (Green Hat): Proposes an initial activity outline based on the learning objectives.\n3. Entrepreneur Mentor (Red Hat): Reviews the outline and provides feedback based on their experience, focusing on practicality and relevance.\n4. Positive Psychologist (Yellow Hat): Examines the refined outline and recommends evidence-based techniques to integrate into the activity.\n5. UX Designer (Blue Hat): Reviews the activity outline and proposes design elements to enhance user engagement and facilitate a seamless learning experience.\n6. Learning Designer (Green Hat): Incorporates feedback, techniques, and design elements into the final activity structure.\n7. Entrepreneur Mentor (Black Hat): Reviews the final structure and provides suggestions for collaboration, peer support, and ongoing progress tracking.\n8. Participant (Red Hat): Tests the activity and provides feedback on their experience, focusing on engagement, relevance, and usability.\n\nApproach 2: Parallel Collaboration\n1. Learning Designer (White Hat) and Entrepreneur Mentor (Red Hat) work together to analyze the transcript, identify learning objectives, and propose an initial activity outline.\n2. Positive Psychologist (Yellow Hat) and UX Designer (Green Hat) collaborate to examine the outline, recommend evidence-based techniques, and propose design elements to enhance user engagement.\n3.

Are there any specific tools or platforms that the social entrepreneurs in your program prefer for accessing learning materials and providing feedback, considering their busy schedules and tendency to use Android phones?\n4. How can we optimize the activity for entrepreneurs who spend a significant amount of time in cars, such as by creating audio-based or hands-free components?\n5. Are there any cultural considerations or language preferences we should keep in mind when designing the activity, given that many of the entrepreneurs are based in Beirut, Lebanon, or other big cities?\n\nQuestions for me to consider:\n1.

            "extracted_content": "Introduction - How to Learn What You Don’t Know Without A Teacher\nLearning how to learn is the fundamental skill of learning. It implies we must know about ourselves, our abilities, and our limits and understand the knowledge landscape. Librarians, it’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they don't know how they work. To use LLMs effectively, you must comprehend traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n \nSince last December, we've built this intuition after hundreds of hours of GPT use. Now, we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results. This is how you learn prompting.\n\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse), and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions.\n \nINSPIRE Pedagogical View\nFramework Element\nDescription\nImpact Measurement\nPotential Assessment\nTheorist\nObservable Evidence\nInquiry-Based Learning\nLearners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\nDepth and complexity of inquiry by learners.\nInquiry Skills Rating Scale.\nJohn Dewey\nQuality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, and data analysis.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning\nEmphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\nThe connection between personal experiences and learning objectives.\nReflective Writing Scale.\nDonald Schön\nDepth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing entries.\nSelf-Directed Learning\nLearners set and pursue their own learning goals.\nProgress towards self-set learning goals.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\nMalcolm Knowles\nLearners' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\nProblem-Based Learning\nLearning through addressing real-world problems.\nProblem-solving skills and application of knowledge.\nProblem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\nHoward Barrows\nProcesses and critical analysis in problem-solving.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nLearning through interaction and collaboration.\nCollaborative skills and interaction quality.\nCollaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\nLev Vygotsky\nTeam dynamics, contributions, and communication in group settings.\nResilience & Grit\nDeveloping persistence and resilience.\nPerseverance in learning challenges.\nGrit Scale.\nAngela Duckworth\nPersistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\nExperiential Learning\nHands-on activities and experiential learning.\nApplication of theoretical knowledge in practice.\nExperiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\nDavid Kolb\nStages of experiential learning: experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nConfidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\nConfidence in managing entrepreneurial challenges.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\nAlbert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\nSuccess in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\n\n\n \nS.C.R.I.B.E.R For Adults\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think for Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and teach yourself the things you don’t even know. By using this tool well, you can benefit yourself, your communities, and the world.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.”\n \nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\n●  \tSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\n●  \tCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\n●  \tReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools with which to think.\n●  \tInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\n●  \tBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps, ask the LLM for non-overlapping options, and pick.\n●  \tExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\n●  \tRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you.\n \nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\n \nPrinciples are ideas you keep in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n  \nNote: Do not memorize this list.\nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought.\nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n  📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n  🤲\nPrinciple\n 🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like:\n “Who would know how to answer this question? What is their job?”\n\n “What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n “What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?”\n\n\n\n(The more specific information you provide, the better.\nExploration:\n Get the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique and explain\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a person who will disagree.\n\n For instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\n Actively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the expert's domain. Once you pick your template, ask it questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper.\nIndependent Reflection:\n Leave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency:\n Ask the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI for A number of diverse and non-overlapping options for your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\n Asking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions.

What are the key principles from the INSPIRE framework that should be prioritized in the activity design?\n   - The activity should focus on inquiry-based learning, reflective learning, and self-directed learning, as these principles are closely aligned with the SCRIBER framework and promote deep understanding and personal growth.\n\n2. How can the activity design incorporate the SCRIBER framework to enhance learning outcomes?\n   - The activity should include prompts and techniques that encourage learners to seek information, critique their work, reflect on their progress, inquire about new topics, broaden their perspectives, explain their reasoning, and engage in recursive learning.\n\n3. What assessment methods can be used to measure the effectiveness of the activity in achieving the desired learning outcomes?\n   - The activity can incorporate assessment methods such as reflective writing scales, self-directed learning readiness scales, and problem-based learning assessment rubrics to evaluate learners' progress and the activity's effectiveness.\n\n4. How can the activity be designed to promote entrepreneurial self-efficacy and resilience?\n   - The activity should include elements that challenge learners to step out of their comfort zones, persevere through obstacles, and develop confidence in their ability to solve problems and navigate uncertainty.\n\n5.

The activity design incorporates a variety of learning approaches, such as experiential learning and reflection, which can cater to different learning styles.\n4. The assessment methods are diverse and relevant to the learning objectives, providing a comprehensive evaluation of learners' progress.\n5. The observable evidence is specific and measurable, allowing for effective tracking of learners' growth and achievement.\n\nCons:\n1. The chart may be overwhelming for some users due to the amount of information presented, making it less accessible and actionable.\n2. The specific techniques and prompts from the SCRIBER framework are not explicitly mentioned, which may make it difficult for facilitators to implement the activity effectively.\n3.

What level of detail would be most helpful for facilitators to understand and apply the scoring criteria consistently?\n2. How can we ensure that the scoring criteria are specific enough to provide meaningful feedback while still being concise and easy to use?\n3. What examples or indicators would be most useful to include in the scoring criteria to illustrate the different levels of achievement?\n\nNow, I'll think through the process of determining the appropriate level of detail for the scoring criteria:\n\n1. Review the learning objectives and components:\n   - Ensure that the scoring criteria align with the learning objectives and the key components of the activity.\n   - Identify the most critical aspects of each component that need to be evaluated.\n\n2. Consider the user's perspective:\n   - Think about the facilitators who will be using the scoring framework and their level of expertise.\n   - Determine the level of detail that would be most helpful for them to apply the criteria consistently and provide meaningful feedback.\n\n3. Balance specificity and conciseness:\n   - Aim to provide specific criteria that clearly differentiate between the different levels of achievement.\n   - However, keep the criteria concise and easy to understand to ensure that the framework is user-friendly and not overwhelming.\n\n4. Include relevant examples or indicators:\n   - For each component, identify key examples or indicators that illustrate the different levels of achievement.\n   - Include these examples in the scoring criteria to provide concrete guidance and improve consistency in evaluation.\n\nAfter reviewing our entire context, I don't believe we're missing any critical components in the middle of the process. The current components (Learning Objectives, Key SCRIBER Techniques, Activity Examples, and Assessment and Evidence) cover the essential aspects of the activity design and evaluation.\n\nBased on this analysis, I recommend providing scoring criteria that are specific enough to differentiate between levels of achievement while remaining concise and easy to use. Including 1-2 examples or indicators for each score level (0, 1, 3, and 5) should provide sufficient guidance without overwhelming the user. The criteria for scores 2 and 4 can be inferred based on their position between the other scores.\n\nHere's an example of how the scoring criteria could be presented for the \"Key SCRIBER Techniques\" component:\n\n| Score | Criteria |\n|-------|----------|\n| 0     | No evidence of SCRIBER techniques being used in the activity. |\n| 1     | Minimal use of SCRIBER techniques, with only 1-2 techniques being applied superficially. |\n| 3     | Moderate use of SCRIBER techniques, with 3-4 techniques being applied effectively. Examples: Reflective writing prompts and peer feedback are used to support the Reflect and Critique techniques. |\n| 5     | Full integration of all 7 SCRIBER techniques throughout the activity, with each technique being applied effectively and strategically. Examples: Learners engage in iterative problem-solving (Recurse), explore diverse perspectives (Broaden/Contract), and articulate their reasoning (Explain). |\n\nBy providing this level of detail in the scoring criteria, we strike a balance between specificity and conciseness, making the framework more helpful and actionable for facilitators.",

            "extracted_content": "Build Your Ideal Journal\n& Become a Daily Journaler\nIntroduction \nYour activity is to design and establish your ideal journaling practice. We will create your customized, idealized, amazing journaling method to help you see and build a beautiful personal and work life. \nTo do this, we will identify your needs and intentions(your why), then pick questions for your daily journal based on this video. In this video, Cam introduces the VOMIT system, which was developed after 15 years of experimentation with various journaling methods. He has found five fundamental reasons for Journaling across many methods and compiles a list of journaling prompts we can steal use.\nReasons for Journaling (VOMIT)\nThe VOMIT system stands for Vent, Obligations, Mindset, Ideate, and Trajectory. Here’s a breakdown of each component:\nV - Vent\nVent to release, find clarity, and get into the writing flow. “Start with what makes you mad” - because that’s usually the easiest thing to write as it has energy behind it, bonus: it takes the chaos in the mind and puts it down in writing where you can see it to do something about them.\nPrompt: “What is alive in you right now?”, “What makes you mad?”\n\nO - Obligations\nWriting down obligations to mind-dumping all your activities and responsibilities that occupy your mind. Writing them down helps free up mental space for solving problems instead of just storing them. \nSuggested 4-step method: \nObligation dump\nCluster into buckets\nPrioritize,\nMake a to-do list\nPick the absolute minimum that needs to be done and forget the rest for today.\nTo help prioritize, you can ask a guiding question. Try this one: \n\nWhat one thing on this list would make everything else easier or unnecessary? \n\nM - Mindset\nMindset is often shared as the key to success, yet practical methods to develop mindsets and which mindsets to develop are often left vague. In my research into how people grow when catastrophic changes happen, I found the following two mindsets to be critical: \nA secure and empowered mindset that supports the development of communal relationships of trust and sharing. \nA mindset of “deliberate rumination” - where the first thing that comes to your mind when disaster strikes is “How could this possibly be something good?” or if that’s not possible, “What opportunities are now available given this terrible situation.” It’s important to note that this is not a “positivity” mindset; it’s a realistic mindset empowered to find new opportunities, build relationships, and walk the narrow path of opportunity that is always present for those seeking them.\n\nCam suggests you can train and improve your mindset through various prompting techniques:\nReframing: Find a new way to see your situation and build a mindset you value. Perhaps you can identify how others respond to similar situations and ask yourself how they would respond and what they would ask themselves.\nReframing prompt: \n“How is this the best thing that has ever happened to me?”\n\nPossibility: Find possibility with “because of” statements. Affirmations are lame. To build self-confidence, your affirmations must come with evidence, so state your affirmation + because. The because can be the tiny first step to why the affirmation is already true.\nPossibility Prompt:\n “I am a …” Ex: “I am a great writer… because I am practicing writing right now!” It helps you create evidence.\n\nInversion: Ask the opposite to see what you want. Invert your goal, so you see what you want.\nInversion Prompt: \nThe opposite of what I want is… Ex: “I want to be ungrateful and be certain my friends know I don’t notice or appreciate their support.”\n\nPerspective: Others can see us better than we can. Gain perspective by pretending to give yourself advice as your friend.\nPerspective Prompt: \nAs your friend, I notice that… \n\nDiscipline: Find a way to stick to your journaling practice. Discipline is often connected to identity. I must tell you, after reading all this, you are a Daily Journaler. \n\nGratitude: Gratitude is one of the most researched journaling prompts, demonstrating many positive health and mental outcomes. \nGratitude prompt: \nYou can pick three things you’re grateful for today: one everyday thing, one thing you helped make happen, and something that happened by chance. \n\n\nI - Ideate\nIt’s a tool for ideation, helping to generate ideas by using techniques like setting time-bound challenges, asking how others would solve a problem, and posing open-ended questions to stimulate the brain.\n\nA simple method for ideation is to set a timer for 5 minutes and write as many ideas as possible around a theme that is important to you that day. This is related to free writing, so don’t slow down or stop, even if the ideas are silly!\nIdeation Prompt 1: 10 Ideas to [solve my problem, make my child smile, grow my business 10x…] (remember the quality of the ideation is related to the quality of the question).\nIdeation Prompt 2: “How would [Steve Jobs, my dad, a carpenter, etc] solve this problem?\nIdeation Prompt 3: If you’re journaling before night, a good prompt might be to open a question so your mind works on it as you sleep. For example, “The most important question for me today is: ….”\n\nT - Trajectory\nJournaling helps track and tweak personal and professional trajectories by reflecting on whether current actions align with long-term goals and assessing visible and hidden life satisfaction metrics.\n\nTrajectory Direction Prompt:\n\nIdentify your goal and place it on the top of the page; find evidence of things you’ve been doing that day/week/month that pull you towards your goal or push you away from achieving it. Then, identify ways to add more of what takes you towards your goal to your to-do list and find ways to mitigate the things that push you away. \n \n\nTrajectory Hidden Measures Prompt: Pull out the hidden, yet essential, measures like happiness with this prompt:\nWhat excited me today?\nWhat drained me of energy today?\nWhat did I learn?\nIf you use this “trajectory” journaling method for long enough, you’ll quickly see how you need to adjust your life. \n“Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” ― Howard Thurman.\nMy Ideal Journal Method\nStart with why. alwhys - ahm- always. To do this, identify your intentions, find which element of the VOMIT system they fit into, and design the questions you want to answer. Remember, the goal is to start a daily journaling habit, so keep it short so you can do it in under 20 minutes.\n[TEMPLATE Name]’s Journaling Practice Intentions \nBecome more grateful and connected with my friends and family.\nRemove clutter from my mind. \nHonor the ideas I am blessed with by giving them a good home and acting on them at the right time.\nTo slow down and do the right things instead of doing many things.\n\nFor example, the author of this exercise would write:\nVent: What feelings were present the most in the last 24 hours, what could they be telling you?\nObligations: What do you need to do? What three things from that list can you do today?\nMindset: “What are three things I’m grateful for?”\nIdeation: What are ten ways I can simplify, reduce, or remove items from my obligation list?\nTrajectory: At the end of the day, I will answer the following:\nWhat excited me today?\nWhat drained me of energy today?\nWhat did I learn?\n\nNow that you have your idealized journaling method, buy yourself a nice notebook and pen and set a timer for 20 minutes. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. Do your first round right now. Remember… you are a Daily Journaler.\n"

            "extracted_content": "Build Your Ideal Journal\n& Become a Daily Journaler\nIntroduction \nYour activity is to design and establish your ideal journaling practice. We will create your customized, idealized, amazing journaling method to help you see and build a beautiful personal and work life. \nTo do this, we will identify your needs and intentions(your why), then pick questions for your daily journal based on this video. In this video, Cam introduces the VOMIT system, which was developed after 15 years of experimentation with various journaling methods. He has found five fundamental reasons for Journaling across many methods and compiles a list of journaling prompts we can steal use.\nReasons for Journaling (VOMIT)\nThe VOMIT system stands for Vent, Obligations, Mindset, Ideate, and Trajectory. Here’s a breakdown of each component:\nV - Vent\nVent to release, find clarity, and get into the writing flow. “Start with what makes you mad” - because that’s usually the easiest thing to write as it has energy behind it, bonus: it takes the chaos in the mind and puts it down in writing where you can see it to do something about them.\nPrompt: “What is alive in you right now?”, “What makes you mad?”\n\nO - Obligations\nWriting down obligations to mind-dumping all your activities and responsibilities that occupy your mind. Writing them down helps free up mental space for solving problems instead of just storing them. \nSuggested 4-step method: \nObligation dump\nCluster into buckets\nPrioritize,\nMake a to-do list\nPick the absolute minimum that needs to be done and forget the rest for today.\nTo help prioritize, you can ask a guiding question. Try this one: \n\nWhat one thing on this list would make everything else easier or unnecessary? \n\nM - Mindset\nMindset is often shared as the key to success, yet practical methods to develop mindsets and which mindsets to develop are often left vague. In my research into how people grow when catastrophic changes happen, I found the following two mindsets to be critical: \nA secure and empowered mindset that supports the development of communal relationships of trust and sharing. \nA mindset of “deliberate rumination” - where the first thing that comes to your mind when disaster strikes is “How could this possibly be something good?” or if that’s not possible, “What opportunities are now available given this terrible situation.” It’s important to note that this is not a “positivity” mindset; it’s a realistic mindset empowered to find new opportunities, build relationships, and walk the narrow path of opportunity that is always present for those seeking them.\n\nCam suggests you can train and improve your mindset through various prompting techniques:\nReframing: Find a new way to see your situation and build a mindset you value. Perhaps you can identify how others respond to similar situations and ask yourself how they would respond and what they would ask themselves.\nReframing prompt: \n“How is this the best thing that has ever happened to me?”\n\nPossibility: Find possibility with “because of” statements. Affirmations are lame. To build self-confidence, your affirmations must come with evidence, so state your affirmation + because. The because can be the tiny first step to why the affirmation is already true.\nPossibility Prompt:\n “I am a …” Ex: “I am a great writer… because I am practicing writing right now!” It helps you create evidence.\n\nInversion: Ask the opposite to see what you want. Invert your goal, so you see what you want.\nInversion Prompt: \nThe opposite of what I want is… Ex: “I want to be ungrateful and be certain my friends know I don’t notice or appreciate their support.”\n\nPerspective: Others can see us better than we can. Gain perspective by pretending to give yourself advice as your friend.\nPerspective Prompt: \nAs your friend, I notice that… \n\nDiscipline: Find a way to stick to your journaling practice. Discipline is often connected to identity. I must tell you, after reading all this, you are a Daily Journaler. \n\nGratitude: Gratitude is one of the most researched journaling prompts, demonstrating many positive health and mental outcomes. \nGratitude prompt: \nYou can pick three things you’re grateful for today: one everyday thing, one thing you helped make happen, and something that happened by chance. \n\n\nI - Ideate\nIt’s a tool for ideation, helping to generate ideas by using techniques like setting time-bound challenges, asking how others would solve a problem, and posing open-ended questions to stimulate the brain.\n\nA simple method for ideation is to set a timer for 5 minutes and write as many ideas as possible around a theme that is important to you that day. This is related to free writing, so don’t slow down or stop, even if the ideas are silly!\nIdeation Prompt 1: 10 Ideas to [solve my problem, make my child smile, grow my business 10x…] (remember the quality of the ideation is related to the quality of the question).\nIdeation Prompt 2: “How would [Steve Jobs, my dad, a carpenter, etc] solve this problem?\nIdeation Prompt 3: If you’re journaling before night, a good prompt might be to open a question so your mind works on it as you sleep. For example, “The most important question for me today is: ….”\n\nT - Trajectory\nJournaling helps track and tweak personal and professional trajectories by reflecting on whether current actions align with long-term goals and assessing visible and hidden life satisfaction metrics.\n\nTrajectory Direction Prompt:\n\nIdentify your goal and place it on the top of the page; find evidence of things you’ve been doing that day/week/month that pull you towards your goal or push you away from achieving it. Then, identify ways to add more of what takes you towards your goal to your to-do list and find ways to mitigate the things that push you away. \n \n\nTrajectory Hidden Measures Prompt: Pull out the hidden, yet essential, measures like happiness with this prompt:\nWhat excited me today?\nWhat drained me of energy today?\nWhat did I learn?\nIf you use this “trajectory” journaling method for long enough, you’ll quickly see how you need to adjust your life. \n“Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” ― Howard Thurman.\nMy Ideal Journal Method\nStart with why. alwhys - ahm- always. To do this, identify your intentions, find which element of the VOMIT system they fit into, and design the questions you want to answer. Remember, the goal is to start a daily journaling habit, so keep it short so you can do it in under 20 minutes.\n[TEMPLATE Name]’s Journaling Practice Intentions \nBecome more grateful and connected with my friends and family.\nRemove clutter from my mind. \nHonor the ideas I am blessed with by giving them a good home and acting on them at the right time.\nTo slow down and do the right things instead of doing many things.\n\nFor example, the author of this exercise would write:\nVent: What feelings were present the most in the last 24 hours, what could they be telling you?\nObligations: What do you need to do? What three things from that list can you do today?\nMindset: “What are three things I’m grateful for?”\nIdeation: What are ten ways I can simplify, reduce, or remove items from my obligation list?\nTrajectory: At the end of the day, I will answer the following:\nWhat excited me today?\nWhat drained me of energy today?\nWhat did I learn?\n\nNow that you have your idealized journaling method, buy yourself a nice notebook and pen and set a timer for 20 minutes. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. Do your first round right now. Remember… you are a Daily Journaler.\n"

      "content": " Thank you for providing the updated rubric and sharing your thoughts on the improvement ideas. Let me address your questions one by one.\n\n1. Incorporating assessment and back-propagation into the rubric:\nOne way to incorporate assessment and back-propagation into the rubric is to include a criterion that evaluates the activity's potential for informing future iterations or improvements. This could be called \"Continuous Improvement Potential\" and would assess the extent to which the activity generates meaningful data, insights, or feedback that can be used to refine the activity itself or inform the design of future activities.\n\nHere's an example of how this criterion could be defined:\n\nContinuous Improvement Potential:\n1. The activity does not generate any data, insights, or feedback that could inform future improvements.\n2. The activity generates minimal data, insights, or feedback, but it is not clear how this information could be used to improve the activity or inform future designs.\n3. The activity generates some data, insights, or feedback that could potentially inform future improvements, but the process for leveraging this information is not well-defined.\n4. The activity generates meaningful data, insights, or feedback, and there is a clear process for using this information to improve the activity or inform future designs.\n5. The activity is designed to continuously generate high-quality data, insights, or feedback, and there is a well-established, systematic process for using this information to drive ongoing improvements and innovations.\n\n2. Using the rubric for content improvement, creation, and assessment:\nTo use the rubric effectively for these purposes, consider the following suggestions:\n\na. Content Improvement:\n- Use the rubric to systematically evaluate existing content in your library, assigning scores for each criterion.\n- Identify the criteria where the content scores the lowest, and focus your improvement efforts on those areas.\n- Provide specific guidance or examples for how to improve the content based on the rubric's definitions for higher scoring levels.\n\nb. Content Creation:\n- Use the rubric as a checklist or guide during the content creation process to ensure that new activities align with best practices and target high levels of effectiveness.\n- Encourage content creators to refer to the rubric's definitions and examples for each criterion as they design new activities.\n- Establish a minimum threshold score that new content must meet before it is added to the library.\n\nc. Content Assessment and Suggestions:\n- Have program managers or learning designers use the rubric to assess content and identify areas for improvement.\n- Provide a structured template or form for assessors to document their scores, observations, and suggestions for each criterion.\n- Develop a process for aggregating and prioritizing the feedback from multiple assessors.\n- Create a repository of best practices, examples, or resources that program managers or learning designers can reference when providing suggestions for improvement based on the rubric's criteria.\n\nTo further support this process, consider creating a visual map or flowchart that illustrates how the rubric can be used at each stage (improvement, creation, assessment) and how the information flows between these stages. This can help users understand the bigger picture and how their contributions fit into the overall content development and refinement process.\n\nAdditionally, provide training or guidance materials to ensure that all users understand how to interpret and apply the rubric consistently. This could include example activities that demonstrate each scoring level for each criterion, as well as FAQs or common misconceptions to address.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the rubric can serve as a powerful tool for driving continuous improvement, ensuring high-quality content creation, and facilitating effective collaboration between program managers, learning designers, and other stakeholders.",

Incorporating assessment and back-propagation into the rubric:\nOne way to incorporate assessment and back-propagation into the rubric is to include a criterion that evaluates the activity's potential for informing future iterations or improvements. This could be called \"Continuous Improvement Potential\" and would assess the extent to which the activity generates meaningful data, insights, or feedback that can be used to refine the activity itself or inform the design of future activities.\n\nHere's an example of how this criterion could be defined:\n\nContinuous Improvement Potential:\n1. The activity does not generate any data, insights, or feedback that could inform future improvements.\n2. The activity generates minimal data, insights, or feedback, but it is not clear how this information could be used to improve the activity or inform future designs.\n3. The activity generates some data, insights, or feedback that could potentially inform future improvements, but the process for leveraging this information is not well-defined.\n4. The activity generates meaningful data, insights, or feedback, and there is a clear process for using this information to improve the activity or inform future designs.\n5. The activity is designed to continuously generate high-quality data, insights, or feedback, and there is a well-established, systematic process for using this information to drive ongoing improvements and innovations.\n\n2. Using the rubric for content improvement, creation, and assessment:\nTo use the rubric effectively for these purposes, consider the following suggestions:\n\na. Content Improvement:\n- Use the rubric to systematically evaluate existing content in your library, assigning scores for each criterion.\n- Identify the criteria where the content scores the lowest, and focus your improvement efforts on those areas.\n- Provide specific guidance or examples for how to improve the content based on the rubric's definitions for higher scoring levels.\n\nb. Content Creation:\n- Use the rubric as a checklist or guide during the content creation process to ensure that new activities align with best practices and target high levels of effectiveness.\n- Encourage content creators to refer to the rubric's definitions and examples for each criterion as they design new activities.\n- Establish a minimum threshold score that new content must meet before it is added to the library.\n\nc. Content Assessment and Suggestions:\n- Have program managers or learning designers use the rubric to assess content and identify areas for improvement.\n- Provide a structured template or form for assessors to document their scores, observations, and suggestions for each criterion.\n- Develop a process for aggregating and prioritizing the feedback from multiple assessors.\n- Create a repository of best practices, examples, or resources that program managers or learning designers can reference when providing suggestions for improvement based on the rubric's criteria.\n\nTo further support this process, consider creating a visual map or flowchart that illustrates how the rubric can be used at each stage (improvement, creation, assessment) and how the information flows between these stages.
