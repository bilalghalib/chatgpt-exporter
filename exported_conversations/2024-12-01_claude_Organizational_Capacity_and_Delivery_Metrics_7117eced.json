This vision is achieved by organizing various activities, cultural events, and festivals, as well as supporting government bodies involved in heritage conservation. Additionally, the foundation focuses on empowering youth and professionals through developmental training, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals to foster sustainable cities and communities.\n\n‏This concept was born in response to a series of wars and conflicts that had taken a toll on Nineveh Province, resulting in the loss of many historic cities and archaeological sites. These conflicts negatively impacted the city’s tangible and intangible heritage, cultural legacy, and led to a rise in youth unemployment, revealing an urgent need for skill development to prepare young people for the labor market and to inspire community-driven projects that benefit Iraqi society.\n\n‏The most significant and damaging event in the city’s modern history was the occupation by ISIS in 2014, followed by the liberation war in 2017. These events saw extremist groups destroy much of the remaining old city of Mosul. In response, a group of young people came together to launch the foundation as a voluntary effort, driven by a commitment to safeguarding Iraq’s identity. The project was launched to highlight archaeological and heritage sites, revive cultural heritage, and promote social cohesion among Nineveh’s diverse ethnicities and religions, aiming to foster peace and coexistence. This effort is seen as a vital step in encouraging displaced residents to return to their homes and to preserve the rich heritage and coexistence that define the city.\n\n‏The significance of establishing the “Mosul Heritage Foundation for Culture and Development” lies in preserving the historical character of the city, supporting heritage protection efforts alongside government bodies, and partnering with international organizations and the global community. The foundation also envisions fostering connections among youth through awareness-raising and developmental workshops to promote the heritage and history of Nineveh and Iraq, and implementing activities that develop the skills of professionals in culture, heritage, and development fields.\",\"The Foundation is committed to achieving its goals through building partnerships and expanding the fields it works in, especially in development and growth through culture, heritage, or capacity building.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s expertise and extensive network, it has earned significant community trust, with over 100,000 visitors to the Foundation in the past two years, as well as participants in its regular programs.\n\nTherefore, our vision is that the program aligns with our shared goals, and together we can achieve the best outcomes.\",\"We believe that the Mosul Heritage Foundation and the work team have field experience and a strong network of relationships, whether with government agencies, organizations, non-governmental organizations, or the local community.

Added interactive features:\n   - Hover over an organization's name in the legend or its card to see only that organization's radar chart\n   - Mouse out to see all organizations again\n\n3. Updated the layout:\n   - Changed to a 4-column grid for the metrics cards\n   - Added hover states to both legend items and metric cards\n   - Each organization has a consistent color across all elements\n\nKey observations with Qaf Lab added:\n1. They have the largest team size (38 members)\n2. Lower social media reach (700K) compared to the other organizations\n3. Strong in program alignment but slightly lower scores in other areas\n4. Moderate projects per team member ratio (0.53)\n\nWould you like me to adjust any aspects of the visualization or highlight different metrics?",

Added Qaf Lab to the comparison with its metrics:\n   - Organizational Capacity: 3.67\n   - Experience: 4.33\n   - Program Alignment: 5.00\n   - Target Audience: 4.33\n   - Training Capacity: 4.67\n   - Collaboration: 4.33\n\n2. Added interactive features:\n   - Hover over an organization's name in the legend or its card to see only that organization's radar chart\n   - Mouse out to see all organizations again\n\n3. Updated the layout:\n   - Changed to a 4-column grid for the metrics cards\n   - Added hover states to both legend items and metric cards\n   - Each organization has a consistent color across all elements\n\nKey observations with Qaf Lab added:\n1. They have the largest team size (38 members)\n2. Lower social media reach (700K) compared to the other organizations\n3. Strong in program alignment but slightly lower scores in other areas\n4. Moderate projects per team member ratio (0.53)\n\nWould you like me to adjust any aspects of the visualization or highlight different metrics?",

This vision is achieved by organizing various activities, cultural events, and festivals, as well as supporting government bodies involved in heritage conservation. Additionally, the foundation focuses on empowering youth and professionals through developmental training, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals to foster sustainable cities and communities.\n\n‏This concept was born in response to a series of wars and conflicts that had taken a toll on Nineveh Province, resulting in the loss of many historic cities and archaeological sites. These conflicts negatively impacted the city’s tangible and intangible heritage, cultural legacy, and led to a rise in youth unemployment, revealing an urgent need for skill development to prepare young people for the labor market and to inspire community-driven projects that benefit Iraqi society.\n\n‏The most significant and damaging event in the city’s modern history was the occupation by ISIS in 2014, followed by the liberation war in 2017. These events saw extremist groups destroy much of the remaining old city of Mosul. In response, a group of young people came together to launch the foundation as a voluntary effort, driven by a commitment to safeguarding Iraq’s identity. The project was launched to highlight archaeological and heritage sites, revive cultural heritage, and promote social cohesion among Nineveh’s diverse ethnicities and religions, aiming to foster peace and coexistence. This effort is seen as a vital step in encouraging displaced residents to return to their homes and to preserve the rich heritage and coexistence that define the city.\n\n‏The significance of establishing the “Mosul Heritage Foundation for Culture and Development” lies in preserving the historical character of the city, supporting heritage protection efforts alongside government bodies, and partnering with international organizations and the global community. The foundation also envisions fostering connections among youth through awareness-raising and developmental workshops to promote the heritage and history of Nineveh and Iraq, and implementing activities that develop the skills of professionals in culture, heritage, and development fields.\",\"The Foundation is committed to achieving its goals through building partnerships and expanding the fields it works in, especially in development and growth through culture, heritage, or capacity building.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s expertise and extensive network, it has earned significant community trust, with over 100,000 visitors to the Foundation in the past two years, as well as participants in its regular programs.\n\nTherefore, our vision is that the program aligns with our shared goals, and together we can achieve the best outcomes.\",\"We believe that the Mosul Heritage Foundation and the work team have field experience and a strong network of relationships, whether with government agencies, organizations, non-governmental organizations, or the local community.

Sortable Columns:\n   - Click any column header to sort ascending/descending\n   - Visual indicators show sort direction\n   - Default sort is by average score\n\n2. Search Functionality:\n   - Real-time filtering as you type\n   - Searches organization names\n\n3. Visual Enhancements:\n   - Color-coded score indicators (green for high, yellow for medium, red for low)\n   - Formatted numbers (M for millions, K for thousands)\n   - Hover effects on rows and headers\n   - Responsive design for mobile devices\n\n4. Key Metrics Displayed:\n   - Organization name\n   - Average score\n   - Social media reach\n   - Total employees\n   - Number of training programs\n   - Trainees per employee\n   - Number of topics covered\n\nTo use this on your website:\n\n1. Save the file as `organization-comparison.html`\n2. Upload to your web server\n3. The table will work immediately with no additional setup required\n\nThe table uses only vanilla JavaScript and CSS, with Chart.js as the only external dependency. Would you like any adjustments to the styling or functionality?",
