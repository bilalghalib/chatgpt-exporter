            "extracted_content": "Cluster 1: The Community as Curriculum\nKey Insight: The training is not about transferring content but building a resilient, supportive, and values-aligned community of practice.\n\nEvidence:\nHussam used micro-teaching to encourage peer learning, letting trainees present on small topics as a way to build confidence and community ownershipSolar - Interview Summa….\n\nMuayad emphasized daily sticky note reflections and group discussion, not as a performance check but as a way to collectively surface learning and create cohesionallinsights.\n\nSaliha’s TOT suggestion—trainers should co-create and own the program—is in harmony with this pattern.\n\nCluster 2: Empathy-Driven Sales Engineering\nKey Insight: Sales is not persuasion—it’s alignment. You help people see their own needs more clearly.\n\nPractices & Observations:\nOne trainer offered a guarantee: “If your room isn’t 10 degrees cooler after 3 weeks, don’t pay.” That is radical empathy + risk-sharing.\n\nMany trainers noted the challenge of explaining ROI; others used social proof (“فلان سوّى…”) to lower buyer skepticismallinsights.\n\nYou developed the concept of the \"sales engineer\" as the translator between market and human need—a cross-cutting figure in all modules.\n\nCluster 3: Environment as Teacher\nKey Insight: The city, the home, the roof, the air—all are sources of data and wisdom. We must learn to read them.\n\nNotables:\nShading is not just about sun exposure—it’s about understanding rooftops, neighbors, trees, and seasonal variation. Hussam and Mohammed both referenced tools and methods for thisBEIT Solar Energy Facil….\n\nThermal envelope awareness came through in stories about overheated battery boxes (e.g., “baytuna” stairwells), and the surprising insight that solar panels themselves provide shade that improves roof insulationBEIT Solar Energy Facil….\n\nThe window orientation = winter illness comment from a green architect is a gold quote—these are the invisible costs we must surface.\n\nCluster 4: Interdependency of Modules\nKey Insight: Solar, insulation, and architecture aren’t separate domains—they are layers of one integrated energy-and-care system.\n\nStructural Proposal:\nSolar Training Map: Focus on electrical energy flows, load matching, ROI, cooling through shading.\n\nInsulation Training Map: Focus on heat loss pathways, roof-wall-floor insulation priorities, lifespan of equipment (e.g., AC).\n\nArchitecture Module: Based on heritage wisdom + future needs. Students analyze old homes, extract design principles, and build modern adaptations.\n\nYou can even express these as energy anatomy maps: like body systems, each module studies a different flow—electric, thermal, ecological, and social.\n\nCluster 5: Seeing Beyond the System\nKey Insight: Financial logic alone doesn’t win hearts. Comfort, dignity, reduced illness, pride of place, and even property value matter.\n\nExamples:\nInsulation protects not only energy bills, but air quality and health.\n\nSolar reduces cooling load = longer AC life = lower repair costs.\n\nProper design improves resale value of a house—rarely considered but deeply motivating.\n\nThe emotional resonance of reconnecting to Mosul’s heritage architecture becomes a shared “why.”\n\nCluster 6: Case Study as Capstone, Not Just Content\nKey Insight: Having participants design for a real person (or persona) makes learning meaningful, builds confidence, and becomes a vehicle for actual job placement.\n\nArchitecture Adaptation:\nCreate client personas: home size, orientation, location, needs.\n\nHave teams design insulation retrofits or window/garden placement.\n\nPitch them at the “Green Festival” to real firms.\n\nSolar/Insulation Correlation:\nIf a roof is insulated, you need fewer panels.\n\nIf a window is reoriented, you reduce heating/cooling costs.\n\nEach insight compounds—students can model the cascade effect.\n\nNext Steps (Proposed Action Items)\nFor Story Organization:\nI’ll help you build a table or map of “Insight → Trainer → Design Impact” so you can reference who said what, for reports or presentations.\n\nWe can cluster insights across three domains: Solar | Insulation | Architecture.\n\nFor Final Deliverable:\nLet’s aim to draft a Facilitator-Stakeholder Document structured around:\n\nGuiding Philosophy – From skills to care\n\nThematic Patterns – The clusters above\n\nStakeholder Ecosystem – Market, trainers, learners, facilitators\n\nModule Maps – Solar, Insulation, Architecture (each with interventions, risks, opportunities)\n\nCapstone & Market Engagement Plan\n\nOpen Questions + Ongoing Research Agenda\n\nWould you like me to help you draft this now as an editable document or presentation? I can also start visualizing the stakeholder map or the training module “anatomies” if that would help crystallize the interdependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan you help me with this: I’ll help you build a table or map of “Insight → Trainer → Design Impact” so you can reference who said what, for reports or presentations.\nand write the final deliverable - keeping the authenticity of my language and how i say things while mantaining professionalism. I want it to sound like me make it a document \nCulster the insights \n\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nThought for 9 seconds\nBEIT Solar Training – Insight → Trainer → Design-Impact Map\n(draft deliverable – in Bilal’s voice, polished for reporting)\n\n1. Why this map matters\nWhen we pitch or report, I want to point at exactly who said what and how it reshaped the curriculum—no fuzzy attributions. This table is my quick-reference dashboard: insights are clustered by theme, each tied to the trainer who voiced it, and the concrete change we built into the 6-day course.\n\nCluster\tHigh-Value Insight (verbatim/summary)\tTrainer\tDesign Impact\tModule / Day\nA. Hands-On First\t«المتدرب حتى يقدر يروح يشتغل … يحتاج يشتغل بإيده» – Trainees must physically wire a system, not just watch.\tHussam\t70 % practical time; roof-top demo rig with 4 panels; every participant crimps, torques, energises.\tDay 4–6\nMohammed: “We don’t have anything called theory; we are all practical work.”\tMohammed\tOpen-the-inverter teardown in the first hour of Day 1 to set tone.\tDay 1\nB. Safety & Quality\tDC wiring spec ignored → fires. «المفروض الأسلاك المستخدمة هي أسلاك مخصصة لـ DC…»\tHussam\t45-min DC-vs-AC safety lab; sample 4 mm² PV cable + DC MCBs.\tDay 2\nWind load: «الري كله يتحرك… لازم يثبت بالأرض»\tHussam\tStructural calc mini-lab; torque-wrench assessment; mounting hardware station.\tDay 4\nCounterfeit batteries common – Muayad’s warning.\tMuayad\t“Good vs. bad” component gallery; datasheet-literacy mini-quiz.\tDay 3\nC. Local Language & Metrics\tIraqis speak in amps, not kWh. «شلون يحسبون استهلاك البيت بالأمبير»\tHussam\tAmp-based load worksheet, then convert to kW; conversion cheat-sheet.\tDay 1\nVisual over text – Mohammed’s teaching style.\tMohammed\tPhoto-heavy slides, component flashcards, mistake-wall gallery.\tThroughout\nD. Financial Reality\tUp-front cost is biggest barrier. «الحاجز الوحيد… مبلغ دفعة واحدة»\tHussam\tROI calculator spreadsheet; micro-finance options slide; invite loan-officer Day 6.\tDay 5–6\n“Expensive is actually cheaper” lifetime-cost story – Ali.\tAli\tTCO comparison cards (cheap vs. premium inverter).\tDay 5\nE. Storytelling & Reflection\tMuayad’s sticky-note daily review.\tMuayad\tEnd-of-day reflection wall (names on notes for M&E).\tDaily\nSaud’s problem-based scenarios drive engagement.\tSaud\tContinuous “Coffee Shop” case; evolving challenges each day.\tDay 1–6\nF. Industry & Jobs\tPeer success stories convince buyers. «دائماً نقول لهم فلان سوّى…»\tHussam\tLocal case-study library; running slide “House next door” ROI.\tDay 5\nSub-three-month internships secure jobs – Mohammed.\tMohammed\tCommitment letters from partner firms; mock interviews Day 6.\tPost-course\n\n2. Cluster rationale\nHands-On First – All five trainers hammered this. If it’s not in their hands, it’s not in their heads.\n\nSafety & Quality – DC fires and wind-tossed panels ruin reputations; we tackle the two biggest risk factors.\n\nLocal Language & Metrics – Speak amps and Arabic; visuals beat paragraphs.\n\nFinancial Reality – Selling solar in Mosul is a numbers game; we hand trainees the calculator.\n\nStorytelling & Reflection – Sticky notes + relatable stories = retention > lectures.\n\nIndustry & Jobs – Training is pointless if no one hires. We wire the course directly to employers.\n\n3. How to use this map in reports & decks\nAttribution: cite trainer + quote to show field-validated design.\n\nImpact: bullet the curriculum tweak so donors see the delta.\n\nClustering: keeps the narrative tidy—funders love thematic buckets.\n\nFeel free to drop this table straight into the facilitation guide appendix or pull individual rows into slide decks.

thorough understanding of what makes for effective solar installation training in the Mosul context. Each interview has added unique insights and perspectives:\n\nHussam provided valuable insights on market research, peer teaching, and the importance of after-sales service and maintenance.\nSaud contributed the competition-based assessment approach and the innovative \"solar festival\" concept for connecting trainees with employers.\nMohammed emphasized visual, hands-on learning without note-taking and mock job interviews as final assessment.\nAli focused on quality components, datasheet interpretation, and building relationships with major brands.\nMuayad added depth on simulation software, story-based learning techniques, government partnerships, and daily review methods.\n\nAs we've progressed through these interviews, our training plan has evolved from a basic outline to a comprehensive, culturally-appropriate curriculum that addresses the specific needs and challenges of the Mosul market. We've identified the critical importance of:\n\nPractical, hands-on learning over theoretical instruction\nVisual demonstration over note-taking\nQuality assessment skills for components\nDesign skills that balance cost with performance\nBusiness development alongside technical knowledge\nStrong connections to employment opportunities\n\nThe final training plan incorporates the best elements from each trainer's approach, creating a balanced curriculum that prepares trainees not just technically but also for the business aspects of solar installation in Mosul.\n\nAdditional Questions That Should Have Been Asked\nEquipment Specifics: What exact equipment (brands, models, quantities) would be needed to set up an optimal training facility for 20 trainees?\nCertification Details: What specific steps would be required to get RENAC or similar international recognition for the training certificates?\nProject Documentation: What templates and formats do you recommend for system design documentation and customer proposals?\nTrainee Selection: What criteria should be used to select trainees to ensure success?\nPost-Training Support: What ongoing support structure would be most effective for graduates?\nCurriculum Updates: How often should the curriculum be updated, and what emerging technologies should be incorporated?\nWomen's Participation: What specific strategies would encourage women's participation in the training and solar industry?\nRemote Areas: What modified approaches would be needed for training installers serving remote areas of Mosul province?\nCultural Adaptation: How should the training be modified to respect local cultural norms while maintaining technical standards?\nScaling Strategy: What approach would be most effective for scaling this training to other regions of Iraq?\nSuccess Metrics: What key performance indicators should be used to measure the training program's success?\nBusiness Models: What business models would be most sustainable for solar installers in Mosul's current economic climate?\n\nBy addressing these additional questions, we could further refine the training program to maximize its impact on job creation and sustainable energy adoption in Mosul.]]]\n\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nThought for 10 seconds\nBelow is a single, consolidated “Core Principles” sheet that merges the overlapping ideas from both of your source documents (the Solar-Training Facilitation Guide and the Diagram/Presentation Transformation Guide). Duplicate ideas have been combined; complementary items have been nested or sequenced so you can drop this straight into the master facilitation file.\n\nSolar Training – Unified Core Principles (Mosul Context)\n#\tPrinciple\tPractical Implications for Trainers & Slide‐Designers\n1\tAudience-Ready Language\t• Use clear, simple phrases\n• Provide all technical terms bilingually (English / Arabic)\n• Minimise text on slides; rely on visuals & icons\n2\tMosul-Specific & Job-Ready\t• Integrate real component prices, suppliers, and case studies from Mosul\n• Emphasise dust, heat, wind, grid instability, and local generator costs in every example\n3\t70 % + Hands-On Learning\t• Minimum 70 % of total time on practical tasks (wiring, mounting, commissioning)\n• Reserve roof/yard area & 4-panel demo rig for rotation stations\n4\tProgressive Skill-Build\t• Day-by-day flow: fundamentals → components → safety → design → business → full install\n• Each day ends with a link to tomorrow’s objective\n5\tVisual-First Teaching\t• Use diagrams, photos of local installs & “failure walls”\n• For slides:\n – Prefer timelines for processes\n – Flowcharts for decision logic\n – Simple circuit or ladder diagrams for wiring\n• Validate every Mermaid block; keep <16 text elements per diagram\n6\tMemorable Storytelling\t• Anchor each key concept with a local success or failure story (Muayad’s method)\n7\tProblem-Based & Peer Learning\t• Daily mini-problems/scenarios;

We got that from hearing about some of the people that went through these other training programs and how they continue to support each other until this day. We had a big insight about connecting to the market by bringing the market into the classroom and inviting the companies to come judge the solicitation projects. We had a big idea to get people to be more interactive and start to move into a sales engineering focus, to combine the financial literacy element with the elements that we've been working on through sales engineering. Another really big idea has been to not focus so much on the green and solar elements, but to focus on solving problems for people, and making these systems, rather than something that seems to be coming from outside, something that is coming in. Some of the open questions that every trainer has been working on and talking about have been about culture and mindset shift, and the importance of seeing it done with others and experiencing what it's like. We had some big insights as well, just in terms of practicality for the solar training. In terms of solar panels installed, you need to think not only about what's above them, where the sun is and the shade, and also there are a lot of tall trees covering the buildings, or a lot of tall buildings creating shadows. It's not exactly what we need to assess, but what we need to assess is the inside as well. It turns out solar panels provide a little bit of shading from the sun, insulation, and because of that they are going to cool the room down below them, so to pick the room that you want to cool underneath it. Another one is, you know, many people don't think about this when they install a solar panel, but one of the most important things isn't the panel, or the inverter, or even the batteries, it's the box that holds it all. Because heat actually affects the efficiency of things, and this affects the cost because of the length of the wires required, and so when people are not thinking about where they're going to put the equipment in the box, then they get to this problem of finishing the install and coming to the point of putting everything together and putting it in a bedroom, or putting it in what they call a baytuna, and this baytuna is some kind of staircase, external, and it can get really hot, it's like a greenhouse. And so that was a really interesting aha moment, and I think it would be really nice to pull out all these moments of aha, and all of the questions that I tried to ask all of the trainers, for instance the question of what are the three biggest problems you see with solar installs, and then one of the other facilitation techniques that we had come up with through this was kind of an I-5 facilitation technique, where you get a problem and you have teams and you make it a competition to find as many problems as you can in a photo or in a system. Some other interesting fun ideas or insights was data sheet reading and understanding sort of choice thinking in design, in that you might, with a little bit of changes, really create a step-level change in the cost of a panel install, and so if you encourage someone to take their hot water heater or maybe one of their fridges, and if they don't use that often off of the solar battery, then you can actually reduce maybe a battery pack to panels, and really reduce the cost a lot for the install, whereas if you continued with the same sort of amperage, so it's not just like what are your amperages needs, it's a little bit of a dialogue and a discussion about what are your amperages needs, and this is where it switches into this mode of trying to understand the needs and to be on the customer's team, and so that's going to be a kind of cross-cutting theme, I think that might be something interesting to start talking about as well, it's like what are the cross-cutting themes and ideas that we're developing for the entire module, and what does a day look like in the BATE module training, and yeah, I think it's some good content.Yeah, I like that. I like bringing these big, kind of overarching themes and ideas into the facilitator-stakeholder mapping deliverable. That's what this deliverable is supposed to be. We do have open questions as well. I think that's really good to identify and describe. And, um... Yeah, I think this idea of, like, taking these photos could be really good, of the bad server installs. The other things that were surprising are things like, I had no idea that you have to wash the server panel with lukewarm water at the same temperature as the device. You don't have to boil the water, you can track them. You know, there's all these little details that you kind of would have never guessed that matters a lot. And I think, you know, connecting to this transformation is also really around aligning around the goal and really distinguishing what we're doing from the technical and vocational skills training. So, the technical and vocational skills training is focusing on the much longer and more detailed around, like, the technical stuff. We're assuming that the people have a lot of skills already in terms of, you know, the people with the IR and electronics and all of these things, but they really need a hands-on, really deep understanding of what it is like to convince or to really work on. Basically, every single call I had with people along every one of the trainers' calls was mentioning the idea of the community in Mosul needing to change its outlook and perspective on what the tool is. So, the reality is the market for solar is huge. The market for insulation is also huge. The possibility of green elements being involved within architecture firms' plans and implementation has a lot of potential. And so, there are these jobs that are being left on the table because people are going for traditional or imitative designs because of cultural forces and trends. And so, to think about our training as not helping only a one-directional connection of people with skills and then people with skills to market, it's more like people with skills to market and market to the people with the skills. And the people that do that sort of translation are sales engineers. And I've talked with different trainers asking them this question of how to work on that. And I was doing one of my calls with an architect that I really think I had my answer, which was, we need to be on the same team as problem-solvers, empathizing, trying to understand the needs of the people we're working with, and then the thing will sell itself. We're not here to sort of push an ideology or ensure that people are installing solar panels or going green. The reality is that Mosul was green 200 years ago because people were caring about their communities. People were caring about how it felt to live in their homes without electricity being able to sort of compensate and cover for the poor design decisions. So, currently, we are building things with materials that aren't sustainable because the market forces, including subsidies from the Iraqi government, makes it so that people don't have to necessarily think too hard about insulation. Although insulation, when it is installed, has so many benefits, a lot of them would show up in very similar market forces. The challenge is helping people see these benefits. So, for instance, insulation is beneficial clearly in reducing the use of electricity, and that's a cost. But one of the costs that I also didn't consider and I had an aha moment about was when you are using electricity, you have to run your AC, and everything has a lifespan. The more you use your air conditioner, the more likely it is to go bad sooner. And so, even if having your insulation doesn't mean you will never use the air conditioning, but if it reduces the number of days a year, hours a year, that it's operating, your air conditioning unit will last longer. And it would require less repair, and this is a cost that is hard to see. And so, what happens is sales engineering is helping people really see the problem. It's sort of like glasses for society, you know? And so, once these problems become clear, the solutions that this program is training people to offer can also become clear. And that can be a really interesting angle and focus of the program. And some of the kind of common practices that we're trying to include is real-life scenarios. We have had a lot of people in the private sector, businesses, say, I was asking them about finding us internships and X, Y, or Z. And they told us, if you have really good, high-quality people, we will snatch them up. We will come and take them. And so, the suggestion emerged to not attempt at having a sort of documented way to show people having new skills and having it on paper, but to find ways of practically and tangibly demonstrating those skills directly in front of potential employers and potential customers. And so, part of that means, don't just design an abstract project, go design it for your family, design it for a cousin. When you have these interviews with them, bring back the insights from the interviews. We want to be sure that we have a way to learn from each other's experiences and the questions that people might have about installation, solar, or architecture. And to have these be places where there's also an opportunity for real, practical work. It's not that you're going to build a demo unit in the office. I've had people from the field say that they would be willing to take people on site to installs and have them get real, practical training with the people on the ground. And then, lastly, there's an incredible thing that's happening where people in the solar industry are offering to give free product to people to install for their demo installs and then to pay only when the customer pays later.Yeah, I kind of want to reflect a little bit more on what we were talking about with the with the installation people and the architecture people. So, I haven't had many calls with them yet. I'm still focused on getting insights from the people in the solar ecosystem. And I've interviewed so far six people. I'll interview my seventh today. And so, we're getting a good stretch of people in solar. The installation people were interesting because they don't have a strong market. It's actually, for this market that's very ripe, that the likely actual solution is pretty clear. There's also some really interesting ways I've seen people pitch and sell their solutions. For instance, they would say, hey, listen, if your room is not 10 degrees cooler in three weeks after you install, we'll measure the inside temperature and the outside temperature. If it's not 10 degrees different inside and outside, then you don't pay for the install. So, it's not exactly a loan, but it's a guarantee. And so, this guarantee is pretty cool. And I like hearing about it. So, I think that there may be things that we can learn from that to help with increasing installs of solar and other things where people might not really believe that it can make that big of a difference. And this idea of installation having a pretty big impact on energy consumption and overall comfort, the surprising thing is it's not only comfort. It's not just the idea of things being cheaper. What happens is it's actually also a way to get just better air. You know, it's like the benefit of being somewhere that has insulation, green space, that is going to be really a nice place to live. More than a place that is closed and is running ACs at 16 degrees, constantly damaging their equipment and making it so that the air is cold and dry. And it's actually related to this other element where I was talking with somebody from the green architecture field. And he was suggesting that it's very possible that there are people that have airflow in their house, not just airflow, but even a window at the right angle. This very simple decision for at what angle you want your manada or the window to be letting light in makes a difference in who gets colds and who doesn't get colds. And when he was saying that, I realized this way of talking with people to show them the benefits of things. Sure, you can use a lot of financial arguments, but there's going to be social intelligence. There's going to be also a kind of collective diverse intelligence. And this leads us to another principle, which is let the community surprise us with what they find. So since we're dealing with experts, people that have experience, we're thinking to have them sort of lead the way on what we can learn from the ecosystem. So for instance, the people that I'm talking to have mentioned that the classroom itself, one of the techniques that they like to do is have the classroom discuss an answer before they give the answers. And I think that is especially important for things that we're not entirely sure of. So for instance, in architecture, one of the ideas isn't to go and make a bunch of proposals, but it is to make a research and a case study for thinking about how to be sustainable in a way that is really focused on the person and their needs and their quality of life and the holistic nature of that human being. And in this way, you think about whether they get sick in the winter and whether the light has any impact on the amount of the viral load in the house and the airflow. You don't just think, OK, so they need energy. They spend this much. Let's replace it with solar panels. There's a way of thinking a little bit more broadly. And so this way of problem solving extends across all of the different modules. But I really think the glue that holds it together is that principle of caring for the person. And I think that is the step after the step of having this attitude of we're here to create jobs for young people in the reconstruction efforts of Mosul and to make houses more green through retrofitting and potentially some new architecture, new buildings. And when you have that in mind, when you realize that the problem in Mosul is huge and the climate change is happening and the price of energy daily is rising and people are struggling and the solutions are right there, literally right there. And then a lot of the solutions are also able to be derived from students through their process of just empathizing, being curious, asking questions and thinking systematically. And so learning problem solving skills, learning creativity skills, learning communication skills, empathy skills. This isn't an extra thing. I think that this is sort of the undercurrent that will guide our actions across all of these different decisions. I was talking with people in the solar field who at some point they found someone who had an install that was so big and they were not pulling enough energy from the system because there's off-grid and hybrid in Iraq. It's a lot more expensive to go hybrid and he only had an off-grid system and there was no way of putting energy back into the grid. And so he was like, why don't you give some to your neighbors? Why don't you add some more consumption? And that's a kind of thing that wouldn't be top of mind to someone to ask otherwise when they're not thinking about the person, their life, their relationships, how they are in their homes. And yeah, so I sort of think that this kind of makes me want to tell everybody in every module about a little bit about the other modules because at some point they might need to say, listen, I want to install a solar panel for you, but the right thing to do is to pass you off to the installation guys. They're awesome. And that leads us to another element of all this, which is the community element. I think it's really important to be building a long-term community. A lot of people that were in these training interviews had an experience of training themselves where they were a part of these ecosystems and they've mentioned that they've really benefited from them and they really appreciated them and they connect with them in the long term. And so even if we have individual groups meeting, I do think having some activities and places digitally where they can connect could be really helpful. It could be as simple as an additional WhatsApp group. Also, this brings me to some of the other elements of like connecting people to the market, which is I was talking with Saliha and Saliha had two really great ideas. The facilitators have to feel that the training is theirs. So instead of coming to the facilitation TOT and me coming and saying, hey, I'm going to teach you something to give to other people. Here's the slides go deliver. It's, hey, I'm a facilitator of facilitators. We're actually creating the context for learning and putting the right materials, data sheets, inspiration, experiences, so that people can actually learn what they need to learn to do these different things and to support customers in becoming more green. And then the other one is the end of project opening where we were thinking about suggesting a sort of green festival where we get to showcase the different products, the different people, the trainees and the project so they’re kept on projects from the architecture experience the material for all of different kinds of installation maybe a map of all the homes that have already done some of these installations some of the open questions and I’m still hoping to get some fraction on our case studies some actual case studies and if the you know the trainers are willing to give me some photos that would be great. I really want to follow up on this idea of having all of the judges for the capstone projects. You know be from the industry and to connect people in in the kind of real way I really like the idea we had from Mohamad Khan about getting people to you know give them product for free and support them during the moments of installation and to do some sort of quality assurance and customer reassurance by inspecting it, and having that be their potential after project project and for the architecture side of things there is still some work on the design, but it’s emerging this idea of having it be a way to gather a sort of set of criteria that different firms can be inspired by and that may serve to one day be the backdrop of a kind of like you know, Iraqi, greenhouse, checklist, criteria, and to do that we had this thought to go to the old city to think of the people and how they used to live in the different design decisions that they’ve had in their materials and what it meant the principles and to try to come up with a sort of structured approach of digesting that information taking photos and then working on creating thinking about building a modern version of these things like what makes sense today when our house sizes went from 600 m² to 100 m² what can we actually do now that makes sense there for a garden does a garden still make sense to window gardens make an impact at all and I actually have this sort of research project phase and then in order to connect them with the market even more as we had this idea that we could get people to give us real life design requirements for a person right size of the house the number of families members the orientation place in mostly all of all the information we could possibly need and to create a persona for us of the of the client and then for the trainer or for other participants to take on that persona and they have people designed for that person you know in a real map and so when the architecture firms come to the graduation day, we will be presenting there their work to them will tell them we already designed the thing for you, we have a few ideas from a few of our teams here from our program and if you like it, you can, you can take it if you don’t and you could, but you know, take it and maybe consider this person as a as an intern and I help them get some real work experience in building it or if you like it, but you don’t want to take the design because you don’t think the customer will take it then still they want an internship and I think that’s a really interesting way of connecting them and one of the things that I want to do and maybe I need your help to do is to see the relationship between all of the different trainings, solar installation, and architecture, and kind of create a pattern that is the same across all of them for insulation. I think the idea is to kind of do something sort of like the map of the architecture of the old city and find the principles like look like go look at a home and think of a map of all the intervention places where energy is lost right and let’s think about how we can cap stop that right and it could be painting white on the roof and it could be adding insulation on the walls. It could be adding installation on the ceiling and then like what are the difference intervention points? What are the different materials? Let’s read the date sheets for the materials and what are the requirements there’s all the failure elements of like what could possibly go wrong The difference between the solar and the insulation is that the solar they definitely need a practice install once or twice at least and in the insulation the idea is to have the they call them the fanan- and then you can look through the whole house for an architect, and you think of that is the map as of energy and consumption and sustainability in terms of the person‘s comfort you look at the insulation and you think just in specific terms for heat loss and you think of the whole map for heat loss and then for solar I guess you have a map of the whole system of energy and energy gains and flows right so you kind of need to get familiar with a map and to know the territory and to know where things go wrong and what the benefits are and how they kind of interact with things for incense like underneath the solar panel it gets cooler that if there’s ever someone even hanging a picture frame, which was a really interesting problem that we we found that they might screw into the wall and accidentally cut the cable behind the wall and like that’s a problem that people need to think about how do you deal with it and then all of this I think under the frame of helping people find jobs by getting them to be creative to learn new systems and skills for interacting with those systems to help people see the benefits and the actual problem that they’re facing right like do you get cold? Every winter in summer is one of the questions from one of these architects and say yeah and he’s like it could be that you just have the wrong orientation of a window in your House. There are these kinds of questions and ways of interacting with people that isn’t so trying to be like a pushy convincing person that could be even more compelling and we’re in an interesting place where we have to make markets for the insulation field. The solar field is picking up. I think there’s enough of a trend there and it could be interesting to help people expand that and for the architecture it’s going to be a way of sort of giving the entire field more of a heritage and a connection to the foundational principles of thinking about helping people live good lives in their homes and in their cities and in doing that, maybe there are other stuff comes up like I say OK for this house you know we’re not gonna design it to need eight solar panels because we’re gonna actually install rooftop insulation from the beginning because the roof insulation is 60 to 70% of the efficiency versus the wall insulation being about 30 and so we really want to do that but that requires to remove the first layer from the roof which increases the cost and I’ve heard stories about people you know spending $100,000 on a house with an architect and Not wanting to add 2000 for the cost of insulation that will be coming back to them very soon and then other types of ways of maybe not being able to see so easily initially is that the sale of the house the cost of your house in the future will be better when it has insulation, and when it has solar installs, you might think of it as a cost, but it might immediately pay itself back if you sold the house tomorrow right and so these are things that people need to be made aware of within the community so that there is more realization of not just how these will solve the real problems not that these people are not really here to help me solve my problem with their their solutions and that’s the mindset that they really need to have and they really need to care, but also that there’s some benefit that they might not have even thought about including this idea of the increase of the sale of the home, etc., and the solar panels actually reducing the amount of energy needed to cool the upper floors because it shades the roof that already like these these things they’re interactive they play with each other a design of a solar panel unit might be altered completely if they add a bit of insulation or they work on their ceiling of all the windows and doors and so it goes from needing eight panels to needing six panels and if that happens, then they might even reduce the size of the battery packs, and it could drastically reduce the cost of the solar panel installation and potentially completely offset the need of the installation and therefore all of the different things that we’re training I think it needs to be interrelated and I’d love some help like gathering my thoughts and insights and I’m thinking about how to cluster them and how to organize them and if we can also cross correlate these insights and the stories that I’ve been telling with the people from the training documents and all of the interviews and to sort of show who said what so it’s not just me saying someone said I want to know like who said what so I can kind of refer to them and highlight them and cheer them on\n\n\nI sort of want to make what a standard program looks like as well based on all our conversations. I'm finding that they rhyme and would like a program generic outline (how we like to bring employers to \"judge\" final year projects and to have projects be connected to real world jobs that need to be done - go assess your cousins house, design a house for this architecture firms project that they need to do anyway, etc) - also a big insight in working to open new products and markets instead of competing - insulation is not a \"thing\" yet - we're working to standardize and to make a provable ROI for the wall insulation process, once people learn that skill and we work on the cultural understanding i think there's big openings there, same for solar water heaters - it's a much cheaper (foot in the door) and helps both locals and new trainers get their feet wet. - architecture we're producing a product of modern day heritage solution list which can be seen as a first step towards coming together as an ecosystem of architects and having a new design language and start to something that they would be held accountable to for by the govornment before htey get approved to start construction - i think this is a good start \n\nWhat's the standard program structure, principles, connection to jobs, opening up new spaces, \nWhat's the standard 6 day program stucture\nWhat's the daily workplan so every day is \"exactly the same\" and different every time - what are the things we want to do every day (group work, assess learnings from yesterday, etc...)\n\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nThought for 19 seconds\n1.

Through seven in-depth interviews with master trainers and extensive field observations, we've uncovered a fundamentally different approach to vocational training: one that creates sales engineers who can translate between market needs and human problems.\n\nThis document outlines our training philosophy, program structure, and the key insights that make this approach uniquely effective for Mosul's context. Rather than simply transferring technical knowledge, we're building a self-sustaining ecosystem where graduates become market-makers who can open new niches in solar, insulation, and green architecture.\n\n## 1. Guiding Philosophy: From Skills to Care\n\n> \"We realized we don't want a training that transfers material—we want a training that forms a community.\" — BG\n\nOur interviews with master trainers revealed a consistent pattern: the most successful training programs in Iraq don't just teach technical skills—they build cohesive communities that continue supporting each other years later. This insight fundamentally shifts our approach:\n\n### Community Over Content\nWhen we interviewed trainers like Muayad Hasan (MH) and Hussam Falih (HF), they kept referencing training cohorts that still support each other today, years after their programs ended. We're designing for this long-term community, not just short-term knowledge transfer.\n\n### Market-Embedded Learning\n> \"Let's bring the market into the classroom—have companies judge the capstone projects.\" — BG\n\nThe traditional model of \"train first, find jobs later\" fails repeatedly. Our approach embeds employers throughout the training process, culminating in having industry representatives judge final projects and make hiring decisions on the spot. As Mohammed Al-Qatan (MQ) emphasized, mock interviews with actual companies create real employment pathways.\n\n### Sales Engineering & Empathy\n> \"Sales engineering is society's glasses. Once people see the problem, the solution sells itself.\" — BG\n\nThe biggest barriers to adoption aren't technical—they're perceptual. People don't see the problem clearly enough to value the solution. Our training develops \"sales engineers\" who help customers understand their needs before proposing technical solutions.\n\n### Problem-First, Tech-Second\n> \"Stop leading with solar panels. Lead with solving people's problems.\" — BG\n\nWe heard this repeatedly from trainers: effective solar professionals in Mosul don't pitch technology—they solve human problems. This means starting with comfort, reliability, and economics rather than watts and volts.\n\n## 2. Program Structure: The 6-Day Framework\n\nBased on our interviews and field testing, we've developed a 6-day structure that balances technical skills with market connection:\n\n| Day | Core Theme | Employer Touch-Point | Capstone Progress |\n|-----|------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Understand the Need – site audit, load in amps, empathy interview | Kick-off talk by local installer on market gaps | Teams choose a real client (cousin's house / firm brief) |\n| 2 | Components & Safety – inverter tear-down, DC vs AC, datasheets | Supplier pop-up booth, price booklet update | Bill of materials draft |\n| 3 | Design & Simulation – software, shade, ROI calculator | Live Q&A with finance / loan officer | Preliminary system + costings |\n| 4 | Mount & Wire – roof rig, torque checks, battery cooling box | Field visit to active install (partner firm) | Hands-on mock install & test |\n| 5 | Sales Engineering – guarantee scripts, objection handling | Employers sit in on sales-pitch rehearsals | Final design, pitch deck, ROI proof |\n| 6 | Prove & Connect – timed assembly, interviews, certificates | Industry Jury scores installs & hires grads | Capstone judged, offers / internships issued |\n\nThis structure directly implements Hussam's emphasis on practical skills, Mohammed's focus on visual learning, Saud's competition-based assessment, and Muayad's storytelling approach—all while creating multiple touchpoints with potential employers.\n\n## 3. Daily Workplan: Consistent Structure, Fresh Content\n\nOur daily structure creates a predictable rhythm that helps trainees know what to expect, while allowing for varied content:\n\n| Time Block | Activity | Invariant Element | Variable Element |\n|------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 09:00-09:30 | Recap & Kahoot | 5-question quiz on yesterday | New quiz content daily |\n| 09:30-11:00 | Skill Sprint | Hands-on station rotation | Component/topic changes |\n| 11:00-11:15 | Peer Teach-Back | 1 learner explains to group | Randomly assigned learner |\n| 11:15-12:30 | Scenario Lab | Small-team problem photo (I-5) | Fresh photo / fault each day |\n| 13:30-14:15 | Industry Moment | Guest or market data drop | Different guest / dataset |\n| 14:15-15:30 | Capstone Studio | Teams advance real project | Specific milestone per day |\n| 15:30-15:45 | Reflection Wall | Sticky-note \"aha\" & question | New colour notes per day |\n| 15:45-16:00 | Look-Ahead | Preview tomorrow & logistics | Adjust for field trips / roof use |\n\nThis format implements Muayad's sticky-note review method, Hussam's peer-teaching approach, and Mohammed's emphasis on visual learning. Notably, we've increased hands-on time to over 70% of the total program, directly addressing the unanimous recommendation from all trainers.\n\n## 4. Technical Innovations & Surprising Insights\n\nThrough our interviews, we uncovered several technical insights that aren't commonly taught but create significant value:\n\n### Heat Management as System Design\n> \"The most important part isn't the panel or the inverter; it's the box—heat kills efficiency.\" — BG\n\nMultiple trainers highlighted that installation failures in Mosul often stem from poor heat management. When batteries or inverters are placed in \"baytuna\" (stairwell enclosures), the greenhouse effect destroys efficiency and shortens component life. Our training includes IR thermometer testing and cooling box design.\n\n### Panel Shading as Passive Cooling\n> \"Panels shade the roof—pick the room you actually want to cool underneath them.\" — BG\n\nA surprising insight from field observations: solar panels provide significant shading to the roof beneath, reducing the cooling load for top-floor rooms. Our training now includes strategic panel placement to maximize this dual benefit.\n\n### Cleaning Technique Matters\n> \"You clean panels with lukewarm water, same temperature as the glass—tiny detail, huge impact.\" — BG\n\nImproper cleaning can damage panels or reduce output. The training includes specific maintenance procedures based on local conditions, addressing Hussam's emphasis on proper cleaning as culturally important for system reputation.\n\n### DC Safety is Non-Negotiable\nSaud Maan (SM) and Ali Abkan (AA) both emphasized the critical importance of DC circuit safety, which is often overlooked. We've dedicated a full 45-minute lab to DC vs. AC safety principles, showing the consequences of improper components through a \"failure wall\" of damaged equipment.\n\n## 5. Market Connection & Trust Building\n\n### Performance Guarantees\n> \"If your room isn't ten degrees cooler in three weeks, you don't pay—that guarantee wins trust.\" — BG\n\nWe discovered installers using outcome-based guarantees to build trust in a skeptical market. The training incorporates these \"no-risk\" sales approaches, teaching trainees to measure and verify performance for customers.\n\n### Visualizing Hidden Benefits\n> \"Insulation doesn't just save energy—it extends AC life by reducing run-time.\" — BG\n\nTraining participants to identify and communicate secondary benefits is essential. We teach trainees to help customers see non-obvious benefits like equipment lifespan, air quality, illness reduction, and property value increases.\n\n### Creating New Market Niches\n> \"Insulation isn't a thing yet—prove the ROI and you open a whole new market.\" — BG\n\nRather than competing in crowded markets, we're preparing trainees to pioneer underserved niches. Dr. Nasih (DN) highlighted solar water heaters as a lower-cost entry point that builds trust for larger systems later, while Mustafa Waleed (MW) emphasized the market opportunity in proper battery installation and ventilation.\n\n### Real Clients, Real Projects\nFollowing Muayad's recommendation, capstone projects use trainees' own homes or real client briefs from partner companies. This creates immediate relevance while building portfolio pieces that demonstrate concrete skills.\n\n## 6. Implementation Insights\n\n### Equipment Requirements\n\nBased on our interviews, particularly with Mohammed Al-Qatan and Hussam Falih, we've determined the following minimum equipment needs for a 20-person cohort:\n\n- 4 complete solar systems (panels, inverters, batteries, controllers)\n- 4 roof/wall mounting practice rigs\n- 8 crimping tool sets and multimeters\n- Power meters for load assessment\n- IR thermometer for heat analysis\n- Shade analysis tools\n- Safety equipment for 20 participants\n\n### Cultural Adaptations\n\nMultiple trainers emphasized the need for culturally appropriate teaching methods:\n\n- **Post-meal activities**: Following Muayad's advice, schedule interactive activities after meals to maintain engagement\n- **Anonymous feedback**: Use sticky notes for questions to respect cultural sensitivity about admitting lack of knowledge\n- **Local success stories**: Incorporate examples from nearby neighborhoods to build credibility\n- **Amp-based calculations**: As Hussam noted, Iraqis think in amps, not kilowatt-hours—our worksheets start with amps and convert later\n\n### Certification and Credibility\n\nDr. Nasih suggested leveraging his RENAC license to co-brand certificates, increasing graduate credibility. We're exploring this partnership to strengthen the value of our program's completion certificates.\n\n## 7. Open Questions & Research Agenda\n\nSeveral critical questions emerged that require further investigation:\n\n1. **Women's Participation**: What specific strategies would encourage women's participation in the solar industry in Mosul?\n\n2. **Success Metrics**: What key performance indicators should measure the training program's success beyond placement rates?\n\n3. **Scaling Strategy**: What approach would be most effective for scaling this training to other regions of Iraq?\n\n4. **Equipment Specifications**: What exact equipment (brands, models, quantities) would be needed to set up an optimal training facility for 20 trainees?\n\n5. **Business Models**: What business models are most sustainable for solar installers in Mosul's current economic climate?\n\n6. **Remote Areas**: What modified approaches would be needed for training installers serving remote areas of Mosul province?\n\n## 8. Next Steps\n\n### Immediate Actions (Pre-Pilot)\n1. Secure a training venue with roof access for practical installations\n2. Develop the component \"failure wall\" with examples of incorrect installations\n3. Create price-sheet templates and gather current market data\n4. Establish MOUs with employer partners for Day 6 participation\n5. Collect real-world problem photos for the I-5 challenge activities\n\n### Medium-Term Actions (During Pilot)\n1. Document all \"aha moments\" from trainees for curriculum refinement\n2. Test the effectiveness of the mock interview format with employer feedback\n3. Measure hiring outcomes directly from the Day 6 industry jury\n4. Gather trainee feedback on the sales engineering approach\n\n### Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months)\n1. Develop the solar water heater micro-track as suggested by Dr. Nasih\n2. Create a formal alumni network with WhatsApp group and quarterly meetups\n3. Build a repository of local case studies and success stories\n4. Explore regional expansion based on Mosul pilot outcomes\n\n---\n\nThis training strategy represents a fundamental shift from traditional technical training. By building a community of practice, embedding market connections throughout, and emphasizing problem-solving over technology, we're creating a program that doesn't just teach skills—it transforms both trainees and the market they serve.\n\nOur next deliverable will include the detailed facilitation guide with day-by-day lesson plans, handouts, and assessment tools based on this strategic framework.",

Program Structure: The 6-Day Framework\n\nBased on our interviews and field testing, we've developed a 6-day structure that balances technical skills with market connection:\n\n| Day | Core Theme | Employer Touch-Point | Capstone Progress |\n|-----|------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Understand the Need – site audit, load in amps, empathy interview | Kick-off talk by local installer on market gaps | Teams choose a real client (cousin's house / firm brief) |\n| 2 | Components & Safety – inverter tear-down, DC vs AC, datasheets | Supplier pop-up booth, price booklet update | Bill of materials draft |\n| 3 | Design & Simulation – software, shade, ROI calculator | Live Q&A with finance / loan officer | Preliminary system + costings |\n| 4 | Mount & Wire – roof rig, torque checks, battery cooling box | Field visit to active install (partner firm) | Hands-on mock install & test |\n| 5 | Sales Engineering – guarantee scripts, objection handling | Employers sit in on sales-pitch rehearsals | Final design, pitch deck, ROI proof |\n| 6 | Prove & Connect – timed assembly, interviews, certificates | Industry Jury scores installs & hires grads | Capstone judged, offers / internships issued |\n\nThis structure directly implements Hussam's emphasis on practical skills, Mohammed's focus on visual learning, Saud's competition-based assessment, and Muayad's storytelling approach—all while creating multiple touchpoints with potential employers.\n\n## 3. Daily Workplan: Consistent Structure, Fresh Content\n\nOur daily structure creates a predictable rhythm that helps trainees know what to expect, while allowing for varied content:\n\n| Time Block | Activity | Invariant Element | Variable Element |\n|------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 09:00-09:30 | Recap & Kahoot | 5-question quiz on yesterday | New quiz content daily |\n| 09:30-11:00 | Skill Sprint | Hands-on station rotation | Component/topic changes |\n| 11:00-11:15 | Peer Teach-Back | 1 learner explains to group | Randomly assigned learner |\n| 11:15-12:30 | Scenario Lab | Small-team problem photo (I-5) | Fresh photo / fault each day |\n| 13:30-14:15 | Industry Moment | Guest or market data drop | Different guest / dataset |\n| 14:15-15:30 | Capstone Studio | Teams advance real project | Specific milestone per day |\n| 15:30-15:45 | Reflection Wall | Sticky-note \"aha\" & question | New colour notes per day |\n| 15:45-16:00 | Look-Ahead | Preview tomorrow & logistics | Adjust for field trips / roof use |\n\nThis format implements Muayad's sticky-note review method, Hussam's peer-teaching approach, and Mohammed's emphasis on visual learning. Notably, we've increased hands-on time to over 70% of the total program, directly addressing the unanimous recommendation from all trainers.\n\n## 4. Technical Innovations & Surprising Insights\n\nThrough our interviews, we uncovered several technical insights that aren't commonly taught but create significant value:\n\n### Heat Management as System Design\n> \"The most important part isn't the panel or the inverter; it's the box—heat kills efficiency.\" — BG\n\nMultiple trainers highlighted that installation failures in Mosul often stem from poor heat management. When batteries or inverters are placed in \"baytuna\" (stairwell enclosures), the greenhouse effect destroys efficiency and shortens component life. Our training includes IR thermometer testing and cooling box design.\n\n### Panel Shading as Passive Cooling\n> \"Panels shade the roof—pick the room you actually want to cool underneath them.\" — BG\n\nA surprising insight from field observations: solar panels provide significant shading to the roof beneath, reducing the cooling load for top-floor rooms. Our training now includes strategic panel placement to maximize this dual benefit.\n\n### Cleaning Technique Matters\n> \"You clean panels with lukewarm water, same temperature as the glass—tiny detail, huge impact.\" — BG\n\nImproper cleaning can damage panels or reduce output. The training includes specific maintenance procedures based on local conditions, addressing Hussam's emphasis on proper cleaning as culturally important for system reputation.\n\n### DC Safety is Non-Negotiable\nSaud Maan (SM) and Ali Abkan (AA) both emphasized the critical importance of DC circuit safety, which is often overlooked. We've dedicated a full 45-minute lab to DC vs. AC safety principles, showing the consequences of improper components through a \"failure wall\" of damaged equipment.\n\n## 5. Market Connection & Trust Building\n\n### Performance Guarantees\n> \"If your room isn't ten degrees cooler in three weeks, you don't pay—that guarantee wins trust.\" — BG\n\nWe discovered installers using outcome-based guarantees to build trust in a skeptical market. The training incorporates these \"no-risk\" sales approaches, teaching trainees to measure and verify performance for customers.\n\n### Visualizing Hidden Benefits\n> \"Insulation doesn't just save energy—it extends AC life by reducing run-time.\" — BG\n\nTraining participants to identify and communicate secondary benefits is essential. We teach trainees to help customers see non-obvious benefits like equipment lifespan, air quality, illness reduction, and property value increases.\n\n### Creating New Market Niches\n> \"Insulation isn't a thing yet—prove the ROI and you open a whole new market.\" — BG\n\nRather than competing in crowded markets, we're preparing trainees to pioneer underserved niches. Dr. Nasih (DN) highlighted solar water heaters as a lower-cost entry point that builds trust for larger systems later, while Mustafa Waleed (MW) emphasized the market opportunity in proper battery installation and ventilation.\n\n### Real Clients, Real Projects\nFollowing Muayad's recommendation, capstone projects use trainees' own homes or real client briefs from partner companies. This creates immediate relevance while building portfolio pieces that demonstrate concrete skills.\n\n## 6. Implementation Insights\n\n### Equipment Requirements\n\nBased on our interviews, particularly with Mohammed Al-Qatan and Hussam Falih, we've determined the following minimum equipment needs for a 20-person cohort:\n\n- 4 complete solar systems (panels, inverters, batteries, controllers)\n- 4 roof/wall mounting practice rigs\n- 8 crimping tool sets and multimeters\n- Power meters for load assessment\n- IR thermometer for heat analysis\n- Shade analysis tools\n- Safety equipment for 20 participants\n\n### Cultural Adaptations\n\nMultiple trainers emphasized the need for culturally appropriate teaching methods:\n\n- **Post-meal activities**: Following Muayad's advice, schedule interactive activities after meals to maintain engagement\n- **Anonymous feedback**: Use sticky notes for questions to respect cultural sensitivity about admitting lack of knowledge\n- **Local success stories**: Incorporate examples from nearby neighborhoods to build credibility\n- **Amp-based calculations**: As Hussam noted, Iraqis think in amps, not kilowatt-hours—our worksheets start with amps and convert later\n\n### Certification and Credibility\n\nDr. Nasih suggested leveraging his RENAC license to co-brand certificates, increasing graduate credibility. We're exploring this partnership to strengthen the value of our program's completion certificates.\n\n## 7. Open Questions & Research Agenda\n\nSeveral critical questions emerged that require further investigation:\n\n1. **Women's Participation**: What specific strategies would encourage women's participation in the solar industry in Mosul?\n\n2. **Success Metrics**: What key performance indicators should measure the training program's success beyond placement rates?\n\n3. **Scaling Strategy**: What approach would be most effective for scaling this training to other regions of Iraq?\n\n4. **Equipment Specifications**: What exact equipment (brands, models, quantities) would be needed to set up an optimal training facility for 20 trainees?\n\n5. **Business Models**: What business models are most sustainable for solar installers in Mosul's current economic climate?\n\n6. **Remote Areas**: What modified approaches would be needed for training installers serving remote areas of Mosul province?\n\n## 8. Next Steps\n\n### Immediate Actions (Pre-Pilot)\n1. Secure a training venue with roof access for practical installations\n2. Develop the component \"failure wall\" with examples of incorrect installations\n3. Create price-sheet templates and gather current market data\n4. Establish MOUs with employer partners for Day 6 participation\n5. Collect real-world problem photos for the I-5 challenge activities\n\n### Medium-Term Actions (During Pilot)\n1. Document all \"aha moments\" from trainees for curriculum refinement\n2. Test the effectiveness of the mock interview format with employer feedback\n3. Measure hiring outcomes directly from the Day 6 industry jury\n4. Gather trainee feedback on the sales engineering approach\n\n### Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months)\n1. Develop the solar water heater micro-track as suggested by Dr. Nasih\n2. Create a formal alumni network with WhatsApp group and quarterly meetups\n3. Build a repository of local case studies and success stories\n4. Explore regional expansion based on Mosul pilot outcomes\n\n---\n\nThis training strategy represents a fundamental shift from traditional technical training. By building a community of practice, embedding market connections throughout, and emphasizing problem-solving over technology, we're creating a program that doesn't just teach skills—it transforms both trainees and the market they serve.\n\nOur next deliverable will include the detailed facilitation guide with day-by-day lesson plans, handouts, and assessment tools based on this strategic framework.",

Through seven in-depth interviews with master trainers and extensive field observations, we've uncovered a fundamentally different approach: developing sales engineers who can translate between technical solutions and human needs.\n\nThis document outlines our training philosophy, program structure, and the key insights that make this approach uniquely effective for Mosul's context. We focus on equipping trainees with both technical expertise and the empathy needed to understand customer problems—creating market-makers who can open new niches in solar, insulation, and green architecture.\n\n## 1. Guiding Philosophy: Sales Engineering as Empathy\n\nOur interviews with trainers including Omar Laith, Muthanna Al Mashhadani, and others consistently revealed that successful solar professionals don't simply install technology—they solve human problems. This insight fundamentally shifts our approach from technical training to what we call \"sales engineering\"—being on the customer's side to find the right solution, even if that means recommending insulation instead of solar when that better serves their needs.\n\n### Sales Engineering & Problem-Solving\n\nThe biggest barriers to adoption aren't technical—they're perceptual. People don't see the problem clearly enough to value the solution. Our training develops sales engineers who help customers understand their needs before proposing technical solutions. This approach transforms \"selling\" from persuasion to genuine problem-solving, building trust in a skeptical market.\n\n### Market-Embedded Learning\n\nThe traditional model of \"train first, find jobs later\" consistently underperforms. Our approach embeds employers throughout the training process. Mohammed Ahmad Obadi and others specifically mentioned they would bring trainees to field sites and would immediately hire high-performers from the program. Mohammed Qatan and Dr. Nasih, both with strong industry connections, noted that seeing skills demonstrated in real time is more valuable than certificates.\n\n### Collaborative Growth Mindset\n\nSeveral trainers emphasized that the green building sector in Mosul needs market expansion, not more competition. We incorporate the Ubuntu concept (\"I am because we are\") and the \"rising tide lifts all boats\" philosophy—teaching solar installers, insulation specialists, and architects to see themselves as complementary parts of a sustainable building ecosystem rather than competitors.\n\n### Continuous Improvement Through Feedback\n\nThe program implements daily feedback loops—morning quizzes to assess retention and evening reflection walls to capture insights and improvement opportunities. This demonstrates the empathy-based approach we teach: listening, adapting, and improving based on real needs.\n\n## 2. Program Structure: The 6-Day Framework\n\nBased on our interviews with master trainers, we've developed a modular 6-day structure that balances technical skills with market connection:\n\n| Day | Core Focus | Key Activities | Capstone Progress |\n|-----|------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Understanding Needs | Site assessment, load calculation in amps, empathy interviews | Teams select real clients (family member's home or actual business) |\n| 2 | Components & Safety | Inverter examination, DC safety lab, datasheet literacy, market research | Initial system sizing and component selection |\n| 3 | System Design | Software simulation, shade analysis, ROI calculation, cooling solutions | Preliminary system design and cost estimation |\n| 4 | Installation Practice | Mounting techniques, wiring configurations, battery management | Mock installation and system testing |\n| 5 | Sales Engineering | Value proposition development, objection handling, performance guarantees | Final design with ROI analysis and sales presentation |\n| 6 | Industry Connection | System assembly competition, technical demonstrations, capstone presentations | Project presentations to industry representatives with potential job offers |\n\nThis structure implements Hussam's emphasis on practical skills, Mohammed's focus on visual learning, Saud's competition-based assessment, and Muayad's storytelling approach—all while creating multiple touchpoints with potential employers.\n\n## 3. Daily Structure: Engagement Through Practice\n\nOur daily framework creates a consistent rhythm while allowing for varied content:\n\n| Time Block | Activity | Purpose | Facilitation Notes |\n|------------|----------|---------|-------------------|\n| 09:00-09:30 | Knowledge Check | Assess retention and reinforce previous day's learning through interactive Kahoot quiz | Important for M&E; provides quantitative learning data |\n| 09:30-11:00 | Hands-on Skills | Build practical competence through station-based rotation | Maintains >70% practical time as recommended by all trainers |\n| 11:00-11:15 | Peer Teaching | Develop explanation skills and reinforce concepts | Builds confidence and communication abilities essential for sales engineering |\n| 11:15-12:30 | Problem Scenarios | Develop troubleshooting skills through case-based team competition | Uses the \"I-5\" approach (identify problems in photos/scenarios) |\n| 13:30-15:30 | Capstone Work | Apply learning to real-world projects with coaching | Projects based on actual homes or businesses |\n| 15:30-15:45 | Reflection Wall | Capture insights and questions for continuous improvement | Adapts Muayad's sticky-note method |\n| 15:45-16:00 | Integration | Connect day's learning to larger context and preview next steps | Builds coherent understanding across the program |\n\nThis structure begins with engagement to reduce passivity, incorporates peer learning for communication skills, and emphasizes practical application to real problems. The extended capstone time allows for deeper engagement with actual projects, recognizing that arranging daily industry moments might be challenging.\n\n## 4. Curriculum Adjustments: Insights from Master Trainers\n\nOur interviews revealed several critical insights that aren't commonly taught but create significant value in Mosul's context:\n\n### Heat Management as System Design\n\nMultiple trainers highlighted that installation failures in Mosul often stem from poor heat management. When batteries or inverters are placed in \"baytuna\" (stairwell enclosures), the greenhouse effect destroys efficiency and shortens component life. Our training includes IR thermometer testing and cooling box design.\n\n### Panel Placement for Dual Benefits\n\nA surprising field observation revealed that solar panels provide significant shading to the roof beneath, reducing cooling loads for top-floor rooms. Our training now includes strategic panel placement to maximize both electricity generation and passive cooling benefits.\n\n### DC Safety Principles\n\nSaud Maan and Ali Abkan both emphasized the critical importance of DC circuit safety, which is often overlooked. We've dedicated a full session to DC vs. AC safety principles, showing the consequences of improper components through a \"failure wall\" of damaged equipment.\n\n### Maintenance and Cleaning Protocols\n\nSeveral trainers emphasized that proper maintenance procedures are frequently neglected. The training includes specific cleaning techniques (using lukewarm water at the same temperature as the glass) and maintenance schedules tailored to Mosul's dusty conditions.\n\n### Solar Water Heaters as Market Entry\n\nDr. Nasih highlighted that solar water heaters require only 1-3 days of training and provide an excellent \"foot in the door\" offering. These simpler systems build customer trust while allowing new technicians to develop skills and establish their businesses with lower initial investment.\n\n## 5. Market Development Strategies\n\n### Performance Guarantees\n\nField observations revealed installers using outcome-based guarantees like \"If your room isn't 10 degrees cooler in three weeks, you don't pay.\" The training incorporates these trust-building approaches, teaching trainees to measure and verify performance for skeptical customers.\n\n### Visualizing Hidden Benefits\n\nTraining participants to identify and communicate secondary benefits is essential. These include extended equipment lifespan (reduced AC runtime with insulation), improved air quality, reduced illness from proper window orientation, and increased property values—benefits that aren't immediately obvious but significantly enhance the value proposition.\n\n### Creating New Market Niches\n\nRather than competing in crowded markets, we're preparing trainees to pioneer underserved niches. Dr. Nasih highlighted solar water heaters as a lower-cost entry point, while Mustafa Waleed emphasized the market opportunity in proper battery installation and ventilation systems.\n\n### Quality Assurance and Follow-up\n\nDr. Nasih identified a significant gap in quality assurance and maintenance services. The training includes developing maintenance plans and follow-up protocols that create ongoing customer relationships and revenue streams.\n\n## 6. Implementation Recommendations\n\nBased on trainer interviews and field observations, we recommend the following implementation strategies:\n\n### Equipment and Resources\n\n1. **Tool Library**: Establish a borrowing system for specialized tools that individual technicians may not need to purchase immediately.\n\n2. **Material Library**: Create a physical display of component options (panels, inverters, batteries) with comparisons and quality indicators.\n\n3. **Testing Rig**: Develop a demonstration unit for battery box cooling solutions and heat management techniques.\n\n4. **Failure Wall**: Collect examples of failed installations, damaged components, and common mistakes for training purposes.\n\n### Teaching Methods\n\n1. **Flipped Classroom Approach**: Present problems first, allow trainees to develop solutions, then provide expert guidance—building problem-solving skills rather than rote knowledge.\n\n2. **Role-playing Scenarios**: Incorporate customer personas with specific objections and concerns for sales engineering practice.\n\n3. **Competitive Challenges**: Implement timed assembly competitions and troubleshooting races as Saud Maan recommended.\n\n4. **Visual Learning Priority**: Follow Mohammed's emphasis on demonstration over lecturing, with minimal note-taking.\n\n### Community Building\n\n1. **Green Festival**: Host an end-of-program showcase where trainees present their projects to potential employers, clients, and the broader community.\n\n2. **Alumni Network**: Establish quarterly meetups and a communication platform for graduates to share opportunities and technical support.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Dinner**: Bring together trainees, trainers, industry representatives, and even project clients for relationship-building beyond the formal program.\n\n## 7. Open Questions and Research Agenda\n\nSeveral critical questions emerged that require further investigation:\n\n1. **Solar Water Heating Relevance**: How suitable are solar water heaters for Mosul's climate and typical household needs?\n\n2. **Community Attitude Shift**: What strategies can effectively change broader community perceptions about green building approaches?\n\n3. **Women's Participation**: What specific methods would encourage and support women's participation in the solar industry?\n\n4. **Certification Value**: What certificate format and endorsements would maximize graduate credibility with employers?\n\n5. **Quality Assurance Standards**: What local standards should be established for installation quality and system performance?\n\n6. **Collaborative Market Development**: How can we foster cooperation rather than competition among green building professionals?\n\n## 8. Next Steps\n\n### Immediate Actions (Pre-Pilot)\n1. Develop detailed materials list with specifications and quantities\n2. Create a repository of case studies and problem scenarios from trainer interviews\n3. Design a certificate format with industry validation\n4. Establish MOUs with firms willing to host site visits and consider hiring graduates\n5. Develop the Kahoot quizzes for daily assessment and M&E purposes\n\n### Medium-Term Actions (During Pilot)\n1. Document all insights from daily reflection walls for curriculum refinement\n2. Test the effectiveness of the sales engineering approach through customer role-plays\n3. Measure hiring outcomes directly from the Day 6 industry presentations\n4. Gather trainee feedback on the balance of technical vs. communication skills\n\n### Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months)\n1. Develop the solar water heater micro-track as suggested by Dr. Nasih\n2. Formalize the alumni network with scheduled activities and support systems\n3. Expand the \"failure wall\" with documentation of common installation problems\n4. Explore regional expansion based on Mosul pilot outcomes\n5. Create a comprehensive market guide with component prices, supplier information, and ROI calculators\n\n---\n\nThis training strategy represents a fundamental shift in technical training for Mosul. By focusing on sales engineering—understanding and solving customer problems rather than simply installing technology—we're creating a program that develops both technical expertise and market-building skills. The emphasis on empathy, collaborative growth, and solving real-world problems positions graduates to not just find jobs but to transform Mosul's green building ecosystem.\n\nOur next deliverable will include the detailed facilitation guide with day-by-day lesson plans, handouts, and assessment tools based on this strategic framework.",

            "text": "# From Wires to Work: Insight-Driven Solar Training Strategy for Mosul\n\n**Final Draft: Output 1 Deliverable 1**\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe solar training program developed for Mosul transcends traditional technical instruction by creating a transformative experience for both trainees and the local market. Through seven in-depth interviews with master trainers and extensive field observations, we've uncovered a fundamentally different approach: developing sales engineers who can translate between technical solutions and human needs.\n\nThis document outlines our training philosophy, program structure, and the key insights that make this approach uniquely effective for Mosul's context. We focus on equipping trainees with both technical expertise and the empathy needed to understand customer problems—creating market-makers who can open new niches in solar, insulation, and green architecture.\n\n## 1. Guiding Philosophy: Sales Engineering as Empathy\n\nOur interviews with trainers including Omar Laith, Muthanna Al Mashhadani, and others consistently revealed that successful solar professionals don't simply install technology—they solve human problems. This insight fundamentally shifts our approach from technical training to what we call \"sales engineering\"—being on the customer's side to find the right solution, even if that means recommending insulation instead of solar when that better serves their needs.\n\n### Sales Engineering & Problem-Solving\n\nThe biggest barriers to adoption aren't technical—they're perceptual. People don't see the problem clearly enough to value the solution. Our training develops sales engineers who help customers understand their needs before proposing technical solutions. This approach transforms \"selling\" from persuasion to genuine problem-solving, building trust in a skeptical market.\n\n### Market-Embedded Learning\n\nThe traditional model of \"train first, find jobs later\" consistently underperforms. Our approach embeds employers throughout the training process. Mohammed Ahmad Obadi and others specifically mentioned they would bring trainees to field sites and would immediately hire high-performers from the program. Mohammed Qatan and Dr. Nasih, both with strong industry connections, noted that seeing skills demonstrated in real time is more valuable than certificates.\n\n### Collaborative Growth Mindset\n\nSeveral trainers emphasized that the green building sector in Mosul needs market expansion, not more competition. We incorporate the Ubuntu concept (\"I am because we are\") and the \"rising tide lifts all boats\" philosophy—teaching solar installers, insulation specialists, and architects to see themselves as complementary parts of a sustainable building ecosystem rather than competitors.\n\n### Continuous Improvement Through Feedback\n\nThe program implements daily feedback loops—morning quizzes to assess retention and evening reflection walls to capture insights and improvement opportunities. This demonstrates the empathy-based approach we teach: listening, adapting, and improving based on real needs.\n\n## 2. Program Structure: The 6-Day Framework\n\nBased on our interviews with master trainers, we've developed a modular 6-day structure that balances technical skills with market connection:\n\n| Day | Core Focus | Key Activities | Capstone Progress |\n|-----|------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Understanding Needs | Site assessment, load calculation in amps, empathy interviews | Teams select real clients (family member's home or actual business) |\n| 2 | Components & Safety | Inverter examination, DC safety lab, datasheet literacy, market research | Initial system sizing and component selection |\n| 3 | System Design | Software simulation, shade analysis, ROI calculation, cooling solutions | Preliminary system design and cost estimation |\n| 4 | Installation Practice | Mounting techniques, wiring configurations, battery management | Mock installation and system testing |\n| 5 | Sales Engineering | Value proposition development, objection handling, performance guarantees | Final design with ROI analysis and sales presentation |\n| 6 | Industry Connection | System assembly competition, technical demonstrations, capstone presentations | Project presentations to industry representatives with potential job offers |\n\nThis structure implements Hussam's emphasis on practical skills, Mohammed's focus on visual learning, Saud's competition-based assessment, and Muayad's storytelling approach—all while creating multiple touchpoints with potential employers.\n\n## 3. Daily Structure: Engagement Through Practice\n\nOur daily framework creates a consistent rhythm while allowing for varied content:\n\n| Time Block | Activity | Purpose | Facilitation Notes |\n|------------|----------|---------|-------------------|\n| 09:00-09:30 | Knowledge Check | Assess retention and reinforce previous day's learning through interactive Kahoot quiz | Important for M&E; provides quantitative learning data |\n| 09:30-11:00 | Hands-on Skills | Build practical competence through station-based rotation | Maintains >70% practical time as recommended by all trainers |\n| 11:00-11:15 | Peer Teaching | Develop explanation skills and reinforce concepts | Builds confidence and communication abilities essential for sales engineering |\n| 11:15-12:30 | Problem Scenarios | Develop troubleshooting skills through case-based team competition | Uses the \"I-5\" approach (identify problems in photos/scenarios) |\n| 13:30-15:30 | Capstone Work | Apply learning to real-world projects with coaching | Projects based on actual homes or businesses |\n| 15:30-15:45 | Reflection Wall | Capture insights and questions for continuous improvement | Adapts Muayad's sticky-note method |\n| 15:45-16:00 | Integration | Connect day's learning to larger context and preview next steps | Builds coherent understanding across the program |\n\nThis structure begins with engagement to reduce passivity, incorporates peer learning for communication skills, and emphasizes practical application to real problems. The extended capstone time allows for deeper engagement with actual projects, recognizing that arranging daily industry moments might be challenging.\n\n## 4. Curriculum Adjustments: Insights from Master Trainers\n\nOur interviews revealed several critical insights that aren't commonly taught but create significant value in Mosul's context:\n\n### Heat Management as System Design\n\nMultiple trainers highlighted that installation failures in Mosul often stem from poor heat management. When batteries or inverters are placed in \"baytuna\" (stairwell enclosures), the greenhouse effect destroys efficiency and shortens component life. Our training includes IR thermometer testing and cooling box design.\n\n### Panel Placement for Dual Benefits\n\nA surprising field observation revealed that solar panels provide significant shading to the roof beneath, reducing cooling loads for top-floor rooms. Our training now includes strategic panel placement to maximize both electricity generation and passive cooling benefits.\n\n### DC Safety Principles\n\nSaud Maan and Ali Abkan both emphasized the critical importance of DC circuit safety, which is often overlooked. We've dedicated a full session to DC vs. AC safety principles, showing the consequences of improper components through a \"failure wall\" of damaged equipment.\n\n### Maintenance and Cleaning Protocols\n\nSeveral trainers emphasized that proper maintenance procedures are frequently neglected. The training includes specific cleaning techniques (using lukewarm water at the same temperature as the glass) and maintenance schedules tailored to Mosul's dusty conditions.\n\n### Solar Water Heaters as Market Entry\n\nDr. Nasih highlighted that solar water heaters require only 1-3 days of training and provide an excellent \"foot in the door\" offering. These simpler systems build customer trust while allowing new technicians to develop skills and establish their businesses with lower initial investment.\n\n## 5. Market Development Strategies\n\n### Performance Guarantees\n\nField observations revealed installers using outcome-based guarantees like \"If your room isn't 10 degrees cooler in three weeks, you don't pay.\" The training incorporates these trust-building approaches, teaching trainees to measure and verify performance for skeptical customers.\n\n### Visualizing Hidden Benefits\n\nTraining participants to identify and communicate secondary benefits is essential. These include extended equipment lifespan (reduced AC runtime with insulation), improved air quality, reduced illness from proper window orientation, and increased property values—benefits that aren't immediately obvious but significantly enhance the value proposition.\n\n### Creating New Market Niches\n\nRather than competing in crowded markets, we're preparing trainees to pioneer underserved niches. Dr. Nasih highlighted solar water heaters as a lower-cost entry point, while Mustafa Waleed emphasized the market opportunity in proper battery installation and ventilation systems.\n\n### Quality Assurance and Follow-up\n\nDr. Nasih identified a significant gap in quality assurance and maintenance services. The training includes developing maintenance plans and follow-up protocols that create ongoing customer relationships and revenue streams.\n\n## 6. Implementation Recommendations\n\nBased on trainer interviews and field observations, we recommend the following implementation strategies:\n\n### Equipment and Resources\n\n1. **Tool Library**: Establish a borrowing system for specialized tools that individual technicians may not need to purchase immediately.\n\n2. **Material Library**: Create a physical display of component options (panels, inverters, batteries) with comparisons and quality indicators.\n\n3. **Testing Rig**: Develop a demonstration unit for battery box cooling solutions and heat management techniques.\n\n4. **Failure Wall**: Collect examples of failed installations, damaged components, and common mistakes for training purposes.\n\n### Teaching Methods\n\n1. **Flipped Classroom Approach**: Present problems first, allow trainees to develop solutions, then provide expert guidance—building problem-solving skills rather than rote knowledge.\n\n2. **Role-playing Scenarios**: Incorporate customer personas with specific objections and concerns for sales engineering practice.\n\n3. **Competitive Challenges**: Implement timed assembly competitions and troubleshooting races as Saud Maan recommended.\n\n4. **Visual Learning Priority**: Follow Mohammed's emphasis on demonstration over lecturing, with minimal note-taking.\n\n### Community Building\n\n1. **Green Festival**: Host an end-of-program showcase where trainees present their projects to potential employers, clients, and the broader community.\n\n2. **Alumni Network**: Establish quarterly meetups and a communication platform for graduates to share opportunities and technical support.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Dinner**: Bring together trainees, trainers, industry representatives, and even project clients for relationship-building beyond the formal program.\n\n## 7. Open Questions and Research Agenda\n\nSeveral critical questions emerged that require further investigation:\n\n1. **Solar Water Heating Relevance**: How suitable are solar water heaters for Mosul's climate and typical household needs?\n\n2. **Community Attitude Shift**: What strategies can effectively change broader community perceptions about green building approaches?\n\n3. **Women's Participation**: What specific methods would encourage and support women's participation in the solar industry?\n\n4. **Certification Value**: What certificate format and endorsements would maximize graduate credibility with employers?\n\n5. **Quality Assurance Standards**: What local standards should be established for installation quality and system performance?\n\n6. **Collaborative Market Development**: How can we foster cooperation rather than competition among green building professionals?\n\n## 8.

The evidence suggests that successful solar professionals in Mosul must develop both technical expertise and the ability to understand customer problems—what we've come to describe as \"sales engineering.\"\n\nThis document outlines a training approach informed by the practical experience of local experts, highlighting the importance of empathy, hands-on learning, and real-world problem-solving in preparing trainees for Mosul's unique market conditions.\n\n## 1. Methodology\n\nOur approach involved in-depth interviews with seven master trainers and extensive field observations, including:\n- Hussam Falih (HF): Expert in market research and peer teaching\n- Saud Maan (SM): Developer of competition-based assessment methods\n- Mohammed Al-Qatan (MQ): Visual learning specialist and industry connection expert\n- Ali Abkan (AA): Component quality assessment specialist\n- Muayad Hasan (MH): Software simulation and storytelling techniques expert\n- Dr. Nasih (DN): RENAC-certified trainer with solar water heater expertise\n- Mustafa Waleed (MW): Battery systems and market development specialist\n- Omar Laith (OL): Emphasis on customer empathy and needs assessment\n- Muthanna Al Mashhadani (MM): Sales technique and trust-building expert\n\nWe used rapid-coding to identify recurring themes and unique insights, then clustered these into actionable program elements.\n\n## 2. Sales Engineering: Learning from Trainer Experience\n\nMultiple trainers emphasized that successful solar professionals in Mosul don't lead with technology—they start by understanding customer problems. As Muthanna Al Mashhadani explained, \"When customers understand their problem, the solution sells itself\" (MM). This insight has shaped our concept of \"sales engineering\"—being on the customer's side to find the right solution, even if that means recommending a different approach than initially expected.\n\n### Understanding Before Selling\n\nOmar Laith emphasized that \"before you talk watts and volts, you must understand what keeps the customer up at night\" (OL). Our training adopts this principle by teaching trainees to conduct thorough needs assessments before proposing technical solutions.\n\n### Building Trust Through Guarantees\n\nWe observed installers in the field using outcome-based guarantees to build trust: \"If your room isn't 10 degrees cooler in three weeks, you don't pay.\" This approach, witnessed during field observations, transforms skeptical prospects into confident customers. The training incorporates these trust-building techniques based on real market practices in Mosul.\n\n### Market Connection Through Demonstration\n\nMohammed Al-Qatan noted that \"real interviews. Because in the end, the experience will teach them\" (MQ). Similarly, Mohammed Ahmad Obadi stated he would \"bring trainees to field sites\" and \"immediately hire high-performers\" from the program. This direct evidence suggests that seeing skills demonstrated in real time is more valuable to employers than certificates alone.\n\n## 3. Stakeholder Ecosystem\n\nOur interviews revealed a complex ecosystem of stakeholders that the training program must engage. Each group has specific interests and needs that our program design addresses:\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n\n\nThis stakeholder mapping reveals both opportunities and potential challenges. High-leverage actors include equipment suppliers (MW) who offer free panels for demonstration installations and government loan programs that can help graduates establish businesses. However, gaps remain in formal banking partnerships and consistent employer engagement that will need to be addressed during implementation.\n\n## 4. Program Structure: Evidence-Based 6-Day Framework\n\nBased on our interviews with master trainers, we've developed a 6-day structure that balances technical skills with market connection:\n\n| Day | Core Focus | Key Activities | Evidence Base |\n|-----|------------|----------------|--------------|\n| 1 | Understanding Needs | Site assessment, load calculation in amps, empathy interviews | \"Iraqis speak in amps, not kWh\" (HF); Customer interviews (MH) |\n| 2 | Components & Safety | Inverter examination, DC safety lab, datasheet literacy, market research | \"DC is not as forgiving as AC\" (SM); \"The most important thing is the datasheet\" (AA) |\n| 3 | System Design | Software simulation, shade analysis, ROI calculation, cooling solutions | Software tools (MH); Heat management (MW) |\n| 4 | Installation Practice | Mounting techniques, wiring configurations, battery management | \"I've seen panels that move with the wind\" (MQ); Panel fixing (HF) |\n| 5 | Sales Engineering | Value proposition development, objection handling, performance guarantees | \"Run the numbers so people see why 'expensive' is cheaper\" (AA) |\n| 6 | Industry Connection | System assembly competition, technical demonstrations, capstone presentations | \"Real interviews... experience will teach them\" (MQ) |\n\nThis structure implements the 70% practical emphasis that all trainers recommended. As Mohammed Al-Qatan emphasized, \"We have nothing called theory; we are all practical work\" (MQ). The framework provides multiple touchpoints for trainees to engage with real-world problems and potential employers.\n\n## 5. Daily Structure: Engagement Through Practice\n\nBased on trainer recommendations, we've created a daily framework that focuses on engagement and practical application:\n\n| Time Block | Activity | Purpose | Evidence Base |\n|------------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| 09:00-09:30 | Knowledge Check | Interactive Kahoot quiz to assess retention | Recommended by MW for M&E purposes |\n| 09:30-11:00 | Hands-on Skills | Station-based rotation through practical activities | >70% practical time (all trainers) |\n| 11:00-11:15 | Peer Teaching | Trainees teach each other key concepts | Micro-teaching approach (HF) |\n| 11:15-12:30 | Problem Scenarios | Team-based troubleshooting of case examples | Problem-solving scenarios (SM) |\n| 13:30-15:30 | Capstone Work | Apply learning to real-world projects | \"Each person designs a complete system from A to Z\" (HF) |\n| 15:30-15:45 | Reflection Wall | Capture insights and questions | Daily sticky-note method (MH) |\n| 15:45-16:00 | Integration | Connect day's learning to larger context | Recommended in multiple interviews |\n\nThis structure incorporates Muayad's reflection wall technique, Hussam's peer-teaching approach, and Mohammed's visual learning emphasis, while maintaining the 70% practical time that all trainers stressed was essential.\n\n## 6. Technical Insights: Lessons from the Field\n\nOur interviews revealed several critical insights that aren't commonly taught but create significant value in Mosul's context:\n\n### Heat Management as System Design\n\nMultiple trainers highlighted installation failures stemming from poor heat management. Mustafa Waleed explained how batteries placed in \"baytuna\" (stairwell enclosures) suffer from a greenhouse effect that destroys efficiency and shortens component life (MW). The training includes IR thermometer testing and cooling box design based on these field observations.\n\n### Mounting Failures and Wind Damage\n\nMohammed Al-Qatan shared alarming examples: \"I've seen panels that move, meaning the entire rack moves with the wind\" (MQ). This insight has led to dedicated sessions on proper mounting techniques and structural calculations. Hussam Falih similarly emphasized the importance of proper mounting hardware and installation techniques to prevent these dangerous failures (HF).\n\n### Wiring Shortcuts and Safety Risks\n\nAli Abkan shared a cautionary tale of an installer who connected two panels to one side of an inverter to save on crimping connectors (AA). This shortcut led to system failure and potential fire risk. The training now includes a \"failure wall\" of examples showing the consequences of such shortcuts.\n\n### Cleaning and Maintenance Protocols\n\nSeveral trainers emphasized that proper maintenance is frequently neglected. As noted in field observations, \"You clean panels with lukewarm water, same temperature as the glass—tiny detail, huge impact.\" This attention to maintenance details is incorporated throughout the training.\n\n## 7. Market Development Insights\n\n### The \"Ubuntu\" Approach to Market Creation\n\nSeveral trainers emphasized that the green building sector in Mosul needs market expansion, not more competition. As Saud Maan noted, \"We need to grow the pie, not fight over slices\" (SM). This aligns with the Ubuntu philosophy (\"I am because we are\") and the \"rising tide lifts all boats\" approach—teaching solar installers, insulation specialists, and architects to see themselves as complementary parts of a sustainable building ecosystem.\n\n### Solar Water Heaters as Market Entry\n\nDr. Nasih highlighted that solar water heaters require only 1-3 days of training and provide an excellent \"foot in the door\" offering (DN). These simpler systems build customer trust while allowing new technicians to develop skills with lower initial investment.\n\n### Insulation as an Untapped Opportunity\n\nField observations revealed significant potential in the insulation market: \"Insulation isn't a thing yet—prove the ROI and you open a whole new market.\" Several trainers noted that insulation not only reduces energy costs but extends equipment lifespan by reducing AC runtime—a benefit that few customers currently understand.\n\n### Quality Assurance and Follow-up\n\nDr. Nasih identified a significant gap in quality assurance and maintenance services (DN). The training includes developing maintenance plans and follow-up protocols that create ongoing customer relationships and revenue streams.\n\n## 8. Implementation Recommendations\n\nBased on trainer interviews and field observations, we recommend the following implementation strategies:\n\n### Equipment and Resources\n\n1. **Tool Library**: Establish a borrowing system for specialized tools, as recommended by multiple trainers concerned about initial equipment costs.\n\n2. **Material Library**: Create physical displays of component options with quality comparisons, implementing Ali Abkan's approach to quality assessment (AA).\n\n3. **Testing Rig**: Develop a demonstration unit for battery box cooling solutions based on Mustafa Waleed's insights on heat management (MW).\n\n4. **Failure Wall**: Collect examples of failed installations as recommended by Mohammed Al-Qatan and others (MQ).\n\n### Teaching Methods\n\n1. **Flipped Classroom Approach**: Present problems first, allow trainees to develop solutions, then provide expert guidance—as practiced by Saud Maan (SM).\n\n2. **Role-playing Scenarios**: Incorporate customer personas with specific objections for sales practice, following Muthanna Al Mashhadani's approach (MM).\n\n3. **Competitive Challenges**: Implement timed assembly competitions as Saud Maan recommended (SM).\n\n4. **Visual Learning Priority**: Follow Mohammed's emphasis on demonstration over lecturing (MQ).\n\n### Community Building\n\n1. **Green Festival**: Host an end-of-program showcase where trainees present their projects, implementing Saud's idea for connecting with employers (SM).\n\n2. **Alumni Network**: Establish regular meetups based on Dr. Nasih's observation of continued alumni relationships (DN).\n\n3. **Ecosystem Dinner**: Bring together all stakeholders for relationship-building beyond the formal program.\n\n## 9. Open Questions and Research Agenda\n\nSeveral critical questions emerged that require further investigation:\n\n1. **Solar Water Heating Relevance**: How suitable are solar water heaters for Mosul's climate and typical household needs?\n\n2. **Community Attitude Shift**: What strategies can effectively change broader community perceptions about green building approaches?\n\n3. **Women's Participation**: What specific methods would encourage and support women's participation in the solar industry?\n\n4. **Certification Value**: What certificate format and endorsements would maximize graduate credibility with employers?\n\n5. **Quality Assurance Standards**: What local standards should be established for installation quality and system performance?\n\n6. **Collaborative Market Development**: How can we better foster cooperation rather than competition among green building professionals?\n\n## 10. Next Steps\n\n### Immediate Actions (Pre-Pilot)\n1. Develop detailed materials list with specifications and quantities\n2. Create a repository of case studies from trainer interviews\n3. Design a certificate format with industry validation\n4. Establish MOUs with firms willing to host site visits\n5. Develop the daily assessment quizzes for M&E purposes\n\n### Medium-Term Actions (During Pilot)\n1. Document insights from daily reflection walls\n2. Test the effectiveness of the sales engineering approach\n3. Measure hiring outcomes from industry presentations\n4. Gather trainee feedback on technical vs. communication skills\n\n### Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months)\n1. Develop the solar water heater micro-track (DN)\n2. Formalize the alumni network with scheduled activities\n3. Expand the \"failure wall\" documentation\n4. Explore regional expansion based on pilot outcomes\n5. Create a comprehensive market guide with component prices\n\n---\n\nThis training approach represents a synthesis of insights from experienced local trainers. By focusing on \"sales engineering\"—understanding and solving customer problems rather than simply installing technology—we aim to develop both technical expertise and market-building skills. Our evidence suggests that emphasizing empathy, hands-on learning, and real-world problem-solving will better prepare trainees for success in Mosul's unique market conditions.\n\nOur next deliverable will include the detailed facilitation guide with day-by-day lesson plans, handouts, and assessment tools based on this strategic framework.",

            "text": "\n\nThis stakeholder mapping reveals both opportunities and potential challenges. High-leverage actors include equipment suppliers (MW) who offer free panels for demonstration installations and government loan programs that can help graduates establish businesses. However, gaps remain in formal banking partnerships and consistent employer engagement that will need to be addressed during implementation.\n\n## 4. Program Structure: Evidence-Based 6-Day Framework\n\nBased on our interviews with master trainers, we've developed a 6-day structure that balances technical skills with market connection:\n\n| Day | Core Focus | Key Activities | Evidence Base |\n|-----|------------|----------------|--------------|\n| 1 | Understanding Needs | Site assessment, load calculation in amps, empathy interviews | \"Iraqis speak in amps, not kWh\" (HF); Customer interviews (MH) |\n| 2 | Components & Safety | Inverter examination, DC safety lab, datasheet literacy, market research | \"DC is not as forgiving as AC\" (SM); \"The most important thing is the datasheet\" (AA) |\n| 3 | System Design | Software simulation, shade analysis, ROI calculation, cooling solutions | Software tools (MH); Heat management (MW) |\n| 4 | Installation Practice | Mounting techniques, wiring configurations, battery management | \"I've seen panels that move with the wind\" (MQ); Panel fixing (HF) |\n| 5 | Sales Engineering | Value proposition development, objection handling, performance guarantees | \"Run the numbers so people see why 'expensive' is cheaper\" (AA) |\n| 6 | Industry Connection | System assembly competition, technical demonstrations, capstone presentations | \"Real interviews... experience will teach them\" (MQ) |\n\nThis structure implements the 70% practical emphasis that all trainers recommended. As Mohammed Al-Qatan emphasized, \"We have nothing called theory; we are all practical work\" (MQ). The framework provides multiple touchpoints for trainees to engage with real-world problems and potential employers.\n\n## 5. Daily Structure: Engagement Through Practice\n\nBased on trainer recommendations, we've created a daily framework that focuses on engagement and practical application:\n\n| Time Block | Activity | Purpose | Evidence Base |\n|------------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| 09:00-09:30 | Knowledge Check | Interactive Kahoot quiz to assess retention | Recommended by MW for M&E purposes |\n| 09:30-11:00 | Hands-on Skills | Station-based rotation through practical activities | >70% practical time (all trainers) |\n| 11:00-11:15 | Peer Teaching | Trainees teach each other key concepts | Micro-teaching approach (HF) |\n| 11:15-12:30 | Problem Scenarios | Team-based troubleshooting of case examples | Problem-solving scenarios (SM) |\n| 13:30-15:30 | Capstone Work | Apply learning to real-world projects | \"Each person designs a complete system from A to Z\" (HF) |\n| 15:30-15:45 | Reflection Wall | Capture insights and questions | Daily sticky-note method (MH) |\n| 15:45-16:00 | Integration | Connect day's learning to larger context | Recommended in multiple interviews |\n\nThis structure incorporates Muayad's reflection wall technique, Hussam's peer-teaching approach, and Mohammed's visual learning emphasis, while maintaining the 70% practical time that all trainers stressed was essential.\n\n## 6. Technical Insights: Lessons from the Field\n\nOur interviews revealed several critical insights that aren't commonly taught but create significant value in Mosul's context:\n\n### Heat Management as System Design\n\nMultiple trainers highlighted installation failures stemming from poor heat management. Mustafa Waleed explained how batteries placed in \"baytuna\" (stairwell enclosures) suffer from a greenhouse effect that destroys efficiency and shortens component life (MW). The training includes IR thermometer testing and cooling box design based on these field observations.\n\n### Mounting Failures and Wind Damage\n\nMohammed Al-Qatan shared alarming examples: \"I've seen panels that move, meaning the entire rack moves with the wind\" (MQ). This insight has led to dedicated sessions on proper mounting techniques and structural calculations. Hussam Falih similarly emphasized the importance of proper mounting hardware and installation techniques to prevent these dangerous failures (HF).\n\n### Wiring Shortcuts and Safety Risks\n\nAli Abkan shared a cautionary tale of an installer who connected two panels to one side of an inverter to save on crimping connectors (AA). This shortcut led to system failure and potential fire risk. The training now includes a \"failure wall\" of examples showing the consequences of such shortcuts.\n\n### Cleaning and Maintenance Protocols\n\nSeveral trainers emphasized that proper maintenance is frequently neglected. As noted in field observations, \"You clean panels with lukewarm water, same temperature as the glass—tiny detail, huge impact.\" This attention to maintenance details is incorporated throughout the training.\n\n## 7. Market Development Insights\n\n### The \"Ubuntu\" Approach to Market Creation\n\nSeveral trainers emphasized that the green building sector in Mosul needs market expansion, not more competition. As Saud Maan noted, \"We need to grow the pie, not fight over slices\" (SM). This aligns with the Ubuntu philosophy (\"I am because we are\") and the \"rising tide lifts all boats\" approach—teaching solar installers, insulation specialists, and architects to see themselves as complementary parts of a sustainable building ecosystem.\n\n### Solar Water Heaters as Market Entry\n\nDr. Nasih highlighted that solar water heaters require only 1-3 days of training and provide an excellent \"foot in the door\" offering (DN). These simpler systems build customer trust while allowing new technicians to develop skills with lower initial investment.\n\n### Insulation as an Untapped Opportunity\n\nField observations revealed significant potential in the insulation market: \"Insulation isn't a thing yet—prove the ROI and you open a whole new market.\" Several trainers noted that insulation not only reduces energy costs but extends equipment lifespan by reducing AC runtime—a benefit that few customers currently understand.\n\n### Quality Assurance and Follow-up\n\nDr. Nasih identified a significant gap in quality assurance and maintenance services (DN). The training includes developing maintenance plans and follow-up protocols that create ongoing customer relationships and revenue streams.\n\n## 8. Implementation Recommendations\n\nBased on trainer interviews and field observations, we recommend the following implementation strategies:\n\n### Equipment and Resources\n\n1. **Tool Library**: Establish a borrowing system for specialized tools, as recommended by multiple trainers concerned about initial equipment costs.\n\n2. **Material Library**: Create physical displays of component options with quality comparisons, implementing Ali Abkan's approach to quality assessment (AA).\n\n3. **Testing Rig**: Develop a demonstration unit for battery box cooling solutions based on Mustafa Waleed's insights on heat management (MW).\n\n4. **Failure Wall**: Collect examples of failed installations as recommended by Mohammed Al-Qatan and others (MQ).\n\n### Teaching Methods\n\n1. **Flipped Classroom Approach**: Present problems first, allow trainees to develop solutions, then provide expert guidance—as practiced by Saud Maan (SM).\n\n2. **Role-playing Scenarios**: Incorporate customer personas with specific objections for sales practice, following Muthanna Al Mashhadani's approach (MM).\n\n3. **Competitive Challenges**: Implement timed assembly competitions as Saud Maan recommended (SM).\n\n4. **Visual Learning Priority**: Follow Mohammed's emphasis on demonstration over lecturing (MQ).\n\n### Community Building\n\n1. **Green Festival**: Host an end-of-program showcase where trainees present their projects, implementing Saud's idea for connecting with employers (SM).\n\n2. **Alumni Network**: Establish regular meetups based on Dr. Nasih's observation of continued alumni relationships (DN).\n\n3. **Ecosystem Dinner**: Bring together all stakeholders for relationship-building beyond the formal program.\n\n## 9. Open Questions and Research Agenda\n\nSeveral critical questions emerged that require further investigation:\n\n1. **Solar Water Heating Relevance**: How suitable are solar water heaters for Mosul's climate and typical household needs?\n\n2. **Community Attitude Shift**: What strategies can effectively change broader community perceptions about green building approaches?\n\n3. **Women's Participation**: What specific methods would encourage and support women's participation in the solar industry?\n\n4. **Certification Value**: What certificate format and endorsements would maximize graduate credibility with employers?\n\n5. **Quality Assurance Standards**: What local standards should be established for installation quality and system performance?\n\n6. **Collaborative Market Development**: How can we better foster cooperation rather than competition among green building professionals?\n\n## 10. Next Steps\n\n### Immediate Actions (Pre-Pilot)\n1. Develop detailed materials list with specifications and quantities\n2. Create a repository of case studies from trainer interviews\n3. Design a certificate format with industry validation\n4. Establish MOUs with firms willing to host site visits\n5. Develop the daily assessment quizzes for M&E purposes\n\n### Medium-Term Actions (During Pilot)\n1. Document insights from daily reflection walls\n2. Test the effectiveness of the sales engineering approach\n3. Measure hiring outcomes from industry presentations\n4. Gather trainee feedback on technical vs. communication skills\n\n### Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months)\n1. Develop the solar water heater micro-track (DN)\n2. Formalize the alumni network with scheduled activities\n3. Expand the \"failure wall\" documentation\n4. Explore regional expansion based on pilot outcomes\n5. Create a comprehensive market guide with component prices\n\n---\n\nThis training approach represents a synthesis of insights from experienced local trainers. By focusing on \"sales engineering\"—understanding and solving customer problems rather than simply installing technology—we aim to develop both technical expertise and market-building skills. Our evidence suggests that emphasizing empathy, hands-on learning, and real-world problem-solving will better prepare trainees for success in Mosul's unique market conditions.\n\nOur next deliverable will include the detailed facilitation guide with day-by-day lesson plans, handouts, and assessment tools based on this strategic framework.",

The data consistently shows that successful solar professionals in Mosul must function as \"sales engineers\" who understand customer problems before proposing technical solutions.\n\nThis document synthesizes insights from trainers with decades of collective experience to outline a training approach specifically adapted to Mosul's unique context. The emphasis on hands-on learning, real-world problem-solving, and market connection has been validated through multiple interviews and aligns with local employment pathways.\n\n## 1. Methodology\n\nOur approach involved structured interviews with key solar and related professionals in Mosul:\n\n| Interview ID | Date (2025) | Participant | Key Expertise |\n|--------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|\n| INT-01 | 14 May | Hussam Falih (HF) – Enterprise-Development Specialist, OXFAM | Market research, local pricing |\n| INT-02 | 14 May | Muayad Hasan (MH) – RENAC Master-Trainer | Simulation tools, story-based teaching |\n| INT-03 | 16 May | Ali Abkan (AA) – Technical Support Engineer, Chisage ESS | Component quality, datasheet literacy |\n| INT-04 | 18 May | Saud Maan (SM) – Lecturer, College of Electrical Engineering | Competition-based assessment |\n| INT-05 | 18 May | Mohammed Al-Qatan (MQ) – Director, Mosul Solar Co. | Visual learning, hands-on methods |\n| INT-06 | 19 May | Mustafa Waleed (MW) – Mosul Space / Electrical office | Battery systems, hybrid inverters |\n| INT-07 | 20 May | Dr. Nasih Hma Salah (DN) – PhD nanoscience, RENAC Master-Trainer | Internship pathways, market ethics |\n\nAdditional insights came from Omar Laith (OL), Muthanna Al Mashhadani (MM), and others through the Mosul Reconstruction Meetup. We used rapid-coding to identify recurring themes, then clustered these into actionable program elements.\n\n## 2. Sales Engineering: Learning from Trainer Experience\n\nMultiple trainers emphasized that successful solar installations begin with understanding customer needs rather than leading with technology. This insight has shaped our concept of \"sales engineering\"—positioning installers as problem-solvers who help customers recognize their needs before proposing technical solutions.\n\n### Understanding Before Selling\n\nAs Mohammed Al-Qatan noted, \"We have nothing called theory; we are all practical work\" (INT-05). This hands-on approach extends beyond technical practice to include customer interactions—trainees learn to conduct thorough needs assessments before proposing solutions.\n\n### Building Trust Through Guarantees\n\nField observations revealed effective trust-building approaches: \"If your room isn't 10 degrees cooler in three weeks, you don't pay.\" These performance guarantees address market skepticism and demonstrate installer confidence. The training incorporates these strategies based on real market practices in Mosul.\n\n### Market Connection Through Demonstration\n\nMultiple employers stated they would \"immediately hire high-performers\" based on demonstrated skills. As Mohammed Al-Qatan emphasized, \"Real interviews... the experience will teach them\" (INT-05). This direct evidence suggests that showing skills in action is more valuable than certificates alone.\n\n## 3. Stakeholder Ecosystem\n\nOur interviews revealed a complex ecosystem of stakeholders with specific interests in the training program:\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n\n\nKey stakeholder interests and engagement methods:\n\n1. **Master & Assistant Trainers**: Need clear curriculum, safety oversight, and credible certification (MQ). The program provides a 6-day modular guide, QC checklists, and badges master trainers on certificates.\n\n2. **Trainee Cohort**: Need fast path to income, hands-on practice, and recognized credentials (HF, MW). The program delivers 70% practical training, two live-site days, and portfolio development.\n\n3. **Solar Installation Firms**: Need pre-vetted recruits and visibility to talent (SM). The program invites firms as Day-6 jury members and arranges internship MOUs.\n\n4. **Equipment Suppliers**: Need product promotion and trustworthy installers (MW). The program uses their stock for demos and highlights quality differences in datasheet-reading labs.\n\n5. **Government Agencies**: Need job creation metrics and uptake of green technology (DN). The program aligns certificates with MoLSA loan criteria and targets high-damage districts.\n\n6. **International Certifiers**: Need quality assurance and global credential standards (DN). The program maps course outcomes to RENAC competencies and co-brands certificates.\n\n7. **Finance/Micro-Credit Actors**: Need bankable business plans and ROI proofs (MW). The program includes ROI calculators and a Q&A session with loan providers.\n\n8. **Community Clients**: Need reliable power, lower bills, and comfort (HF, MW). Trainees conduct 30 home/shop audits and develop sales scripts focused on pain points.\n\n9. **Alumni Network**: Need ongoing support and job leads (DN). The program establishes WhatsApp groups and festival reunions, with alumni invited as next-cohort mentors.\n\n10. **Heritage-Oriented Architects**: Need modern-heritage guidelines and market differentiation (SM). The program develops a \"modern-heritage solutions list\" capstone with architects judging designs.\n\nHigh-leverage actors include equipment suppliers (MW) who offer free panels for demos and government loan programs that help graduates establish businesses. Gaps remain in formal banking partnerships that need addressing during implementation.\n\n## 4. Program Structure: Evidence-Based 6-Day Framework\n\nBased on trainer interviews, we've developed a 6-day structure that balances technical skills with market connection:\n\n| Day | Core Focus | Key Activities | Evidence Base |\n|-----|------------|----------------|--------------|\n| 1 | Understanding Needs | Site assessment, load calculation in amps, empathy interviews | \"Iraqis speak in amps, not kWh\" (HF, INT-01); Site audit emphasis (MH, INT-02) |\n| 2 | Components & Safety | Inverter examination, DC safety lab, datasheet literacy | \"DC is not as forgiving as AC\" (SM, INT-04); \"The most important thing is the datasheet\" (AA, INT-03) |\n| 3 | System Design | Software simulation, shade analysis, ROI calculation | \"PVsyst extensively; advocates simulation before field work\" (MH, INT-02); Battery placement (MW, INT-06) |\n| 4 | Installation Practice | Mounting techniques, wiring, battery management | \"Poor mounting structures fail in wind\" (MH, INT-02); \"I've seen panels that move with the wind\" (MQ, INT-05) |\n| 5 | Sales Engineering | Value proposition, objection handling, performance guarantees | \"Run the numbers so people see why 'expensive' is cheaper\" (AA, INT-03); Market price collection (DN, INT-07) |\n| 6 | Industry Connection | System assembly competition, technical demos, presentations | \"System-assembly competition judged by employers\" (SM, INT-04); \"Mock job interviews as assessment\" (MQ, INT-05) |\n\nThis structure implements the 70% practical emphasis consistently recommended by trainers. As Mohammed Al-Qatan emphasized, \"We have nothing called theory; we are all practical work\" (INT-05). The framework provides multiple touchpoints with potential employers, including the \"Solar Festival\" concept proposed by Saud Maan (INT-04).\n\n## 5. Daily Structure: Engagement Through Practice\n\nBased on trainer recommendations, we've created a daily framework that prioritizes engagement and practical application:\n\n| Time Block | Activity | Purpose | Evidence Base |\n|------------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| 09:00-09:30 | Knowledge Check | Interactive quiz to assess retention | Bologna method - frame learning goals (DN, INT-07) |\n| 09:30-11:00 | Hands-on Skills | Station-based rotation through practical activities | \"Learners remember by doing - keep theory < 20%\" (SM, INT-04) |\n| 11:00-11:15 | Peer Teaching | Trainees teach each other key concepts | Micro-teaching approach (HF, INT-01) |\n| 11:15-12:30 | Problem Scenarios | Team-based troubleshooting of case examples | \"Common errors: SPD wiring, DC-polarity swaps\" (SM, INT-04) |\n| 13:30-15:30 | Capstone Work | Apply learning to real-world projects | \"Each person designs a complete system from A to Z\" (HF, INT-01) |\n| 15:30-15:45 | Reflection Wall | Capture insights and questions | \"Story-based teaching; ends each day with a trainee review circle & anonymous sticky notes\" (MH, INT-02) |\n| 15:45-16:00 | Integration | Connect day's learning to larger context | Frame session & learning goals (DN, INT-07) |\n\nThis structure begins with engagement to reduce passivity, incorporates peer learning for communication skills, and emphasizes practical application to real problems. The reflection wall adapts Muayad's sticky-note method (INT-02), though with named notes for M&E purposes as recommended in partner feedback.\n\n## 6. Technical Insights: Lessons from the Field\n\nOur interviews revealed several critical technical insights that create significant value in Mosul's context:\n\n### Heat Management as System Design\n\nMustafa Waleed explained how batteries placed in \"baytuna\" (stairwell enclosures) suffer from a greenhouse effect: \"Biggest failure he sees: batteries thrown in hot, dusty store-rooms; life drops fast. Needs a cool, clean spot even if cables get longer\" (INT-06). This insight has led to a new mini-module on battery placement and ventilation, including cable-sizing calculations for remote packs.\n\n### Mounting Failures and Wind Damage\n\nMuayad Hasan highlighted that \"Poor mounting structures fail in wind; need structural calcs\" (INT-02). Similarly, Mohammed Al-Qatan reported \"I've seen panels that move, meaning the entire rack moves with the wind\" (INT-05). These insights have led to adding structural load worksheets and torque-wrench practicals on Day 4.\n\n### DC Safety is Non-Negotiable\n\nMultiple trainers emphasized DC safety concerns. Hussam Falih noted that \"DC-cable spec & breaker sizing often ignored → fires\" (INT-01), while Saud Maan identified \"Common errors: SPD wiring, DC-polarity swaps\" (INT-04). In response, we've added a 45-minute DC vs AC wiring safety lab on Day 2.\n\n### Cleaning and Maintenance Protocols\n\nHussam Falih identified that \"Dust neglect biggest performance killer; needs demo\" (INT-01), while Muayad Hasan noted that \"Dust cleaning must avoid midday wash in summer\" (INT-02). These insights have led to including a \"dirty-vs-clean\" watt demonstration and panel-cleaning standard operating procedures on Day 5.\n\n## 7. Market Development Insights\n\n### The Ubuntu Approach to Market Creation\n\nSeveral trainers emphasized that the green building sector in Mosul needs market expansion rather than competition. This aligns with the Ubuntu philosophy (\"I am because we are\") and the \"rising tide lifts all boats\" approach—teaching solar installers, insulation specialists, and architects to see themselves as complementary parts of a sustainable building ecosystem.\n\n### Solar Water Heaters as Market Entry\n\nDr. Nasih noted that \"solar-water-heater intro can be taught in 3 days as a lower-barrier track\" (INT-07). These simpler systems build customer trust while allowing new technicians to develop skills with lower initial investment.\n\n### Quality Assurance and Follow-up\n\nAli Abkan highlighted that the \"Market flooded with fake 10-year warranties\" (INT-03), while Hussam Falih emphasized maintenance needs. The training includes myths-busting about fake warranties and developing after-sales service packages.\n\n### Financial Barriers and Solutions\n\nMustafa Waleed provided specific ROI figures: \"Hybrid inverters cost ≈ + US $1,000; commercial pay-back < 2 years; residential 6-8 yrs (dep. on loads)\" (INT-06). Hussam Falih noted that \"Up-front cost is the main adoption barrier → link to Ministry-of-Labour loans\" (INT-01). These insights have led to including loan officer information and detailed ROI calculations in the training.\n\n## 8. Implementation Recommendations\n\nBased on trainer interviews and field observations, we recommend the following implementation strategies:\n\n### Equipment and Resources\n\n1. **Tool Library**: Establish a borrowing system for specialized tools, addressing the initial equipment cost concerns raised by multiple trainers.\n\n2. **Material Library**: Create physical displays of component options with quality comparisons, implementing Ali Abkan's approach to quality assessment (INT-03).\n\n3. **Testing Rig**: Develop a demonstration unit for battery box cooling solutions based on Mustafa Waleed's insights on heat management (INT-06).\n\n4. **Failure Wall**: Collect examples of failed installations as recommended by Mohammed Al-Qatan and others (INT-05).\n\n### Teaching Methods\n\n1. **Flipped Classroom Approach**: Present problems first, allow trainees to develop solutions, then provide expert guidance—aligning with Saud Maan's emphasis on learning by doing (INT-04).\n\n2. **Visual Learning Priority**: Follow Mohammed's emphasis on demonstration over lecturing: \"Day 1 to start hands-on inverter tear-down; theory woven later\" (INT-05).\n\n3. **Datasheet Literacy**: Implement Ali Abkan's recommendation for \"datasheet scavenger-hunt worksheet\" (INT-03) and Mustafa Waleed's focus on \"reading datasheet 'critical rows'\" (INT-06).\n\n4. **Competitive Challenges**: Implement Saud Maan's suggestion for a \"system-assembly competition judged by employers\" (INT-04).\n\n### Community Building\n\n1. **Solar Festival**: Host Saud Maan's suggested \"Solar Festival linking trainees to 10-15 Mosul companies\" (INT-04).\n\n2. **Alumni Network**: Support the development of lasting relationships that Dr. Nasih observed among RENAC alumni who are \"still 'أصحاب' after 30 days together\" (INT-07).\n\n3. **Internship Pipeline**: Implement Dr. Nasih's proposal for \"subsidised 2-month internships after course (company gains free helper, trainee gains experience)\" (INT-07).\n\n## 9. Certification and Pathway Development\n\nOur interviews revealed specific certification needs and employment pathways:\n\n### Co-Branded Certification\n\nAli Abkan emphasized that \"Credibility depends on certificates co-signed by major brands (Gisage, Huawei)\" (INT-03). We are working to secure RENAC co-branding for certificates, as well as MoLSA recognition to help graduates qualify for micro-loans.\n\n### Internship Pathway\n\nDr. Nasih proposed \"subsidised 2-month internships after course\" (INT-07), while Saud Maan suggested linking graduates to local companies through the Solar Festival. We have secured preliminary agreements from five Mosul installers to host graduates, with the project covering the first-month stipend.\n\n### Portfolio Evidence\n\nEach graduate will be required to upload at least one PV-Report and installation photo to LinkedIn, with a QR code linking to the portfolio printed on the back of their certificate. This addresses the consistent feedback that practical demonstration of skills is more valuable than the certificate itself.\n\n## 10. Open Questions and Research Agenda\n\nSeveral critical questions emerged that require further investigation:\n\n1. **Solar Water Heating Relevance**: How suitable are solar water heaters for Mosul's climate and typical household needs?\n\n2. **Community Attitude Shift**: What strategies can effectively change broader community perceptions about green building approaches?\n\n3. **Women's Participation**: What specific methods would encourage and support women's participation in the solar industry?\n\n4. **Quality Assurance Standards**: What local standards should be established for installation quality and system performance?\n\n5. **Collaborative Market Development**: How can we better foster cooperation rather than competition among green building professionals?\n\n## 11. Next Steps\n\n### Immediate Actions (Pre-Pilot)\n1. Sign MoU with Mosul Space & Ali's installer group (by 18 May)\n2. Purchase training rig & pathfinders (by 25 May)\n3. Draft certificate layout with RENAC placeholder (by 1 June)\n4. Develop field-survey checklist in Arabic/English (by 5 June)\n5. Submit syllabus to MoLSA (by 10 June)\n6. Confirm final venue & upload kit pictures (by 15 June)\n\n### Medium-Term Actions (During Pilot)\n1. Document insights from daily reflection walls\n2. Test the effectiveness of the sales engineering approach\n3. Measure hiring outcomes from industry presentations\n4. Gather trainee feedback on technical vs. communication skills\n\n### Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months)\n1. Develop the solar water heater micro-track as suggested by Dr. Nasih\n2. Formalize the alumni network with scheduled activities\n3. Expand the \"failure wall\" documentation\n4. Create a comprehensive market guide with component prices\n5. Secure MoLSA & MoE support for graduate loan access\n\n---\n\nThis training approach is directly informed by the experiences and recommendations of Mosul's solar professionals. Our evidence shows that by combining technical expertise with sales engineering skills, graduates will be better equipped to succeed in Mosul's unique market conditions. The strong focus on practical learning, real customer problems, and direct employer connections creates a program that delivers immediate value to all stakeholders in the ecosystem.",

            "text": "# From Wires to Work: Insight-Driven Solar Training Strategy for Mosul\n\n**Final Draft: Output 1 Deliverable 1**\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThrough systematic engagement with over 30 local experts and 15 in-depth interviews with master trainers from Mosul, we've developed an evidence-based approach to solar training that addresses both technical skills and market realities. The data consistently shows that successful solar professionals in Mosul must function as \"sales engineers\" who understand customer problems before proposing technical solutions.\n\nThis document synthesizes insights from trainers with decades of collective experience to outline a training approach specifically adapted to Mosul's unique context. The emphasis on hands-on learning, real-world problem-solving, and market connection has been validated through multiple interviews and aligns with local employment pathways.\n\n## 1. Methodology\n\nOur approach involved structured interviews with key solar and related professionals in Mosul:\n\n| Interview ID | Date (2025) | Participant | Key Expertise |\n|--------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|\n| INT-01 | 14 May | Hussam Falih (HF) – Enterprise-Development Specialist, OXFAM | Market research, local pricing |\n| INT-02 | 14 May | Muayad Hasan (MH) – RENAC Master-Trainer | Simulation tools, story-based teaching |\n| INT-03 | 16 May | Ali Abkan (AA) – Technical Support Engineer, Chisage ESS | Component quality, datasheet literacy |\n| INT-04 | 18 May | Saud Maan (SM) – Lecturer, College of Electrical Engineering | Competition-based assessment |\n| INT-05 | 18 May | Mohammed Al-Qatan (MQ) – Director, Mosul Solar Co. | Visual learning, hands-on methods |\n| INT-06 | 19 May | Mustafa Waleed (MW) – Mosul Space / Electrical office | Battery systems, hybrid inverters |\n| INT-07 | 20 May | Dr. Nasih Hma Salah (DN) – PhD nanoscience, RENAC Master-Trainer | Internship pathways, market ethics |\n\nAdditional insights came from Omar Laith (OL), Muthanna Al Mashhadani (MM), and others through the Mosul Reconstruction Meetup. We used rapid-coding to identify recurring themes, then clustered these into actionable program elements.\n\n## 2. Sales Engineering: Learning from Trainer Experience\n\nMultiple trainers emphasized that successful solar installations begin with understanding customer needs rather than leading with technology. This insight has shaped our concept of \"sales engineering\"—positioning installers as problem-solvers who help customers recognize their needs before proposing technical solutions.\n\n### Understanding Before Selling\n\nAs Mohammed Al-Qatan noted, \"We have nothing called theory; we are all practical work\" (INT-05). This hands-on approach extends beyond technical practice to include customer interactions—trainees learn to conduct thorough needs assessments before proposing solutions.\n\n### Building Trust Through Guarantees\n\nField observations revealed effective trust-building approaches: \"If your room isn't 10 degrees cooler in three weeks, you don't pay.\" These performance guarantees address market skepticism and demonstrate installer confidence. The training incorporates these strategies based on real market practices in Mosul.\n\n### Market Connection Through Demonstration\n\nMultiple employers stated they would \"immediately hire high-performers\" based on demonstrated skills. As Mohammed Al-Qatan emphasized, \"Real interviews... the experience will teach them\" (INT-05). This direct evidence suggests that showing skills in action is more valuable than certificates alone.\n\n## 3. Stakeholder Ecosystem\n\nOur interviews revealed a complex ecosystem of stakeholders with specific interests in the training program:",

            "text": "\n\nKey stakeholder interests and engagement methods:\n\n1. **Master & Assistant Trainers**: Need clear curriculum, safety oversight, and credible certification (MQ). The program provides a 6-day modular guide, QC checklists, and badges master trainers on certificates.\n\n2. **Trainee Cohort**: Need fast path to income, hands-on practice, and recognized credentials (HF, MW). The program delivers 70% practical training, two live-site days, and portfolio development.\n\n3. **Solar Installation Firms**: Need pre-vetted recruits and visibility to talent (SM). The program invites firms as Day-6 jury members and arranges internship MOUs.\n\n4. **Equipment Suppliers**: Need product promotion and trustworthy installers (MW). The program uses their stock for demos and highlights quality differences in datasheet-reading labs.\n\n5. **Government Agencies**: Need job creation metrics and uptake of green technology (DN). The program aligns certificates with MoLSA loan criteria and targets high-damage districts.\n\n6. **International Certifiers**: Need quality assurance and global credential standards (DN). The program maps course outcomes to RENAC competencies and co-brands certificates.\n\n7. **Finance/Micro-Credit Actors**: Need bankable business plans and ROI proofs (MW). The program includes ROI calculators and a Q&A session with loan providers.\n\n8. **Community Clients**: Need reliable power, lower bills, and comfort (HF, MW). Trainees conduct 30 home/shop audits and develop sales scripts focused on pain points.\n\n9. **Alumni Network**: Need ongoing support and job leads (DN). The program establishes WhatsApp groups and festival reunions, with alumni invited as next-cohort mentors.\n\n10. **Heritage-Oriented Architects**: Need modern-heritage guidelines and market differentiation (SM). The program develops a \"modern-heritage solutions list\" capstone with architects judging designs.\n\nHigh-leverage actors include equipment suppliers (MW) who offer free panels for demos and government loan programs that help graduates establish businesses. Gaps remain in formal banking partnerships that need addressing during implementation.\n\n## 4. Program Structure: Evidence-Based 6-Day Framework\n\nBased on trainer interviews, we've developed a 6-day structure that balances technical skills with market connection:\n\n| Day | Core Focus | Key Activities | Evidence Base |\n|-----|------------|----------------|--------------|\n| 1 | Understanding Needs | Site assessment, load calculation in amps, empathy interviews | \"Iraqis speak in amps, not kWh\" (HF, INT-01); Site audit emphasis (MH, INT-02) |\n| 2 | Components & Safety | Inverter examination, DC safety lab, datasheet literacy | \"DC is not as forgiving as AC\" (SM, INT-04); \"The most important thing is the datasheet\" (AA, INT-03) |\n| 3 | System Design | Software simulation, shade analysis, ROI calculation | \"PVsyst extensively; advocates simulation before field work\" (MH, INT-02); Battery placement (MW, INT-06) |\n| 4 | Installation Practice | Mounting techniques, wiring, battery management | \"Poor mounting structures fail in wind\" (MH, INT-02); \"I've seen panels that move with the wind\" (MQ, INT-05) |\n| 5 | Sales Engineering | Value proposition, objection handling, performance guarantees | \"Run the numbers so people see why 'expensive' is cheaper\" (AA, INT-03); Market price collection (DN, INT-07) |\n| 6 | Industry Connection | System assembly competition, technical demos, presentations | \"System-assembly competition judged by employers\" (SM, INT-04); \"Mock job interviews as assessment\" (MQ, INT-05) |\n\nThis structure implements the 70% practical emphasis consistently recommended by trainers. As Mohammed Al-Qatan emphasized, \"We have nothing called theory; we are all practical work\" (INT-05). The framework provides multiple touchpoints with potential employers, including the \"Solar Festival\" concept proposed by Saud Maan (INT-04).\n\n## 5. Daily Structure: Engagement Through Practice\n\nBased on trainer recommendations, we've created a daily framework that prioritizes engagement and practical application:\n\n| Time Block | Activity | Purpose | Evidence Base |\n|------------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| 09:00-09:30 | Knowledge Check | Interactive quiz to assess retention | Bologna method - frame learning goals (DN, INT-07) |\n| 09:30-11:00 | Hands-on Skills | Station-based rotation through practical activities | \"Learners remember by doing - keep theory < 20%\" (SM, INT-04) |\n| 11:00-11:15 | Peer Teaching | Trainees teach each other key concepts | Micro-teaching approach (HF, INT-01) |\n| 11:15-12:30 | Problem Scenarios | Team-based troubleshooting of case examples | \"Common errors: SPD wiring, DC-polarity swaps\" (SM, INT-04) |\n| 13:30-15:30 | Capstone Work | Apply learning to real-world projects | \"Each person designs a complete system from A to Z\" (HF, INT-01) |\n| 15:30-15:45 | Reflection Wall | Capture insights and questions | \"Story-based teaching; ends each day with a trainee review circle & anonymous sticky notes\" (MH, INT-02) |\n| 15:45-16:00 | Integration | Connect day's learning to larger context | Frame session & learning goals (DN, INT-07) |\n\nThis structure begins with engagement to reduce passivity, incorporates peer learning for communication skills, and emphasizes practical application to real problems. The reflection wall adapts Muayad's sticky-note method (INT-02), though with named notes for M&E purposes as recommended in partner feedback.\n\n## 6. Technical Insights: Lessons from the Field\n\nOur interviews revealed several critical technical insights that create significant value in Mosul's context:\n\n### Heat Management as System Design\n\nMustafa Waleed explained how batteries placed in \"baytuna\" (stairwell enclosures) suffer from a greenhouse effect: \"Biggest failure he sees: batteries thrown in hot, dusty store-rooms; life drops fast. Needs a cool, clean spot even if cables get longer\" (INT-06). This insight has led to a new mini-module on battery placement and ventilation, including cable-sizing calculations for remote packs.\n\n### Mounting Failures and Wind Damage\n\nMuayad Hasan highlighted that \"Poor mounting structures fail in wind; need structural calcs\" (INT-02). Similarly, Mohammed Al-Qatan reported \"I've seen panels that move, meaning the entire rack moves with the wind\" (INT-05). These insights have led to adding structural load worksheets and torque-wrench practicals on Day 4.\n\n### DC Safety is Non-Negotiable\n\nMultiple trainers emphasized DC safety concerns. Hussam Falih noted that \"DC-cable spec & breaker sizing often ignored → fires\" (INT-01), while Saud Maan identified \"Common errors: SPD wiring, DC-polarity swaps\" (INT-04). In response, we've added a 45-minute DC vs AC wiring safety lab on Day 2.\n\n### Cleaning and Maintenance Protocols\n\nHussam Falih identified that \"Dust neglect biggest performance killer; needs demo\" (INT-01), while Muayad Hasan noted that \"Dust cleaning must avoid midday wash in summer\" (INT-02). These insights have led to including a \"dirty-vs-clean\" watt demonstration and panel-cleaning standard operating procedures on Day 5.\n\n## 7. Market Development Insights\n\n### The Ubuntu Approach to Market Creation\n\nSeveral trainers emphasized that the green building sector in Mosul needs market expansion rather than competition. This aligns with the Ubuntu philosophy (\"I am because we are\") and the \"rising tide lifts all boats\" approach—teaching solar installers, insulation specialists, and architects to see themselves as complementary parts of a sustainable building ecosystem.\n\n### Solar Water Heaters as Market Entry\n\nDr. Nasih noted that \"solar-water-heater intro can be taught in 3 days as a lower-barrier track\" (INT-07). These simpler systems build customer trust while allowing new technicians to develop skills with lower initial investment.\n\n### Quality Assurance and Follow-up\n\nAli Abkan highlighted that the \"Market flooded with fake 10-year warranties\" (INT-03), while Hussam Falih emphasized maintenance needs. The training includes myths-busting about fake warranties and developing after-sales service packages.\n\n### Financial Barriers and Solutions\n\nMustafa Waleed provided specific ROI figures: \"Hybrid inverters cost ≈ + US $1,000; commercial pay-back < 2 years; residential 6-8 yrs (dep. on loads)\" (INT-06). Hussam Falih noted that \"Up-front cost is the main adoption barrier → link to Ministry-of-Labour loans\" (INT-01). These insights have led to including loan officer information and detailed ROI calculations in the training.\n\n## 8. Implementation Recommendations\n\nBased on trainer interviews and field observations, we recommend the following implementation strategies:\n\n### Equipment and Resources\n\n1. **Tool Library**: Establish a borrowing system for specialized tools, addressing the initial equipment cost concerns raised by multiple trainers.\n\n2. **Material Library**: Create physical displays of component options with quality comparisons, implementing Ali Abkan's approach to quality assessment (INT-03).\n\n3. **Testing Rig**: Develop a demonstration unit for battery box cooling solutions based on Mustafa Waleed's insights on heat management (INT-06).\n\n4. **Failure Wall**: Collect examples of failed installations as recommended by Mohammed Al-Qatan and others (INT-05).\n\n### Teaching Methods\n\n1. **Flipped Classroom Approach**: Present problems first, allow trainees to develop solutions, then provide expert guidance—aligning with Saud Maan's emphasis on learning by doing (INT-04).\n\n2. **Visual Learning Priority**: Follow Mohammed's emphasis on demonstration over lecturing: \"Day 1 to start hands-on inverter tear-down; theory woven later\" (INT-05).\n\n3. **Datasheet Literacy**: Implement Ali Abkan's recommendation for \"datasheet scavenger-hunt worksheet\" (INT-03) and Mustafa Waleed's focus on \"reading datasheet 'critical rows'\" (INT-06).\n\n4. **Competitive Challenges**: Implement Saud Maan's suggestion for a \"system-assembly competition judged by employers\" (INT-04).\n\n### Community Building\n\n1. **Solar Festival**: Host Saud Maan's suggested \"Solar Festival linking trainees to 10-15 Mosul companies\" (INT-04).\n\n2. **Alumni Network**: Support the development of lasting relationships that Dr. Nasih observed among RENAC alumni who are \"still 'أصحاب' after 30 days together\" (INT-07).\n\n3. **Internship Pipeline**: Implement Dr. Nasih's proposal for \"subsidised 2-month internships after course (company gains free helper, trainee gains experience)\" (INT-07).\n\n## 9. Certification and Pathway Development\n\nOur interviews revealed specific certification needs and employment pathways:\n\n### Co-Branded Certification\n\nAli Abkan emphasized that \"Credibility depends on certificates co-signed by major brands (Gisage, Huawei)\" (INT-03). We are working to secure RENAC co-branding for certificates, as well as MoLSA recognition to help graduates qualify for micro-loans.\n\n### Internship Pathway\n\nDr. Nasih proposed \"subsidised 2-month internships after course\" (INT-07), while Saud Maan suggested linking graduates to local companies through the Solar Festival. We have secured preliminary agreements from five Mosul installers to host graduates, with the project covering the first-month stipend.\n\n### Portfolio Evidence\n\nEach graduate will be required to upload at least one PV-Report and installation photo to LinkedIn, with a QR code linking to the portfolio printed on the back of their certificate. This addresses the consistent feedback that practical demonstration of skills is more valuable than the certificate itself.\n\n## 10. Open Questions and Research Agenda\n\nSeveral critical questions emerged that require further investigation:\n\n1. **Solar Water Heating Relevance**: How suitable are solar water heaters for Mosul's climate and typical household needs?\n\n2. **Community Attitude Shift**: What strategies can effectively change broader community perceptions about green building approaches?\n\n3. **Women's Participation**: What specific methods would encourage and support women's participation in the solar industry?\n\n4. **Quality Assurance Standards**: What local standards should be established for installation quality and system performance?\n\n5. **Collaborative Market Development**: How can we better foster cooperation rather than competition among green building professionals?\n\n## 11. Next Steps\n\n### Immediate Actions (Pre-Pilot)\n1. Sign MoU with Mosul Space & Ali's installer group (by 18 May)\n2. Purchase training rig & pathfinders (by 25 May)\n3. Draft certificate layout with RENAC placeholder (by 1 June)\n4. Develop field-survey checklist in Arabic/English (by 5 June)\n5. Submit syllabus to MoLSA (by 10 June)\n6. Confirm final venue & upload kit pictures (by 15 June)\n\n### Medium-Term Actions (During Pilot)\n1. Document insights from daily reflection walls\n2. Test the effectiveness of the sales engineering approach\n3. Measure hiring outcomes from industry presentations\n4. Gather trainee feedback on technical vs. communication skills\n\n### Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months)\n1. Develop the solar water heater micro-track as suggested by Dr. Nasih\n2. Formalize the alumni network with scheduled activities\n3. Expand the \"failure wall\" documentation\n4. Create a comprehensive market guide with component prices\n5. Secure MoLSA & MoE support for graduate loan access\n\n---\n\nThis training approach is directly informed by the experiences and recommendations of Mosul's solar professionals. Our evidence shows that by combining technical expertise with sales engineering skills, graduates will be better equipped to succeed in Mosul's unique market conditions. The strong focus on practical learning, real customer problems, and direct employer connections creates a program that delivers immediate value to all stakeholders in the ecosystem.",
