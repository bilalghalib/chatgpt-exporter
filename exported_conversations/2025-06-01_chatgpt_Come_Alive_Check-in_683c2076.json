Like, could you tell me what I need to be doing? I have a friend, Muffin, visiting. I finished the majority of my work that I have to do today, so I'm kind of free now. But of course, like, because I did some work, now my brain is, like, revving on work. It's like, oh, I could have done this better. You know, maybe I could improve this or something like that. And I never feel like I'm done, you know, like I've done my job good enough or something like that. And in terms of energy, I'm trying this dexamethamine thing and instead of Adderall. It's good. I don't feel it. I guess it's good. I don't know if it's helping me focus. I don't know if I should take more. Like, I took five grams maybe three hours ago, and I'm trying to, like, you know, I have a new doctor in Belgium who is my therapist, psychiatrist, and so he's giving me this stuff. The experiment in five milligrams is pretty low. I used to take 20 milligrams of Adderall. I don't know if there's, like, an equivalency thing, so I can try to get something that maybe feels similar. And what else? Yeah, I did this letter to my brother thing because my brother got into a fight with my other brother, and I wanted to be a part of my family and help. And I tried my best, and I wrote this letter, and I sent it to my dad, but I didn't really have a lot of time to follow up to see if he actually did it. And I kind of am nervous about it. It's like a scary thing to do, this family intervention. I know family interventions generally all fail or have problems, so I'm wondering if I should just not do anything. I don't know. So, I have a friend here I haven't seen in a long time, and I'm excited to have him here. And I'm going out for some mushrooms, and I'll be coming back soon, I think, home because it's almost lunchtime. And energy levels, I'd say, it's like a 3.5.
