      "content": "Pear-shaped puffballs (Latin: **Lycoperdon pyriforme**) are edible **only when the inside is pure white and firm**. Once they start to yellow, turn green, or powdery inside, they’re too mature and should not be eaten.  \n\nHere’s how you can cook them:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Clean & Check**\n- Slice each puffball in half lengthwise.  \n- Make sure the interior is solid, white, and free from gills (to avoid confusing them with young poisonous Amanitas).  \n- Trim off any tough base where it was attached to wood.  \n- Brush off dirt, rinse lightly if needed, then pat dry.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Basic Pan-Fry (the classic way)**\n1. Slice puffballs into ½ cm (¼ inch) slices.  \n2. Heat butter or olive oil in a skillet.  \n3. Add slices, season with salt, pepper, and maybe garlic.  \n4. Fry until golden brown on both sides.  \n   → Texture will be a little like tofu, flavor mild and earthy.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Breaded “Mushroom Cutlets”**\n- Dip slices in beaten egg, then coat in breadcrumbs.  \n- Fry in oil until crispy.  \n- Serve like schnitzel or with dipping sauces.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **In Soups or Stir-Fries**\n- Cube puffballs and toss them into miso soup, vegetable soup, or stir-fries.  \n- They absorb flavors well, so cook with soy sauce, ginger, or herbs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Oven Roasted**\n- Toss chunks in olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme/rosemary.  \n- Roast at ~200°C (400°F) for 15–20 minutes until lightly crisp.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ **Tip**: Cook them soon after harvest; they don’t store long.  \n⚠️ **Always be 100% sure of identification**—puffballs are safe only when solid white inside and not look-alikes.\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to suggest a **Palestinian/Iraqi style recipe** (like with sumac, onions, or spices) since you’ve asked about those flavors before, or keep it more European-style?",
