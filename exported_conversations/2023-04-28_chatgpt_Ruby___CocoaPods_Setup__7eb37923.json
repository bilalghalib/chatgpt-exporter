      "content": "To resolve this error, you need to update your Ruby version to at least 2.7.0 and then install the correct version of activesupport, as the error suggests. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. Update Ruby:\n\n   If you're using macOS, it's recommended to use Homebrew to manage your Ruby installation. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by following the instructions here: https://brew.sh/\n\n   a. To install Ruby using Homebrew, open your terminal and run:\n\n   ```\n   brew install ruby\n   ```\n\n   b. After the installation is complete, you might need to add Homebrew's Ruby path to your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.bash_profile). You can do this by adding the following line to the file:\n\n   ```\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   c. Save the file and restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.zshrc`, or `source ~/.bash_profile` depending on the shell you're using.\n\n   d. Check your Ruby version by running:\n\n   ```\n   ruby -v\n   ```\n\n   Make sure it's at least 2.7.0.\n\n2. Install the compatible version of activesupport:\n\n   ```\n   gem install activesupport -v 6.1.7.3\n   ```\n\n3. Install or update CocoaPods:\n\n   ```\n   sudo gem install cocoapods\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```\n   sudo gem update cocoapods\n   ```\n\n4. If necessary, run `pod setup` to set up CocoaPods.\n\nAfter following these steps, you should be able to use CocoaPods without encountering the error.",

Add `rbenv` to your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.bash_profile) by adding the following line:\n\n   ```\n   eval \"$(rbenv init -)\"\n   ```\n\n   c.

Load `rvm` by adding the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.bash_profile):\n\n   ```\n   source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\n   ```\n\n   c.

      "content": "Apologies for any confusion. You're correct that installing multiple versions of Ruby using different package managers can sometimes lead to conflicts. In this case, since you have concerns about using an external method to update Ruby on your Mac, I would recommend using `rbenv`. `rbenv` is a lightweight tool for managing Ruby versions and provides a safer and more controlled way to switch between them.\n\nHere's how to install and use `rbenv` to update Ruby:\n\n1. Install `rbenv` using Homebrew:\n\n   ```\n   brew install rbenv\n   ```\n\n2. Add `rbenv` to your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.bash_profile) by adding the following line:\n\n   ```\n   eval \"$(rbenv init -)\"\n   ```\n\n3. Save the file and restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.zshrc`, or `source ~/.bash_profile` depending on the shell you're using.\n\n4.

Set the installed Ruby version as the global default:\n\n   ```\n   rbenv global 2.7.0\n   ```\n\n6. Verify that the correct Ruby version is being used:\n\n   ```\n   ruby -v\n   ```\n\nBy using `rbenv`, you should be able to safely manage and switch between Ruby versions without causing conflicts with the system's default Ruby installation. Once you've updated Ruby using `rbenv`, proceed with installing the compatible version of activesupport and CocoaPods as described in my previous answers.",

      "content": "It looks like you already have a `Podfile` in your current directory. The `pod init` command is used to create a new `Podfile`, but since one already exists, you can proceed to the next steps.\n\n1. Open the existing `Podfile` in a text editor or use the terminal command:\n\n   ```\n   open -a TextEdit Podfile\n   ```\n\n2. Add the required dependencies to the `Podfile`. For example, if you want to add the OneSignal dependency, you would add the following line:\n\n   ```\n   pod 'OneSignal', '>= 3.0.0', '< 4.0'\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to add the line within the target block in your `Podfile`.\n\n3. Save the `Podfile` and close the text editor.\n\n4. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `Podfile` and run:\n\n   ```\n   pod install\n   ```\n\n   This command will download and install the specified dependencies, create an `.xcworkspace` file, and integrate the dependencies into your Xcode project.\n\n5. Finally, open your project using the generated `.xcworkspace` file instead of the `.xcodeproj` file. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```\n   open YourProjectName.xcworkspace\n   ```\n\n   Replace `YourProjectName` with the name of your project.\n\nFrom now on, always open the `.xcworkspace` file instead of the `.xcodeproj` file when working on your project, as it includes the necessary dependencies.",

Delete the Derived Data:\n   Remove the Derived Data folder manually by navigating to the path shown in the error message: `/Users/bilalghalib/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/`. Delete the `Lexicon-booiyawvzlchuoglnixnvyiojmgk` folder.\n\n3. Update your dependencies:\n   Make sure you have the latest version of React Native and other dependencies. To update, you can use the following commands:\n   ```\n   npm outdated\n   npm update\n   ```\n\n4. Reinstall node modules and Pods:\n   Remove the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install`. After that, navigate to the `ios` folder and remove the `Podfile.lock` file and `Pods` folder, then run `pod install`.\n\n5. Run the project again:\n   Try running your project again using `npx react-native run-ios`.\n\nIf the problem persists, it could be due to a bug in the Yoga library or an issue with your Xcode setup. In that case, you might want to try downgrading or upgrading React Native, or reinstalling Xcode.",

      "content": "The build process has failed again due to an issue with compiling the Yoga.cpp file in the Yoga library. Since you've already tried the previous suggestions, let's try a few more steps:\n\n1. Downgrade the Yoga library:\n   It's possible that the current version of Yoga is not compatible with your project. You can try downgrading Yoga to an older, more stable version by modifying your Podfile. Locate the line with the Yoga pod and change it to a specific version, like this:\n\n   ```\n   pod 'Yoga', '1.14.0'\n   ```\n\n   Save the Podfile, run `pod install`, and try building your project again.\n\n2. Check your Xcode version:\n   Ensure you are using the latest version of Xcode compatible with your React Native version. If you're using an older version of Xcode, update it through the App Store or download it from the Apple Developer website.\n\n3. Reset the iOS Simulator:\n   Reset the iOS Simulator by going to `Device` > `Erase All Content and Settings`. This will clear all the data and reset the simulator to its default state.\n\n4. Change the iOS Simulator device:\n   It's possible that the issue is specific to the iPhone 14 Pro Max simulator. Try running the project on a different simulator by changing the target device in Xcode or using the `--simulator` flag with `npx react-native run-ios` command, for example:\n\n   ```\n   npx react-native run-ios --simulator=\"iPhone 13\"\n   ```\n\n5. Consider creating a new project:\n   If none of these steps resolve the issue, you can consider creating a new React Native project and copying your existing source code and assets into the new project. This can help if there is a configuration issue in the current project that is hard to identify.\n\n   ```\n   npx react-native init NewProject\n   ```\n\n   After creating the new project, copy your existing source code and assets into the appropriate directories and try building the new project.",
