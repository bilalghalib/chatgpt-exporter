      "content": "You can certainly use a MIDI controller like the Launchpad Mini MK3 as a keyboard shortcut tool, and there are several open source projects that can help you achieve this. Here are some ideas and resources:\n\n1. **MIDI2Key** or **MIDI2Keyboard**: These are scripts or small applications that translate MIDI signals into keyboard shortcuts. You can find various versions of these tools on platforms like GitHub. They work by listening to MIDI input from your Launchpad and then simulating keyboard presses based on the MIDI notes played.\n\n2. **Bome MIDI Translator**: Although not open source, Bome MIDI Translator is a highly versatile software that allows you to convert MIDI messages into keyboard commands, mouse actions, and more. It's particularly powerful if you're looking for complex scripting capabilities.\n\n3. **Python Scripts**: If you're comfortable with programming, you can write a simple Python script using libraries like `mido` for handling MIDI inputs and `pyautogui` or `keyboard` for generating keyboard strokes. This way, you can customize the functionality to your exact needs.\n\n4. **GitHub Projects**: Searching GitHub for \"MIDI keyboard emulator\" or \"MIDI to keystroke\" might lead you to existing projects that others have shared. These can often be customized and are a good starting point if you don't want to start from scratch.\n\nIf you're new to handling MIDI data or programming, using an existing open source project and modifying it to your needs is a good approach. Let me know if you want more specific guidance or resources to get started!",
