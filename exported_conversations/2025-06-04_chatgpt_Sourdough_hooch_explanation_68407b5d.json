      "content": "The liquid on top of your sourdough starter is called **\"hooch.\"** It’s a naturally occurring alcohol that forms when your starter is **hungry**—meaning it hasn’t been fed in a while.\n\n### What it means:\n- **The yeast has run out of food** (sugars/starches in the flour).\n- Hooch can be **clear, greyish, or even yellowish**, like in your photo.\n- It’s **not harmful**, but it’s a sign your starter needs attention.\n\n### What to do:\n1. **Stir it back in** (this adds a slightly tangy flavor) *or* pour it off for a milder taste.\n2. **Feed your starter**: Add equal weights of flour and water (typically 1:1:1 ratio of starter, flour, and water).\n3. Try to **feed it more regularly**, especially if it's kept at room temperature (once or twice daily is ideal).\n\nIf your starter smells very bad (rotten, not just sour), or shows signs of mold (pink, orange, fuzzy spots), then discard and restart. But what you’ve shown looks **totally recoverable**—just a bit neglected.\n\nWould you like help building a feeding and storage schedule?",

      "content": "Great question. Yes, **pouring off the hooch** can help your sourdough starter **recover faster**, especially if it's been sitting for a while.\n\n### Why pouring off helps:\n- **Hooch is acidic** and contains alcohol, which can **slow yeast activity** if left in high concentration.\n- Removing it **lowers the acidity** and gives the yeast a cleaner environment to bounce back.\n- It **reduces the dilution** of the new food you’re about to add, which helps the microbes get what they need more quickly.\n\n### When you might **stir it in** instead:\n- If you're aiming for a **stronger sour flavor** in your bread.\n- If the starter is only lightly neglected (e.g. hooch formed within a day or two).\n\n### Quick recovery steps:\n1. **Pour off the hooch**.\n2. Discard most of the remaining starter (leave about a spoonful).\n3. Feed with fresh flour and water at a 1:1:1 or 1:2:2 ratio (starter:flour:water by weight).\n4. Keep it **in a warm spot** (ideally 24–27°C / 75–80°F) for a few hours to jumpstart activity.\n\nLet me know how long it's been since your last feed and whether it's kept in the fridge or out—happy to tailor a recovery plan.",
