  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is developing a 5-day architecture workshop focused on green and heritage-inspired design for architects in Mosul, Iraq. The workshop aims to teach architects how to integrate traditional passive cooling techniques with modern sustainable design while developing business skills to sell these solutions to clients and community leaders. The user expressed frustration that their current workshop design felt \"messy and disorganized\" and sought help restructuring it to be more focused, energetic, and practical.\n\nThe workshop follows a \"Learn/Apply/Sell\" framework across five days, with each day building skills progressively from understanding heritage cooling principles to delivering complete sustainable design proposals. The user wanted to maintain this structure while making the content more \"architectury\" and hands-on. Key improvements included basing all activities at Beit Turath Al Mosul heritage house as a living laboratory, focusing on real 250-300m² house projects instead of hypothetical 150m² examples, incorporating actual client meetings and supplier visits, and emphasizing practical skills like creating accurate Bills of Quantities (BOQs) with verified local pricing.\n\nThe conversation evolved from diagnosing problems with the existing structure to completely redesigning the workshop from scratch. The user requested a comprehensive JSON structure documenting all slides needed, including specific layout types, content descriptions, speaker notes, and placeholders for images and diagrams. They specified that diagrams should include Mermaid.js code and charts should describe D3.js requirements for later implementation. The final deliverable was a detailed 48-slide presentation structure that progresses from heritage cooling principles through digital modeling tools to professional practice, culminating in a design sprint where participants work on real client briefs from local architecture firms. The user also requested a Python script to process the JSON and generate slides using the Google Slides API, which was enhanced to automatically generate and insert Mermaid diagrams and data visualizations into the presentation.",

Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n\n2\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat. Use IR cameras & empathy maps to find and explain pain.\n2\nMaterials & Trust\nExplore what works for Mosul. Test courtyard ideas, meet suppliers, and pitch comfort ROI.\n3\nRoofs & Realistic Wins\nUse BIM to export roof data, call real suppliers, and build honest BOQs with price proof.\n4\nWalls, Windows & Wellness\nCompare costs and proof types. Fix BOQs, respond to objections, and share proof that works.\n5\nInnovation & Enterprise\nSimulate energy savings, finish your design pack, and give a pitch for system change.\n[09:45–09:50] – Day 1–5 Overview (5 min)\n\nPurpose\u000b Give everyone a fast “big picture” of what we will learn, apply, and sell each day this week.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Participants stay seated, facing the projector.\nMaterials needed: Laptop + pointer / clicker; overview slide already on screen.\nPre-activity checks: Slide is readable from the back; pointer works; timer visible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Friends, before we jump into the details, let’s look at our week on one slide.\u000b You’ll see three columns—Learn, Apply, Sell—and five rows for Days 1-5.\u000b This table shows how each day moves from new knowledge, to hands-on practice, to skills you can pitch or sell.”\nKey Points\nDaily rhythm: We always start by learning the concept, then applying it, then selling the value.\nProgression: Skills build from simple (Day 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding) to advanced (Day 5).\nOutcome focus: Every day ends with something you can explain to a client or boss.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nPoint across one row as an example (e.g., Day 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding).\nHighlight how the three blocks link (“We learn about heat flow, test it with an IR gun, then frame it as savings for homeowners”).\nInvite participants to glance ahead and spot a block they’re excited about (10-second quick show of hands).\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Slide feels text-heavy.\u000b Solution: Use the pointer to focus on one cell at a time, speak slowly.\u000b\nIssue: Participants read instead of listen.\u000b Solution: Briefly dim screen after explanation to refocus on you.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—you now see the journey from Day 1 to day 5.

To this?\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nHeritage Brick/Stone House With Courtyard\nModern Concrete Block Housing\n09:05 - 09:10 – Reframe Opening (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  • Prompt learners to question current practices before diving into details.\n\nSetup:\n  • Physical arrangement – screen remains visible; trainer stands beside it.\n  • Materials needed – slide loaded; pointer or cursor ready.\n  • Pre-activity checks – confirm image is clear and subtitle is readable.\n\nFacilitator Script:\n  “Take a look at these two buildings.  \n   One was built recently, quickly, often hot and leaky.  \n   The other grew from centuries of wisdom—cool courtyards, thick walls, deep eaves.  \n   Why did we choose speed over wisdom?  \n   What did we lose when we rebuilt in haste?”\n\nKey Points:\n  1. Building style reflects our values and needs.  \n  2. Heritage designs solved local climate and social needs.  \n  3. Today we seek to recover that lost wisdom.\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  Step 1: Ask learners to pair up and name one feature they notice in each image (2 min).  \n  Step 2: Invite 2–3 volunteers to share their observations (1 min).  \n  Step 3: Highlight links between their observations and local climate challenges (2 min).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Issue: Learners focus only on aesthetics.  \n    Solution: Prompt them: “How does that feature help you stay cool or dry?”  \n  • Issue: Discussion drifts to unrelated topics.  \n    Solution: Gently steer back: “Let’s tie it to ‘why rebuild’ before ‘how rebuild.’”\n\nTransition:\n  “Now that we’ve asked ‘why,’ let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker on insulation…”  \n13\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of this design?\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n09:05 - 09:10 – Reframe Opening (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  • Get participants to think in first principles and to think about the person’s lived experience.\n\n14\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of this design?\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n09:05 - 09:10 – Reframe Opening (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  • Get participants to think in first principles and to think about the person’s lived experience.\n15\n\nWet Walls in Winter - Leads to mould\nMosul’s Double-Pain\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nQuick solutions \nCopied designs without understanding\nLost connection to environment\n\nResult: \nHomes like ovens that mould in the winter\n\n\"Deliberateness is from Allah, and haste is from the Ash-shaitan.\" \nJami` at-Tirmidhi 2012 - Prophet Muhammed(s)\nقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم\n  الأَنَاةُ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَالْعَجَلَةُ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ\nIntense Heat in Summer\n09:20 - 09:25 – Expand Problems (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  • Show how rebuilding fast created new problems, so learners see why careful design matters.\n\nSetup:\n  • Physical arrangement – participants facing screen; trainer centre.\n  • Materials needed – projector, pointer ready.\n  • Pre-activity checks – ensure images and click-controlled bullets work.\n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “Let’s ground ourselves again in Mosul’s two pains:  \n     • Mid-July rooftops at 49 °C…  \n     • Winter mould eating into walls.”  \n     (Pause 5 s for silent observation.)\n  2. “Turn to your neighbour and share one word: how does that feel?”  \n     (30 s pair share.)\n  3. “Thank you. Now click to reveal why this happened so quickly.”  \n     *(Click 1 → shows “Quick solutions after war”)*  \n     “After conflict, speed was king—build fast, patch fast.”  \n     *(Click 2 → “Copied designs without understanding”)*  \n     “Many designs were copied from elsewhere without studying local needs.”  \n     *(Click 3 → “Lost connection to climate”)*  \n     “We forgot the climate wisdom built into heritage homes—shade, mass, airflow.”  \n     *(Click 4 → “Result: Suffering families”)*  \n     “The outcome? Families face heat, damp, high costs, and health risks.”\n\nKey Points:\n  1. Fast fixes often ignore context.  \n  2. Copy-paste design hurts people.  \n  3. True progress uses local climate wisdom.\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  Step 1: In pairs, pick the bullet that surprises you most (1 min).  \n  Step 2: One pair shares their choice and why (1 min).  \n  Step 3: Trainer highlights a real Mosul example briefly (1 min).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Issue: Bullets appear too fast.  \n    Solution: Pause after each click and ask “Why might that happen?”  \n  • Issue: Discussion goes off-topic.  \n    Solution: Gently steer back: “Let’s link it to climate impacts.”\n\nTransition:\n  “Great.

If you haven’t already, please open the Generator Cost Calculator sheet in your workbook now.”\n(Pause for 15 s while participants open the sheet.)\n“Every breeze we save with passive cooling translates into less generator run-time—and big IQD savings.”\n“Here’s the basic math: local generators run at about 12 000 IQD per amp per month. If your cooling load draws 15 amps, that’s 12 000 × 15…”\n(Point to “12 000” then “15” on the slide.)\n“…for a total of 180 000 IQD per month.”\n“In practice, families powering multiple rooms often hit much more than that monthly just on fuel. That’s why reducing even a few amps with passive design immediately pays off.”\n“Quick show of hands: who guessed more than 180 000 IQD? Who guessed less? Great—that variation shows how big the stakes are.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\n12 000 IQD/amp-month is our unit cost.\nMultiplying by amps gives your monthly bill.\nSmall amp savings scale to large IQD reductions.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In one Mosul household, cutting just 3 amps via a small courtyard saved 36 000 IQD monthly, and it’s not just a financial return on investment, they also have a view!.”\nTransition ::\u000b “Now that we’ve seen the cash impact on paper, let’s do a hands-on demo: measure a real ΔT on our incense tower, plug it into the same formula in your cost calculator sheet, and calculate your own savings.”\n21\n\nCreative Heating & Cooling \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nYour ΔT ↔ IQD Savings\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nCreative passive solutions that work on first principles can solve both heating and cooling problems\n[10:30 – 10:45 Hands-On Demo: ΔT Cost Math (15 min)]\nPurpose:\u000b Have participants measure a temperature drop (ΔT) in our shoebox tower and convert it into real IQD savings.\nSetup:\nDemo tables with one incense-tower model per group.\nIR gun for each team.\nWhiteboard with formula template:\nΔT (°C) ×  Amp-savings  × 12 000 IQD = IQD/mo saved\nMarkers and eraser.\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify each incense stick lights reliably.\nConfirm IR guns are set to surface-mode.\nWhiteboard marker is fresh.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Each group, light your incense tower and let it run for 30 seconds. Use the IR gun to capture the top-and-bottom temperature difference—your ΔT in °C.”\n“Now, on your whiteboard, write down your ΔT value.”\n“Next, estimate how many amps of generator load that ΔT equates to—let’s assume 1 °C drop ≈ 1 amp of cooling load saved.”\n“Finally, multiply: ΔT × 12 000 IQD. That’s your monthly IQD savings from this passive effect.”\nActivity Instructions:\nMeasure ΔT\nStart incense, wait 30 s, record Hot and Cool IR readings.\nCompute ΔT = Hot − Cool.\u000b\nEstimate Amp Savings\nUse 1 °C → 1 amp rule of thumb.\u000b\nCalculate IQD Savings\nΔT × 12 000 IQD = Your group’s monthly fuel cost reduction.\u000b\nShare\nOne volunteer from each group calls out their number and sticks it on the board.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Smoke too faint → IR gun misreads.\nSolution: Reposition stick or use a fresh incense.\u000b\nIssue: Amp-rule confusion.\nSolution: Remind: “We’re using 1 °C = 1 amp for this demo.”\u000b\nTransition:\n“Fantastic—those savings are real!

Here’s our shoebox model: incense at the bottom represents sun-warmed air. Watch as the smoke rises up the chimney and pulls fresh air in from below.”  \n*(Light incense, place in base, pause 10–15 s.)*  \n“Notice the continuous flow: as warm air exits, it draws cooler air in through the hole. That’s exactly how heritage courtyards in Mosul stayed comfortable.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. **Stack effect** moves warm air upward naturally.  \n2. **Air exchange** draws in cooler ambient air at the base.  \n3. **Zero energy**—relies solely on buoyancy and pressure difference.  \n\nInvestigation ::\n- **Buoyancy:** Warm air is lighter, so it rises.  \n- **Pressure difference:** Exiting air creates suction at the base.  \n- **Continuous flow:** Sustains ventilation without fans.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In a recent Mosul retrofit, adding a 3 m courtyard shaft yielded a **4 °C drop** indoors—enough to run without generators for much of the afternoon.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Observe the smoke path—note where it rises and where air enters.  \nStep 2: In your mind, map these openings onto a real courtyard or window design.  \nStep 3: Think of one way to scale this effect up for a room or roof vent system.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: **Smoke too faint to follow.**  \n• Solution: Use a fresh incense stick; dim room lights briefly.  \nIssue: **Participants focus only on smoke, not airflow.**  \n• Solution: Ask, “Where does the new air come from?” while pointing to the base hole.\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that we’ve seen how passive ventilation works, let’s turn those cool-air flows into real IQD savings on generator fuel.”  \n23\n\nWhat Is Green Building?\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🌍 Planet\n“Low-impact materials”\n“Energy ↓, carbon ↓”\n👥 People\n“Healthy indoor air”\n“Comfort & well-being”\n💰 Profit\n“Lower operating costs”\n“Higher asset value”\nExamples in Iraq: \nBabylon Green University LEED campus (In development)\n[10:30 - 10:40] – What Is Green Building?

You see here the three pillars:\n🌍 Planet: we choose materials and systems to cut waste and carbon.\n👥 People: healthy air and comfortable spaces matter as much as efficiency.\n💰 Profit: lower bills and stronger resale value keep projects viable.\n\nIn Iraq, we’re already seeing this in action. The Baghdad Green Zone pedestrian lighting uses solar-powered fixtures, and Babylon’s Green University campus is LEED-certified—proof that theoretical benefits translate into real-world impact.\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Green building isn’t just “eco.” It balances environmental, social, and economic gains.\n2. Health and comfort drive user satisfaction—never overlook the people pillar.\n3. Financial returns (energy savings, higher valuation) win over even the toughest budget guard.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In Mosul’s reconstruction, small solar street-lights in public squares reduced generator use by 70 %—that’s planet + people + profit at work.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Turn to your neighbor and name one green-building item you’ve seen locally (1 min).\nStep 2: We’ll ask three pairs to share one quick example. (3 × 30 s)\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: “Too abstract—what counts as ‘green’?”  \nSolution: Point to clear, tangible examples (solar lamps, LEED buildings).\n\nIssue: “Profit doesn’t seem ‘green.’”  \nSolution: Emphasize that long-term savings free budgets for future projects.\n\nTransition ::\n“Great examples!

Based on what we just saw about green building’s planet, people, and profit benefits, I want each of you to think of one ‘pain’ that you or someone you know faces in your home or work site—something this approach could solve.”\n\n“When I ring the bell, three volunteers will share one pain each, in one sentence. Ready?”  \n*(Ring bell)*  \n“Who’d like to go first?”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Link abstract benefits to concrete, personal frustrations.  \n2. Encourage brief, one-sentence shares to keep energy high.  \n3. Highlight diversity of pains—thermal discomfort, high bills, mould, etc.\n\nLocal example ::\n“One trainee might say, ‘I hate waking up sweating because my room feels like an oven,’ which ties directly to our cooling-load discussions.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Participants think silently for 30 seconds.  \nStep 2: Ring bell – Volunteer 1 shares their pain (max 20 s).  \nStep 3: Ring bell – Volunteer 2 shares (20 s).  \nStep 4: Ring bell – Volunteer 3 shares (20 s).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Long-winded responses →  \nSolution: Gently interject: “Great point—let’s hear it in one sentence.”  \nIssue: No one volunteers →  \nSolution: Call on a confident participant: “Ali, how about you?”  \n\nTransition :\n“Thanks for those honest shares—they remind us why green-building matters.

Ready? 3–2–1… GO!”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. **Accuracy matters:** Call out the number you measured.  \n2. **Speed counts:** First to shout gets the win.  \n3. **Celebrate data:** Reinforce the value of measuring performance.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In one of our pilot sessions, a team shouted ‘8 °C!’—that matched our courtyard case study and blew everyone away.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer counts down 3–2–1.  \n2. Teams shout their ΔT simultaneously.  \n3. Trainer rings bell for the quickest correct answer.  \n4. Award snack to that team; acknowledge the group’s results.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: Multiple teams shout same number at once.  \n  Solution: Ring bell and ask those teams to raise hands; pick one randomly.  \n• Issue: Incorrect ΔT shouted.  \n  Solution: Ask for a show of hands from teams with the actual reading; confirm before awarding.\n\nTransition ::\n“Great energy—let’s carry that momentum into our morning session but before that, let’s jump to daily agenda !”  \n47\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\n[09:45–09:50] – Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n48\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat. \u000bUse IR cameras & empathy maps to find and explain pain.\n2\nMaterials & Trust\nExplore what works for Mosul.

Some are heritage-inspired and ideal for Mosul’s heat; others look great on Instagram but waste energy. At your table, each person grabs one card, reads it aloud, and—based on Day 2’s Ihsân principle—decides if it Works for Mosul or Doesn’t Work. Place it on the corresponding sheet.”\u000b (Demonstrate with one sample card.)\u000b “I’ll signal when you’re halfway through and again at 10 minutes.”\nKey Points:\nContext is king: A feature is only good if it fits Mosul’s climate and culture.\nBeauty + benefit: Thumbs-up for solutions that are both elegant and practical.\nRapid consensus: Aim for quick, data-informed decisions based on what you’ve learned.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “A carved mashrabiya screen gives lovely patterns of light and shade while allowing airflow—perfect for Mosul.”\nActivity Instructions:\nPick a card (5 s).\nDiscuss its merits vs. drawbacks (15 s).\nPlace it on “Works” or “Doesn’t Work” (5 s).\nRotate roles so each team member sorts at least three cards.\nReview remaining cards together if time allows.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nDisagreement on a card? → Prompt: “Which first principle does it address—or violate?”\nCards fall off chart? → Use extra tape or move to a sturdier board.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great sorting!

On the left you see heavy materials—brick, stone, concrete—that store heat by day and release it slowly at night. On the right are lightweight insulators—foam boards, fiberglass, aerogel—that block heat transfer altogether.”\u000b (Point down each column.)\u000b “Thermal mass is ideal in climates with large day–night swings—like Mosul’s desert fringe—while insulation excels when you need a strong barrier against continuous sun.”\nKey Points ::\nThermal Mass: Dampens temperature swings by storing heat.\nInsulation: Resists heat flow, keeping interiors cooler continuously.\nTrade-off: Mass is heavy and slow to respond; insulation performs instantly but can degrade.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul, thick brick walls can reduce indoor highs by 4–6 °C after sunset, whereas under-roof insulation keeps afternoon peaks 2–3 °C lower.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPair up with a neighbor and choose one material from each column.\nDiscuss briefly (3 min) which you’d prioritize for Ahmed’s roof and why.\nShare one team’s choice and rationale with the full group (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nConfusing storage vs. blocking? → Ask, “Does this material hold heat so it’s released later, or stop it from coming in?”\nWondering about availability? → Prompt: “Which option can Ahmed source locally—brick or foam?”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent—keep those distinctions in mind. Next, we’ll quantify these effects with our Heat-Gain Demo: Glass vs Shade.”\n56\n\nHeat-Gain Demo: Acrylic “Glass” vs. Cardboard “Mashrabiya”\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nZone\nIR Temp (°C)\nA: Acrylic\n______\nB: Shade\n______\nΔT =\nA – B = __ °C\n“Every 1 °C reduction ≈ X Wh cooling saved”\n10:40–10:55 – Heat-Gain Demo: Glass vs. Shade (15 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Quantify how much extra solar heat a clear glass surface adds compared to traditional shaded treatments.\nSetup:\u000b • Place two sample zones side-by-side on the demo table under a desk lamp.\u000b • Participants remain seated in small groups around the table.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Clear acrylic panel (“glass”)\u000b • Cardboard mashrabiya model (“shade”)\u000b • Adjustable desk lamp\u000b • IR gun\u000b • Tape measure or ruler to set lamp height\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Position the lamp exactly 15 cm above both samples.\u000b • Warm up the IR gun and set to surface-temperature mode.\u000b • Confirm participants can see both zones clearly.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s put our material choices to the test. We have two zones: Zone A is clear acrylic, and Zone B is our cardboard mashrabiya shade. First, I’ll switch on the lamp and let both surfaces heat for 30 seconds—just enough for them to reach a steady state.”\u000b (Turn on lamp; wait 30 s.)\u000b “Okay, let’s record temperatures. Pair up: one of you points the IR gun; the other reads aloud.”\nDemo Steps:\nMeasure Zone A (glass) (1 min):\u000b “Aim at the surface, hold steady, and call out the temperature for Zone A.”\nMeasure Zone B (shade) (1 min):\u000b “Now switch to Zone B and record that reading.”\nCalculate ΔT (1 min):\u000b “On our slide table, write ΔT = Temp_A – Temp_B. That difference shows how much extra heat the glass traps.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\nSolar penalty: Glass traps more heat, raising surface temperature.\nShade benefit: Simple overhangs or lattice can cut ΔT significantly.\nEnergy link: Every 1 °C reduction equates to roughly X Wh of cooling energy saved.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our pilot workshop, glass surfaces heated to nearly 65 °C, while shaded models stayed around 50 °C—ΔT of 15 °C translates into hundreds of watts saved.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nLamp on for consistent heating (30 s).\nRecord Zone A temp (20 s).\nRecord Zone B temp (20 s).\nCompute and announce ΔT (40 s).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nLamp drifts: Tape its base or clamp it in place.\nIR gun misreads reflections: Aim slightly off-axis at a matte spot.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—now that you’ve seen the numbers, let’s shift to how you’ll source these solutions locally with our Supplier Ecosystem overview.”\n57\n\nSupplier Ecosystem Map\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMaterial\nSupplier Type\nExample Vendor\nLocation\nClay Bricks\nBrickworks\nGypsum Plaster\nGypsum Plant\nLimestone Blocks\nQuarry\nTimber Lattice\nCarpentry Workshop\nMashrabiya Screens\nWoodcarving Studio\nReflective Coatings\nPaint Supplier\n10:55–11:05 – Supplier Ecosystem Map (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show teams where and how to source every material and craft element they’ve just learned about.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the “Supplier Ecosystem Map” slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants seated with their notebooks open.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Printed list of local supplier contacts\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the table is fully visible and legible.\u000b • Ensure any printed contact lists are at the side table.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we know which materials and patterns we need, here’s how you actually get them. On screen is a snapshot of Mosul’s supplier ecosystem: brickworks, gypsum factories, quarries, woodcarvers, and paint vendors. Each row shows a material, the type of supplier, an example vendor, and their location.”\n(Point row by row.)\u000b “For example, Mosul Clay Co. in the Old City produces high-density clay bricks, while Al-Rashid Woodworks specializes in intricate lattice screens. You’ll build relationships with these local experts to ensure authenticity, quality, and faster lead times.”\nKey Points ::\nLocal sourcing reduces cost and supports the community.\nSpecialized craftspeople maintain heritage quality (e.g., mashrabiya carving).\nProximity matters: closer suppliers mean faster delivery and lower transport energy.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our pilot, teams who partnered with the Nineveh Gypsum Factory secured custom plaster mixes in half the usual lead time.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nChoose one material from your design and note its supplier type.\nWrite down the example vendor and their location in your notebook.\nDiscuss with your neighbor which supplier you’d contact first and why (3 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Uncertain which supplier fits a custom order.\u000b → Solution: Encourage calling the workshop; many will handle small bespoke runs.\nIssue: Vendor contact info missing.\u000b → Solution: Use the printed list or ask workshop staff for introductions.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent—now let’s take a 30-minute break.

Hands Up!”\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\n[09:25–09:35] Ice-Breaker: “R or U? Hands Up!” (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Get everyone energized and cement the distinction between R-value (insulation) and U-value (conductance) before our deep dive.\nSetup:\u000b Participants remain in their seats or stand in a semi-circle. No materials required.\nMaterials needed:\u000b None.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b Ensure everyone can see the two icons on screen and understands “right = R, left = U.”\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Alright everyone, let’s play ‘R or U? Hands Up!’ I’ll read a quick statement about a material or scenario. If you think it’s about R-value (resisting heat), raise your right hand. If it’s about U-value (letting heat through), raise your left hand. Simple? Let’s test it!”\nStatements (call 6–8):\n“A thick wool blanket in winter.”\n“A single-pane glass window at midday.”\n“A dense cork under a roof slab.”\n“An uninsulated metal roof in July.”\n“A high-performance foam panel.”\n“A thin aluminum sheet.”\n(After each, pause 3 s to let hands go up, then “Right hands! Yes, wool blankets resist heat—R-value.

Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n79\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat.

U-value is the inverse: it’s the rate of heat transfer per square meter per degree—so lower is better.\nYou’ll see on the slide:\nR = m²·K / W  U = W / m²·K\nAnd a quick reminder: Convert cm → m before using the formula—for example, that 3 cm cork sample is 0.03 m thick.”\u000b (Point to the “0.03 m thickness” icon.)\nKey Points ::\nR = thickness ÷ λ (units m²·K/W)\nU = 1 ÷ R (units W/m²·K)\nAlways convert your thickness into meters first.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul, a 3 cm cork panel (λ ≈ 0.04 W/m·K) gives R ≈ 0.75 m²·K/W—compare that to 1 cm foam (λ ≈ 0.025) which is only R ≈ 0.4.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPass the three samples down each row—feel thickness and spot differences.\nOn the whiteboard, write R = thickness / λ using meters (e.g., 0.03 m / 0.04). Calculate R together.\nInvert that R value to get U, and record it beside your formula.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nConfusing cm vs. m? → Always divide cm by 100 before plugging into R = thickness/λ.\nThinking higher U is better? → Remind: U measures leakiness—lower is more resistant.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—we can now quantify insulation performance. Next, let’s explore typical R-values in common building materials.”\n83\n\nR-Value Table - Common Building Materials\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:55–10:00] – R-Value Table (5 min)\nPurpose : Show the spectrum of insulation performance so teams can choose materials strategically.\nSetup : Project a clear table of 8–10 common materials and their R-values. Leave space on whiteboard for jotting examples.\nMaterials needed : Printed handout or projected slide of R-Value table (foam, cork, brick, concrete, wood, PIR, XPS, EPS).\nPre-activity checks : Ensure everyone can read the smallest font; confirm marker works for whiteboard notes.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Now that we know how to calculate R and U, let’s see real values for materials you’ll actually work with. This table shows R-value per material—higher resistivity means better insulation. Take a moment to scan through and think which ones fit Mosul’s climate and budget.”\nKey Points :\nLightweight foams and PIR/XPS panels have R ≈ 3–6 m²·K/W.\nTraditional materials (brick, stone) sit below R 1 m²·K/W.\nWood and cork are mid-range (R ≈ 1–2 m²·K/W) but offer heritage appeal.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “A 10 cm layer of expanded polystyrene (EPS) gives you around R 2.8—similar to a 15 cm thick traditional mashrabiya wall, but at half the thickness.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, pick two materials—one “high R” and one “low R”—and write their R-values on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 2: Debate which you’d specify for a sun-facing wall vs. an interior partition.\u000b Step 3: Volunteer teams share their choices (1 min each) and rationale.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing material thickness vs. R-value.\u000b Solution: Remind: table is already normalized to standard thickness. Focus on relative performance.\nIssue: Assuming “best R” always wins.\u000b Solution: Emphasize trade-offs: cost, heritage look, moisture risk.\nTransition :\u000b “Great discussion—next we’ll flip these R-values into U-values so you can compare whole assemblies.”\n84\n\nU-Value Table\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[10:00–10:05] – U-Value Table (5 min)\nPurpose : Reinforce the inverse relationship between resistance and conductance so teams grasp why U-value matters in real assemblies.\nSetup : Project the U-Value table slide and leave room on the whiteboard to jot sample calculations. Arrange participants so they can see both screen and board.\nMaterials needed : Projected slide of U-Value table; whiteboard and marker.\nPre-activity checks : Verify slide is legible from back row; confirm whiteboard marker writes clearly.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Here we flip R on its head: U-value tells us how much heat passes through per square meter per degree difference. Lower U means less heat gain. Take a moment to scan: you’ll notice traditional brick sits around U 0.8, while Thermostone is down at U 0.2—four times better.”\nKey Points :\nU = 1/R, so doubling R halves U.\nDense materials like concrete block have high U (≈1.3–1.5).\nSpecialty insulators (Thermostone) can achieve U <0.3 despite light weight.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 30 cm solid brick wall (U ≈0.85) will let roughly three times more heat inside than a 10 cm Thermostone panel (U ≈0.21).”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, choose two materials from the table—one high U and one low U—and calculate the ratio of their heat gains (e.g. 0.85 ÷ 0.21 ≈ 4).\u000b Step 2: Write your ratio and material names on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 3: One pair volunteers to explain why that ratio matters for selecting sun-facing walls.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing U and R units.\u000b Solution: Remind: R in m²·K/W resists heat; U in W/m²·K conducts heat. Higher U = more heat leak.\nIssue: Thinking density improves insulation.\u000b Solution: Emphasize: density affects thermal mass, not directly conduction—focus on U-values for insulation decisions.\nTransition :\u000b “Great insight—next, we’ll see these differences in action under our heat lamp and confirm the numbers with IR readings.”\n85\n\nLow solar gain, low daylight\nGlazing Ratios: Getting It Right\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Schematics of Façade A: 20% Glazing (small window area)\n*Schematics of Façade B: 40% Glazing (moderate window area)\n*Schematics of Façade C: 60% Glazing (large window area)\nBalanced daylight & thermal control\nHigh daylight, high cooling load\n10:05–10:15 – Glazing Ratios: Getting It Right (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Help teams choose appropriate window-to-wall ratios to balance daylighting benefits against cooling penalties.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain seated, sketchbooks or notebooks ready.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Handouts of a façade template for quick sketches\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the three façade graphics and percentages are clear from all seats.\u000b • Verify participants have a pen or pencil for sketching if desired.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Next, let’s tackle glazing ratios—the percentage of your wall that’s glass. Too little, and you lose daylight; too much, and you bake your interior. On screen are three examples:\n20% glazing gives minimal solar gain but also poor daylighting.\n40% glazing hits a balanced sweet spot—good light with manageable cooling loads.\n60% glazing floods the room with light but drives up air-conditioning use dramatically.\u000b In Mosul’s summer, we generally aim for 30–45% glazing to optimize both comfort and energy.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\nLow glazing (<25%) = low solar gain but dim interiors.\nModerate glazing (30–45%) = good daylight with tolerable heat gain.\nHigh glazing (>50%) = bright, but high cooling loads and glare.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our Mosul retrofit, a 40% glazing retrofit with shade fins dropped peak indoor temperatures by 3 °C compared to a previous 60% cut-and-paste glass façade.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nSketch on your notebook one façade with ~35% glazing (2 min).\nDiscuss with your neighbor: what shading detail would you add to that ratio? (3 min)\nVolunteer one idea to the group. (2 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nMisestimating percentages? → Use the façade template handout and lightly pencil shading to count grid squares.\nFocusing only on daylight? → Remind: “Every 1% glazing above 45% can add up to X W/m² of solar gain.”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—now that we know how to size our openings, let’s turn to our next slide: Building Trust Through Accuracy, where we’ll set clear cooling-load targets.”\n86\n\nPresent real numbers—accurate data earns client trust.\nBuilding Trust Through Accuracy\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nIntervention\nCooling Load (W/m²)\nTarget\nUnshaded concrete wall\n~300\n🚫 too high\nInsulated wall (10 cm EPS)\n~200\n✓ acceptable\nCourtyard-shaded wall or overhang\n~100\n★ ideal\n10:15–10:25 – Building Trust Through Accuracy (Cooling-Load Targets)\nPurpose:\u000b Show how setting clear cooling-load targets (in W/m²) and sharing them honestly with clients builds credibility and trust.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain at their seats with notebooks.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Printed “target sheet” for quick reference\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the table and icons are legible.\u000b • Ensure participants have a pen and can sketch if they wish.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we understand how to size our glazing and materials, let’s talk accuracy. Clients value real data. On screen are three representative cooling-load figures for Mosul:\nAn unshaded concrete wall runs around 300 W/m², which is prohibitive.\nAdding 10 cm of EPS insulation brings it down to 200 W/m², an acceptable level.\nA courtyard-shaded wall or well-designed overhang achieves 100 W/m², our ideal target.\u000b\nWhen you present these numbers clearly, you earn your client’s trust—because you’re honest about performance and realistic about outcomes.”\nKey Points ::\nQuantified targets: Share W/m² goals for each intervention.\nBenchmarking: Show “too high,” “acceptable,” and “ideal” zones.\nAccuracy = Trust: Clients respect data-driven transparency.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In a recent Mosul retrofit, we showed homeowners the simulated cooling loads: they switched from an initial 280 W/m² design to a courtyard solution hitting 95 W/m²—and signed the contract on the spot.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPair up and pick one intervention from the table.\nSketch (in words) how you’d explain its W/m² target to a client in under 15 seconds. (3 min)\nVolunteer one pair to deliver their client-brief tagline.

Do they follow best practices?\nOrganization: Look at site logistics—are materials staged logically? Is waste managed?”\u000b\n(Point to each checkbox as you speak.)\nKey Points ::\nHolistic view: Good buildings start with good materials and methods.\nPeople matter: Skilled, organized crews deliver better outcomes.\nSite order: Efficient site organization reduces errors and waste.\u000b\nActivity Instructions ::\nReview each checklist category silently (1 min).\nDiscuss with your neighbor one thing you’ve seen in past projects under any category (3 min).\nWe’ll apply this guide tomorrow—be ready to fill in your own observations.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nOverwhelmed by detail? → Focus on one category at a time, rotating your attention every 30 seconds.\nMissing context? → Ask site supervisors “Why do you stage materials here?” to understand organization choices.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—keep that guide in mind.

Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s we go to daily agenda.”  \n108\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\n[09:25–09:30] Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context.

Second question: Which proof style—Visual, Numbers, Stories, or Experience—converts which type of client mind?”\nPrompt groups to shout out matches, then clarify.\n“Great—those two pillars (accuracy and proof-style matching) are the foundation for today’s work.”\u000b\nKey Points :\nComparative BOQ accuracy—clients trust clear, error-free numbers.\nFour proof types—match proof to client mindset to persuade effectively.\nLocal example :\u000b “In Mosul, one contractor’s error-free BOQ cut follow-up questions by 60 %, and showing a sample demo (✋ Experience) won over hands-on skeptical clients.”\nActivity Instructions :\nStep 1 (3 min): Groups discuss and prepare one concise answer to each question.\nStep 2 (4 min): One representative per group shares their answers; trainer writes top phrases on the board.\nStep 3 (3 min): Trainer synthesizes responses into two summary sentences.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Participants struggle to recall exact terms.\u000b Solution: Prompt: “Think back to our Good/Better/Best table and the eye, number, book, hand icons.”\nIssue: Discussion drifts into new topics.\u000b Solution: Refocus: “We’re only recapping two Day 4 essentials—let’s stay on those.”\u000b\nTransition :\u000b “Fantastic recap! Now let’s address any lingering ‘Yesterday’s Questions’ before we dive into Presentation Craft.”\n132\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nYesterday’s Questions \nQ1: …\nQ2: …\nQ3: …\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n[09:50 – 10:00] Yesterday’s Questions Answered (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\nClarify top reflections and ensure everyone starts Day 5 with common understanding.\n\nSetup:\n• Participants seated, facing the Q-Wall summary slide.\n• Trainer stands near the screen with a mic or pointer.\n\nMaterials needed:\n• Slide “Yesterday’s Top 3 Questions & Answers.”\n• Mic or clicker to advance bullets.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n• Confirm slide loads correctly.\n• Ensure audio level (if using mic) is set.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Before we move on, let’s dive into the top three questions you posted on our Reflection Wall yesterday. We’ll read each, give a concise answer, and then pause for one quick follow-up if needed.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Reinforce key rules (flash-round timing).  \n2. Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker:!”  \n133\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n[09:20 – 09:25] Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n134\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat.

Open your model, toggle the courtyard void layer on, and draw a 50 m² wall extrusion on the sun-facing façade—your ‘sun-wall.’ Be precise: it should measure 10 m wide by 5 m tall (or equivalent configuration), for a total area of 50 m². Once you’ve got it, take a clean screenshot and name the file TeamYourNumber_Mass.png. Ready? Your 15 minutes starts now.”\nKey Points\nAccuracy: 50 m² exact—model grid snapping helps.\nVisibility: Ensure the courtyard void remains visible for context.\nNaming: Use the exact filename convention for easy collection.\u000b\nLocal example\u000b “In last month’s hackathon, one team mis-sized their wall by 10 % and saw a proportional error in their ROI—so double-check your dimensions now.”\nActivity Instructions\nOpen the Mosul massing file and toggle “courtyard ON.”\nDraw or extrude your sun-wall to total 50 m².\nOrbit the camera for a clear orthographic view.\nScreenshot and save as Team#_Mass.png.\nUpload to the shared folder when done.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nMis-scaled wall: Remind: “Use grid snap or input exact dimensions.”\nLayer hidden: Prompt: “Check your Layers panel—courtyard ON.”\u000b\nTransition\u000b “When your screenshot is saved, get ready for Sprint Task 2: running that mass through Ladybug to extract your annual kWh savings.”\n146\n\nTask 2: Ladybug Simulation\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🏷️ Toggle your “sun-wall” layer + load Mosul_HOURLY.epw\n▶️ Run Annual Cooling simulation\n📊 Locate baseline vs retrofit kWh/year\n📸 Screenshot summary panel as Team#_kWh.png\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n[11:40 – 12:05] – Sprint Task 2: Ladybug Simulation (15 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Quantify annual cooling energy savings for your sun-wall mass so teams can translate design moves into kWh metrics.\nSetup:\nTeams at Rhino/Grasshopper workstations with their mass model loaded.\nTrainer computer projecting one live run for reference.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nRhino + Grasshopper with Ladybug plugin installed\nMosul_HOURLY.epw weather file available in each project folder\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify each team’s model has the “sun-wall” extrusion baked and visible.\nConfirm the Ladybug “Run Annual Analysis” component is connected.\nEnsure the weather file path is correct in each Grasshopper definition.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now that we have our 3D mass, let’s see its real-world performance. In Grasshopper, toggle on your ‘sun-wall’ geometry, load the Mosul_HOURLY.epw weather file into the Ladybug Annual Energy component, and hit ‘Run.’ It’ll take about 1–2 minutes to generate your cooling-load report. When it finishes, find the summary panel that shows kWh/year for both baseline and retrofit scenarios. Take a clear screenshot named TeamYourNumber_kWh.png and upload it.”\nKey Points:\nConsistent Setup: Everyone must use the same weather file for fair comparison.\nLayer Accuracy: Only the “sun-wall” difference should drive the kWh delta.\nClear Export: Ensure axes and legend are visible in your screenshot.\u000b\nActivity Instructions:\nToggle your “sun-wall” layer ON in Rhino.\nLoad Mosul_HOURLY.epw into the Ladybug component (2 min).\nRun the annual simulation (5 min).\nCompare baseline vs retrofit kWh (4 min).\nScreenshot and save as instructed (4 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nSimulation fails: Check that all geometry is baked/internalized in Grasshopper.\nWeather file missing: Download from the shared drive and reload.\nUI clutter: Collapse unused panels so the summary graph is clear.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great—now that you’ve captured your annual kWh savings, let’s move on to Sprint Task 3: filling out your ROI sheet to convert those kWh into IQD/year savings.”\n147\n\nTask 3: ROI Sheet\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n📊 Inputs: Baseline & Retrofit kWh/year\n⚡ Tariff: 500 IQD/kWh\n➗ ΔkWh: Baseline − Retrofit\n✖️ IQD/yr: ΔkWh × 500 IQD\n📝 Enter values in ROI template\n📸 Screenshot your filled sheet as Team#_ROI.png\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n[12:05 – 12:15] – Sprint Task 3: ROI Sheet 10 min\nPurpose:\u000b Translate your annual energy savings into clear monetary value (IQD/year) so every design choice speaks directly to the client’s wallet.\nSetup:\nTeams at their laptops with the “Courtyard-ROI.xlsx” or “Sprint-ROI.xlsx” open.\nTrainer computer projecting a completed example ROI sheet.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nROI Excel template pre-loaded.\nCalculator (optional) for manual checks.\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nEnsure the tariff cell is set to 500 IQD/kWh (or current local rate).\nConfirm each team’s kWh screenshot is saved and accessible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “You’ve just captured baseline and retrofit kWh/year from Ladybug. Now let’s convert that delta into IQD: subtract retrofit from baseline to get ΔkWh, then multiply by the tariff—500 IQD per kWh. Enter those numbers into your ROI template. When your sheet auto-calculates your annual savings, take a clean screenshot named TeamYourNumber_ROI.png and upload it.”\nKey Points:\nΔkWh accuracy: Subtract retrofit kWh from baseline precisely.\nTariff consistency: Always use the same rate for fair comparison.\nAuto-calculation: Trust the spreadsheet formula but spot-check one row manually.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, cutting just 1 000 kWh saves 500 000 IQD per year—enough to cover a month’s groceries.”\nActivity Instructions:\nOpen your ROI template (1 min).\nPaste your baseline & retrofit kWh values (2 min).\nConfirm ΔkWh and multiply by 500 IQD (3 min).\nScreenshot the filled ROI summary (4 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nFormula broken: Re-enter the tariff cell or copy the working formula from the example.\nScreenshot shows gridlines: Collapse grid view or zoom in on the summary box.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent—now you have your annual savings in IQD.

With just two small grants, she and her team restored two of the four historic qunatra, reviving stone arches and community pride against all odds.”\n  “Next is Wifaq—a civil engineer who applied a simple, heritage-inspired cork render to his family’s home. He measured a **17 °C drop** indoors—enough that his children moved off the blistering rooftop and back upstairs, and that generator fuel bills fell sharply.”\n  “Finally, Laith always says, ‘Trust is our currency in Mosul.’ By delivering one exceptional heritage retrofit, he earns ten new referrals—proving that empathy and technical rigor travel hand-in-hand.”\n  “By the end of this week, you’ll have the tools to slash heat, boost comfort, and build trust—just like Fatima, Wifaq, and Laith.”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. Local Leadership: Small, community-driven projects can transform public space (Fatima).  \n  2. Tangible Results: Simple materials deliver measurable comfort gains (Wifaq).  \n  3. Emotional ROI: Empathy-driven quality work multiplies referrals (Laith).\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In 2024, another Mosul engineer applied that same cork render in a school—students reported falling asleep more comfortably during lessons.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Listen to each story (2 min).  \n  Step 2: Reflect silently: Which story resonates most with you? (1 min)  \n  Step 3: Turn to a neighbor and share your pick in one sentence.

First, we draw a 3 × 3 m wall—area of 9 m². Next, multiply by your planned thickness—0.2 m—so volume is 1.8 m³. Then enter your rate, say 80 000 IQD per cubic meter. Watch: the Sub-total column automatically shows 144 000 IQD. No extra calculator needed—your spreadsheet does the heavy lifting!”\nKey Points:\nArea → Volume: Always multiply area by thickness for volume.\nRate consistency: Use the same unit rate (IQD/m³).\nAuto-calc: Set formulas once—then data entry drives results.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In our Mosul pilot, one team’s 1.8 m³ of mashrabiya screen at 80 000 IQD/m³ cost just 144 000 IQD—easy for clients to compare against their generator bills.”\nActivity Instructions:\nI’ll demo on screen while teams watch (2 min).\nNow over to you: each team picks one BOQ line, draws the area, enters thickness and rate (5 min).\nConfirm your sub-total matches the live demo example (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nFormula errors: Check that your Sub-total cell uses =Rate*Qty.\nUnit mix-ups: Verify you’re using m³ rates for volumetric items, not m² rates.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent—now you’ve seen how BOQ and math tie together.

Sum all Subtotals to get your project’s total material cost.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Mismatched units: If area shows in m² but price is per m³, pause and recalculate volume first.  \n  • Missing prices: Flag any absent rate—use the average from the handout as a placeholder.  \n  • Formula errors: If the Subtotal isn’t populating, check that the cell references match your Qty and Unit Price cells.  \n\nTransition:\n  “Great work—now that you have your full BOQ, let’s convert those energy savings into real IQD figures on our Auto-ROI sheet in Task 4.”  \n176\n\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nTask 4: Auto-ROI Sheet → Yearly IQD\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🧮 Formula Flow\nΔHeat Gain (W/m²) → ΔEnergy (kWh/yr)\nΔEnergy × Tariff (IQD/kWh) = Annual Savings (IQD/yr)\nΔW/m²\nArea (m²)\nΔkWh/yr\nTariff (IQD/kWh)\nSavings (IQD/yr)\n200\n50\n(200×50×24×365)/1000 ≈ 87 600\n500\n43,800,000\n2. 📊 Example Snippet\n💡 Tip: Link your Ladybug kWh output directly into cell B2 for live recalculation\n[12:20–12:30] – Task 4: Auto-ROI Sheet → Yearly IQD (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Convert your simulated energy savings into concrete IQD values to strengthen your financial proposal.\n\nSetup:\n  • Teams remain at laptops with the Auto-ROI spreadsheet open.  \n  • Projector displays the formula snippet slide for reference.  \n\nMaterials needed:\n  • Auto-ROI Excel/Google Sheet with formulas.  \n  • Your Ladybug simulation kWh summary.  \n  • Local tariff handout (IQD/kWh).  \n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm each team’s sheet has ΔkWh/yr and tariff input cells ready.  \n  • Verify tariff value matches today’s market rate (e.g., 500 IQD/kWh).  \n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “On the slide you see how we map ΔW/m² → ΔkWh/year using your Ladybug output. Multiply by your façade area and divide by 1 000 to get annual kWh.”  \n  2. “Next, enter the local energy tariff in IQD per kWh—your sheet will auto-calculate the IQD savings per year.”  \n  3. “This number is essential: it shows clients exactly how much their retrofit saves them on fuel or electricity bills every year.”  \n\nKey Points:\n  1. Direct linkage: Pull your simulation ΔkWh/yr straight into the ROI cell.  \n  2. Live recalculation: Changing the tariff or area instantly updates IQD savings.  \n  3. Clarity: This annual figure anchors your “Ask” in the hook pitch.  \n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Copy your Ladybug ΔkWh/yr into the sheet’s “Energy Savings” cell.  \n  2. Confirm or adjust the tariff cell to today’s IQD/kWh.  \n  3. Review the “Annual Savings” output and note it for your proposal.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Formula error: If savings don’t appear, check that ΔkWh and tariff cells are formatted as numbers.  \n  • Tariff mismatch: If the figure seems too low/high, re-verify the tariff with the handout.  \n\nTransition:\n  “Excellent—now capture that Savings cell and your BOQ table as high-res visuals. In Task 5, you’ll embed them into your proposal deck along with your model screenshot.”  \n177\n\nRhino & Ladybug Teaser – Model Toggle\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n10:45 – 10:50 (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show how easily the courtyard intervention can be toggled on/off in Rhino, priming participants for Day 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)’s digital simulation.\nSetup:\nProjector displaying the full‐screen Rhino viewport screenshot.\nTrainer computer with the Mosul massing file loaded.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nRhino + Ladybug plugin installed.\nSample Mosul house 3D file.\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nConfirm the “courtyard” layer is present and named correctly.\nEnsure Ladybug toolbar is visible in Rhino.\u000b\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Here’s our 3D massing of a typical Mosul home. Notice on the left the solid roof, and on the right the inset courtyard void highlighted. In Rhino, a single click on the ‘courtyard’ layer toggles that void on and off—no complex commands needed. On Day 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع), you’ll each open this exact file, switch the courtyard in Ladybug, and instantly see how airflow and daylight pathways change.”\nKey Points ::\nOne-click toggle isolates the heritage intervention.\nVisual clarity helps link design moves to performance.\nNo coding required—accessible to all skill levels.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In last month’s pilot, trainees mastered this toggle in under two minutes and were able to run their first simulations by lunch.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nObserve the highlighted “courtyard” layer in the screenshot.\nNote how on Day 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع) you’ll repeat this toggle in your own Rhino session.\nPrepare any questions about file organization.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Layer not visible.\u000b Solution: Unlock layers panel or restart Rhino.\nIssue: Ladybug toolbar missing.\u000b Solution: Re-load plugin via Tools → Options → Plugins.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Next, let’s see the payoff of that toggle—how heat‐map overlays shift when the courtyard is on vs. off.”\n178\n\nRhino & Ladybug Teaser – Model Toggle\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Left Panel (“Courtyard OFF”): Heat-map overlay on the 3D roof model showing high surface temperatures in reds and oranges.\n*Right Panel (“Courtyard ON”): Heat-map overlay with more yellows and blues indicating cooler surfaces.\n10:50 – 10:55 (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Visually demonstrate the thermal impact of adding a courtyard by comparing before/after heat‐map overlays.\nSetup:\nProjector showing the side-by-side panels: “Courtyard OFF” vs. “Courtyard ON.”\nTrainer computer ready to animate between the two screenshots.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nLadybug heat-map results exported as PNG.\nSample 3D file with both overlays saved.\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify both images are full-resolution at screen size.\nConfirm the legend and color scale are legible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “On the left is our roof with no courtyard: reds and oranges indicate surface temperatures peaking highest. On the right, the inset courtyard shifts the palette toward yellows and blues—on average about 3 °C cooler across the deck. This comparative view is your proof of concept long before you write a line of code.”\nKey Points ::\nColor shift from red→blue directly maps to temperature drop.\nAverage ΔT ≈ 3 °C shows passive design benefit.\nImmediate visual cue builds confidence in heritage strategies.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “A contractor we worked with used similar overlays to persuade a café owner—she switched from glass walls to a shaded courtyard after seeing a 5 °C drop.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nScan both panels for the coolest and hottest zones.\nNote the approximate ΔT from the color legend.\nJot down one question about the heat-map scale or legend.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Legend text too small.\u000b Solution: Zoom in or adjust projector focus.\nIssue: Colors look washed out.\u000b Solution: Check projector color profile or ambient light.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “With that visual proof in mind, let’s take a break”\n179\n\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nIntro & File-Naming\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🖼️ Gallery Placeholder\n Insert photo: Team#_Ladybug_kWh.png\n Insert screenshot: Team#_SunWallModel.png\n Insert BOQ & ROI visuals: Team#_BOQ.png, Team#_ROI.png\n📁 Filename Conventions\nUse Team<Number>_<ContentType>.<ext>\n\nExamples:\nTeam2_Ladybug_kWh.png\nTeam2_CourtyardROI.png\nTeam2_ProposalDeck.png\n💡 Tip: Export all images ≥ 300 dpi for crisp print and screen sharing.\n[12:30–12:40] – Task 5: Capture High-Res Photos & BIM Screenshot (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Prepare professional-quality visuals for your proposal deck, ensuring clarity and impact.\n\nSetup:\n  • Teams open their proposal deck template on laptops.  \n  • Slide projected shows placeholders and naming conventions.  \n\nMaterials needed:\n  • Your saved image files (Ladybug graphs, model views, BOQ/ROI snapshots).  \n  • Deck template with image frames ready.  \n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm each team’s images are exported at ≥ 300 dpi.  \n  • Verify deck template frames are unlocked and sized correctly.  \n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “Now you’ll drag your high-res images into the gallery placeholders in your proposal deck.”  \n  2. “Follow the filename convention `Team#_<Content>.<ext>` so we can track and share easily.”  \n  3. “Make sure each image fills its frame without distortion—right-click → ‘Fit to Frame’ if needed.”  \n\nKey Points:\n  1. Consistency: Uniform naming helps us collate all teams’ assets later.  \n  2. Quality: 300 dpi ensures sharp visuals both on screen and in print.  \n  3. Placement: Use the deck’s built-in frames to maintain layout alignment.  \n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Locate your “kWh Savings” graph and drag into first placeholder (2 min).  \n  2. Insert your Sun-Wall model screenshot into second frame (2 min).  \n  3. Add your BOQ and ROI snapshots into the gallery (4 min).  \n  4. Save your deck as `Team#_FinalDeck.pptx` and upload to Telegram (2 min).  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Image too large/low res: Re-export from source at 300 dpi.  \n  • Frame locked: Right-click frame → Format → Unlock or ask me to unlock.  \n\nTransition:\n  “Great—your deck is now visually ready.

      "content": "The user is asking me to diagnose why this 5-day architecture workshop on green and heritage design for Mosul feels messy and disorganized, and then provide insights on how to make it more clear, focused, energetic, and enthusiastic.\n\nLet me analyze the current structure:\n\n**Current Workshop Overview:**\n- 5 days total\n- Each day follows a 3-block rhythm: Learn → Apply → Sell\n- Day 1: Understanding Energy\n- Day 2: Materials & Trust (Beauty & Benefit)\n- Day 3: Roofs & Realistic Wins (Truth & Trust)\n- Day 4: Walls, Windows & Wellness (Proof & Persuasion)\n- Day 5: Innovation & Enterprise (Leadership & Change)\n\n**Key Issues I'm noticing:**\n\n1. **Overwhelming Content Volume**: Each day is packed with numerous activities, ice-breakers, technical lessons, hands-on work, and pitching practice. There's too much switching between different types of activities.\n\n2. **Unclear Progression**: While the days have themes, the connection between them isn't clear.

Using Beit Turath Al Mosul as base with heritage house visits\n8. Mix of civil/architectural graduates\n9. Group work with rotating roles\n10. More focus on project management skills\n\nThe key is to keep the Learn/Apply/Sell structure but make it more practical, locally grounded, and architecturally focused.Based on the feedback, here's how to update the workshop while keeping the Learn/Apply/Sell structure but making it more architectural, practical, and locally grounded:\n\n## Updated 5-Day Structure\n\n### **Day 1: Problems & Principles**\n**LEARN (9:30-11:00)**\n- Welcome at Beit Turath Al Mosul heritage house\n- Walk through heritage cooling features in the building itself\n- 49°C reality check with IR readings on-site\n- Form teams of 4 with rotating roles (Designer, Calculator, Documenter, Presenter)\n\n**APPLY (11:00-1:30)**\n- Heritage house tours (Fatima's river houses + old city)\n- Sketch and measure actual courtyards, mashrabiya, thermal mass walls\n- Create \"Pattern Language\" cards from what you observe\n- Calculate actual ΔT in working heritage examples\n\n**SELL (1:30-2:30)**\n- Meet a real client family from the neighborhood\n- Practice empathy mapping with actual residents\n- Learn their pain points about heat/cost/comfort\n\n**Homework**: Visit 3 material suppliers, collect datasheets, prices, photos. Start populating BOQ template with real local units (m³ for alabaster, etc.)\n\n### **Day 2: Materials & Methods**\n**LEARN**\n- Local materials showcase (bring samples to class)\n- How materials are sold locally (length/weight/volume)\n- Thermal mass vs insulation in Mosul context\n- Daily labor rates (kulfat al yawmiya)\n\n**APPLY**\n- Build physical mock-ups using local materials\n- Supplier speed-dating calls (real negotiations)\n- Site visit to block/brick factory (ma3amil)\n- Calculate ROI for 250m² partial façade upgrade\n\n**SELL**\n- Practice \"retrofit pitching\" (i3adat tarmeem)\n- Role-play with contractors (muqawilleen)\n- Cost-conscious framing for different budgets\n\n**Homework**: Complete detailed BOQ with verified prices, share supplier photos on social media\n\n### **Day 3: Digital Tools + Creativity**\n**LEARN**\n- Simple Rhino-Ladybug demo using Beit Turath model\n- Target -30% cooling load through design\n- Glazing ratios and orientation strategies\n\n**APPLY**\n- Run simulations on YOUR Day 1 sketches\n- Create before/after heat maps\n- Convert kWh savings to IQD/year\n- Mind-map design alternatives\n\n**SELL**\n- Create Instagram/TikTok content from your visuals\n- 60-second explanation videos\n- \"Design storytelling\" practice\n\n**Homework**: Export visuals for ROI presentation\n\n### **Day 4: Costing & Professional Practice**\n**LEARN**\n- Comparative BOQ (Good/Better/Best options)\n- m² vs m³ pricing (alabaster example)\n- Project management basics (Ustath Wifaq guest lecture)\n- Generator costs vs passive savings over 10 years\n\n**APPLY**\n- Build full comparative BOQ for 250m² house\n- Meet architecture firm representatives (maktab al 3umran)\n- Review real customer requirements documents\n- Negotiation role-play with qana3a principles\n\n**SELL**\n- Professional proposal formatting\n- Objection-response practice\n- Value proposition development\n\n**Homework**: Finalize ROI calculator, record pitch video\n\n### **Day 5: Design Sprint & Real Projects**\n**LEARN**\n- Presentation craft\n- Network building strategies\n- Setting up support systems\n\n**APPLY (5-hour sprint)**\n- Real client brief from architecture firms\n- Complete design for 250m² sustainable house\n- Full BOQ + ROI + presentation materials\n- Prototype key details/models\n\n**SELL**\n- Present to jury of employers + clients\n- Public commitment ceremony\n- Launch alumni WhatsApp group\n\n**Homework**: 30-day action plan with first client meeting scheduled\n\n## Key Improvements:\n\n1. **Heritage-First**: Start every day at Beit Turath, use the building as teaching tool\n\n2. **Real Scales**: 250-300m² houses (not 150m²) matching local market\n\n3. **Actual Clients**: Partner with maktab al 3umran for real project briefs\n\n4. **Local Knowledge**: \n   - Alabaster by m³\n   - Daily labor rates\n   - Local supplier ecosystem\n   - Block factory visits\n\n5. **Professional Skills**: Project management, BOQ accuracy, client relations\n\n6. **Group Dynamics**: Teams of 4 with rotating roles build collaboration\n\n7. **Tangible Outputs**: Each day produces something portfolio-worthy\n\n8. **Cultural Integration**: River houses, old city, working with Baladiyyah\n\nThis keeps your structure but grounds it deeply in Mosul's context, making it more architectural, practical, and exciting for participants.",
