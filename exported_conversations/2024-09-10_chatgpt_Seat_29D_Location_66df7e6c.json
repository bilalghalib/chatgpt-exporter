      "content": "For the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (B789), seat 29D is typically located in the economy class section and is an **aisle seat**. \n\nMost configurations of the 787-9 Dreamliner have a 3-3-3 layout in economy, meaning each row has three seats on each side of the aisle. In this case:\n\n- **29A** is the window seat,\n- **29B** is the middle seat,\n- **29C** is the aisle seat on the left side, and\n- **29D** is the aisle seat on the right side of the central block of seats (next to 29E and 29F, which are the middle seats). \n\nSo, **29D** is **not a middle seat** but rather an aisle seat.",
