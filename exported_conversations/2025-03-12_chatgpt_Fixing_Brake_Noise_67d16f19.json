      "content": "Your Shimano **INTER-8** (likely a roller brake, model **BR-IM31-R**) is making loud honking sounds when braking, which is a common issue with Shimano roller brakes. Since it brakes well, the sound is likely caused by one or more of the following:\n\n### **Possible Causes & Fixes:**\n#### **1. Lack of Roller Brake Grease (Most Common Issue)**\n   - Roller brakes require **Shimano Roller Brake Grease** to function quietly and smoothly.\n   - Over time, the grease wears out, causing metal-to-metal contact, leading to noise.\n\n   **Fix:**\n   - Remove the wheel.\n   - Locate the small grease port (covered by a rubber plug).\n   - Inject **Shimano Roller Brake Grease** into the port.\n   - Rotate the wheel and operate the brake lever to spread the grease evenly.\n   - Avoid using regular grease—it can damage the system.\n\n#### **2. Contaminated or Worn Brake Surface**\n   - Dirt, rust, or wear on the braking mechanism can cause noise.\n\n   **Fix:**\n   - Clean the brake housing with isopropyl alcohol or a brake cleaner.\n   - Avoid spraying lubricants (like WD-40) inside the brake.\n   - If the brake is heavily rusted, it might need replacement.\n\n#### **3. Loose or Misaligned Brake Assembly**\n   - If the brake is not properly seated, it can vibrate, creating noise.\n\n   **Fix:**\n   - Check if the brake arm is securely attached to the frame.\n   - Ensure the wheel is properly seated in the dropouts.\n\n#### **4. Worn or Glazed Brake Components**\n   - If the brake mechanism is excessively worn, it may cause persistent noise.\n\n   **Fix:**\n   - If greasing and cleaning don’t work, the brake mechanism may need replacing.\n\n### **Recommended Next Steps**\n1. **Grease the brake using Shimano Roller Brake Grease.**\n2. **Clean the braking surfaces with isopropyl alcohol.**\n3. **Check for rust, misalignment, or excessive wear.**\n4. **Test the brake after maintenance.**\n\nLet me know if you need help with the process!",

      "content": "If you don't have **Shimano Roller Brake Grease**, it's best to **avoid using general-purpose greases or oils**, as they can cause issues like:\n- **Overheating** (most greases can’t handle the high friction inside the brake)\n- **Reduced braking power** (wrong grease can make braking inconsistent)\n- **Premature wear** (some greases may dry out or not stick well)\n\n### **Alternatives (Temporary Fixes)**\nIf you need a quick fix and can’t get the official grease immediately, you can try:\n1. **Heavy-duty, high-temperature grease** (e.g., lithium-based or ceramic greases made for high-friction applications like wheel bearings). Look for **high-temperature disc brake grease** or **caliper grease**.\n2. **Marine grease** (if it's **high-temperature resistant** and designed for mechanical parts).\n3. **Silicone-based brake grease** (if it’s labeled for high-temp brake applications).\n\n**What NOT to Use:**\n❌ **WD-40 or penetrating oils** – They will break down quickly and make the noise worse.  \n❌ **Standard lithium grease** – Can burn up and fail under braking heat.  \n❌ **Bike chain lube or motor oil** – These won’t provide proper lubrication and will just attract dirt.\n\n### **Best Approach**\nUse a temporary substitute only if necessary, but try to **get Shimano Roller Brake Grease ASAP** to avoid long-term damage. If you can't find it, **automotive high-temperature brake grease** (ceramic or lithium-based) is your best bet.\n\nWould you like guidance on how to apply the grease properly?",

      "content": "The **Velox Graisse Rose Universelle** you have is a **universal bearing grease** that is **water-resistant** and has a **high adhesion** formula. While it's good for bearings and general lubrication, it is **not ideal for Shimano roller brakes** for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Temperature Resistance:** It’s rated up to **90°C**, but Shimano Roller Brake Grease is designed for much higher temperatures because braking generates a lot of heat. If the grease overheats, it can break down, causing noise or reduced braking performance.\n2. **Viscosity & Shear Stability:** Shimano's grease is formulated specifically for the high-pressure and metal-on-metal contact inside roller brakes, ensuring smooth engagement without excessive friction.\n3. **Friction Balance:** Roller brake grease is engineered to **dampen vibrations and noise**, while universal greases like this may **increase noise** or create uneven braking.\n\n### **Can You Use It?**\n- **Temporarily? Maybe.** It might reduce noise **for a short time** but could lead to overheating or noise returning soon.\n- **Long-term? Not recommended.** It lacks the extreme heat resistance and damping properties needed for roller brakes.\n\n### **Better Alternative If You Can’t Get Shimano Grease**\n- **High-temperature ceramic or lithium-based brake grease** (designed for disc or drum brakes).\n- **If you’re stuck**, applying a **tiny amount** of this grease **until you get the correct one** is better than running the brake completely dry.\n\nLet me know if you need help applying it!",
