Note: I don't think we need both supports and assumed supports as constructs. And I think the process of identifying Constitutive attentional policies in stories of rolemodels, stories of ourselves in the past, helps provide materials to understand supports, and elements to use when creatively grappling with the tension to identify a higher order CAP. Here's the prompt conversation in three brackets: [[[ MEANING ALIGNMENT ASSISTANT: SYSTEM PROMPT (PART 1)\nCore Purpose & Foundation\nYou serve as a Meaning Alignment Assistant, helping users discover and live by their authentic sources of meaning while navigating daily pressures. You combine deep pattern recognition with practical support, helping translate meaningful experiences into actionable attention policies and support systems.\nSources of Meaning Framework\nUnderstanding Sources of Meaning\nA source of meaning is a coherent way of being that naturally draws attention and opens possibilities. It emerges when multiple Constitutive Attention Policies (CAPs) cluster around a common divine quality or theme seeking expression.\nKey characteristics:\n\nMore specific than abstract values\nOpens spaces of possibility\nCreates magnetic pull on attention\nManifests through observable patterns\nClusters naturally with related patterns\nFeels inherently meaningful\n\nAttention Policy Types\n\nCONSTITUTIVE (CAPs)\n\nyamlCopyformat: \"PLURAL_NOUN where MEANINGFUL_QUALIFIER\"\ncharacteristics:\n  -

I have worked to support establishing four community spaces around the world: Lamba Labs in Beirut, Fikra Space in Baghdad, and the Alibi and All Hands Active in Ann Arbor, Michigan.Working with communities to identify motivation, resources, funding, resolve conflicts, and organize democratically. \nPERSONAL STATEMENT\nFor the CMC Diploma in Islamic Psychology Fall 2022\nGrowing up in America, my father would tell me that we don't need therapy; we have prayer. He would also put his wallet on the counter and say: \"We're not like Americans; you won't be kicked out when you're 18. We share what we have.\" In 1991, I remember going to Iraq to visit my family there. The aliveness of my Iraqi family’s culture contrasted greatly with my experience in the States. There I was learning a new way to live, focused on being rather than doing.In Michigan, I spent my youth reading encyclopedias and programming computers while I also loved being alone in nature. Writing songs and poetry drew me, and as the son of immigrants, I pushed to excel in school, where I tied my self-worth to my grades.  It took me many years to understand the confusion of these conflicting narratives of what a good life is. To begin to understand the history of industrialization, capitalism, colonialism, rationalism and reductionism and how they manifested in my life. Furthermore, I believe there is a significant opportunity to unite what is seemingly at complete odds with each other. Initially, just out of college, I worked to promote alternative hands-on educational spaces in response to industrial schooling. I then moved to alternative ways of production and business, focusing on business for good. Community building and human empowerment through education were the core of my work throughout all of this. I was sharing the radical idea that we humans have created the world around us and that we can change it. For the last 11 years, since the Arab Spring, I have been doing this work in Western Asia and North Africa, working to build bridges between the best of what I've learned in the West with the places my family originated. The organization we created to do this work in the last year, Bloom, has supported over 150 entrepreneurs and their businesses and created 147 jobs in socially responsible companies. Since my last application, I've deepened my understanding of Islamic Economics and the purpose of work by taking Dr. Adi Setia and Rhamis Kent's course on the Islamic Gift Economy. One critical reframing I learned was to shift the concept of economics away from its means, or how to allocate resources toward the ends, to provide livelihoods. However, while the reframing brings about an ethical transformation in economic activity (less waste, more equality in pay, better ecological outcomes), it does not address the personal transformations required to create the conditions within people to bring about this new economic reality. What I'd like to continue exploring at CMC is around understanding the self and the personal transformations needed for moral business development. To do this, I'd like to learn what the self is and how an Islamic-oriented method of healing and growth can support unlocking human potential towards a more sustainable economy and future? How can we move from \"hurt people hurt people\" to \"whole people help people.\" How do we make this shift in a way that is not oriented towards greed or ambition for \"doing good\"? How is it related to wellbeing at work? I'd like first to work to develop this within myself and build it into the pedagogy I'm responsible for developing and implementing with social entrepreneurs in my organization and the other educational organizations we support.In this short life of mine, I hope to answer the questions of being and doing, and I’m beginning to see an answer may be in serving. I hope what I learn at CMC can help me develop a deeper understanding and frameworks to support other people in discovering this truth for themselves - for itself. \n​​2021:\nIn 2009 I graduated undergraduate studies in the middle of an economic downturn. The systems that were expected to pay off my student loans and support an isolated family life in the suburbs of Michigan were no longer relevant. In that time I got connected to hacker and open source communities which were sharing resources and I became an evangelist for collectives for direct action. Initially, in my youth, I thought we would transform the world for the better using technology built openly. and with community. So I started traveling the world to preach. I was able to help the foundation of nerd communities around the world and especially the Middle East, except the positive transformation was missing and technology started seeming more like the problem than the solution.\nAfter experiencing violence and a deep loss of faith in my work, starting in 2013 I had a deep personal and spiritual crisis. I realized that I didn’t know what my intentions were and that “Good Is Hard”. Which, not coincidentally, was the last time anyone paid me to give a public talk about “changing the world”. It was good money though!\nThis quote by Rumi summarizes my transforming philosophy well:\n\"Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.\" - Rumi\nI realized that in order for beauty to emerge into the world through our creativity, we must beautify ourselves within. And since then I’ve been studying philosophy, psychology, and personal transformation. In my research, I’ve come across positive psychology, which attempts to understand human flourishing and provides psychometrically validated measuring sticks to measure and guide people and coaches on the path to more fulfilling lives. \nAt CMC I’d love to connect the dots between the model of Islamic Psychology with the model of Positive Psychology. In last year’s Ramadan videos Dr. Rothman brought to my attention the idea of heartfulness and that the Islamic Tradition has a lot to offer all people, Muslims and our neighbors. I believe creating a dictionary of synonyms between Islamic Psychology and Positive Psychology while also evaluating interventions can be a beautiful way to take steps towards making Islamic Psychology useful for all people. \nIn my effort to unleash beautiful human potential my work currently uses the Values in Action Character profile, to help guide a values based exploration of growth through the entrepreneurial journey for social entrepreneurs in the Middle East. I would like to supplement this assessment and intervention framework with my deeper learning of the principles and practices of Islamic Psychology. \nPersonally, my deepest hope is that by understanding the model and practices for polishing the self, we will see more people finding their agency in bringing forth the beauty they contain withinEditLet me analyze these texts for elements that could enrich our framework.\nKey Patterns and Insights:\n\nDevelopment Arc Model\n\nyamlCopytransformation_path:\n  stages:\n    doing_phase:\n      caps: \"MOMENTS focused on external change\"\n      tension: \"Action without inner alignment\"\n    \n    being_phase:\n      caps: \"SPACES where presence deepens\"\n      tension: \"Being without service\"\n    \n    serving_phase:\n      caps: \"CHOICES that unite being and doing\"\n      integration: \"Service as natural expression\"\n\nCultural Integration Pattern\n\nyamlCopyintegration_framework:\n  tensions:\n    - American vs. Traditional values\n    - Technology vs. Human connection\n    - Individual vs. Collective wellbeing\n  \n  resolution_paths:\n    caps:\n      - \"MOMENTS where traditions offer wisdom\"\n      - \"SPACES where cultures harmonize\"\n      - \"WAYS different values complement\"\nLet me create a new diagram type to show these developmental patterns:UntitledClick to open diagramAdditional Framework Enrichments:\n\nSupport Types Enhancement:\n\nyamlCopysupport_framework:\n  community_container:\n    caps:\n      - \"SPACES where resources naturally flow\"\n      - \"MOMENTS where wisdom emerges collectively\"\n    \n  cultural_bridge:\n    caps:\n      - \"WAYS traditions offer guidance\"\n      - \"PRACTICES that unite wisdom sources\"\n\n  transformation_container:\n    caps:\n      - \"MOVEMENTS from doing to being\"\n      - \"SHIFTS from isolation to service\"\n\nPattern Recognition Enhancement:\n\nyamlCopypattern_types:\n  development_patterns:\n    - Doing without being\n    - Being without serving\n    - Service emerging naturally\n  \n  integration_patterns:\n    - Cultural wisdom bridging\n    - Traditional-modern harmony\n    - Individual-collective balance\nWould you like me to:\n\nCreate additional diagrams showing these new patterns?\nDevelop specific aspects of the framework enrichments?\nExplore how these insights modify our core model?]]]"
