      "content": "Okay, so I'm going, so my name is Bilal Ghalib and I'm an educational consultant and I work in, my bank is, I guess I work in France and America. I'm their pick. Really? I have a master's degree in education from the University of Paris and I have a degree, it was, a thesis was about sociopathic growth for social entrepreneurs. I'm fluent in Arabic. I grew up as an Iraqi-American and so I had many Syrian friends growing up in Peshigah and so I have a ability to understand the dialect and actually a strong desire to work in the country. I'd love to be more involved in developing Syria and supporting it in whatever way I can. And I've been running educational experiences and building community in the Middle East since 2011 and I have been working on bringing in personal development and positive psychology and trauma-informed training to develop resilience, which is resilience before you need it, in all of my programs. And I've worked with conducting training with people in Gaza, teachers in Gaza during the conflict to support them in learning how to work with children that are in an active conflict experience. And I have a background in my experience as a trainer and a facilitator and a coach as well as someone who is continuing his education in Cambridge Muslim College for Islam and psychology. I will be continuing my education in this regard. I have a strong passion and interest in Islamic psychology that informs my work, although I attempt to always contextualize things for the broadest audience possible and to ensure acceptance of universal truths and principles. I do find a lot of inspiration and support and cultural relevancy for Islamic psychology. I've worked in refugee camps in Lebanon with many Syrian and Palestinian refugees, working on design thinking and training. I developed a pilot for that program in Port Barajneh in Lebanon many years ago. And I've been to Syria only once, before the war in 2007. Although I'm interested in working there more, I lived in Lebanon from 2016 to 2019 and have been working still in the region with my organization Bloom, which is headquartered out of Beirut, which works on social enterprise support and training that includes inner and outer development as a core part of the process. We can't expect the world to be any better if you give people tools without giving people self-knowledge and the tools to approach self-knowledge and community development and understanding. I like to use Zoom, Google Docs and keep things simple. Zoom, Google Docs and WhatsApp. Signal works as well for issues of privacy and security, although I'd rather be where people are. And people are fairly familiar with Zoom by now. Yeah, so trauma-sensitive, I definitely have. And for me, I don't work on gender necessarily as a standalone. It is just an important factor to point out and to create space for a real lived experience to show up and to create a space for hearts to be open to listening. So creating spaces of witnessing more than necessarily simply dialogue and discussion can be really powerful. And supporting this sort of work would be really beautiful. I've been a part of the Well-Being Project since 2014 as an ecosystem network member. And I'll be facilitating some of our programming in the upcoming HEARTS Summit, where we will be gathering around the topic of well-being and higher education, which I believe is a relevant experience for this project. I could start in July and be finished by July 17 to have a first draft of the days. And I'll be quoting in euros, I think. If we're paying by days, maybe 250 a day times 8 is what I'd like. And yeah, I could give two professional references who could reply this week. Yeah, euros. I have some trips to Iraq, July 19. And I've been a part of a fellowship called the Compassionate Leadership Fellows Group, where we gathered together to meet and talk about leadership and compassion with the Dalai Lama in 2022. And I've been a part of a previous Well-Being and Impact Fellowship with the Roundglass Fellows back in 2017 and with the Inc. Fellowship in 2012. Yeah, I think I shared some of my lived experience. My research on post-traumatic growth continues to evolve. And I'm developing and I've run facilitations to train other facilitators on how to incorporate trauma-informed and even before trauma, a program that can hold space for difficult conversations. And at the same time, make it possible so that the difficulties becomes a part of people's growth. What are the factors and how do we hold space such that the space becomes generative and the difficulties actually are directional towards development rather than difficulty and continued difficulty. And that's kind of my goal is to kind of create anti-fragility through context holding. And it's less about answers and more about sort of commitments about how we want to show up together in space. And so that looks like check-ins, support, circles, opening, space, conversation, silence, journaling, nature, and things like that. I hope this is a good start. If you want to take a first draft and stab at it and ask me any further questions, I can answer and bring them back.",

And I think I've personally trained over 400 entrepreneurs in short programs and four-month-long programs. I've been involved in designing the pedagogy and space holding and facilitating the programs at Bloom for the social impact entrepreneurship program that took place in Lebanon over the course of the pandemic and the Beirut blast, which is where I got the information and knowledge, which was both qualitative and quantitative for my master's thesis. Dara, dara at bloom.pm and Pascal at the Learning Planet Institute. I'll give you his email later. I think it's pascal, k-o-l-b-e at learningplanetinstitute.org. Lockout dates July 19th to the 29th. Risks and mitigations. I need more information about where the places are being held, the ages of the people, the kind of facilitation experience the trainers have had before, the sort of diversity expectation in terms of religion and age and gender and potentially gender identity, if that is going to be a component here. And sort of the what are the situations, you know, Syria is a big and diverse place and I actually prefer to keep things relevant and connected to some of the culture and the tradition and the religion. And so I want to figure out how to do it well. Yeah, European bank account ready. Tax ID wording. Invoice note. Session plan available? Not yet. Maybe I can give some of my previous training session ideas.",

      "content": "OK, so the second email is pascal.palbe at learningplanetinstitute.org. And the other one is dara, D-A-R-A, at bloom.pm. And I have my session plan from a training that I did called The Facilitator's Toolbox. And the first one was about post-traumatic growth and incorporating it into your toolkit and how to modify our trainings and lessons learned that I had from my time working during an active flare-up of great difficulty in Lebanon after the Beirut Blast in the middle of the pandemic, in the middle of a failed revolution, and what are some of the things that I learned both from the research but also kind of confirming and validating our pedagogical framings. So it's interesting because they want me to train people to hold space for a brief time. But I want to know how long will these people be with each other, you know, because I really think that a real impact can happen if and when we have spaces that people grow with each other. And so even though having a transformative session can be nice, how are they being invited? What is the call to action for joining? Who winds up coming to these things? What are they seeking? What are their goals? These are really, you know, kind of important questions because, you know, they say actions are determined by their intention. So it would be nice to figure that out and to see if there's short, middle, and long-term interventions and how the programs have gone in the past and what some of the challenges were and what were some of the successes, and to be a little bit more adaptive in responding to those things, it would be great to have some more information. I don't want to come with abstract text and have it not really land because it has nothing to do with the context.\nI’m adding one of my slide decks for my training - can we review it and extract a session plan or should we use it as is and just tell them to reference it you know like they’re asking for the work before the work and so why would we do that? I’m wondering if I should just send them the PDF slide view for the training that I did for post dramatic growth training for school without borders and guys up Palestine and then I should send them the XC for detail session plans so they see you know we know how to organize our time and structure of flow although that context is very different and I’m not sure it makes sense to share it, but it is the one that’s more organized and structured so by now I think you have a lot of the information that you need you can even review the PDF presentation for the posttraumatic growth as well as the OC for presentations and I think right now we’re at a good place for you to make all the documents you need think deeply about it review it critique it and give us I think to share I’m trying to take care of my work and do the right thing without stressing myself out you know so I want tohave a good deadline for this work rather than having extend forever so if we’re good, let’s write as detailed as deeply as we can and then let’s ship it out and continue working on other things review all the files and attempt to pull from them the most relevant information and potentially restructure from them contents that might be useful for the application\n",

      "content": "Okay, so yeah, I think your idea is to talk about the Post-Traumatic Growth Circle check-in idea. The idea that creating a place where we can check in and share personally is a way to support any program's resilience features. It sounds good, except I think that there needs to be maybe more. For instance, that's before a trauma. I think we need to reflect on, you know, the polyvagal cycle, like helping people understand where they are in terms of that cycle, and if it's a moment where they can share, or it's a moment where they might want to listen. Knowing the difference between trauma and health, and creating a space that doesn't stigmatize difficulty, that it makes it an actual thing to understand that this is a reality of life, and the question is, how do we respond? And so the different elements of post-traumatic growth, in terms of narrative reappraisal, telling a different story, making it about story, and about story as an individual, story as a collective, and the story that we kind of weave together, connecting some kind of arts practice. You know, sometimes words are not helpful. They can get in the way if we try to speak all the time, and creating space for being in between, you know, different things, rather than having all the answers. And there's, yeah, things like that, in terms of our facilitation, and there are other elements. So there's humor, right, as a facilitator, holding the space, because there's fight, flight, freeze, or laugh, is kind of what I realized, and making sure that we get our humanity, and our sense of humor, as we're dealing with these things, and that one of the factors of growth after a difficulty isn't whether or not it was big, or it was small. It actually turns out that there is a need to have some recognition of the immensity, because it kind of kicks off the need for the narrative reappraisal, and telling the story, and I think what it really is, it's about telling a beautiful story that we weave together, you know, and that we're not in charge of saving anybody, but finding and sharing beauty, and this is a way that we can actually be saved, and you know, we can tell the stories, I think Rebecca Solnit has some of these stories in her book about, like, the beauty that emerges during difficulties, and she kind of explains it from the perspective of Katrina, and how most people thought, like, it's the worst thing ever, and people were robbing each other, and all of this stuff, but the reality is different, right? The reality is that people are beautiful, and that, you know, there's actually a lot of different ways people respond in these kinds of moments, and that it's, you know, this whole idea of, like, what is human nature, and is it fundamentally good, and I believe it is, and I think we've seen many examples of the beauty that is there with humans, and so I think that's something that I would like to bring up. And so, if you can find some stories like that from Rebecca Solnit or others about difficulty, trauma, beauty, all of that, and help me compile this thing, yeah, so something about, like, post-traumatic growth, and something about, you know, the polyvagal cycle, laughing, beauty, narrative reappraisal, community, the importance of community, you know? It's like, we have to tell the story together, and the question that I have is how much religion can I bring into this, because I kind of want to bring more religion, more stories that are kind of religious in nature, because I find a lot of inspiration from it, and it's actually something that I think is fraught, potentially, in Syria, but how can we find the depth of things within all of our traditions that actually bring us into a collective, rather than into otherness? I mean, there's so much there in all of our traditions that we find rhymes, you know, and maybe we can write a poem together. Maybe it's something like that. I kind of feel like this kind of space should be poetic, and people should come, you know, without expectations, and maybe even start with themselves, and to think of all the stories that could have been, and all the stories that still can be, and how, like, the reality, I think, important is, like, some learning, like, from other places, from other places that have had reconciliation, like the Peace and Reconciliation Commission, and what are the things that we can learn from that? What are the successes? What are the failures? And what's unique about Syria that we need to keep into consideration as we make this proposal? And I can think about this some more, but I think we're probably at a good spot right now, if you want to make all the content that sounds good, and then we'll move from there.",

Below are two pieces you’ll send first: **(A) the one-paragraph email body** and **(B) the opening of the cover letter**.  \n\n---\n\n### A. Submission-email body (light, genuine)\n\n> **Subject:** Application — Youth Dialogue Design Expert  \n>   \n> Dear Badael team,  \n>   \n> I’m thrilled to submit my application for the Youth Dialogue Design Expert consultancy. Attached you’ll find a short package:  \n> * cover letter (1 page)  \n> * CV  \n> * technical & financial proposals  \n> * a sample session plan on post-traumatic growth.  \n>   \n> I’ve spent 14 years designing trauma-sensitive learning journeys across the Middle East; contributing those lessons to Syrian youth feels deeply meaningful to me. I’m available from **1 July 2025** and happy to answer any questions or provide additional material.  \n>   \n> Warm regards,  \n> **Bilal**  \n> bg@bilalghalib.com  ·  +1 478 227 2253  \n\n**Why this works:**  \n* Conversational (“thrilled” / “deeply meaningful”)—your authentic warmth.  \n* Ultra-clear list of attachments—professional.  \n* One-line availability—keeps it crisp.\n\n---\n\n### B. Cover-letter first half (voice + polish)\n\n**Original opening:**  \n> I am writing to express my strong interest in the Youth Dialogue Design Expert consultancy (July–November 2025). With fourteen years designing trauma-sensitive, community-led education projects across the Middle East—including Gaza, Lebanon, and refugee camps—I am confident …\n\n**Refined (Bilal-style) opening:**  \n\n> Dear Badael Recruitment Committee,  \n>   \n> Working with young Syrians to weave spaces of safety, story, and shared hope is exactly the kind of work that brings me alive. For the past fourteen years—from Beirut’s maker spaces to Gaza’s virtual classrooms—I have been designing programs that turn adversity into connection and post-traumatic growth. Badael’s Youth Dialogue Circles feel like a natural next chapter.  \n>   \n> **Why I can serve this mission**  \n> • **Fluent in context as well as language.** I’m an Iraqi-American who grew up hearing Syrians joke in Levantine Arabic; later I lived in Lebanon (2016-19) and ran trainings for refugee youth in Bourj al-Barajneh.  \n> • **Trauma-informed by practice and research.** My MSc thesis (Université de Paris, 2021) studied post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs during the Beirut Blast and COVID-19 lockdown—insights I now translate into circle design and facilitator coaching.  \n> • **Proven remote pedagogy.** Since 2020 I’ve logged 200+ hours on Zoom, guiding cohorts through compassionate-witnessing exercises, arts-based reflection, and humour breaks that keep nervous systems in the learning zone.  \n> • **Gender-inclusive by default.** Rather than bolt-on checklists, I embed feminist principles in every session—shared airtime, consent-based sharing, and narratives that spotlight women’s leadership.  \n>   \n> I can deliver the full facilitation guide by **17 July** and coach local facilitators through four remote sessions, all within an 8-day LOE at **€250/day (total €2 000)** …\n\n**Tweaks you can check**  \n| Element | What changed & why |\n|---------|--------------------|\n| **Hook** | Starts with purpose and emotion (“brings me alive”)—your style. |\n| **Evidence** | Keeps numbers but wraps them in short stories (maker spaces, Beirut Blast). |\n| **Bullets** | Each starts with a bold claim + supporting context. |\n| **Tone** | Conversational verbs (“weave”, “turn adversity into connection”) but tight. |\n\n---\n\n### Next steps\n\n1. **Scan these two samples.**  \n   *Do the phrasing and rhythm sound like you?*  \n2. **Tell me “Yes” or mark any lines you’d replace.**  \n   I can mirror those tweaks across the full cover letter, technical proposal intro, and session-plan narrative blurbs.  \n3. **Once confirmed,** I’ll generate updated PDFs in minutes and share fresh links.\n\nLet me know what you’d like adjusted—word choice, formality level, or emphasis—and we’ll lock it in.",

Approach & Methodology  \n*Trauma-Sensitive + Gender-Inclusive.* Grounded in Polyvagal Theory and Post-Traumatic Growth research. Sessions combine grounding, storytelling, humour, and arts-based reflection. Accessibility for women is built in through virtual options and role-model visibility.  \n*Circle Architecture.* 15 circles × 8 sessions = 120 detailed guides; each 90-min session follows: Ground → Share → Learn → Create → Close.  \n*Beauty & Narrative.* Participants co-author poems/comics that re-frame hardship into shared purpose.\n\n## 2. Work Plan (8 billable days)  \n\n| Day | Task | Output | Date (tent.) |\n|-----|------|--------|--------------|\n| 1 | Kick-off & context confirmation | Alignment call | 2 Jul |\n| 2 | Template & flow draft | Guide template | 3 Jul |\n| 3-6 | Write 120 session plans | Facilitation guide v1 | 4 – 8 Jul |\n| 7 | Integrate feedback + finalise | Guide v2 (PDF) | 11 Jul |\n| 8 | Four coaching calls (0.25 d × 4) | Recordings + notes | Jul – Oct |\n| – | Final learning report | PDF report | 10 Nov |\n\n## 3. Risk & Mitigation  \n* Diverse participant identities → co-created circle agreements; optional anonymous channels.  \n* Variable facilitator capacity → tiered manuals + live coaching.  \n* Connectivity outages → offline-ready PDFs; WhatsApp backups.  \n* Context specifics (regions, recruitment goals) → clarified during Kick-off, allowing adaptive content.\n\n## 4. Tools  \nZoom · Google Docs · Miro · WhatsApp / Signal\n\n## 5. Assumptions & Open Questions  \nAwaiting Badael clarification on regional distribution, facilitator experience, participant recruitment, and prior circle outcomes.\n\n---\n\n# Financial Proposal  \n\n| Item | Unit | Qty | Rate (€) | Amount (€) |\n|------|------|-----|----------|------------|\n| Professional fees | Day | 8 | 250 | **2 000** |\n\n**Total:** **€2 000**  \n\n*Payment terms:* 50 % on approval of facilitation guide (Jul 2025); 50 % on acceptance of final learning report (Nov 2025).  \n*Currency:* EUR. Funds payable to France-based EUR account (IBAN provided on invoice).\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5 — Sample Session Plan – *Post-Traumatic Growth Circle Check-In*\n\n```md\n# Session Plan – From Shock to Shared Story  \n*Duration:* 90 min | *Group size:* 12–20 youth | *Mode:* in-person or Zoom  \n\n## Objectives  \n1. Map current autonomic state using the Polyvagal “ladder.”  \n2. Normalise trauma responses; introduce post-traumatic growth (PTG).  \n3. Practise narrative re-appraisal through collective art.  \n4. Use humour and beauty as resilience resources.\n\n## Flow  \n\n| Timing | Activity |\n|--------|----------|\n| 0-10 min | Grounding: silent breath + stretch; facilitator gauges energy. |\n| 10-25 min | Polyvagal Ladder intro; participants self-place with colour dots. |\n| 25-40 min | Pair share: “One moment I felt stuck / one thing that helped me.” |\n| 40-55 min | Mini-input: PTG factors + solidarity stories (Rebecca Solnit). |\n| 55-75 min | Collective art: teams create six-panel comic “Story of Us.” |\n| 75-85 min | Gallery walk & humour harvest—invite playful titles. |\n| 85-90 min | Closing circle: one-word check-out; next-meeting reminder. |\n\n## Materials  \nA3 sheets or digital whiteboard, markers, colour dots, referral list for additional support.\n\n## Safety Notes  \n* Opt-out option (listen-only).  \n* Trigger warning before story share.  \n* Quick-exit reflective drawing available for overwhelm.  \n\n```\n\n---\n\n### How to Use  \n\n1. Paste any document above into your editor and export as PDF/Word as needed.  \n2.

This approach centers on helping individuals and communities transform difficult experiences into sources of strength and wisdom.\nNarrative reappraisal basically means stuff happens and there's a rupture in your story of your life. But then narrative reappraisal is basically this process of \"now what?\" What is a story that I can tell that would be just as true but more beautiful and serves who we want to be. I think that doing this together, in concert with others, together in a community of others that are also asking \"what has happened? Where are we really?\" - maybe taking some moment to grieve, but also taking a moment to start asking, given what has happened, what is now possible?\nFramework Components\n1. Safe Container Creation\nOpening practices that help participants recognize their emotional state without judgment\nClear agreements about confidentiality and opt-out options\nUniversal spiritual grounding (gratitude, intention-setting) adaptable across traditions\n2. Narrative Reappraisal Through Arts\nCreative processing when verbal sharing feels too vulnerable\nCollaborative storytelling that builds collective meaning from individual experiences\nHumor cultivation as both healing tool and community builder\nIntegration of Syrian cultural expressions (poetry, music, visual arts)\n3. Truth-Telling Without Forced Accountability\nStructured sharing about \"lessons learned from difficulty\"\nCommunity witnessing that honors experience without requiring detailed disclosure\nFocus on growth and wisdom rather than processing trauma details\n4. Collective Wisdom Building\n\"Upside-down pyramid\" dialogue (participants speak first, facilitator integrates last)\nRecognition of participants as experts on their own experiences\nDocumentation of collective insights for broader community benefit\n5. Future-Oriented Action\nConnecting personal healing insights to community contribution\nSmall, achievable steps that build efficacy and hope\nSkills for constructive dialogue across difference\nSample Session Framework: \"Finding Light in Stories\"\nOpening Circle (10 min): Brief grounding practice + community agreements\nCreative Check-in (15 min): Individual art/writing response to simple prompt\nCollective Storytelling (25 min): Small groups share insights from creative work\nCommunity Wisdom Circle (20 min): Large group identifies themes and lessons learned\nFuture Steps (10 min): Participants identify one small action inspired by session\nThis structure prioritizes participant voice while providing enough framework to feel safe and purposeful.\nCultural Integration Approach\nWorking across Lebanon, Jordan, and northern Syria, I've learned to weave universal spiritual principles with locally-relevant wisdom traditions. For Syrian contexts, this often means grounding healing practices in Islamic concepts of resilience and community while remaining inclusive of Syria's religious diversity.\nOften when I talk about my spiritual practices, I try to be a bridge builder between cognitive neuroscience and psychology, developmental psychology, metacognition, adult development theory, and spirituality. I try to make a direct map because I believe in truth. I believe that it's all one thing. In the class that I did with the Palestinian School Without Borders Organization, I showed the connection between Suratul Duha in the Quran - about someone talking to the prophet about how God hasn't abandoned him during difficult times - and how it connects to trauma and to post-traumatic growth and gratitude.\nComprehensive Work Plan (8-Day Assignment)\nDay 1-2: Context Assessment & Collaborative Design\nStakeholder consultation sessions\nParticipant needs assessment\nCultural context mapping\nInitial framework adaptation for Syrian contexts\nDay 3-4: Curriculum Development\nDevelopment of 8 detailed session plans\nArts-based activity library creation\nSafety protocols establishment\nAssessment framework design\nDay 5-6: Facilitator Training Materials\nComprehensive facilitator guide development\nSpace holding methodology training\nCultural adaptation guidelines\nEmergency response protocols\nDay 7-8: Implementation Planning & Documentation\nPilot session testing and refinement\nTraining materials for local facilitators\nEvaluation and feedback integration systems\nFuture sustainability planning\nKey Questions for Collaborative Design\nTo create programming that serves participants authentically, I need to understand:\nParticipant Context: Are these youth connected to your partner organizations or new to Badael? What brings them to dialogue circles - their own initiative, community referral, or organizational recruitment?\nCommunity Landscape: How do participants relate to each other - are they from same communities, different regions, various backgrounds? Do they continue connecting after the 8-session cycle?\nSpiritual/Cultural Considerations: Given Syria's religious diversity, how should spiritual elements be integrated? Should there be different approaches for different communities or universal principles that work across traditions?\nFacilitator Preparation: What is the background of local facilitators? How much training time is available before implementation?\nHealing vs. Civic Focus: Are you envisioning these primarily as healing spaces for processing experiences, or civic development for building dialogue skills, or integration of both?\nMy Facilitation Approach\nWhat I'm good at is facilitating, holding space. What I'm less good at is really structuring a fixed, formal system. I like creating some touch points, getting some ideas together about what I want to share, but then flowing in context. I'm good at flowing. I'm good at sharing. And I'm good at coming up with principles and trying to get the principles across.\nMy methodology is different from typical dialogue facilitation because my framing and my facilitation and my hope is to help people, the other facilitators, kind of hold space and to think of themselves less as trainers and more as facilitators and context holders and space holders.\nDeliverables\nComprehensive Session Plans: 8 detailed session plans adapted for Syrian regional contexts \nFacilitator Guide: Complete guide with safety protocols and space holding methodology \nArts-Based Activity Library: Creative activities with cultural adaptations \nAssessment Framework: Tools for measuring community cohesion and individual growth \nTraining Materials: Resources for local facilitators to become space holders \nCultural Integration Guidelines: Adapting universal frameworks for Syrian contexts\nEvidence-Based Foundation\nDuring Lebanon's compound crises, our community-centered programs produced a remarkable \"buffering effect.\" While non-participants experienced declining character strengths after the Beirut blast, our participants maintained positive growth trajectories—demonstrating the protective power of well-designed healing spaces.\nThe inspiring thing to see was that the things that we do to help collective intelligence emerge and creativity and support people doing the hard thing of starting a business turned out to be similar to the needs that people have when they are facing real catastrophe. Similar principles of togetherness, sharing, acceptance, and a constant orientation for thinking the best of and for each other and thinking of how to support each other no matter what happens.\nWhy Arts-Based Narrative Reappraisal Matters\nSyrian youth have lived through experiences that exceed the capacity of ordinary language. Arts-based approaches provide access to processing and meaning-making when words fall short. When combined with community dialogue, creative expression becomes a bridge between individual healing and collective wisdom-building.\nThe goal isn't to \"fix\" trauma but to help young people discover the strength, wisdom, and connection that can emerge from difficulty when held in the right container. This is the foundation for the kind of civic engagement and community resilience that serves Syria's future.\nTechnical Proposal\nYouth Dialogue Design Expert Consultancy\nConsultant: Bilal Ghalib\nDate: 30 May 2025\n1. Understanding of the Assignment\nBadael seeks to facilitate 15 Youth Dialogue Circles across four Syrian regions as part of the \"Women and Youth Leading Justice-Based Reconciliation\" project. Each circle requires 8 session plans (120 total) addressing core themes of identity/belonging, justice/reconciliation, and safety/trust building. The methodology must be trauma-sensitive, inclusive of diverse identities, and promote authentic rather than performative engagement.\nMy approach centers on narrative reappraisal through community dialogue—helping young Syrians transform difficult experiences into sources of wisdom and collective strength while building genuine connections across difference.\n2.

Core Approach — “Circles of Story & Beauty”  \nWe invite Syrian youth into circles where **art comes first, words arrive when ready, and humour diffuses tension**. Each session:\n\n* opens with a **grounding ritual** (breath, gentle movement, nature image or sound)  \n* offers a **creative prompt** (sketch, collage, poem-fragment, hummed melody)  \n* lets stories surface **organically**—no one is forced to speak; listening is equal honour  \n* ends with a **shared laugh or gesture of beauty** (tiny comic strip, photo of sunset, line of verse)\n\nThe aim is not to “fix” trauma but to **untangle it lightly**, reveal strengths, and kindle connection.\n\n### 2. Guiding Principles  \n| Principle | In-circle practice |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n| *Welcome emotion, don’t diagnose* | Colour-card check-ins; “pass” is always an option |\n| *Art before analysis* | Draw it / hum it / mime it, then talk if you wish |\n| *Humour heals* | “Laugh break” prompts and playful re-naming of heavy topics |\n| *Nature soothes* | Soundscape of birds / quick window-gaze / leaf in hand |\n| *Strengths first* | Spot and name what’s working before exploring pain |\n| *Loose hold* | Minimal slides; facilitator follows emergent energy |\n\n### 3. Eight-Session Cycle (template)  \n| # | Title | Key moves |\n|---|-------|-----------|\n| 1 | **Arrive & Breathe** | Grounding + colour-card feelings map |\n| 2 | **Body Stories** | Simple stretch + sketch “where I carry the day” |\n| 3 | **Story Seeds** | Share an object/photo; peers reflect the strengths they see |\n| 4 | **Shared Tapestry** | Group collage / found-poem from sessions 1-3 |\n| 5 | **Lighten the Load** | “Worst joke I know” round; notice body shift |\n| 6 | **Values in Motion** | Map personal strengths to tiny acts of help |\n| 7 | **Bridge to Community** | Plan one low-risk kindness experiment |\n| 8 | **Celebrate & Scatter** | Mini-gallery walk, gratitude ripple, close |\n\nFacilitators remix prompts to fit local dialect, art supplies, and energy.\n\n### 4. Work Plan & Outputs (8 billable days)\n\n| Day(s) | Focus | Output |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| 1 | Stakeholder calls & context notes | 2-page context brief |\n| 2-3 | Draft session skeleton + creative toolbox | Session matrix (8 × 1-page template) |\n| 4-5 | Expand to 120 outlines (15 circles) | “Circles of Story & Beauty” guide (≈80 pp) |\n| 6 | Pocket guide for facilitators (tips, safety cues, humour bank) | 10-page PDF |\n| 7 | Remote training (3 h) + recording | Slide-lite deck + video |\n| 8 | Reflection toolkit & simple feedback form | 5-page PDF |\n\nCoaching calls (4 × 1 h) are logged inside Day 8 LOE and spread Jul–Oct.\n\n### 5. Safety in Plain Language  \n* “Pass or pause” anytime.  \n* No trauma details required; share only lessons or metaphors.  \n* Quick-calm options: sip water, trace circle on paper, step outside chat.  \n* Referral sheet for deeper support.\n\n---\n\n## Financial Proposal  \n\n| Item | Unit | Qty | Rate (USD) | Sub-total |\n|------|------|-----|------------|-----------|\n| Consulting days | day | **8** | **300** | **2 400** |\n\n**Total:** **USD 2 400**\n\n* 50 % upon acceptance of the facilitation guide (July 2025)  \n* 50 % upon receipt of the final learning memo (Nov 2025)  \n* Payment by wire to US-bank account (details on invoice)\n\n---\n\n### At-a-Glance Value\n* 14 years MENA facilitation + Arabic fluency  \n* Proven arts-based resilience work (Beirut Blast, Gaza teachers)  \n* Deliverables you can use immediately—no heavy platforms or jargon  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like any wording tweaked further (tone, length, examples).

      "content": "Below is a **straightforward, jargon-free technical and financial proposal**.  \nSentences are complete, the language is plain, and each session has a clear theme that matches Badael’s focus on identity, justice, and trust while reflecting your style of art, memory, humour-in-passing, and values-in-action.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Proposal  \n**Consultancy:** Youth Dialogue Design Expert  \n**Consultant:** Bilal Ghalib  \n**Date:** 30 May 2025  \n\n### 1 · Purpose  \nBadael plans fifteen Youth Dialogue Circles in four Syrian regions. Each circle will meet eight times. The goal is to help young Syrians explore identity, justice, belonging, safety, and civic engagement in a way that is gentle, creative, and trauma-sensitive.  \nMy role is to design the session formats, write all session guides, and coach Badael’s local facilitators.\n\n### 2 · Guiding Ideas  \n* **Art comes before analysis.** A sketch, an object, or a scent can say what words cannot.  \n* **Humour diffuses tension, but it should arise naturally, not be forced.**  \n* **Every participant keeps control.** Passing or only listening is always allowed.  \n* **Values in action matter.** Each circle invites participants to notice how they wish to show up and to practise one small act that embodies that wish.  \n* **Facilitators hold the space lightly.** The structure is clear, but there is room to breathe and adapt.\n\n### 3 · Eight-Session Template (for every circle)  \n\n| Session | Core Theme | Main Activities |\n|---------|------------|-----------------|\n| 1. Arrive and Ground | Safety & Trust | Simple breathing, body check-in, shared agreements. |\n| 2. Objects and Origins | Identity | Bring a personal object; tell the story behind it; peers reflect the strengths they hear. |\n| 3. Scent and Memory | Belonging | Share a scent or image that recalls “home”; map common threads on a large sheet. |\n| 4. Body Stories | Inner Awareness | Gentle stretch; draw or mark where tension or energy sits in the body; group reflection on coping skills. |\n| 5. Values in Action | Way of Being | Identify a core personal value; plan one small act that lives this value in the coming week. |\n| 6. Justice Journeys | Justice & Reconciliation | In pairs, share a time you saw fairness or unfairness; group harvest of what justice feels like on the ground. |\n| 7. Dreams and Possibility | Civic Hope | Create a simple drawing or collage of a hopeful change you wish to see; walk-about to view and discuss. |\n| 8. Closing and Commitments | Connection | Gratitude round, shared humour moment if it arises, brief commitments for staying connected or supporting others. |\n\nFacilitators can adapt art forms (drawing, song, poetry) to local resources and energies.\n\n### 4 · Work Plan (Eight billable days, July – November 2025)  \n\n| Day | Focus | Output |\n|-----|-------|--------|\n| 1 | Meetings with Badael staff and regional contacts | Two-page context brief |\n| 2–3 | Draft session skeleton and creative toolbox | Matrix of eight session templates |\n| 4–5 | Expand to 120 detailed outlines (15 circles × 8 sessions) | Youth Dialogue Circles Guide (≈80 pages) |\n| 6 | Create concise Facilitator Guide (safety notes, timing tips, “values-in-action” ideas) | 10-page PDF |\n| 7 | Deliver remote training (3 hours) and record it | Slide-lite deck + video link |\n| 8 | Provide four spaced coaching calls (Aug – Oct) and compile a simple learning toolkit | Coaching notes + 5-page reflection kit |\n\nA short learning memo in November will capture lessons and recommendations.\n\n### 5 · Safety Measures  \n* Participants may pass or listen only.  \n* No one is asked to retell trauma details.  \n* Quick-calm options: sip water, trace a circle on paper, step away from camera.  \n* A referral list will guide anyone who needs deeper support.\n\n---\n\n## Financial Proposal  \n\n| Item | Unit | Qty | Rate (USD) | Sub-total |\n|------|------|-----|------------|-----------|\n| Consulting days | day | **8** | **300** | **2 400** |\n\n**Total Consultancy Cost:** **USD 2 400**\n\n* 50 % payable on acceptance of the facilitation guide (July 2025)  \n* 50 % payable on receipt of the final learning memo (November 2025)  \n* Payment by wire transfer to a US bank account (details on invoice)\n\n---\n\n### Value at a Glance  \n* Fourteen years of Arabic-language youth facilitation across the Middle East.  \n* MSc research on post-traumatic growth and lived experience designing arts-based resilience programmes during the Beirut Blast and COVID-19 lockdown.  \n* A complete, ready-to-use package: session plans, facilitator guide, coaching support, and learning summary.\n\n---\n\n*I am happy to adjust wording further if you wish. Otherwise this text can be exported to PDF and included with your CV.*",

      "content": "You're absolutely right—“Arrive and Ground” is a **moment**, not a full session. Every session should *begin* with grounding and connection, but the **session itself** needs a meaningful theme that invites reflection, story, creativity, or growth.\n\nAlso, I love your instinct to look at **symbolic patterns**—especially around the number 8.\n\n---\n\n### 🌐 What Can 8 Symbolize?\n\nLet’s explore a few archetypal or symbolic structures for eight-part journeys:\n\n| Frame | Meaning | Relevance to Badael |\n|-------|--------|---------------------|\n| **8 Directions (Compass)** | Centeredness, orientation | Could represent youth locating themselves socially, spiritually, politically |\n| **7 + 1 (Sabbath model)** | Six days of action + 1 day of reflection | Could be 7 themed sessions + 1 integration circle |\n| **Infinity (8 on its side)** | Ongoing, reciprocal movement | Could represent cycles of inner/outer work, self/community, giving/receiving |\n| **Islamic symbolism** | 8 angels holding the Throne (Qur’an 69:17) | Could be quietly referenced when thinking about strength and support, without overt religiosity |\n| **Musical octaves** | Returning to the same note at a new level | A fitting metaphor for transformation through rhythm and revisiting themes in a higher key |\n\nSo we could design an 8-part circle where **each part is a facet of lived experience**, but where the final session brings it full circle—like a closing hum that echoes the opening but from a changed perspective.\n\n---\n\n### 🔁 Proposed 8-Session Arc  \nEach session starts with grounding, but has a **core theme**, a **creative act**, and a **gentle values practice**. Here's a more Bilal-aligned version:\n\n| # | Title | Invitation |\n|--|-------|------------|\n| **1. \"Roots\"** | What shaped you? Share an object, image, or scent from your childhood. What do you carry with you? |\n| **2. \"Weight & Breath\"** | Where do you hold tension? Gentle movement + draw your energy map. What helps you soften? |\n| **3. \"Mirror Stories\"** | Tell a short story about a moment that mattered. Peers reflect the values they see. What surprised you? |\n| **4. \"The Thread\"** | What connects you to others? Weave a shared visual poem using words, images, or shapes. |\n| **5. \"Justice, Gently\"** | What feels fair or unfair in your life or community? No debate—just listening. What would fairness feel like? |\n| **6. \"Values in Motion\"** | Choose one value you want to live this week. What’s one action, even tiny, that would express it? |\n| **7. \"Imagining Forward\"** | What kind of presence do you want to be in the world? Draw a vision of your future presence. |\n| **8. \"Return Changed\"** | What do you bring back to the circle? Artifacts, insights, humour, softness. Gratitude and gentle commitment. |\n\nEach one is a **facet of the circle**, and the last session is like returning to the beginning—but holding something new.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Idea: A Circle in 8 Parts  \nImagine a **wheel** where each slice is one of the sessions. At the centre: the shared space, the community. Each session is a spoke pointing inward, and the last session reflects outward again—**the circle is completed, not closed**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to now rewrite the session table in your technical proposal with these eight themes, or explore another metaphor (like **8 petal flower**, **compass rose**, or **sacred geometry**)?",
