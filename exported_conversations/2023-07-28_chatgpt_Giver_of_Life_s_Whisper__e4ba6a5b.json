      "content": "(For context: There are 99 names for Allah, or God, in the Islamic tradition. Each name has a unique meaning and is used in devotional practices. The 96th name of Allah is \"Al-Muhyi,\" which translates to \"The Giver of Life\".)\n\nAs Cohen's work often incorporated religious and spiritual themes, I'll write this poem in a style inspired by him, with a focus on \"Al-Muhyi,\" The Giver of Life. \n\nIn the shimmer of a dimming twilight hour,\nBreathes a whisper, neither weak nor dour.\nIt calls to the silent and barren land,\nThe 96th name, spoken by the divine hand.\n\nAl-Muhyi, The Giver of Life, speaks clear,\nInto the hollows of those who bend to hear,\nFrom the lonely depths, where echoes reside,\nBrings forth life, in a tender tide.\n\nBeneath the heaviness of the tired sun,\nA prayer rises from the lips of the forlorn one.\nFingers trace the edge of the nameless void,\nIn the name of Al-Muhyi, life's mysteries deployed.\n\nHe is the marrow, the pulse within the vein,\nThe soft melody of the morning rain.\nFrom the petals’ bloom to the falcon's flight,\nHe is in every breath of the day and night.\n\nUpon the canvas of the empty, waiting earth,\nHe is the master, giving each life its birth.\nBy His command, from death springs life anew,\nIn every heartbeat, His presence we construe.\n\nIn the quiet, where the tired world lies,\nA spark within the cosmic womb silently complies,\nAl-Muhyi, with an artist’s loving grace,\nBrushes life onto the universe’s face.\n\nIn the whispering winds, His presence we infer,\nIn the rustling leaves, His voice we concur,\nIn the language of life, we find our worth,\nAl-Muhyi, The Giver of Life, brings forth.\n\nFor He is not a distant, celestial king,\nBut the intimate rhythm in the living being.\nIn the cycle of life and death, in joy and strife,\nResides the 96th name, The Giver of Life.",

      "content": "The Quran contains various verses referring to the miracle of childbirth, highlighting the intricacies of human development, and emphasizing the role of God in the process. Here are some of the relevant Ayahs (verses):\n\n1. Surah Al-Mu'minun (23:12-14):\n\n\"And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay. Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging. Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators.\"\n\nThis verse refers to the stages of human embryonic development. It emphasizes the miraculous transformation from a tiny cell to a fully developed human being.\n\n2. Surah Ghafir (40:67):\n\n\"He it is Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a leech-like clot; then does he get you out as a child; then lets you (grow and) reach your age of full strength; then lets you become old,- though of you there are some who die before;- and lets you reach a Term appointed; in order that ye may learn wisdom.\"\n\nThis Ayah mirrors the human life cycle, from creation to aging and death, highlighting the wonder and divine wisdom inherent in the process.\n\n3. Surah An-Nahl (16:78):\n\n\"And Allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers knowing nothing, and gave you hearing and sight and hearts that haply ye might give thanks.\"\n\nThis verse emphasizes the gifts of sight, hearing, and emotional intelligence given to humans, framing them as blessings for which to be grateful.\n\n4. Surah Luqman (31:14):\n\n\"And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination.\"\n\nThis verse recognizes the struggle and sacrifice of mothers during pregnancy and child-rearing, urging gratitude and respect.\n\nThese Ayahs present childbirth as a complex, miraculous event orchestrated by God, demonstrating His power and mercy. They offer a sense of wonder about the process of human development and express gratitude for the gift of life.",

      "content": "In the Quran, pregnancy is often depicted as a period of wonder and divine intervention, a time when a new life is carefully formed and nurtured. Here are some more verses that reference pregnancy:\n\n1. Surah Al-Haj (22:5):\n\n\"O People, if you should be in doubt about the Resurrection, then [consider that] indeed, We created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clot, and then from a lump of flesh, formed and unformed - that We may show you. And We settle in the wombs whom We will for a specified term, then We bring you out as a child, and then [We develop you] that you may reach your [time of] maturity. And among you is he who is taken in [early] death, and among you is he who is returned to the most decrepit [old] age so that he knows, after [once having] knowledge, nothing. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and swells and grows [something] of every beautiful kind.\"\n\nThis Ayah describes the stages of human development from conception to maturity, again highlighting the miraculous nature of life.\n\n2. Surah Aal-E-Imran (3:6):\n\n\"He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"\n\nThis verse speaks to the divine intervention during the formation of a baby in the womb, expressing that every creation is by God's design.\n\n3. Surah Al-A'raf (7:189):\n\n\"It is He who created you from a single soul, and made from it its mate, that he might dwell with her. When he covers her, she carries a light burden and continues with it. When it becomes heavy, they pray to Allah their Lord, 'If You give us a good [child], we will surely be among the grateful.'\"\n\nThis Ayah acknowledges the difficulties of pregnancy and encourages couples to pray for a healthy child, emphasizing the importance of gratitude.\n\nThese Ayahs shed light on the Islamic understanding of pregnancy, emphasizing the role of God in creating and forming life and urging believers to express gratitude for the miracle of life. They also recognize the challenges of pregnancy, presenting them as part of the divine plan.",

Surah Az-Zumar (39:6):\n\n\"He created you from one soul. Then He made from it its mate, and He produced for you from the livestock eight mates. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, within three darknesses. That is Allah, your Lord; to Him belongs dominion. There is no deity except Him, so how are you averted?\"\n\nThis verse speaks to the miraculous process of creation in the womb, noting the stages of development and the complexities involved.\n\n3. Surah Luqman (31:14):\n\n\"And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination.\"\n\nThis verse draws attention to the struggles and sacrifices a mother undergoes during pregnancy and emphasizes the importance of gratitude and respect for parents.\n\nThese verses from the Quran indeed present pregnancy as a period of divine intervention, highlighting the miracle of creating life. They show the stages of human development, emphasizing the complexity and beauty of this natural process, along with the hardships and sacrifices it may involve.",
