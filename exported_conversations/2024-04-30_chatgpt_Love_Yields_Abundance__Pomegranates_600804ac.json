      "content": "Your haiku has a great theme and vivid imagery. Here are some suggestions to refine it while maintaining its original spirit and ensuring it adheres to the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure:\n\n1. **The Prophet (S) says: Plant**\n2. **Love yields abundance here**\n3. **Like pomegranates**\n\nThis revision keeps your original first line, modifies the second for syllable count and clarity, and maintains the simile of pomegranates in the third line, which ties beautifully with the theme of growth and abundance.",
