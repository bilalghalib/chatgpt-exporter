They want to know how to respond to children who are experiencing war and trauma to be more supportive as teachers. My workshop is about focusing on the research around post traumatic growth that i learned teaching in lebanon and knowing the importance of connection, dliberate rumination, as well as preventing polyvagal freeze states by opening space for art, humor, and expression - how do these ideas relate to the muslim tradition, particularly from the islamic psychology perspective?\n\n",

Interest piqued?\n\n**Finding support**\n\nI’m gathering Quranic verses and hadiths that underscore the importance of patience, compassion, and helping others. These teachings highlight the core values and encourage positive behavior.\n\n**Examining reflections**\n\nHm, I’m thinking about how Islamic tradition values reflection and empathy. The Quran mentions considering creation, while a hadith highlights mutual support. The Prophet even showed humor.",

      "content": "Islamic teachings offer profound insights into coping with hardship, fostering resilience, and supporting others through trials—principles that align closely with modern approaches to trauma support and post-traumatic growth. Integrating Islamic principles, Hadiths, and Quranic verses into your workshop can provide culturally and spiritually resonant strategies for teachers in Gaza to support children experiencing war and trauma.\n\n### **1. Emphasizing Patience and Perseverance (Sabr)**\n\n**Quranic Verses:**\n\n- **\"O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.\"**  \n  *(Quran 2:153)*\n\n- **\"So verily, with hardship, there is relief. Verily, with hardship, there is relief.\"**  \n  *(Quran 94:5-6)*\n\nThese verses highlight the concept of *sabr* (patience), encouraging individuals to endure hardships with steadfastness, knowing that relief will follow. This aligns with the idea of fostering resilience and hope in children facing trauma.\n\n### **2. The Importance of Reflection and Deliberate Rumination (Tafakkur)**\n\n**Quranic Verses:**\n\n- **\"Do they not reflect upon themselves?\"**  \n  *(Quran 30:8)*\n\n- **\"Those who remember Allah while standing or sitting or [lying] on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth...\"**  \n  *(Quran 3:191)*\n\nIslam encourages *tafakkur* (deep contemplation), which parallels the concept of deliberate rumination in trauma psychology. Encouraging children to reflect on their experiences in a guided and supportive manner can facilitate healing and personal growth.\n\n### **3. Compassion and Mercy (Rahma) Towards Others**\n\n**Quranic Verses:**\n\n- **\"And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.\"**  \n  *(Quran 21:107)*\n\n- **\"And lower your wing to those who follow you of the believers.\"**  \n  *(Quran 26:215)*\n\n**Hadith:**\n\n- **\"The believers, in their mutual kindness, compassion, and sympathy, are just like one body...\"**  \n  *(Sahih Bukhari and Muslim)*\n\nThese teachings emphasize the importance of showing compassion and kindness, which is essential for teachers supporting traumatized children. Creating a nurturing environment aligns with the Islamic value of *rahma*.\n\n### **4. Utilizing Art, Humor, and Expression**\n\nWhile not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, the use of creative expression is supported by the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) appreciation for poetry and permissible forms of art.\n\n**Hadith:**\n\n- **The Prophet allowed the playing of the duff (a hand drum) during celebrations and did not object to the singing of poetry that was morally acceptable.**  \n  *(Sahih Bukhari)*\n\n- **Anas ibn Malik reported that a man asked the Prophet for a mount. The Prophet jokingly replied, \"I will give you the offspring of a she-camel.\" The man said, \"What will I do with the offspring of a she-camel?\" The Prophet said, \"Are camels born from anything other than she-camels?\"**  \n  *(Tirmidhi)*\n\nThese instances show that humor and artistic expression are acceptable and can be beneficial in easing tension and fostering a positive environment, aiding in preventing states of emotional freeze by engaging children in creative activities.\n\n### **5. Building Community and Social Support**\n\n**Quranic Verses:**\n\n- **\"And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.\"**  \n  *(Quran 3:103)*\n\n- **\"Help one another in acts of righteousness and piety.\"**  \n  *(Quran 5:2)*\n\nCommunity support is crucial in Islamic teachings. Encouraging collective activities and peer support among children can strengthen their coping mechanisms and foster a sense of belonging.\n\n### **6. Trust in Allah and Seeking His Help (Tawakkul)**\n\n**Quranic Verses:**\n\n- **\"And whoever relies upon Allah – then He is sufficient for him.\"**  \n  *(Quran 65:3)*\n\n- **\"Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.\"**  \n  *(Quran 13:11)*\n\nInstilling a sense of reliance on Allah can provide spiritual comfort to children, helping them navigate their trauma with faith and hope.\n\n### **7. Recognizing Personal Strength and Potential**\n\n**Quranic Verses:**\n\n- **\"Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.\"**  \n  *(Quran 2:286)*\n\nThis verse reassures individuals of their inherent strength to overcome challenges, aligning with the concept of post-traumatic growth by recognizing and building upon personal resilience.\n\n### **8. The Role of Remembrance and Mindfulness (Dhikr)**\n\n**Quranic Verses:**\n\n- **\"Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.\"**  \n  *(Quran 13:28)*\n\nIncorporating practices of *dhikr* can help in calming the mind and providing emotional relief, similar to mindfulness techniques used in trauma therapy.\n\n### **Islamic Psychology Perspective**\n\nIslamic psychology (*Ilm al-Nafs*) integrates spiritual and psychological well-being. It recognizes the multi-dimensional nature of the human soul, encompassing the mind (*aql*), heart (*qalb*), and spirit (*ruh*). Healing is approached holistically, considering emotional, spiritual, and social dimensions.\n\n- **Balance of the Self:** The concept of maintaining balance (*mizan*) within oneself is crucial. Teachers can help children achieve this balance through activities that promote emotional expression and spiritual grounding.\n\n- **Purification of the Heart (*Tazkiyah al-Qalb*):** Fostering purity and health of the heart by encouraging positive emotions and thoughts, which can be facilitated through supportive communication and expressive activities.\n\n### **Practical Applications for Teachers**\n\n- **Creating Safe Spaces:** Establish environments where children feel secure to express their feelings through art, storytelling, and play, reflecting the Islamic emphasis on compassion and community support.\n\n- **Encouraging Reflection:** Facilitate sessions where children can reflect on their experiences in a guided manner, aligning with the practice of *tafakkur*.\n\n- **Incorporating Faith-Based Comfort:** Use age-appropriate discussions about trust in Allah, patience, and hope to provide spiritual reassurance.\n\n- **Promoting Social Connection:** Organize group activities that strengthen peer relationships, reflecting the communal values emphasized in Islam.\n\n- **Using Humor Appropriately:** Integrate light-hearted moments to alleviate stress, following the Prophet’s example of using humor wisely and kindly.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy integrating these Islamic principles into trauma-informed educational practices, teachers can provide culturally sensitive support that resonates deeply with the children's beliefs and values. This holistic approach not only addresses the psychological impacts of war and trauma but also reinforces the spiritual and communal bonds that are integral to healing in the Islamic tradition.",

      "content": "Here is some content you can use to get ideas from:\n\"\"\"It's such an honor to be here and to\npresent with Shaykh Omar Suleiman and my good friend Sarah and to be talking\nabout a really important topic that we have that's not, it's very unaddressed\nand something that we're not talking about as much as we need to. Subhanallah \nwhen we look at the field of Islamic psychology, we're still in the infancy\nstages. It's not to say the scholars have not addressed it in the past but in\nterms of resources in English that are easy to understand for the average\nperson and they're easily accessible, there is very limited information on the\nintersectionality between Islam and trauma. Most of the therapists who do give talks,\nit's very, it's usually about the stigma of mental health, which is important. Or\nit could be about anxiety and Islam or depression in Islam-all very useful things\nbut subhanAllah trauma is such a major thing that people don't know that\nthey're experiencing and they don't know that it could be the underlying causes\nfor their anxiety or their depression. And so, you know, people are walking\naround they're walking around very vulnerable, they're walking around\nwounded, thinking there's something wrong with them when there isn't. It's just\nbecause they're not looking at it from the lens of trauma. And so if we have\npeople who are walking around traumatized, anxious, or depressed. Whether it's a big T trauma like Sarah said or a small T trauma, these\nindividuals, they need to be helped because, I mean, it's so much suffering to\nbe able to carry around that burden with you on a day to day basis. And then when\nwe look at the context of the family, we know that if one person in the family is\naffected, the whole family is affected. So trauma can also not just impact the\nindividual but we're looking also at maybe a wife not being able to connect\nwith her kids, or a husband not being able to connect with his wife all\nbecause of trauma, so it also is on the family level. And then you can take it a\nstep further and as Shaykh Omar Suleiman said, you know, we are a really\ntraumatized community and subhanallah, I can't even imagine that if our mental health was better,  if we would, I would imagine that we would\nbe in a much better framework to be able to tackle on these really big issues\nthat are at hand. But because we're so self-absorbed not necessarily in a bad\nway, in a narcissistic way, but in that we are so pained that we cannot look to\nother people, that we, it inhibits our ability to go and connect on a bigger\nscale. So some of the goals that Sarah and I had with the series was if we can\nget people to heal on a smaller scale that it can have a profound effect\nacross the entire ummah Inshallah. We also wanted to approach it from the\nperspective of Yaqeen and conviction. A lot of times trauma will be the\ntrigger for people leaving Islam and it's when they are in the midst of the\nstorm it's really hard to see out of it and if we can help some of these people\nwho are experiencing this trauma, I'm optimistic Inshallah that we can we\ncan help them and be able to address some of the people leaving the religion\nas the Shaykh had mentioned. So the framework for our series was the Duha\napproach and we wanted to find something that was Islamic but was also\npsychologically sound and when we look at Surah Al-Duha, subhanallah, you know\nit's 14 it's over 1,400 years old but it has, each ayah has an evidence-based\ntreatment that Allah, the creator of the universe, was comforting the Prophet (sallalahu alaihi wasalam), the best of mankind, and if we can take that model of Allah helping \nMuhammad (sallalahu alaihi wasalam) with his distress, we felt, Sarah and I felt that we can also\nuse this model for for ourselves. And just to give a little context with the\nsurah, the Prophet (sallalahu alaihi wasalam) was distressed for some time before the surah was\nrevealed to him. That's because there was a revelation for some time. And when you look at it through the lens of attachment which is a really big\nthing in psychology, , the Prophet (sallalahu alaihi wasalam) he had, he had lost his parents,\nhe lost his uncle, he lost his wife, he lost one of his sons. And so the idea of\nalso losing that connection to Allah must have been very, very hard for him. So\nI will read the English. We know Surah Al- Duha, (Arabic recitation of verse) and then Allah says, \"your Lord has not taken leave of you nor has he detested you,\" and Subhanallah it's really interesting that's\none of the first one of the first few ayahs of the Surah, because attachment is\nso paramount to, to our healing. It's not just, you know, Allah showing his\nattachment or comforting the Prophet (sallalahu alaihi wasalam) saying I have not abandoned you, I have not forsaken you. But we can also take the same, that and\nwhen we are in the midst of trauma, it feels like we're in a big storm and that\nwe cannot, we cannot get out. And so when we feel that connection to someone else\nit can have a really profound effect on on our healing. And so if you are someone\nwho has experienced trauma, know that you're not alone. You have people to help\nyou and more importantly, you have Allah to help you. He has not abandoned you\nduring the hard time and if you have a loved one who has experienced trauma,\nknowing the power of attachment and helping them can really help them\nsignificantly. So knowing by being there about being available to them, and\ncomforting them, sitting with them in their pain, can really make a huge\ndifference. And then the next ayah, \"and the hereafter is better for you than the\nfirst life and your Lord is going to give you and you will be satisfied.\" Perspective, shifting perspectives is a\nreally important tool in psychology. When we're in trauma, like I said, it feels\nvery overwhelming, very daunting, and looking to the future or looking to\nthe other side of the storm can really help lift us out of depression and trauma and so here, you know, Allah is telling the Prophet that it's going to\nget better, it's going to be better in the next life. And we know in \"inna ma'al usri yusrah, inna ma'al usri yusrah.\" So it's gonna get better here and Inshallah it will get better in the Hereafter. And then, and by the way I know I'm going over this very superficially. Inshallah\nyou can visit our article for more in-depth information. And then he says,\n\"did he not find you an orphan and give you refuge, and he found you lost and\nguided you, and he found you poor and made you self-sufficient.\" So one of the\nmajor things in our publication was that we wanted to integrate cognitive\nbehavioral therapy into our series and this is a very popular method in\npsychology where you kind of look at the origin of your thoughts, because your\nthoughts have a profound effect on your on your feelings, which has a big effect\non your behavior. So here, Subhanallah, Allah is is almost rephrasing, cognitively restructuring some of the\nProphet (sallalahu alaihi wasalam)'s  thoughts. So he's saying did he not find you an orphan and give you refuge? So the way cognitive behavioral therapy works is you look to\nyour thoughts, and you acknowledge them, but then when you are ready you start to\nshift them with healthier, with healthier cognitions. So if you're thinking, I'm\nnever gonna get through this. This is just the end of it, you're like no, Inshallah   things will get better. This is a really tough time in my life but I am\nlooking forward to X Y and Z and I do want to point out just a disclaimer. This is\nnot the first step in trauma treatment. You have to be able to attach, just the\nway a lot you know showed his connection to the Prophet (sallalahu alaihi wasalam),  you have to be able to attach with your family or friend, who's experiencing trauma first, or if you are experiencing trauma yourself you have to\nbe able to attach and, and feel secure with someone and process your trauma\nfirst, before you begin to do this and I just\nwant to point this out so people don't walk out of here thinking okay I'm gonna\ngo and cognitive restructuring everybody's thoughts. People are going to get very mad at yo.u\nSo this is a very important part of therapy and in healing but it's\ndefinitely not the first step and then Allah says, so for the orphan, so \"as for\nthe orphan, do not oppress him, and as for petitioner, do not repel him,\"\nand when we were doing, when we were working on the series Sarah pointed out\nthis is really behavioral activation. It's one thing to work on your thoughts\nbut then it's something else to go and take action. So as Sarah mentioned, \ntrauma stays on our body so once you begin to process it it's also important\nto go out and take action and the research shows if you go out and help\nother people it's, it has incredible benefits for your own mental health. And\nthen lastly, \"but as for the favor of your Lord, report it.\" There's also research\nthat shows people who use gratitude lists or gratitude letters, meaning that\nyou might write a letter to someone and express how grateful you are to them, or\nmaybe before you go to sleep you think about three things that you're grateful\nfor or just even make a list, but this has really profound mental health\nbenefits. And so SubhanAllah like you see all these evidence-based treatments\nthroughout these ayahs and this is just scratching the surface. There's so much\nmore to it so what are some of the just takeaways that we can have is that if\nyou're an individual, you are not alone. Allah has not forsaken you. There is help\navailable and Allah is available to help you too.\nYou just have to reach out to him. And if you have a loved one, again that's, that\nhas experienced trauma, think about the power of attachment. I'm imagining\nthere's probably a lot of people here who do volunteer work, who maybe even\nare physicians. There's something called trauma-informed care. And so if you're\nworking with people who have a lot of trauma it's important to be able to kind\nof read up on that and know how you as whether as a physician or a volunteer can be able to help people without accidentally\nre-traumatising them. And then lastly on a community level, you know, we just hope\nthat we can find a way to incorporate these principles so we can all heal\ntogether Inshallah. I do want to, oh actually there\nis one important thing, especially if you are in the work of Dawah, I think I had\nmentioned this before. So trauma can be something that comes before people leave\nIslam but interestingly enough it can also be something that leads people to Islam. So if you are in Dawah work, knowing trauma-informed care is very very\nimportant to make sure that you are not accidentally saying things or doing\nthings that might lead people away from Islam. But just to leave off on a\npositive note there was a research review and they showed that fifty\npercent of people who experience trauma actually ended up better than they were\nbefore. So it wasn't that they were back to the same functioning that they had\nbefore but they were actually better than when they first had the trauma. So\nyou can look at 50 percent and say, oh that's not good, but you can also look at\nand say 50 percent, that's not too bad. And SubhanAllah if we work together I'm\noptimistic, Inshalah, maybe we can increase it to 75 percent, the more we\nhave, you know, talks like this and can have publications where people can\nread up more about trauma and how it can impact the community. So how can people\nhave post-traumatic growth. Through tribulations people might find that they\nare stronger than before. They might find new relationships through their trauma.\nThey might have a stronger relationship with Allah subhana wata'ala. So trauma is\nnot a death sentence. It could be the beginning of an amazing growth opportunity as well. So check out our series Inshallah for much more in-depth information. I just kind of went over everything very\nquickly. And may Allah help us all heal\nindividually and collectively inshallah. (Applause) \"\"\"\n\"\"\"i am a licensed clinical social worker i'm a psychotherapist in private practice in maryland and inshallah today i will be talking about the approach for addressing trauma from a psycho-spiritual framework this is a topic that my colleague sar sultan and i have been working on for the past couple of years in terms of publishing an article series about this very topic and presenting at a major muslim conventions about the integration of the psychospiritual framework with working in trauma and so very excited today inshallah to be able to talk to you about this framework so what is the approach when we look in the quran and specifically as we can see that there is an evidence-based therapeutic framework in in terms of dealing with complex trauma and that muslim conditions can really derive some key strategies in terms of addressing trauma from a faith-based perspective based off of the surah and one of the most beautiful and powerful things about this surah is that we have allah the creator of the universe who knows best comforting the prophet saws during a time of distress and uh when we look at the context of the life of the prophet saws subhanallah he has had many uh events that would be considered traumatic uh orphan hood severe poverty being a victim of physical assault emotional abuse he also went to war you know has seen death lost people who are very close to him so when we look at allah giving support and comfort to the prophet sassam who had endured all these things but his distress was specific to this to this moment in which the the surah was revealed we can see techniques that are very effective and presenting we can see that they are evidence-based and that there is research to support these interventions not that that allah needs uh research or or evidence to support what he does but the fact that there is secular research that supports these strategies is amazing and so we have coined the strategies collectively as the duha approach and so we hope that with this doha approach that this can be a good stepping stone insha'allah for clinicians and researchers to be able to address trauma from an islamic perspective which is really not present in the clinical literature at this time so inshallah i'm going to talk a little bit more about uh islamic integration of the support of this approach the whole thing is based off of asura so i don't know if you can get have more islamic integration than that um but i will go into this word just very briefly and talk about the interventions that we can pull based off of this so it starts out with a sejja by the morning brightness and by the night when it covers when it covers with darkness and so we start out with the surah with uh with hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel and then it goes directly into your lord has not forsaken you nor has he detested you and this is such a profound ayah in terms of trauma and spirituality so many of our clients when they experience trauma one of the first things that they think of is did i do something wrong is there a punishment does allah hate me um is there something wrong with me and so here we have allah telling the prophet i send them he has not forsaken him and we know that just because something bad or traumatic happens to you it doesn't mean that allah has forsaken the person and so we can really drive this home with clients when they start to develop spiritual you know cognitive distortions or cognitive dissonance after a traumatic experience it really also drives home the idea of attachment and so you know when we experience trauma a lot of times we feel uh maybe that allah has forsaken us but also we feel um perhaps that there might be some kind of uh disruption in attachment with allah so in our work with our clients it's important not only to work on attachment with people in their lives immediately but also attachment with allah too and we know that some of the attachment uh also in the combinations that we have about attachment from our surroundings can also affect uh our cognitions about allah and our attachment with allah so they they go hand in hand and this is really uh it can be a very important thing for clinicians to utilize in trauma treatment and then the um the next day after that is and the hereafter is better for you than the first life and your lord is and your lord is going to give you and you will be satisfied and you know what this does is it really talks about perspective and whether you know you're looking at cognitive therapy dialectical behavioral therapy acceptance commitment therapy you're looking at shifting perspective that when we are in the midst of tremendous grief or trauma anxiety depression it feels like we're never going to get out that we are completely overwhelmed with these emotions and this perspective it shows you know this perspective helps show that feelings and the things that we're going through are temporary and that they will get better but i think also in that that this area takes it further that not necessarily that after trauma there there is life and things can get better but even if there is injustice in this dunya or things don't get better in this dunya there is the achara for justice there is the achara where we will feel contentment and safety um and so uh this ayah really illustrates uh you know perspective um looking at things from a different perspective and then the next day after that is did he know find you an orphan and give you free refuge and he found you lost and guided you and he found you poor and made you self-sufficient and really what this is is when you look at it it's very similar to cognitive therapy you know allah is directly working with the cognitions of the prophesizer and gently reshaping uh his perspective about things so we know with all the different interventions with trauma that cognitive therapy does have a place in terms of looking at all the unhealthy cognitions that can result from our pain and from our world being completely shaken up and that cognitive therapy can help us uh help heal us and then the next day after that so as for the orphan do not oppress him and as for the petitioner do not repel him and this really uh reminded us of behavioral activation in that you know a lot of times we work with our patients in terms of healing them so they can go back to life and do the things that they want to do but also it goes the other way around and in that sometimes we have to make goals and we have to we have to take action in order for the healing to take effect and then lastly and as for the favor of your lord report it and you know this really goes to and this really illustrates uh the importance of gratitude and you know in the research it's very clear even if you take faith out of it the importance of gratitude in healing and just in mental wellness in general um so in terms of islamic integration the doha approach is really a holistic model where it integrates the mind the body and the heart and this ties spirituality into trauma work which is often overlooked it took a while took um not just until like maybe a few decades ago for people to really implement the body into trauma work but the heart is still overlooked and this is something very important something that our clients are really yearning and looking for in terms of tying that spirituality into trauma work um you know this model teaches that muslims that there's many types of trauma and that the prophets uh experience events that would be considered traumatic not just the prophet saws but when you look at even prophet yusuf for example being abandoned by his brothers almost killed going into slavery being imprisoned and so it shows that um you know trauma is not for bad people or for for people that allah has forsaken the best of mankind have experienced things in their lives that would be considered traumatic it also demonstrates muslims the concept of post-traumatic growth and living past life of trauma that not only can you come back to baseline but you can grow and spiritually you can grow holistically as a result of your trauma and be better off than you were before the model can also directly address faith-based doubts that come up with trauma and so again just because you've experienced trauma doesn't mean that allah has forsaken you and then lastly it completely debunks any notion that psychology islam cannot be put together and this is a myth whether we like it or not that continues to exist in muslim communities where people think psychology is haram or or therapy is haram and so here we can see seamlessly and beautifully how psychology islam can be interwoven so what would this look like in terms of practical clinical application so in the office this is really for clients who want to use a model obviously you wouldn't use this approach for people who are not interested in integrating spirituality into into their treatment and so a clinician you know when they are working with a client they can provide psychoeducation on this model uh of treatment and that the model in of itself can be therapeutic and grounding just being able to go back to the surah and seeing some of these things with their own eyes and and revisiting it when they are feeling distressed can be very um calming and reassuring and this model will be used with standard trauma work so it's not to say that um you know it's a standalone and it would work by itself you would still use it with with regular travel work so you'd be working on stabilization emotion regulation making sure that the client uh is able to self-soothe and and being able to work on that first then the trauma work and then integration so the daha principles can be integrated throughout as appropriate uh in terms of theory uh we can see that there is a place for cognitive behavioral theory for cognitive theory and therapy uh to be able to use uh to be able to correct unhealthy thoughts or cognitive distortions that come up about faith as a result of trauma so here we're connecting theory we're protecting the surah and theory and then the practical application and then also attachment work in terms of um using uh that attachment work that we typically use with uh maybe a family of origin uh or a spouse or a parent or whatnot and using that to help a client repair or improve their relationship with allah after some kind of traumatic incident and some other just notes how we can continue to integrate spirituality into trauma work especially with this model is that we can use profit stories to be able to establish hope and triumph over adversity also this you know creates space in terms of integrating ayat and hadith for healing that we're not just using the quran and hadith from left field um it it goes very nicely in terms of the rest of the framework and then lastly we can use this framework to empower clients not just to use spirituality for healing but then also for spiritual growth as a person afterwards so not just for getting back to baseline but again for post-traumatic growth so that the person can be in a better hosted place than they were before so to conclude there really isn't a lot of research and writing addressing trauma from a spiritual perspective and definitely not from an islamic perspective really does provide a holistic framework in terms of dealing with complex trauma it really integrates that the trauma work with the mind and the body and and the heart and techniques that we can see from the sword are not only effective but evidence-based that would be you know shifting perspective cognitive therapy behavioral activation cultivating gratitude and so we encourage clinicians and researchers to expand on this work in terms of you know creating more literature um and evidence-based practices uh that tie in trauma with faith as i mentioned before my colleague sarah sultan and i we created a a series it's a video and article series it's titled your lord has not forsaken you addressing the impact of trauma on faith that can be found on ukraineinstitute.org specifically for clients who want to work on cognitive distortions from this perspective and it's really nice in that each chapter also has a workbook kind of um end to it in in which that they're not just reading through uh the article but they're also able to work on their cognitions uh with a therapist um or on their own if that's something that they uh that they would like to do not that it's a substitute for therapy we again you can find that on yourcleaninstitute.org it was great being able to uh share this with you and we look forward to your questions \"\"\"\n\nRemember this is in an active war context where teachers are working in pop-up school spaces\nwhat new insights can we extract from this content and what framework can orgnaize

Addressing trauma via the Duha approach, centered on Surah Al-Duha, is essential.\n\n**Gathering insights**\n\nI’m thinking about how gratitude and the Quran's message can uplift individuals, especially teachers in Gaza, fostering resilience and letting them heal while focusing on post-traumatic growth.\n\n**Crowdsourcing resilience elements**\n\nListing elements fostering resilience and post-traumatic growth, like social support, cognitive processing, and meaning-making, and thinking through their organization around these themes.\n\n**Emphasizing attachment and cognitive reframing**\n\nFocusing on attachment and connection, akin to the Prophet's reassurance, helps children feel safe and supported. Teachers foster cognitive reframing and use cognitive behavioral techniques to reshape thoughts, emphasizing resilience and future possibilities.\n\n**Highlighting key themes**\n\nI'm working through various concepts like behavioral activation for healing, gratitude's mental health benefits, and integrating spirituality into trauma work. Community support and trauma-informed care are essential topics as well.\n\n**Developing a framework**\n\nI’m crafting a framework for promoting resilience and post-traumatic growth in children, focusing on attachment, cognitive processing, and reframing using Islamic teachings.\n\n**Integrating Islamic principles**\n\nI’m emphasizing the use of Islamic teachings to foster resilience, emotional regulation, and community support among children. This approach aims to nurture meaningful experiences and a sense of agency.\n\n**Integrating Islamic teachings**\n\nI’m analyzing how Islamic teachings, especially Surah Al-Duha, can enhance a trauma-informed care framework. This integration fosters resilience and post-traumatic growth for children in conflict zones.",

      "content": "Certainly! In the context of teachers working with traumatized children in Gaza's active war zones, it's crucial to integrate both evidence-based psychological practices and culturally relevant, faith-based approaches. The content you've provided offers valuable insights into how Islamic principles, particularly those derived from Surah Al-Duha, can be woven into a framework that promotes resilience and post-traumatic growth among children. Below, I will extract key insights from the content and organize them into a practical framework aligned with established elements that foster resilience and post-traumatic growth.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insights Extracted from the Content**\n\n1. **The Importance of Attachment and Connection**\n\n   - **Allah's Assurance to the Prophet**: In Surah Al-Duha, Allah assures the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that He has not forsaken him, emphasizing the importance of secure attachment.\n   - **Application**: Building strong, supportive relationships with children can provide a sense of safety and security, essential for healing from trauma.\n\n2. **Shifting Perspectives and Cognitive Reframing**\n\n   - **Perspective in Adversity**: Allah reminds the Prophet that the Hereafter is better, shifting focus from present hardships to future hope.\n   - **Application**: Helping children reframe their experiences and focus on hope and future possibilities can alleviate feelings of helplessness.\n\n3. **Cognitive Behavioral Techniques**\n\n   - **Reflecting on Past Blessings**: Allah asks the Prophet to recall past instances where He provided support.\n   - **Application**: Encouraging children to recognize their strengths and past successes fosters resilience and positive self-perception.\n\n4. **Behavioral Activation and Engagement**\n\n   - **Encouraging Positive Actions**: Allah instructs the Prophet to actively help others (e.g., not oppressing the orphan).\n   - **Application**: Engaging children in helping behaviors and interactive activities can empower them and promote healing.\n\n5. **Cultivating Gratitude and Positive Emotions**\n\n   - **Expressing Gratitude**: Allah encourages the Prophet to proclaim His blessings.\n   - **Application**: Practicing gratitude can enhance well-being and foster positive emotions in children.\n\n6. **Integrating Spirituality and Meaning-Making**\n\n   - **Spiritual Connection**: The Surah ties spiritual reassurance with emotional healing.\n   - **Application**: Incorporating Islamic teachings can help children find meaning in their experiences and strengthen their spiritual resilience.\n\n7. **Community and Social Support**\n\n   - **Collective Healing**: Emphasis on the broader impact of individual healing on the community.\n   - **Application**: Fostering a supportive classroom environment encourages collective resilience.\n\n8. **Potential for Post-Traumatic Growth**\n\n   - **Growth After Trauma**: Recognition that trauma can lead to personal development and stronger faith.\n   - **Application**: Highlighting stories of overcoming adversity can inspire hope and motivation in children.\n\n9. **Trauma-Informed Care Principles**\n\n   - **Understanding Trauma Impact**: Awareness of how trauma affects thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n   - **Application**: Teachers adopting trauma-informed approaches can create safer learning environments.\n\n10. **Art, Humor, and Creative Expression**\n\n    - **Preventing Emotional \"Freeze\" States**: Using creative outlets to process emotions.\n    - **Application**: Incorporating art, play, and humor helps children express feelings and reduces stress.\n\n---\n\n### **Framework for Promoting Resilience and Post-Traumatic Growth**\n\nBased on the insights above, the following framework can guide teachers in supporting traumatized children:\n\n#### **1. Establish Secure Attachments**\n\n- **Build Trusting Relationships**: Show consistent care and concern to help children feel safe.\n- **Islamic Principle**: Emulate Allah's assurance to the Prophet that He has not forsaken him.\n\n#### **2. Facilitate Cognitive Reframing**\n\n- **Encourage Positive Thinking**: Help children reinterpret negative thoughts and focus on hopeful aspects.\n- **Techniques**: Use storytelling and discussions to shift perspectives.\n\n#### **3. Integrate Spirituality and Faith**\n\n- **Use Islamic Teachings**: Incorporate verses from the Quran and Hadith that promote hope and resilience.\n- **Meaning-Making**: Help children find purpose and understanding through their faith.\n\n#### **4. Promote Emotional Expression through Art and Play**\n\n- **Creative Activities**: Incorporate drawing, painting, storytelling, and play to allow emotional expression.\n- **Prevent Freeze States**: These activities can reduce feelings of helplessness and disengagement.\n\n#### **5. Encourage Gratitude and Positive Emotions**\n\n- **Gratitude Practices**: Have children share things they are thankful for.\n- **Positive Reinforcement**: Celebrate small achievements to boost morale.\n\n#### **6. Engage in Behavioral Activation**\n\n- **Active Participation**: Involve children in helping tasks or classroom responsibilities.\n- **Empowerment**: Foster a sense of agency and control over their environment.\n\n#### **7. Foster Community and Peer Support**\n\n- **Group Activities**: Encourage teamwork and collaboration.\n- **Peer Support**: Facilitate discussions where children can share experiences and support each other.\n\n#### **8. Teach Emotional Regulation Skills**\n\n- **Mindfulness Practices**: Simple breathing exercises or quiet reflection.\n- **Islamic Practices**: Introduce age-appropriate forms of remembrance (dhikr) to calm the mind.\n\n#### **9. Highlight Stories of Resilience**\n\n- **Role Models**: Share stories of the Prophets and companions who overcame adversity.\n- **Inspiration**: Use these narratives to instill hope and demonstrate the potential for growth.\n\n#### **10. Apply Trauma-Informed Educational Practices**\n\n- **Safety and Predictability**: Maintain a structured and predictable classroom environment.\n- **Sensitivity**: Be aware of triggers and avoid re-traumatization.\n- **Professional Development**: Teachers should receive training on trauma-informed care principles.\n\n---\n\n### **Application in Pop-Up School Spaces**\n\nGiven the constraints of working in pop-up school environments in active war zones, the framework emphasizes adaptability and practicality:\n\n- **Flexible Scheduling**: Allow for breaks and adjust activities based on children's emotional states.\n- **Resourcefulness**: Use available materials for art and play (e.g., drawing in the sand, storytelling).\n- **Community Involvement**: Engage local community members or parents when possible to strengthen support networks.\n- **Self-Care for Teachers**: Recognize that teachers are also affected by the trauma and need support to effectively help children.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy integrating the Duha approach and Islamic principles with evidence-based psychological practices, teachers can create a supportive and healing environment for children experiencing trauma in Gaza. This framework not only addresses the immediate emotional and psychological needs of the children but also fosters resilience and the potential for post-traumatic growth. Emphasizing attachment, cognitive reframing, spirituality, emotional expression, and community support can help children navigate their experiences and emerge stronger. Teachers play a pivotal role in this process, and with the right tools and understanding, they can make a profound difference in the lives of these young individuals.\n\n---\n\n**Note to Teachers:** Remember that your presence and compassion are powerful tools in healing. By embodying the principles outlined above, you provide not just education but also hope and stability in uncertain times. Your efforts contribute not only to the well-being of individual children but also to the strength and resilience of the entire community.",
