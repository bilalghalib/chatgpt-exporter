      "content": "For repairing a standard brown terracotta or ceramic plant pot, you want something that:  \n\n- Bonds well to porous clay/ceramic  \n- Can handle some water exposure (though ideally you keep the glued area dry)  \n- Dries strong and doesn’t shrink  \n\nHere are the best options depending on your needs:  \n\n**1. For a quick, strong fix:**  \n- **Two-part epoxy** (like *Loctite Epoxy Instant Mix*, *JB Weld ClearWeld*, or *Araldite Standard*) — very strong bond, fills gaps well, water-resistant once cured.  \n- Mix the resin and hardener, apply to both surfaces, press together, and clamp or hold in place until it sets (usually 5–10 minutes for initial grip, 24 hrs for full cure).  \n\n**2. For something waterproof and more flexible:**  \n- **Marine epoxy** — especially good if the pot will be outside and exposed to wet soil and rain.  \n\n**3. For a less messy, smaller break:**  \n- **Super glue / cyanoacrylate** (*Loctite Super Glue Gel Control*, *Gorilla Super Glue Gel*) — works if the break is clean and you can press the pieces tightly together, but it’s more brittle and less gap-filling than epoxy.  \n\n**Extra tip:**  \n- Lightly sand the edges of the broken area to remove dust, then clean with a damp cloth and let dry fully before gluing — terracotta holds dust that weakens the bond.  \n- If you want extra strength, you can glue and then reinforce the inside of the pot seam with a thin layer of epoxy mixed with a bit of sand.  \n\nIf the pot will be constantly wet, epoxy will last much longer than super glue.  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can give you a **step-by-step repair method** that makes the crack almost invisible. Would you like me to do that?",

      "content": "If it’s going to be wet — especially with soil and water inside — then you’ll want **waterproof epoxy**, not super glue.  \n\nFor a terracotta or cheap ceramic plant pot, the best long-lasting repair would be:  \n\n### **Recommended glues**  \n- **JB Weld WaterWeld** (putty-style epoxy, great for filling gaps, waterproof once cured)  \n- **Loctite Marine Epoxy** (liquid epoxy, bonds ceramic and is waterproof)  \n- **Gorilla Epoxy** (resists water, but make sure it’s the *clear* or *marine* version)  \n\n### **How to repair so it survives wet use**  \n1. **Clean the broken surfaces**  \n   - Brush or sand off dust.  \n   - Wipe with a damp cloth and let it dry completely.  \n\n2. **Mix epoxy** (or knead if it’s a putty)  \n   - Follow the product’s instructions carefully.  \n   - If using putty, knead until the color is uniform.  \n\n3. **Apply generously**  \n   - Get epoxy into all cracks and gaps.  \n   - Press pieces together firmly.  \n\n4. **Reinforce inside**  \n   - Spread a thin “fillet” of epoxy along the inside seam.  \n   - This adds strength and prevents water from seeping directly into the crack.  \n\n5. **Cure fully**  \n   - Leave undisturbed for at least 24 hours before adding soil or water.  \n   - Most marine epoxies take 24–72 hours for maximum strength.  \n\n---\n\nIf the crack is big or there are missing pieces, I can give you a **repair + seal method** using epoxy and waterproof tile grout so it’s almost as strong as new.  \n\nDo you want me to give you that heavy-duty version? It’s overkill, but perfect for a wet pot.",
