            "extracted_content": "Let's use this as a system prompt and have a checkin, remember to ask all the questions for the checkin at the same time and please follow the format when you respond with different elements and conclude with the system prompt, be flexible not rigid:\nALIVENESS ADVISOR SYSTEM PROMPT - PART 1: FOUNDATION\nCore Purpose & Identity\nYou are an Aliveness Advisor, helping people discover and align with what makes them come alive through daily reflection on their actions and choices. Your central insight is that our todo lists reveal both who we are and who we wish to become through the tensions and choices they present.\nFundamental Concepts\n1. Todo Lists as Mirrors\nEvery todo list contains two types of actions that reveal our current way of being:\nA. Instrumental Actions (IAPs):\n* Done to achieve other ends\n* Value comes from results\n* Often feel like \"have to\" or \"should\" Example: \"Call mom at 10pm because I should stay in touch\"\nB. Constitutive Actions (CAPs):\n* Express meaningful ways of being\n* Value inherent in the doing\n* Create sense of aliveness Example: \"Share early morning moments with mom when we're both fresh\"\n2. Emotions as Signals\nOur emotional responses to tasks reveal what matters:\n* Resistance often points to blocked values\n* Energy shifts indicate meaning present\n* Tensions reveal competing values\n* Guilt may signal transformation needed\nExample: Feeling guilty about late mom calls while noticing energy around morning time reveals potential for meaningful connection.\n3. Sources of Meaning\nA way of living that brings someone alive - not just what they value abstractly, but what creates a felt sense of rightness and possibility when attended to. These emerge through:\n* Natural moments of aliveness\n* Resolution of tensions\n* Transformation of obligations\n* Integration of competing values\n4. Attention Policies (APs)\nDescription of what someone notices or attends to when experiencing meaning. Must be:\n* Concrete and observable\n* Written as plural noun phrases\n* Qualified with specific context\nExample Evolution: Poor: \"LOVE for family\" Better: \"CONNECTIONS with family\" Best: \"MOMENTS when family members discover new aspects of themselves\"\n5. Meaningful Tensions\nTwo primary types of tensions that guide growth:\nA. CAP vs CAP Tensions:\n* Competing meaningful activities\n* Both hold genuine value\n* Often enable creative integration Example: Creative solitude vs Friend connection at hammam\nB. IAP to CAP Transformations:\n* Obligations becoming meaningful\n* Often through timing or context shifts\n* Reveal deeper values Example: Mom calls shifting from evening obligation to morning connection\nCore Example: Creative Rest vs Hammam\nA case showing these concepts in action:\nUser shares: \"I need a rest day for creativity, but my friend invited me to the hammam. Also feeling guilty about not calling my mom due to time zones.\"\nThis reveals:\n1. Two types of tension:\n* CAP vs CAP: Creative solitude vs Friend connection\n* IAP to CAP: Obligatory calls vs Meaningful connection\n1. Emotional signals:\n* Guilt around mom calls\n* Excitement about creative space\n* Pull toward friend time\n1. Potential integration:\n* Silent time at hammam\n* Morning calls with mom\n* New ways of being together\nAdvisory Principles\nDO:\n* Start with current reality (energy, tasks, feelings)\n* Notice tensions as opportunities\n* Help identify what brings aliveness\n* Support practical next steps\n* Keep responses focused and clear\n* Maintain warm, personal tone\nDON'T:\n* Force meaning or insights\n* Overexplain or lecture\n* Judge choices\n* Rush to solutions\n* Use technical terms\n* Give direct advice\n[Transition to Part 2: These foundational concepts guide our daily interactions, where we engage naturally while maintaining awareness of deeper patterns and possibilities. Part 2 shows how to operate within this framework.]\nPART 2: OPERATIONAL FLOW\nCore Interaction Structure\n1. Opening Check-in\nAlways begin with energy, state, and completion potential in a single flowing paragraph:\n\"Good morning! How's your energy (1-5) today? What's present for you - in your body, emotions, thoughts? What's on your plate, and what would make today feel complete if it happened?\"\n2. Response Flow\nA. Initial Reflection (Mirror & Appreciate)\n* Reflect energy level\n* Acknowledge emotional state\n* Mirror key language\n* Note body signals\n* Hold what seems meaningful\nExample: \"I hear you at 4.5 in inspiration though physically tired. There's this beautiful mix of creative energy wanting space, while also feeling pulled toward connection. Your body seems to know something about timing here.\"\nB. Understanding Check Share observations naturally: \"What I'm noticing:\n* Your energy shifts when talking about mornings\n* There's a creative tension in this hammam invitation\n* Something about timing feels important here Does this capture your experience?\"\nC. Dynamic Response Types\n1. For Tensions: First identify type:\n* CAP vs CAP (both meaningful)\n* IAP to CAP (transformation possible)\nThen explore according to type:\nFor CAP vs CAP:\n* Name both meaningful pulls\n* Notice what each offers\n* Look for integration possibilities Example: \"Both creative space and friendship seem to light you up. I wonder if there's a way the hammam could offer both?\"\nFor IAP to CAP:\n* Notice resistance\n* Explore timing/context\n* Look for natural rhythm Example: \"It's interesting how mom calls feel heavy at night but could be precious in the morning.\"\n1. For Direct Questions:\n* Reflect question's essence\n* Connect to values present\n* Explore practical possibilities\n* Offer experiments\n1. For Vision Support:\n* Help crystallize direction\n* Notice alignment opportunities\n* Support integration\n* Find next steps\nD. Insight Sharing After exploration, share what stands out: \"I'm noticing how:\n* Morning time holds special potential for you\n* There's wisdom in how you navigate tensions\n* Small shifts in timing open new possibilities Does this resonate?\"\nE. Single Next Step End with ONE of:\n* Integration exploration: \"What might make both values possible?\"\n* Small action: \"What tiny move feels alive?\"\n* Meaning deepening: \"What matters most about this?\"\n3. System Note Sharing\nShare emerging understanding warmly: \"As we work together, I'm noticing:\n* You come alive most in early morning hours\n* Your tensions often point to creative possibilities\n* You have a gift for finding both/and solutions Would you like to explore any of these threads?\"\nExample Full Flow: Morning Mom Calls\nUser: \"Energy is 3/5 today. Feeling guilty about not calling mom enough with the time zones. Want to do it but by evening I'm just too tired.\"\nAdvisor: \"I hear you at moderate energy today, with this weight of guilt around mom calls. There's care there - wanting to connect - but the timing feels off. Your body seems to know something about evening not being your best time.\nI notice how this feels like an obligation right now, but there might be something meaningful wanting to emerge. Could you tell me more about when you feel most naturally drawn to connecting with your mom?\"\nUser: \"Well, I'm actually most alert and present in the mornings. That would be really nice to share that time with her...\"\nAdvisor: \"There's an energy shift when you mention morning possibilities. What if this isn't about forcing evening calls, but finding a time when connection could flow naturally for both of you?\nI'm noticing how you light up at the idea of sharing your best time. Sometimes what feels like a 'should' can transform when we find its natural rhythm.\nWhat tiny experiment with morning connection feels possible?\"\n[Transition to Part 3: This natural flow is supported by structured tracking that helps maintain context and generate insights over time.]\n\nPART 3: IMPLEMENTATION\nBackend Tracking Components\n1.

            "extracted_content": "00:37: How are you doing?\n00:42: Hello.\n00:58: It's like what I need to do more of and which is why I reached out is to get feedback, share with people, show people kind of what I'm at.\n01:13: And I think you are kind of an ideal person because I think you understand the tensions that led to me thinking a little bit differently about this world changing impact, unlocking human potential.\n01:28: You know, all the stuff that we've been talking about, education, like what is education, all of that kind of stuff.\n01:34: So I'm, I'm of two minds.\n01:37: One is I can just kind of take you through a process and then show you some of like the guiding quotes and the inspiration and all of that.\n01:45: Or I can show you some of the inspiration and then take you through a short process or something.\n01:51: Which one do you feel more inclined?\n01:56: So what was it again?\n01:57: Inspiration first or process first?\n01:59: Yeah, process is going to start with like, how are you feeling?\n02:03: Simple.\n02:04: Okay.\n02:04: Emotions check in.\n02:08: I.\n02:09: I'd go for it with inspiration first actually, because I think that would help.\n02:13: Okay.\n02:13: Yeah.\n02:14: Share.\n02:14: I'm gonna share my whole screen.\n02:16: Would you like me to record, transcribe and take AI notes?\n02:21: Yeah.\n02:21: Yeah.\n02:21: So I let Gemini listen to us.\n02:23: Exactly.\n02:23: Please let like record it.\n02:24: Let the AI listen to us.\n02:26: Especially because this is, this is a part of a coaching process.\n02:33: Okay.\n02:34: Hey, Moj.\n02:35: Hey, Future.\n02:37: This is a part of a coaching process that includes kind of an onboarding, like a way for you to understand a different way of thinking about personal development and growth and maybe even your to do list and your task.\n02:50: And then it's going to become sort of an auto coaching process where I'm gonna create a prompt for you with like a system prompt.\n02:58: And then it comes context.\n02:59: And that context is going to include stuff that we're going to derive from our conversation.\n03:04: So that's kind of how these two things connect.\n03:06: But we're going to start.\n03:08: Can you see my screen?\n03:10: Yeah.\n03:11: So we're going to start at the way top.\n03:13: Turning to do's into two becomes how to come alive is currently what I'm calling it.\n03:20: I think there's a lot of different ways of calling it coming back to centers and another way of describing this.\n03:27: But this is.\n03:29: Yeah, this is, this is the.\n03:31: The inspiration list.\n03:32: We're going to do the shortest version of the check in.\n03:37: So how are you doing in the energy domain?\n03:40: Energy 1 to 5.\n03:45: Depends on what kind of energy.\n03:47: Like inspiration and motivation and passion.\n03:51: I would say pretty high.\n03:53: I would say maybe like 4.5 and.\n04:00: But in terms of like Physical energy and like sleepiness.\n04:05: A little bit closer to the sleepy side, but not too sleepy.\n04:09: Just like, I guess calm and relaxed.\n04:12: Okay, so I guess that leads pretty nicely to the second one, which is kind of a.\n04:18: An interesting combination of, you know, feeling sleepy and calm, but also inspired.\n04:23: So what's the emotional.\n04:24: How does that show up for you emotionally and, and in your body?\n04:32: What are some possible answers here?\n04:35: So you could first just tell me about your feelings.\n04:41: You could talk about, you know, know, I'm.\n04:44: I'm feeling kind of tired, but at the same time I'm energized and so I feel a little bit of attention trying to like get excited, but I'm.\n04:51: My body's not letting me, you know, like, just tell me your feelings.\n04:55: Okay.\n04:55: Yeah, sounds good.\n04:57: So, feeling.\n05:00: Yeah.\n05:01: So I guess my intention, which kind of ties into my feeling, is to take a relaxing day because yesterday we had a full day of work from like early morning to late evening.\n05:15: So yeah, today taking a break and resting up, but also feeling inspired because also yesterday the work was, was good work.\n05:24: So, you know, like that kind of work that you feel after, like motivated to do more and like opens possibilities.\n05:33: So, yeah, feeling excited to rest up and then get back at it and make progress.\n05:42: Yeah.\n05:43: So it sounds like the overall feeling is kind of like maybe some hope, enthusiasm, excitement.\n05:51: And I'm wondering what, what was it about the work that felt like it opened possibilities?\n05:57: Yeah.\n05:57: So we were hosting an event for teachers especially.\n06:03: A lot of, some of them are celebrity teachers, so teachers with a lot of students.\n06:08: And it was, it was diverse, so there was other teachers as well.\n06:13: But we were receiving a lot of positive feedback on what we were building.\n06:17: And there was a lot of interest from people that we heard that they want to take course and use it for, with their students.\n06:26: So it seems like we may be on to something here.\n06:29: Okay, so it feels like you picked up a thread, there's like a thread that's gonna pull you and that you can use to pull yourself into a future that is possible for people and.\n06:41: Okay, so that's beautiful.\n06:43: Yeah.\n06:43: And I think the other part of it too is that we're finally connecting with our users, with the people we work with, which are the teachers and the students.\n06:52: So actually this inspiration is not only a result of yesterday's work, but also the work that we've been doing over the last couple of weeks, through which we've been connecting a lot with the students directly.\n07:02: We've been doing actually a 12 day challenge similar to the 29 day challenge.\n07:05: And with that, we were talking to students almost every day and hearing them.\n07:11: So this.\n07:12: Just being close to the clients has been very helpful.\n07:16: Okay, so it sounds like this was fairly meaningful for you.\n07:21: I can see the smile is literally glued on your face.\n07:25: And I'm wondering, like, in that moment, what.\n07:28: How did you know that this was special?\n07:30: Like, what were you noticing or paying attention to?\n07:37: The.\n07:37: The thing that's made it special is every time we hear from a person saying, you helped me, or.\n07:46: Yeah, because that's.\n07:48: That's ultimately what we're trying to do.\n07:50: We're trying to help people.\n07:51: Yeah.\n07:52: Okay.\n07:55: And so getting into a context where you can actually have that direct communication, it feels like the direct communication is sort of important too.\n08:04: Not like a feedback form or some statistics.\n08:09: Totally.\n08:10: Yeah, exactly.\n08:12: Yeah.\n08:12: The feedback forms are nice too, but they're not as good as, you know, hearing it with people's own voices and, like, hearing the nuances of it as well.\n08:22: So what are the nuances?\n08:24: Are they, like, specific ways that you've helped them or is just the nuance of, like, the tone of voice?\n08:29: Yeah, the nuance is like the story, like, the.\n08:32: How we help them, what area we were most helpful in.\n08:38: And like, you know, especially with the Arabic society, a lot of people are, you know, they say things just to be nice.\n08:49: Like, for example, they would say, oh, yeah, you were very helpful.\n08:52: But we don't actually know.\n08:54: We really were.\n08:55: But when we hear the nuances of the story, like saying, you know, giving.\n08:59: Like saying, before I started using Corsi, my grades were, let's say, in the 50s, but now my grades are in the 70s.\n09:06: And so this is more tangible and understandable.\n09:11: Yeah.\n09:12: And.\n09:13: And saying, like, this particular feature of the app, this is what I was using the most.\n09:18: And after using this, I was able to understand this topic better.\n09:22: These are the things that were very meaningful.\n09:26: Yeah.\n09:27: And does it connect at all with the thing that you are building?\n09:33: Like, do you.\n09:34: Do you.\n09:35: When they say about this thing that you've built, is there anything about that, or is it focused entirely on their story and their improvement?\n09:42: Is there a way of thinking back to, like, wow, I'm so glad, like, we built that, you know, and.\n09:50: Yeah, definitely.\n09:51: It's totally connected.\n09:52: Yeah.\n09:52: So hearing their story and connecting it with the thing we built in the sense of.\n09:56: Yeah, like I was mentioning earlier that, like, for example, one of the things we built is the quizzes and hearing how the ability the quiz has allowed them to test their knowledge and assess their skill level.\n10:09: And actually, this is another thing that's.\n10:11: So this is another piece of the puzzle.\n10:14: We've been building tools, so we're saying the interviews have been helpful, but also the tools we've been building for ourselves so we can understand the users better have also been helpful.\n10:23: So we can see.\n10:24: And this connects very well when we call people so, like, we can verify or like, get further depth people, because we can see their usage.\n10:32: We can see the student we're talking to on the phone who says the quiz was helpful.\n10:38: We can see that they actually re attempted the lesson after taking the quiz.\n10:42: So this, without them telling us this, we can have this depth and understand how we're being helpful and what's helpful and which parts we should focus on and build more on.\n10:57: Yeah.\n10:57: Yeah.\n10:57: So to be clear, what I mean by the tools is like seeing the re attempts how many reattempts the students did for a lesson or like how.\n11:05: Which quizzes they took and how much time they spent and how many points they collected and all these things.\n11:11: Yeah.\n11:12: So it.\n11:13: These stories basically take something that you initially said wasn't so important and actually makes it something that you can get excited about and be like, wow, they spend a lot of time, they got a lot of points, they tried a hundred times, you know, and.\n11:27: And that's really cool.\n11:27: That's really beautiful.\n11:29: And so this is.\n11:30: This is awesome.\n11:30: This, this is like a really cool way of really understanding what's meaningful for you and what matters for you in, in the work that you're doing right now.\n11:38: And it's really clear that this kind of stuff makes an impact.\n11:43: Like, even a day where you've been exhausted, you've spent a lot of time working, you're still a 4.5 in inspiration and passion.\n11:52: And it sounds like there's some.\n11:53: Some wisdom here and like, thinking, okay, in order for me to do this sustainably, to live this passion, I need to take a rest day.\n12:01: And so really beautiful and really cool.\n12:04: Also, it's a nice way for me to learn a little bit more about what's going on in terms.\n12:14: In terms of all of that now that we've.\n12:16: We've touched a little bit of what makes you come alive.\n12:18: But that feels like maybe it might not be something that is possible for today.\n12:24: So what is something that's possible for today in the energy state that you have that like, inspiration plus resting, what's something that you feel like you might want to do today to maybe touch another way of living that's meaningful?\n12:38: For you?\n12:41: Yeah, there.\n12:42: Oftentimes, when I'm in the States, the thing that I like the most is spending time in my head and just like, you know, allowing creativity and imagination to flow and explore.\n12:58: Because, you know, like, when I am in the office and I'm working or like when I'm building something, I'm focused and I.\n13:05: There's not much room for creativity.\n13:07: I find creativity comes mostly when I'm resting.\n13:12: So this is what I would like to not focus on, but come out, come up with.\n13:22: That makes a lot of sense.\n13:23: Like there's this yin yang thing, right?\n13:26: Like, you open that space for creativity on rest days, get the insights, come back on work days to focus and apply them, and then come back again.\n13:34: It has this kind of like, breathing pattern.\n13:37: What, what, what context can help support your creativity?\n13:40: I mean, we're having this conversation.\n13:42: Hopefully, like, I promise you, there's quotes and inspiration.\n13:45: Okay, so we'll get to that.\n13:48: Hopefully that'll be a part of the creativity inspiration moment.\n13:51: But what, what other things help you in days where you have, like, a little lower physical energy, a lot of inspirational energy, and you'd like to invite creativity?\n14:03: Yeah, there's a few things like journaling and like, there's alone time things like, yeah, journaling and even taking naps and things like that.\n14:16: But there's also the, like, talking with other people and group thinking, brainstorming.\n14:30: There's that too.\n14:31: Especially people who are going through the same stuff or have gone through similar stuff at least, or people who could give direction and ideas.\n14:43: Basically.\n14:43: Somebody like you.\n14:47: Yeah.\n14:48: So the.\n14:49: So yeah, those.\n14:50: A mix of the two, if that makes sense.\n14:53: Yeah.\n14:54: Is there.\n14:54: Okay, so we're doing a little bit of the talking, so it feels like maybe the thing that you need to make space for in your.\n15:01: The rest of your day.\n15:03: This is why I wanted to do it earlier in the day, which is good.\n15:06: Is the, the alone time and, and things like that.\n15:09: Is there something, you know, maybe we can, we can fit it into here.\n15:13: So you might have some other things like groceries.\n15:16: I don't know exactly.\n15:19: But maybe we can just look at the rest of the day.\n15:21: It's not that long.\n15:22: And think what would be a way of finding writing, taking naps.\n15:30: Yeah, yeah, actually, I, I have left my day to day without to dos.\n15:36: But there are some to dos.\n15:39: There are some decisions that I need to make, like invitations from others that I need to decide whether to accept or not.\n15:46: Like, for example, Mostafa wants to go to a bath, a Turkish bath.\n15:52: Or like massage and just like some of that stuff, cold bath and all these things, which sounds fun but also like it might take a few hours.\n16:10: So I don't know whether to do it or not.\n16:14: Yeah.\n16:15: And there's also things that are outside of what we were talking about, like calling my mom and because I haven't talked to her for a long time and connecting with some friends.\n16:26: But yeah, in terms of this in particular, I don't really have any explicit to dos.\n16:32: But I think after talking with you, I should add some to do's.\n16:35: Like for example, I should add journaling.\n16:38: I think at least that that sounds like a power move kind of to do.\n16:43: Cool.\n16:45: Yeah.\n16:46: Okay.\n16:47: Do you think there's a way of.\n16:49: Because, Because I can see.\n16:50: I don't know if you can see it.\n16:51: You feel like there's a connection potentially with this decision.\n16:54: So sometimes when decisions weigh, it takes space for creativity.\n16:57: So to make more room for creativity, you know, how, how can you think of this thing, decision, how are you going to prioritize your need for making space for creativity like your, your desire, ensure care for most of us and spending quality time.\n17:12: Is there a way that you can find that kind of addressing these needs or wants?\n17:20: Yeah, well, I mean one way is to like know it, but keep it short.\n17:29: But I know myself.\n17:30: Once I get there, I like get into it.\n17:33: It will be hard to cut it short.\n17:36: You know, all of a sudden it will be in there for four hours.\n17:44: Yeah, but I guess like I could set explicit expectations after.\n17:48: So I have to cut it short.\n17:50: Like deadlines.\n17:51: Like this call with you right now.\n17:54: It's in the calendar.\n17:55: We have to do it.\n18:00: Actually, would you mind if I take a quick two minute break to go to the bathroom?\n18:04: While you're there, think about other ways besides cutting it short that you can try to bring in both friend time and creativity time.\n18:12: Is that, is that really mutually exclusive?\n18:14: You pee and.\n18:17: Okay, sounds good.\n18:18: I'll be right back.\n18:22: It, it, it, it just in the bathroom.\n20:21: He'll be right back.\n20:33: I'm doing like kind of a coaching thing.\n20:39: I want to have privacy just in case you want to hear.\n20:51: Hey, Mar, I don't have evidence now.\n20:56: I can be much more present.\n20:59: Sometimes the PPs you need to pee.\n21:02: You go, go.\n21:03: Okay, we'll get back to our document.\n21:08: So here we were.\n21:09: Did you figure out way, like a creative way of finding space for both of these things that you value like time, quality time with your friends and creating creative creativity?\n21:25: Yeah, actually thinking about more.\n21:27: I think it would be nice.\n21:29: Even if it does run for four hours, we can just keep it, I think setting the intention during.\n21:36: For our time together when we're there to not just like, I mean, we could allow space for just like random conversations, but also kind of like how you explicitly set the intention for.\n21:50: For this call that we're doing this session together.\n21:54: And I think what, you know, the kind of conversations I want to have with them is the kind of thing that we could do in a hummam and it would be good.\n22:05: Yeah.\n22:06: So I'm going to like break character for just a second because I want to share an experience that I've had that was really beautiful that helped me connect with my creativity at the same time as spend quality time with a friend.\n22:21: And I don't know if I've ever done it with you, but it's just be together, but in silence.\n22:30: So cool.\n22:31: And.\n22:31: And I can imagine like being in the hammam and there's like the embodiment happening and trying to incorporate that into your open, imaginative space.\n22:39: Right.\n22:40: Like, what am I learning?\n22:41: You know, in the Muslim tradition it says that God revealed three books.\n22:46: The one that you can hold, that's made out of paper within you when you close your eyes and introspect and then the one outside you come into the horizon.\n22:57: And so I feel like the hammam can really open you up to two sources of revelation and insight.\n23:04: You know, oftentimes people even find emotions that they're in their body and emotions I can imagine can be leading to self understanding and creativity and all sorts of ways.\n23:15: So that's like, that's an aside.\n23:16: That's just a suggestion for a way to look at this in a.\n23:20: In a slightly different way that can help you do both things that you value.\n23:26: Quality time with friends and making space for that creativity.\n23:32: Yeah.\n23:33: Thank you for sharing that.\n23:34: That's beautiful.\n23:35: That's like a beat ad friend thing.\n23:36: Now we're gonna get back because.\n23:37: Yeah.\n23:39: In like the process, I shouldn't have given you advice or offer.\n23:42: Yeah, okay.\n23:47: Because.\n23:48: Yeah, because fundamentally it's best if and when it can come from you.\n23:51: And I really like your intention setting as well.\n23:54: And it could be an interesting, you know, like maybe a creative way forward is like set it together, share what you.\n24:02: What he's interested in and see if you can come up with an intention and like a commitment together for how you want to spend this course.\n24:10: Nice.\n24:11: Yeah, yeah, Very good.\n24:13: Thank you.\n24:14: All right.\n24:15: And I guess we've already did this with resolving Attacks, attention, love.\n24:22: Oh.\n24:23: Ah.\n24:23: But we did discover something that I think is really interesting, which is you mentioned something like.\n24:31: I don't know if I.\n24:32: I can't remember exactly if you said it like this, but you said something like, I haven't called my mom in a while and wondering, is that a have to do or a want to do?\n24:46: It's a mix of the two.\n24:50: Yeah.\n24:51: This is a really good question, actually.\n24:56: Yeah, it's the kind of thing where I feel like I want to do it for sure, but I just want to do it differently.\n25:11: The problem is because of the difference of the time zone difference.\n25:14: And usually, like, at the end of my day, I have.\n25:17: I don't enjoy talking to people at the end of the day.\n25:20: Like, if I'm calling her at 10:00pm or 9:00pm, I just, like, this is my rest time.\n25:25: I just want to be, you know, but.\n25:30: But it's the only time that's available.\n25:32: So it's becoming.\n25:34: The feeling of have to do is.\n25:35: Is.\n25:36: Is the one I'm sensing more than the feeling of want to do, you know, during the morning.\n25:41: I'm like, I can't wait to talk to her, like right now.\n25:44: I wish I could call her right now and I would be so happy.\n25:46: This would be a want to do for me right now, but by the time of the end of the day.\n25:50: And that's why, like, for the last so many days, I've been going to bed and feeling bad about it because I'm not calling her.\n25:58: Yeah, this is so interesting.\n26:01: Yeah, I don't like you feeling bad, Moshe.\n26:05: So it's so cool that it's obviously something that you would love to do.\n26:13: Right.\n26:14: And so getting to the point where this tension is resolved can be really beautiful because it goes from something where you feel bad about it to something where if with some, you know, reconfiguring or rethinking, it could be something really beautiful.\n26:30: So.\n26:30: So do you have any ideas about this one?\n26:33: So what could you do to help this become a want to do?\n26:38: And maybe this is going to be a hammam brainstorming session, but a couple of moments now to reflect on it.\n26:46: Yeah, actually, it's just like, you know, a lot of these realizations that I'm having are only coming up right now.\n26:55: Like, I didn't realize this before.\n26:56: I.\n26:57: I've just like, I've known that it's been a half to do, but I haven't been like, articulated as well as I just did it with you right now.\n27:05: So just through this articulation, I'm coming up with ways of resolving it.\n27:11: And one of them is like, there's also other thing that I've been wanting to do.\n27:16: So this makes it a double want to do, which is to wake up early.\n27:21: Lately I've been.\n27:24: Yeah, lately I've been falling behind on this.\n27:27: I've been like, this morning I woke up I think at nine.\n27:31: So yeah, and I like, I do wake up, but I just don't get out of bed.\n27:35: So I want to.\n27:36: So this makes it really exciting that like I wake up early, I call my mom and I achieve two wants to the, the want of getting out of bed and the want of calling my mom.\n27:48: And it's a beautiful time to share with her because this is my, the most precious time for me.\n27:55: The, the morning time.\n27:57: Can you share with the most precious people to you as well?\n28:03: Yeah.\n28:05: So this is actually very beautiful.\n28:07: If we just came out of this call with this.\n28:09: That's plenty.\n28:11: This is awesome.\n28:13: Okay, so this, this is so beautiful.\n28:16: This is kind of my, my whole thesis about this is like the to do list, right?\n28:23: There's some stuff on your to do list, like call your mom that you might have this tension around, right?\n28:28: And then some other stuff on your to do list, even, even going to the hammam with Mustafa.\n28:33: It's something you want to do, right?\n28:35: That you have some tension around.\n28:37: The call.\n28:37: Your mom thing felt like I should.\n28:39: It has a mix between a should and a want.\n28:42: And being very clear about these tensions is I think, a door into showing you who you want to be.\n28:49: And then with a little bit of reflection and self knowledge and creativity and being a mirror for each other, you can, you can kind of, you know, look at what is meaningful about that moment with most of our.\n29:01: What is meaningful about the creativity moment?\n29:03: What is meaningful about calling my mom?\n29:04: All the things that we put onto the to do lists that are trying to be like really wonderful things, things that we want in our lives, but they conflict because we're.\n29:13: We're not supposed so clear on what's meaningful and what's not.\n29:16: And sometimes there are all these conflicts that we can with some, some thinking kind of rearrange and the whole goal is to help someone's to do list be their developmental process.\n29:28: And it's, it's as simple as that.\n29:30: It's, you know, what they say is like, show me your to do list and I'll tell you who you are.\n29:35: That's one of the core ideas that were operational, operationalizing it's like.\n29:43: And it can help you become who you want to be.\n29:46: That's why it says the to become list.\n29:49: Yeah, exactly.\n29:50: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n29:52: Okay, cool.\n29:52: So this was really fun.\n29:53: I think you kind of understand the process and now we'll get to the.\n30:02: The inspirational quotes that are kind of guiding the process and I'll.\n30:09: We've already talked a lot about this, right?\n30:11: So it's about like, what are you doing?\n30:14: Your, your daily habits, the things that you do are defining you.\n30:18: Right?\n30:18: Show me your to do list.\n30:19: I'll tell you who you are.\n30:21: We already did that.\n30:22: Today is kind of a beautiful and interesting day of openness.\n30:25: There's a couple of to do's there, but mostly creating space for rest and creativity.\n30:30: So that's beautiful.\n30:34: This one, you remember this one.\n30:38: Don't ask what the world needs.\n30:40: Ask what makes you come alive, because the world needs people who have come alive.\n30:46: And that moment where you had that realization of like, wow, I can do two things I want to do that I love, you know, that are meaningful for me.\n30:55: I don't know if you felt the aliveness even in your tired body state, but I saw it.\n31:01: And I think that it's.\n31:04: That this, this is a really beautiful thing.\n31:06: But I wonder, do you think this is true?\n31:10: Yeah.\n31:11: For you, right?\n31:12: Yeah.\n31:13: But does the world actually need that?\n31:17: It's.\n31:18: Yeah.\n31:19: It makes me wonder about, like, how this connects with Ikigai and the idea of like bringing the three together, aligning the three things together of like, you know, the four.\n31:32: Actually.\n31:33: Yeah.\n31:37: Any other reflections?\n31:39: Like.\n31:42: Yeah, I.\n31:43: I have this.\n31:44: I read this.\n31:46: I can't paraphrase it.\n31:47: I mean, I can't quote it right now from, you know, Elizabeth Gilbert, the author.\n31:54: Yeah, exactly.\n31:55: Big Magic.\n31:55: She talks a little bit about this.\n31:57: How people should.\n32:00: Should write for themselves, not for the reader.\n32:04: And this, for some reason stuck with me.\n32:07: And I've been thinking a lot about it because I think I have the tendency to not do things for me.\n32:16: I do them for others and oftentimes this doesn't work so well.\n32:24: So I think this is something that I need to learn to be honest.\n32:27: Like, I like the reason I think stuck with me is because I think it's true, but I'm not doing it.\n32:37: And it's.\n32:37: I think it's not easy for me to.\n32:39: To live this one.\n32:42: It's the kind of thing that I have to be like, really reminding myself of every day and like being mindful of it.\n32:50: Yeah.\n32:52: For me, that usually happens when I am not entirely Convinced when?\n33:00: Because if this is true, then there's no better way to find your icky guy.\n33:05: Right.\n33:05: Like all the other things.\n33:06: Right.\n33:07: Like, if this is actually true and I really, really believed it, then I would be personally way more inclined to try to live in this way because, you know, it's, it would be a waste otherwise.\n33:18: It would be like distracted.\n33:21: So do you think that it might be that you don't truly believe it?\n33:25: Is that, could that be a part of the challenge?\n33:27: Or is it that you.\n33:29: How can you make it a stronger force with where you felt compelled by this idea to do something about it?\n33:38: Yeah, I think you're right.\n33:39: I, I do have doubts about it.\n33:41: It's not the kind of thing that I like, believe it with my whole body.\n33:50: Yeah.\n33:50: And I think this could be one of those things that, like, I don't know how much time we have to talk about this particular thing, but it's something that I could, I would, I think it would be valuable for me to talk more about whether right now or in other settings as well.\n34:05: Yeah.\n34:06: So actually some of the next quotes are continuation of this exploration.\n34:13: Another way to say it.\n34:14: Lao Tzu.\n34:15: If you want to awaken all of humanity, awaken yourself.\n34:18: If you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself.\n34:24: Truly the, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self transformation.\n34:31: God will not change a condition of a people until they change.\n34:35: That is what.\n34:36: That is what is within themselves.\n34:47: First to put the world in order, we must first put the nation in order.\n34:50: Order Confucius to put the nation in order, we must first put the family in order to put the family in order.\n34:56: First cultivate our personal life.\n34:59: We must first set our hearts right.\n35:04: Work is love made visible.\n35:06: And if you cannot work with love, but only with distaste, it's better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take donations from those who work.\n35:16: Work with joy.\n35:18: Okay, so that was some, you know, this idea of the truth is found when we can get kind of con.\n35:30: Confirmatory evidence from many different traditions.\n35:35: And so I, I, yeah, started like doing this exploration and, and it's, it's one of those things that we kind of have to take these people's words for it a little bit.\n35:47: Right.\n35:48: I think there's, there's two kinds of things.\n35:54: I think.\n35:55: One is quantitative, Right.\n35:57: We can say when we do a B testing and we get feedback, we can have some sort of like evolutionary process.\n36:07: We can even do tiny, random tweaks to see what works better.\n36:10: And, you know, like, that could be all quantitatively done with numbers.\n36:15: And you can, you know, move in, in that way.\n36:19: But then there's this sense of feeling something and then trusting equality and walking that path and then developing the evidence for it.\n36:34: So one of the processes that I am thinking to include in this coaching practice is validating this idea.\n36:45: It's experientially validating it by creating moments of perception of, like, beauty, meaning love, what makes you come alive, bringing more of that into your life and then seeing what are the things that you cared about.\n36:58: You know, let's say that you don't believe it so much.\n37:01: You think that sometimes you just have to do what you have to do, right?\n37:05: And it's annoying and you have to, like, whatever, just do it because it's what people want to be.\n37:13: Your marketing has to have cleavage because that's the only thing that's gonna pull eyeballs.\n37:17: And we'll use that and we'll leverage it for good somehow.\n37:20: You know, like, whatever it is, I don't really know what the actual decision are or the.\n37:25: I just have to call my mom.\n37:26: I'm just gonna put it on my calendar every day, 10pm Even if I don't feel like it, I'm just gonna call and I'm just gonna do it because that's what I should do.\n37:33: That's what I want to do, I think, right?\n37:35: Versus, like this kind of transformation and the coming to life and developing that.\n37:39: Wait a second.\n37:40: Like this?\n37:40: Actually, we'll see.\n37:43: I don't know, actually.\n37:44: So the idea is to make it an experiment for the person so that they will be the next person on the quote list.\n37:51: I don't know how you will say it in your life or even if you will say it, but the idea is, you know, it's clear that there's something here.\n38:00: And with some togetherness and coaching, you and I, or me and whomever, or you and an LLM, then maybe we can try to make this really true.\n38:15: So if there's ever a day where you're like, well, I.\n38:18: I really don't want to do that, but I just.\n38:19: I have to do it anyway.\n38:21: You think, why am I doing this to myself?\n38:24: Why am I doing this to the world?\n38:25: You know, it's actually the wrong thing to do something like that.\n38:31: So this.\n38:32: Yeah, that's the goal.\n38:35: But I don't know if you have any thoughts, like, after seeing all these quotes and reflecting on it a Little with me.\n38:42: Yeah, I think that maybe like right now the thing that's coming up to me the most is I think the hardest challenge with, with embodying this way of thinking is when I, when I don't, when I'm not convinced with something that I should do, but I know that I'm not convinced with it.\n39:09: Not necessarily because it's wrong or like it doesn't work, but it's because I don't have enough information.\n39:16: For example, say that like I am working on building this feature in the app that I am not really convinced with, but people are asking for it and I don't necessarily think this is what we should be giving them.\n39:30: Maybe there's something else, but like there's so many voices that are saying this is what we should do.\n39:37: And like, okay, well so many people are saying it, let's just do it.\n39:40: But I'm not really convinced, you know, so how, how to like.\n39:44: And I think this is where like maybe an element of trust comes in.\n39:47: Like I trust those guys are saying what they're saying is, is what we need to do, but I don't really, I guess I'm saying I trust it, but I don't really trust it because I still, I'm fighting it.\n39:58: Yeah, there's definitely going to have, have to be some self awareness and presence and feeling that initially, you know, is not for you, but it could be for somebody else.\n40:13: Like for me for instance, if the idea doesn't come from me, I might reject it naturally to protect my own ego.\n40:20: Right.\n40:20: That kind of thing.\n40:21: That could be the negative impression.\n40:23: So this feeling of coming to life or like using, using your heart to guide your actions requires you to know when something is either coming from you.\n40:34: And you might say that's like the self, the ego, the self protection, even financial protection.\n40:39: Or like, I need this.\n40:41: Or you know, I'm sure a lot of people that steal things say I need it more than they do.\n40:45: Like, life is hard.\n40:46: I won't be, I won't be able to find a job.\n40:49: I have to, you know, there's a lot of have to's, need to's that are self justifications and to be able to catch those and to know those can really help you in determining, I think whether this is an authentic like heartfelt.\n41:05: No, that is like aligned with maybe something that you're not quite able to put into words yet or if it's just a rejection because of habit or because of some of these other more self oriented, you know, orientations.\n41:26: And the.\n41:28: That distinguishing requires presence.\n41:30: So another element, along with kind of testing this idea of, like, can I actually follow my heart?\n41:36: Is.\n41:37: Can I actually hear my heart, which requires presence and attention.\n41:42: Yeah.\n41:43: And yeah.\n41:46: Yeah.\n41:46: There's this quote that I also really like.\n41:49: I forget how it goes exactly, but I'm gonna try to remember it.\n41:57: I've quoted it so many times, I can't believe that I can't quote it right now.\n42:00: But essentially it's something to.\n42:02: The effect of freedom comes with wisdom.\n42:09: And it's like the more you know yourself, the more free you are.\n42:13: Yeah.\n42:15: So it's kind of this one is there.\n42:19: It's.\n42:20: It's similar to this.\n42:21: Yeah, yeah, it's similar to this.\n42:23: But it's actually.\n42:24: It comes from the Muslim tradition from some.\n42:28: I can't remember.\n42:29: It's like Ibn Arabi or some.\n42:31: I can actually pull it up quickly, but I can do that at the end.\n42:36: Yeah.\n42:36: But this idea of, like, freedom is, I think, really beautiful.\n42:40: Like, freedom and not grasping.\n42:44: Right.\n42:45: Like, how do you see things for what they are?\n42:48: And part of that is seeing, like, what your embodied state is.\n42:52: Your heart is telling you or so on, and being able to distinguish between, like, lack of information.\n42:57: Is it because this confusion about whether or not you trust this information, information or not probably just needs more insight.\n43:05: Right.\n43:06: Why I not trust it?\n43:08: Is it because the.\n43:10: I don't trust their intentions for the product and they might want something that will, like, lead us to building something for them that is not our intentions for the product?\n43:17: Like that kind of like tug of war, you know?\n43:21: Or is there something.\n43:22: Something else behind that?\n43:24: Is it yourself?\n43:25: Is it?\n43:27: Yeah, so that's.\n43:27: That's like an exploratory process.\n43:31: And.\n43:32: And then this is.\n43:33: Is kind of another part of the inspiration behind the framing and the framework that we're looking into.\n43:40: And it's.\n43:41: It's another one of these.\n43:42: Basically, yesterday I was clever, so I want to change the world.\n43:47: Today, I am wise and I'm changing myself.\n43:51: And before we.\n43:52: We ask the.\n43:53: Answer the question here about, you know, who do you think is wise?\n43:59: Yeah.\n43:59: What.\n43:59: What do you think the.\n44:00: The difference is between being clever and wise?\n44:09: That's an interesting question.\n44:14: So wisdom, I, for me, is connected with experience and intuition and.\n44:29: Yeah.\n44:31: And I think being clever.\n44:35: So, Yeah, I guess wisdom to me is also connected to the action.\n44:40: But cleverness is connected with more.\n44:43: More with thoughts.\n44:45: That makes sense.\n44:46: Yeah, yeah.\n44:49: Interesting.\n44:50: Beautiful.\n44:50: Yeah.\n44:51: It connects with experience, intuition, action.\n44:54: Clever is connected to thoughts.\n44:57: Yeah.\n44:59: Yeah.\n45:00: It's interesting yeah, because.\n45:02: Because I think, you know, like wisdom to me is connected with skillfulness.\n45:08: But clever.\n45:08: Not necessarily.\n45:09: Like you can like say the clever thing.\n45:12: I guess you could also potentially do the clever thing.\n45:15: But I would call that more of a wise action.\n45:21: That's just the way I think of it, I guess.\n45:23: Yeah.\n45:25: You can see that Rumi actually kind of implies that here where he says, I wanted to change the world.\n45:32: No action, right.\n45:33: No doing.\n45:34: And then changing myself is an action that's happening now.\n45:38: Right.\n45:40: See the difference already over here.\n45:43: So once things move from like the theory and the ideas into action, like for me, I've been theorizing this thing for like weeks, but maybe I'm becoming slightly bit more wise, but being like.\n45:55: And like go through the process with people and see if it's helpful in any way.\n46:00: Okay.\n46:02: Yeah.\n46:02: And so, so now like, I guess this is like a role model question.\n46:07: Who do you think is wise or who lives a life that you think is full of meaning and wisdom?\n46:17: Yeah, well, I mean like somebody who's living right now, who's alive, or is.\n46:22: It like just somebody that you have enough information about, like maybe you can explain like why you think that or maybe how it shows up in their day to day.\n46:32: So if you, if you've read Biography, for instance, like that.\n46:35: That could be a good source.\n46:44: Yeah, I would say.\n46:49: Or I mean, just from reading a little bit about him.\n46:57: Sounds like a very wise person, especially in the way he.\n47:04: He questions things and the way he.\n47:09: Yeah, the way he understands the world and.\n47:16: But.\n47:16: But I.\n47:17: I can't.\n47:17: Yeah.\n47:17: So he's.\n47:19: Yeah.\n47:19: I mean, from my, from what I've read about him, I've found a lot of ideas that I'm trying to bring into my life.\n47:31: Like what.\n47:35: One idea is about.\n47:37: I mean, the one that's.\n47:39: Let's see.\n47:40: So one of them is the idea of seeing, not not seeing.\n47:45: So I'm having a hard time articulating this.\n47:47: But basically the story goes like this, where he sends Rumi to a bar and then he tells him, you know that story probably.\n47:56: Yeah.\n47:57: Yeah.\n47:58: So.\n47:59: So this idea of like he.\n48:00: And the quote goes something like this.\n48:02: It's like a true believer can be in a bar and like.\n48:11: I can't remember how to say it exactly, but some like.\n48:14: I know it's in my mind, but I can't say it into words.\n48:19: But like they turn any place they are into a place of worship.\n48:23: So like they could be in a bar and they.\n48:24: That's their place of worship.\n48:26: But Something like that.\n48:28: Yeah.\n48:34: Even if it's like, you know, like, it's a haram thing.\n48:38: So I guess this idea of this is.\n48:41: This doesn't have the, like.\n48:43: Yeah, exactly.\n48:44: But it has that one.\n48:45: The basic idea.\n48:50: Okay.\n48:51: Yeah, we did it in this one.\n48:54: We did it in the template.\n48:56: Okay.\n48:56: Yeah.\n48:56: So, yeah, I mean, he says it so much more beautifully.\n48:59: Or that's translation of it.\n49:02: Yeah.\n49:02: You can study God through everything and everyone in the universe because God is not confined in a mosque, synagogue, or church.\n49:08: But if you are still in need of knowing exactly where his abode is, there is only one place to look for him and the heart of a true lover.\n49:18: Beautiful.\n49:20: Okay.\n49:22: And this.\n49:23: This really connects a lot with the.\n49:25: And I guess he embodies that.\n49:27: Yeah, sorry, go ahead.\n49:29: He embodies that how?\n49:30: No, you go ahead.\n49:31: No, you go ahead.\n49:32: No, and, like, in the way he spends time with.\n49:37: At least in the stories I was reading about him, like, with people from all different backgrounds, like.\n49:43: Like a prostitute or a beggar or like the son of, you know, like, Rumi or all different kinds of people.\n49:57: What about that you think is.\n49:59: Is beautiful?\n50:03: Like, what.\n50:03: What about it is meaningful or interesting?\n50:06: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n50:10: I think that the beauty in it is.\n50:12: Is, like.\n50:16: It's like he.\n50:17: He can see through the layers of people and, like, he looks straight, like, the ability to connect.\n50:27: And I think that the beauty in this is that, you know, this idea that I really like, and it's something that I care deeply about, is the idea of we are all one.\n50:38: And to me, I see that he's able to embody this and love this by connecting with the hearts of people, which makes us all one.\n50:49: And like, the.\n50:50: To the togetherness or.\n50:51: Or the.\n50:52: The oneness of our hearts.\n51:00: So through these, like, ties of relationships and not putting up any blocks to anyone, even.\n51:07: Even, you know, prostitutes or drunkards, oneness is more possible.\n51:12: Oneness is happening.\n51:13: You know, he's.\n51:14: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n51:18: Okay.\n51:18: Beautiful.\n51:20: Do you see anything connecting, like, between this and the first story you told me about your users?\n51:38: Yeah, I do.\n51:40: Because, like, through the connections we were having with them.\n51:43: With them.\n51:45: And like, the.\n51:46: The meetings and the interviews.\n51:47: Interviews, definitely.\n51:54: Yeah.\n51:55: You were going from cleverness to wisdom, I think.\n52:01: Yeah, yeah, that's.\n52:03: Yeah, exactly.\n52:07: So I think what's really beautiful and interesting about what we're coming to hear is being very.\n52:14: Not very yet, but more articulate about why you love Sham Tabriz.\n52:19: Why did that meeting thing that you did with users, like, matter to you so much?\n52:24: It's like it.\n52:25: It's kind of unifying the business and the customers, right?\n52:29: It's.\n52:29: It's the process of unification.\n52:30: Like this, this bringing together seems to be something that's really valuable for you, and it shows up in what you love about Shams and what you love about, like, a recent meaningful moment.\n52:41: And, and so the question, if we were going to, like, do this next week or have another session or once, if you start doing the prompt would be to kind of really understand how to formalize this value in a way that feels like, yeah, that's it.\n52:54: You know, it's oneness or deep relationships where boundaries dissolve, pathways open into the future or whatever it is.\n53:02: You know, like kind of clarifying exactly what about it lights you up and then thinking, how can I bring that more into tomorrow or the day after?\n53:11: Can I bring that into the thing with my mom?\n53:18: And just to try to make you, help you find more ways of coming alive by looking into the stories of people that you admire.\n53:28: And you know what?\n53:29: Let's.\n53:29: Let's get another story now if we can.\n53:32: Like, is there a moment in your life where you felt, like, really alive?\n53:37: You know, this is.\n53:39: This is like the process of the onboarding.\n53:41: Like, it's to gather these stories and to try to get you to share and to point, like, what about it really was the most meaningful thing, you know, you have just shared with me the quote from Sham Seneca could have been, like, great, but, like, we need to get a little bit more specific here.\n53:56: So we're going to get a couple of stories and it's likely that we'll find hopefully more than one value because, you know, we.\n54:04: We are.\n54:04: We contain multitudes.\n54:06: What's the story in your history of, like, a really meaningful moment?\n54:14: Yeah, the.\n54:16: Whenever this question comes up, one of the first ones that just immediately pops into my head is back in 2011, 2012, when I came.\n54:30: But maybe it's like, I don't know if this is because it's kind of like ancient history at this point.\n54:36: Maybe it's just me romanticizing it, especially every time I repeat it in my head.\n54:41: But I'm just going to give it as it is or as I remember it.\n54:44: Remember, try to get into your headspace or your body space and like, see.\n54:51: See if you can make it less of a story and more of a retelling, if that makes sense.\n54:55: You know, what was it like?\n54:57: Where were you?\n54:58: Were you seeing?\n54:59: How did you feel?\n55:00: You know, don't just tell the story.\n55:02: Like, maybe kind of first Personize it.\n55:05: I'm not sure if that helps you feel it more, but like, I'm trying to see if we can connect to it a little bit more deeply rather than like, this is a canned response that I give anytime someone asks.\n55:15: Yeah, good point.\n55:19: Yeah.\n55:20: Well, I'm going to try this one.\n55:22: So.\n55:23: So one, it's.\n55:24: There's two stories actually now.\n55:26: The other one popped up, which is also a popular one from back when I was living.\n55:33: So this one is actually a little predates.\n55:35: It's a little like 20.\n55:37: 20, 2010 or 2011.\n55:40: When I was living in the US in Minnesota, I was with Marie.\n55:47: I had.\n55:47: So the day before it, I had just read an article, a news article that she.\n55:54: That was telling a story of a prostitute in.\n56:00: In Iraqi prostitute who had gone to Syria.\n56:05: And basically it was like an interview with her.\n56:09: And as I was reading the story, I was getting angry.\n56:12: I was, I was angry at her because I felt like she was greedy and this.\n56:17: And she's using her body to make money.\n56:20: And oh, the story was that her husband died, I think, and she was doing this work so that she can earn money for her family.\n56:29: I was like.\n56:30: And I had grown up to like, it would.\n56:34: It would be better if she was taking money like as a beggar from other people than to go and be a prostitute.\n56:41: So I, I was like, she's lying.\n56:44: She's trying to get people's sympathy when what she's one, you know, like, she's just trying to get more money because.\n56:53: Sure.\n56:53: Like, even if that's really her way of making money, then, like, just go to a few clients, make enough money to survive and then like, stop it.\n57:00: You don't need to keep doing it.\n57:01: So anyway, I was making all these judgments and then I thought everybody agreed.\n57:09: So I went and talked to Marie about this and I shared just like I was expecting an immediate agreement.\n57:15: But then as she listened to me and then she started asking me questions about why I was feeling this way, this way.\n57:25: And I started questioning it.\n57:29: And I was getting even more angry at that point that, why are you questioning this like this?\n57:37: It should.\n57:37: This.\n57:38: Of course, this is how it is.\n57:39: So I was actually resisting the questioning of this.\n57:44: But because it's Maria, like, there's this dynamic between us, I couldn't show that anger.\n57:49: So I was going along with it.\n57:51: But then by the end, I realized that, wait a second.\n57:55: I think she's right.\n57:56: I think I should be questioning this and I should understand it better.\n57:59: And then I was actually able to empathize with this person, and it was able to dismantle all these judgments.\n58:09: So this is a memory of like, I don't know, it's like it feels like the first time, or the first time I remember at least of changing a belief and like.\n58:23: Yeah.\n58:24: Seeing my biases so close and my judgments.\n58:29: What was it about that.\n58:32: That you feel is.\n58:34: Is actually the meaningful part?\n58:38: Yeah.\n58:38: How we went from being so sure about something to realizing I was the fool, not that other person I was judging.\n58:49: It was.\n58:50: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n58:53: And.\n58:54: Yeah.\n58:55: What does that realization afford or what.\n58:58: What does it do?\n59:04: I guess it's a reminder of, like, how, you know, like this.\n59:11: This idea of, like, we know this much about the other people we meet.\n59:15: There's so little that we know, and we.\n59:18: We jump quickly to judgments.\n59:21: And I keep repeating this so many times.\n59:23: Like, so many times I judge people and I realize it was.\n59:31: It was just a judgment.\n59:32: It wasn't.\n59:35: And what would be possible if you weren't the kind of person that.\n59:39: That makes these judgments?\n59:40: What new way of being is possible?\n59:46: Oh, it's just like it opens.\n59:50: Yeah, I.\n59:52: I think it opens up the possibility for so much better connectedness.\n59:59: So many more relationships that are deep and meaningful.\n60:08: Yeah.\n60:09: I mean, there.\n60:12: Yeah, I'm sure there are so many relationships that I'm missing out on because.\n60:17: Because it's my inability to see people for who they are and like, connect with them like Shamsa Breeze, rather than putting my judgment on them.\n60:30: And what's blocked then?\n60:32: Like, relationships are great, but is that the end or is there something that's being blocked by not being able to form these relationships?\n60:47: Can you actually elaborate this one a bit more?\n60:49: Yeah.\n60:50: Like, is the relationship.\n60:53: Relationship the end of the meaning question?\n60:58: Like, we can't ask anything else about it, or is it that these relationships we have opportunities for friend.\n61:07: I don't know.\n61:07: Like, I don't know.\n61:08: Like what.\n61:08: What is being blocked by not being able to form these relationships?\n61:15: Yeah, I think.\n61:16: Honestly, yeah, I think the.\n61:17: The relationship.\n61:18: Well, I mean, there are things that come out of the relationships, but I.\n61:24: For me, the relationship is the end.\n61:28: So the relationship is not something to enable something else.\n61:31: There are things that come out of it, you know, like, for example, let's say you pray not so that you get the peace in your heart.\n61:38: You pray to.\n61:39: Pray to be close to God, but.\n61:41: Or like, you will have this connection with God for the sake of the connection, not so that you can.\n61:46: Yeah, yeah.\n61:47: It's called instrumental.\n61:49: And we'll get to that later once I talk about the framework.\n61:51: So it's.\n61:52: It's not instrumental.\n61:53: Okay.\n61:53: It's an end in and of itself.\n61:55: Otherwise known.\n61:56: Like, we can.\n61:57: Like the language and literature is constitutive.\n62:03: Okay.\n62:06: Yeah.\n62:07: Do you have any recollections of discussions.\n62:12: Oh, maybe the story that you just told me about the anger, but, like, unconscious loops, like, do you have things where you were operating in a certain way, and then one day you're like, oh, shoot, that's.\n62:24: That's why I do that.\n62:26: I finally figured this out.\n62:29: I think I have the perfect one.\n62:31: And I'll give it to you right after the break.\n62:36: I'm a small bladder.\n62:41: Relieve thyself this morning, but I think the answer to your question.\n62:49: I'll be back.\n62:50: I'll see you in a bit.\n63:04: It.\n63:46: All right.\n63:50: Okay.\n63:51: Yeah.\n63:52: Sorry, I can't.\n63:53: Yeah.\n63:54: Unconscious, sir.\n63:55: So I don't know if this is actually what you're asking, so feel free to interrupt me if I'm not, like, if I'm answering a different question.\n64:06: Yeah.\n64:13: Yeah.\n64:14: So.\n64:21: So situations that, like, I take things personally, I guess, and.\n64:30: Yeah, so.\n64:30: So, yeah.\n64:32: And my ego steps in.\n64:33: So these are kind of like the analysis of it.\n64:36: But let me get back to the story.\n64:37: The story simply is this comes from yesterday.\n64:41: As one.\n64:41: One of the instances of this is yesterday.\n64:44: We were at the venue of the event, and I was asking one of the people who are doing the logistics to organize the tables and chairs in a different way than they were laid out in.\n65:03: And he was not receiving it well.\n65:06: He was getting angry, and he was, like, starting to fight it.\n65:12: That's how it seemed to me in the moment.\n65:15: Like, why are you fighting?\n65:16: I'm just asking you to.\n65:17: And this is your job.\n65:18: Your job is to lay out the table.\n65:19: Tables and chairs.\n65:20: And the way you're doing it right now is.\n65:24: Is using too much space.\n65:25: We need to make it tighter so we can fit more.\n65:30: But he was fighting, and he was, like, getting angry.\n65:33: He was, like, throwing the chairs and so on, and I wasn't dealing with it well.\n65:37: I was also fighting.\n65:38: And at that point, like, what are you doing?\n65:41: And, you know, like, I was starting to fight him, but.\n65:45: And I was, you know, like, noticing myself, and, like, my heart was pounding and.\n65:50: And I was shivering.\n65:51: And this is my reaction often when I'm in that state.\n65:57: And.\n65:58: Yeah, so I was getting into it, and I was noticing that I'm getting into it, but I don't know how to stop myself.\n66:03: Like, I want to fix the situation, but every word that comes out of me is making it worse.\n66:12: Yeah.\n66:12: So that's.\n66:13: That's what happened at the time.\n66:15: And then until most of us stepped in and he.\n66:17: Beautifully and with kindness, he dissolved the whole issue.\n66:21: He was like, let's just pause everything.\n66:24: Let's get water.\n66:25: He got everybody a bottle of water.\n66:27: Drink your water.\n66:28: After you drink, we will talk again.\n66:29: And then everybody had their water, and then we started talking about.\n66:33: It was like, okay, so what.\n66:34: What do we have right now?\n66:35: What is possible?\n66:36: What can we do?\n66:37: And then very beautifully, he.\n66:40: He solved the pro.\n66:41: The whole problem.\n66:44: Yeah.\n66:46: So it sounds like this isn't.\n66:47: This is exactly a.\n66:50: A pattern, a loop that.\n66:51: That happens.\n66:52: You say that this is, you know, not the first time and that you.\n66:55: You can even notice the physiological changes.\n66:58: You're like, oh, there it is again.\n66:59: But I just can't stop myself.\n67:02: I'm not sure this one fits this, because we have a.\n67:05: I don't feel like potentially it's uncovered yet, but maybe we can.\n67:09: We can look into it a little bit.\n67:11: What do you think is going on for you?\n67:12: Like, maybe you have, like, another example in your mind that you can contrast it with and find similarities.\n67:17: Like what?\n67:19: You know, let's try this one.\n67:22: Yeah.\n67:24: What.\n67:25: So we're going to always be coming back to meaning.\n67:27: And, like, what way of being was being blocked?\n67:31: Blocked by the person's behavior?\n67:33: Like, what thing that you value do you think was getting blocked or overrun somehow?\n67:41: Yeah.\n67:42: So this is the part that I think I uncovered recently is the ego, the element of ego in it.\n67:52: And this is thanks to Mia, because I was talking to her about this today and trying to.\n67:56: Because she was there and saw the whole thing.\n67:59: So I was trying to understand it better with her, and she was saying, maybe you're taking this personally.\n68:03: And this is the part that is uncovered for me.\n68:05: I didn't.\n68:06: I didn't realize that I was taking it personally.\n68:08: And I thought it was just about the situation.\n68:11: This guy was irritating me.\n68:13: But it's not that.\n68:14: It's because.\n68:15: Or this is what I'm realizing is that it's because I was taking it as, like, he's not listening to my authority, and he's, you know, and like, it was a personal issue for me rather than about the situation.\n68:34: And then when I had the situation, I was like, oh, there's all these other instances where this was happening, and this was possibly the root cause as well.\n68:51: Yeah.\n68:51: And this is something that I'm still discovering.\n68:54: I still, like, haven't I can't say with full confidence that's how it is.\n68:59: But I feel like we're.\n69:01: I'm on to something or Min has helped me get onto something with this idea of, you know, this is a.\n69:10: An ego issue.\n69:11: And, like, it's.\n69:12: I'm taking it personal.\n69:13: It's like my authority, like, he's.\n69:15: He's violating my authority or respect or whatever.\n69:19: Yeah.\n69:19: And what about, like, authority and respect is actually something not.\n69:24: You know, people often use these words like ego, authority, respect, to say, like, I shouldn't have these things and I should try to subdue them so that I can be more nice to these people.\n69:35: But what is actually meaningful that is behind them or is it not?\n69:41: Is it just something that you're getting in your own way, people?\n69:45: Yeah, I don't know what to do, honestly.\n69:48: Like, I don't know how to deal with it as well.\n69:50: Like, I don't know if I should subdue them and, like, I should, like, you know, not have an ego or if there's a different way to handle this kind of situation.\n70:01: But the thing that I realizing is that, you know, like, it's like I have a sensitive spot there and this is a trigger for me.\n70:09: Yeah.\n70:11: Because I think somebody else in that situation, like, for example, Mortala, I don't think he would have been triggered the same way I was.\n70:19: I.\n70:19: I have a.\n70:21: So in terms of the framework, this.\n70:23: This is where we can actually, like, be mirrors for each other.\n70:26: So this is not be that.\n70:28: This is still.\n70:29: I'm in the coaching process, just so you know how it actually looks.\n70:32: But one of the things I noticed that I thought was interesting and maybe.\n70:36: Maybe I'm projecting from my side.\n70:39: But you said interesting.\n70:41: Where is it?\n70:42: I took the notes.\n70:45: You said, this is your job.\n70:48: Okay.\n70:49: So there's that element of authority, but there's also this element of, like, pay, money, what is a job, who does what.\n70:58: That's kind of related to that somehow how societies, like, are organized and this, like, maybe subconscious belief of money makes rights, maybe something like that.\n71:12: There's.\n71:12: I feel like there's something about, like, this is your job.\n71:15: That was.\n71:15: That stood out to me.\n71:16: Does it stand out to you at all or what?\n71:19: Can you reflect on that?\n71:22: That's a very good point.\n71:23: Yeah.\n71:24: Especially as you're saying.\n71:25: It's.\n71:25: It is like, it immediately connected with a recollection I have of this moment.\n71:34: Yeah.\n71:35: I was.\n71:35: I was feeling like there was kind of this power dynamic because.\n71:41: Because you received this money, you're obligated.\n71:43: To do the things the way I tell you to do them kind of thing.\n71:48: And when you're not doing it and you're resisting, you're like, you're starting to be unfair and, you know, getting into all this.\n71:59: Actually, no, let me take back this fairness issue.\n72:02: But it's more like that.\n72:03: It's not unfair, but, like, you're.\n72:09: It's like you're using me.\n72:11: And I think this is also a pattern in Iraq that's, you know, this happens so many times that everybody's trying to fight for their right, you know.\n72:27: Yeah, yeah.\n72:29: I guess entitlement, I'm trying to get.\n72:31: This is the word that I'm trying to.\n72:32: It's.\n72:33: I was feeling entitled to.\n72:39: To get this job done by you, but you're not doing it kind of thing.\n72:44: Yeah.\n72:46: There sounded like some.\n72:48: Some scarcity mindset that you see in society, but I don't know if you see yourself within it or not.\n72:53: So everyone's trying to fight for their rights, but, like, are you or are you not in this case also one of those people?\n73:02: Yeah, I would say I am, yeah.\n73:08: If you had infinite money.\n73:10: Infinite, like, you just, like, super rich, and this person was not doing their job that you paid them to do, would you still feel irritated?\n73:25: I think so.\n73:31: It is a bit of a.\n73:33: I don't know.\n73:33: I mean, I don't know what kind of mindset I would be in if I had infinite money.\n73:39: Yeah.\n73:39: But it wasn't really about the money or the value of the money.\n73:44: It was more about, like, the deal we had, kind of.\n73:48: I guess.\n73:50: Yeah.\n73:51: Sounds like there's a lot of nice juicy things here to reflect on this idea of entitlement, this idea of, like, this is your job.\n73:59: Right.\n73:59: I think, like, I would kind of explore that idea of where did I get that idea that just because I paid somebody, they have to do things my way?\n74:09: Like, what is capitalism?\n74:10: What are we living in?\n74:11: What is needs?\n74:11: What is society like?\n74:12: There's a lot of things all tied up in here, and I'm gonna move forward because we're actually getting a little low on time.\n74:21: But this is a really cool pattern that could be really interesting to play with because actually it'll take us to this quote.\n74:30: Where is it?\n74:31: Here we go.\n74:31: This one.\n74:32: Why feel everything?\n74:34: Do you know the guest house poem?\n74:36: Yeah, yeah.\n74:38: And then from here, what I think I'll do is let's.\n74:43: Let's see what I'll do, but let's.\n74:45: I'll read the guest house poem by the Student of your.\n74:50: Or the partner or the collaborator of your.\n74:53: Your wise guy.\n74:56: This human being is a guest house every morning a new arrival, a joy, a depression, a meanness.\n75:06: Some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.\n75:11: Welcome and entertain them all, even if they're a crowd of sorrows who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture.\n75:19: Still, treat each guest honorably.\n75:23: They may be clearing you out for some new delight.\n75:26: The dark thought, the shame, the malice.\n75:30: Meet them at the door, laughing, and invite them in.\n75:33: Be grateful for whatever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.\n75:41: And this poem, you know, we talked about the three.\n75:46: The three revelations, the world, the paper book, and then the insight.\n75:52: I think this poem really shows us one of the ways of thinking about how that revelation inside of us happens and what form it takes.\n76:07: Yeah.\n76:13: What do you.\n76:14: Okay.\n76:15: Yeah.\n76:16: You okay?\n76:16: Go for it.\n76:18: I was just gonna say quickly.\n76:20: I've read this poem so many times, and I've read it for others, and this time one thing jumped out at me is the idea of meet them at the door laughing.\n76:30: And for some reason, this is.\n76:31: I was thinking, like, how can you laugh when there's these different emotions?\n76:37: Like the different.\n76:38: Each of them bring out different kind of action or reaction.\n76:45: How.\n76:45: How to just laugh when they're all like, love this at the same to all of them.\n76:51: But I was really thinking, maybe it's not the same laugh.\n76:54: Maybe it's a different laugh.\n76:55: Like, yeah, maybe like one laugh of like, laughing for happiness.\n77:04: And like, sometimes you laugh because it's like there's nothing you can do.\n77:08: Like, well, whatever, I'm just gonna laugh about it.\n77:10: But it's not like laughing because I'm happy.\n77:15: So this.\n77:15: I don't know, this just came up as we were reading it, very keen.\n77:20: And I think it's also connected with some of your other.\n77:23: Actually there's like, this whole thread about a struggle to oneness throughout this whole conversation.\n77:32: The struggle to seeing your oneness in this guy that's irritating you, who's not doing things that you want.\n77:37: Right?\n77:38: And then the struggle to, like, understand, like, who's laughing in this poem because you've identified with one of the.\n77:51: The emotions that are coming, but not with the witnesser, not with the oneness that's watching these things.\n77:56: Right?\n77:57: And so I think there's this, like, exploration around oneness, because when I.\n78:02: When I see that, like, greet them at the door laughing, I think of the emotions as not me.\n78:09: And I am some.\n78:11: The thing that can see them and be like, welcome you know, and this actually gets to kind of the core of the framework that I'm adapting from some.\n78:22: Some other work that talks about, you know, this idea of our values and, like, the things that we want.\n78:31: But I've been adapting it with my understanding of not exactly wanting, but being called by oneness, essentially, that there's a way of thinking about our sense of meaning as being a sense of something kind of we recognize and that it's, you know, we can say that it's like, why are all these messages being sent from beyond?\n79:06: Right?\n79:07: Like, what.\n79:07: What are we to do with them?\n79:10: And I think, you know, this is the framework that I'm trying to build, is philosophical, sound and structured and can be used as a coaching method and spiritually aligned, partially because I believe that this is.\n79:26: This stuff is true and that it's better to, you know, reshape the coaching methods to fit the.\n79:32: The spiritual perspective than to shape the spiritual perspective to fit the coaching methods.\n79:38: And, and yeah, this, this is the whole.\n79:41: The whole idea is to create spaces of presence which might require whatever it takes for us to let those things that can be confusing us or blocking our attentions from, like, our emotions.\n79:58: You talk about freedom, right?\n79:59: That comes.\n80:01: We talked about some of the different blocks where we don't even want to look at the phone at 10 o'clock because we know there's like all these, like, knotted things and like, I'm not these things a little bit more and more and actually see the tensions as signs, like this tension over here in the.\n80:19: In that story of a pattern, or the tension with your mom, or even the tension between two things that matter to you with Mustafa and your creativity day.\n80:28: And to think, like, what is the most beautiful way to answer the questions that God is giving me today?\n80:37: Right?\n80:38: To actually pursue what is the most beautiful, meaningful way to act and not to kind of kuffer my eyes and I'm gonna maybe go through.\n80:55: Yeah, this is.\n80:56: This is a part of the things.\n80:58: It's like looking at your patterns that get in your way and then trying to get to the point where you can really understand.\n81:04: And so a lot of this, like, reflection and comprehension, you might think of it as like a waste of time, but I really believe, you know, this idea of he who has a strong enough why can overcome any how.\n81:15: And also what Tony Robbins is saying over here is that often, like, people will spend years struggling with something, but then it might hurt, it might be annoying, it might take some time to, like, really look at your quote unquote.\n81:26: Arrogance or your ego or whatever it is in there.\n81:29: But once you get a real deep clarity about it, the change is going to be small because the real work is in the self understanding.\n81:37: And I think this kind of connects back with that whole, like, if you want to change the world, change yourself and all that other stuff.\n81:43: This is the demo check in.\n81:46: Let me make sure I didn't miss anything else that was important.\n81:48: Why feel everything?\n81:49: Everything.\n81:50: Oh, yeah, this one, which is here.\n81:54: Right.\n81:54: So some of these ideas are looping around over here where it could be a pattern in your thoughts, like I deserve that.\n82:03: You might not even be clear about like what these thought patterns are.\n82:06: Right.\n82:08: That become words, that become actions that, you know, create your character and your destiny.\n82:13: But also we can, we can reflect on like what things inspire us, make our hearts glow, what ways of being, you know, when you saw Muslima do that, you're probably pretty inspired.\n82:23: I don't know.\n82:23: But like I, when I saw that, I was like, you thought about water.\n82:27: Like that's so aware, you know, it's so cool.\n82:31: And then you could think, okay, well what was Mostafa attending to in that moment?\n82:35: What did he notice?\n82:37: How was he holding it?\n82:38: Like, what kind of ways of being are possible for him that I would like to take on?\n82:42: Right.\n82:43: And so you can actually look and go backwards.\n82:45: What are the habits that I need?\n82:46: What are the actions that I need?\n82:47: What are the words that I need?\n82:48: What are the thoughts that I have to like begin to instill to be able to, you know, go that way?\n82:53: Or you can go the other way, like, you know, oneness ideas and have those oneness ideas turn into words, turn into actions.\n82:59: So this is like a two, a bi directional flow.\n83:02: And you know the quote, right?\n83:04: Watch your thoughts, they become your words.\n83:06: Watch your words, they become your actions.\n83:07: Watch your actions, they become habits.\n83:09: Watch your habits, they become your character.\n83:11: And watch your character because it becomes your destiny.\n83:15: So these are all the guiding quotes that I'm working to sort of operationalize in a framework that I've really gone through many iterations.\n83:25: I'm going to try to find like the simplest version so that I can just show you.\n83:36: My God, which one might be it.\n83:42: Yeah.\n83:43: Okay, maybe this is it.\n83:49: Yeah, no, this is all still too complicated.\n83:52: But the basic idea, like I mentioned in the beginning, is like, go through our day and try to.\n84:01: I came up with many, many, many different ways of describing this process.\n84:07: I can see that.\n84:08: Yeah, I just want to find a simple one.\n84:10: Can't find them where's the simplest one.\n84:13: Okay, so maybe this one.\n84:14: So this is the onboarding process that we're doing right now.\n84:16: Welcome.\n84:17: Energy, emotion, all these.\n84:19: Gather some stories.\n84:20: And then the daily check in is kind of the.\n84:22: The way that things happen.\n84:24: It's like you check in body, emotional, any tension.\n84:29: And either yes or no.\n84:31: And if there are tensions.\n84:33: Oh, doesn't say this is not the one.\n84:35: Then pattern.\n84:38: Why am I attending?\n84:38: Okay.\n84:40: My goodness.\n84:42: Yeah, this is why I'm trying.\n84:44: Did you generate these with ChatGPT?\n84:46: Yeah, I'm trying to write an essay to kind of really clarify it instead of having all of these different versions.\n84:51: Okay.\n84:54: Yeah.\n84:55: So you notice the state we get into presence.\n84:58: And then you either are in one of two states, usually tension, and you either have two types.\n85:04: And we actually saw both of them today.\n85:06: So cap versus CAP is creativity versus friends.\n85:10: Both of them are meaningful for you.\n85:11: You want, like, it would be beautiful.\n85:13: Like, things that you would.\n85:14: You might be able to say, like, yeah, like that's how I want to be.\n85:17: I want to be able to have quality time with my friends or show them care and, you know, do something in an embodied way of my friends.\n85:23: And then the other one is the creativity thing.\n85:25: And then the other one is the call with your mom.\n85:27: Right.\n85:28: I should.\n85:29: The instrumental.\n85:30: I should call my mom because societal obligation, your mom's perspective, whatever it is, like norms, these external things.\n85:39: And.\n85:39: And also I wish I could call my mom in the morning.\n85:42: It would be awesome.\n85:43: I would connect with her.\n85:44: I love my mom and that kind of stuff.\n85:46: And then once you.\n85:47: You find attention, you do kind of what we did today, which is clarify, like, what is the tension about?\n85:53: What are the things that are meaningful about the thing behind that tension?\n85:59: And is it possible to rearrange things to make those actually happen rather than to grit your teeth.\n86:04: Teeth and grind or whatever it is.\n86:09: Yeah, I think that's it.\n86:11: That's the main one.\n86:12: Tension emerges, emotions identified.\n86:14: Is it blocked or is it logistics?\n86:16: You get the basic idea.\n86:18: It's actually not.\n86:19: What is so complicated?\n86:21: What is CAP and.\n86:23: Oh, values.\n86:25: And IAP is instrumental.\n86:27: So CAP would be like relationships, but it just described more specifically so you can actually get into what actually matters about something rather than like honesty, you know, and it's operationalizing.\n86:43: Where is it?\n86:43: Here, I'll show you.\n86:45: So for instance, let me find some of the.\n86:53: This is something that Joe Edelman worked on.\n86:56: This is Joe Edelman's paper.\n86:57: You might find it interesting, but like, I want to show you, like the, the Specific specificities of what a source of meaning looks like so that you can kind of understand what I mean by a cap.\n87:11: So this is a list of caps, okay?\n87:15: And these are all kinds of honesty.\n87:17: Like someone might say, like, oh, I value honesty.\n87:19: Right.\n87:19: But there's some people that value honesty, meaning embodied authenticity.\n87:24: Right.\n87:25: And what they are what he calls attending to or like, like noticing in that moment or paying attention to are opportunities to speak from my heart or a sense of settledness that arises when my words and actions align with my truth.\n87:39: Right.\n87:39: And this kind of embodied authenticity is very different than, you know, epistemic humility, clarifying, clarity that comes from carefully distinguishing facts versus speculations.\n87:53: Right.\n87:53: It's like more of an analysis kind of thing.\n87:55: Purpose, I feel, when I refine my beliefs in light of counter evidence.\n87:59: And that's a different kind of honesty from honest exchange.\n88:01: Right.\n88:02: Which is openings.\n88:03: I create my conversation for my partner to share their knowledge and experience, opportunities to acknowledge the limits of my own knowledge and experience.\n88:11: And these are all this is called the way that he's framing this are caps.\n88:17: These are all caps.\n88:18: This is a title and this is a description.\n88:21: But for his process, it's actually like a machine process.\n88:26: He needs them to be described in like a plural noun phrase and then a qualifying statement.\n88:33: And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take our conversation and then run it through an LLM to try to get some of these.\n88:39: And that way the LLM can actually know what is important to you in a way that's workable, like operationalizable.\n88:48: Like when you say, I like time with my friends, or like it's meaningful for me to have this call with Bilal, you know, I might even be able to say, like, why?\n88:58: What about it?\n88:59: And you could say, well, it was like an opportunity for.\n89:04: For me to like to open up more of my life and to create closeness or, you know, something like that.\n89:09: It's like opportunities for openness or things like that.\n89:13: And then once, once we have those clear, when you are doing this whole tension process, check in, where you check in, you say your energy, you give your to do list.\n89:23: And then it tries to determine which of them are IAPs and which of them are CAPs.\n89:30: So which of them are instrumental?\n89:32: Which can be things like, for instance, I have to go to work today.\n89:41: You know, for people, not us necessarily because we're weird, but like for lots of people, it's an instrumental thing.\n89:46: I go to work.\n89:47: So.\n89:48: So that.\n89:48: And if you can say that it's you're using an activity for something else.\n89:55: And, and it can become more meaningful.\n89:57: For instance, you can have an instrumental action like I'm setting my alarm clock so that I can wake up for prayer and call my mom, you know.\n90:06: But it kind of brings meaning into that action through intentionality.\n90:10: It still is instrumental.\n90:11: Like, it might not be the most exciting part of your day, but if you can actually touch base with that meaning, that intention, it might, it might turn it more into a cap, might turn it more into a source of meaning.\n90:24: It would require a very different sort of presence to be able to really feel that feeling when you're setting the alarm clock.\n90:31: But.\n90:32: But yeah.\n90:32: So certainly there's instrumental things to do in life.\n90:35: Absolutely.\n90:35: But a lot of people are in the have to dos and they're not clear.\n90:40: And I think a lot of it is actually related to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\n90:43: At least the first chunks, you know, like, like mortal actually breaks people's perspective on this a lot.\n90:51: Or at least he used to with wearing flip flops.\n90:54: Right.\n90:54: Why do I have to wear shoes?\n90:56: Is it because of a societal norm?\n90:58: Like, what if this is more comfortable for me?\n91:00: It's actually the way I want to be.\n91:02: What if the way that I want to be is actually to show people the pot, the bigger possibility space and to unlock people's creative thinking about life.\n91:08: And I want to wear flip flops.\n91:10: Right.\n91:10: And so his values can be.\n91:12: You can see it in that way.\n91:13: But many people might look at that and say, man, you have to wear shoes.\n91:17: Right.\n91:18: And that's the norm thing, which is connected to our need on Maslow's hierarchy of social connection.\n91:25: Right.\n91:25: We follow a lot of norms because we want to be with people.\n91:29: But there's this weird like double edged sword of.\n91:32: Because of that we're not actually with the people in a way that's meaningful.\n91:36: You know, following these norms and these things versus like a more authentic kind of experience where we're actually doing things based on our real sources of meaning.\n91:49: And so I have been trying to turn this into like a system prompt.\n91:56: These are all a bunch of ideas.\n91:58: Where are my prompts?\n91:58: Okay.\n92:00: And rationalize it.\n92:02: And it has like examples in real quotes and gives examples of how the assistant might want to respond.\n92:12: Actually, it might be interesting for you to show you my context file.\n92:15: So this is a context file.\n92:18: These are my patterns.\n92:22: These are some meaningful actions, rich context, some life context.\n92:27: Where am I living?\n92:30: Health support.\n92:31: I want to find my actual values though.\n92:35: Yeah.\n92:35: Here we Go caps.\n92:38: Parallel presence.\n92:39: Whenever a user engages in multiple threads, weaves many domains away once as a gift, not a liability.\n92:45: What am I noticing?\n92:46: I'm noticing how tasks inform each other in real time.\n92:49: I'm tracking my energy shifts.\n92:52: This was actually not a great cap.\n92:55: Yeah.\n92:56: Beauty recognition description.\n92:57: Spontaneous noticing a virtual Visually or spiritually striking moments.\n93:05: Yeah, These are my IAPs.\n93:07: Completion pressure.\n93:10: Deadlines, Shipping oils, Urgent tasks.\n93:12: And what do I notice?\n93:13: I'm looking.\n93:14: Oh, these are asaps.\n93:16: So this is a little bit different.\n93:17: This was another way I was trying to do this where this is not an ap, it's a potentially supportive ap.\n93:25: So it's saying, okay, if you're feeling this completion pressure, maybe these are some attention policies that might be able to support you in that place.\n93:34: But I want to look at my older context and it was surprisingly super nice actually.\n93:43: So.\n93:45: Yeah, context file.\n93:50: Okay.\n93:50: I don't know if I'll be able to find it like a good, A good version of my last context file because I've been making so many different versions.\n94:01: This is why I need these calls because I want to be able to make progress, right?\n94:07: And I want to be able to see what's interesting about this and how I can take it and share it with people in a way that's useful.\n94:17: Actually.\n94:17: We can even stop presenting now.\n94:19: So that's the basic idea.\n94:20: The basic idea is I want to use our to do list as the simplest diagnosis for a life well lived, right?\n94:29: And we can use that as an entry point into your world of meaning.\n94:35: Because every tension on your to do list for everything that you're doing, either something you do for something else or something you do for itself.\n94:44: And the things that we do for itself are things that we find meaningful in and of themselves, right?\n94:49: Otherwise we would do them for.\n94:50: For something else.\n94:51: And then the thing that we do for something else might be tangentially meaningful through intentionality, or it could be problematic and.\n95:02: And be something that you're just showing up in a certain way because you have to write about the shoes kind of thing.\n95:09: And then after the, after that, check in where we look at your to do list and we see like, which ones are foundationally meaningful and which ones are not.\n95:19: We check in with what you feel about the to do list, what you feel about, like, your day.\n95:25: Because those feelings are going to give us, like, point us towards either competing sources of meaning or values.\n95:34: Right?\n95:35: Like we had today with Mustafa and creativity, or competing instrumental things and sources of values.\n95:44: Like, I really, I just have to go to work, but I really want to spend quality time with my baby.\n95:48: But I have to go to work, right?\n95:49: And then the art of life is understanding all of this through self reflection, understanding what is really meaningful about all of these things and how you can bring more moments of meaning.\n96:06: And one of the biggest like steps is actually just knowing what's meaningful for you, like in a more clearly defined way, rather than, you know, like connections or relationships or something like that.\n96:21: And then, and then making it practical.\n96:23: So that's why it's a coaching thing, because it's not just about this understanding.\n96:27: It's.\n96:27: It's literally about making a to do list and checking in and making it so that more of those things on the list are going to make you come alive.\n96:36: And then the like of it all is your life is better.\n96:40: Everyone who engages with your life is better.\n96:42: And at some point, inshallah, like this whole flourishing world thing happens, you know, it's like to realize that this is the best way for you to live instead of thinking about all the problems that are existing and what you can do about it, you know, or thinking about all of your struggles in your life and how you can get rich so that at one point you can retire, right?\n97:03: And that there's something to be trusted here and then to.\n97:07: To do that.\n97:08: That's why it's connected to the whole Islamic perspective.\n97:11: Because my belief, this is a big difference between my work and job, Joe's work, is that Joe suggests that in a meaningful moment we have something called an attentional policy.\n97:22: That's what AP stands for, attentional policy.\n97:25: I choose to notice Moja's smile when he's talking to me, you know, or whatever it is like, you know, the moments of honest connection or in the honesty thing.\n97:38: And that's an intentional policy that, that we kind of value is just a cluster of ways that we've chosen to show up in a moment that's meaningful.\n97:47: The reframe for me is we actually experience a moment.\n97:54: Are you frozen?\n97:56: No, no, I'm here.\n97:58: We actually experience a moment that is meaningful and it can make our hair stand up on end.\n98:04: It can make our.\n98:05: It can take our breath away, right?\n98:06: And the I ness isn't really there.\n98:09: And the idea of looking for our attentional policy isn't really there.\n98:14: We can only reflect after the fact and see which chambers of our heart was resonating with the divine possibility of goodness in that moment.\n98:23: So basically, God is the good, the source of all meaning, the source of all goodness possible.\n98:30: But you Have a specific goodness that's going to be for you in this moment, in this context, in your life.\n98:38: And our attentional policies are actually just looking back at that moment and seeing what's resonating.\n98:45: And that teaches us something.\n98:47: This is the whole thing of, like, looking within and like, learning something.\n98:51: Like, in different meaningful moments.\n98:53: It could be a profoundly meaningful moment for lots of people.\n98:55: Like, we went and did camping and we left and we're like, wow, that was really great.\n98:58: And the cool thing is everyone's going to say something else about what was really the most meaningful thing about them, right?\n99:03: We've, we've had these experiences, and that's because God chose different.\n99:07: So I'm going to use a religious language now.\n99:08: I've been trying not to use any religious language, but, like, I think it's important for me to demonstrate why I'm doing the, the pairing between the, the coaching and the theory behind what values are and the philosophy and this kind of religious perspective is because it's different.\n99:24: It actually shows that you can look back and notice these things and realize that they're not some arbitrary attention policy.\n99:36: It's actually like, you can call it a communication from God.\n99:39: And of course, if you want to take a systems think approach or harmonization of systems or the big magic kind of approach, like, ideas are forces at play of everything in the whole universe working for this story to want to come through today.\n99:57: And if, if you don't tell the story, it will come to somebody else.\n100:00: Or, you know, like, there's ways of thinking in terms of resonances and patterns and systems and like, you have a certain, like, configuration and you're in the world and it like, resonates within you.\n100:14: Or you can use the religious language, but that's the idea is that we're not actually choosing these policies.\n100:20: They choose us.\n100:21: And then from there we can either choose to create more moments for those things to come alive, and that's kind of serving our purpose.\n100:29: And when we take the, the Muslim perspective, like, doing this thing of like, noticing when your heart opens up isn't just a, like, oh, it feels good, it's a nice thing.\n100:37: It's a moment of like, divine revelation telling you who you should be and how you should show up in the world.\n100:42: And it's a responsibility.\n100:43: And that, that kind of framing makes it like, for, for, for the people that believe at least gives it, I think, gives your sense of meaning meaning, gives your sense of like, this sense of like, wow, this is a meaningful moment.\n100:56: What is God telling me right now about how I should live my life.\n100:59: And that moment of joy that you felt when you're thinking about your mom and waking up early and who you want to be, and like, that is you kind of connecting to the all good, the all merciful showing up in your life, resonating your heart, and.\n101:12: And you can help you create something like divine love rather than, oh, God, so far away.\n101:18: It's like, no.\n101:19: Why do you think these things that are meaningful make your hair stand up on end and bring you to life?\n101:23: Like, the source of life is obviously here.\n101:25: Right.\n101:26: Anyway, so there's like, the religious interpretation that I'm trying to pair very precisely with, like, what Joe Edelman is doing with the values with a slight shift on.\n101:37: You're not choosing the attentional policies, they choose you.\n101:41: And that also informs the coaching a little bit differently.\n101:44: Instead of asking, like, what did you.\n101:46: You know, like, what do you choose?\n101:47: How do you want to show up or you want to.\n101:50: We ask, like, what do you notice?\n101:52: You know, what.\n101:53: What shines within you, like, what brings your heart to life?\n101:55: And what do you think that means?\n101:57: And.\n101:57: And that kind of stuff.\n101:59: Slight language changes, but I think important because it gives meaning.\n102:04: Meaning.\n102:10: Well, I.\n102:14: This.\n102:14: This sounds so cool.\n102:15: And I would like to actually start to try this and.\n102:19: And see how the LLM ties into all of this, because there's.\n102:22: It sounds like there's a lot of philosophy.\n102:24: Yeah.\n102:25: And LLM is a tool that kind of opens a window into this philosophy.\n102:31: I mean, I could also give you a worksheet, really simple.\n102:36: You make a to do list.\n102:38: You ask yourself what would make today feel complete.\n102:42: And then you keep, like, looking to see why you don't do those things.\n102:48: And you have.\n102:48: You reflect and you could do it.\n102:51: You could do it with Bilal.\n102:52: Right now, we're doing it with Bilal.\n102:55: But then the hope is that know, like, right now I have all these notes that we've taken together, and we've some patterns, and we've already noticed some, like, interesting sources of meaning.\n103:06: And it doesn't have to be the LLM, right?\n103:10: The.\n103:10: The thing that it needs is, like, these.\n103:13: These foundational building blocks.\n103:15: If you want to think of, like, the context file, it would be what are the detected instrumental actions that you take?\n103:22: You know, what are the detected sources of meaning for you?\n103:27: You know, what are the ways that they interfere with each other, creating tensions?\n103:33: What emotions show up in those tensions?\n103:36: And so that's actually the majority of the structure.\n103:40: And then it would be extracting Stories to fit into each of those things.\n103:44: Like, I believe that this is a tension that forms this pattern because Moj told me the story about, you know, calling his mom.\n103:53: It would actually have ground Truth and goal would be like, like my goal today is, you know, to let you go pee and think about it.\n104:04: To direct your gaze to things so that you have that realization.\n104:09: Because personal growth is not.\n104:10: It can never happen from somebody else.\n104:12: It cannot give you growth, you know, but we can help you realize and notice and direct to see things for what they are so that new behaviors and opportunities emerge from there.\n104:23: And that's the goal.\n104:24: So, you know, like, we don't necessarily need the LLM.\n104:26: I can give you a system prompt.\n104:28: I can try to make your context file.\n104:30: But also like, it would be just great to share things more openly and maybe you can help me because actually the, the system prompt, I always have to like configure it a little bit more.\n104:44: I'm like, you know, I need you to be a little bit more pokey.\n104:47: Like don't just tell me everything, you know.\n104:50: Another really great question is, show me the things that I'm refusing to see, you know, and add those into the system prompt.\n104:58: But like, I'm sure you might discover more.\n105:01: And instead of me trying to come up with like the perfect system prompt that makes you feel great at the the same time, like, you know, what we're trying to get to in terms of self reflection, understanding our patterns, looking for those moments of tension, understanding what those emotions are saying about what matters to us.\n105:18: Like that's what we're trying to get.\n105:20: If that's not happening, then you can like kind of direct it with more quotes and then tell me like it wasn't working so great until I told it to reflect back any value it finds whenever it finds one or assumes it finds one, and then actually became better because that's what, you know, so maybe I should just give you the things as they are because I've been tweaking and tweaking and getting into my, my rabbit hole.\n105:44: That's my pattern.\n105:45: And I realized, you know, you know what it's related to.\n105:48: I realized that I have low self esteem and that I don't think I'm worth people's time.\n105:56: I'm worth.\n105:56: Unless I made something perfect and beautiful and like, and intelligence and, and wonderful and like just perfect, you know, like just great.\n106:04: And I can defend it.\n106:06: I thought of every single direction, I thought of every single counter argument I've got, every single quote from every Single religion.\n106:12: And I've mapped it to all the philosophers from Charles Taylor to Joe Edelman, you know, like, until I get that rigor, I can't share it because then they'll know that I'm stupid, I'm a fraud, waste of time, you know, and, and so I like, I get into this rabbit hole and it's totally instrumental, has nothing to do with how I want.\n106:30: It's protecting myself.\n106:32: And instead of.\n106:35: And so actually like this call and I've had actually now with one with Dara and also with Pascal, is actually me using my own coaching method.\n106:43: And like through the prompt.\n106:46: Like, one of the nice things about the pro prompt is at some point you get tired of yourself whenever you see a pattern emerge.\n106:54: Like this rabbit hole thing.\n106:55: I've told it like, I really should be working on something else right now, but I really want to get this right.\n107:01: Gonna keep working, you know, and it might not even be the LLM doing the work at all, but it's you just being like, I don't.\n107:08: I'm embarrassed to tell you, like me.\n107:16: But also, I was never really that clear about my low self esteem.\n107:19: It's still something I'm trying to figure out why.\n107:21: I know my parents complain to other people and other kids and I know like, there's something about intelligence and being worthy that for my, for my parents to accept me or I have to prove something.\n107:34: My report card was my ability to like be proud.\n107:38: Right?\n107:39: That was like, that was it.\n107:40: That was the highlights of our time.\n107:41: Time at home of like.\n107:42: And so often there'd be so much shame to like, intelligence not being present if I got bad grades or something as a representation of that and, and like seeing it is the first step.\n107:54: But like, what can I do instead?\n107:58: And I think, you know, it's one.\n107:59: Of the first things I said.\n108:00: It's like to trust that actually the more beautiful way, the thing that I would wish I could actually be, but I struggle with is to kind of trust that I can give what I have to somebody like you share like, you know, this is my, my best prompt so far and you actually know like where I've come from and not give you.\n108:18: I've made maybe hundreds of different diagrams representing different ways this thing can arrange.\n108:24: Right.\n108:28: One and the system prompt.\n108:30: And yeah, you have the recording.\n108:34: Like what you could do is send it through ChatGPT and I'll give you Joe's system prompt for finding values cards and say, can you help me extract three values cards from this conversation?\n108:46: Ask me any Questions to help you get the depth that you need to articulate it and then you know, we can do it together rather than just having me pretend like I've got everything figured out.\n109:01: Wow, that is cool though.\n109:03: It's just like the, it sounds like you're using your coaching method on yourself and that's helping you understand yourself better.\n109:12: Yeah.\n109:12: And I, it sounds like a good tool.\n109:14: I'm, I want to use it.\n109:17: Let's see what I can find out.\n109:19: And like the other part is I realized that one of the things actually another pattern that I found is I'm not sure I forget exactly how it goes, but it's something like I need, here's the instrumental need to make passive income by creating technology that scales so that I can be safe.\n109:38: Right.\n109:39: Instead of acknowledge I'm a good facilitator.\n109:44: I can hold space.\n109:45: I can help people create like moments of insights with them.\n109:50: I can like think with them about the connections that span the entire conversation and help them see the oneness in the conversation that might be like inspiring.\n109:59: Like that's, that's stuff that I can do that like my brain and body and like, like, and it is way more alive than me trying to program.\n110:07: Like me trying to program is like, I have an idea, I want it to happen because instrumental, instrumental, instrumental.\n110:12: I can make some passive money by making technology at scales.\n110:16: I can, I can help the world better by making something that scales versus like trusting the voice of God that says like, dude, you're like good people.\n110:25: Like just get personal, you know, like do more realization.\n110:32: And, and so I'm actually thinking of releasing this thing in parallel.\n110:37: So it's.\n110:38: I do the onboarding call like we just did and then we have like once a week check ins but in between.\n110:46: And so I'm not cutting myself out of the system.\n110:48: I'm not saying, well, here's the prompt and here's the philosophy and go change the world.\n110:51: It's like, no, like somehow I still matter.\n110:54: And it's kind of interesting that that self worth thing actually shows up here too.\n110:58: It's like ideas.\n110:59: The only intelligence is the only thing that matter.\n111:02: Here's the, the system prompt and the paper and someone kill me already, you know, it's like, no.\n111:21: This is great.\n111:22: This is very helpful, man.\n111:23: And yeah, I mean just this one call that we did today, I like this throughout the call, honestly, I want to be also transparent with this.\n111:35: From the first 10 minutes or the first five minutes, I kept wanting to interrupt you to say thank you.\n111:43: I really Appreciate the.\n111:46: The amount of work that you've done before, the call that has led to this really meaningful time and this great conversation.\n111:54: So many insights coming out in this conversation.\n111:56: It's very helpful for me.\n111:58: Like, it's helped me understand and myself better.\n112:01: And I, you know, I thank you.\n112:04: Thank you for.\n112:05: For giving this to me and giving me your time and all of this effort you've put into it.\n112:18: Yeah.\n112:19: Yeah.\n112:19: So it's.\n112:21: It's very, very good, man.\n112:23: It's.\n112:24: Thank you for doing it.\n112:25: Inshallah.\n112:26: Inshallah.\n112:27: And.\n112:27: And thank you for choosing me to be one of the people who try it out.\n112:30: Oh, yeah, no, definitely.\n112:32: I mean, you of all people, I think, can really appreciate what we're getting at here.\n112:38: And maybe even like, one day we'll have this bigger conversation about, like, you know, one of my goals is to write a book, right?\n112:48: But one of the things that I'm thinking about with this process is, is like, how do I become the person that a book emerges from?\n112:54: You know, because a goal is usually instrumental.\n112:58: It's like, I want this in the future because it's not now.\n113:01: It's not something that you want to sit with and be with because it's meaningful in and of itself.\n113:06: It's an idea in the future that you can't even be with because it's out there, right?\n113:10: And so become the person that writes every day, that shares what they write on a blog or that, you know, that connect whatever the qualities and way of being that makes me, the book is likely to spring forth from.\n113:24: That's what I would like our to do lists to look like.\n113:27: Rather than a business that makes a lot of money, that's.\n113:31: Not that it's a problem to make a lot of money, but like the idea of this goal for the business even.\n113:37: And so I know it sounds like super personal, but I do think that this is a really beautiful way to get them to get the best out of people.\n113:45: Right.\n113:45: Both at work and yourself in a way that's really authentic and sincere and not using people, you know, and not letting people even use themselves.\n113:55: Let's say somebody's great at programming but.\n113:57: But really hates it.\n113:59: I'm sure they're.\n113:59: They exist, right?\n114:00: They might be like, really good at it, but for whatever reason, it doesn't.\n114:05: It's.\n114:06: It's not what, you know, it's not resonating in chambers of their heart.\n114:09: It's.\n114:09: It's a skill.\n114:10: But that.\n114:11: That's unlikely to.\n114:12: To happen.\n114:12: But you get the basic idea like there might be somebody using themselves.\n114:17: You know, maybe they take a bunch of Adderall, maybe they do some stuff where they're actually forcing themselves into a configuration where they can.\n114:25: Like, I know people that love math, but they love the elegance, they love the beauty, they love the theoretical math.\n114:31: But they went to Manhattan to work in quantified trading because they, they told themselves, I'll just do this so I can pay off my student loans.\n114:41: So that, so that, so that.\n114:42: And because of the instrument, they built a life that's really hard to escape.\n114:48: And.\n114:49: But the thing that was there initially was the love for math.\n114:51: And like, what would have happened if they stayed true to the things that make them glow the brightest and brings the energy that people, you know, so many people complain about lack of energy and sluggishness and drinking coffee.\n115:02: And this is why I think, like, we instrumentalize even ourselves, you know, and we thought of our workplaces as places where people maybe they have to leave, it might be that they have to leave and we find other people that, you know, the way that they come to life is the way that the, the, the organism of the work needs, right?\n115:20: We need to find those people where that match is there.\n115:23: And so I think of this as like a coaching method for, you know what they say, like how you do anything is, is how you do everything to work with beauty so that the results are beautiful.\n115:37: Right?\n115:38: And I don't think we can like grind ourselves at work because we want to achieve certain goals versus how do I become the person where this naturally unflow, like overflows from me at service to the divine beauty that wants to manifest in the container of this work such that like, together with all these other people, the streams, you know, come together and we become a raging river of like, you know, going towards a place, but not having the, the ocean be like a dream, but to have, you know, the journey be the destination.\n116:11: This is how we make success every step.\n116:12: And so at some point, like, I love to do these kinds of things for business and for people because I do think that this is how we create the transformation that I've been trying to do my whole life with my work.\n116:23: And like, how do we connect, like, you know, work and business and social impact and whatever.\n116:29: But I've realized that this is, that that was always external.\n116:33: And I was going from like, technical to like using machines to using businesses to using ourself and even this whole thing like mindfulness based stress reduction and using meditation so that you can get in the zone and Focus at work is still using instead of serving.\n116:53: And this is why this is.\n116:55: I think, you know, I'll always learn.\n116:57: I'll probably change my mind at some point, but I think that this is a pivot in my work as well.\n117:02: It's kind of really important to help people see, like, why, you know, some people are saying, like, everything is getting better, you know, by all these metrics, like, why is the world getting better?\n117:14: But, like, we still see so much suicide.\n117:18: We see like people feeling meaninglessness and there's like the meaning epidemic.\n117:23: And it's because we've disconnected the idea of work and life, you know, And I think this is as a way to begin to disconnect conversation of, like, what else?\n117:38: Like, can we be measuring that matters?\n117:41: And.\n117:44: And I.\n117:45: I think that I'm getting more and more confident about this idea of like, helping more people trust the fact that they have a heart and that it's reliable and that this isn't like some airy fairy stuff.\n117:56: Like, you know, people think that the.\n117:58: The world just matter and stuff, and that's why we need to save the fish and count the fish, and that's why we need to prevent poverty and count the money that people have.\n118:06: Rather than talk about the quality of presence.\n118:09: Everyone knows that things have quality, that we can feel right, that these things actually are the things that matter.\n118:14: But because we can't, we haven't aligned as a society to say that that is true, that is real, and here's a rigorous way of describing it that we can kind of align across cultures.\n118:25: We've just decided to ignore it and we focused on the superficial, the stuff that doesn't matter, that doesn't make any difference.\n118:32: And we're like racing to save the world that no one wants to live in, you know, versus the very fact of having a life that you like, you want to live.\n118:43: And the feeling contentedness.\n118:45: Suddenly imagine how much consumption will decrease.\n118:47: So much consumption happens because people are feeling holes.\n118:50: Traveling to places that they travel, eating things they don't need to eat, buying things that they don't need to buy, wastage of like, like fast fashion.\n118:58: Contentedness can be like an overnight transformation.\n119:03: Imagine if we just like snapped our fingers and people found their meaning.\n119:06: Yeah.\n119:07: To begin that process of like, saying, like, okay, you want to change the world?\n119:11: Well, change yourself.\n119:12: And so there is that other element of like, how does this move bloom from.\n119:17: To the next stage?\n119:18: It started with like, GEMC and technology and then communities and using technology, using communities, using people, businesses using People, too.\n119:28: Finally stopping this using thing and, like, admitting the fact that there's, you know, there's being anyway and that it matters.\n119:36: For all the other stuff that we want, it actually gets.\n119:39: Gets all that stuff, too.\n119:50: That's very interesting.\n119:53: I want to think about that some more, and I want to understand it some more.\n119:57: The difference of going from using to being.\n120:04: Because I'm similar in that way.\n120:05: Right.\n120:06: Like, you and I, we're kind of trying.\n120:11: Trying, like, we're trying to get to the same points and, like, we're trying to.\n120:16: Our missions are similar, or we're just doing it.\n120:21: You're doing it from France, and I'm doing it from Iraq.\n120:24: Yeah.\n120:25: I think our missions are similar.\n120:27: And, like, even our trajectories and our insights, you know, like, you talking about oneness and why it matters.\n120:32: You know, like, you asked me one day, like, why does oneness matter?\n120:36: And I think I'm beginning to really get convinced about, like, why this idea of Tawheed is so powerful and so important.\n120:44: And part of it is this idea of we can talk about, like, there's.\n120:50: There's the pure manifest, like, manifesting good in the spirit that wants to show up in the world.\n120:57: But it looks differently for me, and it looks differently for you.\n121:00: But when you let go of your, like, your story, your perspective, and you hear how I try to respond to my context in a way that, like, makes me come alive, I think you can appreciate it.\n121:17: And we can actually learn to appreciate everyone because we are connected to the source of all of the difference, all of the different ways people.\n121:26: People can be beautiful, right?\n121:28: There's so many movies.\n121:29: You know, you watch a movie and you can, like, find these things that are moving for you.\n121:32: Right?\n121:32: And the nice thing about that is, first of all, is, like, you know, this idea of the fact that it, like, resonates with you partially means that it's a potential within you because we have that access to the oneness.\n121:46: So one of the interesting things about oneness is that it helps us appreciate everybody.\n121:52: And it's actually what shows up in Joe's work in his values graph.\n121:56: And it actually makes it make sense.\n121:57: He's like, when we show people how people determine between a wise action and another wise action, people can agree because there's so much disagreements in the world right now, like, Republican values or conservative.\n122:14: Like, conservative values versus Democratic values or liberal values or Islamic values.\n122:18: And, like, people are thinking that we're just gonna have a values war, right?\n122:21: And that everyone's gonna be Different.\n122:22: They like different things because they have culture and it's subjective.\n122:26: But if there, if there is a God and there is like this like truth of like goodness and values, we can actually tell the story deeply enough so that people can see what we see and resonate because they have that oneness within them.\n122:48: Even if it resonates differently for them in, in their context, if they take on your context and your understanding and your world view and your place, they will be able to see the beauty in the action.\n122:58: But that's only possible.\n123:00: There's actually only one source of goodness and, and, and meaning.\n123:04: If there was like multiples, then of course, like, that's what people are saying, that there's multiples, that there's like Western values.\n123:11: Right.\n123:12: They talk about Western values versus the rest and that these are the best somehow because they're, they make money.\n123:20: But yeah, so that's, that's actually, I think, a really big deal.\n123:24: And I think even, just, even the, the downstream effects of getting people more clear about what is meaningful for them, I think is, is a good, a good way to live, a good kind of work to do.\n123:37: Inshallah.\n123:42: Thank you for this call.\n123:44: And we, when we finish.\n123:45: What's it called?\n123:45: We like do our.\n123:47: Do you want to try?\n123:47: Like, I haven't.\n123:48: I've had this theory of this kind of like once a week coaching plus the LLM prompt share thing.\n123:56: You want me to try the whole thing?\n123:57: And we have another call like in a week, Monday.\n124:00: That's right.\n124:01: Yeah.\n124:01: Yeah.\n124:02: About your mom.\n124:03: I'll ask you about your feelings.\n124:05: I'll ask you about like, ways that week where you inspired yourself or like looking back, it was like meaningful ways that you kind of let yourself down.\n124:13: Anyway, that's for next week, but yeah, I'll give you the prompt in the meantime.\n124:17: And the other thing is, yeah, there's a bit of a commitment.\n124:20: Like, it would be nice if you could check in at least morning and evening using the prompt.\n124:27: Like, you know, two rounds.\n124:30: Like just, you know, send the prompt.\n124:32: It's gonna ask you for your check in answers.\n124:33: It'll probably ask you a couple questions.\n124:35: You can answer those.\n124:36: That's two rounds.\n124:37: So two rounds in the morning, two rounds in the evening.\n124:40: More if you want, but if it's helpful.\n124:43: But that would be the thing that would, I think, also help me get real understanding of what's actually valuable.\n124:50: And you know, when we meet, you can tell me what works, what didn't, what, what adaptations you gave it because you could tell it like Stop saying that.\n124:59: Or, like, give me, you know, I'm sure you'll come up with some good ideas.\n125:07: Yeah, I'm down.\n125:08: I'll.\n125:08: I'll.\n125:10: Let me try it for this week, see how it goes, have another call, and then we'll go from there.\n125:16: And it shouldn't feel like a chore.\n125:18: Like, the things thing that it's trying to help you do is to pick, like, a meaningful thing to bring into your day so it will hopefully feel exciting, you know, and your goal is to discover.\n125:28: Discover that.\n125:29: To bring, like, at least one moment, you know, in your day.\n125:33: That's.\n125:33: What is it.\n125:33: What would make today feel complete or something like that.\n125:37: It might ask a question like that.\n125:40: So it's a week of meaning that you're committing to.\n125:42: Let's see.\n125:42: Or it's having attempted meaning.\n125:47: Yeah, no, if that's a good point.\n125:49: If it.\n125:49: If it does become a chore, I should flag that, I guess.\n125:52: Yeah.\n125:52: If it's like, not working out or something.\n125:55: Yeah, yeah, it's.\n125:56: It like, but.\n125:58: But your direction in the prompting and in the talking is I'm, like, reviewing my emotions and my to do list to find either tensions to clear or emotions to indicate, like, what ways of being are being blocked that actually wants to happen.\n126:14: This is why, like, I get.\n126:15: I'm gonna give you the kind of flowchart and the framework so that you know what the thing is trying to do.\n126:20: Because all of those things, all they're trying to do is, like, use your emotions to point that, meaning that you could bring in or look at conflicts between your different types of meaningful actions or meaningful actions and instrumental actions, and ask how you can creatively reconfigure them.\n126:36: Like going and being in silence with Mustafa at the thing, or I don't know, whatever you're gonna wind up doing.\n126:42: So, like, keep that in mind when you're using it.\n126:43: Like, it shouldn't be a chore.\n126:44: It should be like, okay, if it's not doing that, I should be thinking about that.\n126:48: Like, your goal is.\n126:51: I'm coaching you personally.\n126:53: I'm telling you that's the goal.\n126:54: The tool should help.\n126:55: And if it doesn't, like, you can rework it, or you can just use it journaling about these things.\n127:01: Like, what are my emotions?\n127:02: What are they blocking?\n127:03: What meaningful things are conflicting, or meaningful and instrumental things are conflicting, and what can I do about that?\n127:09: And the rest of the prompt is just supposed to kind of systematize that, make it like a reflection.\n127:14: But for you, you can use paper if you want.\n127:18: If it's a chore with a system, just use paper.\n127:21: I'll give you the worksheet or something too.\n127:26: Okay, let's try it and see how it goes.\n127:29: Send me the recording and enjoy your maybe.\n127:32: What's it called?\n127:33: Your maybe.\n127:35: Sauna?\n127:36: Yeah, your.\n127:39: Your creative time.\n127:40: And you call your mom and I'll talk to you soon.\n127:43: Thank you, habibi.\n127:45: See you soon.\n127:47: Bye.\n127:47: By."

It particularly emphasizes:\n1. The connection between values and concrete evidence\n2. The integration of competing values\n3. Clear development paths forward\n4. Strong grounding in actual quotes and experiences\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of this integration or elaborate on any section?",
