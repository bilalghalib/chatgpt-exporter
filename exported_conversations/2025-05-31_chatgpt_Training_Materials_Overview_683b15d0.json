Mohammed had to design the entire solar system around ensuring this coffee machine would always work because the client prioritized hosting guests above all else. This shows how solar design must account for cultural priorities, not just technical specs.\nThe 20,000 Panel Pepsi Factory Project\n\"هاي بغداد. أصبغ طعم المرسى، وضبط طعم المرسى... حتتركبون 20,000 لا؟... الفريق 30 شخص.\" Mohammed's team installed 20,000 solar panels at a Pepsi factory in Baghdad with a 30-person crew. He contrasts this massive industrial project with residential work to show the complexity difference - industrial projects need different inverter systems, different calculations, and different expertise entirely.\nThe First Mosul Solar Project (2020)\n\"هاي صورة أول مشروع اشتغلتونا بالطاقة الشمسية... أول مدرسة بالموصل آه بسنة 2020، كان عبارة المشروع عن أكبر منظومة طاقة شمسية بالموصل 110 لوح وقتها.\" This was the largest solar installation in Mosul at the time - 110 panels on a school. It shows how recently solar adoption began in Mosul compared to other areas.\nThe Tomato Seller Who Installs Solar\nMohammed tells about a customer calling with problems: \"قلت له منو نصب لك إي مواكيل؟ قال لي محمد وأني ما أعرفه، قلت له هذا يبيع طماطة... قال والله قال لي ما بتحتاج تعريض وار إي ما يكلمك، قلت له يكلمك شنو؟ أسقط؟\"\nThe story continues with the tomato seller having installed a $3,000 system without proper grounding. When Mohammed told the customer they need to add grounding for $100, the customer refused, saying it was too expensive - despite having just spent $3,000 on the system. This illustrates the dangerous ignorance in the market.\nStories from Ali Akban\nThe Anbar Villager and WiFi Configuration\n\"قبل فترة واحد من الامبار تواصل معانا رجل قروي، فأول ما خابرني... قلت له حبيبي أنت من تاخذ تويوتا بكب إي؟ قلت له على شركة تويوتا ب باليابان، لو تروح ع الوكيل، قال ع الوكيل إي، قلت له تروح ع الوكيل، ما لك بالأنبار؟ يقول لي والله روحوا طويلة... يقول الواي، فاي ما عليه مزق بال، ما عاد يتبرمج... يقول لي فيديو خاص مع الشركة... والله هذا الفيديو كذب. بس دعاية مالكم\"\nThe villager from Anbar couldn't configure his inverter's WiFi and blamed the company. Ali had to explain using the Toyota dealership analogy - you go to the local dealer, not Toyota Japan. The man insisted their instructional video was \"just propaganda.\" This shows the trust issues and technical literacy gaps in rural markets.\nThe Fire Detection System Development\nAli developed a fire detection system for oil refineries in Erbil where false positives were common due to high gas concentrations and temperatures. He trained an AI model on 8,300 images and combined it with sensor data using Kalman filters to reduce false alarms. \"في أربيل خارج، خلينا نقول أربيل مصافي النفط، فهناك نسبة الغاز عالية إم و نسبة الحرارة تقرأ النفاير، لكنه لا يوجد فاير\" - This shows how Iraqi conditions require specialized solutions.\nThe Sulaymaniyah Business Culture vs Mosul\n\"أعطيك مثال السليمانية كلش واعين بها الموضوع مقارنة برميل، وموصل... حتى عندهم سكول سنتر، فتتواصل معاي الموظفة من كول سنتر أستاذ علي، بعد ما سوينا أوردر الإنفرتر، أعتقد دي مشكلة، دخلوا أنتوا نخليهم يربطون أونلاين وندخل، إحنا ع السيستم سوفتير، الريموتلي\"\nIn Sulaymaniyah, they have call centers for solar support and can remotely diagnose systems. In Mosul, people still think solar is \"1-1.5 million dinars and doesn't work.\" This stark contrast shows regional development gaps.\nStories from Hussam Falih\nThe Career Pivot Story\n\"ما هي أنا المشكلة يعني درست هندسة حاسبات بالموصل كهارد وير، كملت صار لي سبع سنين منظمات دولية ووكالات عالمية، أشتغل، بعدين من جيت أربيل وشفت الوضع...\" After 7 years working with international organizations (UN, USAID, etc.), Hussam pivoted to solar energy, combining his hardware engineering background with market needs.\nThe ITC Entrepreneurship Training Impact\n\"من طيب كداتا نارز، جميل، وقت يعرف صالح صالح، إثنين من أخذوا التدريب، عندي عندي بنت لقت شغل بهاندي كاب وولد، لقى بمنظمة أخرى أخرى آ كميل أسيست\" - Two of his trainees found jobs because the training was a \"journey\" not just information transfer. He emphasized starting from zero and building up gradually.\nThe 200-Person Training Challenge\n\"سووا جلسة صديقي فراس أخو صالح السيرجاع. في فندق روتانا... تقريبا ميتين شخص. من ها الميتين، إذا، إذا خمسة حولوا وصاروا، وكلاء منون وجيساتش، حققوا هدفهم\" - At a Ramadan event at Rotana Hotel, they brought 200 people to convince them to switch solar suppliers. Only 5 actually switched, showing how hard market change is.\nStories from Saud Maan\nFrom Engineer to Translator Journey\n\"عندي شو اسمه عندي خبرة بال بالتدوين من أني صغير آ فصار عندي بالشغلة كأنه مدون بالجرايد والصحف إم، بعدين الإنجليزي مالتي بدء يتطور بسبب العمل مالتي، وأيضا الفيديو جيمز... i have، started to translate books، with social economy and politics as well also a history\"\nSaud's path from childhood blogger to newspaper writer, improving English through work and video games, then translating books on economics and politics while being an electrical engineer shows the importance of diverse skills.\nLiving with Saleh (Mosul Space Founder)\n\"أني وصار أني وصالح مؤسس بوصل سبيس، تخرجنا من نفس القسم من الهندسة. الكهرباء. أنا كنت الأول على قسمي وصالح كان الثاني عالقسم بالتسلسل. وكنا عايشين سوى أيام الدراسة بشقة.\" - He was #1 in electrical engineering, Saleh was #2, and they lived together as roommates. This connection to Mosul Space's founder adds credibility.\nThe Yahya Success Story\nSaud trained someone named Yahya who later worked at BEET and won third place in a hackathon. \"كان موجود معانا بيت هسع حاليا بألمانيا يشتغل... بسبب المعلومات اللي أعطينه، هي، هو يروح كان آ الأساتذة بالجامعة إنه يناقشهم ويفحمهم\" - Yahya would debate and \"defeat\" university professors because his practical training was superior to their theoretical knowledge. He now works in Germany.\n\nMuayad Hasan's Stories\nThe Mismatched Solar Panel Teaching Moment\nWhen teaching about series connections, Muayad tells his students: \"Look, once during my work, I connected a panel with known specifications in series with another panel whose specifications were unknown. What do you think I found?\" He uses this to make them think about series vs parallel connections and what determines the output. He then reveals what happened, turning theoretical knowledge into a memorable incident that students recall when they encounter similar situations in the field.\nThe Desert Village Project (Shabka/Shabja)\nMuayad describes visiting a remote village in the Najaf desert called Shabka or Shabja - completely isolated from the national electricity grid, operating only on diesel generators. The village has 75 houses and serves as a hub for Bedouins who come for water supplies and medical help. There's no paved road between Najaf and this village - 200km of unpaved desert. The village's main problem is diesel fuel supply. They approached this challenge as part of the government buildings conversion project, recognizing it as one of the most remote and challenging installations.\nThe Customer Who Maximized Solar Usage\nA customer came with 18 panels thinking big for the future. But when they calculated, the load was only 14 amps. They removed unnecessary loads during peak hours, designed the house efficiently, and ended up with 30 amps of panel capacity feeding the system. The customer asked \"What do I do with all this extra power?\" So they connected the upper floor and ground floor separately as independent systems, reaching 20-22 amps usage. The customer then wanted to add split AC units to use the remaining capacity, showing how proper design can lead to expanded usage rather than waste.\nThe 1000+ Government Buildings Initiative\nMuayad was part of a team of less than 10 people who conducted feasibility studies for over 1,000 government buildings to convert them to eco-friendly structures. For each building, they did site visits, measured spaces and loads, assessed user needs, created preliminary designs showing system size, coverage percentage, cost savings, and carbon emission reductions. They developed an economic model for payback periods. This was provided as free technical consultancy to the National Initiative for Energy Support and Emission Reduction, led by the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Electricity.\nMustafa Waleed's Stories\nThe Car Wash Business Transformation\nA car wash owner approached Mustafa, initially uninterested. Mustafa asked: \"How much do you pay for electricity?\" The owner replied he pays 700 dollars per month just for diesel generator fuel to run his generators, plus about 500 for national grid electricity - totaling around 1,500 dollars monthly just for power. Mustafa calculated that with sufficient space and a solar system (since car washes operate during daylight), the owner could eliminate generator costs and reduce grid dependence. The system would pay for itself in 2.5 years. After that, the owner would have his own generator sitting idle and be free from both grid and generator expenses.\nThe Small Farm's Electricity Crisis\nMustafa recalls a small farm that was paying 300,000 Iraqi dinars (about $200) monthly for electricity. Despite being classified as agricultural use with subsidized rates, this small operation with just basic pumps and minimal equipment was facing crippling electricity costs. With a solar solution requiring about 40 panels and a $300 agricultural inverter (much cheaper than residential), the farmer could recover costs quickly while operating purely during daylight hours.\nThe Battery Placement Nightmare\nMustafa shares how customers often don't plan where to put batteries. One customer said \"just put them in this room\" - which turned out to be a bedroom. Mustafa had to explain that the 2000-watt inverter would make too much noise for sleeping. Another time, someone wanted to install panels on a roof, but a nearby tall building cast shadows making the location completely unsuitable - they had to refuse the job entirely rather than mislead the customer.\nDr. Nasih's Stories\nThe 2019 Training Success Story\nDr. Nasih ran a solar training in 2019 for 30 people. Today, almost all of them are either working in solar companies or have started their own solar businesses. After the training, they stayed connected as a community. Some formed a company together called \"Al-Noor Solar Company\" (The Light). They went from students to business partners, and now when they have questions or problems years later, they still call him for advice. This ongoing relationship benefits everyone - they succeed in business and he maintains valuable industry connections.\nThe Proposal for Extended Industry Placement\nDr. Nasih suggests to Bilal: After the 7-day training, pay for students' daily meal allowances for a month. Approach solar companies saying \"We'll send you 2 students each. You don't pay salaries, we'll cover their daily expenses. They'll learn for a month with you. If they're good, you get a free employee.\" He notes that in his experience, most students get hired permanently this way, as companies see their value after a month of free skilled help.\nHis Personal Energy-Efficient Home\nDr. Nasih mentions his own home as an example - he has excellent insulation on walls and roof, eliminating the need for air conditioning. He lives comfortably with just cooling, no AC needed. This personal experience gives him credibility when teaching about energy efficiency being the first step before solar installation.\n\nInsulation Stories:\n1. The Temperature Bet - Omar Laith (Architect)\nArabic:\nقلتلهم المشروع، قلتلهم يابا عزل حراري، ما اقتنعه، قلتلهم زين، أعطيك أعطيكم شي. أنا راح أتفق مع المكتب اللي راح ينفذ لي العزل الحراري، إذا نزل لي 10 درجات مئوية، فرق ما بين الداخل والخارج تدفعون فلوس، إذا أقل من عشرة ما تدفعون فلوس... واضح ما اشتغلنا. إي أنطينا مجال أسبوع إي لحد ما أخذ، خلينا نقول الكفاءة العالية. فحصناها، نزلنا 17 درجة\nStory: When Omar was trying to convince a skeptical client about thermal insulation 3-4 years ago in Mosul, he made a bold bet. He told them: \"If the insulation reduces the temperature difference between inside and outside by 10 degrees Celsius, you pay. If it's less than 10 degrees, it's free.\" After installation and a week of testing, the temperature dropped by 17 degrees. The client felt like they got double their money's worth - not because it was actually double, but psychologically they felt they had \"beaten\" the contractor. This became a reference case that Omar filmed and used to convince future clients.\n2. The Wedding Invitations - Omar Laith (Architect)\nArabic:\nلأن لأن ببساطة أنا أحب جميع الزبائن، وللمعلومة والاطلاع البارحة إم كنت في عرس لأحد أصحاب البيوت قبل ثلاث سنوات، مكملنا بيتها، البارحة كنت معزوم في عرس ابنه\nStory: Omar measures his success not by immediate profit but by long-term relationships. He was invited to the wedding of a client's son - three years after completing their house. This reflects the Mosul tradition where if you truly help someone with their home, you become part of their extended family. He emphasizes that in Mosul's tight-knit community, reputation spreads quickly, and he knows details about other engineers' work without ever meeting them.\n3. The Oil Heater Transformation - Ghassan (Insulation Contractor)\nArabic:\nيعني عندنا أنا عندي تجربة، مرة اشتغلت بيت. يصرف معدل بالشتاء خلال 34 أشهر، يصرف لها 400 إلى 500 لتر جهاز... بعد ما عتزلنا له، يعني الموسم الثاني، الشتاء اللي بعده إجا قالي والله تقريبا نص القيمة\nStory: Ghassan insulated a large house that was consuming 400-500 liters of heating oil during the 3-4 month winter season. The following winter, the owner called him saying they only used half that amount. At approximately 200 liters saved at $1/liter, they saved about $200 that winter. The insulation cost around $2,400, meaning the payback period was roughly 2 years just from heating savings alone.\n4. The Tale of Two Cities - Ghassan (Insulation Contractor)\nArabic:\nنفس الشخص نفذ مؤ عند بناء بيت أربيل. اتصل بيا؟ قالي استاذ غسان ياريت تيجي تيجي تنفذلي برميل، قلت له ايه؟ فلما رحت لأربيل قال لي قالي البيت كله عسل لي ياه داخل خارج سطح، قلي الر العزل رهيب، طلع قلي بغداد، نحنا الجو عندنا ما ينحمل. قال لي أنا سبات. قال لي أنا عندي ببغداد، استفادت تفصل، قال لي هذا الشيء مستحيل\nStory: The same client built houses in both Baghdad and Erbil. In Baghdad, his air conditioners never stopped running. After experiencing the benefits in Erbil, he called Ghassan desperately wanting full insulation - walls, ceiling, everything. He said it was \"impossible\" to live in Baghdad's heat with constantly running ACs. The contrast between his two houses in different climates made him a true believer. The Erbil house cost $13,000 to fully insulate but transformed his quality of life.\n5. The Second Floor Abandonment - Muthanna Al-Mashhadani & Aya Nizar Basheer\nArabic from Muthanna:\nإحنا بنانا كله تعرف بيوت من عازلة طوابقية وثلاثة يعني 90% من الطابق الثاني، من يجي الصيف ينزل إلى الطابق الأرضي يعوف ويتركها\nArabic from Aya:\nأكثرية الناس هاهاها تستغني عن الطابق الأول، تنزلي الأرضي في سبيل توفر البرودة\nStory: Both engineers confirm that 90% of Mosul families abandon their second floors during summer, essentially losing half their house for months. The upper floors become unbearable ovens. This is such a common phenomenon that it's become normalized - families design their lives around this seasonal migration within their own homes.\n6. The Cooler vs. AC House - Muthanna Al-Mashhadani\nArabic:\nأنا هسه الكهرباء وطنية، أنا ما مشغلة، مشغل وحدة تبريد إللي هي المبردة تعرفها أنت المبردة إي إي ليش؟ المبردات تسحب إثنين إمبير إي. السبليت يسحب 15 أمبير، صح؟ أنا مكتفي بالمباردة، ليش؟ لأنه البيت معزول\nStory: Muthanna lives in a 300m² house but only uses an evaporative cooler (2 amps) instead of AC units (15 amps each). His house is so well insulated that a simple cooler suffices for the entire space. He jokes that while he's having this conversation and sweating from talking, his house temperature is perfectly comfortable with just one cooler for the whole house.\n7. The Free Electricity Mindset - Muthanna Al-Mashhadani\nArabic:\nالمواطن هنا دا يعتبر الكهرباء مجانا. ما دا يعتبرها إنه هذا الشي من الدولة؟... أنا أعرف زوارين يقول أنا ما أدفع ورقة مال، الكهرباء، الكهرباء أصلا مجانا، المفروض تكون أني ما ملزم أن أدفعها\nStory: Muthanna explains the biggest obstacle to selling insulation: many Mosul residents don't pay electricity bills. They accumulate bills for months or years, sometimes selling houses with unpaid utilities. His neighbors openly say \"Electricity should be free, I'm not obligated to pay.\" When he pitches insulation as saving electricity costs, they respond \"What costs? Electricity is free!\" This only changes in areas like Erbil where prepaid electricity cards force conservation awareness.\n8. The Construction Pioneer - Aya Nizar Basheer\nArabic:\nهو من البداية حب إنه شا شاف هاي المادة وشي وجاب الثورة وعمل، وبعدين راسل معمل بال آ بغداد وفر ها المواد... هو أول شي، وجربوا إنه كان حتى كوادر عاملة ما. تشتغله أو تتخوف من العمل عليه\nStory: The owner of Aswaar Al-Mosul construction company discovered ICF (Insulated Concrete Forms) technology and was so convinced he built his own house with it in 2013 as the first test case. Even his workers were afraid to work with this \"foam\" material, thinking it wouldn't be strong enough. He had to train them step by step, paying them well to overcome their fears. Now they've built over 100 houses with this technology, but other construction firms still spread fear about it to protect their market share.\n9. The Sunlight Cure - Omar Laith\nArabic:\nأنا أتحدى بيها على على في مكتبي أني وفي البيوت إللي أنفذها، أقول لهم إذا كان المنور إم أو ال ال ال الكورت مالتك الصغير داخل البيت، إذا كان اتجاهه، فوتلك شمس إنت أوتوماتيكليا صيف شتاء ما صربك إنفلونزا\nStory: Omar makes a bold claim to his clients: if your internal courtyard gets direct sunlight, you won't get the flu - summer or winter. He's tested this with multiple houses he's designed, later asking families to honestly report their illness rates. Those with sun-facing courtyards confirm they get sick less. He uses this health angle to convince clients that green design isn't just about energy - it's about killing airborne viruses naturally.\n10. The Government Building Shame - Omar Laith\nArabic:\nلو تجي تسوي استبيان، لو تجي تسوي استبيان. بعد ال خلينا نقول بعد ال2003 بعد 2003 بعد دخول الأمريكان للعراق اللي اشتغل في كردستان، الغالبية العظمى مهندسين من الموصل\nStory: Omar observes that most Iraqi government buildings are designed only for employees, forcing citizens to wait outside in the sun. There's no consideration for the 100+ daily visitors. This represents a fundamental failure in sustainable, human-centered design. He contrasts this with proper planning that would include 125 seats in air-conditioned waiting areas for 100 expected daily visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture Stories:\nAnfal's Stories\n1. The Kinetic Islamic Screen Innovation\nArabic:\n\"مثلا أنا هسه واضحة الشاشة... اشتغلت على غريس كوفر... هي grassrooper، فهو المشروع متحر من التخرج مالتي كان، إنه أشهر أدرس الأغلبة، المباني اللي تكون منفصلة عن المبنى يعني. يعني بشكل كامل يعني إنه يكون قشرة خارجية للمبنى، وهاي القشرة الخارجية هي إللي تحمي المبنى من طاقة من الشمس... فأنا مثل آ من أعمال آ. وأعطينه ال مثل ما يعني بالضبط موقع البيت إم. وأشقد آ. طابت الشمس إللي تدخل علينا. ممكن يزيد لي مثلا يزيد لي السمك بمكان معينة ك يعني يغطيها أكثر، وممكن تكون مكشوفة من جهة الظل\"\nEnglish Summary: Anfal designed an adaptive building facade for her graduate thesis using Grasshopper - a parametric design tool. The screen acts as a second skin that protects buildings from solar heat. She created a 60x70cm (or 60x40cm) 3D printed prototype with sensors that automatically close sections when strong sunlight hits them and reopen when the sun's intensity decreases. The system works without human intervention. She spent 250 dollars on the prototype using simple materials like cardboard and acrylic, though the sensor system was the expensive part. The design allows customization of traditional Islamic patterns while maintaining functionality.\n2. The Reluctant Clients Who Became Insulation Advocates\nArabic:\n\"بصراحة يعني ما يعني يعني كلش، يعني إذا عندي إحباط بعد ما خلصته، وخاصة إنه أنا يعني اشتغلته حتى ع الجهاز... لا، لا، ما كان للعالم، أنا ما أشتغل يعني بقطاع خاص، يعني أنا أصمم يعني أنفذ بيوت، وهاي يعني. يعني مشتاق العمل متواجدة، أنا، فيعني أكو كل شي يعني زبائن إنه يحتا يحتاجون هاي المواد العازلة، خاصة إذا بيوتهم يعرفون إنه مثل ا تجاه شروق أو يعني دائم ا بيتهم، راح يكون بينه شمس، فيعني يسمحوا لي إنه أستخدم هاي المواد، إنه بالعكس هي مشجعوني أستخدم هاي المواد\"\nEnglish Summary: Despite initial frustration after completing her innovative thesis project, Anfal found that her private sector clients were surprisingly receptive to insulation materials. Clients whose houses face east or receive constant sun actively ask for insulation solutions. They specifically request Thermstone for facades exposed to strong sunlight. Even when clients can't afford everything, they prioritize roof insulation, knowing heat comes primarily from above. She's designed over 50 houses since graduating in 2017, and notes that client attitudes have shifted - what was once resisted is now requested, especially roof insulation which has become standard.\n3. The Interior Garden Revelation\nArabic:\n\"آ، أنا بينا هو نفسه، لكن عملتوا حديقة داخلية بنص البيت، يعني ما عدا إنه بيتنا أصلا ركن، وعندي إضاءة من كل المكان، بس حبيت إنه أدخل يعني حديقة داخلية ببطن البيت. ويعني زرعتوها؟... بصراحة يعني ما تندمت أبد أنه عملتوها، خاصة أنه أنا ما كنت محتاجة الإنارة من هذه المكان... يعني أهل الموصل ما يعجبنا مثل ا نقعد بغى بالحديقة، حتى عندي حديقة خارجية إي وكلش كبيرة غازي، بس يعني مثلا إنه يعني ما نرتاح خاصة إحنا كبنات\"\nEnglish Summary: Anfal implemented a 3x3 meter interior garden in her own corner house, despite already having natural light from all sides. She included a retractable glass roof with drainage system for plants. The space provides privacy for women in Mosul culture who prefer not to sit in external gardens. She created a balcony overlooking the interior garden from the second floor. The design addresses cultural needs - Mosul families, especially women, prefer interior spaces for comfort and privacy. This has influenced her professional work, where she now regularly incorporates interior gardens in her designs, sometimes with fountains at client request.\nWifaq's Stories\n4. The Industrial Insulation Breakthrough\nArabic:\n\"المشكلة إللي كانت بالأوكسيلر المين العفو ال آه المبادئ الحراري ال الرئيسي الإكشنجر؟ أنا بفضل الله دربت شباب فريق عمل، وقدرت إنه أعزل إيه بدرجة 300% من الح... 300% من الحالة التصميمية ثلاثة أضعاف. نعم، ف. ف بعدها ال الأوكزيليري لغى ما احتاجوا رأسا\"\nEnglish Summary: In 2008, Wifaq took on an industrial challenge involving insulation for furnaces and pipelines operating at 900-1000°C. He studied advanced insulation techniques for a reformer system. There was a Jewish expert from Iraq who was the only specialist before him, working under state supervision. Wifaq trained a team and achieved insulation performance at 300% of the design specification - three times better than expected. This success eliminated the need for an auxiliary cooling stage entirely, saving significant costs and energy. This experience taught him the true meaning of energy conservation and its economic impact.\n5. The Secret Plan to Eliminate Street Generators\nArabic:\n\"بعض المهندسين اللي هم حاليا آخر أيامهم بالوظيفة كبار بالعمر، أي نعم هم هذول هم هذا شنو؟ يحاول كل جهده إنه يغير قبل لا يطلع، لأن من يطلع يتوقع إنه ماكو أحد ممكن يحمل الراية إنه ي يعني ي يقضي على هذا الفساد\"\nEnglish Summary: Senior engineers nearing retirement in Mosul's electricity distribution sector are secretly working on sustainable solutions to eliminate street generators. These generators represent a massive corruption file - the crisis is deliberately maintained for profit. These engineers, knowing they have little time left, are trying to implement changes using special meters and fixed amperage systems that ensure basic power even during outages. Wifaq knows these engineers personally and describes them as \"heroes\" trying to fix their city properly before they retire, fearing no one will carry on their anti-corruption mission after they leave.\n6. The Construction Materials Subsidy System\nArabic:\n\"الشركة العامة لي إيه؟ أعتقد الشركة العامة للتجارة... تعطي مواد أولية إنشائية للمنازل الجديدة، أوكي؟ ف آ مثلا أبواب شبابيك حديث تسليح إسمنت. فبضمنها ممكن الدولة تدعم بالألواح الفلين مثلا، أو ألواح ال البولستر، أو عوازل الرطوبة\"\nEnglish Summary: Iraq has a little-known government program through the General Company for Trade that provides subsidized construction materials to citizens with building permits. Currently, it includes doors, windows, steel reinforcement, and cement at subsidized prices. Wifaq proposes adding insulation materials to this list. Citizens can claim these materials based on their building permits and construction progress - foundations first, then walls, then roofing. This system helped encourage construction during the economic embargo and could be leveraged to promote sustainable building. The subsidy is distributed through outlets in each province.\nLaith's Stories\n7. The Trust Economy of Mosul\nArabic:\n\"بالنسبة لأهلي الموصل يحبون أهم شي عدهم الثقة إم، إذا كانوا شخص واثقين من عنده، هذا الشي رح ي يعني دائما يصممون يمه وينصحون أصدقائهم وأقاربهم، بهذا لمن يكون نجح بي فكرة معينة من خلال التنمية المستدامة، الطاقة الشمسية إلى آخره، من هاي الأفكار الحديثة... فهذا الشي يختلف يعني إذا ما واحد مجرب المهندس الفلاني وسمعته حلوة، إي أهل الموصل ما يصمم\"\nEnglish Summary: In Mosul, trust is everything. Unlike other Iraqi cities, Mosul residents won't work with an engineer unless they come highly recommended by someone they trust. Once an engineer gains trust through successful sustainable design implementation, clients become their advocates, recommending them to friends and relatives. But without that initial trusted recommendation, \"people of Mosul won't design with you\" at all. This creates a challenging barrier for new graduates but also means successful sustainable projects can spread rapidly through word-of-mouth in trusted networks.\n8. The Small Plot Innovation Challenge\nArabic:\n\"هسه بهذا الوقت يعرف ال المساحات للمنازل، مو نفس قبل قبل، ممكن 800 م 700 م، هسا الأغلبية ال150 إلى 200 م، واو الناس تقول لك إي يا إما عنده حديقة زغيرونة كلش بره، يا إما أكو فكرة ثانيه إي آ بالليل داخل البيت، إحنا نسوي مناور حتى يدخل إضاءة طبيعية لي البيت\"\nEnglish Summary: Modern Mosul faces a dramatic shift in housing plots - from 700-800 square meters in the past to just 150-200 square meters today. This constraint has sparked innovation: architects now design interior light wells that serve triple duty as natural lighting sources, ventilation paths, and interior gardens. These skylights/gardens become central design elements, strategically placed to serve multiple rooms. Families prefer these interior green spaces over tiny external gardens, as they provide privacy and can include water features. This represents a modern adaptation of traditional Mosul courtyard houses, solving multiple problems with one design element.\n3. The Market Fear Phenomenon\nArabic:\n\"كيفية الدخول في السوق، كيفية؟ كسر حاجز، رهبط، رهبة السوق، ونمطية البناء، يعني اليوم الخريج من يطلع على السوق عنده رهبة يخاف من السوق، كيف يتعامل من السوق؟... أكو أكو حكمة تقول إي أن الخجل يضيع نصف الفرص، فنحن من نريد نقوي جرأة الشخص المقابل حتى نخلي لك يصطاد الفرص بطريقة أسلم وأسرع\"\nEnglish Summary: Ahmed identifies a critical issue: graduates experience genuine fear when entering the job market. They don't know how to interact with the market or break through its patterns. He quotes a wisdom saying \"shyness wastes half the opportunities.\" His training focuses on strengthening graduates' courage and confidence so they can \"hunt opportunities\" more safely and quickly. This addresses not just technical skills but the psychological barriers that prevent talented engineers from succeeding.\n4. The Hidden Job Market Reality\nArabic:\n\"يعني اليوم انتقل لك ماكو شغل بالسوق ما تمام. أقول لك لا، أكو شغل، لكن أكو ناس ما تعرف تشتغل وأكو ناس ما تعرف تسوق لنفسها... أكو ضعف في التوجيه، أكو ضعف في من يتكفل في هذا المشروع وتطويره، أكو ضعف في التسويق\"\nEnglish Summary: Ahmed challenges the common narrative that there are no jobs in Iraq. He insists jobs exist, but identifies three critical weaknesses: people don't know how to work effectively, they don't know how to market themselves, and there's a lack of guidance and mentorship for developing careers. The problem isn't job availability but rather the gap between what employers need and what graduates know how to offer or communicate.\n5. The Talent Scouting Promise\nArabic:\n\"شوف رح أكلك رح أقولك أستاذ بلا شغلة، أي شخص متميز ومبدع، راح أسحبه بلا ما أرجع لكم. بس إذا ما متميز المبدع، رح أحاول أوفر له قدر المستطاع، فرص توظيف مع الأصدقاء والمعارف\"\nEnglish Summary: Ahmed makes a bold commitment about internships from Bilal's program. He promises to directly hire any trainee who proves exceptional and creative - he'll \"pull them\" without asking permission. For those who aren't quite at that level, he commits to leveraging his network of friends and contacts to find them employment opportunities. This demonstrates both his confidence in identifying talent and his extensive professional network built over 16 years.\n6. The Recent University Workshop\nArabic:\n\"آخر تدريب كان هو عن كيفية دمج المهندسين الخريجين حديثي التخرج، كيفية اندماجهم في سوق العمل؟ وكيفية أخذ رصانة تخصصية علمية إم مع معرفة الأسعار، ومتطلبات واحتياجات. القطاع الخاص... كان تقريبا أسبوعين بدعوة وكريمة ناشرها حتى بالإنستغرام، وبصفحتي بدعوة كريمة من كلية جامعة النور\"\nEnglish Summary: Two weeks before the interview, Ahmed delivered a workshop at Al-Noor University College focusing on integrating new engineering graduates into the job market. The training covered gaining professional credibility, understanding market pricing, and meeting private sector requirements. He co-presented with Professor Dr. Saad Al-Taan, the engineering dean who was formerly Iraq's embassy attaché. Ahmed promoted this workshop on Instagram, demonstrating his use of social media for professional development initiatives.\n\nReferences\n\n\n",

Download the clean **Materials** CSV\n\n**[Download the CSV](sandbox:/mnt/data/Training_Materials.csv)**  \n\nThe file contains ≈ 70 records with these columns (all Airtable-friendly):\n\n| Item | Category | Module | Use | Min Qty | Recommended Qty | Supplier | Status |\n\nThe **Module** and **Supplier** columns are already formatted as comma-separated text so you can convert them to *Linked-record* fields when you import.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Recommended Airtable structure (3-module version)\n\n| Table | Purpose | Key fields | Links |\n|-------|---------|------------|-------|\n| **Modules** | One row per module (Solar, Insulation, Architecture) | Name, Short Description, Duration (days), Start Season, Lead Trainers (lookup), Cohort Date | ↔ Contacts (Lead Trainers), ↔ Materials, ↔ Daily Sessions |\n| **Materials** *(CSV above)* | Master equipment & consumables list | Item *(primary)*, Category (single-select), Status (Core / Consumable / Optional / Missing), Min & Rec Qty, Use | ↔ Modules, ↔ Suppliers, ↔ Stations |\n| **Suppliers** | Companies that can provide items or discounts | Company Name, Products/Services, Phone, Address, Notes | ↔ Materials, ↔ Contacts |\n| **Contacts** | Trainers, experts, sales reps, etc. (your existing “Contacts” import) | Name, Role, Org, Phone, Email | ↔ Suppliers, ↔ Modules (via *Lead Trainers*), ↔ Stories |\n| **Stations / Kits** | Breaks a module into work-stations or field kits | Station Name (e.g. “Solar – Station 1”), Module, Location (Training Centre / Roof), Materials (multi-link) | ↔ Modules, ↔ Materials |\n| **Daily Sessions** | The “Learn – Apply – Sell” blocks by day | Module, Day #, Learn Focus, Hands-on Task, Business Exercise | ↔ Modules |\n| **Personas & Stories** | Learner personas and the real-world stories you use in class | Persona name, Background, Challenge, Story, Module | ↔ Modules, ↔ Contacts (story owner) |\n| **Assessments** | Certification criteria & score sheets | Module, Phase (Day 5 / Field Day), Criterion, Pass % | ↔ Modules |\n\n### Why these links help\n\n* **Inventory at a glance** – From a Module record you can roll-up total Min Qty for every material and spot gaps automatically.  \n* **Supplier cheat-sheet** – Click a Material to see which local company supplies it and the contact person.  \n* **Station packing lists** – Group materials by Station so set-up crews know exactly what to pull from storage.  \n* **Session planning** – Trainers open a Daily Session record and see the learning objective, the stories to tell, and the materials already linked.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Next steps after import\n\n1. **Import “Modules”** – Create three rows: *Solar Energy System Design & Installation*, *Thermal Improvement & Insulation*, *Green Architecture & Heritage-Inspired Design*.  \n2. **Import “Materials”** – Choose “Link to another record” → **Modules** for the *Module* column, and “Link to another record” → **Suppliers** for the *Supplier* column.  \n3. **Import your existing “Companies Research” CSV** into **Suppliers** (same for “Contacts”).  \n4. **Create lookup & roll-up fields** in Modules for total cost, missing items, etc.  \n5. Build the optional tables (Stations, Daily Sessions…) as your team has capacity; the structure above will let Airtable’s linked-record magic do the heavy lifting later.\n\nLet me know if you’d like me to pre-populate the Modules table or generate the Stations / Daily Sessions templates as CSVs—you can drop the field names you prefer and I’ll whip them up.",

Goal \nOur work fits into the larger BEIT training ecosystem in BEIT - C-4/5 below \n\n\n\n2. Training Philosophy and Overview - Three Part Standard For All Modules\nTraining objectives:\nLeverage the technical and educational background of our participants\nDevelop practical skills and confidence in assessing, designing/modeling, selling, installing, and overseeing work in green housing (insulation, architecture, solar)\nBuild evidence and increase desirability and inbound marketing for the sustainable housing market\nTo develop the financial literacy skills needed to assess green material/install opportunities and to leverage that knowledge to convert hesitant customers\nTo develop the training competencies of the technical trainers in Mosul to include financial, and soft skills training necessary for sales engineering positions\nTo support trainers and trainees in creating service packages aligned with Iraqi sustainable housing needs that solve a real problem for the residents while also greening the housing market, lowering recurrent costs and associated emissions while also developing new opportunities for youth jobs and potential new businesses \nStart with a framing (15 min): Today’s learning objective, customer story, & goals.\n\nLearn (45-60 min) – Share core knowledge for the day + failure photos,learn from the trainers lived experience in the field, ask, how would you solve….\nApply (hands-on experience) (90 min) – hands-on stations (rotate every 30 min).\nSell (60+ min) - Small group application and practice, dialog, role play, business models, ROI calculations, etc…\nEnd with a reflection & assessment (45 min) - Q/A and streamlined method for assessing progress named sticky-note wall; trainer tweaks next day.\n2. 1 General Strategy for All Modules:\nDay\nLearn\nApply\nSell\n1\nBasic knowledge and principles, technical.\nReal world (personal home?) site selection & assessment\nClient-persona interviews\n2\nShared learning and experiene from the trainer\nSite strategy and plan\nROI modeling and customer pain points\n3\nBest practices from around the world\nModeling\nBusiness Modeling and profitability\n4\nKeeping High Standards, Quality and Safety\nPractical installation work, and overseeing of trades people\nMarket research\n5\nCreativity, problem solving, communication, customer orientation.\nApply in class, get certificate stage 1\nClient problem orientation and empathy\nOptional 6th\nBusiness Model, ROI, Financial Concepts\nApply in a real setting, get certificate stage 2\nConfidence, marketing material, interview skills\n\n\n3. Pedagogical Philosophy:\n70% Hands-on, 30% Theory - Always touch before talk\nProblem-First Learning - Start each day with a real challenge, end with a solution\nContinuous Case Study - One project evolves through the entire module, design and model a project to be applied. Likely to be the participants own family home.\nFeedback Loop - Daily sticky note reflections for assessment and data collection\nMistake-Based Learning - Expert-identified failures drive curriculum content\n\n4. Stakeholder Development & Insights for Curriculum\nExpert Interviews - So far the Solar has the most depth, continuing to interview and develop content for architecture and insulation:\n7 Solar Experts\n7 Architecture Experts\n4 Insulation Experts\nDaily Structure Clarity:\nThematic Knowledge: Solar principles, R values, green home interventions…)\nPractical Knowledge: Develop a case study for your own home / neighbor / family over the course of the entire week. Focus on a case that you may be able to apply something on before the optional day six next week!\nBusiness: \n1. ROI: Learn how to build ROI models and sales engineering techniques\n2. Business Modeling: Investment requirements, possibility profitability, etc  to help people imagining what it might be like to \nExpert consensus on the practical-first approach\nQuantitative Trainer Assessment - Measuring experience levels, installation counts, teaching capacity\nNext: Continue to identify and interview experts and trainers for Modules 2 & 3.\n\n5. Suggestions for Future Implementation\nTo increase real-world impact and strengthen graduate engagement, we propose the following ideas for future rollout:\nBegin Solar Module in early summer to align with rising heat and peak customer demand for cooling solutions.\nCoordinate with 3.2 TVET trainees when graduates begin real-world implementation, encouraging cross-module collaboration.\nReplace “Optional Day 6” with a Design Competition Awards Gathering, including light food and tool-kit prize distribution.\nOffer simple, meaningful graduation gifts, such as engraved screwdrivers or starter tools, to mark the start of their career journey.\n\nI want a aligned intro with a more organized cleaner way to say part 2: \"2. Training Philosophy and Overview - Three Part Standard For All Modules\nTraining objectives:\"",

Why this program exists  \nIraq’s housing market is modernising fast, yet families still battle 49 °C summers, unreliable power and soaring generator costs. BEIT’s three-module program—**Solar Energy**, **Thermal Improvement & Insulation**, and **Green Architecture & Heritage-Inspired Design**—equips young engineers, contractors and entrepreneurs with the complete toolkit to turn those pain-points into practical, profitable solutions:\n\n* **Technical mastery** – from wiring lithium batteries to mixing heritage Labkh plaster.  \n* **Sales engineering** – calculate ROI, build trust, close deals.  \n* **Job creation** – graduates leave with a ready-to-sell service package and supplier discounts.  \n\nBy the end of the journey, participants can **assess**, **design**, **sell**, and **oversee** high-impact green-building projects that cut bills, emissions and customer frustration.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. How we teach: the 3-Block Daily Rhythm  \nEvery training day follows a repeatable loop that balances theory, practice and business:\n\n| Block | Duration | Purpose | Typical Activities |\n|-------|----------|---------|--------------------|\n| **Frame** | 15 min | Set the “why” | Today’s objective, customer story, success metric |\n| **Learn** | 45–60 min | Core concepts | Expert demo, failure photos, mini-quiz |\n| **Apply** | 90 min | Hands-on skill-build | Rotating stations, site walk-throughs |\n| **Sell** | 60 min | Turn skill into value | ROI worksheet, role-play, market research |\n| **Reflect** | 45 min | Close feedback loop | Sticky-note wall, Q&A, next-day tweaks |\n\n---\n\n##### Training objectives (apply to **all three modules**)\n\n1. **Leverage participant know-how** – start from their electrical / civil background, then up-skill.  \n2. **Build evidence & desirability** – learners leave with data, photos and testimonials that attract work.  \n3. **Embed financial literacy** – every tool or material comes with a payback calculation.  \n4. **Grow Mosul’s trainer network** – coaches learn to blend technical, financial and soft-skills content.  \n5. **Launch market-ready services** – graduates package solutions that lower costs *and* emissions while creating youth jobs.\n\n---\n\n##### Five-Day sequence (optional Day 6 field validation)\n\n| Day | Learn → | Apply → | Sell → |\n|-----|---------|---------|--------|\n| **1** | Fundamentals & safety | Real-home audit | Client‐persona interviews |\n| **2** | Expert lived experience | Site strategy & plan | ROI modelling |\n| **3** | Global best practice | Digital modelling | Business-model design |\n| **4** | Quality & standards | Installation & QC | Market research |\n| **5** | Creativity & problem-solving | Capstone build + cert 1 | Empathy-driven pitch |\n| **6** *(optional)* | Business finance deep-dive | Live install + cert 2 | Marketing assets, interviews |\n\n---\n\nThis streamlined intro clearly shows **why** the program matters, **how** each day flows, and **what** participants will achieve—ready for the rest of the document to dive into module specifics.",

السلامة\n\n00:06:03 YAMAMA SALIH\n.ها تمام. لا ما فهمت؟ وحاليا أشتغل إعادة إعمار الواجهة النهرية إللي هي أغلبها بيوت سكنية، إللي اضطرروا نتيجة الحرب إللي الأخيرة إللي صارت على الموصل آ. اللغة ال آه حاليا الصندر خلينا نقول دونز هي الحكومة العراقية\n\n00:06:33 Bilal\n.إي أوكي خوش. إي\n\n00:06:38 YAMAMA SALIH\n.وحاليا. إللي هي أغلبها بيوت سكنية، إي مضطررة نتيجة الحرب إللي الأخيرة إللي صارت عليه الموصل\n\n00:06:49 Bilal\n.آ من دعم منو؟ أ هاي شركة معمارية، آ يونسكو إيكرا منو دا يشتغل على هذا ال\n\n00:06:56 YAMAMA SALIH\n.آ ال حاليا الصاندر، خلي نقول هي الحكومة العراقية كانت الأرصدة المجمدة لمحافظة نينوى خلال فترة 2014 إلى 2018، الفترة إللي ما بعدها يا عمر. فكانت هاي الأرصدة المجمع بس تقديمة بإعادة إعمار المدينة القديمة. الشركة عراقية الشركة للمقاولات، آ مدرائهم المهندسين آ مدني، وأنا مهندسة المعماري\n\n00:07:19 Bilal\nكلش حلو، هذا يعني آ؟ آه يعني يعجبني ال التفكير وطريقة اللي يعني رأسا تخرجتي و دخلتي وفدتي هواية مشاريع كلش لطيفة، آه وواحد من ال ال آه الأشياء اللي بدي أفكر بيها يريدوا يشوف إنت شلون قدرتي وشلون ما زال تقدرين تدخليها بالعمل إنه هي ال هوي من ال ال الأساليب القديمة مال تراث إي بيها فكرة الإستدامة، مو لأنه واحد يريد يكون خضراء ال المؤسسات الدولية يحبون ال الاستدامة. بس لأنه هي بها راحة، آه بيها، يعني هواية أساليب اللي ي يفيد المجتمع، آه ال الخصوصية، آه وال أم حب حب الطبيعة آه ويعني بها بهواية أشياء اللي آه نقدر نتعلم منها، آه بس مو إنه نقلج فواحد من الأفكار، شلون نقدر نجيب هذا؟ الفكرة إنه هو نقدر نتعلم إنه بالماضي ما رح نعرفوا كهرباء قبل ميتين سنة، فلازم يبنوهن بالطريقة هاهاها، فشلون نقدر نتعلم من ع منها حتى أا نجيب الأفكار؟ امم بال بال آ بالواقع وقت حالي بس واحد من المشاكل إللي لاحظتها ب بموصل إنه المهندسين عندهم س شوية صراع مع الناس اللي يحبون تراث، لأنه أصحاب التراث يقولون إي لأ، جيبوا حائط متر كامل والصخر، والمهندسين، اليوم إحنا عنا هذه المادة والفلين يعني شبيها الفلين، آه لو بيرلايت بروليت كلش حلو في يحاولون يشجعون الناس، إذا إستعمال ال الأشياء الحديثة، بس ال آه الناس اللي يحبون التراث يقولون لأ، فواحد من الأشياء اللي يريد يشوف أم يعني ب ب بشغلك، ويجوز شلون نقدر ندخلها بال بالتدريب، شلون نقدر ن نحل هذا ال الصراع، وهذا واحد من الصراعات اللي أشوفها\n\n00:09:09 YAMAMA SALIH\nآ بعد ما تخرجت ست أشهر؟ آ لدرجة إنهم أيدت يعني إنه خلاص هذا المجال اللي أنا دخلت فيه، شنو؟ وضع نيكست؟ يعني ما. ما لقيت أي قصة تناسبني، بس بلغت أتعلم بالبرامج التريدي، خلينا نقول قبلت نفسي بيها أكثر، وبعدها حصلت سلطة شغل، فمن هنا بلشت الرحلة، أما بالنسبة للصراع إللي ذكرتها يعني موضوع الكهرباء ما كان موجود قبل ميتين سنة، بالنسبة للمدينة القديمة إللي أنا لاحظتها، وإللي حاليا اشتغلت أكتر، خلينا نقول باتجاه التصميم الحضري. عدنا البيوت. مساحتها مثلا اطمانين أو 70؟ يعني أكو بيوت 30 م2، يعني بالنسبة إلك آه هاهاها بس كان يعني بطريقة ما كان يعني حتى عدد أفراد البيت أحيانا أربعة أو خمسة، بهاي المساحة، بس كان أكو إشارة على وجود خلينا نقول الفناء أو الحوش إللي إحنا نسميه كورس وحوله تتوزع بقية البضائع، فكان ها الشي يوفر إضاءة تهوية، على الرغم من إنه مدينة الموصل، ولحد فائض عاني من مشكلة الرطوبة. آ ارتفاع منسوب ميه دجلة، وسبب وجود المياه الجوفية، فدائم ا أن نحنا استخدام مادة ال آ الجص، و آ الحجر إللي إحنا بنعميها الجص مادة النورة، بعد ما نبني بالحجر ننطي الجدار آ المر المملكة، يعني ال آم إللي هو ابن نورة بيكون غالي بالنهار أوف واي بيج أبيض على حسب إللي نخليه غالبا تظهر أدنى الرسومة يعني بداخل البيت حتى لو يعني بنينا بطريقة صحيحة بس إم. لأ، بالزيت تقريبا بالثفيه، خاصة إنه إحنا ال السابع والثامن، وشهر السادس جدا، بس بعد ما نبدي فصل خريف آ بالذات أواسط التاسع إلى تقريبا شهر الرابع، إحنا نعاني من مسألة الرضوبة إلى اليوم إللي لحم، حتى خلال شغلي باليو إن أو شغلي بال برايفت سيكتور، مسألة الرطوبة ببيوت الحديثة، ممكن معالجتها أسهل من البيوت القديمة. البيوت القديمة نبني جت الحجر، هي كانت عادية بالأساس، تمام؟\n\n00:11:30 Bilal\n.بس\n\n00:11:31 YAMAMA SALIH\nفي نفس الوقت، إي بس بنفس الوقت أهل هالسوق يعانون من مسألة آ الرطوبة وإللي هي لم تتعالج فيها اليسار حتى بواحد من المشاريع، أنا يعني صيام نوعا ما أنتقدها يعني إنه آ بناء البيوت إللي هي قاعدة بدعوة من الاتحاد الأوروبي، إحنا رجعنا الناس إعادة إعمار للبيوت والناس استفادت منها وسكنت وكذا وكذا، بس إلى اليوم أنا أشوف. وما كأنها ميثهدologies. الرطوبة إيه صحيح من المشاكل اللي يعني أنا أستوي يعني لوك فور زوجان يعني آ وحدة من الشغلات الثانية الأهالي إحنا المدينة القديمة مرشحة إلى إنه تكون آ ضمن قائمة التراث والعافية، لكن للأسف أكو بعض الممارسات إم بعض الممارسات، يعني مثلا إنه آ عندنا وزارة الآثار، وزارة الثقافة، إيه قسم الآثار؟ بنينة مو قوية، كلش إنه تنفي للناس بداعية تجي تطلب على صاحب البيت إنه إنت هذا بيتك تراثي حثري عمره ميتين أو مية سنة ما تتشرف فيه، طيب صح بالبيت إنه الدخل المحدود آ يعني والتعليم ولا يعني يا دوب ممكن يكون ابتدائية أو لأ، ممكن يكون حرافي، بس عموما الدخل العالي الميس ما حلو إنك تشرك البيت ويروح البيت التاني. ف آ شفت كتير يعني من ال آ الدخل، يعني العوجات القديمة خاصة أكو بيوت مبنية على طراز الحديد،\n\n00:13:07 Bilal\n.يعني هدموها بنوما جديد يعني\n\n00:13:10 YAMAMA SALIH\n.بالضبط، أو يتعمدون أهل البيت مثلا، أن يفتحون الماء إلى أنه تخرب أجلاء من البيت تمام، فهنا الآثار ما تقدر تحاججهم بهذا الشي، وهو أص أصلا يوعي يعني هذا البيت وبنفس الوقت السياحة، يعني أنا أشوفها بعد التحرير إللي صار شوية تشجع وصار بالسياحة بالنسبة لمدينة الموصل وخاصة تركيز على المناطق الأثرية والتراثية. بينما إلى حد الآن بالنسبة للناس، كم ك كنفضل دخل قوي من الزرافة والآثار، ما موجود حتى للدولة نفسها، يعني بشكل عام اقتصاديا الدولة، إحنا العراق ما يعتمد أساسا على السياحة والسياحة أو الجراث أو يعني. فا يعني بالنسبة إلي موضوع ال يعني خاصة بالمشروع إللي دا أشتغل علي إعادة في الإعمار إنه يرجعها على الطراز القديم، نرجع نستخدم الجوف والحذر في المواد القديمة، كثير من الناس أعتقد إنه راح نستخدم لأ الكونتري حسب الأساس، الحد ال، لأنه ما ينفع استخدم أساس حجر، وأنا أعرف إنه عندي تربة رخوة، بس ممكن تتأسف. ف آ ما بعدها. ما بعد الأساس، أنا حيكون عندي درس وحجر وكذا، بس استو أساعد إذا راح نعالج مسألكم رطوبة، أو راح نرجع\n\n00:14:31 Bilal\n.بدي أسوي بحوث بال آه ال الشركات، يعني مثل سيكا مسيكا وأكو شركات مختلفة اللي يبيعون هون أشياء، يعني يقولون يعالج الرطوبة، ما أدري شنو إنت مجربة من هذول الأشياء، وشايفة، يعني إذا يشتغلوا ما يشتغل، وبعدها مشكلة ما ما إلها حل\n\n00:14:47 YAMAMA SALIH\n.جربنا إي. جربنا من الشركات من شركة إيطاليا معروفة، بس ما يعتبرني إسمها. بنئذ بال مقذنة، ما عاد منارة حد بعض عندي في بعض المكانات، عندي أبو صوبة، بس إنتي تلغي المياه الجوفية، يعني مهما كانت الطبقات العليا، أوكي تمام الوضع تمام، ما عندي أي مشكلة، المكانات إللي هي خلي نقول السولما المياه الجوفية أعلى بيها. كنت أكره بشكل واضح\n\n00:15:16 Bilal\nمن الأشياء اللي يجوز كان يفيد بالرطوبة هي ال يعني اتجاه الرياح من وين داخلة؟ وين طالعة صح؟ آه و أم ال البيوت، يعني ما نحشي بس البيوت الأثرية، بس هو من البيوت ما أشوف إنه هو عندهم إي يسدون كل شبابيك ويي يشغلون تكييف صح لو يعني شنو حل ال ال الرياح بالبيوت؟ يعني شو نقدر نسوي بفكرة ال الرياح حتى بس يعني مو بس نعالج فكرة الرطوبة بالصيف، الرياح، يعني طلع الحرارة اللي يتكث ر بالطابق الثاني، وبالشتاء نحتاجها للرطوبة، ف هذا الشي، أتوقع إم إذا عندك شايفة حلول يشتغلون بالموصل\n\n00:16:01 YAMAMA SALIH\n.مما بالموصل مارت لأن التوجه كلش بإتجاه القتل نقول نسميه البناء على التربية طابقين مغلقين آ. بالفترة الأخيرة بس ميت عنده 5% توجه إنه انفتاحية، أكو حدائق، بس بنفس الوقت إحنا اقتصاديا محكوم مين بالمزاحات يعني؟ و. ارتفاع أسعار العقار. هسة واحدة من الحلوية، أنا أشوفها مناسبة، إنه طالما أنا الخارج أو الاتجاه أحيانا ما أقدر أتحكم بيه فأقدر أتحكم بال ديزاين الداخلي، ممكن يكون عندي انفتاح نحو الداخل، آ، فكرة الفناء المثقف، فكرة ال آ ال جاردنري آ ممكن إنه تكون موجودة واحدة من الحلول الذي بعد أو استخدم مثلا كاسرات الشمس. وحدة من الحلو إللي ممكن الذكية إللي ممكن، بس أنا بالفصل يمكن شفتها بيت بيتها\n\n00:17:04 Bilal\n.أشياء أكو وايد مواضيع، يعني أحب أفكر وياكي وأشارك يعني، وأتعلم، بس ال ال التدريب راح يكون. حتى ن نساعدهم، يعني يجيبون أفكار جديدة آه ويحققوها ب يعني بناء حقيقية بالموصل إنه مو تكون واحد يقترح فد شي شافه على إنستجرام واحد بعومان سواها وعجبها ويحاول، وما أحد يستقبلها، ف آه واحد من ال الأشياء إم ال اللي أريد أفتهمها شوي، لأنه أكو فرق بين ال ال هي بيت موجودة ينضاف عليها ال همنا، يعني العازل البيت موجودة، ونقدر يعني من ورا بناء البيت سطح شوي صعب، بس نقدر نحط يعني على السطح نقدر نحط. أبيض نقدر نسد الشبابيك بنقدر نبدل الشبابيك، نقدر نحط اللبخ برا لبخ جوة، أكو أكو قرح ونقدر نتحكم بال يسموها ما أعرف الكلمة بالعربية إنه يعني إي عادت تعمير إنه ن نجيب أفكار جديدة ونحطها على البيت\n\n00:18:07 YAMAMA SALIH\n.أو\n\n00:18:09 Bilal\n.بس بالنسبة. يشتغلون وإياهم حتى يحسنون بيوت، لو بس لبناء جدد، إنه أكو\n\n00:18:18 YAMAMA SALIH\n.بناء فقط للميناء، يعني إلى اليوم أنا ما صادفت يعني من زملائي على الأقل آ شخص اشتغل مشروع يعني لأ كله كان آ، مجرد بناء، لأنه يريد ي ي يخلص من المشكلة معينة أو البيت قديم أو تحديث. فا إحنا مشكلة ثانيه إلي أحيانا البيوت المبنية مثلا بال2000 أو بال2002. آه، لأنه. لمجرد إنه صاحب البيت، أدبه إنه ديجاين أو التوجهات الحديثة، يعني فلأ هي بناء لأجل البناء، مو بنا، لأجل تحسين\n\n00:18:57 Bilal\n.زين آ زين ف آ فهي بنا آ من جديد، و آ أكو آ أني سامع فد شي جاي، وأريد أشوف إذا أنت تعرفين أي أي شي عن هذا الموضوع، إنه أكو شركة إيطالية جاية رح يو يوسعون يعني يشتغلون على مال الموصل 7 كم خارج المدينة أي شي عنها، شنو يعني؟ شو وقت جاي؟ شنو؟ ال الأساليب اللي يستعملوها لهذا ال البناء الجديدة، و أكو يعني\n\n00:19:26 YAMAMA SALIH\nفكرة. إذا نحكي عن التخطيط الحضري، أنا اللي أعرف هذا المشروع توقفت يعني. آ إي أعرفه اللي أعرفه توقف ال للأسف سياسيا آ إنه عن مركز مدينة الموصل يتوسعون بشكل، خلي نقول حلقي أو الدائري 7 كم بكل الاتجاهات بسبب إنه. المدينة من ناحية الإمارات، والسكن من ناحية المطاعم، كافيهات، فصار أكلوا نوع من الزخم في الدولة، احتاجت، إنه توفر دول آ مساكن جديدة، آ ف آ كان أكو مثل هاي الخطة. تترحم على نينوى آ ماركت شركة إيطالية أو فرنسية، بس اللي يعرفوه كان في أقلية أو مكون من المكونات يعني لأسباب سياسية، والمشروع المتوفرة. زين خير إن شاء؟\n\n00:20:28 Bilal\n.الله زين، إي لعاد امم راح راح إي أشاركك ال التدريب اللي كان بالي وو آخذ ملاحظات إي إذا يعني إذا أنت يعني تغيريها لو تزيديين عليها تقصريها، آه شو نسوي ف آه خليني أشارك الشاشة مخالف أوكي لحظة واحدة. إي. Window\n\n00:20:58 YAMAMA SALIH\n.اسم\n\n00:21:02 Bilal\nبتشوفين الإشتاء أوكي زين، ف آه رح يكون بس يعني رح زين آه خوش، آه إنتي إنتي أنا\n\n00:21:11 YAMAMA SALIH\nحاضرة التدريبات، بس كم متدريبة وليس مدارتكم يعني؟\n\n00:21:14 Bilal\n.أنت أنت حاضر تدريبات، وأنت يعني معطية تدريبات\n\n00:21:20 YAMAMA SALIH\n.أنا حابة التدريبات بس كمتدربة وليس مداربا\n\n00:21:23 Bilal\n.أوكي، إنه هذا واحد من الأشياء الثانية إللي ندورها، مو بس إنه يعني راح أحاول أرتب التدريب، أم بنفس الوقت أريد أشوف إذا أكو ناس مستعدين يكونون المدربين فورا ما نخلص بالتدريب، يجوز يعني تخيلي يعني إنه هذا هذا شغلة بيها، يعني أجرة، أكيد إنه بيها وقت يعني عندهم. إذا دور الناس اللي يقدرون يساعدونا نظبط التدريب وهم ين يقدمون التدريب، فبقي هذا أبارك لما أنت تفكرين أم يعني إذا أني كنت راح أسوي هذا التدريب شلون أسويها، زين آ ف آ الناس إللي جايين مهندسين دارسين، يعني عندهم خبرة، ما لازم نبدء من الصفر. أو اليوم يبدأ بثلاث أجزاء، ااا دائما، فبالصبح هي ال أم ال ال ال، المادة الرئيسية ال آ، والمعلومة ن نشاركها نص اليوم إنه بها حركة إنه إستوديو إنه راح يشتغلون على شي، وبعدين بآخر اليوم بنسميها هذا الوقت إنه الناس رح يتعلمون يعني مثل واحد يسوي مسرحية وواحد ياخذ وجهة نظر الزبون، وواحد ثاني ياخد وجهة نظر ال رئيس الشركة، وبنحكي ونحاول إن. إن إن إن\n\n00:22:36 YAMAMA SALIH\n.ندرب\n\n00:22:37 Bilal\nعلى يعني إللي يسموها سوف سكيورز يسموها، يعني بوسينيس تراينينج، بس هذول ثلاث أجزاء عمل هو تفاعل إيه والأيام خم الأيام، نبدأ، أولا يعني بكل المشاكل، يعني الناس يعرفوها إنه لم ا بالصيف يصير تقريبا 50 درجة إي حرارة إي شنو المشاكل؟ ونخلي كل واحد يحط كل المشاكل اللي الناس يعانون بيها، بس أنا هسه بدي أفكر إنه لازم همين نحط مشكلة، إنت هسا شجعتيني عليها. رقوبة. يعني أكو مشاكل شتى، صفة شتى، شتاء صيف. أحلى شي مشاكل في المكان زين؟ نعرض المشاكل والناس يحطون كل الأماكن المهندسة يقدر يكون فيها تفاعل فيها، فيعني من الرياح من ال اي اي الإنسولين الحيطان من المواد البناء من فيعني نسوي مثل خريطة المشاكل، وال ال جهات الحلول، فيعني وين نقدر يصير كب واحد مهندس، إش لون نقدر يفكر بالمشاكل لمن دا يحاول يحل المشاكل آه آه لإفادة الشخص هذا واحد من الأشياء اللي بدي أحاول أخليها يكون نركز عليها إنه إحنا مو جايين إنه هو نبيع بناء خضراء، إحنا جايين نحل مشاكل الزبون نخليهم يحسون إنه إحنا وياهم بدنا نفكر وياهم حتى نحل بأحسن طريقة، ما يمكن اللي يعني إي يفيد\n\n00:24:06 YAMAMA SALIH\nآ، إحنا أوكي راح نطرح إنه موضوع، مثلا بالأول راح نحكي عنه الرطوبة أو نحكي مثلا عن بس قبلها ما ذكرنا إنه نكون، يعني ما أعرف إني أنا شخصيا أفضل هذا الشي، إنه يكون مثل ال بالنسبة لل آ إنه أفهم كل شخص يعرفني عن نفسه، وشنو أكثر، يعني شي يحتفل. المواضيع مثلا آ بس بسبب اختلاف الآراء وجهات النظر ممكن إنه فيه نظاف فيه مينيو سينك ف يعني أخليه سواء اليوم. مثلا بس سبب إختلاف الآراء وجهات النظر ممكن ينضف يعني؟\n\n00:24:49 Bilal\n.التدريب اللي فايت تبيها إنه هوايا مرات واحد يفوت تدريب وأحسن شي يطلع من عندها مو بس العلم، بس المجتمع إي، لأن وبعدين بالمستقبل واحد يلقي شغل واحد يجي فرص، واحد عنده سؤال وأكو واتس أب جروب يعني بقوم بتواصل ف إذا ما نخلي هدول ال الأوقات يعني ناس يقدرون يشاركون ووو يعني يتعرفون على العاب واحد كان اليوم، وشلون نقدر نحسن اليوم اللي وراها ااا يكون أفضل، فهذا هذا جدا لطيف، و و وخوش فكرة ف فأول يوم إنه هو المشاكل وال يعني وين ال المشاكل اللي نعاني بيها وال يجوز؟ يعني؟ نفتهم\n\n00:25:41 YAMAMA SALIH\nالأهداف، طبعا التدريب حيكون لي ال المهندسين. صح مهندسين ولا في آ أشخاص يعني؟\n\n00:25:54 Bilal\nبس عنا خمسة أيام فقررنا إنه نبدء ويا ناس عندهم وعلم وو نحاول نطور، اييه نطورهم ب جهة؟\n\n00:26:03 YAMAMA SALIH\nأريد أفهم ال الفئة المستهدفة مهندسين آ؟ بالإداريين؟\n\n00:26:10 Bilal\n.مهندسين\n\n00:26:11 YAMAMA SALIH\n.لنها يعني مثلا العمارة مهندسها في المعمارية لواحد، بعدين الهندسة، مدنية الإباء، هندسة ميكانيك، ينو المستهدف بالظبط ميكاني\n\n00:26:22 Bilal\n.ايه أكثر؟ يشتغلون بالأفس؟ boss stick to copy paste designs out the machine outlet at home a training goal in the نجيب ون مقنعين يعني شلون يحكون ويفتهمون يعني يعبرون عن الأفكار بطريقة مقبلة. يعني واحد متخرج؟ بس ماذا يلقي شغل؟ فشلون يبدء إنه يسوي؟ فخلال التدريب؟ واحد من الأفكار إنه ننطي كل شخص. و50 قدم مربع، ويعني مثل وخلال الأيام، لما يتعلمون المواد يحسنون ويع يعني يزيدون يغيرون ب بداخل الأستوديو، يعني نص ال ال ال ميرالوف ذيي هي إستديو، فأهو علم، وبعدين يطبقون على مال مية، وخم ال رح يكون 150 قدم مربع إي 75,000,000 إي أرض إي يعني. ورثيها، فما رح يزفعون عليها. اسمه أحمد وعنده طفلين وزو، يعني نعطيهم هذا ال ال البرسونة، وبعدين إي ويشتغلون، فالناس اللي. هدول التلاتة اللي نفكر بهم جونيت واحد. ما دا يلقي شغل ونريد يعني. إي. ويلتقلي مع الناس اللي يشتغلون هم أنا بال بال يعني كمعماريين يجوز يعني بخلال هذه العلاقة يصير، وبعدين الناس يعني هم عندهم\n\n00:28:21 YAMAMA SALIH\n.طيب سؤال. تمام، آه عدد ال يعني تمام؟ عدد الأشخاص\n\n00:28:49 Bilal\n.يريدون، يتحولون إلى من؟ معماري إلى. فهذا ال\n\n00:28:56 YAMAMA SALIH\n.طيب سؤال. المجموعة الكلية، المتدربين\n\n00:29:01 Bilal\n.مو يعني. تمام، إذا عندك ناس\n\n00:29:04 YAMAMA SALIH\n.أوكي. ببالي تقسيم يعني مثلا ماري كان يكون يعني. أنا يعني كمعمار وأقترح بس كيف رح تعمل مثلا؟ وإمدادات الكهرباء بطريقة ذكية بدون ما تأثر على الشكل المعماري؟ نهاية هذه أشياء، أنا مثل ا الكهرباء أو الميكانيك لازم يساعدني بيها خاصة إمدادات وزارة الصحة، إمدادات التزويد، إمدادات والتغذية، امم هذه؟ أحتاج مثل ا ميكانيكي أتعاون وياه بدون ما أثر لي على الشكل المعماري النهائي وبنفس الوقت يعطيني. بناء أسد على مثلا العدد، فإذا كان مثلا العدد 20 تحط 40 شخص بعد عشر أشخاص حتى آ يعني من قصر التيم نعرف على أي أساس إحنا لازم نقصر، مو إنه مثلا التلاتة معمانيين حيم\n\n00:29:57 Bilal\n.و تمام أها وعنا خمسة بنفس الوقت، هذا، هذا 0.001 ال. ال الأفكار. لو\n\n00:30:05 YAMAMA SALIH\nيعني أشنجه؟\n\n00:30:06 Bilal\n.من كل تدريب؟ العدد إللي هاي حنسوي راح نسوي ثلاث مرات. وال20\n\n00:30:17 YAMAMA SALIH\nشخص؟\n\n00:30:22 Bilal\n.هذا ال20 يعني أربع أشخاص ويكون أكو آ، أوكي؟ زين. طول التدريب راح ننب، يعني كل يوفز. I have\n\n00:30:42 YAMAMA SALIH\nAn idea؟ حاليا أكثر من موقع تراثي أو أثري بمدينة الموضة. آه ما في مجرد فكرة، آه واحد من اللي بقدر أشارك في اللوكيشنز وياك وأشارك لك صور من موقع الريالتي إي، بس يعني شوية معقد بالموضوع هو بس يعني بما إنه راح يكون طرح أفكار أكثر من كونه يعني رويدان ال آ مثلا تطوير مطار حضري آه عندي مسار آه تقريبا دي كنائس بيوت مسيحيين بيوت مسلمين، جامعة آ، هذا المسار مهدم بالكامل وهو داخل تحت قانون المسار العراقي، ف آ ما أحد يقدر يجي معه يعني إي عدا إنه الملكية الفردية ف ما تقدر تجي يما إذا ما تاخد موافقات، تمام؟ ف إذا كان واحد من المشاريع مثلا الجروب نعطيه تطوير مسار آ جروب تاني يكون مثلا قلنا يعني إذا شفتوا صورة تقريبا بنفس الوقت أنا أحتاج تدعيم هذا ال البرج أ أ أو الأعمال الوريقة للبرج اللي يعني موجود ونفس الوقت ما حواليه بأشطابية، ممكن شلون أحافظ عليها كمثلاند سكيب عشان أصمم عليها، إنه بالنهاية ك عمارة بطبيها لاندس كيد إمبيريور ديزاين آ. يعني ما إنه أفكر على مستوى بنا 150 أو أحلها؟\n\n00:32:13 Bilal\nحقيقية؟ إنه نقدر آه نروح على آه الشركات المعمارية ونسألهم يعني إنتو عندكم أشخاص يريدون بيوت طينا التفاصيل مالتها، ونخليها تكون ح فد شي، حتى لما الواحد يصممها بال بالتدريب، أكو إحتمال يتحقق بالنهاية، فهذا كان الفكرة، بس لم ا إقترحته لل هم عندهم إي فكرة ثانيه إنه يريدوها تكون إي محدودة ك يعني. يعني نلقي فكرة إنه إذا جمعنا كل الناس اللي يريدون يبنون بيوت بالموصل هالأيام. Divide it in half. نلقي هذا الوسط، إنهم يوم قدم مربع، آه يعني طفل يعني يريدون يسوون. Competition يكون أسهل إنه نسوي، يعني نحكم إذا يكون واحد يتقارن بالثاني، عندك نفس ال وكل واحد يعني مسو ىه طريقة ال آه مالتها ف يعني أني حاولت\n\n00:33:16 YAMAMA SALIH\nطيب؟\n\n00:33:16 Bilal\nأجيب أفكار بس هم يشجعونا على هذا آ بنفس الوقت لأنه هم راح يبنون يتوقع خمسة أو 70 بيت بالموصل ويريدون فد شكل مثل اي تيمبلت، يعني هسه أكو تقديد صح؟ شو يصير؟ إذا التقليد اللي إي الجديد يكون فد شي، يعني كل شي يلوق الموصل وكلش يلوق، يعني ال البيت ال ال المتواضع ال مع الموصل. يعني مو شبابيك الغربية وما أدري شنو اللي يكون يبنون فرن بنص المدينة؟ and؟ هو في شي يعني كلش آه يكون يعني مثل آه بعدين وراها إذا يسوون كافي باس ما يخالف سووا كافي الأساس زين، آه فهذا الفكرة ال ال السبب اللي اختارينا إنه يكون يعني بيت أم أن يعني، و آه كل واحد يقدر يقارن إنت سويت شلون، يعني شو شلون اشتغلت على هذا الموضوع بنفس ال ال التحديدات نفس التفاصيل، و آه نقدر نسوي فج مسابقة بين الناس، وال آه ال ال الناس اللي رح يسوون ال يعني رح يكونون من ال معماريين ال المدينة ال وبهالطريقة اللي شان التفكير إنه\n\n00:34:29 YAMAMA SALIH\n.غير\n\n00:34:29 Bilal\n.تفكير. رؤساء الشركات هنانا رح يشوفون ويبدون\n\n00:34:34 YAMAMA SALIH\n.يعني\n\n00:34:37 Bilal\nوجهة نظر جديدة، إنه لأ، هذا مو بس حلو، مو بس يفيد إقتصاديا، بس ال آه الزبون همين رح ي رح يحبها، ف ه هذا كان ال الفكرة والإستراتيجية\n\n00:34:49 YAMAMA SALIH\nإنه آ 75 بيت، سؤالي مين إللي ترحيبني؟ هاي ال75 بيت؟\n\n00:34:59 Bilal\nالشركة؟ ال مشروع بيت هي ثلاث جهات إللي يشتغلون مع بعض، أكو يونسكو. يونسكو، تعرفيها الأيلود international labor، organization. ال آه البيت ال مارو هوم اللي رح تنبني رح تكون بإيدي يونسكو مو 100، 100، لا ت يعني تقولين الناس إنه رح يبنون ب75 بيت، بس يعني آه ما أعرف هذا هذا مو مو بشغلة اليومية، أنا بدي أشتغل عالتدريب، بس أكو هذا الفكرة بدو يشجعوني إنه بالتدريب، شوفي إذا بتقدر تلاقيه أشياء يكون يعني يفيد هذا البناء الجديد إنه نقدر نتعلم بشيء من عندها، ف بس مو كل شي يعني واضح بالنسبة لي منو رح يبنيها؟\n\n00:35:44 YAMAMA SALIH\n.لا، لأنه صراحة يعني. بالمسار اللي حجزتك عنه بالبداية كان على أساس ضمن خطط اليونسكو للبناء، بس للأسف يعني بعدين لأ بالفكرة لأصحابي ما يعني ما كانت موجودة يعني. يعني نسد الموضوع، وخلص حاليا آخر مشاريع الإتحاد الأوروبي هي البارود، خان، أبو موسوحمان، وقلعة وقلعة وأصحابيا، قلعة باصابيا، كلام سكيت مو أكثر يعني. فبهذا يعني انهي\n\n00:36:15 Bilal\n.لأنه م مو بس نباوع على الماضي، نباوع الماضي، نتعلم من عندها ونبني المستقبل ب. ب يعني ب بتفكير عميق اللي وأنا 200 سنة واحد يجي يقول شلون بيت حلو، هاي إن شاء الله\n\n00:36:29 YAMAMA SALIH\n.إن شاء الله، إن شاء الله\n\n00:36:30 Bilal\nزين آ. فهذا ال. أول يوم، هي. بدأنا بال يعني. هذه الفكرة يعني. بعدين نبدا بال courtyard ونحكي على ال أم شلون يعني ال شلون؟ يعني يجي ال آه الرياح، آه شلون ال اللي زرع شو يسوي؟ آه هذا من الناس ال الصمامين ال الآخرين اللي يقولولي يعني، يعني تث 3 م2 كفاية آه وبهواية فوائد فشلون رح نقدر نشارك هدول المعلومات والتفاصيل مالتها وشلون؟ يؤثر بال بالسعر؟ هذا واحد من الأشياء المهمة، آه لأنه يريد القناعة تكون مو بس إنه الزرع، حلو القناعة إنه كلفة البيت يجوز يكون شوية أغلى، بس إي مو بس يرجعلك وراء يعني ثلاث سنين، كل فلوسك، بس البيت رح يكون يعني بيها ترتاح فيها أكثر فترة أطول، ف شلون رح نقدر نلقي أكثر من طرق إنه هو يكون هذا ال ال ألف الأفكار ال ال مال مال وما أدري شنو؟ ي ي يوهى الناس ف هذا الفكرة، إنه نشارك هذا هنانا، وبعدين نسوي مثل أم آه عملي نصممها ب آه ب كارتون آه نستعمل بخور حتى نشوف الرياح شلون يتحركون، آه شلون يصير هذا ال الحركة بداخل البيت، آه وبعدين آه نسوي ال بنهاية اليوم إنه يعني الناس اللي دون الزجاج الكبير إم نأخذ واحد يأخذ يعني وجهة نظره اللي بحاول يقنع المصمم إنه يبنيله بيت أوروبي مدري شنو؟ والثاني إذا حول القناعة على هذا اللي تعلمناه اليوم ويوصل نقاش آه ونشوف وين وين يوصل ونشوف هذه الفكرة، مال آه يعني كيف يطول؟ يرجع فلوس هذا؟\n\n00:38:31 YAMAMA SALIH\nاللي موضوع بالنسبة للموضوع ال إي راح نعتمد على ونعتمد على إنه لأنه كمعماريين إي مثل نسقط وكاد ريجيمات كتاب يعني ال اللي موجودة أو رح نعتمد ال تو دي إلى حد ما نوصل لمرحلة معينة، بعدين نبلش هي\n\n00:38:52 Bilal\n.ه يعني هي رح تكون على أم ال قابلية المدرب، إذا المدرب إللي نخ، يعني إذا أحكي وياه مدربين كل الشطار بسافت وير ويريدون يستعملون ال وشجعهم بيها، آ ف أني أتوقع رح يكون يعني أكثر من الأحيان، وهم قالوا هم رح يبدون ينطونا بالبداية مثل\n\n00:39:12 YAMAMA SALIH\n.آ بالنسبة ل لموضوع بالنسبة لموضوع الديزاين راح نعتمد على ونس ونعتمد على سوفت وير، فإنه لأنه لأنه مثل ما بتعرف يعني مثلا كمعماريين نعتمد أوتوكاد تريديمات. يعني السوفت وير اللي موجودة أو رح نعتمد لل تو دي إلى حد ما نوصل لمرحلة معينة، وبعدين نبلش في الفريدي؟ طيب هاي الحالة لأننا نحتاج. نطلب منهم أنه يجيبون حاسباتهم وياهم، أو إحنا بنوفر حاسبات\n\n00:40:25 Bilal\n.يعني إحنا دا نتخيل الناس إللي دا نعزمهم مهندسين، دا يشتغلون ب آ يعني أها لو خرجين كلية أكو آ أكثرياتهم أكو\n\n00:40:35 YAMAMA SALIH\n.أكيد لابتوبك تمام إن شاء الله\n\n00:40:37 Bilal\n.أكيد، وإذا ما عندهم يعني يجوز نقدر نوفر آ من\n\n00:40:42 YAMAMA SALIH\n.أها، أوكي\n\n00:40:46 Bilal\n.I mean your laptop update، the square near designs بعدين. هذا زراعة أنواع، يعني الحيطان بها. طرق يعني. حجر، وبعدها الدرس الهيئة عن هذه الأشياء. وعن شلون ناس يعني قديما كانوا يبنون، شلون الناس يبنون بالسعودية؟ شلون ناس يبنون بالمكسيك؟ شنو أكو؟ يعني المواد بالسوق بالموصل؟ شنو موجود؟ شنو الكلفة؟ مالتهم فاليو فالويوز نسوي ال آه يعني نشوف كل ال آه التفاصيل مالتها، وبعدين نسوي، فحاول نخلي ناس نقولهم يسوون شوية

يعني، بس آ يعني للناس إللي يفضلون مثلا يحسبون كميات البناء، آ يحسبون آ أحيانا أكو بيه متطور جدا إنه تحسب الأشياء إللي جبت عنها، أو تح تشتغل ليارات مثلا لاير الجمارك لير الإنشائي ليركان هيك ليرة الكهرباء وتجمعهم مع بعض، المشروع كامل في، بس ما أعرف إذا هو من الإحترافية أو لأ، خاصة إنه نحنا بنحكي عن خريجين جدد ممكن على قدر ما إنه تم مشروع التخرج أو المشاريع إللي انطلبت منه خلال دراسته، وخلصت بتخرج أحكي ها الشي، أنا واجهته، يعني لما تخرجت ما كنت محترفة بالماكس أو الأوتوكاب، لأ. بال بتعلم تراكم تراكمين بالممارسة. أو في no، matter we get تشتغل مصاري أكثر، أقوى بالماكس وبالأوتوكاد، مثلا اللوميان سهل نوعا ما، أي شخص ممكن يتعلم\n\n00:51:25 Bilal\n.نطلع أرقام اللي بنقدر نستعملها بقناعة ال قناعة، الزبون، نقول هذا الحياط هيك، وهذا الحياط هيك يا واحد تريد، وهيئة ال ال ال يرويك يعني بالسنة

instagram، يعني الناس حركر لأنه يريد يكون أكثر وقت بين هذا الديجيتال ديزاين، وبين آخر يوم لما رح يسوون ال. لأنه يريدهم يشاركون ال اي الأرقام مال حتى يشجعون إنه صدق، إذا نريد نقنع بالزبون ال المصلاوي الطبيعي، نحتاج نشر، طشت أفكار يعني فكري بيها. 20 شخص كلهم بدو يشاركون يعني مواضيع مختلفة عن بناء الخضراء، بنفس الوقت رح ي الناس ينتبهوا لها رح يصير شوية يعني انتباه يعني يجوز مو ألف شخص بس يجوز يعني مية شخص كم 100 شخص. راح نقدر نشوف إذا نقدر نشارك أشياء حتى ناخذ أفكار نسوي مثل قبل وبعد، يعني بال كل واحد يشارك بوست عالإنستغرام، و تيك توك لو فد شي، ويكون فد شي إنه هذا ال اي ال ال هذا إذا بنيناها على الطريقة التقليدية، وهذول الأرقام، وهذا إذا بناها بنيناها على فكرتي فكرة فريقنا، وكل فريق أكو يعني يشاركوها بنفس الوقت ف أكو احتمال هذا وراء يجوز يعني مبدلين ورا الكوريارد\n\n00:53:17 YAMAMA SALIH\n.ممكن تكون أقرب، أقرب يعني كأشرب الديزاين ستيج تكون أقرب\n\n00:53:26 Bilal\nإذا حطيناها بعد ما عندهم شي متعلميها حتى يغيرون بيها، بس إذا حطيناها قبل ال إننا نحطها ورا الكوريارد، على الأقل إنه هذا واحد من الأشياء اللي بدي أشوفها، إنه كل ش يفيد على البيوت الصغار وعلى البيوت الكبار، نفكر ب أبسط شي، مال هذا ال ال الحديقة الداخلية، لأنه بيها هواية فوائد، آه فد شي إنه نتعلم من التاريخ، و ال الفكرة إنه ي ما ياخذ كل شوي مساحة، بس بيها فائدة كلش كبيرة من نسبة التبريد بنسبة ال آه آه الرطوبة بالنسبة لل أم المرض، بالنسبة الراحة نفسية بالنسبة لهي أشياء بالنسبة للخصوصية إنه يعني أكو إم إي إي الناس يحشولي إنه النسوان بالبيت ما يحبون يقعدون بالحدائق، لأنه ناس يكونوا يخافون يشوفوهم فهنا النسوان يقدرون يكونوا مرتاحين بالبيت، يشربون شاي، يشوفون أشجار في يعني شجرة وحدة على الأقل ف أني أشوف إنه بالنسبة إلي أنا مقتنع هاهاها مستقبل الموصل يحتاج لها حدائق داخلية ولو صغيرة ولو 3 م متر مترين، ما أعرف قد شنو يعني ب ببيوت مية تقدم مربع شنو يسوى، بس، فيجوز نقدر نسويها هيك إم محرك هذا، وهذا ونشوف

الماتيريال و ديجيتال تولز يعني إطلاقا مع بعض، يعني بالنسبة إلي يعني ال خلي قبل مثلا أقول إنه رح أحط الكورتيار، وأكون خليت الديزاين، يعني مثلا أنا عندي 50 م2 فكرت إنه أخلي حديقة داخلية، وأفكر بتوزيع الفضاءات حولها حسب اتجاهات الرياح والشمس، و. وبقية ال العوامل أو بالضبط، و. وأكيد أعامله الخصوصية. بعدها رح أبجي أفكر أنه أريد أشوفها يعني ك ثري دي موديل، حتى أكون تخيلتها بين المرحلة اللي بعدها، رح

وكانوا أفضل البيئة وما أدري شنو، بس هسه هذا فكرة الرطوبة هذا مهم أنو لأ صدق يعني مو رومانسية وكل شي، و. و. يعني كل شي يعني مثل الورد، لأ بها أشياء زينة، وبها أشياء مو زينة لهالسبب أبو تغيير وكل. وكل جيل عندها موادها، وهسا البيئة مالتنا مختلفة. تضيع يعني بالعراق يعني رقم ميتين سنة ما عشان الجو هيك شي مشان الجو مختلف، ف لازم يكون أكو هذا ال ال التوعية لحمة، مو إنه ها رومانسية للتراث أحسن شي، فنروح نتعلم ويكون كلش حلو، إذا نقدر نعرف ال ال ال ال ال الزين والموزين بها يعني ورقة وقلم نسوي، إنت تقدرين يعني إذا إذا قدرنا إم تقدرين تتخيلين إنه هو طريقة نقدر نسوي، في ناس يسوون هذه الملاحظات، لو هي يعني معزولة عن الناس ومغفولة لو\n\n01:13:41 YAMAMA SALIH\n.نو اللي يعني اللي بتسويها مثلا نو اللي يعني اللي بتسويها مثلا مؤسسة الترعة الموصل مع أيوب ممكن إنه يسوي الدولة آ خلال أصدقائه المرشدين السياحيين، خلي نقول ممكن إنه يشرحون غالبتن الأمور، يعني خلي نقول آ حافظين أو فاهمين بارت معين مو مهندسين أساسا، بس يشرحون عن أهمية الهوية الثقافية، الهوية البصرية. الحتبة هي تمثل. يعني الكلام، يعني أنا بالنسبة إلي مستعمل كل الاحترام وتقديري يعني بس مستهلك هو ما. ما كلام، أنا أدرب على أساس المهندسين، وأساس بيتنا سقر آل زكريا، زكريا يعني. نفسو الفكرة يطوي، آه بس يعني صراحة أنا يعني شفتها هي إعلان سياحة أكثر من كونها أنه آه\n\n01:14:35 Bilal\n.يعني من المهندسين ومن المعماريين والإلكترونية مع الناس إللي عندهم آ توعية عن آ عن متنوعة و ما نخليهم يقولوا لنا كل شي، إحنا نباوع، يجوز نأخذ سكتشات، يجوز نأخذ ملاحظات للصور، وبعدين نقول ليش؟ الفائدة معناتها وشنو الشيء السلبي مالتها ف نروح\n\n01:14:59 YAMAMA SALIH\n.معلومات\n\n01:15:00 Bilal\nنسوي ثنتين؟ يعني ما أعرف وين نقدر نروح، ي كل واحد يروح بيته همينا يسوي نفس الشي يروح بيتها، لأنه\n\n01:15:07 YAMAMA SALIH\nممكن يسوي\n\n01:15:09 Bilal\n.نفس ال إنه رح نشوف هذول الأشياء؟ الثاني كلش حار آ بس آ بال بالبيت التراث الرطوبة عالية بال ما أدري شنو؟ وبعدين بهذا أول يوم. يكون أكثر يعني فسحة، إي نطلع إي لو لو يعني نسوي فد شي أبسط، نبقى ب ب بيتراث الموصل نفكر بيها بداخل بيت وراث\n\n01:15:36 YAMAMA SALIH\n.الموصل\n\n01:15:38 Bilal\nيعني حتى إذا نروح نطلع ونرجع عنا بس خمس أيام ما نريد نضيع وقت، فنقدر نسويها، يجي، آه، بس نسوي هذه الملاحظات ونشارك ال الأشياء ال السلبية والأشياء الزينة ب بال\n\n01:15:50 YAMAMA SALIH\n.هي، لأنه أصلا بيت الوث مثلا بيتر داب واحدة من العاصرة، المهم ببيوت التراثية المصلية القديمة، وهو إللي كان الجزء الأكثر رطوبة، فبقية أجزاء البيت آ مثل ا السابقة يعني ال إنه الطابق الأول عدنا السطح. بعدنا يعني كثير من العناصر خلينا نقول المعمارية للعمارة المصرية موجودة في بيت التراث، يمكن\n\n01:16:15 Bilal\n.جهاز. بسيطة أجهزة أنه ي ي يعني يكون يحس ال الدر درجة الحرارة، الرطوبة، الرياح إذا تتحرك لو لأ، يعني أكو جهاز بيها هذول الأجهزة، ونقدر نشوف بيت تراث الموصل، بس الفكرة\n\n01:16:30 YAMAMA SALIH\nإنه هو. التوجيه بيت التراث آ ينسي إنه هو موجه يعني. اتجاهه شمالي مو متأكدة، فالاتجاه الشمالي يكون بارد شتاء صيفا. أنا رحت بصراحة كده مرة فانتبهت. راحت لشتى صيفا بالشتاء يكون فارغ جدا يعني خاصة بالنسبة للفعاليات اللي بره إنه ممكن إنه تصير ب يعني الأيام ال آ، خلي نقول آ لازم آ، وأيام الحر، يعني الإفنتات لازم تبلش ما بعد الستة. لأنه إلى حد الخمسة إنسانية، إنه تكون أكو إيفنتات يعني سيئة جدا. بسبب حرارة الجوف، حرارة الجو يعني هو بارد صيفا يعني بارد شتاء، صيفا أم لطيف؟\n\n01:17:24 Bilal\n.يعني الناس يقولون بيت ال ال يعني مبنية على أساليب التراث، لازم يكون يعني أفضل بالنسبة للراحة، بس ليش هذا حار بها القد، وبعدين يقول هي مو بس ال المواد هي الاتجاه، يعني هواية الخاصين، ف هذا راح يكون فشل، لطيف إنه. نعرف كل التفاصيل، يعني هم. يعني مهندسين أني ما أعرفه أنتو تعرفوها، يعني معماريين مهندسين، بس الفكرة إنه نستعمل جروب كلكتيف إينتيلجنس، يعني العلم ال المجتمع كله، حتى نفسر كل هذول الأشياء، و نبدأ من هناك ما ن ما نفكر الرومانسية عن التاريخ، ولا نفكر رومانسية عن العلوم، البحوث وال المواد الكيماوية، ومدري شنو نلقي ال الشي المتواضع. و ن الطريقة اللي رح نقدر نسوي القرار لم ا نبدي نحب الزبون، نحب نفيده، نحب نكون يعني هذا رح يكون فد شي اللي بدي أحاول أساعدك وأفكر وياه، شلون نحل مشاكل، واحد يحاول يبني بيت الموصل يعيش بيها حلو زوجته مرتاحة، هو مرتاح، آه ما يدفع حواي على النفط، آه فلما واحد عنده هدف البرقية يقدر ينحل ما يقول، ها أني أحب شباك كبير أني أحب ال ال آه الصخر، الحيطان، الجدران الصخر على بي على التراث، لأ هذا مو مهم، المهم الزبون وشلون نقدر نفيده، فهذا إذا واحد يسوي من محبة ومن علاقة زينة أول ا هو رح يستفاد، لأنه هو راح يسوي الشغل، زين شغل بإحسان يكون متى صالحة، و آه بالنهاية آه سمعتها رح يزيد، فإذا يفكر ماديا لو يفكر معنويا ويفكر دينيا هذا الصح، ويكون الطريقة اللي يكون أسهل، طريقة واحد يختار لما واحد ما عنده آه هدف ما عنده بالإنجليزي، قدوة\n\n01:19:11 YAMAMA SALIH\n.قدوة، قدوة، قدوة\n\n01:19:14 Bilal\nيعجبني. بس هذا ما يعجبني. ف يكون صعب يقرر. بس لما يكون قدوة. وبعدين بآخر يوم يشوف يضر قدوة فاد. لو لأفتهمت الزبون فوق تعرف المشاكل إللي يعاني بيها فوق، تقدر ترويه الأشياء، هذا الشي الصعب إنه أكو أشياء، ناس ما يعرفون إنه هم اللي يعانون من عندها إنه إحتمال ما عايشين مكان بيها، هواء نظيف، ما مجتمين هواء. خبر بحياتهم. فشلون رح يعرفون؟ هاهاها شوية توعية شوية علم وشوية يعني آه إعطاء و آه آه فهم حتى مو بس إنه آه يعني واحد يقول لا أني أني مثل ما تزيد تقولين واحد قاعد بيت ب آ بيت تراث قديم مليان مي داخل الموصل القديمة، وما يريد يطلع ويبنى شي جديد، يجوز ما بتعلم هوايا، يعني بيعاني من هواية مشاكل، بس ما بدو يشوفهم، فهذا واحد من الأشياء شلون اللي دخلها بالتدريب؟ فهذه يحتاج بالإنجليزي اسمها. علم نفسي مو يعني الواحد يكون سيكولوجي يعني، بس يعني بطريقة لطيفة وفهم، والقدوة هي المحبة، المحبة وال إستفادة البشر، فإن شاء الله إي لما يكون عنا هاي بقية التدريب يكون سهل، يلا آه خالد وياكم، يلا مع السلامة، شكر ا يا ماما شكر ا على كل\n\n01:20:38 YAMAMA SALIH\nيا أهلا وسهلا، شكر ا بلال.

      "content": "The file contents provided above are truncated/partial snippets. The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on.",
