New chat\nCan you review all our previous conversations and then ask me 5 questions to help me pick the best question from this list to write as my essay for my Cambridge Muslim college Islam and psychology course? Design a holistic healing centre in your local community using learnings from the maristan model of care.\nKashif\n3\nModule 1: Component 1\nQuestion 2\nCompare a therapeutic modality that was developed by a historical scholar of Ilm ul-nafs to a modern-day equivalent of that therapeutic modality today.\n4\nModule 1: Component 2\nQuestion 1\nPropose a model to explain and critically analyse the key theological concepts in understanding the nature of the human soul (rūh).\n5\nModule 1: Component 2\nQuestion 2\nHow do you present and apply the spiritual-ethical model(s) for perfecting and purifying the soul in its pursuit of happiness to a modern community?\nMahdiyah\n6\nModule 1: Component 2\nQuestion 3\nCompare and critically analyse the main differences between traditional Islamic models of the soul and contemporary models of the psyche.\nElham\n7\nModule 1: Component 3\nQuestion 1\nUsing either a real or a hypothetical case: apply the Hikma Model that you explored in this course and apply its framework to the case, discussing assessment, diagnosis, and ‘treatment’.\niman\nHannane\n8\nModule 1: Component 3\nQuestion 2\nHow do you see yourself applying what you have learned of holistic Hikma Medicine in your own practice/vocation/community service?\nHibah\n9\nShow less\n\nRetrieving prior conversations to contextualize essay selection.\nI'll review our previous conversations to understand your context and interests better.\n\n4 steps\n\nRelevant chats\n3 results\n\n\n\n\nSynthesized Bilal's background to formulate targeted selection questions.\n16s\nBased on reviewing our conversations about your presilience work in Gaza and Lebanon, your maristan research, and your broader interests in teleology and tawhidic healing—here are five questions to help you choose:\n1. Evidence vs. Speculation Balance\nYou have rich field data from Gaza and Lebanon (PTG research, character strengths, classroom protocols). Which questions would let you build directly on that empirical base versus which would require you to construct largely theoretical arguments? And honestly—given your research instincts, which pulls at you more right now?\n2. The Practitioner Problem\nQuestions 1, 7, and 8 explicitly ask about application in your practice/community. But you're transitioning out of stable UN work and actively developing Cursive while seeking funding. Which question would actually serve a project you're already building (or could feed into Wellbeing Project, Cursive, or future consulting) versus which is purely academic exercise?\n3. The Maristan Tension\nYou've done deep work on maristans as embodied tawhid—architecture as cosmology. But Question 1 asks you to design a healing center for your local community (Lille? Baghdad?). Here's the hard question: Would you actually propose rebuilding something maristan-like, or would that be nostalgia? What would a healing center look like that takes maristan principles (akhlaq of practitioners, music therapy, waqf funding, fitrah-alignment) but doesn't just cosplay the Ottoman era?\n4. Your Theoretical Itch\nQuestions 3, 4, and 5 are more conceptual—models of rūh, soul purification, comparing Islamic/Western frameworks. You mentioned being interested in teleology (\"we're not here to live forever\") and how that shifts everything. But you also get impatient with pure theory—you want things that work. Which of these conceptual questions would let you scratch a theoretical itch while staying grounded in your Gaza/Lebanon experience? Or would they all feel like intellectual gymnastics?\n5. The Honest \"So What?\" Test\nImagine finishing each essay. Which one leaves you with something you'd actually want to share beyond the course—whether that's a framework for Wellbeing Project, content for Cursive, a model you'd pitch to funders, or a piece that clarifies your own thinking enough to shift your work? Which one makes you think \"oh, this could matter\"?\nYour turn. Answer these and I'll spot the patterns with you.\nEvidence versus speculation. So I have all of this experience empirical. Yeah. Wait a second. Which question let you build on the empirical base? I'm not sure. So the first two are about, The, You know, the the history of the matter stands And it was kinda interesting because they also went through all of these different practitioners but I'm not actually sure exactly Yeah. Each of them let me see. Therapeutic model developed by historical All there? Running enough to modern day equivalent. I don't think so. Critically analyze the theological concepts. That could be interesting. I can imagine theoretically figuring out, like, okay. So why does fight flight freeze or laugh work? What exactly is post traumatic growth in a Muslim, lens and perspective. How does it connect to the data that I've collected on values and action characters profile. Maybe we can try to connect the values and action care profile. To some of these stations and Yeah. Maybe we can get the data from, research from Christopher Peterson, figure out all the people that they researched, and try to map them out. And even wonder, like, Could non Muslims be on stations and states, on and ahual. Question, module 1, component 2. Main difference between traditional aesthetic models of the sole and contemporary models of the psyche. I guess I could also squeeze it into there. Hypothetical, theoretical. It's practical. But it would be, like, for an individual. Although, I could stretch it to make it for, like, a organization or a community or even a city, but that would be a stretch. How do I see implying this holistically? It's such a broad question. It's like, okay. What did you learn? How did you how do you wanna do it? And maybe I should give you some of the content too. That might help. But for now yeah. And the first question, I can answer the second question. Technician problem, 178. Transitioning out of stable work and actively developing, while seeking funding through Yeah. So I could either serve a project that I'm already building, cursive is a question about, like, technology and sort of, like, what is what like, why is technology always burned us? I think a part of it is because it's always been about going faster, And I'm wondering You know, like, the Amish went faster with the the apple peeler technology, but they liked that. It actually helped them serve their values. And so maybe I wonder if there's, a technology framework, right, like design thinking that we could develop based on some of what I'm learning in this psychology, program. That could be kinda interesting. Then your next question is, might as well intention Embodied Tawhid. Architecture is cosmology. Yeah. So what is it? Yeah. I don't really think I'm gonna do the the designing my own matterstand question. Like, unless it's a virtual. Like, what does it mean to have a Madison? Right now, I'm in between places. Although, I am considering moving to Spain to be a part of and the community space there, that's working on, like, permafrost projects, And, the reasoning for that is, like, just want to be a part of a community again and to be a part of things and contribute and to give and to connect and to share. And maybe if I came, with a project, they're starting a place called the Lafonda, which is about arts and they want it to be a place where the Spanish community can meet with the local community So maybe there's something there, but it's not like a healing center. It's a art space, and it's not wouldn't be my space. It'd be my contribution, maybe I could actually, like, look into how to contribute, in this way. And, yeah, that would be cool. And then the next question, my theoretical itch. Roar. Soul purification. Islamic and Western frameworks. I I think it it would be really interesting for me to, like, explore something like that. Like, especially if it's about like, what what happened? Like, what happened with the Western framework? That made people think, like, oh, hey. Let's build a tool to help people make friends. And then it turns into Facebook and then Instagram. And then, you know, like, whatever is happening now with, like, the online technology and world. And, like, people are, like, so excited. About AI and also so freaked out at the same time, but they can't help themselves. And then also they're like, oh, we should really slow down on this AI stuff. Because it could get really bad. And then at the same time, they're like, no. But we can't slow down because China won't slow down. And, you know, in the Quran today, I was reading There's a ayah in sources that says, we, basically pit people against each other, because if there was just, like, 1 purse 1 thing. 1 country always in the lead. There would be fitna on the Earth. Right? There would be, like, corruption. And the question is, like, why? And is that why it's important to have, like, some people rising, some people falling? Etcetera. And, yeah, I think that's some of the thoughts that I have about that. And but, yeah, I do like this idea of, like, I've been trying to write this whole better economics book, and it turned into this realization of, like, oh, wait a second. It's not about economics. It's about cosmology and ontology. It's about, like, what people think of as real and what counts and what matters and And when we have a different, world, we can be, like, talking to each other, but talking past each other. And not really seeing each other. And, there's this idea that, like, the truth is very flexible. Right? That there's not a, Lot of real Solidity to things that is all nothing that's good or bad, but thinking makes it so. And it's like a core part, I think, of people's worldviews that, you know, I just had a friend went to a cacao ceremony and, like, this art ritual thing, and music, meditation. And she said she, like, transported herself became music, lost her individuated sense of self. And then she got back, and she was saying, like, the ground of being is love, and this love accepts and holds all things. And I kinda, like, pressed her on it because she doesn't actually believe in Got She believes maybe in this, like, common consciousness or something. I'm not exactly sure. What she how she interpreted that experience because at the end of it, it's like, is that experience going to Like, if love can hold all things, what it can also hold is evil. And that means evil is not evil. That means that it just accepts it. You know? And it's very Buddhist, and I think that's, like, the idea. It's like, watch things decompose and decay and things rise and fall and yeah, I I I get it. Like, I I've heard people say, like, somehow, compassion arises from this. And that we must make things good or something. But like, why what is good? In a in a Buddhist godless conception, So is good? And, yeah, that's something that I'd actually like to do is to debate this. And I'm getting fired up about it. Just thinking about it because I think here's where my energy is. My energy is, like, asking this question about Like, worldview and what's happening in the west, and I don't even think it's a clear thing. I don't think it's, like, the west says, okay. Well, everything is subjective and postmodern. And blurry, and there are no boundaries. So do whatever you want as long as you don't, you know, step on other people's toes for agency, and that's what goodness is. Goodness is increasing agency for most people and all people, and increasing lifespan to like, continue with experimentation, and experimentation and exploration is the most important thing. Let's go to the ends of the universe. Right? And I don't think it's that clear. I think maybe it's clear for some people, but most people, I think, are just distracted with TikTok and concerns of the economy and money and You know, and not slowing down in the rat race and freaking out. And so so what? Yeah. Like, I think proving that the heart exists as a way as a thing that has the ability to perceive and to know, and to kind of like understand the Western philosophical constructs that lead us to our current worldview and why it happened like I think that’s maybe one thing it’s like there’s I think Charles Taylor does it right you like looks into what’s happening in the world and then tries to understand like why this philosophy why that and I think Alistair McIntyre as well and maybe I should dig deep into that and just say well this is why we got here but it’s not true. It’s a mirror of what’s happening to people when they close off and they’re afraid and they shut down and they don’t accept new information or ideas and it’s very similar to what happened to society and instead of talking about goodness, it’s just talking about possibility because when you can’t say this is good and this is bad. The best thing to do is to keep the infinite game going that is like a philosophical stance and I love the idea of the infinite game but the infinite game isn’t real. There’s the death of the universe if you’re not religious and if you are religious God promises that will all be rolled up and that there is a purpose. There is a good and there is a bad yeah, so this feels really empowering to me and is also connected to my life framework right like it’s connected to this idea of like this thing can be what brings us to understanding Joe Edelman‘s constitutive attention, policies, and understanding where and why we were drawn to things right what is our attention? Why do we all see so such beauty and virtuous people no matter their tradition, you know, people respect them. I think it’s because they’re touching the thing that generates all traditions that there’s one truth and that one truth has a purpose which is God‘s mercy develops all things and that he has an orientation of friendship WALLYA and that Abraham was his friend and that Mohamad is the one he loves and that God doesn’t want to hurt us with death and that he doesn’t do things to hurt us, but he does things that bring us back and I remember I had this vision of a person asleep and something terrible is happening and they need to wake the person up to get them out of the burning house and so they shake them at first, but as the fire grows in intensity, they shake them harder and harder, and this is God‘s promise in the Quran that he will try us and shake us to the point where we ask what the hell when will he open this end salvation and that’s when God promises that it’s near and I connect this to my friends experience yeah sure there is love and one and it holds everything including evil and the thing is God says, even God says in the Hadi that he doesn’t hesitate for anything as much as he hesitates, taking the life of a leaving servant who is his friend because he knows that they hate it and I think that it is here we can even dig into the acknowledged experiences of people choosing to let their own souls go like the people in the Buddhist tradition who have let their souls go so that the Chinese soldiers don’t take on the negative karma and consequences of taking their lives and the many saints and people from the Buddhist tradition with the Zeyn death poems when they discuss their end of life and they gather their disciples and this is when this fearlessness comes through and this fearlessness I think it’s related to all virtue. You know people say that patience is the mother of all virtue, but I think at a deeper level it’s fearlessness and we see what fearlessness and brazen risk taking does in the world of business with the people that have beliefs bigger than themselves and this whole magic of thinking big idea and I think that with new culture, a new understanding of how things happen and why things happen and meaning and purpose and connecting to all of this I think that the Wet can reintegrate and I think it’s important to know that this idea of the west versus the east or all of these things is not just set in stone that it’s a conversation and that we do not just like God doesn’t want to take our souls because he hates to cause us pain. Well he loves all of humanity, but he does not love their actions and especially when those actions are evil and those evil actions we hurt ourselves that’s what God says is that those that oppress themselves do not despair from the mercy of God and so I would say that to the ““Wet and if we think about it, it’s totally I think right like we can totally imagine not wanting the end of times to come because it’s so devastating so many people will be hurt and we need to take for our example as Muslims the prophet himself, Mohammed, Salah, Ali Slim, the prophet who praise for everyone, and of course, this story of the biggest hypocrite who had hurt the profit and the Muslim so much and then when he was dying, he was his son asked the prophet after his death to pray for him the prophet prayed for him and he prayed for him so much that God had to stop him and say listen. This person is done and he did his thing the way he did I cannot forgive him out of my character. This is this. These are the hudude of God right the boundaries I think there’s something really interesting about the boundaries of God and God telling us that his mercy was written overall things, and that these are rules that he has set for himself and then also set for all of humanity that actions have consequences until you totally believe and you let go of your free will entirely and then miracles don’t happen for you and you should stay hidden because it is disrespectful to open the veil that God has decided to keep closed out of a mercy everything God does is a mercy so if God kept failed things and keep them hidden so if God tells you that the sun follows the moon and the moon follows the sun in orbits. There can be a moment where you split the moon in half a sign demonstrate your prophecy but this is to bring you and others into Will to bring you and others into the friendship of the divine because in that friendship, there is no miracles you are just witnessing God was capable of all things doing what God is capable of doing and it reminds me of the story of somebody who came to a Saint and ask them to change what God has written and the first person they go to says how dare I this is the most beautiful thing and then from the first quote that reminds me that everything is beautiful and nothing hurt the quote from Van, Kurt Barnegat, and I’m thinking about that because that is what they say. People will say looking back right and our bodies will say why did you do this? We must be punished and punishment and Teke very similar to this idea of purification. We accrue croft onto our hearts, dragons, and promises that it must be cleaned for heaven. It is a place of purity witnessing and I find it so interesting that in the recommendation for how we should be attending to the call of prayer then the ATHAN, we are asked to repeat and witness that there’s no God, but God and we are asked to repeat and witness Muhammed we are asked to God is great when it comes to the actions we are told to say there is no power or strength except with God so we can’t come to prayer and we can’t come to success. We can only observe that this is teaching us and the question is how do we connect this perspective to the western tradition and I’d say the western Buddhist tradition if we want to think in the language of early adopters we need to find the peoplethat are going to come first and create the momentum and the movement, and those people are likely to be the westerners and the Buddhist, who are connecting to the western movements and the yoginis and the yogis and the people connecting to the Paleo traditions which I believe are not just dietary, but are also connected to the movements of people looking for origins the origins of things the people that are looking for indigenous things there belonging I think the nation state does not offering and replaced belonging togetherness goodness with success and drew many people from all over the world to places where it was missing and maybe this is sort of like in Permaculture where there’s a fire and there’s nothing it’s just stripped there and then you need to get the first pillars there’s a word for it. I wish I knew maybe you can tell me of trees that come and established the conditions for the others and maybe this is what’s happening with all of this Ayawaska and indigenous connections, and even the far right wing people are looking for who are we? Really they believe that there is a Hani and the other side on the far left believes that there is a nothingness and I think connecting both the verses in the Quran, the one that says that God hits different communities against each other to make corruption disappear, and that corruption is on the lands, not from God, but from our own hands doing and then the idea that God will find people who he loves and who loves him and that God will replace of people if they aren’t upholding things and we’re here to learn and to grow from each other, I think adding all of these different or versus together could be a really interesting so much about self and the soul and the psyche, and I think that there is a soul of the world, we can be thinking about it because that’s the thing that we see you know and I think there’s these analogies of the Tezkiyatul nags like a purification of the heart and removing the corruption and how this stuff turns into sickness and decay and disease and that is actually less about adding more about taking away, and I think that the thing that we might need to take away can be related to in intergenerational traumas meeting all the way back too many of the things that the philosophers and the sensitive people had to contend with, which is the reality of religious wars the reality of the black plague and I really want to understand the Romans and what was happening there and what we can say about that in a clear way about oppression slaves and history of beurocracy   — this f might be my big thing.\nShow less\n\nChanneled sprawling philosophical energy into focused essay structure.\n13s\nOkay, I can feel the energy coming off this—you're onto something real. But let me be direct: you just described a book project, not a Cambridge essay. The fire is good. The sprawl will kill you.\nHere's what I'm hearing at the core:\nYour actual thesis: Contemporary Western psychology lost access to what Islamic tradition calls the qalb (heart as perceptual organ), not through malice but through philosophical moves that were themselves trauma responses—the closing-off after religious wars, plague, and the failures of metaphysics. This isn't just abstract theory; it shows up empirically in how people frame healing (symptom management vs. telos), ethics (agency-maximization vs. virtue), and even technology design (optimization vs. service to values).\nThat's Question 6 with some Question 4 mixed in. But you're trying to do too much. Let me ask you five focusing questions:\n1. The Empirical Anchor\nYou have PTG data, character strengths research, Gaza classroom work. If you write Question 6 (comparing Islamic/Western models of psyche), would you actually use that data or just reference it in passing? Because if it's just decoration, that's a waste. Could you structure the essay to show how the frameworks produce different interventions—and then point to Gaza/Lebanon as evidence?\n2. The \"West\" Problem\nYou keep saying \"the West\" but then acknowledging it's not monolithic (some are Buddhist-adjacent, some are tech-optimizers, some are TikTok-distracted). Here's my pushback: Charles Taylor and Alasdair MacIntyre already did the genealogical work you're describing. Are you planning to build on their diagnosis (secularization, loss of teleology, the buffered self) or are you trying to redo it? Because one is a Cambridge essay, the other is a PhD.\n3. The Buddhism Tension\nYou're fired up about your friend's cacao ceremony and the \"love holds everything including evil\" problem. That's a real critique. But here's the question: Is Buddhism actually representative of \"contemporary models of the psyche\" in the way the prompt means? Or is that a side quest? Because CBT, psychoanalysis, neuroscience, positive psychology—those are also \"contemporary models\" and they're not Buddhist. Would your essay be stronger focusing on secular psychology's metaphysical assumptions rather than Buddhist metaphysics?\n4. The Tractable Claim\nYou're gesturing at something about technology, economics, worldview, intergenerational trauma, Roman bureaucracy, the Black Plague... Bilal. Stop. What is the one claim you could actually defend in 3000-4000 words? My candidate: \"Islamic psychology preserves access to a perceptual faculty (qalb) that contemporary Western psychology has methodologically excluded, and this exclusion produces therapeutic approaches that can manage symptoms but cannot orient toward telos.\" Can you defend that? Do you even agree with it?\n5. The Honest Test\nYou said this feels \"empowering\" and \"connected to my life framework.\" But here's the hard question: After writing this, do you want to publish it beyond the course? Turn it into a talk? Use it for Cursive's philosophical grounding? Or is this intellectual sparring that feels good but won't actually change your work? Because if it's the latter, maybe you should write Question 7 or 8 instead—something that directly serves a project you're building.\nNow tell me:\nWhich question are you actually writing? (I think it's Question 6, but with heavy Question 4 influence)\nWhat's the essay not about? (Name three tangents you'll cut)\nWhat's the one empirical example from your work that you'll use as a through-line?\nOkay. Good points. Let's review here. So how it currently shows up. Yeah. That's my thesis. Question 6 is on question 4. I'm trying to do too much focusing questions. Comparing this on the western border, Yeah. I don't actually think it would. Maybe you could fit with my, PCG work, I could bring in the work and the data from, my previous projects, which would be nice. It would be nice to have some anything to do with that content. It's just been sitting there So I like that idea. Decorations, waste. Okay. Yeah. Structure as a show how the frameworks for this different interventions. Yeah. That's interesting. Maybe it could Connect with the come alive, or am I trying to do too much with that and just put everything on it I think I have this, what's this fallacy or this bias And it's the it's like a biased person, monious things. Like, I want to find the one thing that if we address addresses all things. And I don't think that's actually really the case because I guess it it is sort of, and that there is the one thing, but then there's also multiplicity. Right? Like, there is a 100 stations on the path. And then there are stations and then also there are states. And so these things kind of bounce back and forth So and that it serves a a purpose. Right? Like, oneness just is. Right? There's no towards. It just is. And so maybe the the idea of the trinity and, like, the three things is is valuable because sure. There's, like, one down the the middle, but then there's the pull. Right? Right? The the the parallel tension, the between this way and that way that, you can use to sort of walk. Like, yeah. It's interesting that maybe there's a parallel in the human body. Right? And this, idea that the the prophet loves odd numbers. Right? So you you go back and you go forward And because of that, you go forward. So there the oneness is the towards, is the forward but, like, you need the 2 legs and you need to kind of like, wobble almost, to move anywhere. Wes' problem. It's not monolithic. Yeah. Sure. Tech obsessed. TikTok distracted. Charles Taylor. Yeah. They did the work. Secularization, loss of teleology, the buffer itself. Yeah. I wanna build on their work. And maybe there's a not western philosopher that did this, although it's good to actually have the western philosophers who else, in this, world view might be someone that I could reference. And then who, might be in, I don't know, like, a critique a A person from maybe an indigenous culture or, eastern, researcher trainees even. Writing in Chinese. I'm not sure. Are there anybody? Out there that wrote something about this, loss of, secularization, buffered itself So Buddhism actually representative contemporary models of the psyche. Side quest. I think the Buddhism loves so I think forget Buddhism and this person's story. They're not Buddhist. They might have been heard some ideas, and it might have triggered, like, this idea of, like, you know, accepting and Desire leads to suffering and just let things be and that kind of attitude might be pervasive in our culture for what sounds like spirituality, But I think it's the problem is that This kind of opens up the problem space of world view and perspective And this person is someone who also says they have What is it called? Uh-huh. Bipolar disorder, and they have psychological challenges and difficulties. And so this idea isn't really helpful for her. I'm not sure. We don't need to get into the Buddhist metaphysics, but we do need to say that there's, like, modern secular psychology that has taken a lot of this stuff That which you resist persists and is it desire is the root of all suffering? Let it go. Let it flow. Whatever Like, short phrase motto that has become a part of popular culture is doing something inside of people's brains. Right? It's called like, a framing effect. And then when they do experience something in the heart, this idea that the heart actually knows things and can hold things but also they may neglect to acknowledge that the hearken see in no pain and evil and wrong. Not just duty. And this is why the 99 names have Jamal, beauty, and Jamal, majesty, and transcendence. And, like, here's 3 again. Maybe this is the 3. That we're talking about. How does it connect to everything here? Just saying something A tsunami Islamic psychology preserves access to a perceptual faculty that contemporary Western Psychology has methodologically excluded And this exclusion produces therapeutic approaches that can manage symptoms but can't orient towards telos. Yeah. I think so. I think it's not psychology is is didn't preserve. It's like it's making a comeback. It doesn't exist. We need to create these re reestablish the connection to that. Also realize that the human today is very different than the human that they're treating. As one of my teachers says, like, used to be you can take some homeopathic herb and then be healed, but we are so sick. And so The idea is, like, what will actually work? And this is why I'm doing this western psychology, like, traceable claim history trying to understand because I believe that framing matters. And instead of thinking of This as progress. And I think it made this and one of the big difficulties is like, yeah. We've progressed. We've learned so much. And every year we learn more. About psychology and about the soul and about not this all, about the about the self and about, you know, medicine and how to be live better, happier lives. And it's not true. We see the rise of loneliness and technology creating problems with so many different Thanks. It's it's funny that, like, people are praising these technologies for being able to carry children outside of womb, and they don't realize, like, oh my god. We made a simple app that let people like somebody else's pictures and we nearly destroyed democracy. What do you think technologies like that are gonna do? We need to really figure out what we're doing and how we're building. And this is my, like, penchant for this whole You know, parsimonious approach is like, let's just go back to the core that if we work on all these other downstream things will will be fixed. And the reason why I'm like, yeah. This real big vision and picture is I think we need to frame things so that people can accept them so that the transformation can happen. I don't wanna write something just for a Muslim audience. Wanna write something where people can say, oh, yeah. You're right. That is kind of what happened. And, oh, my god. You're right. That is why we want control. You know, and why we're trying to build yeah. We have been building things with this kind of way. And, like, I I'd rather it be like, oh my god, a And and then say, well, there are others. And, like, you know, people invented the steam engine and they didn't colonize the world and people in from China traveled the world with thousands of people on their their navy. And they just brought back zebras to show the emperor and see how cute it is. Like, look how Africa is cool. The West is like, no. But, like, progress is conquering and going around the world and industrial revolution, enslaving children and. It's like, no. That doesn't have to be like that. And it doesn't have to always be like that. And it doesn't just have to be one country taking over the other. There's a way that we can actually maybe just vie for Where virtue and have virtue be the thing that we're striving towards excellence. And I know there's a Quranic verse for this. If you can find it for me, that'll be great. Yeah. Maybe I will publish it after the corona. I I mean, like, why not? I have the time and space to think and to work, and I've had so much time thinking about this stuff and it's all cycling. And this is where all the words come. How am I gonna write something if I don't have words for it? This is where my words are.\nShow less\n\nIdentified core thesis tension between parsimony and multiplicity.\n12s\nOkay, here's what I'm seeing clearly now—and where I'm going to push back hard:\nYou want to write Question 6. You're energized by it. You have things to say. But you're also already building the sprawl: \"framing so people can accept transformation,\" \"not just Muslims,\" \"traceable from the West's philosophical moves,\" \"connect to Cursive,\" \"publishable\"...\nThat's not an essay. That's a manifesto. And manifestos are important—but they're not what Cambridge is asking for.\nLet me be direct about three things:\n1. The Parsimonious Trap\nYou said it yourself: \"I have this bias towards finding the one thing.\" Here's my pushback: that instinct is what makes your work powerful in practice (presilience cards, simple classroom protocols) but dangerous in theory. Because the \"one thing\" in philosophy always expands. Taylor's A Secular Age is 800 pages. MacIntyre's After Virtue rewrote ethics. You have 3000-4000 words.\nThe question is: do you want to write an essay that's generative (sparks conversations, publishable, influences your work) or comprehensive (tries to nail everything down, becomes unwieldy)?\n2. The Actual Choice\nLooking at your energy and what you've said, I think you have two real options:\nOption A: Question 8 - \"How do you see yourself applying what you have learned of holistic Hikma Medicine in your own practice/vocation/community service?\"\nWhy this could work:\nDirectly serves Cursive (you need a philosophical grounding for why handwriting matters, why human agency matters, why you're building \"paper for plural minds\")\nYou can bring in Gaza/Lebanon data as evidence of what works\nYou can critique Western tech design through the lens of practice rather than pure theory\nIt's publishable as a \"here's how to actually do this\" piece\nScope is naturally constrained by \"my practice\"\nOption B: Question 6 - \"Compare and critically analyse the main differences between traditional Islamic models of the soul and contemporary models of the psyche\"\nWhy this could work:\nYou're genuinely fired up about it\nThere's a real intellectual contribution (the heart as excluded perceptual faculty)\nYou can build on Taylor/MacIntyre\nBUT: You need to ruthlessly scope it\n3. If You Write Question 6, Here Are Your Cuts\nThree tangents you MUST NOT write about:\nBuddhism/cacao ceremonies/your friend's experience - It's a side quest. Cut it entirely. If you need an example of \"the West,\" use actual Western psychology (CBT, positive psychology, neuroscience).\nTechnology/Facebook/AI/China - This is Cursive material, not Cambridge essay material. One sentence maximum: \"These metaphysical assumptions produce not just therapeutic but technological interventions that optimize for symptom management rather than telos.\" Then move on.\nRoman bureaucracy/Black Plague/intergenerational trauma/colonialism/Chinese navy - You're doing genealogy of ideas, not comprehensive history. Reference Taylor's account of secularization, don't rebuild it. Two paragraphs max on \"how we got here.\"\nThe ONE empirical through-line you use: Your Gaza/Lebanon work, but ONLY as bookends.\nOpen: \"When I asked teachers in Gaza to describe healing, they used language of telos not symptom management—'preparing children for khilafa,' not 'reducing anxiety scores.'\"\nClose: \"The presilience protocols we developed show how recovery of heart-perception (gratitude as shukr, reflection as tafakkur) produces different outcomes than symptom management alone—not because they're culturally resonant, but because they're epistemologically different.\"\nEverything else is comparative analysis of the frameworks.\n4. A Possible Structure (IF Question 6)\nIntroduction (500 words)\nHook: Gaza teacher's language of healing\nYour claim: Islamic psychology preserves qalb as perceptual faculty; Western psychology methodologically excludes it\nWhy this matters: produces different interventions\nRoadmap\nPart 1: The Islamic Model (800 words)\nQalb, nafs, ruh, aql as integrated system with telos (fitrah-alignment, witnessing God)\nHeart as perceptual organ (not emotion)—what Taylor/MacIntyre miss\nKnowledge sources: revelation + reason + observation (building on your maristan work)\nBrief: how this produces interventions (maristan example)\nPart 2: The Western Model (800 words)\nBuild on Taylor: buffered self, loss of teleology, what counts as \"real\"\nNOT comprehensive history—just: \"Taylor shows how this happened; I'm showing what was lost\"\nContemporary psychology's metaphysical commitments: materialism, symptom focus, agency-maximization\nThe heart gets rewritten as \"emotion\" (psychology) or \"pump\" (medicine)\nPart 3: What Difference Does It Make? (800 words)\nComparing interventions: CBT vs. riyāḍat al-nafs, positive psychology vs. stations/states\nYour PTG data: character strengths that correlated—how would each framework explain this?\nThe practical difference: managing vs. orienting\nNot claiming Islamic > Western, but showing they're answering different questions\nConclusion (300 words)\nBack to Gaza: why the language matters\nNot revival, not syncretism—but recovery of a methodological insight\nThe verse you're thinking of (I think it's 5:48: \"For each We have appointed a divine law and a traced-out way. Had Allah willed He could have made you one community. But that He may try you by that which He hath given you [He hath made you as ye are]. So vie one with another in good works.\")\n5. The Honest Question\nAfter laying this out, here's what I think: Question 8 would serve your actual work better. Because:\nYou're building Cursive, not writing a philosophy dissertation\nYou need to articulate how to apply this more than what the differences are\nIt lets you be generative rather than comprehensive\nIt's naturally scoped\nThe \"for a Western audience\" move happens organically (you're explaining your practice to them)\nSo my five questions for you:\nWhich serves your life right now? Writing a tight theoretical analysis (Q6) or a practical application piece (Q8)?\nCan you actually cut those three tangents from Q6? Or will you keep sneaking them back in?\nWhat's the verse you're thinking of? (I think it's 5:48 or 2:148—I'll find it for you if you want)\nIf you write Q6, will you follow this structure? Or do you already feel it's too constraining?\nHonest answer: which essay can you finish in the time you have? Because sprawl doesn't just affect quality—it affects completion.\nYour move.\n\n\nso what might be our question, pick 3 different ones and then let's write my potential abstract\n\n\n",

      "content": "Here’s what I think is “the paper that’s in here,” and then three concrete options with a draft abstract for each.\n\n---\n\n## 0. The paper that’s already half-written in your head\n\nAt its core, what you’ve been circling is:\n\n> **How does the loss of the *qalb* as a real perceptual faculty in modern Western psychology change what we think healing is, compared to an Islamic model of the soul that is teleological and God-oriented?**\n\nThat lives most naturally under **Question 6** (compare traditional Islamic models of the soul with contemporary models of the psyche).\n\nBelow I’ll give you **three possible essay questions + abstracts** that all grow out of that, but with different levels of theory vs application.\n\n---\n\n## Option 1 – Big Theoretical Comparison (Question 6)\n\n**Cambridge prompt:**  \n*Compare and critically analyse the main differences between traditional Islamic models of the soul and contemporary models of the psyche.*\n\n**Your focused essay question:**  \n> **How does the exclusion of the *qalb* as a perceptual faculty in contemporary Western psychology re-shape the aims and methods of healing, compared to classical Islamic models of the soul?**\n\n### Draft Abstract – Option 1\n\nContemporary attempts to “Islamicise” psychology often assume that Western models of the psyche are neutral tools to which religious language can be added. This essay argues instead that traditional Islamic models of the soul and contemporary Western models of the psyche are built on different ontologies of the human being, which generate different understandings of what it means to heal.  \n\nDrawing primarily on classical Islamic scholars of *ʿilm al-nafs* (such as al-Ghazālī and Ibn al-Qayyim), I outline a model in which *qalb* (heart), *nafs*, *rūḥ* and *ʿaql* form an integrated system oriented toward a clear telos: witnessing God and living in harmony with *fitrah*. In this tradition, the *qalb* is not merely the seat of emotion but a real perceptual organ capable of receiving truth, with ethical and spiritual refinement (*tazkiyat al-nafs*) as the central therapeutic task.  \n\nI contrast this with key strands in contemporary Western psychology—behaviourism, cognitive-behavioural therapy, and positive psychology—whose shared metaphysical commitments (methodological naturalism, a buffered self, and suspicion of teleology) relocate “the real” to the measurable brain–body system and operationalise healing as symptom reduction and agency maximisation.  \n\nUsing post-traumatic growth research and character-strengths data from my work with social entrepreneurs and teachers in Lebanon and Gaza as an empirical thread, I show how these frameworks lead to different interpretations of the same phenomena and different interventions in practice. I conclude by arguing that recovering the *qalb* as a legitimate perceptual faculty does not reject Western psychology wholesale, but reframes it as one partial tool within a richer, teleological account of the human person.\n\n---\n\n## Option 2 – Your Practice & Future Work (Question 8)\n\n**Cambridge prompt:**  \n*How do you see yourself applying what you have learned of holistic Hikma Medicine in your own practice/vocation/community service?*\n\n**Your focused essay question:**  \n> **How could a holistic Hikma-based model of healing reshape the way I design learning environments and community programmes for post-traumatic contexts?**\n\n*(This directly serves your Gaza/Lebanon work, presilience, and even Cursive.)*\n\n### Draft Abstract – Option 2\n\nThis essay explores how a holistic Hikma Medicine framework can inform the design of educational and community programmes in post-traumatic contexts. Rather than treating “healing” and “learning” as separate domains, I argue that they can be integrated within a single, theologically grounded model of human flourishing.  \n\nI begin by summarising key features of the Hikma approach as taught in this course: its tawḥīdic metaphysics, its multi-layered view of the human being (body, psyche, and soul), and its insistence on embedding individual healing within family, community, and socio-economic structures.  \n\nI then turn to my own vocation: designing and facilitating programmes for social entrepreneurs and educators in crisis-affected settings such as Lebanon and Gaza, where my previous research on post-traumatic growth and character strengths revealed patterns of resilience tied to meaning, virtue, and communal responsibility. Using this empirical base, I show how a Hikma-informed model would reframe three aspects of my work:  \n1. **Aims** – from productivity and coping to preparing people for khilāfah, friendship with God, and responsible agency.  \n2. **Practices** – embedding remembrance, gratitude, service, and humour as “treatments” alongside cognitive and behavioural tools.  \n3. **Ecologies** – designing programmes, funding models, and technologies (such as handwriting-based reflection tools) that protect time, attention, and relationships rather than accelerating extraction.  \n\nI conclude by outlining concrete design principles for a Hikma-aligned practice of “presilience”: cultivating hearts and communities that are more alive, not just less symptomatic, in the face of ongoing hardship.\n\n---\n\n## Option 3 – Concrete Clinical Case (Question 7)\n\n**Cambridge prompt:**  \n*Using either a real or a hypothetical case: apply the Hikma Model that you explored in this course and apply its framework to the case, discussing assessment, diagnosis, and ‘treatment’.*\n\n**Your focused essay question:**  \n> **How would the Hikma Model approach the long-term care of a person living with multiple sclerosis, and how does this differ from a purely biomedical and secular psychological treatment plan?**\n\n*(You can base this on your father-in-law, but present it as a composite/partly fictionalised case.)*\n\n### Draft Abstract – Option 3\n\nThis essay applies the Hikma Model of holistic medicine to the long-term care of a middle-aged man living with multiple sclerosis (MS), contrasting it with a standard biomedical and secular psychological approach. The case is based on a real family member, anonymised and adapted for ethical reasons.  \n\nI first describe the conventional pathway: neurological assessment, pharmacological management of symptoms, and periodic psychological support aimed at coping, adherence, and mood regulation. While these interventions are important, they are typically framed within an implicitly materialist and individualist model of the self.  \n\nUsing the Hikma Model as presented in this course, I then re-assess the case across its key dimensions: metaphysical framing (how the illness is situated within divine wisdom and *qadar*), the state of the *qalb* and *nafs* (including despair, anger, or surrender), embodied patterns (pain, fatigue, and their spiritual meanings), relational and community dynamics (family roles, stigma, and support), and the wider socio-economic context.  \n\nOn this basis, I propose an integrated “treatment” plan that combines ongoing medical care with spiritual practices (such as dhikr, gratitude and complaint to God, re-reading the illness as invitation), ethical work (reframing family obligations, seeking forgiveness, and repairing ties), and community-level interventions (support circles, accommodations in mosque and workplace, and financial justice).  \n\nBy following one case in depth, the essay illustrates how the Hikma Model redefines what counts as improvement, moving from mere symptom control to a gradual purification of the soul, deepening of tawakkul, and strengthening of relationships with God and creation.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, next step could be: pick **one** of these three, and I’ll help you turn the abstract into a rough outline (section headings + key sources) so the sprawl has somewhere clear to land.",
