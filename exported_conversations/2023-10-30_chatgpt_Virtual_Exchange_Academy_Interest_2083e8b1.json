      "content": "Hi, my name is Mujtaba.\n\nI'll share with you an opportunity by Stevens Initiative. Read the details of the opportunity and help in writing out the application for it. I'll copy text from the opportunity's website and paste them in between dashed lines (---------). Here we go:\n\n---------\nApplication for the 2024 Virtual Exchange Academy\n\nOver the years, we’ve seen virtual exchange change countless lives by giving young people the opportunity to discover interests and strengths they never knew they had. Building off this progress, we launched a global movement to expand access to this powerful learning tool. As we work towards bringing virtual exchange to every young person around the world, we're empowering education and exchange leaders to drive virtual exchange adoption in their communities and networks by participating in the Virtual Exchange Academy.\n\nThe Virtual Exchange Academy is a six-week training that teaches foundational elements of virtual exchange planning and implementation. Participants get a comprehensive introduction from experts through pre-session reading and coursework, and during live sessions that include presentations, small group activities, and more. After the training, graduates will be prepared to adopt this powerful tool for connection and collaboration. \n\nThe 2024 Virtual Exchange Academy will take place once a week from January 31 through March 7, 2024, and will include six live sessions via Zoom. Each two-hour session will occur at one of the following times:\n\nWednesday, 4-6pm U.S. Eastern Time\nThursday, 10am-12pm U.S. Eastern Time\nApplications are due at 4pm U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 20, 2023. Questions can be submitted to stevenspartnerships@aspeninstitute.org.\n\nFollowing a competitive application process, participants will be placed in a small cohort with peers from around the world. Graduates of the Virtual Exchange Academy will:\n\nReceive recognition of their participation in the 2024 Virtual Exchange Academy through a digital certificate and badge.\nHave access to the community of practice of Virtual Exchange Academy alumni, including reunions and a LinkedIn group where participants can engage with each other to seek advice and connections as they bring virtual exchange to their communities.\nHave access to further mentorship following their participation in the Virtual Exchange Academy.\nHave access to funding opportunities available only to graduates of the Virtual Exchange Academy.\nEligibility: Education and exchange leaders at both the K-12 and higher education levels are welcome to apply. Prioritization will be given to applicants:\n\nWith little knowledge of or experience with virtual exchange. \nWho oversee a large youth community, such as a school, school district, higher education institution, or nonprofit network.\nFrom the United States, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America, though applications from other countries will be considered. If from the United States, applications from states where the Stevens Initiative has low or no reach will be prioritized. These states include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota. \nServing communities that have been traditionally marginalized from international education, including, but not limited to, Minority Serving Institutions and Title I schools in the United States and public institutions and institutions where English isn’t the primary language of instruction in locations outside the United States\nInterested in increasing virtual exchange opportunities as part of internationalization (incorporating global education) programming at their entire school, district, institution, or organization, not just a single classroom.\nTime Commitment and Expectations: Spots in the training are limited, and participants will be selected carefully. The Stevens Initiative expects full and active participation throughout the training. Participants should expect to spend around three and a half hours per week on this training, including the two-hour weekly live session and up to an hour and a half of pre-session preparation. This pre-session preparation will include the review of provided resources, videos, activities, publications, and other materials, and a quiz to measure learning and gather questions for each unit. \n\nThe success of this cohort-model training relies on engaged and attentive participants during live sessions and any other group activities. Live sessions emphasize interaction rather than passive learning. Participants are expected to do all pre-session preparation thoroughly and on time and arrive ready to engage in activities and discussions.\n\nThe Virtual Exchange Academy is supported by the Bezos Family Foundation.\n---------\n\nMe again (Mujtaba): In the application form, they have this text that explains how they prioritize applications:\n\n---------\nVirtual Exchange Experience\n\nEducation and exchange leaders at both the K-12 and higher education levels are welcome to apply. Prioritization will be given to applicants:\n\nWith little knowledge of or experience with virtual exchange. \nWho are education and exchange leaders overseeing a large youth community, such as a school, school district, higher education institution, or nonprofit network.\nFrom the United States, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America, though applications from other countries will be considered.

How will you benefit from learning about foundational elements of virtual exchange?\nPlease write your response below (200 words maximum).\n---------\n\nMe again (Mujtaba): I wrote the following rough draft as an answer. Please review it, tell me what I can do to improve it, and re-write it in a better way. Note this is a rough draft and I know that it has a lot of room for improvement, so feel free to make any changes necessary to make it better according to what you learned from the opportunities details above:\n---------\nWe are firm believers in the value of exchange programs for many reasons starting from our first-hand personal experience, as most of our team, including our 2 cofounders, have been on exchange programs ourselves and our lives were transformed through these experiences, as well as having witnessed the impact on the 50+ people we’ve brought in 5 exchange programs. Some of the wonderful results that we’ve seen people obtain after going through our exchange programs include openness, courage, humility, hunger for furthering own learning, hopefulness, and leadership.\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, we’ve started running online programs, and we’ve seen the value and impact virtual programs can create as we ran a virtual program, we call the 29-day challenge, through which people practice a new habit daily and report their progress through an online community platform called Mighty Networks.\n\nAfter seeing several successful implementations of virtual exchange programs, we’d like to transition our in-person exchange programs to the virtual world to increase our reach and impact without compromising on quality. As we’ve been going through the planning of this transition, we’ve come across challenges and open questions that we hope this training would help us sift through with more educated decision making.\n---------",

However, this shift presents unique challenges. The Virtual Exchange Academy offers the expertise we seek, ensuring our transition is both effective and impactful. By understanding the foundational elements of virtual exchange, we hope to make informed decisions that uphold the quality and essence of our programs.\n\n---\n\nThis version is more concise, directly addresses the question, and emphasizes the importance of the training for your team's goals.",

Our deep-rooted ties with marginalized communities and partnerships with grassroots organizations position us uniquely for virtual exchange. Being an Iraqi organization, our team's upbringing in diverse socio-economic backgrounds enhances our ability to empathize and connect with a broad spectrum of participants.\n\nWe've already initiated digital platforms, like our weekly English speaking meetups, demonstrating our capability to manage virtual interactions. Our extensive network, built over years of community engagement, provides a ready participant base eager for international exchanges. Additionally, our collaborations with tech firms and educational institutions ensure we have the technological and content resources to facilitate effective virtual exchanges.\n\n---\n\nThis draft emphasizes your organization's strengths, existing partnerships, and resources that make it well-suited for virtual exchange.

Here it is:\n\n\"Our three primary strengths are (1) our reach to tens of thousands of youth all across Iraq through our strong social media presence, (2) the close ties we've built with the community through 4 years of working closely with young people, and (3) the effectiveness of our pedagogy. For example, last summer we did a bicycle tour from the north of Iraq to the center and we were moved to see people recognizing us and coming together to be with us in every town and village we stopped at. It is because of this strong connection, each new program we announce receives thousands of applicants, and many of our alumni go on to become leaders in their community connecting us with even more people.\n\nOur team being led by Iraqi-Canadians who were brought up in Iraq, participated in exchange programs in the US, lived and worked internationally for several years, and later returned to Iraq, gives us a unique advantage leading from firsthand experience and being driven by a mission that we are deeply committed to. Through this quest, we've built partnerships with some international non-profits, such as AMIDEAST, World Learning, and USAID, as well as local organizations such as the American University in Baghdad, and grassroots organizations.\"\n\nWhat do you think?

The economic and political climate here makes international travel prohibitively expensive and often unattainable due to stringent visa restrictions. Virtual exchange breaks down these barriers, providing Iraqi youth with the enriching experience of cross-cultural dialogue and international exposure that physical exchange programs offer, but without the associated costs and logistical challenges.\n\nWe have witnessed the profound transformation that occurs when individuals engage with diverse perspectives and return from exchange programs. They come back with broadened horizons, increased empathy, and a deeper understanding of their place in a global context. By integrating virtual exchange into our offerings, we aim to replicate this transformative experience, making it accessible to a broader segment of Iraqi youth. It's a powerful tool for empowerment, fostering global citizenship, and equipping young people with the skills and perspectives necessary to thrive in an interconnected world.\n\n---\n\nThis response underscores the significance of virtual exchange in the context of Iraq's unique challenges and the transformative power of such programs.",
