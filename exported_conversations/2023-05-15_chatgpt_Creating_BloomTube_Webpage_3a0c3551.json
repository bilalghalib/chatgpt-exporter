      "content": "You can't directly influence the behavior of the YouTube video embed within a text-based environment like this. However, I can provide instructions on how to ensure that the video is centered and embedded properly in your webpage:\n\n1. To center the video, you can wrap the iframe in a div and apply CSS to center it. Here's an example:\n\n```html\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6FOUqQt3Kg0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n```\n\n2. Regarding the issue of the video being unavailable, please ensure that the video isn't region-locked or set to private on YouTube. You might also want to double-check the video ID in the YouTube link. The video ID is the part after \"/embed/\". For example, in \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6FOUqQt3Kg0\", the video ID is \"6FOUqQt3Kg0\". If the video is available on YouTube and the video ID is correct, it should display correctly.\n\nRemember that not all YouTube videos are available for embedding, as the video uploader can disable this feature. If the video is still not showing up, it's possible that this is the issue.\n\nFinally, please note that adjusting HTML/CSS and embedding YouTube videos can only be done in a code editor or a platform that supports HTML/CSS, not within this chat environment.",

      "content": "Yes, you can add a few lines to the script to remove any duplicate entries from the CSV data. This can be done by keeping track of seen entries and ignoring any that have already been processed. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open('data.csv', 'r') as f:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(f, delimiter=',')\n    data = list(reader)\n\nseen = set()\nunique_data = []\nfor row in data:\n    # Create a tuple of the row's values and check if it's in the set\n    row_tuple = tuple(row.values())\n    if row_tuple not in seen:\n        seen.add(row_tuple)\n        unique_data.append(row)\n\njs_var = 'const data = [\\n'\nfor row in unique_data:\n    title = row['Title']\n    artist = row['Artist']\n    theme = row['Character Strength']\n    message = row['Reason']\n    youtube_link = row['Link']\n    js_var += '  {\\n'\n    js_var += f'    title: \"{title}\",\\n'\n    js_var += f'    artist: \"{artist}\",\\n'\n    js_var += f'    theme: \"{theme}\",\\n'\n    js_var += f'    message: \"{message}\",\\n'\n    js_var += f'    youtubeLink: \"{youtube_link}\",\\n'\n    js_var += f'    genre: \"none\",\\n'\n    js_var += f'    releaseYear: \"none\",\\n'\n    js_var += f'    tags: \"none\",\\n'\n    js_var += '  },\\n'\njs_var += '];'\n\nwith open('output.js', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(js_var)\n```\n\nThis version of the script will first add all unique rows from the original data to a new list, `unique_data`. It then generates the JavaScript variable based on this deduplicated list.",
