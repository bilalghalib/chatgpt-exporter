      "content": "Summarize the following plan for our community at Bloom.pm and offer critiques for where you see holes in the plan:\n'\nBackground\nA quick recap of what happened in the past month and half:\nWe launched a survey to understand people’s interests\nWe ran an async open program on Growth Hacking\nWe organized a live pre-training session for the closing of the Growth Hacking challenge\nWe organized a live training workshop as a closing event for the growth Hacking challenge.\n\nLessons learned:\nLive sessions are needed to have better engagement\nWe need to leverage our facilitation skills\nWe need to include more the founders (Munir and Bilal) in terms of having them as \nWe need to have some kind of incentives\nWe need to better understand our audience and what we want to achieve with each type of audience.\n\nTherefore, we identified the need to understand our audience better, which led to the below full-scale study of whom to target, why, and how?\n\nThe Open Community Plan is divided into the following sections:\nTarget audience (personas)\nSuggested activities/programs (for each persona)\nIncentives\nCommunication channels\nPartners\nTimeline\nExecution plan & roles\n\nIn this meeting, we need to do the following:\nHave quick general comments on all the sections of the plan\nAgree on our target audience\nDecide which activities/programs are bringing the best value and are feasible to do\nNext step: I need to do some further research and reading, and based on all of that combined, I will be able to work on a final execution plan.\nTarget Audience (personas)\nHere is a list of the different personas that would make sense for us to target and nurture as an open community, including examples of our current audience.\n\nUniversity Students \nLebanon: AUB, LU\nAspiring entrepreneurs\nWomen entrepreneurs \nHMN teams who didn’t make it to the accelerator\nRural entrepreneurs\nPart of the HMN teams who didn’t make it to the accelerator\nUrban entrepreneurs \nA large number of people in our newsletter\nEstablished entrepreneurs\nOur alumni\nLGA / Part of ACSI / Part of HMN\nFamily business owners\nTo Be Defined\nGrowth-stage entrepreneurs \nPart of our newsletter subscribers\nUniversity professors\nTo Be Defined\nTrainers\nTo Be Defined\nInvestors\nTo Be Defined\n\nThis table breaks down the needs and interests of each persona we want to target. This helped me better shape the activities and the ideas we want to do for each segment.\nSuggested Activities / Programs\nUniversity Students \nPresent Like a Pro: Master Your Communication Skills!\nA month-long program, launched at an in-person meeting at their campus, followed by weekly online sessions. The work is based on our assessments and library and facilitated by us. No need for trainers. Bilal and Munir can play a nice role by sharing their expertise. Incentive: Certificate of participation, Final contest winner, Bloom gear gift. Winners get to participate in a TOT.\nPass the torch program!\nWe support the winners in the above program to organize programs for others, relying on our resources and our guidance. We can run a quick TOT for them to give them a boost at the start. Munir would play a central role in the TOT. Incentive: highlighting them and their impact as a success story in a blog post on our website.\nAspiring entrepreneurs\nWomen entrepreneurs \nMonthly Learning Challenge\nA month-long program. The topic is chosen based on this specific audience and promoted as such. Promoted online and through partner organizations focusing on women's empowerment. We run it online with the possibility to launch it at the premises of a women-focused organization. Incentive: TBD\nNurturing Positive Daily Habits\nThis program is focused on starting the month with a workshop highlighting the Bloom Calendar and then keep connecting async to encourage each other on daily basis. Probably best done on WhatsApp. Bilal would be the main figure for this workshop. Incentive: TBD\nWeekly Co-working (Pomodoro focus sessions)\nPeople join these sessions to really augment their chances to finish stuff they have been procrastinating on. The facilitation of these sessions should be designed such as people would really finish stuff. Munir can play a nice role in here as well as finish some pending stuff too :)\nRural entrepreneurs\nLebanon Revealed: A Series of Discoveries.\nWe support Rural Entrepreneurs to organize hiking, biking, or any kind of fun event that would highlight the village they come from. This would be a great networking opportunity for them and a nice break for urban and established entrepreneurs. Incentive: During this day there is a pause to do a collective intelligence exercise for the entrepreneur organizing the day. Bloom gear gift.\nMonthly Learning Challenge \nThe topic is chosen based on this specific audience and promoted as such. Incentive: TBD\nNurturing Positive Daily Habits\nSame description as before Incentive: TBD\nUrban entrepreneurs \nMonthly Learning Challenge\nThe topic is chosen based on this specific audience and promoted as such. Incentive: TBD\nNurturing Positive Daily Habits\nSame description as before Incentive: TBD\nEstablished entrepreneurs\nOur alumni (who have been on the market for more than 4 yrs)\nShare your human resource & save cost initiative\nWe create a category on our community where teams can add free team members able to work on other projects including the fees and the available duration. Other people can just contact them directly and have the person work for example one day a week for the other team for a specific period of time.\nTOT training to become mentors\nWe organize two or three times a year a several days workshop to train people on how to be good mentors. I assume a lot of our alumni would be interested.\nWorkshop on who to write blogs and build an expert profile in your domain\nWe don’t have content ready for this, and we even don't have someone who could support them on that. But definitely, it is something very valuable to anyone who wants to have a strong presence on the market.\nExperts meetings\nTopic to be discussed\nPanel Discussion\nTopic to be discussed\nFamily business owners\n\n\nGrowth-stage entrepreneurs \n\n\nUniversity professors\n\n\nTrainers\n\n\nInvestors\n\n\nIncentives\nSome incentives are mentioned above in each suggested activity, we are adding all the ideas here in order to consolidate the list.\nBloom gear\nUsing our office for meetings/workshops/co-working/mingling \nBloom media blitz (highlighting for a week on all our media channels a specific enterprise/product/service) \nUsing our tech tools (Zoom, what else?)\nBloom surgical intervention (meeting with four Bloom team members for four hours: one from comms, one from the program team, one from ops team, and one from learning and creativity team)\nFree babysitting for teams who have kids. \nCommunication Channels\nUniversity Students \nIn-person campus meetings through existing clubs\nFacebook, Instagram, Website, Emails\nBloom platform (Community)\nAspiring entrepreneurs\nWomen entrepreneurs \nFacebook, Instagram, Website, Emails\nOrganizations working with women\nBloom platform (Community)\nRural entrepreneurs\nFacebook, Instagram, Website, Emails\nOrganizations working in rural areas\nUrban entrepreneurs \nFacebook, Instagram, Website, Emails\nEvents\nBloom platform (Community)\nEstablished entrepreneurs\nOur alumni\nTo Be Defined\nFamily business owners\nTo Be Defined\n\"growth-stage\" entrepreneurs \nTo Be Defined\nUniversity professors\nTo Be Defined\nTrainers\nTo Be Defined\nInvestors\nTo Be Defined\nPartners (people or organizations)\nHaven’t worked on that yet\nTimeline\nHaven’t worked on that yet\nExecution plan & roles\nHaven’t worked on that yet\n'",

      "content": "Summary:\n\nThe Open Community Plan at Bloom.pm aims to improve engagement by targeting and nurturing specific audience personas and offering tailored activities, incentives, and communication channels. The plan is divided into sections, including target audience, suggested activities/programs, incentives, communication channels, partners, timeline, and execution plan & roles. The target audience consists of university students, aspiring entrepreneurs, women entrepreneurs, rural and urban entrepreneurs, established entrepreneurs, family business owners, growth-stage entrepreneurs, university professors, trainers, and investors. For each persona, various activities and programs are suggested, along with potential incentives and communication channels.\n\nCritiques:\n\n1. Lack of clear goals and objectives: The plan lacks a clear statement of what the community aims to achieve through these activities and programs. It is crucial to define specific goals and objectives for each target audience to measure the success and impact of the activities.\n\n2. Insufficient audience segmentation: While the plan identifies different personas, it does not provide",
