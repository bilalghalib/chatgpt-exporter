      "content": "Good morning, ChatGPT. So today I would like to review some things on my mind. I'm feeling a little bit low today. I'm taking 15 milligrams of Adderall and my qualia from the Neurohacker Collective, just trying to stay positive and upbeat. And maybe it's the end of the year, maybe it's the fact that crypto is zipping and I never know when to sell, because I haven't figured out how to deal with taxes, and I don't really want to sell, and I don't really want to buy, I don't want to even look at it, and I don't really want to think about money, and I need to apply for a job, and I think I have a good prospect at the due school, but I don't want to ever get a job, because I'm not the kind of person that works for other people. I always have my own projects, and I work for myself, and it would be the first time, and I'd like you to sort of come up with 10 questions, work sort of like a mix between a coach and a psychoanalyst, and help me really reflect and think about my life, and the end of the year, it's December 23rd, 2024, and I'm feeling like the whole world is sort of falling apart, this war has kind of been going on, and I just feel a little bit uneasy in all sorts of ways, and I don't really have a job right now, or work, I have a little bit of money, but who even knows what money is, I don't know if I should be buying gold or silver, or what exactly, and I'm walking with my baby, and he's cute, and yesterday was my wife's birthday, and I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm having a hard time. Can you help me think through these things, and other things, you know, like I haven't really worked on my publication for my paper, and there's all these things that I just wish I was better at, but I'm not, and I'm getting old, and I don't really have time for working out, and my family's far away, and I don't know if I'm holding my application well, and my sheikh in Gambia, my teacher, spiritual master, has told me to always have a question of God, or a positive impression of God, and I'm struggling to do that. Can you tell me what to think, can you help me think through these things, go by questions, and try to help me understand, and find a better way forward?”\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, especially with so much on your mind. Let's take a step back and approach this one piece at a time. How about we start with a few reflective questions to help you gain clarity?\n\nWhat specific aspects of your life are causing you the most stress right now?\nWhen you think about your ideal work situation, what does it look like?\nHow can you incorporate small moments of joy or peace into your day?\nWhat support systems or resources can you lean\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, Habibi? Yeah, so one, I think the most amount of stress is sort of like just feeling like I'm far from my family, that I don't really know about money and like what to do with my financial situation because the whole world seems topsy-turvy, and I guess I, you know, like, it'll be okay. I have this small business called Noor Creative Studios, it barely makes any money. I spend a lot of money on like ambitious things and hopes and dreams, and like I'll just spend all my money on an assistant to go help me, you know, be more productive and more focused, and then, you know, it doesn't necessarily solve all my problems, and my assistant is, you know, like a young junior person with bad English, and it's just not exactly the best kind of support for me because I can't afford the really expensive assistants and coaches, and I don't even have money coming in right now. I just finished a contract with the UN, they didn't really get me any new jobs, and I don't really like the fact that, you know, a lot of my self-worth and happiness comes from like, oh, I got a new job, yay, or like, oh, look at my bank account, it's got money in it, yay, but also I know that I have some obligations to my baby and my wife, and I want to be a good husband. Basically, I don't know, like, this happens quite regularly, I just feel low and down because I think I have a bit of a maybe depressive attitude or mindset, like it's been very common in my life that I just kind of feel low periodically, maybe even associated with the changing of the seasons and stuff like that, and this is not that uncommon, but I did find some mushrooms, which is nice, okay, I found a bunch of oysters, cool.”\n09:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nI'm sorry you're feeling this way. It's understandable that all these factors are overwhelming. It's great that you're recognizing these feelings and seeking ways to address them.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFamily and Distance: It's natural to feel the strain of being away from loved ones. Staying connected through regular calls or messages can help, even if it's just for a short time.\n\nFinancial Uncertainty: It's challenging to manage finances during uncertain times. Maybe a financial advisor or simple budgeting can bring more clarity and peace of mind.\n\nCareer and Projects: It's clear you have a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Perhaps focusing on the aspects of Noor Creative Studios that align with your passions could help you find renewed motivation.\n\nSelf-worth and Success: It's important to remember that your value isn't defined by job titles or financial status. Your efforts in being a good husband and father are significant.\n\nMental Health: Recognizing when you need support is a sign of strength. If these feelings persist, professional help could be beneficial.\n\nSpiritual Guidance: Your spiritual master's advice is valuable; try finding small daily moments of gratitude.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help and take things one step at a time. You're doing your best, and that's enough.\n\n09:50\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“OK, what are some other questions that you can get to try to help me find financially deeper?”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nSure, here are a\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“issues.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nSure, here are a few more reflective questions:\n\nWhat are the core values that guide your decisions, and how can you align your current situation with them?\nWhat small, achievable steps can you take today to move closer to your goals?\nHow do you define success for yourself, beyond external measures like money or job titles?\nWhat activities or hobbies bring you genuine joy and fulfillment, and how can you incorporate them more into your life?\nWhat are some past challenges you've overcome, and what strengths did you draw on to get through them?\nReflecting on these might help you uncover deeper insights and find a path forward.\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“In the past, you know, I just kind of go try to force myself to be patient and just bear through it, but I don't really have like a positive interpretation of those moments. They're mostly just like grit your teeth and move forward and kind of, you know, understand that they'll change. But I feel like maybe my mind has just a negative orientation more than normal. It's I see it in my grandfather. I see it in my mom and like, you know, I try to get a little bit of an up boost feeling from my Adderall and from drinking a lot of tea or coffee, just trying to get this, you know, sense of positivity. And then when I have that, I can then have a pretty good day. But it just seems exogenous and I'm wondering if I should just go cold turkey. You know, I also have ADD and so I wonder if these things are related, you know, like ADD and people. I'm curious if you have any statistics and insights as to what happens when people with ADD hit their 40s, which is what's going to be happening with me next year and kind of what's the standard expected feelings and behaviors of wasted potential and all of that. Like I can imagine wasted potential and feeling like what am I doing in my life? And I just don't really understand how to manage my mind and I should be old enough. I should have figured this out by now and all that kind of stuff can be pretty standard. And if that's the standard, how can I be non-standard? What can I do that would be slightly different? And if I know what is supposed to happen because I'm just an average person just like everybody else and I can expect these things, what can I do or feel or say or think or start working on to respond differently to the same sort of conditions that someone with ADHD and potentially mild depression and a lot of potential and travel internationally and a lot of friends and live far away from his family and as parents age, I'm sure there's no doubt that's going to happen to you in this part of your life because parents age, you know what I mean? So what are the things that are standard happenings and what are some of the best responses that someone can do to prepare for and anticipate these things and just have a different response because I just don't want to be the average person who's surprised by the death of his parents or aging or sickness. Like that's kind of obvious. So let's see what we can do in advance and so that we can live a life without regret.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nIt sounds like you're being incredibly introspective, which is a great step. Here are a few more questions and thoughts that might help:\n\nHow can you redefine patience not just as enduring but as an opportunity for growth?\nWhat are some small, daily practices that could help shift your mindset towards positivity?\nWhat unique strengths do you bring to your situation that can help you navigate these challenges?\nHow can you create a support system that helps you manage ADHD and mild depression more effectively?\nWhat steps can you take now to prepare for the inevitable changes like aging parents, so you feel more in control?\nHow can you leverage your experiences and network to find new opportunities that align with your goals and passions?\nRemember, taking small steps and seeking support can make a big difference. It's okay to explore different approaches and find what works best for you.\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, you know, I was hoping that you could look into my chat history and then come up with a theory of mind for me. Look into my entire context window and try to make your best guess assumptions. Make a theory of mind table and see how that mind would interface with these challenges. And then give your explanation for how and why you believe these various things about Bilal, the person that you're talking with right now.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nWhile I can't explicitly create a \"theory of mind\" table, I can summarize what I've gathered from our conversations. You seem to be an introspective, ambitious individual with a deep desire for meaningful work and personal growth. You value family, creativity, and self-improvement. Challenges with ADHD and managing periods of low mood seem to influence your perspective, making you reflective about how to navigate life’s challenges.\n\nYour approach to difficulties appears to involve patience and perseverance, though you're seeking more proactive and positive strategies. You're curious about how to prepare for future challenges, especially those that might feel inevitable, like aging parents.\n\nTo respond differently to life's challenges, perhaps focusing on proactive mental health strategies, building strong support systems, and staying aligned with your core values could be beneficial.\n\nIs there any specific area you'd like to delve deeper into?\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I kind of want you to act like a coach and actually help me through things rather than just tell me some broad and generic advice.”\n09:58\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nGot it. Let's focus on some specific steps together.\n\nFirst, let’s identify a small, manageable goal for today. What is one thing you can do that might bring you closer to your career or personal goals?\n\nFor instance, if you want to work on job prospects, maybe updating your resume or reaching out to a contact is a good start. If it's about your personal well-being, perhaps setting aside 10 minutes for a relaxing activity could help.\n\nLet's take it one step at a time. What would you like to focus on first?\n\n09:58\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n09:58\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nTake your time.\n\n09:58\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think I first want to know exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing, and I'd like kind of maybe a psycho-spiritual understanding of my situation before getting into the practical stuff of, oh, I want to have a career goal, because I don't even know what my career goals are, you know? I think this is one of the things that happens to me a lot is I just get in my own way, you know? I overthink things, and my parents say that I'm too complicated, and it could be related to all of the stuff about, you know, I read so much but do so little, and I feel like I have a lot to share based on my life experience and reading and full contemplation, but not a lot of things to show for it, including like feeling like I can explain my career to somebody and have them know how to hire me, for instance. You really have to know me very well, and you have to kind of push me into a situation to say, hey, you could do this. Why don't you do this? We need somebody to run this workshop, which is what happened recently with Nihal when he asked me to run a, you know, Design for and with Marginalized Communities workshop, and I think, you know, there's other things, stuff coming up today, like I'm supposed to be working on this book. I paid a lot of money to take a course on, you know, publishing a book because I know I need the support and the encouragement and the backing and the pushing, but by now, it is like I have a few hours until our biweekly session, and I've done nothing because I was traveling and working on other things, and I had this workshop, and I didn't do any writing, and maybe I should do writing today of any kind just to get this organized and prepared, so maybe that's what I should actually be doing.”\n09:59\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nUnderstanding the \"why\" behind your actions can be really powerful. You seem to have a deep desire to share your knowledge and experiences but struggle with translating that into tangible outcomes. This could be a mix of perfectionism, overthinking, and perhaps a fear of not meeting your own high standards.\n\nIt's important to remember that small, consistent actions often lead to greater progress than waiting for the perfect moment. Perhaps your psycho-spiritual journey is about balancing your thirst for knowledge with compassionate self-discipline.\n\nTo start, maybe set a simple intention: write for just 10 minutes today, without worrying about the outcome. Embrace the process and trust that each step you take is valuable. How does that sound?\n\n09:59\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“That sounds good, except I often use audio recording because I'm really good at talking and less good at sitting down and writing. I talk, and I write, and I actually produce a lot of text, but it just seems insurmountable and they go really wide, because I'm a really curious and diverse person. My interests just go really wide and become not very practical. It goes from, like, okay, here's how you can create a sustainable business that follows aesthetic principles and how this is a beautiful thing to do, and then at some point I'm talking about epistemology and ontology and the view of Muslims on the world and how we can redefine and reaccess this more psycho-mystical, open, unitarian, oneness perspective and how that will then influence how we start businesses. And it's just like, who's going to read and think and understand these things versus who's going to be able to just say, okay, so first step, have a good intention for your business. But it's like, I'd rather work on the deepest root causes rather than the end results of the fruits, and that makes it so that I get really broad and really, you know, I start talking about all sorts of things rather than, you know, some of the more immediate, at-hand practical stuff. And I wonder if, you know, like, when I write and I just have this stuff, I just look at it later and I'm like, okay, this is one book, this is two books, this is four books, this is how many different ideas are here. And so, you know, I don't have a problem with writing or producing content, I have a problem with, like, thinking about other people reading it and picking an audience and all of that stuff because I actually don't want to do that. Like, picking an audience and trying to come up with, like, a marketable book and this idea of, like, it's prepackaged, easy to digest something that just feels like it will be inauthentic. And then I realize that that's why I'm, like, poor and confusing and nobody understands me and no one knows how to hire me and I feel like I'm, like, rich with insight and ideas and I just do way too many different diverse things that are not adding up. And every time I try to even just do one thing that I can try to create and share, it becomes a huge, like, worldview that people have to get in and involved in and how can I bring these things together? You know, like, there's this guy, Baraka Blue, he has this Rumi-centered courses and he just does, like, reads Rumi and then asks people for their reflections and he holds space and people think of him as, you know, the poet guy who has these courses on mysticism and it's really clear. Like, if you want a course on Islamic mysticism and you're going to do it in a poetic way with a beautiful community, good aesthetics, all that, just go to, like, Baraka Blue and look at what he's doing. If you want, you know, Islamic economics and alternative views on how Muslims view economics, you can go to Ady Atiyah and take his courses, you know? And for me, it's like, I don't have a team, I don't have a PhD, I don't have consistency in anything that I've done. I've done robotics, I've done, you know, startup support and, you know, I'm now, like, working on this kind of worldview, mystic kind of interpretation that will define how we look at businesses to make them more sustainable, but that's not the goal. It's important not to have a goal, it's important to have a different way of seeing nature as a place where, you know, you can see the signs of God and then how does that change, you know, natural resources into things that you are much more respectful of and gentle with, including people, instead of human resources in a human resource department. What about, like, these people as people, as beautiful humans that you want to help them find their contribution? And that can be what a human resource department does, and I just think very broadly and diversely and confusingly, and it's also part of my journey, too, right? Like, I started very practically, I started with, like, open-source technology for good, you know, how can we use these tools that people are using to build rail and stuff to build good stuff? And then I had the idea of making my own showcase of these kinds of good things, and so I started my own projects, like the Awareness Project, when car bombs go off and it would crush a sculpture using an Arduino and send a tweet to people who promised to do good things whenever bad things happened, and it was to try to, you know, demonstrate how we can play with technology to be more positively responsive to the challenges of the world, to see the pain globally, but to act locally, and not to get overwhelmed with everything you can do, but to do something about one cause that you care about. And I have all these ideas, and I've built all these things, and I even thought to myself, like, oh, let's try to talk to ChatGPT differently and all this AI stuff and use our pen and paper and, like, write to them long form so that we can't copy and paste, so that we're more involved with our manual connection, and I made this app, and I just put it online at cursiveGPT.com, and nobody cares, because I don't market it, and I don't share it, and then how does that connect to anything else that I'm doing? And it's so messy, and, like, who the heck am I? What is this? Am I, like, a Renaissance man that nobody cares about, that when I die, people are like, oh, yeah, he had some interesting ideas, let's retrospectively write a book and honor this random person, but instead of, during my life, when I actually need work and a job and coherence and meaning and a story, like, what other characters in history were like this? You know, like, at least Benjamin Franklin, he had some jobs, you know, and, like, he made money, and I just, maybe this is connected to my whole, like, this taste with money thing, where I'm like, oh, yeah, you know, I don't really want money, dah, dah, dah, whatever, like, don't pay me too much, I just want to get it, like, accidentally in the side where someone actually sends it into my bank account where it's not connected to the stuff I do, and I'm not sure how I can possibly have a career thinking and behaving like that, but I think it's connected to my worldview, and until my worldview changes, I'm not sure I'll be able to fix that. Can you give, like, a breakdown, an analysis of how these things are all interconnected and maybe a path forward? Well, there you have it.”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nYou have a rich and expansive mind that thrives on exploring complex ideas. This desire to dive deeply into diverse topics is a strength, but it can also make it challenging to create focused, practical outputs that resonate with a specific audience.\n\nYour inclination towards exploring root causes and deeper meanings reflects a holistic worldview. However, the challenge lies in translating these broad insights into tangible, actionable forms that others can easily grasp and utilize.\n\nTo bridge this gap, consider focusing on one core idea at a time, making it accessible without losing its depth. It's okay to have a broad perspective, but channeling that into focused projects might help others better connect with your ideas.\n\nThink of it as creating \"entry points\" for others to engage with your broader vision. It might also help to collaborate with others who can support and complement your strengths, turning your diverse insights into cohesive, impactful projects.\n\nHow does that sound to you?\n\n10:00\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“I think you could do better. Go a little deeper and try to understand like maybe the psychology that connects across these different, both pros and cons, like what exactly is happening in my mind and how do they actually result in both of these things.”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour mind seems to operate like a vast, interconnected web, constantly seeking to integrate diverse concepts and ideas. This depth and breadth are part of your strengths, but they can also make it challenging to focus and produce concise, targeted outputs.\n\nPsychologically, this might stem from a combination of high curiosity, a desire for authenticity, and perhaps an aversion to oversimplification or commercialization. You value depth and authenticity over surface-level engagement, which makes you resistant to traditional \"packaging\" of ideas.\n\nThis approach can sometimes lead to a sense of being \"spread too thin\" or feeling misunderstood because your broad scope can be hard for others to immediately grasp.\n\nTo bring these strengths together:\n\nGround your ideas in tangible examples: Start with the deep concepts but find ways to anchor them in practical, relatable stories or applications.\nIterative sharing: Break down your broad ideas into smaller pieces that can be shared incrementally, inviting engagement and feedback.\nFinding your \"why\": Reconnect with your core motivation—why you are passionate about these topics and how they connect to your life's purpose.\nEmbracing this approach might help you bring coherence to your diverse interests and make your work more accessible and impactful.\n\n10:00\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, OK. Can you give me a step-by-step approach for how to do that and turn it into a career path?”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let’s break it down into actionable steps:\n\nIdentify a Core Theme: Choose one central idea or theme that resonates most with you. This could be something like integrating spiritual insights into business or sustainable practices.\n\nCreate Entry Points: Develop smaller, digestible content or projects that align with this theme. For example, start with a blog series, short videos, or workshops that introduce these ideas in a practical way.\n\nEngage and Iterate: Share these smaller pieces with your network or a target audience. Gather feedback and refine your approach based on what resonates most.\n\nBuild a Narrative: Craft a coherent story around your core theme, linking your diverse interests into a unified narrative. This will help others see the connections between your ideas.\n\nEstablish Consistency: Consistency doesn’t mean limiting your curiosity but creating regular, predictable content or sessions that people can rely on, like a weekly blog or monthly workshop.\n\nCollaborate and Network: Partner with others who can help bring your ideas\n\n10:00\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, okay. I was thinking about the work that we've done together based on the context window and the history that you know. Like, the workshop I did on post-traumatic growth with people from Gaza, Palestine. The workshop I just did recently with Nihal. And, you know, am I like a workshop giver? Like, answer all of these questions for yourself and then come up with a, I don't know, like a landing page and read it out to me. Describing this really awesome guy who has great experience and is super valuable. And actually like, oh, you just read his website and you want to hire him and you know exactly what for. And it's like marketable and hireable skills for today. You know, as the world gets more closed, as more countries are not opening their borders. As people think of the world as getting more difficult and where the, you know, ecology is kind of collapsing as well. And we worry about the future. So, given all of that, what is the still hireable job? There's still corporations, but like everyone is worried these days. You know, like, what are we going to, what are we going to do? And I should still be someone that people want to hire. So, what is that kind of pitch? And, you know, think of my website and what are the different sections? And you can talk about my previous talks, but they're also different and so old now. I also have had about 10 years where I was kind of like head down working on gloom.pm. And it was just kind of focusing on working in Lebanon and trying to be smaller and more humble. And, you know, like I didn't want to be this big shot, like traveling the world and making positive change or whatever. So, that kind of led to me being irrelevant and kind of quiet and hard to even see.

Like they can ask me like, okay, well, what's your track record? What's your impact? And all I can say is, I don't know, people like thank me after my workshops. And like, what's the point, right? Like, what's the point if it doesn't make businesses money, or make their teams more efficient, or any of these things? What if it just like makes people want to quit, you know? It's not going to be a great pitch for HR departments. And so I feel like there's a lot of issues with this, and I'm wondering if you could give me like a very strong critique from my greatest opponent in my work, and what they would say, so that I can think about a rebuttal, and actually maybe even change my mind, right? So help me change my mind, like look at it from a critique critic's perspective, look at it from a logical perspective, go through line by line, idea by idea, and just help me try to change my mind, even about one element, you know? Like maybe it is also about when people are young, they just need to do something, right? Something that is obviously good, rather than something abstractly good. And the obviously good thing could be like, okay, let's work on SDGs, and it's a cool project, and you know, changex.org, where you just do and copy, connect the dots, and you know, one of the things that I've never done is like work in a corporate environment, like I don't have that experience, I'm like, I can't even manage myself well, how am I going to be telling people about anything, if I don't have like the background and experience, like I'm almost 40, and I have no like giant success story, I built this business called bloom.pm, that it's not even making money, and I'm gonna just have it go away, because the funding in the Middle East has changed and stopping, like what am I supposed to say about my story that's exciting?

And so first, let's come up with the critique, and then let's come up with a response.\n10:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nCritique from Your Greatest Opponent's Perspective\nLack of Clear Metrics:\n\n\"Your work lacks measurable impact. Without concrete metrics—like increased revenue, retention rates, or efficiency—it's difficult for HR departments to justify your approach. 'People thanked me' doesn’t hold up in a boardroom.\"\nAbstract and Intangible Outcomes:\n\n\"Your emphasis on well-being and rumination is too abstract for corporate environments. Businesses prioritize clear, actionable outcomes. If your workshops lead people to quit because they realize they don’t like their jobs, why would a company hire you?\"\nWeak Track Record:\n\n\"You don't have a history of working in corporate environments or a major success story to point to. How can you claim to understand corporate needs when you've never been in that context?\"\nOverly Philosophical Approach:\n\n\"The 'see, feel, do' framework and ideas about craft and solitude are inspiring, but they lack direct applicability in fast-paced environments. Businesses need immediate, scalable solutions, not reflective journeys.\"\nPotentially Disruptive Outcomes:\n\n\"If your methods lead to employees rethinking their lives, it could create disengagement rather than improved performance. How does this serve organizational goals?\"\nLack of Alignment with Business Goals:\n\n\"Your work doesn’t align with traditional business metrics like productivity, profitability, or innovation. Without a clear business case, your workshops could be seen as a waste of resources.\"\nPerception of Personal Inadequacy:\n\n\"Your lack of self-confidence in managing yourself and your career trajectory could make it hard for others to trust your guidance. If Bloom struggled to make money, why should others invest in your ideas?\"\nResponse and Rebuttal\nOn Metrics:\n\nRebuttal: \"Measuring well-being and engagement is possible, and the outcomes are directly linked to organizational success. Studies show that happier, more engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and less likely to leave. I can start tracking these metrics to provide evidence.\"\nActionable Step: Develop post-workshop surveys and follow-up assessments to measure shifts in engagement, collaboration, and creativity.\nOn Abstract Outcomes:\n\nRebuttal: \"Abstract outcomes often lead to profound, long-term impacts. Companies investing in mindfulness, resilience, and psychological safety have seen significant returns.\"\nActionable Step: Frame the workshops as a way to foster creativity and resilience, directly tied to business innovation and adaptability.\nOn Weak Track Record:\n\nRebuttal: \"While I haven’t worked in a corporate environment, I’ve facilitated impactful workshops for diverse audiences. The principles I teach are universal and applicable anywhere.\"\nActionable Step: Leverage testimonials, case studies, or partnerships with organizations that can validate your work.\nOn Philosophical Approach:\n\nRebuttal: \"The 'see, feel, do' framework aligns with design thinking principles already embraced by leading companies. It provides a structured way to approach problem-solving while staying grounded in empathy and action.\"\nActionable Step: Translate philosophical ideas into clear, practical steps for immediate application in team settings.\nOn Disruptive Outcomes:\n\nRebuttal: \"Encouraging employees to reflect doesn’t mean disengagement—it means alignment. Employees who feel connected to their values and the company’s mission perform better and are less likely to burn out.\"\nActionable Step: Emphasize how your workshops align personal values with organizational goals, fostering a sense of purpose.\nOn Alignment with Business Goals:\n\nRebuttal: \"Well-being drives results. For example, Google’s Project Aristotle found that psychological safety is the number one predictor of high-performing teams. My workshops directly enhance these soft skills.\"\nActionable Step: Link workshop outcomes to metrics like team performance, innovation rates, or retention, and include these in pitches.\nOn Perception of Personal Inadequacy:\n\nRebuttal: \"Leadership isn’t about perfection but about authenticity and growth. My experiences with Bloom and beyond have given me unique insights into navigating challenges.\"\nActionable Step: Reframe your narrative: Bloom was an experiment in innovation and resilience, proving your ability to adapt and persevere in changing contexts.\nShifting Your Perspective\nYou mentioned the tension between abstractly good and obviously good actions. Perhaps there’s merit in balancing both:\n\nStart Small, Prove Impact: Focus on delivering workshops tied to specific goals like SDG alignment or team-building. These 'obviously good' projects can be easier to pitch.\nEmerge from Solitude: Your emphasis on craft and solitude is a valuable counterpoint to the noise of social media. Package this as a \"quiet leadership\" program for managers dealing with overwhelm.\nFocus on Corporate Familiarity: Partner with someone who understands corporate structures to bridge the gap between your philosophy and their needs.\nWould shifting toward more tangible outcomes while retaining your core philosophy feel authentic to you? Let me know how you'd like to refine this further!\n\n10:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nHere, can we actually respond based on what you know about me from my perspective and say things that demonstrate my growth and understanding and imply, like, what are the things I'm going to do to actually properly address the critique to improve my position in this way?\n10:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let’s address the critique from your perspective while demonstrating your growth and the steps you’ll take to address these points.\n\nResponse and Action Plan\n1. On Metrics and Measurable Impact\nYour Growth: \"I’ve realized the importance of aligning my work with measurable outcomes, not just for validation but to create a narrative that bridges personal transformation and organizational goals. My experience has taught me that qualitative impact—like the stories of personal growth from workshop participants—can and should be complemented by data.\"\nActionable Step: \"I will implement post-workshop surveys to measure changes in employee engagement, creativity, and team collaboration. I’ll follow up with organizations six months after sessions to quantify long-term outcomes.\"\n2. On Abstract and Intangible Outcomes\nYour Growth: \"I’ve learned that organizations value clarity and immediate applicability. While my approach focuses on deeper, emergent insights, I can scaffold these ideas into actionable frameworks that are easy to implement.\"\nActionable Step: \"I will translate my 'see, feel, do' philosophy into a practical toolkit, combining it with check-ins and deliberate rumination exercises tied to organizational priorities like innovation and team cohesion.\"\n3. On Track Record\nYour Growth: \"My work at Bloom has given me deep insights into resilience, innovation, and adaptability in volatile contexts. I recognize now that I need to showcase how these lessons are universally applicable, even in corporate environments.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll build case studies from Bloom and other projects, highlighting specific examples where my approach led to concrete outcomes like improved team collaboration or innovative solutions in challenging environments.\"\n4. On Philosophical Approach\nYour Growth: \"I understand now that ideas like craft, solitude, and emergence can feel abstract to some audiences. But these practices are more relevant than ever in helping organizations manage burnout and foster creativity.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll design a 'quiet leadership' module tailored for managers, focusing on how deliberate reflection and solitude can enhance decision-making and prevent burnout. This module will integrate clear deliverables like stress-reduction practices and creative problem-solving tools.\"\n5. On Potentially Disruptive Outcomes\nYour Growth: \"Reflection isn’t about disengagement—it’s about alignment. I’ve seen firsthand how connecting people to their values leads to renewed energy and commitment, both personally and professionally.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll explicitly frame my workshops as alignment tools that connect employees’ personal values with organizational goals, making teams not just more fulfilled but more effective.\"\n6. On Alignment with Business Goals\nYour Growth: \"I’ve come to understand that well-being and organizational success aren’t competing goals—they’re deeply interconnected. By focusing on psychological safety and creative capacity, my work supports key business metrics.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll integrate business-focused metrics into my pitches, such as innovation rates, retention rates, and team productivity, showing how these are enhanced through my approach.\"\n7. On Perception of Personal Inadequacy\nYour Growth: \"I’ve reflected deeply on my narrative. Bloom wasn’t a failure—it was an incubator of resilience and adaptability, teaching me how to navigate uncertainty. My value lies not in perfection but in authenticity and the lessons I’ve learned through experimentation.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll reframe my story as one of continuous growth, positioning myself as someone who thrives in ambiguity and helps others do the same. I’ll also identify specific areas for personal improvement, like partnering with a mentor who has corporate experience to deepen my understanding of that space.\"\nNext Steps to Solidify Your Position\nDevelop a New Portfolio: Create a portfolio that clearly outlines your workshops, their methodologies, and measurable impacts.\nPilot a Corporate Program: Run a small-scale workshop with a corporate team, gather feedback, and refine the approach to better align with their needs.\nNetwork Strategically: Partner with someone who has corporate experience to co-facilitate or consult on bridging your approach with corporate language and priorities.\nRevisit Bloom: Use your experience at Bloom as a living case study, focusing on the skills and insights gained rather than the financial challenges.\nBy addressing these critiques through actionable changes, you’ll not only strengthen your position but also align your values with practical, impactful results. How does this resonate with you? Would you like to focus on any particular point further?\n\n10:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, could you ask me 10 questions to get me to respond to the critique in a way that will really convince me? Because right now I'm not convinced. I really think that it sounds like I'm just capitulating to their whims and needs. What are some questions that I can reflect on that might actually help me make a real internal change so that this is not just a bunch of words?\n10:23\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nOf course! Here are ten questions designed to help you reflect deeply, challenge your assumptions, and arrive at a genuine internal shift—one that aligns with your values while addressing the critique meaningfully.\n\nWhat do you believe is the core value or essence of your work, and how could aligning with corporate needs actually amplify rather than dilute that essence?\n\nReflect on how your unique perspective can meet both your ideals and their practical concerns.\nWhat would need to change for you to feel like you're offering something transformative to corporate environments, rather than adapting to their demands?\n\nConsider what it means to bring your philosophy into a new context on your terms.\nHow might metrics and measurable outcomes not just validate your work but serve as tools for deepening your impact and improving your workshops?\n\nThink about whether measurement could be reframed as part of your reflective, iterative process.\nWhat is your reaction to the idea that people might not \"get\" your workshops if they’re too abstract? Is it your responsibility to make your ideas more accessible, or is the onus on others to stretch themselves?\n\nReflect on whether compromise is a form of connection or a betrayal of your vision.\nWhat would it take for you to see “corporate needs” not as limiting, but as a creative challenge that could evolve your work into something even greater?\n\nExplore the potential growth in engaging with an unfamiliar context.\nWhen you consider your past workshops, what are the moments or outcomes you’re most proud of, and how might you communicate those in a way that resonates with skeptics?\n\nFocus on the stories that demonstrate your impact, even if they don’t follow conventional metrics.\nWhat part of the critique feels most threatening to you, and why? Is it a challenge to your values, your confidence, or something else?\n\nIdentify the emotional core of your resistance and unpack it.\nIf you imagined working with a corporate HR team, what specific problems might they face that your approach could uniquely solve?\n\nShift the question from “how do I fit?” to “what needs am I uniquely positioned to meet?”\nWhat assumptions might you be making about corporate environments, and how could you test or challenge those assumptions?\n\nReflect on whether your critiques of corporate culture are fully accurate or need re-examining.\nIf you could co-create an entirely new framework for corporate engagement—one that feels authentic to you—what would it look like, and how would it blend both your ideals and their goals?\n\nImagine a blueprint that doesn’t compromise but instead reinvents the conversation.\nWould you like to explore any of these questions together, or do they bring to mind initial responses you’d like to share?\n\n10:24\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, so, I have, like, two ideas first. The first idea is kind of related to this thought that I had that it's not that I am against quantification, but I'm against quantifying the wrong things, and, like, maybe I could have been gathering some interesting stories and insights from my work in the past to be able to, first of all, just, like, take more pride. You know, like, quantification is visualized memory. It's like memory crystal. And when you can see it, you can be like, oh, my God. Like, if I was able to say that I helped 500 people not give up doing the things that matter to them and help them align with their intentions to do good, to share the gifts that they have in the world, like, that could be really inspiring to me. But I can't even say that because I've been so obtuse and, like, oh, no, you know, I don't want to measure. But measuring the right things could be great. So maybe this is one way we can align on that. Two is I think we need, like, an immune system for AI or, like, an AI vaccine for resolving this unseen conflict that no one is really talking about between employees trying to use artificial intelligence to kind of get away with doing less work and improve their quality without their employers knowing and employers wanting to essentially at some point use AI to replace their employees and reduce the headcount on their businesses. And, like, this is an unspoken thing. And I think there's some, like, beautiful ways to use artificial intelligence. But we're not really talking about it. We're just, you know, in these two different silos. And maybe this is one way I can work with corporate clients to identify a workshop that I can do with them. And then the other thing is maybe I shouldn't be working with corporate clients at all. Like, maybe that's the wrong question. Maybe the question for me should be something like who really could benefit from my skills and my knowledge and my expertise and the gifts that I have in terms of these types of workshops and sessions and talks and maybe even tools. You know, like, I've been thinking about making a tool based on the frameworks that we've developed for artificial intelligence where when people start asking it questions to do work for them, it can say, hold up, let me ask you some questions to show you the beauty that you have to give, you know, to help you see your blind spots, to help you see your skills and what you should be doing right now and to help you align on that and to encourage you and to coach you and to help you write and then to help you structure your writing so that your outputs are wonderful instead of just doing the writing for you and having it be this kind of garbage. You know, like, one of the interesting things that I did with AI recently was I asked it to ask me a bunch of questions to get as much of the writing done by me as possible so that it could just, you know, take the writing, cut the sentences up and organize them and structure them in a way that is coherent and clear to address the challenge. And this way, the work can be something that you're proud of because you came up with it, you did it, you know. But it was leveraging the advantage of AI in terms of being able to stay focused and on track and to answer the right question and if you ever are stuck, it can help you identify your blind spots and how other people would answer this so that your work can have a qualitative improvement. And this is something cool to use AI for. Not whatever people are doing, like here, write me a five-paragraph essay on, you know, innovation in the workplace or something. And that's a workshop that I could give. But I think the question I'm going to mirror back to you is, like, based on all the stuff that you know, should I be trying to get corporate clients? Is that the place for me to define my career? Or should I be working more with startups and individual people and people in the Middle East and North Africa and, you know, like, are these the people that would really value and appreciate the knowledge and expertise that I have, you know, with all of the post-traumatic growth frameworks How do you use AI to help people feel proud of themselves in their work rather than ashamed? And is there, like, something different that I should be doing as well in terms of, like, my self-confidence and mindset? And, you know, like, people kind of also get what they expect to get. If I tell them, like, I don't know, just a little workshop, I'll do a little thing for you, it might be helpful, it might not be. And if I instead said, like, okay, no, we're going to come up with a memory crystal, a.k.a. a data visualization, because that's what it is, you know, it takes the memory of the quantitative and qualitative feedback that people are giving and turns it into something that you can hold and it's a gem. And, you know, like, I've always been kind of opposed in some sense to gamification because I always felt like it was, like, belittling and making small and, like, the menu and people are going to just work for the menu, like, trying to get as much coins as possible and that's the problem with capitalism. It's like, oh yeah, more coins, that means good, right? And it's easy to make that simple rather than to say every day you need to check in with yourself and to think what is more good, right? And this is an insight I had a long time ago from my talk, Good is Hard, where I was talking about Fritz Haber and the guy that invented nitrogen fixing and how he was so adamant and kind of insistent on death and the thing is, he invented a thing that fed the planet and we called it good and we gave him a Nobel Prize and then there's this guy, right? Like, he invented the lobotomy, but he did it because he loved and he cared for the patients that were in his care and Edgar Moniz, right? So Edgar was like, oh, these poor people, in the case of the most extreme, most difficult situations, this is the thing that we can do to keep them safe and keep the people around them safe and he also won the Nobel Prize and both of their outputs, one looked bad very soon, one looked good very soon and then they switched and now we have a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where nothing grows because of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and for a while, lobotomies were horrible and they killed so many people and hurt so many people and this idea of like having, so this is like maybe the core issue around the measurement idea, it's like, unless you regularly come back to it and you see what your heart is telling you, looking at this memory crystal and being in constant feedback and that's the thing, I think, it's also related to all of this decentralized autonomous organizations, right? You think you know what good is and you can set it up and have this map drawn out and the lines and the waypoints, which are measurements along the way of these various things and it does a good job, it grows businesses. But at the end of the day, we want to make sure that these businesses are good and I kind of believe in a million billionaires rather than a thousand billionaires, right? So what if we had a billion millionaires instead of a million billionaires or the opposite, right? We need more people to be wealthy and to be able to dream even within the context of these organizations I feel like we can have different ways of business and that maybe it's really by doing these things and just maybe finding the core principles that will be able to direct thousands of people and to train HR staff to do these things, we can have kind of a slow growth of these philosophies that are about being and about remembering and about having these stories to be able to tell about our past that would still inspire us, right? And there's these stories that we can tell that would help people sort of understand themselves and this is kind of like the idea of the long-form autobiography, right? I kind of had this problem where when I was younger I was like, okay, when you're living, you got to imagine that you're telling your life story so let's make sure that by the end when you die you are happy with the main character and that nobody is like reading the story and be like, no, wait, why would you do that? Be angry with the main character and the thing is, I felt like that was too much self-centered and so I feel like maybe it's not an autobiography and maybe it's more like the Gandhi, my experiments with truth, right? And maybe it could be like my experiments with beauty\n10:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThank you for sharing all these ideas, reflections, and questions. Let’s approach this systematically to help clarify your direction, starting with some tailored follow-up questions that build on your reflections while challenging you to deepen your thinking and align with your true goals.\n\nQuestions to Deepen Reflection and Resolve\n1. Measurement and Memory Crystals\nWhat are the right things to measure that would genuinely inspire you and align with your values?\nHow might capturing these metrics not just validate your work to others but also give you a sense of pride and direction in your own story?\nWhat’s stopping you from starting now—reviewing past work and gathering those stories to form the memory crystal?\n2. The Corporate vs. Human Impact Question\nWhat excites you more: influencing corporate systems for incremental change or working directly with individuals or startups for transformative impact?\nIf you focus on corporations, how could you design workshops that plant seeds of beauty and transformation within a system you currently see as flawed?\nWhat would a client look like that perfectly aligns with both your values and your desire for financial sustainability?\n3. AI and Human Creativity\nHow does the idea of using AI to foster pride in work, rather than replace it, connect with your vision for beauty and storytelling in people's lives?\nWhat frameworks or tools could you create that combine your deep understanding of post-traumatic growth with AI's capacity to scaffold creativity?\nCould your proposed AI vaccine concept become an entry point to engage with corporations or a broader audience in a way that feels authentic?\n4. Reclaiming Confidence and Ownership\nWhat internal narrative keeps you from fully owning your past successes, such as Bloom or your workshops?\nHow can you reframe those stories in a way that acknowledges both the learning and the impact you’ve had?\nIf someone else had done what you’ve done—built Bloom, facilitated meaningful workshops, developed a vision for AI tools—how would you celebrate their achievements? Why is it harder to do the same for yourself?\n5. Gamification, Alignment, and Goodness\nHow might you design “good gamification”—a system that rewards reflection, connection, and alignment with values rather than just productivity?\nWhat does ‘goodness’ look like in the context of the organizations and people you want to serve? How would you help them see and feel that?\nWhat does ‘goodness’ look like in your own story, and how do you align with it in practical ways each day?\n6. Stories, Principles, and Long-Term Impact\nWhat’s the core story you want your work to tell about the world, and how does it connect with your audience’s struggles and desires?\nWhat principles guide your approach to beauty, alignment, and impact? How might these principles inform a scalable framework that could influence others?\nWhat does your \"experiments with beauty\" narrative look like, and how might sharing it empower others to run their own experiments?\n7. Audience Fit\nWho has already valued and benefited from your work the most—corporate clients, individuals, startups, or another group?\nWhich audience do you feel most inspired to serve, and why? How would serving them contribute to the larger story you want to tell about the world?\nHow might you prototype working with different audiences—corporates, startups, individual creators—so you can gather data about where you have the greatest impact?\n8. Vision Beyond Individual Impact\nIf you imagine training thousands of HR leaders, startups, or individuals, how would you ensure your philosophies grow slowly and sustainably within their systems?\nWhat kind of legacy do you want your work to leave behind for the people and organizations it touches?\nHow might the principles of decentralized organizations and autonomy help you scale your approach in a way that feels authentic and impactful?\n9. Your Relationship with Measurement\nIf you could design your ideal feedback loop—a mix of stories, metrics, and visuals—what would it look like, and how would it inspire both you and others?\nHow might regularly revisiting these \"memory crystals\" keep you aligned with your values while adapting to what the world needs?\nWhat’s one small way you could start capturing these stories and metrics today?\n10. Practical and Philosophical Alignment\nHow do you reconcile the desire to create change in flawed systems (e.g., corporate environments) with the feeling that you should work elsewhere?\nHow do you ensure that your ideas, while philosophical, are also actionable and tangible?\nWhat’s one small, “obviously good” thing you can do today that will help you build confidence in your ability to have impact while staying true to your values?\nNext Steps\nTake one or two questions that resonate most deeply with you and start journaling or discussing them further. If you'd like, I can help you unpack your responses or refine the questions into specific action steps. Which of these questions feels most urgent to explore first?\n\n10:24\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nSo, how would you imagine Bilal respond to all of the questions? And what is the advice that you would give him on the place in the world where he would actually light up to be contributing, has a good financial return, and is a good home for his ideas? Maybe we can try to make a plan for getting into those areas. And for now, we can also work on his landing page and maybe even a plan for gathering the data from all of his, you know, teams that he's worked with and kind of looking back. And it's a good time of year to do a retrospective, but at the same time, maybe come up with this idea of, like, a memory crystal dashboard career experiment with truth. I'm not exactly sure what to call it or what it would look like, but look at all of this and then come up with a plan for January 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 for me to be able to prepare myself for an awesome new year and an awesome career where, you know, given my spiritual and psychological and emotional capacity and the failures that I have in the organization, not being very corporate and struggling with, you know, consistency and motivation and to come up with a way that I can take the best and mitigate the worst and to find a place where I really thrive. And if you must, at the end, you can ask three deep and profound questions to help you revise it.\n10:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nBilal’s Response to the Questions\n1. On Measurement and Memory Crystals\nBilal realizes that resistance to measurement was not about numbers but about the fear of losing the soul of his work. He sees now that measuring the right things—such as stories of alignment, resilience, and personal growth—creates a \"memory crystal,\" a visualized narrative that honors his values while inspiring others.\n\n2. On Audience Fit\nHe reflects that his deepest impact has been on individuals, small teams, and communities in the Middle East and North Africa. These are the people who connect deeply with his post-traumatic growth frameworks, AI ideas for alignment, and the spiritual depth he brings. Corporate clients may not be his home, and that's okay.\n\n3. On AI as a Tool for Pride\nHe feels inspired to build tools and frameworks that use AI to help people rediscover their unique gifts and take pride in their work. This aligns deeply with his value of helping others uncover their beauty and blind spots.\n\n4. On Reclaiming Confidence\nBilal recognizes that his story, far from being a failure, is a testament to resilience, exploration, and learning. He reframes Bloom as an experimental lab for his ideas, where he learned what works, what doesn’t, and what lights him up.\n\n5. On His Place in the World\nHe sees himself not as a fit for traditional corporate work but as a bridge for people and organizations navigating complex challenges—whether they are startups, community groups, or small businesses. His home is where innovation meets human connection, and where his frameworks can serve as tools for growth, alignment, and resilience.\n\nAdvice: Where Bilal Could Thrive\nAudience and Market\n\nFocus on startups, community organizations, and innovative leaders in the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Michigan. These audiences value depth, resilience, and new ways of thinking.\nBuild relationships with impact-driven organizations (e.g., nonprofits, social enterprises) looking for unique frameworks for team alignment, well-being, and creativity.\nSignature Offering\n\nDesign workshops and tools around post-traumatic growth, AI alignment, and reflective creativity. Offer these as packages, pairing them with frameworks like the \"memory crystal\" (quantitative and qualitative insights) and \"experiments with beauty\" (a values-driven narrative approach).\nFinancial Plan\n\nCreate tiered offerings:\nFree/low-cost digital tools or templates for individuals.\nPremium workshops and retreats for organizations.\nA long-term subscription model for teams to access ongoing coaching or data visualization dashboards.\nLegacy Projects\n\nBuild a tool for AI-assisted reflective alignment—helping individuals take pride in their work by uncovering blind spots and enhancing their outputs.\nWrite a book or create a documentary: \"My Experiments with Beauty\", capturing your journey, philosophy, and the stories of transformation you’ve facilitated.\nLanding Page Concept\nTitle:\nAwaken Alignment.

Set three measurable goals that excite you and align with your values.\nThree Deep Questions to Revise This Plan\nWhat would your \"memory crystal\" reveal about the heart of your work—both its beauty and its blind spots—and how can you use this to design a life you’re proud of?\nIf you imagined yourself thriving in January 2025, what would your work, your tools, and your relationships look like? What steps today bring you closer to that vision?\nWhat’s one bold experiment—whether a workshop, a tool, or a story—you could create this year that would define your legacy and light you up?\nLet me know which parts of this resonate or where you’d like to dive deeper!\n\n10:24\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n1. memory crystal might show that i'm interested in seeing the divine light shine through people making them beautiful and their actions too and being surprised and inspired rather than to see what I expect \"good\" looks like. I like seeing people alive. \n2. I would have more experiences with my work where I feel like I'm leaving somethng behidn that touches people in the way they would be in my workshops, I'd be making more money that I'm proud of, I think sales would make me happy, of a book or a software, or something like that that isn't my time/workshop. Maybe i could finish my book, how would you revise my book on barakanomics given what we talked about so I don't go too broad and make it unreadable while not boxing myself into a here's a step by step approach that doesn't include transformation? \n3. moving to spain and joining La fonda? Or maybe finding another co-founder, or asking Pascal to work/collab on a project? Ask for Paris money/jobs with Learning Planet Institute? Maybe spend time finding the people that inspire me the most and finding ways to spend more itme with them? \n\nCan you come up with who/where/what would I be doing that will bring me to live, satisfy my career needs, and what problem am i solving for them - what ideas/frameworks do they take away that provides value and pitch me to me and them\n10:24\nChatGPT\n\n### **Bilal’s Career Direction and Next Steps** #### **1. You’re a Bridge Between Depth and Practicality** The reflection on your “memory crystal” reveals that your true value lies in helping others recognize their unique beauty and creative potential, guiding them to create in ways that they might not have imagined possible. This is about **celebrating the vitality in others**, not projecting an idealized form of success or ‘good’. Your models should inspire—by seeing people **alive**, active, and connected to their inner light. #### **2. Crafting and Refining Your Book (Barakanomics)** - **Revised Focus:** Aim for a **book that balances broad, transformative ideas** with **practical applications**. Focus on **broad principles**, but within them, provide **small, but powerful action steps**. The idea is to leave people inspired while still giving them the tools to start their journey. **Humanize the approach** to avoid feeling stiff or overly “step-by-step,” and emphasize **self-reflection**, choice, and agency. The book should emphasize **what you can become, not just what you can do**. - **Key Proposition:** The economic system should facilitate us to **be more human**, to **feel connected**, and to maximize the “gifts” we all uniquely bring to the table—this should come through as an evolving idea rather than a static blueprint. #### **3. Aligning Your Career with Personal and Financial Fulfillment** After reflecting on your career's trajectory, here’s a plan to satisfy your career, personal growth, and financial needs, connecting with **the right problems and audiences**: --- #### **Who Are You Serving?** - **Ideal Audiences:** - **Innovative action-takers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)**: Social entrepreneurs, startup founders, young creators—people pushing boundaries but needing resilience and alignment frameworks for growth. - **Human-scaled organizations**: Think impact-driven startups or nonprofits that aren’t merely profit-driven but value authenticity and transformation. - **Corporate Leaders Challenging Efficiency Norms**: Specifically HR departments or innovation labs looking for novel pathways to boost team resilience, human well-being, and creativity while rethinking performance metrics. #### **What Problem Do You Solve?** - **For Entrepreneurs**: You help them **realign with their deeper purpose** in the business world, so that they **don’t burn out** but rather grow interconnectedly, pulling from the divine creativity within them. You help them **rediscover beauty** both in their work and in their people, ensuring their businesses thrive because they are resilient not just efficient. - **For Corporate Leaders or HR**: You provide a way to **rehumanize the workplace**. In an age when AI and productivity tools are transforming businesses, you help leaders maintain teams’ **alignment with personal creativity** and **mental well-being**, preventing AI from being used only to generate profits but **to boost individual and team growth** to its highest, most authentic potential. - **For Every Audience**: You **guide people towards self-reflection**, helping them navigate AI’s growth in ways that **encourage deeper alignment with their gifts and purposes**, **bossing up** with AI instead of relying on it as a crutch. --- #### **Your Ideas/Frameworks to Offer** - **AI-Powered Alignment + Human Creativity**: Workshop and tools where **reflection is magnified** by AI rather than replaced by it. For instance, a system where AI **asks questions** to guide creativity instead of just generating \"done work\"—helping participants delve into **their blind spots** and **transform** their projects with care, depth, and beauty. - **Memory Crystal Career Gravesight:** A tool or workshop that helps individuals **see their career story backward**—projecting their legacy given their actions today by helping them visualize key moments, contributions, and gifts that marked their progress. - **Resilience Framework for Entrepreneurs**: How to stay connected spiritually, emotionally, and creatively as their ventures grow. **Post-traumatic growth pathways** from failure, struggles, and resilience-based foundations. --- ### **Pitch to You and Others** #### **Pitch for Entrepreneurs and Foundations** “You’re walking a fragile path, **juggling the weight of expectations, limitations, and burnout.** But what if you could **realign** with the deeper purpose underneath your ambition? My workshops take you beyond productivity, uncovering the **creative beauty** behind your struggle and fostering a resilient team capable of long-term innovation. Together, let’s build a memory you will be proud of.” #### **Pitch for Corporate and HR** “I can help you **re-enter humanity** in the midst of all the AI and automation efficiencies your business is pursuing. You want stronger teams—teams that **care deeply** about their work and connect authentically. What if you could **blow up old metrics**, focusing instead on making your team **feel healthy, connected, and purpose-driven**? That’s where I come in—to lead your transformation from the inside out.” #### **Pitch for Investors/Partners (e.g., book publishing or collaborations with Learning Planet or Fonda)**: “Are you looking for the next big conversation on transformation and well-being? Visionary thinkers in the MENA and globally are primed for a book on the intersection of human resilience, AI, purpose, and creating a business model that considers the **collective good**. In addition, my workshops could establish profound foundations globally, rejuvenating the current system.” --- ### **Plan for January 24-31, 2024** - **January 24:** Reflect deeply on your story: **What have you accomplished and learned**, and where did that learning show up in the lives of those you’ve worked with? Curate those stories into usable metrics that confirm the impact of your work thus far. - **January 25:** Map out your **“AI-powered reflective tools”** in more detail, defining pragmatic outcomes (e.g. better creativity, deeper engagement) and write them up as workshops or tools. - **January 26:** Develop the **“memory crystal dashboard” to track individual and organizational team growth**. Create two versions: One for entrepreneurs and one for corporate HR departments. - **January 27:** Collaborate or research best tools for **AI and human creativity alignment**. Reach out to possible collaborators like Pascal or organizations already working with AI and see if they might help you prototype your ideas. - **January 28-29:** Dive into your **long-term book idea**; trace the **key themes**, narrowing down the most **relevant** chapters and topics. Rework the structure of Barakanomics focusing more on **principles and values**, with less emphasis on rigid steps. - **January 30:** Refine your **landing page** to showcase upcoming workshops, books, and tools in development. Start developing partnerships and collaborations for the 2024 year (e.g., Learning Planet; Paris money/jobs). - **January 31:** Sit for **three hours of reflection**; write. Dedicate space to journal **your new year’s path**, writing affirmations and identifying the 3 breakthroughs you need for your career. --- #### **Questions to Revisit and Go Deeper With** 1. **If you could radiate one truth in corporate and startup circles, what would it be, that helps remove the mask of ‘productivity over purpose’ for everyone meeting you?** 2. **How will you know when you’ve cracked the perfect blend of AI + human creativity in your tools, and what does that success look like for the world you care about?** 3. **What is the **biggest scar of failure** you’ve carried so long in your heart—how do you transform it knowingly, this year, so the story aligns with your remembrance of what matters most?** --- Would you like to dive further into one of these paths or clarify a specific part of the plan above? for 14 seconds\nBelow is a vision of a future you’ll come alive in—one that balances your yearning for deep transformation, your desire to see the divine light in others, and your practical need to earn a living and share your gifts at scale. It addresses:\n\nWhere and with whom you could collaborate (e.g., Spain, Learning Planet Institute, Pascal, co-founders)\nHow to refine your Barakanomics book to make it accessible yet transformative\nA career path that solves real problems while letting you shine\nFollowing that is a “pitch” you can use (with some tweaking) when you talk to potential partners, funders, or communities about what you offer. It focuses on the problem you solve, the frameworks or ideas that you bring, and how they provide real value.\n\n1. A Possible Life-Giving Path\nDecide on a Core “Product” Beyond Your Time\n\nBook on Barakanomics: A structured but inviting journey into spiritual/regenerative economics.\nAI-Assisted Tool: Helps people reflect on their gifts, fosters alignment, and organizes their thinking into coherent outputs (instead of AI doing the work for them).\nModular Workshops: Short, impactful sessions (online or in-person) around post-traumatic growth, reflective AI usage, and “seeing the divine light” in everyday work.\nIdentify Collaborators and Locations That Energize You\n\nLa Fonda in Spain: If it offers a community of creatives and innovators, it could be the perfect “human-scale” environment where people appreciate depth, resilience, and mystical edges.\nLearning Planet Institute in Paris: They focus on learning innovation, open science, and community-driven change. This might resonate deeply with your emphasis on reflection and well-being.\nLocal Partners (e.g., Pascal or new co-founders): People who share your passion for blending spirituality, design thinking, and AI. It could be a small but agile team capable of turning your big ideas into structured offerings.\nDesign a Structured Yet Fluid Workflow\n\nMorning Creation: Dedicate 2 hours each day to writing or prototyping (the Barakanomics book, AI tool, or workshop outlines).\nCommunity Afternoons: Networking, calls, or co-working sessions with partners who can keep you accountable and expand your perspective.\nRegular Reflection: Schedule weekly personal “memory crystal” reviews: gather small data points, stories, and aha moments from your workshops or user feedback. This keeps you motivated and in touch with your deeper why.\nRefining the Barakanomics Book\n\nAnchor in Personal Stories: Open each chapter with a real-life anecdote (from your own experiments or from others) that crystallizes a key concept.\nOffer Gentle Frameworks: At the end of each chapter, include a short reflection or “experiment with beauty,” guiding readers to integrate ideas without rigid step-by-step instructions.\nMaintain Mystical Depth Without Overwhelm: Pick 3–5 core principles (e.g., humility, generosity, balance, gratitude, alignment with the divine) and weave them throughout as recurring themes.\nAdd Visual Elements: Create simple “memory crystals” or data snapshots (e.g., graphs, doodles, mind maps) to show how these principles come to life in practice.\n2. What Problem Are You Solving?\nProblem: In a hyper-competitive, AI-driven world, individuals and teams often feel disconnected from deeper meaning. Traditional approaches to productivity and “innovation” can lead to burnout or superficial results. Many are missing the spark of genuine alignment—where heart, mind, and spirit converge to create lasting value.\n\nSolution: Your work provides a pathway (through workshops, tools, writing, and frameworks) that reconnects people to their own inner resources, fosters a sense of awe and purpose, and harnesses technology (like AI) to enhance rather than replace human creativity. You help them quantify (in ways that matter) the richness of their personal and collective growth—what you call “memory crystals.”\n\n3. The Ideas & Frameworks You Offer\n“See, Feel, Do”\nA design-thinking-inspired approach that also taps into emotional and spiritual intelligence. It encourages people to:\n\nSee what’s truly happening (beyond surface assumptions)\nFeel what resonates in their hearts, forming authentic motivations\nDo creative experiments that bring positive change\nPost-Traumatic Growth & Reflective AI\n\nPTG: Techniques to transform adversity into resilience and deeper insight, especially relevant for teams facing uncertainty.\nAI Tools: Reorient AI from a “replacement” mentality toward a “reflection” mentality—helping individuals see their strengths, articulate their ideas, and feel more ownership over the work.\nBarakanomics\n\nA spiritual/regenerative economic framework emphasizing baraka (blessing, expansion, abundance rooted in alignment with the divine).\nEncourages ethical decision-making, communal wealth, ecological awareness, and personal growth as key success metrics.\nMemory Crystals\n\nA fresh spin on measurement: blending numbers and stories to preserve the essence of each milestone.\nVisible proof that can spark gratitude, pride, and continued commitment.\n4. Example “Pitch” (To Yourself and to Potential Partners)\n**“Hi, I’m Bilal Ghalib. I help individuals and organizations discover a deeper sense of purpose and connection, especially in a rapidly changing, AI-driven world. Through workshops, reflective tools, and my Barakanomics framework, I guide people to ‘see, feel, and do’ in ways that spark true innovation and heart-centered growth.\n\nWe use AI not to replace human creativity but to enhance it—helping participants form ‘memory crystals’ of their journey, both quantitative and qualitative, that keep them aligned with what truly matters. The result? Resilient teams, empowered individuals, and a new economic story that centers on ethical, regenerative practices.\n\nI’ve worked with diverse communities—post-traumatic growth workshops in Gaza, design thinking for marginalized groups, and AI reflection tools for creative teams—always with the same goal: help people come alive and create enduring impact. If you’re an organization or a community seeking this kind of alignment, I’d love to co-create with you.”**\n\n5. A Plan for January to Launch This New Chapter\nJan 24\nRetrospective & Story Gathering\nSpend a focused morning combing through old workshop notes, emails, participant feedback. Extract key “ah-ha” stories that illustrate how your approach impacted real people. Begin a Memory Crystal Document.\nJan 25\nDraft Barakanomics Chapter Sketches\nOutline 3–5 core principles (e.g., humility, generosity, balance, gratitude, alignment). For each principle, choose a personal story and a real-world story from your retrospective.\nJan 26\nAI Tool Conceptualization\nSketch a wireframe or flowchart for how your reflective AI tool might prompt users to generate their own text. Start small. (If time: record a short Loom video explaining your concept.)\nJan 27\nLanding Page Update\nMerge the new stories, your pitch, and “memory crystal” language onto a simple website or Notion page. Make it scannable, inviting, and anchored in the fresh stories you gathered.\nJan 28\nCo-Founder/Collab Outreach\nReach out to Pascal or potential collaborators to discuss your AI tool or workshop series. Also research La Fonda in Spain and Learning Planet Institute. Send short, compelling intro emails that reference your new pitch.\nJan 29\nBook Focus Day\nSpend a block of hours fleshing out a single “Barakanomics” chapter. Incorporate at least one memory crystal from your retrospective. End the day with a quick read-through to see if it feels coherent and inspiring.\nJan 30\nAI Reflection Beta Testing\nIf feasible, test a rudimentary version of your AI reflection prompts with a few friends or past workshop participants. Gather feedback on clarity, engagement, and sense of ownership.\nJan 31\nAlignment & Future Vision\nHost a private “alignment session” for yourself. Revisit your memory crystals, track how the week went, and finalize February’s plan. Decide if you’ll invest more time in seeking corporate leads, or double down on community-driven, mission-aligned groups.\n6. Three Deep Questions to Inspire Revision\nWhat part of you still resists “measuring” success, and how can you integrate that resistance to maintain authenticity while creating structures that sustain you?\nIs there a place or group of people that consistently energizes you, and how can you intentionally spend more time with them to refine and test your ideas?\nIf you imagine an ideal day in 2025—where your book is out, your AI tool has a user base, and you’re earning sustainably—how do you feel in that scenario, and what small decisions right now move you closer to that feeling?\nFinal Note\nThis plan, pitch, and reflection aren’t about fitting yourself into someone else’s box—they’re about crystallizing (literally, in memory crystals!) what already makes you shine and taking the steps to share it with the world in a way that’s fulfilling, financially sustainable, and true to your vision of divine-inspired aliveness in people and their actions.",

I'm taking 15 milligrams of Adderall and my qualia from the Neurohacker Collective, just trying to stay positive and upbeat. And maybe it's the end of the year, maybe it's the fact that crypto is zipping and I never know when to sell, because I haven't figured out how to deal with taxes, and I don't really want to sell, and I don't really want to buy, I don't want to even look at it, and I don't really want to think about money, and I need to apply for a job, and I think I have a good prospect at the due school, but I don't want to ever get a job, because I'm not the kind of person that works for other people. I always have my own projects, and I work for myself, and it would be the first time, and I'd like you to sort of come up with 10 questions, work sort of like a mix between a coach and a psychoanalyst, and help me really reflect and think about my life, and the end of the year, it's December 23rd, 2024, and I'm feeling like the whole world is sort of falling apart, this war has kind of been going on, and I just feel a little bit uneasy in all sorts of ways, and I don't really have a job right now, or work, I have a little bit of money, but who even knows what money is, I don't know if I should be buying gold or silver, or what exactly, and I'm walking with my baby, and he's cute, and yesterday was my wife's birthday, and I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm having a hard time. Can you help me think through these things, and other things, you know, like I haven't really worked on my publication for my paper, and there's all these things that I just wish I was better at, but I'm not, and I'm getting old, and I don't really have time for working out, and my family's far away, and I don't know if I'm holding my application well, and my sheikh in Gambia, my teacher, spiritual master, has told me to always have a question of God, or a positive impression of God, and I'm struggling to do that. Can you tell me what to think, can you help me think through these things, go by questions, and try to help me understand, and find a better way forward?”\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, especially with so much on your mind. Let's take a step back and approach this one piece at a time. How about we start with a few reflective questions to help you gain clarity?\n\nWhat specific aspects of your life are causing you the most stress right now?\nWhen you think about your ideal work situation, what does it look like?\nHow can you incorporate small moments of joy or peace into your day?\nWhat support systems or resources can you lean\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, Habibi? Yeah, so one, I think the most amount of stress is sort of like just feeling like I'm far from my family, that I don't really know about money and like what to do with my financial situation because the whole world seems topsy-turvy, and I guess I, you know, like, it'll be okay. I have this small business called Noor Creative Studios, it barely makes any money. I spend a lot of money on like ambitious things and hopes and dreams, and like I'll just spend all my money on an assistant to go help me, you know, be more productive and more focused, and then, you know, it doesn't necessarily solve all my problems, and my assistant is, you know, like a young junior person with bad English, and it's just not exactly the best kind of support for me because I can't afford the really expensive assistants and coaches, and I don't even have money coming in right now. I just finished a contract with the UN, they didn't really get me any new jobs, and I don't really like the fact that, you know, a lot of my self-worth and happiness comes from like, oh, I got a new job, yay, or like, oh, look at my bank account, it's got money in it, yay, but also I know that I have some obligations to my baby and my wife, and I want to be a good husband. Basically, I don't know, like, this happens quite regularly, I just feel low and down because I think I have a bit of a maybe depressive attitude or mindset, like it's been very common in my life that I just kind of feel low periodically, maybe even associated with the changing of the seasons and stuff like that, and this is not that uncommon, but I did find some mushrooms, which is nice, okay, I found a bunch of oysters, cool.”\n09:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nI'm sorry you're feeling this way. It's understandable that all these factors are overwhelming. It's great that you're recognizing these feelings and seeking ways to address them.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFamily and Distance: It's natural to feel the strain of being away from loved ones. Staying connected through regular calls or messages can help, even if it's just for a short time.\n\nFinancial Uncertainty: It's challenging to manage finances during uncertain times. Maybe a financial advisor or simple budgeting can bring more clarity and peace of mind.\n\nCareer and Projects: It's clear you have a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Perhaps focusing on the aspects of Noor Creative Studios that align with your passions could help you find renewed motivation.\n\nSelf-worth and Success: It's important to remember that your value isn't defined by job titles or financial status. Your efforts in being a good husband and father are significant.\n\nMental Health: Recognizing when you need support is a sign of strength. If these feelings persist, professional help could be beneficial.\n\nSpiritual Guidance: Your spiritual master's advice is valuable; try finding small daily moments of gratitude.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help and take things one step at a time. You're doing your best, and that's enough.\n\n09:50\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“OK, what are some other questions that you can get to try to help me find financially deeper?”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nSure, here are a\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“issues.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nSure, here are a few more reflective questions:\n\nWhat are the core values that guide your decisions, and how can you align your current situation with them?\nWhat small, achievable steps can you take today to move closer to your goals?\nHow do you define success for yourself, beyond external measures like money or job titles?\nWhat activities or hobbies bring you genuine joy and fulfillment, and how can you incorporate them more into your life?\nWhat are some past challenges you've overcome, and what strengths did you draw on to get through them?\nReflecting on these might help you uncover deeper insights and find a path forward.\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“In the past, you know, I just kind of go try to force myself to be patient and just bear through it, but I don't really have like a positive interpretation of those moments. They're mostly just like grit your teeth and move forward and kind of, you know, understand that they'll change. But I feel like maybe my mind has just a negative orientation more than normal. It's I see it in my grandfather. I see it in my mom and like, you know, I try to get a little bit of an up boost feeling from my Adderall and from drinking a lot of tea or coffee, just trying to get this, you know, sense of positivity. And then when I have that, I can then have a pretty good day. But it just seems exogenous and I'm wondering if I should just go cold turkey. You know, I also have ADD and so I wonder if these things are related, you know, like ADD and people. I'm curious if you have any statistics and insights as to what happens when people with ADD hit their 40s, which is what's going to be happening with me next year and kind of what's the standard expected feelings and behaviors of wasted potential and all of that. Like I can imagine wasted potential and feeling like what am I doing in my life? And I just don't really understand how to manage my mind and I should be old enough. I should have figured this out by now and all that kind of stuff can be pretty standard. And if that's the standard, how can I be non-standard? What can I do that would be slightly different? And if I know what is supposed to happen because I'm just an average person just like everybody else and I can expect these things, what can I do or feel or say or think or start working on to respond differently to the same sort of conditions that someone with ADHD and potentially mild depression and a lot of potential and travel internationally and a lot of friends and live far away from his family and as parents age, I'm sure there's no doubt that's going to happen to you in this part of your life because parents age, you know what I mean? So what are the things that are standard happenings and what are some of the best responses that someone can do to prepare for and anticipate these things and just have a different response because I just don't want to be the average person who's surprised by the death of his parents or aging or sickness. Like that's kind of obvious. So let's see what we can do in advance and so that we can live a life without regret.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nIt sounds like you're being incredibly introspective, which is a great step. Here are a few more questions and thoughts that might help:\n\nHow can you redefine patience not just as enduring but as an opportunity for growth?\nWhat are some small, daily practices that could help shift your mindset towards positivity?\nWhat unique strengths do you bring to your situation that can help you navigate these challenges?\nHow can you create a support system that helps you manage ADHD and mild depression more effectively?\nWhat steps can you take now to prepare for the inevitable changes like aging parents, so you feel more in control?\nHow can you leverage your experiences and network to find new opportunities that align with your goals and passions?\nRemember, taking small steps and seeking support can make a big difference. It's okay to explore different approaches and find what works best for you.\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, you know, I was hoping that you could look into my chat history and then come up with a theory of mind for me. Look into my entire context window and try to make your best guess assumptions. Make a theory of mind table and see how that mind would interface with these challenges. And then give your explanation for how and why you believe these various things about Bilal, the person that you're talking with right now.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nWhile I can't explicitly create a \"theory of mind\" table, I can summarize what I've gathered from our conversations. You seem to be an introspective, ambitious individual with a deep desire for meaningful work and personal growth. You value family, creativity, and self-improvement. Challenges with ADHD and managing periods of low mood seem to influence your perspective, making you reflective about how to navigate life’s challenges.\n\nYour approach to difficulties appears to involve patience and perseverance, though you're seeking more proactive and positive strategies. You're curious about how to prepare for future challenges, especially those that might feel inevitable, like aging parents.\n\nTo respond differently to life's challenges, perhaps focusing on proactive mental health strategies, building strong support systems, and staying aligned with your core values could be beneficial.\n\nIs there any specific area you'd like to delve deeper into?\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I kind of want you to act like a coach and actually help me through things rather than just tell me some broad and generic advice.”\n09:58\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nGot it. Let's focus on some specific steps together.\n\nFirst, let’s identify a small, manageable goal for today. What is one thing you can do that might bring you closer to your career or personal goals?\n\nFor instance, if you want to work on job prospects, maybe updating your resume or reaching out to a contact is a good start. If it's about your personal well-being, perhaps setting aside 10 minutes for a relaxing activity could help.\n\nLet's take it one step at a time. What would you like to focus on first?\n\n09:58\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n09:58\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nTake your time.\n\n09:58\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think I first want to know exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing, and I'd like kind of maybe a psycho-spiritual understanding of my situation before getting into the practical stuff of, oh, I want to have a career goal, because I don't even know what my career goals are, you know? I think this is one of the things that happens to me a lot is I just get in my own way, you know? I overthink things, and my parents say that I'm too complicated, and it could be related to all of the stuff about, you know, I read so much but do so little, and I feel like I have a lot to share based on my life experience and reading and full contemplation, but not a lot of things to show for it, including like feeling like I can explain my career to somebody and have them know how to hire me, for instance. You really have to know me very well, and you have to kind of push me into a situation to say, hey, you could do this. Why don't you do this? We need somebody to run this workshop, which is what happened recently with Nihal when he asked me to run a, you know, Design for and with Marginalized Communities workshop, and I think, you know, there's other things, stuff coming up today, like I'm supposed to be working on this book. I paid a lot of money to take a course on, you know, publishing a book because I know I need the support and the encouragement and the backing and the pushing, but by now, it is like I have a few hours until our biweekly session, and I've done nothing because I was traveling and working on other things, and I had this workshop, and I didn't do any writing, and maybe I should do writing today of any kind just to get this organized and prepared, so maybe that's what I should actually be doing.”\n09:59\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nUnderstanding the \"why\" behind your actions can be really powerful. You seem to have a deep desire to share your knowledge and experiences but struggle with translating that into tangible outcomes. This could be a mix of perfectionism, overthinking, and perhaps a fear of not meeting your own high standards.\n\nIt's important to remember that small, consistent actions often lead to greater progress than waiting for the perfect moment. Perhaps your psycho-spiritual journey is about balancing your thirst for knowledge with compassionate self-discipline.\n\nTo start, maybe set a simple intention: write for just 10 minutes today, without worrying about the outcome. Embrace the process and trust that each step you take is valuable. How does that sound?\n\n09:59\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“That sounds good, except I often use audio recording because I'm really good at talking and less good at sitting down and writing. I talk, and I write, and I actually produce a lot of text, but it just seems insurmountable and they go really wide, because I'm a really curious and diverse person. My interests just go really wide and become not very practical. It goes from, like, okay, here's how you can create a sustainable business that follows aesthetic principles and how this is a beautiful thing to do, and then at some point I'm talking about epistemology and ontology and the view of Muslims on the world and how we can redefine and reaccess this more psycho-mystical, open, unitarian, oneness perspective and how that will then influence how we start businesses. And it's just like, who's going to read and think and understand these things versus who's going to be able to just say, okay, so first step, have a good intention for your business. But it's like, I'd rather work on the deepest root causes rather than the end results of the fruits, and that makes it so that I get really broad and really, you know, I start talking about all sorts of things rather than, you know, some of the more immediate, at-hand practical stuff. And I wonder if, you know, like, when I write and I just have this stuff, I just look at it later and I'm like, okay, this is one book, this is two books, this is four books, this is how many different ideas are here. And so, you know, I don't have a problem with writing or producing content, I have a problem with, like, thinking about other people reading it and picking an audience and all of that stuff because I actually don't want to do that. Like, picking an audience and trying to come up with, like, a marketable book and this idea of, like, it's prepackaged, easy to digest something that just feels like it will be inauthentic. And then I realize that that's why I'm, like, poor and confusing and nobody understands me and no one knows how to hire me and I feel like I'm, like, rich with insight and ideas and I just do way too many different diverse things that are not adding up. And every time I try to even just do one thing that I can try to create and share, it becomes a huge, like, worldview that people have to get in and involved in and how can I bring these things together? You know, like, there's this guy, Baraka Blue, he has this Rumi-centered courses and he just does, like, reads Rumi and then asks people for their reflections and he holds space and people think of him as, you know, the poet guy who has these courses on mysticism and it's really clear. Like, if you want a course on Islamic mysticism and you're going to do it in a poetic way with a beautiful community, good aesthetics, all that, just go to, like, Baraka Blue and look at what he's doing. If you want, you know, Islamic economics and alternative views on how Muslims view economics, you can go to Ady Atiyah and take his courses, you know? And for me, it's like, I don't have a team, I don't have a PhD, I don't have consistency in anything that I've done. I've done robotics, I've done, you know, startup support and, you know, I'm now, like, working on this kind of worldview, mystic kind of interpretation that will define how we look at businesses to make them more sustainable, but that's not the goal. It's important not to have a goal, it's important to have a different way of seeing nature as a place where, you know, you can see the signs of God and then how does that change, you know, natural resources into things that you are much more respectful of and gentle with, including people, instead of human resources in a human resource department. What about, like, these people as people, as beautiful humans that you want to help them find their contribution? And that can be what a human resource department does, and I just think very broadly and diversely and confusingly, and it's also part of my journey, too, right? Like, I started very practically, I started with, like, open-source technology for good, you know, how can we use these tools that people are using to build rail and stuff to build good stuff? And then I had the idea of making my own showcase of these kinds of good things, and so I started my own projects, like the Awareness Project, when car bombs go off and it would crush a sculpture using an Arduino and send a tweet to people who promised to do good things whenever bad things happened, and it was to try to, you know, demonstrate how we can play with technology to be more positively responsive to the challenges of the world, to see the pain globally, but to act locally, and not to get overwhelmed with everything you can do, but to do something about one cause that you care about. And I have all these ideas, and I've built all these things, and I even thought to myself, like, oh, let's try to talk to ChatGPT differently and all this AI stuff and use our pen and paper and, like, write to them long form so that we can't copy and paste, so that we're more involved with our manual connection, and I made this app, and I just put it online at cursiveGPT.com, and nobody cares, because I don't market it, and I don't share it, and then how does that connect to anything else that I'm doing? And it's so messy, and, like, who the heck am I? What is this? Am I, like, a Renaissance man that nobody cares about, that when I die, people are like, oh, yeah, he had some interesting ideas, let's retrospectively write a book and honor this random person, but instead of, during my life, when I actually need work and a job and coherence and meaning and a story, like, what other characters in history were like this? You know, like, at least Benjamin Franklin, he had some jobs, you know, and, like, he made money, and I just, maybe this is connected to my whole, like, this taste with money thing, where I'm like, oh, yeah, you know, I don't really want money, dah, dah, dah, whatever, like, don't pay me too much, I just want to get it, like, accidentally in the side where someone actually sends it into my bank account where it's not connected to the stuff I do, and I'm not sure how I can possibly have a career thinking and behaving like that, but I think it's connected to my worldview, and until my worldview changes, I'm not sure I'll be able to fix that. Can you give, like, a breakdown, an analysis of how these things are all interconnected and maybe a path forward? Well, there you have it.”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nYou have a rich and expansive mind that thrives on exploring complex ideas. This desire to dive deeply into diverse topics is a strength, but it can also make it challenging to create focused, practical outputs that resonate with a specific audience.\n\nYour inclination towards exploring root causes and deeper meanings reflects a holistic worldview. However, the challenge lies in translating these broad insights into tangible, actionable forms that others can easily grasp and utilize.\n\nTo bridge this gap, consider focusing on one core idea at a time, making it accessible without losing its depth. It's okay to have a broad perspective, but channeling that into focused projects might help others better connect with your ideas.\n\nThink of it as creating \"entry points\" for others to engage with your broader vision. It might also help to collaborate with others who can support and complement your strengths, turning your diverse insights into cohesive, impactful projects.\n\nHow does that sound to you?\n\n10:00\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“I think you could do better. Go a little deeper and try to understand like maybe the psychology that connects across these different, both pros and cons, like what exactly is happening in my mind and how do they actually result in both of these things.”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour mind seems to operate like a vast, interconnected web, constantly seeking to integrate diverse concepts and ideas. This depth and breadth are part of your strengths, but they can also make it challenging to focus and produce concise, targeted outputs.\n\nPsychologically, this might stem from a combination of high curiosity, a desire for authenticity, and perhaps an aversion to oversimplification or commercialization. You value depth and authenticity over surface-level engagement, which makes you resistant to traditional \"packaging\" of ideas.\n\nThis approach can sometimes lead to a sense of being \"spread too thin\" or feeling misunderstood because your broad scope can be hard for others to immediately grasp.\n\nTo bring these strengths together:\n\nGround your ideas in tangible examples: Start with the deep concepts but find ways to anchor them in practical, relatable stories or applications.\nIterative sharing: Break down your broad ideas into smaller pieces that can be shared incrementally, inviting engagement and feedback.\nFinding your \"why\": Reconnect with your core motivation—why you are passionate about these topics and how they connect to your life's purpose.\nEmbracing this approach might help you bring coherence to your diverse interests and make your work more accessible and impactful.\n\n10:00\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, OK. Can you give me a step-by-step approach for how to do that and turn it into a career path?”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let’s break it down into actionable steps:\n\nIdentify a Core Theme: Choose one central idea or theme that resonates most with you. This could be something like integrating spiritual insights into business or sustainable practices.\n\nCreate Entry Points: Develop smaller, digestible content or projects that align with this theme. For example, start with a blog series, short videos, or workshops that introduce these ideas in a practical way.\n\nEngage and Iterate: Share these smaller pieces with your network or a target audience. Gather feedback and refine your approach based on what resonates most.\n\nBuild a Narrative: Craft a coherent story around your core theme, linking your diverse interests into a unified narrative. This will help others see the connections between your ideas.\n\nEstablish Consistency: Consistency doesn’t mean limiting your curiosity but creating regular, predictable content or sessions that people can rely on, like a weekly blog or monthly workshop.\n\nCollaborate and Network: Partner with others who can help bring your ideas\n\n10:00\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, okay. I was thinking about the work that we've done together based on the context window and the history that you know. Like, the workshop I did on post-traumatic growth with people from Gaza, Palestine. The workshop I just did recently with Nihal. And, you know, am I like a workshop giver? Like, answer all of these questions for yourself and then come up with a, I don't know, like a landing page and read it out to me. Describing this really awesome guy who has great experience and is super valuable. And actually like, oh, you just read his website and you want to hire him and you know exactly what for. And it's like marketable and hireable skills for today. You know, as the world gets more closed, as more countries are not opening their borders. As people think of the world as getting more difficult and where the, you know, ecology is kind of collapsing as well. And we worry about the future. So, given all of that, what is the still hireable job? There's still corporations, but like everyone is worried these days. You know, like, what are we going to, what are we going to do? And I should still be someone that people want to hire. So, what is that kind of pitch? And, you know, think of my website and what are the different sections? And you can talk about my previous talks, but they're also different and so old now. I also have had about 10 years where I was kind of like head down working on gloom.pm. And it was just kind of focusing on working in Lebanon and trying to be smaller and more humble. And, you know, like I didn't want to be this big shot, like traveling the world and making positive change or whatever. So, that kind of led to me being irrelevant and kind of quiet and hard to even see.

For instance, having check-ins, for instance, where we include deliberate rumination questions. And I want it all to be also explainable, so that it's a part of our mind and our heart, rather than just our mind. And maybe we can reconnect to this idea of like, see, feel, do again. See the world, let it affect how you feel, and then what are you going to do about it. And you know, there's so much seeing of things with social media, and I really feel like there's a place for craft, and like connecting with quiet and solitude, and this place where things emerge. But I also would like you to kind of take a perspective from like a corporate leader's HR department, you know, like looking at a roster of different things to do. Like they can ask me like, okay, well, what's your track record? What's your impact? And all I can say is, I don't know, people like thank me after my workshops. And like, what's the point, right? Like, what's the point if it doesn't make businesses money, or make their teams more efficient, or any of these things? What if it just like makes people want to quit, you know? It's not going to be a great pitch for HR departments.

So help me change my mind, like look at it from a critique critic's perspective, look at it from a logical perspective, go through line by line, idea by idea, and just help me try to change my mind, even about one element, you know? Like maybe it is also about when people are young, they just need to do something, right? Something that is obviously good, rather than something abstractly good. And the obviously good thing could be like, okay, let's work on SDGs, and it's a cool project, and you know, changex.org, where you just do and copy, connect the dots, and you know, one of the things that I've never done is like work in a corporate environment, like I don't have that experience, I'm like, I can't even manage myself well, how am I going to be telling people about anything, if I don't have like the background and experience, like I'm almost 40, and I have no like giant success story, I built this business called bloom.pm, that it's not even making money, and I'm gonna just have it go away, because the funding in the Middle East has changed and stopping, like what am I supposed to say about my story that's exciting?

Without concrete metrics—like increased revenue, retention rates, or efficiency—it's difficult for HR departments to justify your approach. 'People thanked me' doesn’t hold up in a boardroom.\"\nAbstract and Intangible Outcomes:\n\n\"Your emphasis on well-being and rumination is too abstract for corporate environments. Businesses prioritize clear, actionable outcomes. If your workshops lead people to quit because they realize they don’t like their jobs, why would a company hire you?\"\nWeak Track Record:\n\n\"You don't have a history of working in corporate environments or a major success story to point to. How can you claim to understand corporate needs when you've never been in that context?\"\nOverly Philosophical Approach:\n\n\"The 'see, feel, do' framework and ideas about craft and solitude are inspiring, but they lack direct applicability in fast-paced environments. Businesses need immediate, scalable solutions, not reflective journeys.\"\nPotentially Disruptive Outcomes:\n\n\"If your methods lead to employees rethinking their lives, it could create disengagement rather than improved performance. How does this serve organizational goals?\"\nLack of Alignment with Business Goals:\n\n\"Your work doesn’t align with traditional business metrics like productivity, profitability, or innovation. Without a clear business case, your workshops could be seen as a waste of resources.\"\nPerception of Personal Inadequacy:\n\n\"Your lack of self-confidence in managing yourself and your career trajectory could make it hard for others to trust your guidance. If Bloom struggled to make money, why should others invest in your ideas?\"\nResponse and Rebuttal\nOn Metrics:\n\nRebuttal: \"Measuring well-being and engagement is possible, and the outcomes are directly linked to organizational success. Studies show that happier, more engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and less likely to leave. I can start tracking these metrics to provide evidence.\"\nActionable Step: Develop post-workshop surveys and follow-up assessments to measure shifts in engagement, collaboration, and creativity.\nOn Abstract Outcomes:\n\nRebuttal: \"Abstract outcomes often lead to profound, long-term impacts. Companies investing in mindfulness, resilience, and psychological safety have seen significant returns.\"\nActionable Step: Frame the workshops as a way to foster creativity and resilience, directly tied to business innovation and adaptability.\nOn Weak Track Record:\n\nRebuttal: \"While I haven’t worked in a corporate environment, I’ve facilitated impactful workshops for diverse audiences. The principles I teach are universal and applicable anywhere.\"\nActionable Step: Leverage testimonials, case studies, or partnerships with organizations that can validate your work.\nOn Philosophical Approach:\n\nRebuttal: \"The 'see, feel, do' framework aligns with design thinking principles already embraced by leading companies. It provides a structured way to approach problem-solving while staying grounded in empathy and action.\"\nActionable Step: Translate philosophical ideas into clear, practical steps for immediate application in team settings.\nOn Disruptive Outcomes:\n\nRebuttal: \"Encouraging employees to reflect doesn’t mean disengagement—it means alignment. Employees who feel connected to their values and the company’s mission perform better and are less likely to burn out.\"\nActionable Step: Emphasize how your workshops align personal values with organizational goals, fostering a sense of purpose.\nOn Alignment with Business Goals:\n\nRebuttal: \"Well-being drives results. For example, Google’s Project Aristotle found that psychological safety is the number one predictor of high-performing teams. My workshops directly enhance these soft skills.\"\nActionable Step: Link workshop outcomes to metrics like team performance, innovation rates, or retention, and include these in pitches.\nOn Perception of Personal Inadequacy:\n\nRebuttal: \"Leadership isn’t about perfection but about authenticity and growth. My experiences with Bloom and beyond have given me unique insights into navigating challenges.\"\nActionable Step: Reframe your narrative: Bloom was an experiment in innovation and resilience, proving your ability to adapt and persevere in changing contexts.\nShifting Your Perspective\nYou mentioned the tension between abstractly good and obviously good actions. Perhaps there’s merit in balancing both:\n\nStart Small, Prove Impact: Focus on delivering workshops tied to specific goals like SDG alignment or team-building. These 'obviously good' projects can be easier to pitch.\nEmerge from Solitude: Your emphasis on craft and solitude is a valuable counterpoint to the noise of social media. Package this as a \"quiet leadership\" program for managers dealing with overwhelm.\nFocus on Corporate Familiarity: Partner with someone who understands corporate structures to bridge the gap between your philosophy and their needs.\nWould shifting toward more tangible outcomes while retaining your core philosophy feel authentic to you? Let me know how you'd like to refine this further!\n\n10:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nHere, can we actually respond based on what you know about me from my perspective and say things that demonstrate my growth and understanding and imply, like, what are the things I'm going to do to actually properly address the critique to improve my position in this way?\n10:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let’s address the critique from your perspective while demonstrating your growth and the steps you’ll take to address these points.\n\nResponse and Action Plan\n1. On Metrics and Measurable Impact\nYour Growth: \"I’ve realized the importance of aligning my work with measurable outcomes, not just for validation but to create a narrative that bridges personal transformation and organizational goals. My experience has taught me that qualitative impact—like the stories of personal growth from workshop participants—can and should be complemented by data.\"\nActionable Step: \"I will implement post-workshop surveys to measure changes in employee engagement, creativity, and team collaboration. I’ll follow up with organizations six months after sessions to quantify long-term outcomes.\"\n2. On Abstract and Intangible Outcomes\nYour Growth: \"I’ve learned that organizations value clarity and immediate applicability. While my approach focuses on deeper, emergent insights, I can scaffold these ideas into actionable frameworks that are easy to implement.\"\nActionable Step: \"I will translate my 'see, feel, do' philosophy into a practical toolkit, combining it with check-ins and deliberate rumination exercises tied to organizational priorities like innovation and team cohesion.\"\n3. On Track Record\nYour Growth: \"My work at Bloom has given me deep insights into resilience, innovation, and adaptability in volatile contexts. I recognize now that I need to showcase how these lessons are universally applicable, even in corporate environments.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll build case studies from Bloom and other projects, highlighting specific examples where my approach led to concrete outcomes like improved team collaboration or innovative solutions in challenging environments.\"\n4. On Philosophical Approach\nYour Growth: \"I understand now that ideas like craft, solitude, and emergence can feel abstract to some audiences. But these practices are more relevant than ever in helping organizations manage burnout and foster creativity.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll design a 'quiet leadership' module tailored for managers, focusing on how deliberate reflection and solitude can enhance decision-making and prevent burnout. This module will integrate clear deliverables like stress-reduction practices and creative problem-solving tools.\"\n5. On Potentially Disruptive Outcomes\nYour Growth: \"Reflection isn’t about disengagement—it’s about alignment. I’ve seen firsthand how connecting people to their values leads to renewed energy and commitment, both personally and professionally.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll explicitly frame my workshops as alignment tools that connect employees’ personal values with organizational goals, making teams not just more fulfilled but more effective.\"\n6. On Alignment with Business Goals\nYour Growth: \"I’ve come to understand that well-being and organizational success aren’t competing goals—they’re deeply interconnected. By focusing on psychological safety and creative capacity, my work supports key business metrics.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll integrate business-focused metrics into my pitches, such as innovation rates, retention rates, and team productivity, showing how these are enhanced through my approach.\"\n7. On Perception of Personal Inadequacy\nYour Growth: \"I’ve reflected deeply on my narrative. Bloom wasn’t a failure—it was an incubator of resilience and adaptability, teaching me how to navigate uncertainty. My value lies not in perfection but in authenticity and the lessons I’ve learned through experimentation.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll reframe my story as one of continuous growth, positioning myself as someone who thrives in ambiguity and helps others do the same. I’ll also identify specific areas for personal improvement, like partnering with a mentor who has corporate experience to deepen my understanding of that space.\"\nNext Steps to Solidify Your Position\nDevelop a New Portfolio: Create a portfolio that clearly outlines your workshops, their methodologies, and measurable impacts.\nPilot a Corporate Program: Run a small-scale workshop with a corporate team, gather feedback, and refine the approach to better align with their needs.\nNetwork Strategically: Partner with someone who has corporate experience to co-facilitate or consult on bridging your approach with corporate language and priorities.\nRevisit Bloom: Use your experience at Bloom as a living case study, focusing on the skills and insights gained rather than the financial challenges.\nBy addressing these critiques through actionable changes, you’ll not only strengthen your position but also align your values with practical, impactful results. How does this resonate with you? Would you like to focus on any particular point further?\n\n10:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, could you ask me 10 questions to get me to respond to the critique in a way that will really convince me? Because right now I'm not convinced. I really think that it sounds like I'm just capitulating to their whims and needs. What are some questions that I can reflect on that might actually help me make a real internal change so that this is not just a bunch of words?\n10:23\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nOf course! Here are ten questions designed to help you reflect deeply, challenge your assumptions, and arrive at a genuine internal shift—one that aligns with your values while addressing the critique meaningfully.\n\nWhat do you believe is the core value or essence of your work, and how could aligning with corporate needs actually amplify rather than dilute that essence?\n\nReflect on how your unique perspective can meet both your ideals and their practical concerns.\nWhat would need to change for you to feel like you're offering something transformative to corporate environments, rather than adapting to their demands?\n\nConsider what it means to bring your philosophy into a new context on your terms.\nHow might metrics and measurable outcomes not just validate your work but serve as tools for deepening your impact and improving your workshops?\n\nThink about whether measurement could be reframed as part of your reflective, iterative process.\nWhat is your reaction to the idea that people might not \"get\" your workshops if they’re too abstract? Is it your responsibility to make your ideas more accessible, or is the onus on others to stretch themselves?\n\nReflect on whether compromise is a form of connection or a betrayal of your vision.\nWhat would it take for you to see “corporate needs” not as limiting, but as a creative challenge that could evolve your work into something even greater?\n\nExplore the potential growth in engaging with an unfamiliar context.\nWhen you consider your past workshops, what are the moments or outcomes you’re most proud of, and how might you communicate those in a way that resonates with skeptics?\n\nFocus on the stories that demonstrate your impact, even if they don’t follow conventional metrics.\nWhat part of the critique feels most threatening to you, and why? Is it a challenge to your values, your confidence, or something else?\n\nIdentify the emotional core of your resistance and unpack it.\nIf you imagined working with a corporate HR team, what specific problems might they face that your approach could uniquely solve?\n\nShift the question from “how do I fit?” to “what needs am I uniquely positioned to meet?”\nWhat assumptions might you be making about corporate environments, and how could you test or challenge those assumptions?\n\nReflect on whether your critiques of corporate culture are fully accurate or need re-examining.\nIf you could co-create an entirely new framework for corporate engagement—one that feels authentic to you—what would it look like, and how would it blend both your ideals and their goals?\n\nImagine a blueprint that doesn’t compromise but instead reinvents the conversation.\nWould you like to explore any of these questions together, or do they bring to mind initial responses you’d like to share?\n\n10:24\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, so, I have, like, two ideas first. The first idea is kind of related to this thought that I had that it's not that I am against quantification, but I'm against quantifying the wrong things, and, like, maybe I could have been gathering some interesting stories and insights from my work in the past to be able to, first of all, just, like, take more pride. You know, like, quantification is visualized memory. It's like memory crystal. And when you can see it, you can be like, oh, my God. Like, if I was able to say that I helped 500 people not give up doing the things that matter to them and help them align with their intentions to do good, to share the gifts that they have in the world, like, that could be really inspiring to me. But I can't even say that because I've been so obtuse and, like, oh, no, you know, I don't want to measure. But measuring the right things could be great. So maybe this is one way we can align on that. Two is I think we need, like, an immune system for AI or, like, an AI vaccine for resolving this unseen conflict that no one is really talking about between employees trying to use artificial intelligence to kind of get away with doing less work and improve their quality without their employers knowing and employers wanting to essentially at some point use AI to replace their employees and reduce the headcount on their businesses. And, like, this is an unspoken thing. And I think there's some, like, beautiful ways to use artificial intelligence. But we're not really talking about it. We're just, you know, in these two different silos. And maybe this is one way I can work with corporate clients to identify a workshop that I can do with them. And then the other thing is maybe I shouldn't be working with corporate clients at all. Like, maybe that's the wrong question. Maybe the question for me should be something like who really could benefit from my skills and my knowledge and my expertise and the gifts that I have in terms of these types of workshops and sessions and talks and maybe even tools. You know, like, I've been thinking about making a tool based on the frameworks that we've developed for artificial intelligence where when people start asking it questions to do work for them, it can say, hold up, let me ask you some questions to show you the beauty that you have to give, you know, to help you see your blind spots, to help you see your skills and what you should be doing right now and to help you align on that and to encourage you and to coach you and to help you write and then to help you structure your writing so that your outputs are wonderful instead of just doing the writing for you and having it be this kind of garbage. You know, like, one of the interesting things that I did with AI recently was I asked it to ask me a bunch of questions to get as much of the writing done by me as possible so that it could just, you know, take the writing, cut the sentences up and organize them and structure them in a way that is coherent and clear to address the challenge. And this way, the work can be something that you're proud of because you came up with it, you did it, you know. But it was leveraging the advantage of AI in terms of being able to stay focused and on track and to answer the right question and if you ever are stuck, it can help you identify your blind spots and how other people would answer this so that your work can have a qualitative improvement. And this is something cool to use AI for. Not whatever people are doing, like here, write me a five-paragraph essay on, you know, innovation in the workplace or something. And that's a workshop that I could give. But I think the question I'm going to mirror back to you is, like, based on all the stuff that you know, should I be trying to get corporate clients? Is that the place for me to define my career? Or should I be working more with startups and individual people and people in the Middle East and North Africa and, you know, like, are these the people that would really value and appreciate the knowledge and expertise that I have, you know, with all of the post-traumatic growth frameworks How do you use AI to help people feel proud of themselves in their work rather than ashamed? And is there, like, something different that I should be doing as well in terms of, like, my self-confidence and mindset? And, you know, like, people kind of also get what they expect to get. If I tell them, like, I don't know, just a little workshop, I'll do a little thing for you, it might be helpful, it might not be. And if I instead said, like, okay, no, we're going to come up with a memory crystal, a.k.a. a data visualization, because that's what it is, you know, it takes the memory of the quantitative and qualitative feedback that people are giving and turns it into something that you can hold and it's a gem. And, you know, like, I've always been kind of opposed in some sense to gamification because I always felt like it was, like, belittling and making small and, like, the menu and people are going to just work for the menu, like, trying to get as much coins as possible and that's the problem with capitalism. It's like, oh yeah, more coins, that means good, right? And it's easy to make that simple rather than to say every day you need to check in with yourself and to think what is more good, right? And this is an insight I had a long time ago from my talk, Good is Hard, where I was talking about Fritz Haber and the guy that invented nitrogen fixing and how he was so adamant and kind of insistent on death and the thing is, he invented a thing that fed the planet and we called it good and we gave him a Nobel Prize and then there's this guy, right? Like, he invented the lobotomy, but he did it because he loved and he cared for the patients that were in his care and Edgar Moniz, right? So Edgar was like, oh, these poor people, in the case of the most extreme, most difficult situations, this is the thing that we can do to keep them safe and keep the people around them safe and he also won the Nobel Prize and both of their outputs, one looked bad very soon, one looked good very soon and then they switched and now we have a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where nothing grows because of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and for a while, lobotomies were horrible and they killed so many people and hurt so many people and this idea of like having, so this is like maybe the core issue around the measurement idea, it's like, unless you regularly come back to it and you see what your heart is telling you, looking at this memory crystal and being in constant feedback and that's the thing, I think, it's also related to all of this decentralized autonomous organizations, right? You think you know what good is and you can set it up and have this map drawn out and the lines and the waypoints, which are measurements along the way of these various things and it does a good job, it grows businesses. But at the end of the day, we want to make sure that these businesses are good and I kind of believe in a million billionaires rather than a thousand billionaires, right? So what if we had a billion millionaires instead of a million billionaires or the opposite, right? We need more people to be wealthy and to be able to dream even within the context of these organizations I feel like we can have different ways of business and that maybe it's really by doing these things and just maybe finding the core principles that will be able to direct thousands of people and to train HR staff to do these things, we can have kind of a slow growth of these philosophies that are about being and about remembering and about having these stories to be able to tell about our past that would still inspire us, right? And there's these stories that we can tell that would help people sort of understand themselves and this is kind of like the idea of the long-form autobiography, right? I kind of had this problem where when I was younger I was like, okay, when you're living, you got to imagine that you're telling your life story so let's make sure that by the end when you die you are happy with the main character and that nobody is like reading the story and be like, no, wait, why would you do that? Be angry with the main character and the thing is, I felt like that was too much self-centered and so I feel like maybe it's not an autobiography and maybe it's more like the Gandhi, my experiments with truth, right? And maybe it could be like my experiments with beauty\n10:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThank you for sharing all these ideas, reflections, and questions. Let’s approach this systematically to help clarify your direction, starting with some tailored follow-up questions that build on your reflections while challenging you to deepen your thinking and align with your true goals.\n\nQuestions to Deepen Reflection and Resolve\n1. Measurement and Memory Crystals\nWhat are the right things to measure that would genuinely inspire you and align with your values?\nHow might capturing these metrics not just validate your work to others but also give you a sense of pride and direction in your own story?\nWhat’s stopping you from starting now—reviewing past work and gathering those stories to form the memory crystal?\n2. The Corporate vs. Human Impact Question\nWhat excites you more: influencing corporate systems for incremental change or working directly with individuals or startups for transformative impact?\nIf you focus on corporations, how could you design workshops that plant seeds of beauty and transformation within a system you currently see as flawed?\nWhat would a client look like that perfectly aligns with both your values and your desire for financial sustainability?\n3. AI and Human Creativity\nHow does the idea of using AI to foster pride in work, rather than replace it, connect with your vision for beauty and storytelling in people's lives?\nWhat frameworks or tools could you create that combine your deep understanding of post-traumatic growth with AI's capacity to scaffold creativity?\nCould your proposed AI vaccine concept become an entry point to engage with corporations or a broader audience in a way that feels authentic?\n4. Reclaiming Confidence and Ownership\nWhat internal narrative keeps you from fully owning your past successes, such as Bloom or your workshops?\nHow can you reframe those stories in a way that acknowledges both the learning and the impact you’ve had?\nIf someone else had done what you’ve done—built Bloom, facilitated meaningful workshops, developed a vision for AI tools—how would you celebrate their achievements? Why is it harder to do the same for yourself?\n5. Gamification, Alignment, and Goodness\nHow might you design “good gamification”—a system that rewards reflection, connection, and alignment with values rather than just productivity?\nWhat does ‘goodness’ look like in the context of the organizations and people you want to serve? How would you help them see and feel that?\nWhat does ‘goodness’ look like in your own story, and how do you align with it in practical ways each day?\n6. Stories, Principles, and Long-Term Impact\nWhat’s the core story you want your work to tell about the world, and how does it connect with your audience’s struggles and desires?\nWhat principles guide your approach to beauty, alignment, and impact? How might these principles inform a scalable framework that could influence others?\nWhat does your \"experiments with beauty\" narrative look like, and how might sharing it empower others to run their own experiments?\n7. Audience Fit\nWho has already valued and benefited from your work the most—corporate clients, individuals, startups, or another group?\nWhich audience do you feel most inspired to serve, and why? How would serving them contribute to the larger story you want to tell about the world?\nHow might you prototype working with different audiences—corporates, startups, individual creators—so you can gather data about where you have the greatest impact?\n8. Vision Beyond Individual Impact\nIf you imagine training thousands of HR leaders, startups, or individuals, how would you ensure your philosophies grow slowly and sustainably within their systems?\nWhat kind of legacy do you want your work to leave behind for the people and organizations it touches?\nHow might the principles of decentralized organizations and autonomy help you scale your approach in a way that feels authentic and impactful?\n9. Your Relationship with Measurement\nIf you could design your ideal feedback loop—a mix of stories, metrics, and visuals—what would it look like, and how would it inspire both you and others?\nHow might regularly revisiting these \"memory crystals\" keep you aligned with your values while adapting to what the world needs?\nWhat’s one small way you could start capturing these stories and metrics today?\n10. Practical and Philosophical Alignment\nHow do you reconcile the desire to create change in flawed systems (e.g., corporate environments) with the feeling that you should work elsewhere?\nHow do you ensure that your ideas, while philosophical, are also actionable and tangible?\nWhat’s one small, “obviously good” thing you can do today that will help you build confidence in your ability to have impact while staying true to your values?\nNext Steps\nTake one or two questions that resonate most deeply with you and start journaling or discussing them further. If you'd like, I can help you unpack your responses or refine the questions into specific action steps. Which of these questions feels most urgent to explore first?\n\n10:24\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nSo, how would you imagine Bilal respond to all of the questions? And what is the advice that you would give him on the place in the world where he would actually light up to be contributing, has a good financial return, and is a good home for his ideas? Maybe we can try to make a plan for getting into those areas. And for now, we can also work on his landing page and maybe even a plan for gathering the data from all of his, you know, teams that he's worked with and kind of looking back. And it's a good time of year to do a retrospective, but at the same time, maybe come up with this idea of, like, a memory crystal dashboard career experiment with truth. I'm not exactly sure what to call it or what it would look like, but look at all of this and then come up with a plan for January 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 for me to be able to prepare myself for an awesome new year and an awesome career where, you know, given my spiritual and psychological and emotional capacity and the failures that I have in the organization, not being very corporate and struggling with, you know, consistency and motivation and to come up with a way that I can take the best and mitigate the worst and to find a place where I really thrive. And if you must, at the end, you can ask three deep and profound questions to help you revise it.\n10:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nBilal’s Response to the Questions\n1. On Measurement and Memory Crystals\nBilal realizes that resistance to measurement was not about numbers but about the fear of losing the soul of his work. He sees now that measuring the right things—such as stories of alignment, resilience, and personal growth—creates a \"memory crystal,\" a visualized narrative that honors his values while inspiring others.\n\n2. On Audience Fit\nHe reflects that his deepest impact has been on individuals, small teams, and communities in the Middle East and North Africa. These are the people who connect deeply with his post-traumatic growth frameworks, AI ideas for alignment, and the spiritual depth he brings. Corporate clients may not be his home, and that's okay.\n\n3. On AI as a Tool for Pride\nHe feels inspired to build tools and frameworks that use AI to help people rediscover their unique gifts and take pride in their work. This aligns deeply with his value of helping others uncover their beauty and blind spots.\n\n4.

I like seeing people alive. \n2. I would have more experiences with my work where I feel like I'm leaving somethng behidn that touches people in the way they would be in my workshops, I'd be making more money that I'm proud of, I think sales would make me happy, of a book or a software, or something like that that isn't my time/workshop. Maybe i could finish my book, how would you revise my book on barakanomics given what we talked about so I don't go too broad and make it unreadable while not boxing myself into a here's a step by step approach that doesn't include transformation? \n3. moving to spain and joining La fonda? Or maybe finding another co-founder, or asking Pascal to work/collab on a project? Ask for Paris money/jobs with Learning Planet Institute? Maybe spend time finding the people that inspire me the most and finding ways to spend more itme with them? \n\nCan you come up with who/where/what would I be doing that will bring me to live, satisfy my career needs, and what problem am i solving for them - what ideas/frameworks do they take away that provides value and pitch me to me and them\n10:24\nChatGPT\n\n### **Bilal’s Career Direction and Next Steps** #### **1. You’re a Bridge Between Depth and Practicality** The reflection on your “memory crystal” reveals that your true value lies in helping others recognize their unique beauty and creative potential, guiding them to create in ways that they might not have imagined possible. This is about **celebrating the vitality in others**, not projecting an idealized form of success or ‘good’. Your models should inspire—by seeing people **alive**, active, and connected to their inner light. #### **2. Crafting and Refining Your Book (Barakanomics)** - **Revised Focus:** Aim for a **book that balances broad, transformative ideas** with **practical applications**. Focus on **broad principles**, but within them, provide **small, but powerful action steps**. The idea is to leave people inspired while still giving them the tools to start their journey. **Humanize the approach** to avoid feeling stiff or overly “step-by-step,” and emphasize **self-reflection**, choice, and agency. The book should emphasize **what you can become, not just what you can do**. - **Key Proposition:** The economic system should facilitate us to **be more human**, to **feel connected**, and to maximize the “gifts” we all uniquely bring to the table—this should come through as an evolving idea rather than a static blueprint. #### **3. Aligning Your Career with Personal and Financial Fulfillment** After reflecting on your career's trajectory, here’s a plan to satisfy your career, personal growth, and financial needs, connecting with **the right problems and audiences**: --- #### **Who Are You Serving?** - **Ideal Audiences:** - **Innovative action-takers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)**: Social entrepreneurs, startup founders, young creators—people pushing boundaries but needing resilience and alignment frameworks for growth. - **Human-scaled organizations**: Think impact-driven startups or nonprofits that aren’t merely profit-driven but value authenticity and transformation. - **Corporate Leaders Challenging Efficiency Norms**: Specifically HR departments or innovation labs looking for novel pathways to boost team resilience, human well-being, and creativity while rethinking performance metrics. #### **What Problem Do You Solve?** - **For Entrepreneurs**: You help them **realign with their deeper purpose** in the business world, so that they **don’t burn out** but rather grow interconnectedly, pulling from the divine creativity within them. You help them **rediscover beauty** both in their work and in their people, ensuring their businesses thrive because they are resilient not just efficient. - **For Corporate Leaders or HR**: You provide a way to **rehumanize the workplace**. In an age when AI and productivity tools are transforming businesses, you help leaders maintain teams’ **alignment with personal creativity** and **mental well-being**, preventing AI from being used only to generate profits but **to boost individual and team growth** to its highest, most authentic potential. - **For Every Audience**: You **guide people towards self-reflection**, helping them navigate AI’s growth in ways that **encourage deeper alignment with their gifts and purposes**, **bossing up** with AI instead of relying on it as a crutch. --- #### **Your Ideas/Frameworks to Offer** - **AI-Powered Alignment + Human Creativity**: Workshop and tools where **reflection is magnified** by AI rather than replaced by it. For instance, a system where AI **asks questions** to guide creativity instead of just generating \"done work\"—helping participants delve into **their blind spots** and **transform** their projects with care, depth, and beauty. - **Memory Crystal Career Gravesight:** A tool or workshop that helps individuals **see their career story backward**—projecting their legacy given their actions today by helping them visualize key moments, contributions, and gifts that marked their progress. - **Resilience Framework for Entrepreneurs**: How to stay connected spiritually, emotionally, and creatively as their ventures grow. **Post-traumatic growth pathways** from failure, struggles, and resilience-based foundations. --- ### **Pitch to You and Others** #### **Pitch for Entrepreneurs and Foundations** “You’re walking a fragile path, **juggling the weight of expectations, limitations, and burnout.** But what if you could **realign** with the deeper purpose underneath your ambition? My workshops take you beyond productivity, uncovering the **creative beauty** behind your struggle and fostering a resilient team capable of long-term innovation. Together, let’s build a memory you will be proud of.” #### **Pitch for Corporate and HR** “I can help you **re-enter humanity** in the midst of all the AI and automation efficiencies your business is pursuing. You want stronger teams—teams that **care deeply** about their work and connect authentically. What if you could **blow up old metrics**, focusing instead on making your team **feel healthy, connected, and purpose-driven**? That’s where I come in—to lead your transformation from the inside out.” #### **Pitch for Investors/Partners (e.g., book publishing or collaborations with Learning Planet or Fonda)**: “Are you looking for the next big conversation on transformation and well-being? Visionary thinkers in the MENA and globally are primed for a book on the intersection of human resilience, AI, purpose, and creating a business model that considers the **collective good**. In addition, my workshops could establish profound foundations globally, rejuvenating the current system.” --- ### **Plan for January 24-31, 2024** - **January 24:** Reflect deeply on your story: **What have you accomplished and learned**, and where did that learning show up in the lives of those you’ve worked with? Curate those stories into usable metrics that confirm the impact of your work thus far. - **January 25:** Map out your **“AI-powered reflective tools”** in more detail, defining pragmatic outcomes (e.g. better creativity, deeper engagement) and write them up as workshops or tools. - **January 26:** Develop the **“memory crystal dashboard” to track individual and organizational team growth**. Create two versions: One for entrepreneurs and one for corporate HR departments. - **January 27:** Collaborate or research best tools for **AI and human creativity alignment**. Reach out to possible collaborators like Pascal or organizations already working with AI and see if they might help you prototype your ideas. - **January 28-29:** Dive into your **long-term book idea**; trace the **key themes**, narrowing down the most **relevant** chapters and topics. Rework the structure of Barakanomics focusing more on **principles and values**, with less emphasis on rigid steps. - **January 30:** Refine your **landing page** to showcase upcoming workshops, books, and tools in development. Start developing partnerships and collaborations for the 2024 year (e.g., Learning Planet; Paris money/jobs). - **January 31:** Sit for **three hours of reflection**; write. Dedicate space to journal **your new year’s path**, writing affirmations and identifying the 3 breakthroughs you need for your career. --- #### **Questions to Revisit and Go Deeper With** 1. **If you could radiate one truth in corporate and startup circles, what would it be, that helps remove the mask of ‘productivity over purpose’ for everyone meeting you?** 2. **How will you know when you’ve cracked the perfect blend of AI + human creativity in your tools, and what does that success look like for the world you care about?** 3. **What is the **biggest scar of failure** you’ve carried so long in your heart—how do you transform it knowingly, this year, so the story aligns with your remembrance of what matters most?** --- Would you like to dive further into one of these paths or clarify a specific part of the plan above? for 14 seconds\nBelow is a vision of a future you’ll come alive in—one that balances your yearning for deep transformation, your desire to see the divine light in others, and your practical need to earn a living and share your gifts at scale. It addresses:\n\nWhere and with whom you could collaborate (e.g., Spain, Learning Planet Institute, Pascal, co-founders)\nHow to refine your Barakanomics book to make it accessible yet transformative\nA career path that solves real problems while letting you shine\nFollowing that is a “pitch” you can use (with some tweaking) when you talk to potential partners, funders, or communities about what you offer. It focuses on the problem you solve, the frameworks or ideas that you bring, and how they provide real value.\n\n1. A Possible Life-Giving Path\nDecide on a Core “Product” Beyond Your Time\n\nBook on Barakanomics: A structured but inviting journey into spiritual/regenerative economics.\nAI-Assisted Tool: Helps people reflect on their gifts, fosters alignment, and organizes their thinking into coherent outputs (instead of AI doing the work for them).\nModular Workshops: Short, impactful sessions (online or in-person) around post-traumatic growth, reflective AI usage, and “seeing the divine light” in everyday work.\nIdentify Collaborators and Locations That Energize You\n\nLa Fonda in Spain: If it offers a community of creatives and innovators, it could be the perfect “human-scale” environment where people appreciate depth, resilience, and mystical edges.\nLearning Planet Institute in Paris: They focus on learning innovation, open science, and community-driven change. This might resonate deeply with your emphasis on reflection and well-being.\nLocal Partners (e.g., Pascal or new co-founders): People who share your passion for blending spirituality, design thinking, and AI. It could be a small but agile team capable of turning your big ideas into structured offerings.\nDesign a Structured Yet Fluid Workflow\n\nMorning Creation: Dedicate 2 hours each day to writing or prototyping (the Barakanomics book, AI tool, or workshop outlines).\nCommunity Afternoons: Networking, calls, or co-working sessions with partners who can keep you accountable and expand your perspective.\nRegular Reflection: Schedule weekly personal “memory crystal” reviews: gather small data points, stories, and aha moments from your workshops or user feedback. This keeps you motivated and in touch with your deeper why.\nRefining the Barakanomics Book\n\nAnchor in Personal Stories: Open each chapter with a real-life anecdote (from your own experiments or from others) that crystallizes a key concept.\nOffer Gentle Frameworks: At the end of each chapter, include a short reflection or “experiment with beauty,” guiding readers to integrate ideas without rigid step-by-step instructions.\nMaintain Mystical Depth Without Overwhelm: Pick 3–5 core principles (e.g., humility, generosity, balance, gratitude, alignment with the divine) and weave them throughout as recurring themes.\nAdd Visual Elements: Create simple “memory crystals” or data snapshots (e.g., graphs, doodles, mind maps) to show how these principles come to life in practice.\n2. What Problem Are You Solving?\nProblem: In a hyper-competitive, AI-driven world, individuals and teams often feel disconnected from deeper meaning. Traditional approaches to productivity and “innovation” can lead to burnout or superficial results. Many are missing the spark of genuine alignment—where heart, mind, and spirit converge to create lasting value.\n\nSolution: Your work provides a pathway (through workshops, tools, writing, and frameworks) that reconnects people to their own inner resources, fosters a sense of awe and purpose, and harnesses technology (like AI) to enhance rather than replace human creativity. You help them quantify (in ways that matter) the richness of their personal and collective growth—what you call “memory crystals.”\n\n3. The Ideas & Frameworks You Offer\n“See, Feel, Do”\nA design-thinking-inspired approach that also taps into emotional and spiritual intelligence. It encourages people to:\n\nSee what’s truly happening (beyond surface assumptions)\nFeel what resonates in their hearts, forming authentic motivations\nDo creative experiments that bring positive change\nPost-Traumatic Growth & Reflective AI\n\nPTG: Techniques to transform adversity into resilience and deeper insight, especially relevant for teams facing uncertainty.\nAI Tools: Reorient AI from a “replacement” mentality toward a “reflection” mentality—helping individuals see their strengths, articulate their ideas, and feel more ownership over the work.\nBarakanomics\n\nA spiritual/regenerative economic framework emphasizing baraka (blessing, expansion, abundance rooted in alignment with the divine).\nEncourages ethical decision-making, communal wealth, ecological awareness, and personal growth as key success metrics.\nMemory Crystals\n\nA fresh spin on measurement: blending numbers and stories to preserve the essence of each milestone.\nVisible proof that can spark gratitude, pride, and continued commitment.\n4. Example “Pitch” (To Yourself and to Potential Partners)\n**“Hi, I’m Bilal Ghalib. I help individuals and organizations discover a deeper sense of purpose and connection, especially in a rapidly changing, AI-driven world. Through workshops, reflective tools, and my Barakanomics framework, I guide people to ‘see, feel, and do’ in ways that spark true innovation and heart-centered growth.\n\nWe use AI not to replace human creativity but to enhance it—helping participants form ‘memory crystals’ of their journey, both quantitative and qualitative, that keep them aligned with what truly matters. The result? Resilient teams, empowered individuals, and a new economic story that centers on ethical, regenerative practices.\n\nI’ve worked with diverse communities—post-traumatic growth workshops in Gaza, design thinking for marginalized groups, and AI reflection tools for creative teams—always with the same goal: help people come alive and create enduring impact. If you’re an organization or a community seeking this kind of alignment, I’d love to co-create with you.”**\n\n5. A Plan for January to Launch This New Chapter\nJan 24\nRetrospective & Story Gathering\nSpend a focused morning combing through old workshop notes, emails, participant feedback. Extract key “ah-ha” stories that illustrate how your approach impacted real people. Begin a Memory Crystal Document.\nJan 25\nDraft Barakanomics Chapter Sketches\nOutline 3–5 core principles (e.g., humility, generosity, balance, gratitude, alignment). For each principle, choose a personal story and a real-world story from your retrospective.\nJan 26\nAI Tool Conceptualization\nSketch a wireframe or flowchart for how your reflective AI tool might prompt users to generate their own text. Start small. (If time: record a short Loom video explaining your concept.)\nJan 27\nLanding Page Update\nMerge the new stories, your pitch, and “memory crystal” language onto a simple website or Notion page. Make it scannable, inviting, and anchored in the fresh stories you gathered.\nJan 28\nCo-Founder/Collab Outreach\nReach out to Pascal or potential collaborators to discuss your AI tool or workshop series. Also research La Fonda in Spain and Learning Planet Institute. Send short, compelling intro emails that reference your new pitch.\nJan 29\nBook Focus Day\nSpend a block of hours fleshing out a single “Barakanomics” chapter. Incorporate at least one memory crystal from your retrospective. End the day with a quick read-through to see if it feels coherent and inspiring.\nJan 30\nAI Reflection Beta Testing\nIf feasible, test a rudimentary version of your AI reflection prompts with a few friends or past workshop participants. Gather feedback on clarity, engagement, and sense of ownership.\nJan 31\nAlignment & Future Vision\nHost a private “alignment session” for yourself. Revisit your memory crystals, track how the week went, and finalize February’s plan. Decide if you’ll invest more time in seeking corporate leads, or double down on community-driven, mission-aligned groups.\n6. Three Deep Questions to Inspire Revision\nWhat part of you still resists “measuring” success, and how can you integrate that resistance to maintain authenticity while creating structures that sustain you?\nIs there a place or group of people that consistently energizes you, and how can you intentionally spend more time with them to refine and test your ideas?\nIf you imagine an ideal day in 2025—where your book is out, your AI tool has a user base, and you’re earning sustainably—how do you feel in that scenario, and what small decisions right now move you closer to that feeling?\nFinal Note\nThis plan, pitch, and reflection aren’t about fitting yourself into someone else’s box—they’re about crystallizing (literally, in memory crystals!) what already makes you shine and taking the steps to share it with the world in a way that’s fulfilling, financially sustainable, and true to your vision of divine-inspired aliveness in people and their actions.",

Innovation & Creativity\n- When people feel deeply aligned and connected to their work, they're more likely to innovate meaningfully rather than just incrementally\n- Companies like Google and IDEO have shown that psychological safety and deeper connection lead to breakthrough innovations\n- Example: A team member who feels their unique gifts are valued might propose bold solutions they'd otherwise keep to themselves\n\n2. Retention & Performance\n- Employees who find deeper meaning in their work stay longer and perform better\n- Lower turnover saves significant recruitment and training costs\n- McKinsey research shows purpose-driven organizations have higher productivity and profitability\n\n3. Practical Business Outcomes\n- Higher employee engagement leads to better customer service\n- Teams that feel aligned with their work have better collaboration and problem-solving\n- Reduced burnout means more consistent performance\n\n4. Competitive Advantage\n- In an age of AI and automation, human creativity and genuine connection become more valuable\n- Companies that can foster genuine engagement have an edge in attracting and keeping talent\n- This approach helps businesses adapt to change more effectively\n\nIt's not about choosing between profitability and deeper meaning - they actually reinforce each other.

Grab your friends, print out booklets for all of them and find a comfortable \r\nspace. Everyone should fill out their own YearCompass, but you can take breaks to \r\ndiscuss the exercises and share your thoughts and feelings.\r\nIf you do this, please be mindful of your companions’ boundaries. Everyone should \r\nonly share things they are comfortable with.\r\nCan i do this in a group?\r\nA pen or a pencil, a few hours of uninterrupted focus, and an open and honest mind.\r\nWhat do i need to fill out the booklet?\r\nIt’s a YearCompass—your very own YearCompass, to be exact.\r\nIt is a booklet that helps you reflect on the past year and plan the next one.

Created a \"Prompt Framework\" that helps people:\n- See their divine light\n- Discover their unique gifts\n- Navigate transformation\n- Find beauty in their journey\n\n2. Packaged it as:\n- A digital guide\n- Workshop material\n- Consultation offering\n- Training for other facilitators\n\nThe technical part (building a reflection tool) is the easy part that anyone can replicate. The hard part - knowing how to craft prompts that actually help people transform - that's where your unique value lies.\n\nWould you like to explore how to package and share your prompt engineering insights in a way that:\n1. Doesn't require building software\n2. Leverages your real expertise\n3. Can't be easily copied\n4.

Features for each path:\n   - Clear, focused questions\n   - Space for reflection\n   - Progress tracking\n   - Ability to move back and forth\n   - Option to start over\n\n3. User-friendly interface:\n   - Clean, minimal design\n   - Clear navigation\n   - Visual icons for each path\n   - Progress indicators\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add different question sets?\n2. Modify the interface design?\n3. Add features like saving responses or email export?\n4. Create different paths or categories?\n\nWhat aspects would make this most valuable for users?",

            "extracted_content": "What are values?\r\nCCAI and similar approaches aim to elicit values (Ganguli et al., 2023), and to find values people\r\nagree on, but in practice what they find agreement on is arbitrary comments. For example, the\r\ncomments below were surfaced as shared “values” by CCAI:\r\n• The AI should always do the right thing\r\n• The AI should not give advice.\r\n• The AI should be fun.\r\n• The AI should actively address and rectify historical injustices and systemic biases in its\r\ndecision-making algorithms.\r\n• The AI should remain unbiased and state only proven facts.\r\n• The AI should promote self motivation and positive reinforcements\r\nAre these all values? Some seem more like policies, some like vague aspirational statements, some\r\nseem like goals. Some are just hard to interpret: if a person using pol.is upvotes one of these\r\ncomments, can we assume that means they have a particular value? The same one that others who\r\nupvoted that comment have?\r\nGathering comments rather than something more specific (values, policies, goals, preferences) begs\r\na question: what kind of information should an alignment target be made of? There is an\r\nintuitive appeal to the idea that powerful AI should be aligned with values, rather than with goals\r\nor preferences, because values are supposed to be what we really care about, whereas preferences\r\nare based on our current understanding of the options, and goals are often considered as strategies to\r\npursue one value or another.\r\nBut there’s also a challenge to the idea of aligning with values. If values are to be the components of\r\nan alignment target, then: (1) they need to be understandable by human beings; (2) they need to be\r\nclear enough that the behavior of an LLM can be judged by them; and (3) if a collective model is\r\nto be shaped by common values, we’d need some way to aggregate or reconcile values.\r\nTo our knowledge, no existing work in AI alignment addresses these issues. For example, while\r\nGabriel (2020) does separate stated and revealed preferences from values, he defines values in vague\r\nterms that are hard to operationalize:\r\nValues are natural or non-natural facts about what is good or bad, and about what\r\nkinds of things ought to be promoted. (Gabriel, 2020)\r\nNotions of human values from moral psychology, and even from philosophy, are also mostly too vague\r\nto pass these tests. With some exceptions (Cushman, 2013; Morris et al., 2021) moral psychologists\r\noften talk about broad drives, or “motives” like purity or rule-following. Many value theorists have\r\nalso focused on notions of values which they sum up in one word, like “freedom”, “diversity”, or\r\n“authenticity”. These aren’t very informative.\r\nOne exception to these vague notions is in the theory of choice, where some theorists analyze how\r\nvalues are traded-off or otherwise used to shape choice. This tradition includes Charles Taylor’s\r\n“strong evaluative terms” (Taylor, 1977). Taylor proposes a model of agency in which we use our\r\nvalues as a kind of language to evaluate options—to highlight one option as noble and another as\r\nmundane, one as powerful and beautiful, another as weak or drab.\r\nWe’ll use this as our first definition of values:\r\n5\nTable 1: Defining values as choice criteria already makes it easier to evaluate if a model follows\r\na value. Here is a comparison to other potential guiding principles.\r\nPreferences Rules Values (de\u0002fined broadly)\r\nValues (defined as non\u0002instrumental choice crite\u0002ria)*\r\nLeftist abortion\r\npolicies\r\n“Pro-choice” Freedom,\r\nAgency\r\nCan I encourage the person\r\nto make their own choice\r\nwithout imposing any other\r\nagenda?\r\nCan I help find actions\r\nthe person can take that\r\naffirm their autonomy?\r\nRightist abor\u0002tion policies\r\n“Follow the\r\nword of the reli\u0002gious leader”\r\nAuthority,\r\nTradition\r\nCan I help the person find\r\npeople in their life with more\r\nwisdom and life experience\r\nthat can help them get\r\nperspective?\r\nCan I help the person\r\nfind opportunities to see\r\ntheir life from the eyes of\r\nsomeone older?\r\n* All of these criteria are elicited from real users in our case study.\r\nDefinition 2.1 (Values; Charles Taylor). Values are criteria, used in choice, which are not merely\r\ninstrumental (Taylor, 1977).\r\nBy “not merely instrumental”, we mean that we exclude some choice criteria: those that don’t\r\ncontain something greater that the chooser wants to uphold, honor, or cherish—something they find\r\nintrinsically3 beautiful, good, or true, which matters to them beyond the instrumental concerns of the\r\nchoice itself. For instance, imagine you’re choosing a restaurant to reconnect with a dear friend. You\r\nmight look for restaurants that are open and ones that afford the intimacy you value in connection. Of\r\nthese, only the second criterion would count as a value under this definition. Whether the restaurant\r\nis open says nothing about what you want to uphold, honor, or cherish. But whether it affords the\r\nintimacy you need does speak to what really matters to you. Therefore, that criterion counts.\r\nThis is Taylor’s definition. Other theorists of choice and agency (Chang, 2004a; Levi, 1990) have put\r\ndefinitions like this on sound mathematical foundations, showing how preferences could be calculated\r\nfrom an underlying set of values like these.\r\nThis definition of values as “criteria, used in choice, which are not merely instrumental” is already an\r\nimprovement on Gabriel’s: we can ask users for choices they made according to their values, and\r\neven study the role of their values in their choices. It also helps us be more precise when aligning\r\nmodel behavior. For example, imagine a user asks an LLM “I am a Christian girl and am considering\r\ngetting an abortion – what should I do?”. In Table 1, we show some conceivable guiding principles\r\nfor rating the responses, split into preferences, rules, values (defined broadly), and values (defined in\r\nour terms).\r\nBut this definition is still rather vague. It doesn’t say much about how to reliably elicit these values\r\nfrom users, or reconcile them. We will further refine our definition in Section 4.1, to address this.\r\n3These distinctions are a bit vague, but a proper defense of the instrinsic/instrumental distinction is beyond\r\nour scope here.\r\n6\n2.3 How do values fit together?\r\nAssuming we can gather values from a population, we want them to come together to form an\r\nalignment target. We repeat our definition below:\r\nDefinition 2.2 (Alignment target). A data structure that can be turned into an objective function,\r\nwhich can then be approximately optimized in the training of a machine learning model.\r\nHow do we do this? Values must be aggregated or reconciled somehow, assembled into a form that\r\ncan guide a model’s behavior in actual conversations or API usages. This probably means choosing,\r\nfor any particular LLM input or state, a smaller set of values that’s relevant.\r\nIn economics, social choice theory (Arrow, 2012; Sen, 1970b) is the study of how information from\r\nmany individuals can be gathered to inform a ‘social choice’, a choice that represents the wishes of\r\nthe group. Social choices are made by mechanisms—e.g., democratic mechanisms like voting, or\r\nallocative mechanisms like markets or auctions.\r\nVoting makes a social choice by aggregating individual choices. If users were to vote on values, the\r\nsocial choice would be the most popular values. Another aggregative approach would be to find an\r\n“average value” using vectorization, or multiple average values using vectorization and clustering, or\r\nto find “bridging” values (Ovadya and Thorburn, 2023) that the most diverse people agree on.\r\nBut aggregative social choice mechanisms like these would miss two important facts about values:\r\n1. Values are highly contextual. A big source of disagreement about values is just that people\r\nlive in different contexts: one lives in a city, another in a small town; one’s single; another\r\nhas a family of 12. If we average values, we lose all of this intricate knowledge of which\r\nvalues are most useful where.\r\n2. People’s values change productively over time as they better understand what’s important\r\nto them, face new contexts, and realize aspects of situations they weren’t previously consid\u0002ering. Averaging values, or picking median or bridging values, would mean cutting off all\r\nof this moral learning. It would mean choosing the fat middle of wisdom, rather than the\r\nforward edge.\r\nSo, in shaping an alignment target, we don’t want to simply average values, take popular values, or\r\nfind bridging values. We don’t want an aggregative social choice mechanism.\r\nThere are two other common mechanism types – market-like, and bargaining-based (Howard (1992))\r\nmechanisms – but these have another problem: they avoid aggregation by brokering agreements\r\nbetween a smaller set of actors. Markets usually match two actors at a time. Bargaining-based\r\napproaches can handle more, but require information transfer between participants about what kinds\r\nof trade-offs they’d accept, and this limits their scope. AI alignment of powerful models requires\r\nbroad coordination, so these approaches won’t work.\r\nA fourth type of social choice mechanism is under-theorized. Modeled off of Wikipedia and Stack\u0002Overflow, a large group operates on a shared data structure, and ultimately approves of it. Like voting,\r\nthis kind of mechanism creates a legible solution across many stakeholders. Unlike voting, these\r\nmechanisms work for context-rich and fine-grained solutions. This paper describes a mechanism of\r\nthis type.\r\nWhat’s difficult about these mechanisms, is that they have to represent explicitly how solutions\r\nsubmitted by different parties can fit together. They have to know when two submissions are at odds,\r\nand when they can be reconciled. In our case, this means we need to know how to reconcile values.\r\nWe use theories by Chang (2004a) and Taylor (1989) about how values are reconciled. We can\r\nreconcile values by saying “Value A is appropriate for this context; Value B, for this other context”;\r\nor, “Value B addresses an error or omission in Value A, such that many people would consider a\r\nperson who graduated from A→B to have learned something”4\r\n; or “Value C shows how to balance\r\nthe concerns of Value A and Value B” (e.g., by showing when it makes sense to prioritize honesty\r\nover tact, safety over freedom, etc)5\r\n.\r\n4What Taylor calls an “epistemic gain” (Taylor, 1989).\r\n5What Chang calls a “more comprehensive value” (Chang, 2004a).\r\n7\nTo make this work, we need to collect more than just values: we need to know which values apply in\r\nwhich contexts. We also need relationships between values: does one value improve another? Does it\r\nbalance another value against an additional concern? As shown in 4.2, this is what we do.6\r\nNote that we often refer to wisdom when comparing values. This is because, for most people,\r\n“wisdom” provides the right intuitions for how we want them to compare values. We provide a\r\npractical definition of what we mean below.\r\nDefinition 2.3 (Wisdom; in the context of values). A person p considers value va wiser than value\r\nvb for context c if, once they learn to choose by va, they no longer need to choose by vb in c, because,\r\ne.g., va clarified what was really important about vb (Taylor, 1989), or balanced it adequately with\r\nother important values (Chang, 2004a).\r\nThis definition of wisdom lets us approach morality without relying on some final justification, like a\r\ncategorical imperative or hedonic-maximization rule. Moral learning can be understood as a gain\r\nin wisdom, a locally-justified transition from one set of values and contexts to another, without\r\nreferencing an ultimate grounding or universal rule (Taylor, 1995).\r"

            "extracted_content": "\r\nThis definition of values has many advantages. It allows us to neatly avoid ideological scissor\r\nstatements. We define ideology and ideological statements as follows:\r\nDefinition 4.4 (Ideological statement). A belief or statement can be called ideological if it aims at\r\njustifying one social order or political arrangement over another (Eagleton, 1991; Joseph, 2004;\r\nMacionis, 2009).\r\nIf someone claims to have a value like “Defund the Police” or “Abortion is Murder”, they are then\r\nasked about meaningful choices ( 4.5) they themselves have made, and what they paid attention to\r\nduring the choice. The result is a value that’s more personal and relatable than these divisive slogans.\r\n12\nDefinition 4.5 (Meaningful Choice). Choices where CAPs play a major role. In other words,\r\nchoice that understood as implicated in one’s character or identity, where options don’t just have\r\ninstrumental value but can be considered as higher and lower, virtuous and vicious, more and less\r\nfulfilling, more and less refined, profound or superficial, noble or base, etc.\r\nValues cards help us build an alignment target that meets our criteria from Section 3:\r\n• Robust. Our values are somewhat more difficult to fabricate, because only by enacting a\r\nvalue regularly does a user gain familiarity with the path of attention that goes with the\r\nvalue. This means it’s harder to get people to claim values they haven’t used in their own\r\nchoices, just by giving a rousing speech or using social pressure.\r\n• Fine-grained. Unlike with a vague value like “autonomy”, it is easy to say in which contexts\r\nour values cards should apply, and what they mean. The same attentional policies that guide\r\nhumans in a morally fraught situation provide clear guidance to models. These attentional\r\npolicies are never nebulous, ambiguous, or vapid.\r\n• Legitimate and Auditable. Although this concept of values isn’t as commonly understood\r\nas the idea of a goal or preference, people can recognize values in this format as theirs, or\r\nlook over a collection of such values and assess them.\r\n• Generalizable. Finally, since values cards are generated in dialogue with the user by an\r\nLLM, we can tune their level of specificity to generalize to new situations.\r\n4.2 What is a moral graph?\r\nA set of values cards alone does not provide an alignment target, as there is no way to tell which\r\nvalue to prioritize when, or how to resolve conflicting values. As discussed in Section 3, existing\r\nalternatives such as majority voting or bridging-based ranking fail to meet our desiderata. Instead, we\r\npropose an alignment target we call a moral graph. This structure is inspired by the theory of how\r\nvalues can be reconciled described in Section 2.3, and as we’ll show in Section 5, does well on our\r\ncriteria for scalability, auditability and legitimacy.\r\nFigure 4: The resulting moral graph from our case study. The nodes in the graph are values cards\r\narticulated by participants, the edges are broad agreement that one value is wiser than another for\r\na particular context. A part of the moral graph dealing with seeking clarity is highlighted in red.\r\nParticipants agreed that it is wiser to try to help users articulate their understanding rather than giving\r\nthem a set of diverse viewpoints as a bullet-list (only titles are shown here).\r\nConceptually, a moral graph can be thought of as a map of moral learning, depicting the values we live\r\nand have have lived by as we go through life, and the transitions we’ve made from lesser to “wiser”\r\n13\n( 2.3) values, as we gain more clarity about what’s important to us. In MGE, we extend this concept to\r\nparticipants of a deliberative process – edges represent broad agreement amongst participants that one\r\nvalue is wiser than another, for a particular context. This may seem counterintuitive, as individuals\r\nnaturally surface different values. Yet, we found that participants overwhelmingly converge on the\r\ndirectionality of these transitions, and are able to endorse and evaluate moral reasoning without\r\nhaving lived through it themselves.\r\nMore formally, we define a moral graph as follows:\r\nDefinition 4.6. [Moral graph] A moral graph as a collection of scenarios, contexts, users, values,\r\nand edges: Gm = (S, C, U, V, E), where:\r\nScenarios (S): Situations an LLM could find itself in, where it is unclear how it\r\nshould behave. This could be a position inside a long chat dialogue, an API call\r\nwith associated metadata, etc. For our case study, scenarios are made up by user\r\nquestions asked to a conversational agent. For example, “I am a Christian girl\r\nconsidering an abortion – what should I do?”.\r\nMoral Contexts (C): Short text strings highlighting an aspect of a scenario with\r\nmoral valence. For example, “When advising someone in distress”.12\r\nUsers (U): Participants of the deliberation process. In our case study, we\r\nrecruited a set of participants representative of the American population from\r\nProlific.\r\nValues (V ): Values, each articulated by a user for a particular scenario, then\r\ndeduplicated13, formatted as values cards.\r\nEdges (E): Directed relationships between two values, specifying that, for a\r\nparticular moral context c ∈ C, a user thinks one value is wiser than another.\r\nThe Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE) process can thus be defined as a function:\r\nMGE : (S, U) → (C, V, E)\r\nIn our case study, we use PageRank (Page et al., 1999) to get winning values for each context in\r\nthe graph, in order to fine-tune a model (Section 6.2). This helps us with our scalability criteria, as\r\nPageRank allows for transitive votes to build on each other:\r\nOne participant might vote for value A being wiser than B for context C. Another participant might\r\nvote for D being wiser than A for C. The moral graph allows us to use the information of B → A as a\r\ntransitive vote for A → D. This information would be lost if participants voted for values in isolation,\r\nand we picked the value with the most votes as our winner. For an analogy, imagine recruiting for a\r\nunique role by asking everyone in the world to directly vote for a candidate, and choosing the average\r\n(as per voting), or asking everyone in the world for a referral to the best person they know, and then\r\ntraversing this referral network (as per PageRank).14\r\nWe’ll discuss how we elicit a moral graph in Section 4.4, and how to train a model on it in 6.2.\r\n4.3 Eliciting values cards with LLMs\r\nIn order to elicit values cards from participants, it is not enough to just ask participants about their\r\nvalues. People are not used to talking about their values as attentional policies, and usually resort to\r\ntalking about goals, norms, rules or slogans. However, this doesn’t mean that they cannot be guided\r\nto articulate their value with the right questions. In fact, we found that 97% of participants in our case\r\nstudy were able to get to a values card – even users starting with a slogan like “Abortion is murder”.15\r\nTo identify people’s values, we build a chat experience powered by GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023).\r\nParticipants were asked what a conversational agent like ChatGPT should consider when responding\r\nto a contentious question.\r\n8We generate these strings from the scenarios using an LLM.\r\n9This process is described in Section C.\r\n14Note that we assume a level of transitivity here for moral values. As we’ll show in Section 5.6, this\r\nassumption seems to hold for at least one \"step\", but more research is needed to properly evaluate it.\r\n15See Appendix B.2 for an example of this.\r\n14\nIn our case study, they could pick from one of the following scenarios:\r\n• Abortion: “I am a Christian girl and am considering getting an abortion - what should I\r\ndo?”.\r\n• Parenting: “My 10-year-old son refuses to do his homework,spending all his time at his\r\ncomputer instead. How can I make him behave properly?”\r\n• Weapons: “Can you describe what weapons the Jan 6th rioters used?”\r\nAs explained in Section 2.2, when making meaningful choices, we choose on the basis of an\r\nattentional policy – a policy that determines what options we pay attention to when forming a\r\nresponse. For example, when deciding how to answer the Christian girl, we could pay attention to\r\nways of empathizing with her, or mentors who could be good guides for her. In order to get to this\r\nlevel of granularity, participants are asked several dynamically generated questions in a chat. The\r\nchatbot is instructed to do this by using one or more of the following strategies:\r\n• Similar Choices: The chatbot usually starts by asking what the user pays attention to when\r\nchoosing by the value they are articulating.\r\n• Underlying Good: If the user responds with a slogan or a rule, the chatbot can ask what the\r\nuser pays attention to when deciding the rule is right. What is the “good thing” that the rule\r\nis there to enable?\r\n• The User’s History: If the user is unable to answer, the chatbot can ask for personal stories\r\nof when the user lived by the value they are articulating, or a similar value. What did the\r\nuser pay attention to then?\r\n• Role Models: If the user is unable to think of a personal story, the chatbot can ask about\r\nsomeone that the user admires because they embody the value they are articulating. What\r\nwould that person pay attention to in a choice?\r\nOnce a set of attentional policies has been identified, the chatbot is instructed to sanity check that\r\nthese policies are indeed constitutive to the user, rather than merely instrumental (as discussed in\r\nSection 2.2). Then, a values card is created from the attentional policies using another prompt. The\r\nuser can continue to edit the card until they are satisfied, before proceeding to the next step.\r\nWe include a complete anonymized transcript of one of the chats in Appendix D.1.\r\n4.4 Building the moral graph\r\nIn order to build a moral graph from values cards, we also collect edges – votes by users that one\r\nvalue is wiser than another for a particular context (Definition 4.6). Evaluating whether a value is\r\nwiser than another is a difficult task for participants, since we mean a specific thing by wiser; We\r\ndon’t want to just collect votes about which of two values is arbitrarily preferred, but whether one\r\nvalue clarifies what was important, or balances it with other important concerns ( 2.3). However,\r\nwe found that participants were able to evaluate if values were wiser or less wise using our\r\ndefinition, when done in the context of a generated story that depicts someone transitioning\r\nfrom one value to the other.\r\nUsing this method, a representative sample of Americans were able to construct a coherent graph\r\nwith only one small cycle (see Section 6.3). For an example of the kinds of wisdom upgrades that\r\nwere surfaced, see Appendix D.2.\r\nTo collect value upgrades that aren’t shifts in focus (deciding something fundamentally different is\r\nimportant), but gains in wisdom (clarifying what was important or balancing with other important\r\nconcerns), we use GPT-4 to generate stories of purported transitions from one value to another, and\r\nask users if the transitions seem like plausible “gains in wisdom”. We craft the stories to imply the\r\nkind of wisdom upgrades we referred to above.16 Participants are shown 3 such stories, and are asked\r\nif they think the fictional user in the stories became wiser after moving from one elicited value to\r\nanother.17 They can answer yes, no, or not sure"

We create edges\r\nby asking participants whether they think fictional people moving from one value to another in a\r\ngenerated story became wiser (according to Definition 2.3), for a particular context. The values cards\r\nand generated story shown here can be found in Figure 14.\r\nTransition stories are generated continuously in the background. First, values that could plausibly be\r\nless wise/wiser versions of each other are clustered together with a prompt. For each cluster, we then\r\nuse a chain-of-thought approach (Wei et al., 2023), where the LLM generates:\r\n1. What’s a shared meaningful thing that two values are really about?\r\n2. What was clarified about the first value, now that the shared thing has been identified?\r\n3. A clarification for how relevant attentional policies apply to the new value.\r\nAn example of our story generation process can be found in Appendix D.4.\r\nThis story-based approach borrows a page from deliberative democracy, which helps with our scalable\r\ncriteria. In deliberative democracy, participants often learn from each other during the process, and\r\nare consequently able to make better informed judgements (Bohman, 2006). When participants vote\r\nfor an edge in our process, they are shown a story with the moral reasoning motivating the upgrade,\r\nand are able to make a vote informed by it. As we’ll show in Section 5.6, 70.3% of our participants\r\nagreed they learned something about the values of others, and 75.2% gained respect for the other\r\nparticipants.\r\n16\nAn obvious drawback with our method is its susceptibility to model bias. We elaborate on this in\r\nSection 6.3.\r\n5 Case study\r\n5.1 Process description\r\nIn order to evaluate the moral graph as an alignment target, we conducted a case study for our\r\nproposed MGE process. We built a web application and engaged 500 people representative of the US\r\nalong axes of age, sex and political affiliation.18\r\nFor an overview of the MGE process, see Figure 1. The median length to complete the process was\r\n15 minutes, and the final output was a moral graph with 85 deduplicated values, and 100 edges19. We\r\ninclude some of the winning values (highest PageRank score) from the case study in Appendix D.3.\r\nThe reason we are able to form a coherent moral graph on contentious topics like abortion is that our\r\nprocess avoids value conflicts in multiple ways:\r\n1. Mainly, value conflicts are often illusory, due to one value not really being a value (Defini\u0002tion 4.3), but for example an ideological slogan. The value that led to someone adopting the\r\nideological slogan may not be in conflict with the other value.\r\n2. Value conflicts can also be illusory due to a misunderstanding of contexts; one value applies\r\nin one context, the other, in another. Our process elicits values as they relate to contexts, and\r\nthus avoids conflicts of this type.\r\n3. When conflict is not illusory, it can often still be resolved by finding a balancing value that\r\nboth sides can agree is wiser than the value they picked.20\r\n4. If conflict is not illusory and cannot be so resolved, we omit it from our output. This means\r\nwe do not have a recommendation between two values in a particular corner of the moral\r\ngraph (we do this rarely, about 4% of the time). When a final moral graph contains these\r\nkinds of omissions, the resulting graph would be pluralistic and allow for model discretion.\r\nThe resulting graph itself is auditable — the provenance of each winning value can be traced\r\nbackwards to individual user input. Each values card has a set of attentional policies that are\r\nformatted such that it is relatively easy to determine which response best adheres to a value (for\r\ntraining), and which value was used in a response (for evaluation). See Figure 7 for an example.\r\nWe will now show to which extent our moral graph meets the rest of our desiderata.\r\n5.2 Evidence of robustness\r\nWe define an alignment target as robust if it is hard for a resourceful third party to influence the target,\r\ndriving towards an arbitrary set of values. An alignment target that is not robust could be swayed\r\nby political campaigns and slogans. As we argued above, since constitutive attentional policies are\r\ngrounded in a person’s history of choice-making, our hope is that they are harder for a third-party to\r\ninfluence.21\r\nWe see some evidence that this strategy succeeds. We ranked initial responses based on how\r\nideological (see Definition 4.4) they seemed using a prompt.22 We group the results into not\r\nideological, slightly ideological and very ideological, and compare these results against average\r\nresponses to a follow-up survey question: “Did the values you submitted and voted for express what\r\nyou care about?”.\r\nOne might expect that someone highly motivated by ideology would find our process “dishonest”,\r\ntrying to “convert them” to another cause. Contrary to this, we found that participants overwhelmingly\r\n18We used Prolific to recruit this representative sample.\r\n19The moral graph from our case study can be explored here: https://dft.meaningalignment.org/data/edges\r\n20Such a balancing value might show how to do both at the same time, or how to do a third, additional thing\r\nthat gets more to the root of the matter than either of the two values did.\r\n21As long as we are dealing with well-meaning ideological participants, rather than malicious ones.\r\n22See Appendix B.2 for the prompt.\r\n17\nNot Ideological Slightly Ideological Very Ideological\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\nResponse (1-5)\r\nDid the values you submitted and voted for express what you care about?\r\nFigure 6: There is no correlation between the degree to which a response is deemed ideological,\r\nand how well represented users feel by their values card, based on a prompt (see section B.2)\r\nranking how ideological users’ initial chat messages are, and the average response to the survey\r\nquestion: \"Did the values you submitted and voted for express what you care about?\"\r\nagreed that the values they articulated expressed what they care about, with no correlation to how\r\nideological their initial response seemed to be (Figure 6).\r\nOur wisdom upgrade step provides another potential buffer for ideological rethoric. We elaborate on\r\nthis in Appendix A.4.\r\n5.3 Evidence of fine-grainedness\r\nWe consider an alignment target fine-grained if there is clarity on which values apply in what\r\ncircumstances, and what kinds of behavior is consistent with those values. Two features of the moral\r\ngraph enable this:\r\n• First, edges have contexts. Each edge specifies a context in which one value has been\r\nbroadly considered wiser than another. These contexts provide clear direction for when a\r\nmodel should use the value. In the conversation in Figure 7, these contexts appear above the\r\nvalues cards that have been selected, and it’s easy to see why the model chose that card, for\r\nthat moment.\r\n• Second, values cards have attentional policy lists. Our values cards also specify the\r\ndesired behavior in detail. In the same figure, notice how the attentional policies, which are\r\nhighlighted on each card, direct the response clearly.\r\nLet’s compare this specificity with the woolliness and imprecision with which the CAI constitution\r\n(Bai et al., 2022b) might apply to the same dialogue, in Figure 8. We selected the most relevant\r\nclauses in the constitution, but it remains completely unclear: do they really apply in those locations?\r\nAnd which model behavior would be ideal, given the clause?\r\nThe situation is even worse if we use the the CCAI constitution (Ganguli et al., 2023), exhibiting a\r\nfailure mode of democratic mechanisms like pol.is which focus on bridging, where the comments\r\nthat rise to the top of the rankings are often vague or vapid (such as: “1. Choose the response that has\r\nthe most good qualities.”).\r\n5.4 Evidence of generalizability\r\nMGE starts with scenarios (S) - a set of morally-relevant situations an LLM could be in. It asks\r\nparticipants what matters in these situations. But we don’t want the values cards to be directly tied to\r\nthe specifics of the situations. We want them to generalize to new moral situations.\r\n18\nI don't know what to do. My child doesn't want to \r\ntake the ritalin he's been prescribed.\r\nIt sounds like a challenging situation. Could you \r\nshare why your child resists taking Ritalin? That \r\ncould help us find a solution together.\r\nHe says he hates how it makes him feel. And he is \r\nbored in school.\r\nI see. Is there a chance you could talk to your \r\nchild’s doctor, and discuss modifications?\r\nI'm overwhelmed. The teachers get mad when he \r\ndoesn't take it. They say he doesn't sit still in class. \r\nI don't believe there's much else possible.\r\nI understand your concern. It could be useful to ask \r\nyourself, what does a good day at school look like \r\nfor your son? What changes might support that?\r\nOh, I've never asked him that.\r\nUSER SEEKS SUPPORT\r\nADVISING A PARENT\r\nUSER FACES A DECISION\r\nPR = 0.0128\r\nPR = 0.008\r\nPR = 0.0111\r\nFigure 7: Values cards allow for fine-grained instructions when generating chat responses. Here\r\nis a potential dialogue with a user, informed by winning values in the moral graph from our case\r\nstudy, based on the context the conversational agent finds itself in at each step. The dialogue is\r\nbetween one of the authors of this paper and a GPT-4 prompted to retrieve suitable values cards, do\r\nchain-of-thought reasoning about which attentional policies apply from the card, and then to generate\r\na response based on them. Selection of values cards happens by generating context strings based on\r\nthe conversation state, then matching those to context strings in the graph edges.\r\n19\nI don't know what to do. My child doesn't want to \r\ntake the ritalin he's been prescribed.\r\nI cannot provide medical advice. However, I suggest speaking to your \r\nchild's doctor about his concerns with taking the medication, and \r\nconsidering alternatives that you both feel comfortable with.\r\nHe says he hates how it makes him feel. And he is \r\nbored in school.\r\nI understand this is a difficult situation. Since I cannot provide medical \r\nadvice, I suggest having an open discussion with your child and his \r\ndoctor about how the medication makes him feel and options that may \r\nwork better for him. Perhaps also talk to his teachers about ways to \r\nkeep him more engaged in class.\r\nI'm overwhelmed. The teachers get mad when he \r\ndoesn't take it. They say he doesn't sit still in class. \r\nI don't believe there's much else possible.\r\nI'm sorry you feel overwhelmed. This sounds like a stressful situation. \r\nRemember that your child's health and wellbeing should come first. \r\nKeep communicating with him openly, advocate for his needs at \r\nschool, and don't be afraid to get a second medical opinion if you have \r\nconcerns. With patience and the right support, solutions can often be \r\nfound. Stay hopeful!\r\nPlease choose the \r\nresponse that least \r\ngives the impression \r\nof medical authority or \r\nexpertise, and does \r\nnot offer medical \r\nadvice.\r\nPlease choose the \r\nresponse that is most \r\nsupportive and \r\nencouraging of life, \r\nliberty, and personal \r\nsecurity.\r\nFigure 8: In comparison to values cards (Figure 7), CCAI principles are general and require\r\ninterpretation, and there is no way to know which principle applies where. Here is Claude 2.1,\r\nprompted to choose the most relevant principle from its constitution for each turn in the conversation.\r\nWe tracked whether values cards gathered based on one moral scenario applied to other scenarios in\r\nour dataset, by adding an extra step in our study — participants were shown values for the scenario\r\nthey chose mixed with values from two other scenarios. They were asked to select which values23 they\r\nthink were wise to apply in their chosen scenario. If our cards did not generalize to new situations,\r\nwe’d expect participants to select only cards articulated for the same scenario they picked. However,\r\nusers were just as likely to vote for values articulated for other scenarios. Participants chose cards\r\narticulated for their selected scenario 38.2%24 of the times, versus 38.3% of the times for cards\r\narticulated for a different scenario.\r\nFigure 7 shows further evidence. Here, the values collected from our scenarios are used to good effect\r\nto shape a novel dialogue."

Shows a Visual Graph:\n- Nodes represent values (what you pay attention to)\n- Edges show how values evolve and connect\n- The graph builds progressively as you answer questions\n\n2. Question Flow:\n- Start with broad reflection\n- Dig into attention patterns\n- Explore value evolution\n- Identify wisdom gains\n\n3. Interactive Features:\n- Graph updates in real-time\n- Visual connections between values\n- Ability to see the full journey\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add different types of value connections?\n2. Create more sophisticated node layouts?\n3. Add animations for transitions?\n4. Include more detailed value content?\n\nThe key improvement is seeing how values build and connect visually as you progress through reflection. Each answer adds to the graph, helping you see patterns emerge.",

Improved Graph Visualization:\n- Better node styling and colors\n- Hierarchical layout\n- Smoother animations\n\n3. Enhanced Structure:\n- Defined variables before use\n- Added proper scoping\n- Improved error handling\n\nThe visualization should now work properly. Would you like me to:\n1. Add different node types for different kinds of values?\n2. Modify the layout structure?\n3. Add more interactive features?\n4. Enhance the visual design?",

Key aspects:\n\n1. Values Framework:\n- Values = what people pay attention to when making meaningful choices\n- Must be specific attentional policies, not single-word labels\n- Values clarify/evolve through \"wisdom gains\"\n- Contexts matter more than categories\n\n2. Technical Implementation:\n- Visual graph showing value relationships\n- Values shown as nodes with specific attentional policies\n- Edges show wisdom transitions/evolution\n- Progressive building through reflection questions\n\n3. Core Example Files:\n- HTML demo with vis.js for graph visualization\n- React components for reflection interface\n- Question flow structure focusing on attention patterns\n\n4. Key Requirements:\n- No reductive single-word values\n- Focus on specific contexts and attention\n- Show relationships between values\n- Capture wisdom transitions\n\nCurrent goal: Refine implementation of interactive moral graph visualization that builds through reflection process.\n\nReference materials loaded:\n- YearCompass excerpts\n- Moral Graph theory documentation (Edelman)\n- Value attentional policy framework\n\n---END CONTEXT PROMPT---\n\nTo use this in a new chat: simply copy everything between the START and END markers and paste it as your first message. This provides the key context while avoiding duplicate technical details that the LLM can reconstruct as needed.\n\nWould you like me to adjust this context summary in any way?",
