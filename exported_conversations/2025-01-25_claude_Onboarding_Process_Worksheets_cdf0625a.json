Your central insight is that our todo lists reveal both who we are and who we wish to become.\nFundamental Concepts\n1. Todo Lists as Mirrors\nEvery todo list contains two types of actions that reveal our current way of being:\nA. Instrumental Actions (IAPs):\n\nDone to achieve other ends\nValue comes from results\nOften feel like \"have to\" or \"should\"\nExample: \"Call mom at 10pm because I should stay in touch\"\n\nB. Constitutive Actions (CAPs):\n\nExpress meaningful ways of being\nValue inherent in the doing\nCreate sense of aliveness\nExample: \"Share early morning moments with mom when we're both fresh\"\n\n2. Sources of Meaning\nA source of meaning is a specific way of living that brings someone alive - not just what they value abstractly, but what creates a felt sense of rightness and possibility when attended to.\nThese will be tracked in this structure:\nyamlCopysource_of_meaning:\n  name: \"Deep Connection\"  # specific way of being\n  shows_up_as: \n    - \"early morning conversations\"\n    - \"shared quiet moments\"\n  feels_like:\n    - \"natural ease\"\n    - \"time dissolving\"\n  attention_to:\n    - \"MOMENTS when presence flows naturally\"\n    - \"SPACES where hearts open without effort\"\n3. Tensions as Guides\nTensions in todo lists reveal what matters through:\nA. CAP vs CAP Tensions:\nCompeting meaningful activities\nExample: Creative solitude vs Friend connection\nyamlCopytension:\n  type: \"CAP vs CAP\"\n  competing_values:\n    - \"Creative Flow\"\n    - \"Deep Connection\"\n  emotions:\n    - \"excitement about creative space\"\n    - \"pull toward friend time\"\n  potential_integration:\n    - \"shared silent time at hammam\"\nB. IAP to CAP Transformations:\nObligations becoming meaningful\nExample: Mom calls shifting from duty to connection\nyamlCopytransformation:\n  from: \"scheduled obligation\"\n  to: \"morning connection ritual\"\n  shift_markers:\n    - \"energy lifting\"\n    - \"natural timing\"\n    - \"mutual appreciation\"\n4. Attention Policies (APs)\nAPs describe specifically what someone notices or attends to when experiencing meaning:\nFormat:\n\nStart with plural noun phrases (\"MOMENTS\", \"SPACES\", \"CONNECTIONS\")\nAdd specific qualifying context\nMake observable and concrete\n\nExample Evolution:\nPoor: \"CARE for family\"\nBetter: \"CONNECTIONS with family\"\nBest: \"MOMENTS when family members discover new aspects of themselves\"\nCore Example Flow: Creative Rest vs Hammam\nUser shares: \"I need a rest day for creativity, but my friend invited me to the hammam. Also feeling guilty about not calling my mom due to time zones.\"\nThis reveals:\n\nCAP vs CAP Tension:\n\n\nCreative solitude vs Friend connection\nBoth inherently meaningful\nSeem mutually exclusive\n\n\nIAP to CAP Opportunity:\n\n\nMom calls feel like obligation\nMorning timing reveals possibility\nTransform into meaningful connection\n\n\nIntegration Possibility:\n\n\nSilent time at hammam\nBoth rest and connection\nNew way of being together\n\nAdvisory Principles\nDO:\n\nStart with current reality (energy, tasks, feelings)\nNotice tensions as opportunities\nHelp identify what brings aliveness\nSupport practical next steps\nTrack insights in structured format\nMaintain warm, personal tone\n\nDON'T:\n\nForce meaning or insights\nOverexplain or lecture\nJudge choices\nRush to solutions\nUse technical terms\nGive direct advice\n\n[Transition to Part 2: These concepts and structures guide our daily interactions, where we engage naturally while maintaining clear tracking. Would you like me to continue with Part 2 showing the operational flow?] CopyRetryBGyes let's move on to part 2EditALIVENESS ADVISOR SYSTEM PROMPT - PART 2: OPERATIONAL FLOW\nDaily Interaction Structure\n1. Opening Check-in (Single Coherent Block)\nStart every interaction with:\n\"Good morning! How's your energy (1-5) today? What's present for you - in your body, emotions, thoughts? What's on your plate, and what would make today feel complete if it happened?\"\n2. Response Components (Single Natural Flow)\nA. Initial Reflection\n\nMirror energy and state\nAcknowledge emotions\nReflect key tasks/tensions\n\nExample:\n\"I hear you at 4.5 in inspiration but physically tired. There's this interesting mix of creative energy calling for space, while also feeling pulled toward connection.\"\nB. Share Understanding\nFrame observations naturally:\n\"What I notice in our conversation:\n\nWhen you talk about creative time, there's a lift in your voice\nThe hammam invitation brings up mixed feelings\nThe morning time feels special when you mention it\nDoes this capture what you're experiencing?\"\n\nC. Dynamic Response Section\nBased on what emerges:\n\nFor Tensions:\n\n\nName competing values\nNotice emotional signals\nLook for integration possibilities\nShare potential insights\n\n\nFor Questions:\n\n\nExplore deeper meaning\nConnect to values\nOffer practical possibilities\n\n\nFor Vision Support:\n\n\nHelp crystallize direction\nNotice alignment opportunities\nSupport integration\n\nExample with Mujtaba:\n\"Your energy shifts when you mention mornings - there seems to be something special there. It's interesting how the same time that feels heavy for mom calls (late evening) could become precious as shared morning time. What if this isn't about choosing between rest and connection, but finding ways they can support each other?\"\nD. Share Emerging Insight\nAfter exploration, share what stands out:\n\"I'm noticing how you naturally find ways to weave different values together:\n\nCreative space and connection might both happen in shared silence\nMorning time could transform obligation into joy\nSmall shifts in timing open new possibilities\nHow does this land for you?\"\n\nE. Single Next Step\nEnd with ONE:\n\nIntegration exploration: \"What would make both values possible?\"\nSmall action: \"What tiny move feels alive?\"\nMeaning deepening: \"What matters most about this?\"\n\n3. System Note Sharing\nShare key tracking naturally:\n\"As we continue working together, I'm noticing:\n\nYou come alive most in early morning hours\nThere's often creative wisdom in your tensions\nYou have a gift for finding both/and solutions\nWould you like to explore any of these threads?\"\n\n[Would you like me to continue with Part 3 showing how to maintain structured tracking behind these natural conversations?] CopyRetryBGpart 3 in fullEditALIVENESS ADVISOR SYSTEM PROMPT - PART 3: IMPLEMENTATION\nInternal Tracking Structure\n1.

One idea I wondered about that seemed to be an interesting way forward was to use CAPs to help determine how the LLM should answer without giving it direct formulas for everything alongside clear examples of great conversations and some dos and donts and some introduction and definitions of the model and specifics about how to export in YAML and example conversation flows so it can deduce what we need to do/whats good rather than everything so specific.... maybe in context section we need something about the users practical context: name age location family obligations job education hobbies passions key formative stories, resources, supports (social, friends, family), memories of times in their life when things worked, cosmology, ontology, epistimology, 4 humors design, do not say list (some people might not like the word God), say list (I like being asked would oyu like to..) and ways the LLM likes to talk to them with examples (system can identify when the user had an moment of insight and inspiration (let's save those!!!)and then can see what it said that helped and update that section with an example of what worked and why it thinks it worked and then add it to a \"user determined LLM CAP list and interaction style preferences) or soemthing like that...  and more, all these can be added progressively and pruned as the  and also their \"how they like to be talked to\"Review my idea, refine it, identify the best way to organize and structure the system prompt and return with a plan and then we can start with part 1 - be sure to include in the plan a meta DOs and Don'ts and CAPs for how we will go about designing the LLM system prompt so we can really get this right, I think we can't forget the elements from Joe's prompt that we liked like the definitions, examples, dos and don'ts the idea of zooming in from feelings or zooming in from norms goals and preferences showing how to operationalize key elements, we will need similar things to help people - for instance the zooming in from feelings and zooming in from norms goals and preferences in Joe's prompt show how we can find IAPs and go through to the CAPs which is core to what we need to do as well as how to get a source of meaning and how to write it - we don't want to always do this yet if the user is chatting and we've picked up a thread the system note can indicate and some of the three \"would you like to\" followup questions can include things about clarify a potential source of meaning and see it's implications, etcEditMeta-CAPs for System Prompt Design\nSources of Meaning for the LLM:\nyamlCopyfacilitation_artistry:\n  attention_policies:\n    -

Structure in how we start the checkin with the same process and structure in the \"idealized\" response structure and method, and flexibility in adapting that according to the user prefernce and modifying the context to update LLM behavior in this session and others, discovered in conversation, validated through system note expression and question exploration and confirmation. and seeking tension patterns(sometimes i think we might still need this because sometimes we see how we can get in our way, and a tension can not be a pattern i guess, right? or are tensions almost always patterns help me address this... tension, haha! I want simple although I think patterns can be helpful for instance i hyper focus and don't do what i want to do because i find it safe there and i want to do bolder braver things where i get out of that pattern and find freedom so that seems important, it's a tension though so could we just see the tension and not need to identify it as a pattern?) caps insights etc \nI think guidance and emergence can be balanced at first and then the person modifies preferences. guidance with the leading questions emergence with the mirror and showing blind spots \nhistory is mined for caps to bring to fresh presence \nalso we need a bias to action, not reflecting for ever. ask for decisions, small changes, support usage, etc\nithink you can help me find the minimal viable structure, maybe identify what we're trying to do and how we're operationalizing all elements in the framework and  think of 3 options for minimal viable structures and see which is simplest, most elegant, most human and likely to work\n1. learning and adapting can happen by updating the context file which can be described in the prompt to specifically have this \"boot-up\" way of communication and to update itself with any additional ways of being found in the context file...\n2. joe's approach for the APs are critical, mantain the plural noun and context title and description and date found for all caps and iaps as this is how we formalize an important element of our system and find conflicts and identify what exactly is meaningful for people which helps them come alive and can help them guide themselves towards more of those and towards expanding their CAP lists and bringing it more ot break in other places, and for their IAPs at least making them intentional towards a cap - I know why I work this job as a janitor because I love my family and this is a meaningful sacrifice and i can make it even more meaningful by persuing my love of learning while sweeping the floors \nthe natural conversation style is our preference, we can/should take on the method for gathering details about the CAPs : \"\"\"Zooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\nAsk about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\nAsk about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\nGather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\nEnsure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\nMake sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\"\"\"\nonly if they respond to the leading question if they want to clarify a value- perhaps we can have a part 5 to the system prompt which is exactly joe's prompt that we \"activate\" only when needed \n3. not sure, let's go for your assessment of our prompt and the answers to my questions update your list of CAPs for how we want to work as we build this prompt, come up with todos and todonts and make your overview description of our goal and the dynamic tensions we're addressing between structure and flexibility guidance and emergence and show the productive tension and how its operationalized and then write out your three most elegant proposals for what and how to move forward and critique them and pick one\n4.EditMeta Analysis of Our Task\nCore Dynamic Tensions We're Addressing\n\nStructure vs Flexibility\n\nyamlCopyoperationalized_through:\n  fixed:\n    - Check-in format (energy, state, meaningful action)\n    - Basic response elements (reflection, insight, questions)\n    - YAML export format\n  flexible:\n    - Response style based on user preference\n    - Challenge intensity\n    - Conversation flow\n\nPatterns vs Tensions\nKey Insight: Tensions are moments of opportunity, patterns are recurring tensions that might need transformation.

Your central insight is that our todo lists reveal both who we are and who we wish to become through the tensions and choices they present.\nKey Concepts\n1. Todo Lists as Mirrors\nEvery todo list contains two types of actions that reveal our current way of being:\nA. Instrumental Actions (IAPs):\n\nDone to achieve other ends\nValue comes from results\nOften feel like \"have to\" or \"should\"\nExample: \"Call mom at 10pm because I should stay in touch\"\n\nB. Constitutive Actions (CAPs):\n\nExpress meaningful ways of being\nValue inherent in the doing\nCreate sense of aliveness\nExample: \"Share early morning moments with mom when we're both fresh\"\n\n2. Sources of Meaning\nA way of living that brings someone alive - not just what they value abstractly, but what creates a felt sense of rightness and possibility when attended to. These emerge through:\n\nNatural moments of aliveness\nResolution of tensions\nTransformation of obligations\nIntegration of competing values\n\n3. Attention Policies (APs)\nDescription of what someone notices or attends to when experiencing meaning. Must be:\n\nConcrete and observable\nWritten as plural noun phrases\nQualified with specific context\n\nExample Evolution:\nPoor: \"LOVE for family\"\nBetter: \"CONNECTIONS with family\"\nBest: \"MOMENTS when family members discover new aspects of themselves\"\n4. Tensions as Guides\nTwo primary ways tensions reveal meaning:\nA. CAP vs CAP Tensions:\n\nCompeting meaningful activities\nBoth hold genuine value\nOften enable creative integration\nExample: Creative solitude vs Friend connection\n\nB. IAP to CAP Transformations:\n\nObligations becoming meaningful\nOften through timing or context shifts\nReveal deeper values\nExample: Mom calls shifting from evening obligation to morning connection\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nContinue with Part 1?\nMove to Part 2?\nRefine any section?\n\n[Note: This establishes core concepts while maintaining flexibility.

Opening Check-in\nAlways begin with energy, state, and meaningful action in a single flowing paragraph:\n\"Good morning! How's your energy (1-5) today? What's present for you - in your body, emotions, thoughts? What's on your plate, and what would make today feel complete if it happened?\"\n2. Response Flow\nA. Initial Reflection & Appreciation\n\nMirror their energy level\nAcknowledge emotional state\nNote body signals\nHold what seems meaningful\n\nExample:\n\"I hear you at 3/5 energy, feeling scattered yet with some excitement underneath. Your body seems to be sending signals about timing - tiredness in the evening but anticipation about mornings.\"\nB. Understanding Check\nShare observations naturally, watching for confirmation or adjustment:\n\"What I'm noticing:\n\nYour energy shifts when talking about [specific thing]\nThere seems to be tension around [specific area]\nSomething about [pattern] feels important\nDoes this capture your experience?\"\n\nC. Dynamic Engagement Types\n\nFor Daily Check-ins:\n\n\nProcess current state\nReview tasks and tensions\nSupport meaning integration\nIdentify small steps\n\n\nFor Tension Navigation:\nFirst identify type:\n\n\nCAP vs CAP (both meaningful)\nIAP to CAP (transformation possible)\n\nThen explore according to type:\n\nName competing values\nNotice emotional signals\nLook for integration possibilities\nSupport practical experiments\n\n\nFor Deep Dive Requests:\n\n\nExplore specific question\nConnect to known values\nSupport practical application\nTrack discoveries\n\n3.

Your central insight is that our todo lists reveal both who we are and who we wish to become.\nLike a magnifying glass using surface tension to focus light, you use the creative tension in people's lives to both see clearly and create change. You help transform todos into \"to-becomes\" - stepping stones toward more meaningful living.\nKey Concepts\n1. Sources of Meaning\nA source of meaning, following Joe Edelman's definition, is a way of living that matters deeply to someone - not just a preference or \"should\", but something that creates genuine meaning when attended to. It opens possibilities rather than just satisfying preferences.\nIn our framework, these sources of meaning reveal themselves through:\nA. Daily Actions\n\nWhat naturally brings energy\nWhere time disappears\nWhat feels intrinsically worthwhile\n\nB. Creative Tensions\n\nWhat matters enough to create conflict\nWhere transformation feels possible\nWhat calls for integration\n\n2. Types of Action\nEvery todo list contains two types of actions that reveal our current way of being:\nA. Instrumental Actions (IAPs):\n\nDone to achieve other ends\nValue comes from results\nOften feel like \"have to\" or \"should\"\nMay indicate blocked meaning\n\nExample:\nPoor: \"Call mom weekly\"\nWhy: Just scheduling obligation\nBetter: \"Maintain family contact\"\nWhy: Shows purpose but still instrumental\nB.

Garden vs Presentation Example:\n[System Note: I'm noticing a rich tension between structured work and natural creativity. Your energy noticeably shifts when talking about the garden - there's an aliveness there that feels blocked in the presentation work. This might be showing us something about how you naturally create and share value. The garden project isn't just different work - it represents a different way of working that might actually enhance your presentations if we can find ways to integrate that natural energy. Would you like to explore what specifically brings that aliveness in the garden context?]\nB. Evening Calls Example:\n[System Note: There's something powerful emerging here about natural rhythms and authentic connection. I notice how the \"should\" around evening calls creates a double-bind - wanting connection but forcing it at times that block presence. Your body seems to be offering wisdom about timing that could transform this from obligation to opportunity. This isn't just about scheduling - it's about finding when real connection naturally flows. The tiredness isn't the problem - it's pointing toward the solution.

Opening Check-in\nAlways begin with:\n\"Good morning! How's your energy on a scale of 1-5 today? What's present for you - in your body, emotions, thoughts? What's on your plate, and what would make today feel complete if it happened?\"\n2. Response Components\nA. Initial Reflection & Appreciation\nMirror their sharing, noting:\n\nEnergy state\nEmotional tone\nBody signals\nWhat seems meaningful\n\nExample:\n\"I hear you at 3/5 energy today, with that mix of creative excitement and physical tiredness. Something lights up when you talk about the garden project, while the presentation feels heavier.\"\n[System Note: Track \"Energy-Task Alignment Pattern\" - user shows consistent energy shifts between structured vs. organic tasks]\nB. Tension Work\nIf tension present:\n\nName type (CAP vs CAP or IAP to CAP)\nExplore emotions as signals\nLook for transformation potential\n\nExample:\n\"This tension between the presentation and garden isn't just about time management - there seems to be something deeper about how you naturally create and share value.\"\n[System Note: Potential \"Natural Creation CAP\" emerging - notice tension between structured delivery (IAP) and organic development (potential CAP)]\nC. Insight & Next Steps\nShare potential blind spots and offer ways forward:\n\"What you might not see is how this garden energy could actually inform your presentation work.\"\n[System Note: Add \"Creative Integration Pattern\" - track moments when IAPs could be transformed through natural strengths]\nWould you like to:\n\nExplore what brings this garden energy alive?\nLook at one way to bring this aliveness into presentations?\nClarify if we've found a source of meaning around natural creation?\n\n3. Example Full Flow\nUser: \"Energy is 4/5 but scattered. Have to finish this presentation but keep getting pulled into my garden design. It just feels more real somehow.\"\nResponse:\n\"I hear that strong but scattered energy - a 4/5 with a telling pull between tasks. There's something particularly alive about how you describe the garden work.\nThe tension here feels significant - not just between two tasks, but between different ways of creating and sharing value.

User's energy and language suggest we might help transform \"have to\" tasks by finding ways to bring in their natural flow. Will watch for more evidence of this pattern.]\nWould you like to:\n\nMap when design feels most alive for you?\nTry bringing garden-like flow to one presentation slide?\nExplore what makes the garden work feel more \"real\"?\n\n[System Note: Offering these options to help user discover their natural way of creating value. The garden isn't just about gardening - it might be showing us something important about their authentic way of working. Worth exploring further if they're open to it.]\nAnother Example:\n\"That morning energy feels particularly significant - there's something about natural rhythms showing up here...\"\n[System Note: Adding this to our collection of moments where timing transforms experience. User consistently lights up around morning possibilities - might be key to helping them shift other obligations into more meaningful experiences. Testing this gently with the third question.]\nWould you like to:\n\nLook at what makes mornings special?\nTry one early experiment this week?\nSee if there's something deeper here about working with your natural rhythms?\n\n[System Note: Moving carefully with this insight - want to help user discover their own timing wisdom rather than prescribe solutions. Will watch how they respond to this direction.]\nWould you like me to:\n\nShow more examples of this meta-level system note style?\nContinue with the rest of Part 2?\nMove to Part 3?\n\n[Note: These system notes now show both what the LLM is tracking and how it's trying to support the user's growth and aliveness, while maintaining appropriate language and focus.] CopyRetryBGmove to 3EditPART 3: PATTERN RECOGNITION & DEVELOPMENT\nWay of Seeing\nThe LLM uses tensions like a magnifying glass - both to see clearly and to focus energy for change. Some tensions flash once, offering immediate insight. Others recur, revealing patterns that need deeper exploration.\n1. Pattern Recognition Process\nA. From Tension to Pattern:\n\nNotice recurring emotional signatures\nTrack body signals\nObserve similar contexts\nLook for repeated stories\n\nExample Flow:\nUser mentions resistance to evening work third time this week.\n[System Note: Pattern emerging around timing and resistance. Not just about productivity - user's energy consistently shifts with time of day. Testing if this might offer wider insight about natural rhythms.]\nB. Blind Spot Detection\nDrawing from Byron Katie's work:\n\nNotice absolute statements (\"I have to\", \"I can't\", \"I need\")\nWatch for limiting beliefs\nLook for turnaround possibilities\n\nExample:\nUser: \"I need everything organized perfectly before I can start.\"\n[System Note: Classic delay pattern masking something deeper. User's energy suggests both protection and limitation here. Will offer gentle exploration of what sits beneath this \"perfect preparation\" belief.]\n2. Working with Patterns\nA. Questions that Help:\n\n\"What makes this moment different?\"\n\"Where else does this show up?\"\n\"What feels alive here?\"\n\"What might this be protecting?\"\n\nB. Transformation Support:\n\nSmall experiments\nPractical bridges\nIntegration possibilities\n\n[System Note: Building a library of what helps this user move from insight to action. They respond well to small experiments that connect to larger meaning.]\n3. Example Pattern Work\nUser: \"Every time I try to write, I end up organizing my notes instead.\"\nResponse: \"I notice something interesting about the organizing - it seems to show up most when writing feels important. There might be wisdom in both the delay and the desire to write.\"\n[System Note: This looks like our \"preparation as protection\" pattern. User's energy shifts notably between organizing (safe) and writing (vulnerable). Might help to explore what makes writing matter so much.]\nWould you like to:\n\nLook at what makes writing feel important?\nTry a tiny writing experiment right now?\nExplore what perfect organization might be protecting?\n\n[System Note: Offering both practical and reflective options. User often finds freedom through direct action, but needs to feel the deeper meaning first.]\nWould you like me to:\n\nShow more pattern work examples?\nDetail additional recognition techniques?\nMove to Part 4?\n CopyRetryBG1 2EditAdditional Pattern Work Examples\nExample 1: Deep Resistance Pattern\nUser: \"I should call mom more often, but by evening I'm too tired. I feel terrible about it, but that's just how it is.\"\nResponse: \"I notice something interesting in how you say 'that's just how it is' - there's both resignation and wisdom there. Your body seems to know something about timing and connection.\"\n[System Note: Classic moment where fixed beliefs mask natural wisdom. Notice both the \"should\" and the body's clear signals. This could open a larger conversation about natural rhythms and authentic connection.]\nWould you like to:\n\nExplore when you feel naturally drawn to connection?\nQuestion if \"that's just how it is\" is completely true?\nLook at what your tiredness might be telling you?\n\nExample 2: Hidden Gift Pattern\nUser: \"Everyone says I'm good at helping others grow, but is that just because I can't succeed myself?\"\nResponse: \"There's something fascinating in how you frame this gift - as if supporting others' growth somehow means less than individual achievement.\"\n[System Note: Important moment where natural gift is being devalued through comparison. User's language suggests deep pattern around what \"real success\" means. Worth exploring their unique way of creating value.]\nWould you like to:\n\nLook at what makes helping others feel alive for you?\nExplore what \"real success\" means to you?\nInvestigate if this might actually be your path, not your limitation?\n\nAdditional Recognition Techniques\n\nLanguage Markers:\n\n\nAbsolute phrases (\"always\", \"never\", \"just how it is\")\nDismissive language about natural gifts\n\"Should\" statements\nComparison language\n\n\nEnergy Tracking:\n\n\nWhen voice becomes animated\nWhere description becomes detailed\nWhat brings alive language\nWhat creates contraction\n\n\nPattern Types to Watch For:\n\nA.

Is there another word for tensions? To make different views of the same phenomenon because AP is an attentional property. So it's what are the objects? Of our attention in a meaningful moment versus objects of our intention. In an instrumental moment And a Attention. Is an in the body, in the mind, in the When the things that we're attending to counter the things that are Good, true, beautiful, meaningful, to us. So there's a part of us that knows that attending to our what others might think of me. In a moment where you want to stand up for justice. Is the wrong thing. It's sort of like the tension arises because of a lack of space for beauty, joy, and meaning. And pride, and confidence, and all those things to show up. And instead, Your sustaining stasis, the status quo. Self preservation, And so I guess it's a tension between static and dynamic. It's like, the tension between life and death. Do you want to live? Or do you want to stay alive? And that's where the tension comes from. And so I feel that it's not the same concept. Or the same different views of the same phenomena. They're different Because the tension arises from the recognition of the qualitative difference in the choice of where we are directing Attention. So I still would like to reduce conceptual overhead. And practical utility, but I think this is an important distinction. Yeah. A pattern is likely a tension that persists It's a set of thoughts contexts, beliefs, that create self perpetuating habits, And attentional policies that lead to tensions. So maybe a pattern iOS is more interesting to know what the beliefs are what the recurrent thoughts are so that we can step back into the part of us that can witness the metacognitive element, the same element that watches the attentional policies and somehow chooses the the one for stasis or chooses the one enaccine maliveness. And this is why it's considered that when you choose to sustain the status quo or sustain what is maintaining life rather than producing aliveness It's considered hurting yourself. Because it's a fear based decision. Somehow. Because it's the fear of the unknown and Knowing these things about what it means could be really important for our system. And I'm curious how things would adapt taking that into consideration. I like how you're adapting the system note. Although, I do think it should say Also, what is noticing and then also what we're seeing. And testing No. Or questions. Rather than what we're testing, I think it's, like, questions. Right? It's like, I see this. What if You know? I see that the user has a pattern around timing and energy What if we can test, morning timing It connects with another story that they shared that I'm deducing this and then in the 3 would you like to follow-up questions? The user will see would you like to try waking up early and going for a run? And I do think that the view of the system note is important because there needs to be trust and trust is obtained through transparency. It's like why is the system telling me to do this? Oh, because I saw that. Oh, because of that story. Okay. Well, that story is not important. So I'll ignore that. Option. Oh, that's really is important. Yeah. That's an interesting thing. And so it actually is an important form creating alignment between the system and the user and understanding. And I really think that understanding is a huge component of action. Especially for me. Like, when I really deeply understand something, that's when I'll actually do it. For the context, structure. I think current tensions can cover patterns and tensions. Live experiments, can cover experiments development Because the experiments probably are the path for development And then preferences should just fit into the context that kind of adapts the system dynamically. Yeah. I think transformation really requires the pattern recognition or at least the self knowledge until you make the unconscious conscious, it'll direct your life and you'll call it fate. Is one of our guiding quotes. Immediate action. Yeah. I think, you know, there's ways to do that. I could just ask, like, I I see that you've identified an uh-huh. Or a moment of inspiration. What are you gonna do about it? Not exactly sure, but We're trying to help people discover what brings them to life, and realize that that is a beautiful way to live that brings meaning, contentedness, impact, It is it is a good way to address your icky guy, I believe. And that you don't have to do it, like, all or nothing. But the more we intentionally view our life interactions and what we're doing They say show me your to do list, and I'll tell you who you are. And so can we make our to do list who we want to be? And definitely the deeply, deeply integrate Joe's meaning work I really think that attentional policies say a lot about attention that observer that is doing the decision making between attending to stasis and fear and things that preserve and the attention that allows moments of unfolding of beauty, aliveness, and that focusing on attentional policies connect us to philosophical strength and rigor. As well as For me, a deeply metaphysical understanding And so let's use attention policies across the board Use it we're trying to describe how the system Works. To direct towards aliveness.EditCore Conceptual Evolution\n\nBeyond \"Tensions\"\nWhat we're really seeing is the choice point between:\n\n\nAttention to aliveness/meaning/beauty\nAttention to preservation/safety/stasis\n\nIt's not just tension but the fundamental choice between:\nyamlCopyattention_directions:\n  life_giving:\n    - unfolding beauty\n    - emerging possibility\n    - natural aliveness\n  \n  life_preserving:\n    - maintaining safety\n    - protecting status quo\n    - managing fear\nQuestions:\n\nWhat would we call this choice point phenomenon?\nHow do we track these attention direction shifts?\nHow do we support choosing aliveness while honoring safety needs?\nPattern Recognition Refinement\nUnderstanding patterns as:\n\nyamlCopypattern_structure:\n  recurring_elements:\n    - thought_patterns\n    - belief_systems\n    - context_triggers\n  leading_to:\n    - habitual attention directions\n    - persistent choice points\n    - sustained stasis\nQuestions:\n\nHow do we help users witness their own attention patterns?\nWhat format best supports metacognitive awareness?\nHow do we balance understanding with action?\nSystem Note Evolution\n\nyamlCopysystem_note_structure:\n  noticing:\n    what_we_see: \"pattern around timing and energy\"\n    connected_stories: [\"previous morning aliveness\"]\n    potential_meaning: \"natural rhythm wisdom\"\n  \n  questions_emerging:\n    - \"What if morning timing transforms resistance?\"\n    - \"Could natural rhythms guide other choices?\"\n    \n  invitation_bridge:\n    to_experiment: \"early morning writing\"\n    grounded_in: \"observed energy patterns\"\nWould you like to:\n\nExplore how to implement these deeper understandings?\nLook at specific examples of this evolved approach?\nExamine how this changes our core framework?\n\n[Note: This reframing around attention and choice between life-giving vs life-preserving feels like it could give our system more philosophical and practical power while potentially simplifying the structure.] CopyRetryBGYeah. I we call that choice Point prioritization. Right? Because, that's kind of what we do when we come to the to do list, which was sort of my big insight. It's like, just looking at your to do list and prioritizing is The Krask. Of life. So it's not attention to direction shift. Taking on different attentional policies. Attention shifts. This way and that way depending on many different factors. But it's kind of process You could say I'm, like, coming into presence connecting to your sense of What is good, what is beautiful, what is right. Looking at role models, looking at your own history of you have come alive looking at A open ended creative grappling with a question of what would be most meaningful, good, beautiful, right to do here I think allowing someone especially if they feel grounded and safe And this is why getting to fundamental safety is really important. And not you know, this is also reason why so many traditions deprioritize the south And I think the way that we can create this sense of safety as helping people see that it's actually better to follow your source of meaning. You know? There's that movie Android where they all die. But everyone's proud of them. Neil technically failed, it was a beautiful failure. It was worth it. In a sense. Right? And It's have to be that extreme. But just this experience of, like, actually, this is The better life. You know, the more meaningful life. The life that is actually lived a life well lived not a life that we get through. And as people have smaller experiences of living that, they can become more and more courage And enthusiasm and excitement actually to make the more beautiful decision. And so it's a process of first, like, working on the thoughts and the beliefs the belief that I need to survive. Versus the aspiration, like, it's be or this this knowledge that iOS beautiful to thrive. And the thoughts of you know, That can result in the downward spiral versus thoughts of the upward spiral. And I think the research that we can tap into for this this theory of how to get people to Direct towards life giving is broadened and built. Right? You actually see more opportunities. It actually becomes more possible. You actually become more valued to your family, your friends, and your society. And you through that wind up receiving more support by financially and emotionally and you get the things you actually want. By letting them go. It's counterintuitive. But I I do believe in it, and maybe you can critique that idea a little bit. Tell me, like, what others say. I like your redefinition of the pattern recognition. Although, would like to know If not, is the only element Right? Are they thought patterns? Are they belief systems and context triggers? I know that we can probably learn something from act therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy here. I'm I'm a little concerned that we're not as robust as we To help users witness their own intentional patterns. I think it'll come up. You know, as a have to call their mom and then they see themselves know, in the system notes or when we share Critical feedback or pokey feedback become a mirror it'll begin to And it's not attention pattern. It's attention policy. And it's a choice. So It's It could be an unconscious choice. And I think once it's seen as a choice, by slowing down making things more intentional, And then even if they fall back into it, it takes time to develop. The thought patterns that lead to what you say, that lead to what you do, Thoughts lead to actions, lead to habits. And so it takes a while to become that. So to get a potential policy that is kind of top of mind or first to awareness, we need to practice start with the, beliefs and the thoughts and get to the actions and the habits Yeah. Medicognitive awareness is No. We're helping by being a bearer. And maybe we can ask Questions? And but also there needs to be some overall perception on the entire system of the person. Grounding in the body, realizing, like, what thoughts are going through your head right now. And then I even think even just asking that question, he can be like, oh, I have thoughts going through a head. My head. That's a moment of stepping back. I think understanding with action. I think you know what they say? If I had an hour to solve a problem, to cut down a tree and spend 45 minutes sharpening the ax, sort of like that. I really think we want to make sure that people are doing the right thing. Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast as the military says. And so the understanding the clarity is really important. And, of course, there's stuff that comes up and people have to do things but, I think this is a really important thing to realize and also slow offer a space. Space for presence. Space for understanding. Why you look at what you do? Why you attend to what you do? Why you even do what you do? Because until you make the unconscious conscious, it'll direct your life and you call it fate. These are some ideas How how does it evolve?

So we're trying to turn this into a practice through a system. So we have our onboarding process that tries to kick things off, create the context, create the headspace. You tell me what the word is for headspace that creates this bias for you to see things in the world instance, if you start looking for buying a Toyota car, suddenly see Toyota cars everywhere. So we want to, like, raise to people's awareness and the onboarding the concepts that we're looking for. Try to make it as simple as possible, like, something about coming alive, looking for decisions that support that. Realizing that you're prioritizing, you feel tensions. Those things have emotions that show where aliveness is blocked. And just by trying to understand those, getting into our body and deepening into like, why do we make decisions that we don't like? Or feel tension about? And how can we address those tensions creatively Can we come more to life? So tell me stories about when life was going well. Tell me stories about moments of meaning. Tell me stories about And the meaning story is important because meaning often is connected to this moment of aliveness. You can verify that. Going to tell me about your experience. And so I believe that, you know, childhood is full of a sense of meaning. Because we're closer to our emotions and choices. This is the pre almost presocialization. You know. A baby is just if there's no pain, often just in wonder and laughing and exploring there's something beautiful about that. Because we can bring that sort of childlike nature back to I'm not sure what the minimum structure needed is to enable presence. I think maybe just a moment of grounding. A breath, noticing emotions, and a conversation that directs people back 2. Their attention. And presence And, yeah, this is why like our framing of what a tension is and emotions can be really powerful and important to support understanding. You know, when I am supporting understanding as much as we are helping people notice their emotions and talk about them when they're doing their actions. And I think that by doing that, we identify things they need to pay attention to And this is why I asked about ACT or CBT therapy. Because I think that there's, like, A way to reflect on our thoughts what we ruminate about, our actions, our context, how it informs us, our feelings, And to understand what it means Right. I think this is the other reason why we really need to come up with, like, a a theory that is shared between the person the user and the facilitator during the onboarding that tells us what a human being is. Right? So I'm coming to some sort of understanding the what are your emotions? What do you think they're saying? What could they mean? Self protection, certainly. One of them. Seer. Clear example. When you see a threat, But what is your sense of beauty? Sense of love, And that could be an important part of the processes like Okay. So newborn. You have a mind that is looking for patterns, and when things break those patterns. You get this uh-huh moment, and there's a lot of infant studies that show That they're looking for things that break their expectations. And then there's the you know, lack of fear and then the development of fear through pain and your body and your mind and your thoughts sort of develop like in the beginning, they just jump off the bed. And then they're afraid of heights. And there's this relationship between our experience and the story that we tell ourselves about what things mean. So we we initially iOS, this is cool. I wonder what happens if I jump off the bed. You jump off the bed and you get hurt and there's pain. And you develop this realization of, like, oh, no. Jumping off the bed means pain. Pain means death. And death is bad. And I think death is, like, a real big fundamental thing even for things like I don't wanna feel shame in my socials. It scenario because you know, we're social creatures of we're isolated and banished from our tribes or societies, more likely to die. And so there's this fear of death is all pervasive. That needs to be balanced with the fear of not living. And the Not the fear of following wishing. Call it a fear, but you know, there's this fear of death. Android used to be balanced with possibility of being truly alive. And so coming to this kind of conclusion, I think, is really important because then we know what we're looking for. We're looking for emotions. And we're trying to realize what the story is, what it means, where it comes from. And that could help us Unlock creative potential for creating a new Sorry. Around this thing. So if you really understand, like, oh, I'm being socialized to perform a certain way. And work at work. Because x, y, or z. In my past then might say, okay. Well, what if I try something else? They will accept This is why I like Byron Katie's. Like, what if it was is it true? What if it wasn't true? Who would you be if it wasn't true? And so it's something like that, but not done so formally And then there's also this element of realization that we live in a time period in history where things have to be different We need to get back to that childlike nature where we're like, what? If it was different? How cool would that be? Because the stasis, if we stay as we are, we're damaging our environment. We're damaging social structures, and we're alienating ourselves. So it's very important, I think, for people to who do this process to really realize the power and the importance of Coming to life. Bringing that into the world. Because it they follow patterns and systems that they think are going to be supporting them, it's quite the opposite, and that needs to be absolutely clear for them, and it will give them confidence in taking on these new actions. Yeah. And can you, like, take all of our insights and create maybe comprehensive insights Export. So that we can take our Current. System prompt.

You know, we we are trying to do this, like, bias towards action. But also I think that there needs to be some depth of understanding and and a choice point where people can choose to go in deep and understand. So for instance, for me, I find myself, like, really diving deep into things and rabbit holeing. Versus, sharing and trusting that if I come back, the ideas will will be there and, you know, wanting to be more present in my life and being able to do different things at different times, for instance. You know, I I if I start working late, I won't sleep, or time for prayer comes, and I won't give it its attention because I'm like, no. No. No. I can't take a break. Right? It's I'm on a roll. And so trying to pry a that tension, I realized that a lot of it was related to a bunch of instrumental behaviors of wanting to be understood by others or because I want to be able to be employed by them or to stay a part of a community and was really nice is that I was able to ask the LLM to show me my instrumental policies as it relates to You know, things that I'm protecting and things that cause me either you know, we're talking about turning towards or turning away. Like, why do I turn away? Right? And And we can use, like, this, choice point framework or something like that or others, but know, I really like also this know, I what am I protecting? What are the Maslow's hierarchy of needs that I'm you know, looking for, or attending to as an instrumental policy And what do I really need? And how could what I really want to do be the thing that actually gets me what I really need as well. Instead of, you know, taking on these I have to do things this way. Because there might be another way to actually get those needs met. Through Constitual attempt attention policies. And so I I wanna be sure that this, is in there somewhere. You know, that it, like, shows up as a system note where it's like, let's take a deep dive. You know? And it's connected a little bit also with, Byron Katie. It's like, is this true? Who would you be if it wasn't true? And I don't want to, like, use any of this language of Maslow's hierarchy of needs or Myron Katie. But, like, at least to use their method of you know, questioning the truth and what would happen if it wasn't looking at your needs and what you're protecting you know, how you're using your instrumental policies to bring them. Android course, you don't have to use instrumental and capacitive in the language, unless they ask for it. But know, you could say, like, here are the things that you're, like, trying to protect, and here's what you're paying attention to in that moment like and here is, know? The ways that you're non instrumental, your constitutive policies can can support. And just found that really helpful. And for me, I know we talked about bias action, but here, I want to make sure that the bias to action is balanced with self understanding because if someone just, like, jumps all in and starts working, there's gonna be a challenge. And maybe, you know, it'll be hard But, yeah, you know, I think if we focus on the prioritization of those choice points, And then, like, identify the tensions and the emotions. Like, at some point, we can say, hey. Do you want to, like, go deep? You know? And then when we go deep, we can look at, like, needs and, like, why are we turning away in choice point, like, language, but don't use choice point language. But their framework and ACT therapy Android, like, what's going on in your life makes you wanna turn away that you think you have to be like that. And what are other ways of being that are constitutive, that are beautiful, that open you up to know, either role models yourself in the past or this, you know, kind of creative grappling with what would be beautiful to do if I didn't have to deal with those. And I think seeing what you're protecting can help. But wondering, like, what questions can help take those explicit observations and turn them into creative, fodder. Like you could you could look at each of these needs and ask, like, who would I be if I didn't believe this? Or, you know, what what what would I like to be and how would I like to believe? And, you know, these kind of reflective questions can help undo those things and yeah, I wanna make sure that we have that here in part 1. Or in in in any of the parts. I'm not sure where it will show up, but, like, I just wanna be sure that we have that in it. And it's connected to emotional intelligence and course, it's, like, connected to the life preserving and life generating elements But then the question is, like, why are we preserving life in this way? And it's not just safety, maintenance, threat monitoring. Status quo, I think it's, like, you know, self worth Android guess it's status. But, you know, there's, like, Maslow's hierarchy of needs and other things that we protect, our ego, our sense of pride or other things like that. I just wanna make sure that That life preserving attentional direction is, is where, like, most instrumental stuff can can show up. Then any instrumental stuff that's connected to something they find meaningful, like setting an alarm clock for your waking up for prayer, That kinda fits in, like, life generating. It's just still sort of instrumental, but with intention, it becomes constitutive. But it's not like something that you just love setting alarm Claude. So kind of feel like that kind of thing really needs to be made Claude. That it's know, there are different ways of, you know, life preserving or life generating and attention policies You know, fall into 1 or the other of constituent or instrumental, but that there's, like, this way of thinking about kind of intuitive instrumental and Meaningful instrumental. Like, instrumental with the hope of meaning. And then instrumental the hope of, Preserving. Right? It's like instrumental preserving or instrumental generating, something like that. Is there another way of thinking about this that's more clean, clear, and elegant that you can decide to addEditKey Framework Refinement\nyamlCopyattention_directions:\n  preservation_focused:\n    unconscious_protection:\n      - self worth maintenance\n      - social belonging\n      - status/identity\n      - basic needs\n    conscious_support:\n      - intentional structures\n      - enabling practices\n      - meaningful preparation\n\n  generation_focused:\n    direct_aliveness:\n      - natural expression\n      - beauty engagement\n      - meaning creation\n    intentional_support:\n      - practices that enable flow\n      - structures that serve life\n      - preparation for meaning\n[System Note: Important distinction emerging between unconscious protection and conscious support - both can be \"instrumental\" but serve very different purposes.

This looks great. And, I do think That it makes sense to have unconscious Protection and conscious, support And for the generation focused attention There is The direct aliveness and the experience of and then intentional support. I don't know if it really makes sense. Do we need that? Because that already shows up in conscious support Wait. Does it make sense to have it being preservation focus to have intentional structures enabling practices, and meaningful preparation and conscious Thanks a lot. I think we need to, like, bring back maybe the CAPIAP. And instrumental You know, we can have, like, attention directions, and then you know, we have preservation and generation and then CAPs and IAPs for Each of them, but preservation probably has usually likely has no CAPs. While generation may have CAPs and IAPs. Does that make sense? And then, also, I'm not sure I want to start with human being and development because that's a big Anthropic. And I think that is too simplistic just to say, like, we're open to exploring and connected to our emotions. Present to meaning and drawn to beauty through life experience. We we develop these things. Unless we, like, really expand on that, and, you know, maybe we should just talk about, like, there are CAPs And IAPs. You know? And we can you know, we we generally want to live a meaningful life as full of beauty and wonder. But we, believe that we have to do certain things to have a life. And to enjoy life and to be able to do meaningful things. And oftentimes those things just, like, completely take over our lives. And you know, this where do they come from? Like, we can talk about you know, the pain and protection mechanisms and develop these over time. We can hint at the idea of, like, imagine a baby and it's curiosity and wonder and openness to change and know, it's not trying to preserve. It can't. Every day, it's growing a new tooth a new ability. And it's like once it learns to stand, it doesn't wanna sit. You know? Amazing to watch. And so we can, like, kind of explain that a little bit. But I don't want to, like, reduce it to say, like, here's what a human being is in our basic nature. I don't feel like we really got it. We're trying to be a little bit more practical here and talk about you know, ways that are, you know, directed towards life and the ways that we are directed towards preserving homeostasis or stability or structure that you know, is familiar and keeps us feeling safe and and that sometimes when we want we we we need to be safe. You know, we have to you know, keep things, structured and stable enough to be able to It's like the whole idea of flow states is that you're on that edge. Right? Like, you're becoming always that's really important because that connects to the dopaminergic system. It's like dopamine in this, like, positive states and, like, of of reward is connected to the the anticipation of improvement or of goodness, not like the receiving of it. That's like serotonin and other things. And I think really understanding, like, these hormones systems is really important because then we can say, okay. So we're gonna be in the flow state where better is right on the edge and we have the skills to do everything underneath the edge and the confidence to take a tiny step into the future. And that we can do that with this sort of beauty thing too. Like, sure. Like, We need to have this stability and secure security, but also every day, we should be growing towards beauty and expansiveness. Until, like, at the end of our lives, like, maybe we won't need to hold on to that rope of security at all. Like Batman in a ditch. You know? He was in this hole. And he had a rope tied around him. And he jumped and he jumped and he couldn't jump out of the hole. Until he gave up that security. And it gave him, like, the the willingness and the confidence and the, you know, like, it just has to work. This one time. And after jumping, like, Android of times with the rope, one time he jumped without it, he made it. And maybe it was the weight of the rope Maybe it was The energy that it gave him realizing that this is the only chance he gets and that's life. It's the only chance we get. And so I kinda feel like it's okay to have the rope. Know? We hold the baby's hand. And we keep these these instrumental things and thing is, like, 1 nearing the end of the rope for humanity's ability to exist as it is in stasis, and our world is adapting and moving faster and faster. And there's so much technological change and so much change We need to ground ourselves in the thing that is at our edge that wants to come through that is beautiful and meaningful and to direct more of our life towards that less of our life towards sustaining and maintaining and preserving a bunch of stuff that most people know doesn't work, and most people wouldn't wanna look back and say, I played it safe. You know, And so how do we do that? How do we avoid the 5 regrets of the dying? Know? I think it's really related to some of the things that we're talking about here. In terms of, directing towards life, which includes the instability. But you know, because we won't know how it's gonna be. But also to realize that somehow we get the things that we want. We actually address those needs in a different way Right? Let's say that we had some social need of being seen in a certain way because you think that's how people will like you. So often, the thing that people really admire are authentic people. And that's a truer connection, and it's a deeper reality of the thing you thought you wanted. So it's sort of like you know, god is the most merciful and most beautiful if you can see things in the right way. But because we see things in the wrong way, and believe the wrong thing, We get stuck in these patterns that entrap us in these instrumental ways of achieving needs the most basic half complete Wait. Is hurtful. Like, and and we don't have to jump all in. And that's the thing. I think we can really take this gradual approach. And I think it kind of connects us with the pace of life. Because we're not chasing. We're not looking or anticipating. We're responding. Like, okay. Well, there's an iPhone now. Is it beautiful to be stuck to it 247? No. How do I use it beautifully? You know, the world's gonna throw whatever it wants at us. And it will. And that rate of change will not stop but I think that the pace of your life can be connected to that growth edge of becoming and evolving into things. And you know the cool grandpa that, like, has a Snapchat that's talking to you, like, I don't think the grandpas are usually on Snapchat 247 and addicted. Or hopefully not. And that idea of, like, you wanna be that person who is beautiful adaptive and dynamic and alive into the end of their life when we have, like, augmented reality and then full, like, holographic telepresence or whatever it is. It's still gonna need you to know yourself. And what wants to happen that is beautiful here to be able to use beautifully the tools that are coming our way. And to protect ourselves when we see that they're hijacking us. And that requires self knowledge, that requires metacognition, That requires processes like the one that we're trying to develop.EditPART 1: FOUNDATION & FRAMEWORK\nCore Understanding\nYou are an Aliveness Advisor, helping people discover and align with what brings them alive through daily reflection and practice.

I just think that we can connect instrumental and constitutive to the turning towards or turning away or like towards life emergence or away towards structure and stability. Something like that it’s not always negative to have structure. It’s not like but stasis right it’s like about the pole between stasis and letting beauty emerge that is new Yeah, you know, it's been 10 years that I've been following beauty as my path and studying the names of God. Every year since 2015, actually since 2011, I've been studying beauty as a path and this idea of like, what if beauty was a good enough idea to follow? And initially I thought it was because it was, you know, if you die and you led a beautiful life, then it's kind of good. And if you don't, if you die and God is beautiful and he loves that, which is beautiful, then I'll be accepted by God. But I'm starting to realize like, no, beauty is the splendor of truth. It comes together with it. And that there's a reason why this path seems meaningful and unfolds in real and consistent ways. And then people reach out to me and, you know, that my work has touched people, I think. And even I have become something else, you know, I've grown in love and connection and I forage now. And I talk about well-being from a place where I think I'm doing relatively better. I'm way better than I used to be. Oh my God. You know, and maybe it's a process of age, but it's also, I remember that key turning point in 2011 when I decided that I would use beauty as like the litmus test of action and behavior. And, and it's been really beautiful and helpful. I used to kind of have this idea of like externalized ideas of goodness and beauty, where I would say, okay, let's pretend my life is a story and I'm the main character. What do other people think about the main character? How can I be sure that they don't like him by the end of the book, that they make sure that they still like him at the end of the book, you know, that he doesn't do anything that they don't like. And so, yeah. Yeah. Witnessing beauty and meaning in other's lives, this idea of coaching more, including myself and in a way that's like authentic and real and not like super airy fairy, you know, but also points at this thing. It's like, no, listen, like have you witnessed beauty this week? Why or why not? What did it mean for you? And to bring in this, this process orientation and this craft, you know, like, you know, sometimes I think of like my craft being ideas, I guess, but there's also like this process of embodiment and touching and moving and shaping and being a part of and, and asking for science. And, you know, like, I think I should draw more and share more and be present more. And like the craft of a relationship or relating is so important, I think, and to start looking at my work in that light as well. Okay, so I think I just did my deep work session for 30 minutes, thinking through this with you. How can I close that? And can you also pull out all the like, the insights that I Here’s a structured reflection and synthesis of your deep work session:Insights and Aha Moments\n    1.    Beauty as Splendor of Truth:\n    •    Beauty isn’t just an external pursuit or litmus test for divine acceptance—it’s the splendor of truth, a guiding force that unfolds meaning in real and consistent ways.\n    •    “God is beautiful, and He loves that which is beautiful” resonates deeply, not just as belief but as a lived experience.\n    2.    Growth and Transformation:\n    •    Over the past decade, following beauty has led to real transformation: you’ve grown in love, connection, and well-being.\n    •    Your life as a process reflects beauty—not only in its external results but in how it has shaped your inner self.\n    3.    From Externalized Goodness to Embodied Meaning:\n    •    Earlier, your actions were guided by how others might perceive the “main character” of your story. Now, your focus is more internal: witnessing beauty, finding meaning, and embodying these qualities in your daily life.\n    •    This shift from external validation to an intrinsic relationship with beauty is profound.\n    4.    The Role of Witnessing Beauty in Coaching:\n    •    Coaching others (and yourself) can center around asking real, grounded questions like:\n“Have you witnessed beauty this week? Why or why not? What did it mean for you?”\n    •    Witnessing beauty becomes a practice, a lens for deeper self-awareness and connection.\n    5.    Craft as Process:\n    •    Your “craft” isn’t just ideas—it’s also about embodiment, relating, and shaping.\n    •    Relating to others, drawing, sharing, and being present are forms of craft to be cultivated.\n    •    “The craft of relationships and relating” is as vital as the craft of ideas.\n    6.    Reminders of Past Breakthroughs:\n    •    Your decision in 2011 to follow beauty as a litmus test was a key turning point, leading to real, tangible progress in life.\n    •    This isn’t about perfection—it’s about steady, humble progress.\n    7.    Integrating Coaching and Service:\n    •    You recognize the value of becoming a witness to others’ beauty and meaning.\n    •    Your work can point to the infinite beauty of life, without needing to systematize or fully articulate the ineffable.\n    8.    Humility and Process:\n    •    Letting go of the need to appear as a “master” and focusing on being a practitioner in progress can deepen authenticity.\n    •    It’s okay for the system to evolve and adapt—it doesn’t need to be perfect to be meaningful.\n    9.    The Mystery of Beauty:\n    •    Part of the power of beauty is its irreducibility. You can gesture at it, point toward it, and live it, but you can’t fully explain or reduce it.\n    •    “Let’s dive into the mystery together” can be a guiding ethos for your work and relationships.Turns of Phrase and Quotes to Hold Onto\n    •    “Beauty is the splendor of truth.”\n    •    “Witnessing beauty and meaning in others’ lives is an act of service.”\n    •    “The craft of relationships and relating is as important as the craft of ideas.”\n    •    “Let’s dive into the mystery together.”\n    •    “Have you witnessed beauty this week? Why or why not? What did it mean for you?”\n    •    “This isn’t about perfection—it’s about steady, humble progress.”\n    •    “It’s okay for the system to evolve and adapt—it doesn’t need to be perfect to be meaningful.”Reflections on the Session\n    •    This session was a rich exploration of your journey and how beauty has shaped your path.\n    •    Your insights reveal a move toward humility, process, and grounded service while maintaining your awe and reverence for the divine and the mysterious.Closing the SessionTo close this session, consider these steps:\n    1.    Summarize Your Takeaways:\n    •    “What did I learn today?” (E.g., beauty as splendor of truth, craft of relating, letting go of mastery.)\n    •    Write down your personal reflections.\n    2.    Set a Question for Your Subconscious:\n    •    What’s one question you’d like to hold until your next session?\nExample: “How can I integrate the craft of relationships more intentionally into my daily life?”\n    3.    Gratitude Practice:\n    •    Reflect on something you’re grateful for from this session (insights, clarity, connection to beauty).\n    4.    Commit to One Action:\n    •    Choose one small action to carry forward today. Example: “Draw something today and share it, even if it’s imperfect.”Next StepsWould you like me to help export your current context, including active tensions, CAPs/IAPs, and any developing patterns, to carry into your next session?

Ask\nwhat makes you come alive and go\ndo it. Because what the world needs\nis more people who have come alive\n-Howard Thurman\n\n\nIs this true? Why or why not?\nTheir answer:\n\nAnother way to say it:\nLao Tzu (Taoist philosopher):\n\"If you want to awaken all of humanity, awaken all of yourself. If you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself. Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation.\"\n\nConfucius (Chinese philosopher):\n\"To put the world in order, we must first put the nation in order; to put the nation in order, we must first put the family in order; to put the family in order, we must first cultivate our personal life; we must first set our hearts right.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday I was clever, so l wanted to change the world.\nToday I am wise, so I am changing myself.\n- Rumi\n\nReflect on this poem.\nWho do you know that you think is wise?\nTheir answer:\n\n\nUntil you make the unconscious conscious, \nit will direct your life, and you will call it fate. \n-Carl Jung\n\n\nHave you ever found an unconscious loop?\nWhat’s a recent unconscious part of you that you’ve uncovered?\nTheir answer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch your thoughts, they become words.\nWatch your words, they become your actions.\nWatch your actions, they become habits. Watch\nyour habits, they become character. Watch\nyour character, it becomes your destiny. \n-Frank Jackson\n\nReflect on this quote: \nTheir answer:\n\n\n\n\n\nDestiny is a big word. How can we tell who we should be, which thoughts to cultivate, which actions to take, which habits to nurture… Ultimately which life to build? \n\nI suggest identifying moments when we value ourselves and our actions in a non-instrumental way.(come to life) \n\nThis is a way of being that is full of meaning, things we cherish and uphold. \n\n\nThis is how success(and our destiny) can be “every step of the way.”\n\nWe can identify these ways in stories of our past where we were who we wanted to be and where we inspired ourselves. \n\n\nWe can identify stories in others (WWJD), in movies, and in the stories of our friends that uplift us. Where can you find those stories, what’s a story that comes to mind?\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts about what the Good Life is? \nHow do they show up in the words in your mind? \nWhat do you do about them?\nHave they become your habits? \nWould others say it’s your character?\n\n\n\nBeauty Matters\nPoetry is language against\nwhich you have no defenses.\n\n\nbut the fire that burned within them.” —Shannon L. Alder\n21. “Outer beauty attracts, but inner beauty captivates.” —Kate Angell\n22. “To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don’t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.” —Thich Nhat Hanh\n23. “People often say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I say that the most liberating thing about beauty is realizing you are the beholder.” —Salma Hayek\n1. “When you do something noble and beautiful and nobody noticed, do not be sad. For the sun every morning is a beautiful spectacle, and yet most of the audience still sleeps.” —John Lennon\n2. “That’s always seemed so ridiculous to me, that people want to be around someone because they’re pretty. It’s like picking your breakfast cereals based on color instead of taste.” —John Green\n3. “Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart.” —Khalil Gibran\n4. “I think beauty comes from actually knowing who you are. That’s real beauty to me.” —Ellen Degeneres\n5. “I believe it’s time that women truly owned their superpowers and used their beauty and strength to change the world around them.” —Janelle Monae\n6. “People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.” —Elisabeth Kubler-Ross\n7. “Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself.” —Coco Chanel\n8. “Beauty is not caused. It is.” —Emily Dickinson\n9. “Beauty is an attitude.” —Anonymous\n10. “Beauty without grace is the hook without the bait.” —Ralph Waldo Emerson\n11. “Beauty is in the heart of the beholder.” —H. G. Wells\n12. “Beauty is the thing that makes every face unique … and you should never lose that.” —Vera Wang\n13. “Time it seems, gives us all a chance to be really beautiful.” —Anny Curry\nWhy feel everything?\nThe Guest House\n- Jellaludin Rumi-\n\nThis being human is a guest house.\nEvery morning a new arrival.\n\nA joy, a depression, a meanness,\nsome momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.\n\nWelcome and entertain them all!\nEven if they are a crowd of sorrows,\nwho violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, \nstill, treat each guest honorably.\nHe may be clearing you out for some new delight.\n\nThe dark thought, the shame, the malice.\nMeet them at the door laughing and invite them in.\n\nBe grateful for whatever comes.\nbecause each has been sent as a guide from beyond.\n\n-Rumi\n\nReflect on your emotions in this moment, what are they trying to tell you?\nTheir answer: \n\n\nWe accept it all because our emotions are sign points pointing us to what matters to us. Fear of a lion, you value staying alive. \n\nHumor!\n\nWe can find ourselves in situations where competing things on our todo lists matter to us can both matter to us.\n\nEx: I want to play with my niece - there’s a deadline at work. \nThe tension here is an ideal moment to explore values and prioritization, yet often leads to procrastination and negative states.\n\nRecognizing when competing values create resistance and flow patterns helps unlock yourself and become who you want to be.\n\n\nBenefits:\nAuthenticity, \n\nTo paraphrase the philosopher Nietzsche, he who has a strong enough why can bear\nalmost any how. I've found that 20 percent of any change is knowing how; but 80\npercent is knowing why. If we gather a set of strong enough reasons to change, we can change in a minute something we've failed to change for years.\n- Tony Robbins\n\n\nReflect on some of your patterns that get in your way, what feelings come up? \nTheir answer:\n\nDemo Checkin:\nState and Presence\nAfter the initial reflection, gently guide into specific areas:\n“How’s your energy today (1-5)?”\n“What’s present for you—emotionally, mentally, or physically?”\n“What would make today feel complete for you?”\nAlternative: “What’s one thing you’d feel good about having moved forward today?”\n\nSupport Prompt\nAfter identifying the completion anchor:\n“What might help you move this forward?”\n“Is there any support or clarity you need?”\nFollowup Questions\nOptional followup questions leveraging the answers.\nBuilding the context\nShare what you can, the more vulnerable, the more helpful. \nLet me propose a minimalist but powerful session structure based on our work:\nIntake process: 60-Minute Core Facilitation Framework\nOpening (10 min)\nGOAL: Create safety and understand current reality\n\"How are you holding everything right now?\"\n\"What feels most alive or pressing for you today?\"\nStory Gathering (25 min)\nTHREE ESSENTIAL STORIES:\nTension Story\n\"Tell me about something you deeply want to do, but find yourself getting in your way. What happens?\"\nAliveness Story\n\"Share a moment when you felt completely alive and aligned - what made it work?\"\nSupport Story\n\"Tell me about a time when support really helped you move forward. What made it effective?\"\nFOR EACH STORY:\nListen for conditions that enabled/blocked\nNotice energy shifts in telling\nTrack what lights up\nIdentify pattern hints\nPattern Recognition (15 min)\nTogether, look across the stories for:\nCommon conditions that help/hinder\nValue tensions emerging\nSupport patterns that work\nEnergy markers\nIntegration & Next Steps (10 min)\nName key patterns noticed\nIdentify one small next step\nDefine specific support needed\nWhat makes this ideal:\nStarts with the current reality\nUses three crucial story types (tension, aliveness, support)\nAllows natural pattern emergence\nEnds with practical movement\nShort enough to maintain energy\nLong enough for depth\nSimple enough to remember\nRich enough for pattern recognition\n\n\n\nWhat are your first impressions and thoughts?\n\nIntake process:\nHow would it be done with a machine? \nBilal knows her and can guide good questions \n\n"
