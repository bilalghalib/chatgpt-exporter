      "content": "I need to update my solar training, I don't think it's great, here's what I have now and insights from my document: Day 1 – Real Cost & Roof Goals\n\nOpening: Participants review and gather information on home energy struggles and what would improve comfort\n\nHands-on: Find your home on google maps, import roof photo, trace layout and tilt, mark shading, outline needs using PVSol or other software\n\nActivity: Explore hybrid vs. on-grid vs. off-grid vs. water-heater options.\n\nBusiness Component: Start progressive workbook – energy bill baseline + three comfort/cash goals.\n\nNamed Feedback: “What comfort promise would persuade my family?”\n\nDay 2 – Brains & Guts of a System\n\nOpening: Discussion of what’s really inside cheap vs. quality inverters – and what happens when they fail.\n\nHands-on: Inverter tear-down, battery and wire sizing (including for system expansion).\n\nActivity: Crimping & polarity drills; future-proof design with +25 %, +50 % growth.\n\nBusiness Component: Add to workbook – tab for price/warranty comparison and replace-later cost curve.\n\nNamed Feedback: “How do I show the inside of a cheap inverter without opening it?”\n\nDay 3 – Labour, Batteries & Cooling\n\nOpening: How much does a skilled worker cost? What does that mean for fair pricing?\n\nHands-on: Battery placement exercise, foam cool-box demo, temp drop logging.\n\nActivity: Adjust roof plan for shade pergola or other comfort strategies.\n\nBusiness Component: Add labour rate tab + total project cost incl. cooling, labour, and construction extras.\n\nNamed Feedback: “How do I explain fair labour cost to a price-sensitive client?”\n\nDay 4 – Supplier Deals & Service Flow\n\nOpening: What does a “pay-after-install” offer from a supplier really mean?\n\nHands-on: Finalize full BOM (hardware + labour + services).\n\nActivity: Draft monitoring/cleaning contract, calculate recurring income and client payment plan.\n\nBusiness Component: Add service menu, supplier margin notes, and 3-year cash-flow tab.\n\nNamed Feedback: “What keeps a customer loyal after installation?”\n\nDay 5 – Pitch, Build & Fault-Fix\n\nOpening: Learners receive a new client persona + roof photo and are challenged to hit comfort and budget goals.\n\nHands-on: Build mini 4-panel rig; identify & fix 3 hidden faults in sample rigs.\n\nActivity: Pitch full design and pricing plan in under 5 minutes.\n\nBusiness Component: Finalize workbook with profit, margin, and ROI breakdown.\n\nNamed Feedback: “Can I pitch value in plain Iraqi Arabic in under five minutes?”\n\nCanyou take all the insights and make a similar document to the practical thermal management training program - except do it for this solar one? \n\nIt needs to be five days and follow the three part strategy knowledge transfer early, practical hands on / studio/ design, etc/ and then business/ROI calc/customer conversation end of day, except if we need more time to actually do a full build/install\n\nWe want to focus on designing a system that fits for the individuals house\n\nwe want people to know how to pick between hybrid offgrid ongrid systems and which works well for mosul (hybrid if you hhave the money) we want people to be able to know about agricultural options (no batteries needed, can be cheaper and nice! and a great ROI) and large installs, we want people to know they need field experience before they go out into the field. We want an optional sixth day one week later to give them a chance to get \"Certificate plus\" or something like that for when they validated a real life install because the people in mosul i interviewed suggested they'd give them the material up front for free and only pay after the install, they are also the traines, experts and running businesses in solar in mosul so they also said they' dhelp make sure quality control is in place to put the customer at ease that a newbie is doing the install\n\nwhat's this 5 days plus 1 training - give it to me with simple clear tables with clear language for the day by day\n\nHere's the one I made for thermal: [[[# Practical Thermal Management Training Program for Mosul Engineers\n\n## Program Philosophy: \"See It, Feel It, Sell It, Install It\"\n\nThis training focuses on interventions that work TODAY in Mosul - solutions people can see, feel, and afford.

Documentation of Interviews\nThe following table contains the highlights of the interviews and a short summary of the content that was merged into our module. A complete analysis can be found in the annex: \nSession ID\nDate 2025\nParticipants\nCondensed meeting notes – key points raised\nValidated recommendations (already fed into Module 1)\nINT-01\n14 May\nBilal ↔ Hussam Falih – Enterprise-Development Specialist, OXFAM\nIraqi trainees think in amps, not kWh. DC-cable spec & breaker sizing often ignored → fires. Dust neglect is the biggest performance killer; needs a demo. Up-front cost is the main adoption barrier → link to Ministry of Labour loans. Sun-path finder is the best quick shade tool.\nAdd amp-based load worksheet (Day 1). 45-min DC vs AC wiring safety lab (Day 2). Live \"dirty-vs-clean\" watt demo + panel-cleaning SOP (Day 5). Purchase two sun-path finders; embed exercise (Day 4). Invite a micro-loan officer to Day 6 careers panel.\nINT-02\n14 May\nBilal ↔ Muayad Hasan – RENAC Master-Trainer\nUses PVsyst extensively; advocates simulation before field work. Story-based teaching; ends each day with a trainee review circle & anonymous sticky notes. Dust cleaning must avoid midday wash in summer. Poor mounting structures fail in wind; need structural calculations.\n90-min PVsyst demo + 20 trial licences (Day 3). Daily 15-min review circle + sticky-note feedback. Include the dust-clean ROI discussion inside the maintenance block (Day 5). Add structural load worksheet & torque-wrench practical (Day 4).\nINT-03\n16 May\nBilal ↔ Ali Abkan – Technical Support Engineer, Chisage ESS\nCredibility depends on certificates co-signed by major brands (Gisage, Huawei). Proposes \"tear-down & compare\" cheap vs premium inverters to show quality. The market is flooded with fake 10-year warranties. Datasheet literacy and battery–inverter compatibility are critical.\nSecure brand co-logo for certificates. Add 3-inverter tear-down lab (Day 2–3). Myth-busting slide on fake warranties (Day 2). Datasheet scavenger-hunt worksheet (Day 2). Compatibility tables & firmware-pairing demo (Day 3).\nINT-04\n18 May\nBilal ↔ Saud Maan – Lecturer, College of Electrical Engineering & Engineering, Dijla Office\nLearners \"remember by doing\" – keep theory < 20%. Suggests a system-assembly competition judged by employers. Idea: host \"Solar Festival\" linking trainees to 10–15 Mosul companies. Common errors: SPD wiring, DC-polarity swaps, and inverter programming.\nDay 6 installation competition with local firms on the judging panel. Add troubleshooting tasks on SPD, polarity & programming. Plan \"Solar Festival\" showcase two weeks after the course. Negotiate 2-month paid internships with installers.\nINT-05\n18 May\nBilal ↔ Mohammed Al-Qatan – Director, Mosul Solar Co.\nWants Day 1 to start hands-on inverter tear-down; theory woven later (70% lab). Emphasises data sheet reading to stop costly mistakes. String-sizing errors burn fuses; needs calculator exercise. Advocates mock job interviews as an assessment.\nFlip Day 1 agenda: tear down first, then concepts. Insert datasheet reading hunt (Day 1–2). Add string-sizing calculator + fuse-blow demo (Day 3). Schedule mock interviews with three PV firms in the afternoon on Day 6.\nINT-06\n19 May\nBilal ↔ Mustafa Waleed (Mosul Space / Electrical-office partner)\n4-engineer office supplies PV kits, fire & PLC systems. Main clients: large farm pumps (day-only, no battery) and residential users. Biggest failure he sees: batteries thrown in hot, dusty store-rooms; life drops fast. Needs a cool, clean spot, even if cables get longer. Hybrid inverters cost ≈ + US $1,000; commercial pay-back < 2 years; residential 6-8 yrs (dep. on loads). Stresses reading datasheet \"critical rows\" (max PV V, battery V).\nAdd mini-module on battery placement & ventilation; include cable-sizing for remote packs. Put a quick exercise on finding Voc, Vmax, Vbat in an Arabic/English datasheet. Brief comparison case-study: Off-grid vs Hybrid vs On-grid ROI for household vs farm pump.\nINT-07\n20 May\nBilal ↔ Dr Nasih Hma Salah (PhD nanoscience, RENAC Master-Trainer, component supplier)\nUses the Bologna method – always frames sessions & learning goals. Since 2019, has run 30-day TOT courses, 100% job-placement claim for 30 alumni. Recommends 2 days of factory/company visits and homework on market-price collection. Suggest limiting scope to small residential PV (≈150 m² homes) for a 6-day course; skip ag/industrial to stay realistic. Proposes subsidised 2-month internships after course (company gains free helper, trainee gains experience). Highlights ethics: quality standards, \"good niyya\", fix building leaks before adding PV. Notes solar-water-heater intro can be taught in 3 days as a lower-barrier track.\nInsert half-day market-price scavenger task + template; debrief on Day 5 business block. Keep course strictly on small-residential PV; place \"industrial & ag extensions\" in Annex. Add bullet in Section 7 on internship pipeline (link to Saud's pathway idea). Open every day with a 2-min \"session framing\" slide.\n\n\n5. Quantitative Data Points\n5.1 Study of Solar Training Lengths from Interviewed Participants\n1. \"Real-life\" durations the trainers have actually used\n(pulled verbatim from the transcripts – initials in brackets)\n#\nTrainer / Org.\nYear mentioned\nThe typical course pattern they delivered\nHours per contact day\nTotal contact-hours\nTheir slide/delivery preference\n1\nDr Nasih H. – Nanoscience Lab (Baghdad)\n2019\n30 calendar days – 2 h every other day (\"كان أول تدريب… 30 يوم… ساعتين يوم بعد يوم\")\n2 h\n≈ 30 h\nMinimum slides; prefers lab work then PDF hand-outs for self-study\n2\nDr Nasih H. – updated idea\n2025\n7 days straight (\"إلا خ سبع أيام… نجدد سبعة أيام\")\n5 h\n≈ 35 h\nWants Arabic slides + video snippets; no more than 6 bullets per slide\n3\nHussam F. – Oxfam / RENAC ToT\n2023-24\n4 days, 09:00-13:00 (\"أربع أيام هو بالعادة يصير تقريباً من التسعة للوحدة\")\n4 h\n16 h\nPicture-heavy PPT, < 20 slides total; relies on flip-chart teach-backs\n4\nMohammed Q. – Mosul Solar\n2022-24\n6 days full-time (\"ستة أيام… أول شي نبدأ وياهم…\")\n6 h\n≈ 36 h\n\"No theory slides before touching hardware\" – uses photos only\n5\nMuayad H. – RENAC master-trainer\n2024\n3-month online + 14-day hands-on in Germany (RENAC model); Iraqi refreshers are 5-day, 6 h blocks\n6 h\n30 h\n50:50 split – technical schematics + live PVsyst demo; decks capped at 25 slides\n6\nSaud M. – Digital Solar Co.\n2023\nAd-hoc 5 days, 5 h (focus on pumps & hybrid)\n5 h\n25 h\nPrefers interactive Google-Slide deck w/ live datasheet links\n7\nAli A. – Chisage ESS\n2024\nUsually joins other providers' 4- or 5-day courses as brand specialist (2-h battery block)\n—\n—\n8-slide tear-down deck + one live inverter\n\nMedian length across the eight data-points: 5 days (range 4 → 30).\nWhile the range of days is large, the number of contact hours, 30, is similar to our proposed training.\nThe design of the curriculum, post discussion and adaptation, is compared below to available training modules, and to the discussions we’ve had with our stakeholders to determine the appropriateness, the likelihood of their enthusiasm for training the material, and the possibility of being run within a 6-day time frame. We want to thank Mosul Solar and KESK for supporting us with their knowledge and content. \nFrom the interviews and discussions with the trainers, we have identified the following six day training plan to fulfil our requirements: \nCross-Module Bridges (solar ↔ insulation ↔ architecture)\nOn Day 4, students calculate how a white-roof paint job cuts panel temperature by 6 °C, shrinking mismatch losses by ~2 %—a live example of the “energy ecosystem” Dr Nasih championed. Homework asks them to re-size the array if the same house were insulated to 0.4 W/m²K, reinforcing load-reduction parallels for the forthcoming insulation module.\n\n5.2 Trainer Deployment & Class Logistics\nOne master trainer + 2 assistants handle four parallel stations; max 20 trainees as per Muayad’s structure note\nRotation every 90 min keeps all stations busy; assistants run safety checkpoints with a red-tag / green-tag QC drill recommended by Saud.\nGamified recap – a 10-question Kahoot at 15:30 daily satisfies trainer Waleed’s engagement tip \n\n6.
