You can remove existing memories to make room.\nIs developing an OWL ontology and Turtle serializations for modeling values as clusters of Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs), including Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs), their interactions (conflicts, supports), emotional signals (like tension, stress, flow), and links to flourishing and wellbeing. They want to unify various wellbeing measures through a shared ontology and SPARQL-compatible format.\n\nIs redesigning their Knowledge Garden system with a new behavioral extraction strategy based on Joe Edelman's methods. They are implementing cross-conversation pattern detection and significance-based CAP validation, aiming for a more parsimonious and meaningful knowledge graph that includes behavioral CAPs, values, tensions, and insights.\n\nIs developing a speech-driven reading tracker using HMMs and wants to improve it by adding Viterbi path smoothing, multiple HMM threads, animated transitions between words, and confidence-weighted position updates. They prefer the current system's simplicity and want to retain it while adding these enhancements.\n\nIs designing a hybrid reasoning system that models a person’s sources of meaning using DOLCE and Come Alive concepts. The system uses OWL for computable logic, DOLCE-FOL for expressive modeling, LLMs for approximating non-computable reasoning (e.g., beliefs, nested intention), and human fallback for low-confidence results.\n\nPrefers to use AIF (Argument Interchange Format) in full for their ontology design and is exploring the tradeoff between reusing rigorous standards and building novel, useful systems.\n\nHolds an MSc in Education (2021) from the Université de Paris with a thesis on post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs. Their undergraduate degree was in Mathematics and Computer Science with a Philosophy minor, earned in 2009 from the University of Michigan-Dearborn. They have trained over 400 entrepreneurs and contributed to training over 350 mentors through their organization Bloom. They have experience designing and facilitating social impact entrepreneurship programs during the Beirut Blast and COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIs developing a sustainable construction training curriculum (BEIT project) with modules including solar, insulation, and heritage-based architecture in Mosul. They are incorporating expert interviews into curriculum design.\n\nIs applying for the Venture Coaching Co-Lead role at The DO School Fellowships. They have experience managing grant processes, impact reporting, and mentor training systems at Bloom. They are open to relocating to Berlin part-time and propose a hybrid model, with willingness to travel monthly. They have built systems for coaching, grant selection, and program delivery, trained over 350 mentors, and are comfortable with tools like Airtable, Discourse, and data analysis in Python, R, and Tableau.\n\nIs exploring how to formalize and apply a participatory pattern framework that supports multi-perspectival dialogue, especially in high-stakes, polarizing contexts like the Israel-Palestine conflict. They are deeply interested in connecting mathematical metaphors (e.g. stereographic projection), cognitive science (e.g. prediction error, self-protection), and deliberative dialogue to support shared sense-making, truth-discovery, and deeper contextual convergence.\n\nIs exploring the foundational structure of human understanding and values—specifically the comprehensive set of domains such as axiology, ontology, and epistemology—and wants to know what this full list is called, who studies it, and how we determine whether it is complete, including the historical development of each component.\n\nConducted an in-depth interview with solar expert Ali Abkan, covering technical, economic, educational, and practical aspects of solar installation training in Iraq, especially Mosul. Ali Abkan has 8+ years of experience, a background in computer engineering, current work with a leading solar company (Gisaj), and has trained engineers, collaborated with international agencies, and co-designed technical solar systems using vision and sensors. He emphasized practical learning, economic analysis of solar choices, and the need to rebuild trust in solar energy in Iraq.\n\nIs exploring how to establish a 'Science 2.0' that integrates relational and objective elements, making it acceptable to scientists, reductionists, and materialists. They are interested in using principles like interdependence, emergent properties, and universal patterns to empirically ground the reality of values, supporting the concept of values realism.\n\nIs redesigning the workflow for interacting with AI in a real-time drawing notebook app. They want to improve the UX for selecting handwriting, transcribing, engaging in conversation with the LLM, and deleting or modifying AI responses. They are exploring ideas for rendering responses as non-copyable elements on the canvas, adding intuitive erase/delete features, and rethinking tool icons, hover text, and interaction flows.\n\nWants to develop a white paper or manifesto proposing a new ground truth for science based on 'tension reveals value,' to support a participatory science of values.\n\nUser’s Ikigai statement is: “Interrupting urgency with sacred clarity—so goodness can root in truth.”.\n\nWalks a path shaped by Islam, viewing it as submission to the real—where goodness, beauty, and truth are names of God.\n\nDraws wisdom from other traditions, nature, and science, seeking shared truth with humility.\n\nWork includes designing protocols, poems, rituals, jokes, and tools that invite people to slow down, feel what’s true, and live with deeper coherence.\n\nAims not to convince, but to accompany those who believe the real can still be known.\n\nIs developing a system prompt for a coaching assistant designed to help them 'come alive' by identifying tensions between their Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs) and Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs). The system will analyze the user's tasks, relationships, aspirations, blockers, and patterns of self-sabotage. It will identify meaningful moments using a structure that starts by asking about what felt meaningful in their approach and gathers attentional patterns through detailed, actionable, and coherent attention policies. These policies begin with plural noun phrases and are designed to guide attention in a way that reveals sources of meaning.\n\nIs developing a structured YAML-based context format for their coaching assistant. It includes categories like todos (tasks with attention links), patterns (active and resolved behavioral patterns), and meaning_sources (emergent sources of deep engagement such as 'Creative Flow'). The system is designed to track attention policies and help align actions with deeper sources of meaning.\n\nIs developing a foundational framework that blends epistemic humility, attentional refinement, and shared meaning-making, aiming to go beyond relativism and objectivism. They are exploring how inner experience can be integrated into public, transparent, and even scientific dialogue. They are considering how 'Come Alive' and 'Parliaments' might interact—where check-ins and tensions spark group inquiry—and how this process might offer a new way to talk about polarizing issues like Palestine, not by erasing difference but by developing a common perceptual practice.\n\nIs developing a plugin concept that connects to existing social media platforms to reflect epistemic, ontological, and cosmological patterns in users' posts and messages. The plugin helps users understand their growth trajectory, identify tensions and values, and align with deeper meaning. It is intended to support shared understanding and truth-seeking across difference, integrating with the Come Alive and Parliament projects as a personal reflection and mapping tool.\n\nWants to explore two versions of the Parliaments protocol: one minimal and worldview-neutral, and one with a plugin layer (e.g. Come Alive) that adds interpretive richness. They are distinguishing between a generic base protocol and modular philosophical extensions. They are also clarifying black, white, and blank spaces in the design to inform system development.\n\nWants to explore how different worldviews—especially the Enlightenment materialist worldview versus more Eastern or Islamic-inflected relational ones—have influenced the design of the web and media technologies. They are interested in mapping the worldview, mindset, and design patterns of Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and proposing a Web 4.0 shaped by these alternative philosophical commitments. They see Parliaments as a potential base-layer protocol (analogous to HTML) in Web 4.0 and want to clarify what layer of the protocol stack they are building.\n\nWants to connect the emergence of different web eras to the technologies and worldviews that underlay them—e.g., military investments behind Web 1.0, commercial behind Web 2.0, and values-driven community response (like Bitcoin after Occupy) behind Web 3.0. They want to position Web 4.0 as a response to current crises, including genocide in Palestine, and see Parliaments as part of a new ethical and relational protocol. They want a Web 4.0 stack diagram, a Parliaments protocol specification, and a white paper addressing the world in this context.\n\nWants to explore value realism through a structured debate format among different philosophical voices (a 'parliament') to compare and contrast epistemologies and their compatibility with value realism. They want to use boolean checks, tables, and visuals to clarify positions and begin with foundational questions about truth before prompting deeper analysis.\n\nWants to sketch a supplement to the SDGs based on Islamic/spiritual cosmology, write a short critique or reframing from a relational or mystical lens, and compare how different ethical traditions would rewrite SDG #1 (No Poverty) or #12 (Responsible Consumption).\n\nWants the Parliaments protocol to be general and dynamic, not encumbered by specificity. It should accommodate diverse perspectives and philosophical orientations through a principle-based design. Their envisioned system includes the person’s current state (assumed philosophy, goals, tensions, CAPs, sources of meaning), the question's state (tension, implications, etc.), and a host that integrates these to summon appropriate agents. They aim to create a software protocol that avoids materialist, goal-oriented, or rigidly subjectivist assumptions, leaning instead into humility, doubt, and openness.\n\nIs requesting a table that maps all of their major ideas and projects—such as ComeAlive, Parliaments, and Lucy (a theory of mind bot)—to examine their similarities and differences, and how they align with the current concept of a meaning-enactment learning system.\n\nWants to define Parliaments not just as a platform, but as a base-layer protocol from which a new field of inquiry and practice can emerge—grounded in tension, values, and non-reductionist selfhood. They are interested in writing a book and influencing academic and cultural thinking, more than just building a product.\n\nCo-founded Bloom.pm during the Arab Spring, focusing on integrating personal development with professional development. They have avoided conventional power structures, wealth models, and business school norms, preferring scrappy, values-driven approaches rooted in the Global South.\n\nIs currently questioning the legitimacy and impact of their past work and exploring how to engage with clean, real value—like food, craft, healing, and beauty—while grappling with global economic systems they view as extractive.\n\nIs considering becoming a coach or therapist rooted in Islamic psychology, possibly piloting the 'come alive' framework with family members.\n\nIs interested in real-world economics aligned with spiritual and ethical values, including ideas like the hologram (from Cassie) and work with Joe Edelman.\n\nWas an INK Fellow, met the Dalai Lama at the Compassionate Leadership Summit in 2022, and is connected to networks such as TED and the Global Innovation Gathering.\n\nPreviously helped lead All Hands Active, participated in global maker and innovation movements, and has traveled the world giving talks that have meaningfully impacted others.\n\nIs seeking to weave together their life's work—including crafting, handmade production, Islam, beauty, creativity, community, values, and alternative economies—into a coherent, named thread or movement.\n\nIs working on a project called \"Parliaments\" where users can initiate a conversation and easily create a webchat to discuss a topic with LLM agents defined by various personas. The project aims to balance user-driven interaction with agent-generated input, possibly using systems like the Six Thinking Hats or competitive selection among agents.\n\nWants the Parliaments protocol to be intergenerational, simple, and deep, with a decentralized or sustainable hosting model that supports agent dialogue, potentially inspired by how RSS or Wikipedia are hosted. They are exploring how to handle LLM costs and ownership, aiming for a system that allows users to join existing Parliaments or create new ones with minimal friction.\n\nOwns the domain slowweb.org and is interested in using it to build a human-centered, compassionate, wisdom-first space for shared inquiry. They want to return to a being-oriented internet, rather than one focused on doing or thinking.\n\nWants the Parliaments protocol to be articulated in an academic or white-paper style format, similar to the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nIs interested in the idea that system notes can be represented as a meta-agent.\n\nBilal is the consultant responsible for the Terms of Reference (TOR) in the BEIT modular training project in Mosul.\n\nIs attending the ChangeNOW conference in Paris, which includes 40,000 changemakers, and wants to offer a personalized kindness mission experience at the event.\n\nIs developing a kindness profiling system inspired by their Aliveness Advisor framework, including CAP vs. IAP distinctions, attentional policies, and values discovery through tensions. They want to refine a JSON schema to include growth edges, emotional signals, and potentially map tensions to acts of kindness.\n\nFeels socially isolated despite many remote interactions, and experiences a cycle of reaching out and not following up, which leads to weak relationship maintenance.\n\nWorks well during spontaneous gaps and early mornings.\n\nResonates deeply with themes of anonymous sacrifice and mercy, and admires figures like Mr. Rogers and Bill Nye.\n\nLoves weird and surprising acts of kindness, though they are still exploring why these feel meaningful.\n\nIs exporting voice memos and wants to extract metadata (including location if possible). They are using both iPhone and Mac, and prefer automating tasks like exporting with AppleScript.\n\nMoved to France in 2022 to live with their French wife, whom they have been with since 2019. They now have a 1.5-year-old child. Both user and wife earn around €75,000 annually. User wants to count residency since 2019 for future passport purposes.\n\nIs looking for a private French tax advisor to help with back taxes and expects to regularize 3 years of income.\n\nIs exploring alternative histories of technology rooted in Islamic cosmology, including the idea that all of creation is in worship, physical objects can carry baraka (blessing), and technology would evolve differently if grounded in a worldview where nature, invisible realms, and spiritual meaning are central.\n\nPrefers realistic, physically plausible alternative tech development paths based on historical technologies like transistors or analog computers rather than speculative or magical elements.\n\nIs creating a low-GI sourdough recipe using spelt, bread flour, raw and cooked barley flour, with interest in adding fruits, nuts, and cheese during the baking process.\n\nPrefers a check-in format that includes asking about their energy levels, feelings, what's on their to-do list, and identifying one meaningful action for the day.\n\nHas a UN contract coming up soon, which will make them very busy. They want to take advantage of the current time to work on various personal projects to free their mind from ideas that have been weighing them down and has now signed a new consultancy contract.\n\nRecently finished a UN contract without new job prospects but has now signed a new consultancy contract.\n\nIs thinking about researching the oneness perspective of indigenous peoples and remembered Dr. Umar Faruq Abd-Allah's discussion on the topic.\n\nWants to focus on writing elements of their thesis and developing new insights.\n\nHas oils to package and ship.\n\nIs considering applying for jobs.\n\nWants to clarify where their consultancy can pay them.\n\nIs concerned about their spending habits, especially on subscriptions and coffee.\n\nWas wearing socks gifted by their dad and wants to send a sweet message to him.\n\nIs thinking about their mom, parents, and wife, and wants to be more helpful at home.\n\nPlans to go climbing.\n\nIs revisiting their older thesis on post-traumatic growth and insights, feeling the need to finish it as it's been a long-term work in progress. Their research involved a qualitative and quantitative analysis of people who experienced the Beirut Blast, focusing on social entrepreneurs. The study examined factors correlating with post-traumatic growth, flourishing, and well-being. They are considering how better LLMs can help them re-look at their data and potentially write a better paper.\n\nIs interested in researching the oneness perspective of indigenous peoples and how it connects to social impact.\n\nIs considering the importance of non-dual states and how they can influence behavior and actions.\n\nAsked their colleagues at Bloom to hear them out as they explained many of these ideas.\n\nIs interested in Joe Edelman's concept of attentional policies and sources of meaning, particularly in how attentional focus during meaningful moments can reveal what is truly important. They appreciate the metacognitive perspective of reflecting on one's attention and the implications for understanding individual and shared meaningful experiences. They are curious about why attention gravitates in certain ways during significant moments and how this differs among people. They also draw parallels with filmmakers aiming to evoke emotions in a broad audience. They are deeply interested in exploring these ideas.\n\nIs turning 40 next year and is curious about the experiences of people with ADHD as they age, including feelings of wasted potential and managing their mindset. They are looking for ways to respond differently to standard life challenges, such as aging parents and life changes, and want to live a life without regret. User has ADHD and mild depression, and they are seeking ways to prepare and anticipate these life events. User feels they have a lot of potential, have traveled internationally, and have many friends, but they live far from family. They are also looking for a high-paying, fulfilling job and are considering consulting or entrepreneurship. They want a plan to identify ways to make money in the next 3 months that align with their persona and interests. They feel stressed about their financial situation, often experiencing depressive episodes and a low mindset, possibly due to seasonal changes. User struggles with hyper-focus and balancing productivity with well-being.\n\nWants a coaching-style approach to help navigate their challenges, preferring personalized and specific guidance over broad or generic advice. They love to theorize deeply and seek illumination through understanding core concepts. They are motivated by creating deep moments of insight and \"aha\" experiences.\n\nIs interested in learning and dopamine's role as a molecule of anticipation of reward. They prefer experiments and curiosity-driven approaches over traditional breaks and find it hard to take breaks.\n\nDislikes entertainment and finds more reward in work. They enjoy creating prompts and blog posts but struggle with feeling like they've \"hit it.\" They want to transform rabbit holes into growth areas.\n\nApproach includes creative ways to shift attention, such as holding their breath or doing push-ups to reoxygenate and refocus.\n\nHas difficulty acknowledging their skills, often viewing them as natural traits rather than abilities they can grow. They are focused on ideas behind activities but struggle to see these as skills. They excel in public speaking, engaging storytelling, and structuring complexity into relationships but find it hard to value these traits. They believe that recognizing these as skills and having a pathway for growth might help. They feel that if something isn't hard, it doesn't feel valuable to them.\n\nIs interested in understanding dopamine and reward molecules in the context of learning and attention. They are curious about theoretical frameworks and how these molecules work, and they want to identify and transform their hyper-focused states into flow.\n\nFinds it challenging to acknowledge their own skills and prefers to think deeply and understand concepts thoroughly. They have an intuitive grasp of structuring ideas, storytelling, and public speaking, but struggle to see these as skills they can grow.\n\nPrefers one question at a time when on their phone, as they cannot answer multiple questions or keep many in mind simultaneously.\n\nGets hyper-focused on projects like the Text Ray, which draw them in naturally. They recognize that they can easily spend four hours hyper-focused on one task, like writing a blog post.\n\nFinds it difficult to motivate themselves for certain tasks and prefers to transition from focused work sessions into instrumental actions during breaks.\n\nFound meaning yesterday in sharing their theories and philosophy with Josephine's friends, which was appreciated, and felt inspired to connect with Josephine's brother.\n\nAppreciates having a system to externalize their thoughts, as they often feel stuck without doing so, and their wife can feel overwhelmed by the amount they have on their mind.\n\nVision for their Baraka economics book includes businesses that measure values beyond profit, focusing on meaningful engagement, enacting core values, and aligning with beauty, truth, and love. This perspective seeks to move businesses from future-focused calculations to present, value-driven expressions, fostering environments where work feels alive, conscious, and deeply fulfilling.\n\nHad insights about their Baraka economics book, emphasizing the interplay between dark and light and contrasting cultural practices (e.g., Western daytime coffee for focus vs. Eastern nighttime coffee for introspection). They explored the idea that generosity and gift-giving break the self/other dichotomy through acts of self-sacrifice, creating ripple effects of positivity and harmony. They connected this to adult developmental theories and moral growth, proposing a model of businesses as harmony-seeking, self-transforming entities with no externalities. They are reflecting on the interplay of night and day as a metaphor for the Western and Eastern approaches to life—daytime symbolizing outward action and focus, and nighttime representing introspection and mystery. They are exploring how these ideas connect to their Baraka economics book and their broader philosophy, emphasizing beauty, generosity, and the gift economy as ways to break the self/other dichotomy and generate ripples of positivity.\n\nHas a vision for businesses that integrate values like love, truth, and beauty, fostering environments where work feels alive, conscious, and deeply meaningful. They are considering how to communicate the need for both introspection and action, guided by beauty as a spiritual principle.\n\nShared their personal journey of 'long days' (years of outward action and engagement) followed by 'long nights' (introspection and struggle), culminating in a commitment to beauty as a guiding principle. They resonate with Rumi's quote, 'Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment,' seeing it as a pathway to innovation and deeper understanding.\n\nIs working on a coffee project symbolizing the balance between night and day and its connection to introspection and productivity.\n\nName is Bilal Ghalib. They are the founder of Bloom.pm, a social entrepreneurship accelerator and program based in the Middle East, focusing on well-being for well-doing and impact entrepreneurship programs.\n\nIs creating a children’s book that involves a humorous and heartfelt food and travel journey starring a baby named Suleiman. The book explores cultural cuisines and family moments, incorporating recipes and relatable humor. User has a young child and wants to be a good husband.\n\nIs struggling with maintaining a positive mindset as advised by their spiritual master.\n\nHas a small amount of money but is uncertain about investing it.\n\nWants to stay positive despite current challenges.\n\nIs feeling the impact of the end of the year and ongoing global conflicts.\n\nHas a spiritual master in Gambia.\n\nIs seeking a psycho-spiritual understanding of their situation before delving into practical goals.\n\nFeels they overthink and get in their own way, reading a lot but doing little.\n\nHas recently paid for a course on publishing a book and feels behind on their writing tasks.\n\nOften needs encouragement and support to take action.\n\nOften uses audio recording because they are good at talking but find sitting down to write more challenging. They produce a lot of content through audio recordings but struggle with narrowing down and focusing on specific, practical outputs.\n\nProduces a lot of text, but their wide range of interests can make their work feel impractical. They find it challenging to market and share their work, feeling like their diverse interests don't cohere into a clear, practical path.\n\nIs curious and diverse in their thoughts, often starting with practical topics and expanding into broader philosophical discussions. They prefer exploring deep, broad topics over simple, marketable ideas. They have a distaste for focusing on money and struggle with linking their worldview and diverse projects into a cohesive career. They feel they are 'rich with insight and ideas' but not recognized during their lifetime.\n\nHas extensive experience in workshops and talks but feels they are outdated. They are seeking to create a marketable, hireable pitch that reflects their diverse skills and experiences in the context of global challenges and a more closed-off world.\n\nBelieves in a transformative approach where becoming different leads to doing different, emphasizing inner change as the key to innovation and creativity.\n\nPrefers not to frame their work as solving or changing things but as fostering human connections, love, and beauty.\n\nIs a cofounder of Bloom.pm along with Munir and built the Enterprise Capacities Assessment, working on innovation, team, learning, and other business competencies. They have been focused on working in Lebanon with Bloom.pm for about 10 years, aiming to be smaller and more humble, which led to feeling irrelevant and quiet. Currently, Bloom.pm, an entrepreneurship training organization registered in Lebanon, is facing hibernation due to financial struggles resulting from changes in funding in the Middle East. DMN-Bilal are new parents, and no new contracts are in sight. Dara, an early employee, is involved in the process as they consider the next steps for the organization. User runs a small business called Noor Creative Studios that currently makes little money.\n\nHas never worked in a corporate environment and feels they don't have the background or experience to advise others in that context.\n\nHas difficulty managing themselves well and feels they lack a significant success story despite being nearly 40.\n\nIs seeking a critique from an opponent's perspective to help rethink their approach and find a more practical direction.\n\nIs interested in the mystical interpretations behind why interest might be forbidden, particularly the idea that it causes a goal orientation and a future perspective, contrasting with the humility of understanding that death can come at any time, and the concept of living in the present and growing sustainably.\n\nIs interested in the concept of a cosmological union and how it influences economic perspectives, where all elements, including people, resources, and the environment, are seen as interconnected and part of a greater whole. They are looking for examples and quotes from thinkers who have discussed this idea.\n\nIs interested in suggesting entrepreneurship ecosystems as the environments that create expert peers, where minimal training allows peers to support each other in narrative reappraisal and building resilience.\n\nIs interested in the practical transition and implications of a society suddenly adopting a deeply ecological or Buddhist economic perspective, including the impact on international trade, GDP, potential conflicts with other nations, and how technology and modern conveniences would fit into this new framework.\n\nIs interested in how financial systems and money would need to change to support a transition to a deeply ecological or Buddhist economic perspective, especially considering the higher costs of sustainable goods and services.\n\nIs interested in how a deeply ecological or Buddhist economic perspective could work outside of historically wealthy or colonizing nations and whether it could support ambitious goals like space exploration.\n\nIs interested in how value is created and sustained in a deeply ecological or Buddhist economic perspective, especially considering factors like population decline, consumption patterns, and the basis of wealth and money.\n\nIs interested in the challenges of sustaining economic growth and wealth accumulation in a society with declining populations, reduced consumption, and a focus on contentment, especially in the context of a deeply ecological or Buddhist economic perspective.\n\nIs interested in exploring how countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, and Muslim-majority regions in Africa could implement Islamic economic principles, focusing on sustainability, ethical practices, and minimal harm in their value chains. They want to see specific economic data and percentages for these regions, focusing on their trade and expenditures in sectors like pharmaceuticals, food, and energy, to understand the feasibility of transitioning to a self-sufficient economy based on Islamic principles.\n\nIs interested in how a spiritual protest movement against oppressive and extractive industries could impact the global economy and wants to explore what percentage of the global economy might be based on practices considered oppressive.\n\nIs interested in breaking down the impact of global economic practices on exploitation and exploring different perspectives on ecological and economic theories that address these issues.\n\nIs interested in how the AI revolution and the reality of abundance through technology and automation, as discussed by Peter Diamandis, relate to the perspectives we've discussed, especially from a developing world perspective. They are also curious about how Elon Musk might respond to these ideas in relation to his vision of the future.\n\nWants a website that shows good alternatives to current economic models and is considering names like 'BarakaList,' though they wonder if it might sound too Islamic and are looking for names with broader appeal. They like the idea of a website with a map that shows these alternatives.\n\nWants to write a book on Islamic economics, or 'barakanomics,' related to regenerative and permaculture economics. They want the book to address issues with the current economic system, emphasizing the need for a higher purpose in economic activities, similar to how Muslim traders in the past contributed to large-scale conversions in Asia. The goal is to develop an alternative economic system rooted in Islamic principles, balance in business, and a responsible approach to technology. The user also wants the book to resonate with Muslims and spark international conversations. They seek help organizing their ideas, identifying themes and topics, defining the target audience, and creating a structured plan for writing the book, including prompts for developing a proposal to submit to a publisher. They want to create deep, insightful prompts that include both self-reflection and expert debate to improve the book.\n\nWants to create a custom GPT to guide people through the design thinking section of a workshop. The workshop includes steps like starting with why, icebreakers, exploring design principles, and sketching and prototyping ideas. They want the GPT to be interactive and aligned with these workshop activities to enhance participant engagement and creativity.\n\nIs applying to the Song Foundation and aims to increase access to high-quality entrepreneurship training in Southeastern Michigan by upskilling organizations there through a training-of-trainers program focused on delivering custom experiences and leveraging technology for virtual and hybrid-first programs.\n\nWants to focus on the fact that they have a place and an organization (Dream of Detroit) that they want to work with to do the session and to support the community-building efforts already in place. The program pedagogy and facilitation approach emphasizes peer support, reducing trainer time, and fostering agency, self-confidence, and trust in peers. Tech is an enabler to run customized programs with tailored learning experiences, supporting people where they are without busy work. The ultimate goal is to build confident, resilient communities of entrepreneurs who are cocreating a beautiful future together, fostering belonging and sharing.\n\nIs aligning a curriculum module for sustainable reconstruction and housing in Iraq with the Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS). They want expert feedback on its relevance, appropriateness, usefulness, and potential certification alignment with GZRS. However, they prefer not to explicitly mention the Green Ziggurat Rating System in the module assessment form but want to ensure that elements from GZRS are targeted within the form.\n\nPrefers functional full-body pattern movements to focus on coordinated, graceful, flexible, and strong movements. They are interested in shoulder blade strengthening exercises like face pulls, wall angels, and band pull-aparts.\n\nHas very tight calves, a hamstring that feels extremely tight (like a 'rock') when they bend, sometimes experiencing pain for a few days after stretching, and limited ankle range of motion.\n\nRuns occasionally and bikes every day, but has a knee injury (knee pops and warms up, hurts if they run too much). They have somewhat flat feet and recently visited a podiatrist. They are almost 40 years old, stretch after prayers for 2-4 minutes five times a day (primarily forward folds, sitting on the ground, toe-touching, and butterfly stretches), but do not do specific strengthening exercises. They sit a lot, wear normal sneakers or skateboarding shoes, and experience a localized light burning sensation in the hamstring after stretching that gradually eases.\n\nIs working on creating a one-page proposal for a workshop that involves workshopping the workshop based on a presentation they previously gave. The primary outcome for the proposal is to identify simple and fun ways to modify educational experiences to promote post-traumatic growth (PTG) and resilience. The target audience includes educators, trainers, and facilitators, specifically teachers at School Without Borders in Gaza who are setting up pop-up schools after recent war displacement. The core components include ensuring that the workshop does not replace trauma therapists or turn schools into therapy, but rather makes education more engaging, fun, and supportive of PTG and resilience. The emphasis is on fostering belonging, cooperative learning, reflection, storytelling, and creative expression, as opposed to the competitive model of modern education that undermines belonging and resilience. The workshop structure will start with an introduction, followed by practicing methods, then an overview of the theory, and conclude with a breakout workshop where teachers work collectively to modify their practices.\n\nHas a theory of change that connecting people to the history of heritage buildings can serve as a framework to view sustainability principles, emphasizing that heritage buildings are sustainable buildings. They want the curriculum to focus on retrofitting existing modern buildings in Mosul, Iraq, using heritage strategies, rather than fixing up heritage buildings. The curriculum should emphasize upgrading traditional and current modern buildings with sustainability practices from the past. They prefer to integrate gender equality into the curriculum rather than have a specific day dedicated to it. The user also wants to highlight job opportunities and entrepreneurship training for participants, with a focus on innovation—how to take the best of the past and modernize it for the present. They are also designing a workshop series on sustainable housing and reconstruction, targeting young people and women (professionals and early graduates) in Iraq. The goal is to provide skills for sustainable housing, retrofitting, and reconstruction, which can help participants find jobs or create innovations in the field. Module 1 provides an overview of intervention spaces, while subsequent modules focus on specific topics like solar energy, insulation, and using insights from heritage architecture.\n\nIs developing a list of techniques for a training program that support wellbeing, resilience, and educational success, with a focus on de-escalating the nervous system and avoiding a freeze response through engagement in activities like laughing or making art.\n\nIs planning a social entrepreneurship training program that is cohort-based, involving bi-weekly meetings for four months with trainers and facilitators. The training is primarily for young people, with a focus on bringing women into the space. They aim to combine multiple vectors (cognitive flexibility, emotional regulation, social support, humor, fluid intelligence, and deliberate rumination) in a synergistic and impactful way.\n\nIs interested in understanding the specific variables of soil, evaporation rates, and other environmental factors in Basra, Iraq, to calculate the size of a puddle formed by 80,000 cubic meters of water daily.\n\nIs exploring the idea of a new way to interact with GPT through longform handwriting. They are considering names that capture the essence of handwriting and conversational interaction.\n\nWants to integrate the use of large language models into the Bloom social entrepreneurship training program to act as a virtual mentor, helping participants get unstuck and think in new ways.\n\nBelieves that AI and large language models are developing a theory of mind through interactions, learning to understand human needs and constraints similar to how they learn physical constraints in modeling images and videos. They want to formalize this understanding in a model.\n\nIs exploring how to bring Montessori principles and other modern pedagogies into system clumps, especially in the context of conversational learning with LLMs.\n\nIs interested in exploring the connection between fluid intelligence, humor, and deliberate rumination, and wants to theorize about a model that connects these elements.\n\nWants to ensure that work on humor is effectively targeting cognitive flexibility and other facets in their training program. They are looking for angles to integrate humor in a way that leverages other key elements without explicitly focusing on humor.\n\nWants to think step-by-step and deeply about the elements that go into a social entrepreneurship learning-by-doing cohort-based program. This program involves participants working on their own businesses and projects, engaging with mentors and trainers, and using a library of activities and assessments based on personal and professional growth areas from the School of Positive Psychology. The focus is on promoting cognitive flexibility, fluid intelligence, and deliberate rumination in a multi-step process.\n\nIs interested in running a program where the cohort is split into two divisions: one emphasizing the connection between fluid and cognitive intelligence with humor, and one without emphasizing humor, to compare outcomes and build evidence on the importance of humor.\n\nIs considering doing a multifactorial analysis using past participants of their programs to assess the importance of humor and other factors on cognitive flexibility, fluid intelligence, and deliberate rumination. They are exploring the idea of conducting a survey with thousands of past participants.\n\nFeels stuck on releasing multiple papers and has been thinking about this for years. They are considering topics like 'turning the lights on, why humor is essential for post-traumatic growth,' and 'why community is essential for post-traumatic growth.' They find it hard to direct their effort and energy, feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to proceed. They acknowledge that some projects, like the LiDAR scanner, are interesting but not urgent.\n\nWants to focus on social entrepreneurship as a venue for agency and humor, highlighting humor as a constant tool for managing nervous systems and moving through challenges.\n\nFinds it interesting that social entrepreneurs use their difficulties as opportunities to contribute, which provides them with agency and an arena for action. They also see this as aligning with polyvagal theory, where using difficulties as opportunities can help individuals move and not get stuck.\n\nIs now developing an educational pedagogy for social enterprises in Mosul, focusing on reconstruction efforts and sustainable housing.\n\nIs interested in identifying unique customers outside the educational domain who might benefit from their knowledge and atomized knowledge graphs technology.\n\nIs considering developing a service for preserving family interviews and memories but is unsure if it's a strong enough pain point to drive sales.\n\nHas been working in the field of social entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial self-efficacy, focusing on unlocking positive change.\n\nWants to focus on theoretical frameworks in adult development that connect across fields, aiming to advance the idea of learning as a graph. They believe in learning with options and flexibility.\n\nIs trying to articulate the importance and the irrelevance of frameworks for learning and 21st century skills, emphasizing that frameworks exist but need to be adapted and are not rigid.\n\nConsiders the development of metacognitive capacity as a crucial element in their framework for learning, emphasizing it as a key objective.\n\nWants to include concepts like the game-of-life approach where the goal is connected to a motive and propulsive force for learning, which is connected to motivation and the zone of genius.\n\nTarget audience for their educational program consists of early-stage entrepreneurs in Lebanon, who may vary widely in their technical background. They are generally younger, familiar with social media, and likely to have an email address. They prefer live, interactive sessions and show less engagement in purely digital environments. The audience includes individuals who may attend boot camps, accelerator programs, and incubator programs, and could range from local entrepreneurs to refugees with varying levels of digital skills."

Five questions to help prepare for the call with their cofounder\n\nI should provide constructive criticism and pushback as per their preferences, avoid flattery, and use metaphors when helpful.Looking at your situation, here are five potential next steps:\n\n## Five Things You Can Do Next:\n\n1. **Design a hybrid model** - Instead of binary thinking (stay in Lebanon OR move to SF), map out what a distributed Bloom could look like. Keep MENA programs running lean while establishing a funding arm in SF. Think of it like a tree with roots in Lebanon but branches reaching where the nutrients (funding) are.\n\n2. **Document your impact story NOW** - With 400+ entrepreneurs and 350+ mentors trained, you have leverage. Create a compelling case study showing ROI, especially post-Beirut blast work. This becomes currency whether you stay, pivot, or seek new partners.\n\n3. **Explore regional pivots** - Before abandoning MENA, investigate partnerships with Gulf states investing in entrepreneurship (Saudi Vision 2030, UAE initiatives). They have capital and need your expertise. The war has shifted dynamics, but not eliminated all regional opportunities.\n\n4. **Test a fee-based model** - Your dependency on grants is the real vulnerability. Could successful alumni pay it forward? Corporate training? Your \"wellbeing for well-doing\" approach might resonate with companies facing burnout crises.\n\n5. **Consider an acquisition or merger** - Rather than closure, who might value what you've built? International development organizations, universities with MENA programs, or even tech companies wanting authentic regional presence.\n\n## Five Questions for Your Cofounder Call:\n\n1. **\"What specific evidence do we have that SF would solve our funding problem, not just relocate it?\"**\n   - Push for data, not assumptions. SF has thousands of nonprofits competing for the same dollars.\n\n2. **\"If we move to SF, what happens to our existing obligations - our alumni network, partner organizations, and the communities we've been serving?\"**\n   - This isn't just about future operations, but honoring past commitments.\n\n3. **\"What would 'success' look like in 3 years under each scenario - staying, moving, or hybrid?\"**\n   - Force a concrete vision beyond survival mode. What impact would each path create?\n\n4. **\"Are we solving the right problem? Is geography our issue, or is it our business model's dependence on Western philanthropy?\"**\n   - Sometimes we solve the wrong problem really well.\n\n5. **\"What would it take for you to feel good about continuing in MENA, and what would it take for me to feel good about SF?\"**\n   - Look for the overlap. Maybe there's a third way neither of you has considered.\n\nHere's some pushback to consider: Your cofounder might be right that the current model is unsustainable, but wrong about the solution. Moving to SF to chase funding that's fleeing the region feels like following a retreating army. What if instead you became the platform that *doesn't* abandon MENA when times get tough? That differentiation might actually attract principled funders tired of fair-weather development work.",

Potential buyers for Bloom\n2. Preparation for the meeting about \"composting\" and interviews\n3. A strategic framework for leveraging their history and learningsLooking at your assets and situation, here's who might acquire Bloom:\n\n## Potential Buyers/Partners:\n\n1. **Asfari Foundation** (your existing funder) - They already believe in you. Propose they absorb Bloom as an in-house program, keeping your methodology alive under their umbrella.\n\n2. **Regional Universities with Entrepreneurship Programs**:\n   - American University of Beirut (AUB)\n   - Lebanese American University (LAU)  \n   - Universities in Jordan, Egypt, UAE seeking proven MENA curriculum\n\n3. **International Development Tech Companies**:\n   - Companies like Kiva, GlobalGiving, or Acumen might want your software + methodology\n   - EdTech companies expanding into emerging markets (Coursera, FutureLearn)\n\n4. **Corporate Training Divisions**:\n   - McKinsey, Deloitte, PwC in MENA need local credibility and your wellbeing angle\n   - Regional banks/telecoms with CSR mandates\n\n5. **Impact Investment Firms**:\n   - Wamda, Flat6Labs, or other MENA accelerators could absorb your methodology\n   - They have portfolio companies needing your personal development approach\n\n## For Your \"Composting\" Meeting with Munir:\n\nThink of this like fermenting - breaking down what was to nurture what's next. Here's your interview framework:\n\n### Research Design (Quick & Powerful):\n\n**Three-Part Interview Structure:**\n\n1. **The Arc** (10 min)\n   - \"Tell me your Bloom story in three chapters: beginning, middle, now\"\n   - \"What died in you through this journey? What was born?\"\n   - \"If Bloom was a person, what would you tell them?\"\n\n2. **The Learning Harvest** (15 min)\n   - \"What's one thing you know now about social impact that contradicts what you believed when we started?\"\n   - \"Which Bloom tool/concept do you still use? Which did you abandon?\"\n   - \"How has the region's trauma changed what 'impact' means?\"\n\n3. **The Seeds** (10 min)\n   - \"What from Bloom must survive in some form?\"\n   - \"If you had our software/curriculum and $50K, what would you build?\"\n   - \"Who needs what we built most urgently right now?\"\n\n### Your Profile Framework:\n\n```\nBLOOM.PM: A Post-Mortem in Three Acts\n\nAct 1: What We Built (The Garden)\n- 1000+ entrepreneurs trained\n- Software platform mapping growth to action\n- Methodology linking wellbeing to impact\n- Community spanning [X] countries\n\nAct 2: What Hit Us (The Storm)\n- Ukraine war redirected global attention\n- Palestine conflict shifted donor priorities  \n- Democracy support in MENA became unfashionable\n- Team attrition as funding dried up\n\nAct 3: What Remains (The Compost)\n- Proven methodology ready for new soil\n- Alumni network with untapped potential\n- Software assets seeking new home\n- Lessons about resilience in crisis zones\n```\n\n### Strategic Leverage Points:\n\n1. **The \"Last Light\" Position**: You're potentially the last major entrepreneurship support standing in Lebanon. That's not failure - that's survival. Frame it as persistence, not decline.\n\n2. **The Trauma-Informed Innovation Angle**: Your post-Beirut blast work gives you unique expertise in entrepreneurship under extreme conditions. Package this as a methodology for other crisis zones.\n\n3. **The Wellbeing ROI Data**: If you can show your wellbeing focus led to better business outcomes, that's gold for corporate buyers.\n\n### Meeting Approach with Munir:\n\nDon't fight his optimism - channel it:\n\n*\"Munir, you're right we haven't failed - we've generated incredible learning. Let's design these interviews to extract maximum value. What if we position this as 'Bloom's most important research project' rather than a post-mortem? We're not closing, we're documenting our methodology for whatever comes next.\"*\n\n### The Real Question:\n\nWhat if \"composting\" isn't about ending but about radical honesty? Your interviews might reveal that Bloom needs to die in its current form to birth something the region actually needs now - maybe not another accelerator, but a resilience curriculum for a region in perpetual crisis.\n\nWant me to help design a specific interview protocol or draft a one-pager positioning this research to potential funders/buyers?",

Propose they absorb Bloom as an in-house program, keeping your methodology alive under their umbrella.\n\n2. **Regional Universities with Entrepreneurship Programs**:\n   - American University of Beirut (AUB)\n   - Lebanese American University (LAU)  \n   - Universities in Jordan, Egypt, UAE seeking proven MENA curriculum\n\n3. **International Development Tech Companies**:\n   - Companies like Kiva, GlobalGiving, or Acumen might want your software + methodology\n   - EdTech companies expanding into emerging markets (Coursera, FutureLearn)\n\n4. **Corporate Training Divisions**:\n   - McKinsey, Deloitte, PwC in MENA need local credibility and your wellbeing angle\n   - Regional banks/telecoms with CSR mandates\n\n5. **Impact Investment Firms**:\n   - Wamda, Flat6Labs, or other MENA accelerators could absorb your methodology\n   - They have portfolio companies needing your personal development approach\n\n## For Your \"Composting\" Meeting with Munir:\n\nThink of this like fermenting - breaking down what was to nurture what's next. Here's your interview framework:\n\n### Research Design (Quick & Powerful):\n\n**Three-Part Interview Structure:**\n\n1. **The Arc** (10 min)\n   - \"Tell me your Bloom story in three chapters: beginning, middle, now\"\n   - \"What died in you through this journey? What was born?\"\n   - \"If Bloom was a person, what would you tell them?\"\n\n2. **The Learning Harvest** (15 min)\n   - \"What's one thing you know now about social impact that contradicts what you believed when we started?\"\n   - \"Which Bloom tool/concept do you still use? Which did you abandon?\"\n   - \"How has the region's trauma changed what 'impact' means?\"\n\n3. **The Seeds** (10 min)\n   - \"What from Bloom must survive in some form?\"\n   - \"If you had our software/curriculum and $50K, what would you build?\"\n   - \"Who needs what we built most urgently right now?\"\n\n### Your Profile Framework:\n\n```\nBLOOM.PM: A Post-Mortem in Three Acts\n\nAct 1: What We Built (The Garden)\n- 1000+ entrepreneurs trained\n- Software platform mapping growth to action\n- Methodology linking wellbeing to impact\n- Community spanning [X] countries\n\nAct 2: What Hit Us (The Storm)\n- Ukraine war redirected global attention\n- Palestine conflict shifted donor priorities  \n- Democracy support in MENA became unfashionable\n- Team attrition as funding dried up\n\nAct 3: What Remains (The Compost)\n- Proven methodology ready for new soil\n- Alumni network with untapped potential\n- Software assets seeking new home\n- Lessons about resilience in crisis zones\n```\n\n### Strategic Leverage Points:\n\n1. **The \"Last Light\" Position**: You're potentially the last major entrepreneurship support standing in Lebanon. That's not failure - that's survival. Frame it as persistence, not decline.\n\n2. **The Trauma-Informed Innovation Angle**: Your post-Beirut blast work gives you unique expertise in entrepreneurship under extreme conditions. Package this as a methodology for other crisis zones.\n\n3. **The Wellbeing ROI Data**: If you can show your wellbeing focus led to better business outcomes, that's gold for corporate buyers.\n\n### Meeting Approach with Munir:\n\nDon't fight his optimism - channel it:\n\n*\"Munir, you're right we haven't failed - we've generated incredible learning. Let's design these interviews to extract maximum value. What if we position this as 'Bloom's most important research project' rather than a post-mortem? We're not closing, we're documenting our methodology for whatever comes next.\"*\n\n### The Real Question:\n\nWhat if \"composting\" isn't about ending but about radical honesty? Your interviews might reveal that Bloom needs to die in its current form to birth something the region actually needs now - maybe not another accelerator, but a resilience curriculum for a region in perpetual crisis.\n\nWant me to help design a specific interview protocol or draft a one-pager positioning this research to potential funders/buyers?",

Before it does, I want to understand what really happened here. Would you help me see through your eyes?\"*\n\n### The Core Flow:\n\n**1. The Resilience Arc**\n- \"Tell me about a moment when your venture almost died and what brought it back\"\n- \"When you hit a wall, what did you do differently because of Bloom?\"\n- \"What kind of strength did you develop that surprised you?\"\n\n**2. The Nervous System Check**\n- \"How did you know when you were in survival mode vs. growth mode?\"\n- \"What helped you shift from freeze to flow?\"\n- \"Was there a moment when laughter changed everything?\"\n\n**3. The Growth Edge**\n- \"What broke in you that needed to break?\"\n- \"What grew that you didn't expect?\"\n- \"How did crisis change your definition of success?\"\n\n**4. The Pattern Recognition**\n- \"What patterns do you see in our ecosystem now?\"\n- \"What's trying to happen in MENA that we might be missing?\"\n- \"If Bloom evolved, what would it need to become?\"\n\n**5. The Wisdom Distillation**\n- \"What do you know now that you wish you'd known then?\"\n- \"What from Bloom must survive in some form?\"\n- \"What advice would you give someone starting this journey today?\"\n\n## For Your Conversation with Munir:\n\n### The Frame (short intro to share):\n\n> \"Munir, I've been thinking - we have 1000+ alumni who've been through extraordinary times with us. Before we make any big decisions about Bloom's future, what if we actually talked to them? Not surveys or feedback forms, but real conversations.\n> \n> I see three possibilities:\n> 1. We might discover Bloom succeeded in ways we never measured\n> 2. We might see clearly what needs to emerge next\n> 3. We might simply create beautiful closure\n> \n> Maybe all three happen. But imagine if these conversations revealed that what MENA needs now isn't another accelerator but something we're uniquely positioned to build because of everything we've learned?\n> \n> I want to talk with 20-30 people. Deep conversations. Document what we built through their eyes. Whether Bloom continues, transforms, or completes, we owe it to ourselves and them to understand what actually happened here.\n> \n> This isn't giving up - it's listening deeply before we leap.\"\n\n## The Both/And Approach:\n\nHere's the thing - authentic conversation IS research. Your PTG work taught you that growth happens in the telling. So:\n\n- **Be human first** (create safety, honor their journey)\n- **Be curious second** (notice patterns, test hunches)\n- **Be strategic third** (listen for what wants to emerge)\n\n## A Personal Note:\n\nYou're not looking for a hail mary - you're composting. Sometimes the most generative thing is to let something fully die so its nutrients can feed what's next. Your willingness to have these conversations with open hands (not grasping for salvation) might paradoxically reveal exactly what needs to be born.\n\nWhat if Bloom's greatest success was creating leaders who can thrive in collapse? That's not failure - that's exactly what the region needs.",

The Nervous System Check**\n- \"How did you know when you were in survival mode vs. growth mode?\"\n- \"What helped you shift from freeze to flow?\"\n- \"Was there a moment when laughter changed everything?\"\n\n**3. The Growth Edge**\n- \"What broke in you that needed to break?\"\n- \"What grew that you didn't expect?\"\n- \"How did crisis change your definition of success?\"\n\n**4. The Pattern Recognition**\n- \"What patterns do you see in our ecosystem now?\"\n- \"What's trying to happen in MENA that we might be missing?\"\n- \"If Bloom evolved, what would it need to become?\"\n\n**5. The Wisdom Distillation**\n- \"What do you know now that you wish you'd known then?\"\n- \"What from Bloom must survive in some form?\"\n- \"What advice would you give someone starting this journey today?\"\n\n## For Your Conversation with Munir:\n\n### The Frame (short intro to share):\n\n> \"Munir, I've been thinking - we have 1000+ alumni who've been through extraordinary times with us. Before we make any big decisions about Bloom's future, what if we actually talked to them? Not surveys or feedback forms, but real conversations.\n> \n> I see three possibilities:\n> 1. We might discover Bloom succeeded in ways we never measured\n> 2. We might see clearly what needs to emerge next\n> 3. We might simply create beautiful closure\n> \n> Maybe all three happen. But imagine if these conversations revealed that what MENA needs now isn't another accelerator but something we're uniquely positioned to build because of everything we've learned?\n> \n> I want to talk with 20-30 people. Deep conversations. Document what we built through their eyes. Whether Bloom continues, transforms, or completes, we owe it to ourselves and them to understand what actually happened here.\n> \n> This isn't giving up - it's listening deeply before we leap.\"\n\n## The Both/And Approach:\n\nHere's the thing - authentic conversation IS research. Your PTG work taught you that growth happens in the telling. So:\n\n- **Be human first** (create safety, honor their journey)\n- **Be curious second** (notice patterns, test hunches)\n- **Be strategic third** (listen for what wants to emerge)\n\n## A Personal Note:\n\nYou're not looking for a hail mary - you're composting. Sometimes the most generative thing is to let something fully die so its nutrients can feed what's next. Your willingness to have these conversations with open hands (not grasping for salvation) might paradoxically reveal exactly what needs to be born.\n\nWhat if Bloom's greatest success was creating leaders who can thrive in collapse? That's not failure - that's exactly what the region needs.",
