Is it:\n\n- The **stillness and warmth** that fills the space around you and the other person?  \n- The **intimacy and trust** that feels almost sacred, like nothing else needs to exist in that moment?  \n- The sense of **connection to something larger**, like this overflowing pool of love, timeless and infinite?  \n\nWhat else feels like part of the experience?

It’s less about action and more about soaking in that moment of togetherness, feeling the warmth and light of love radiate between you.\n\nLet me try to sketch out what you pay attention to in these moments:\n\n1. **LOVE that arises naturally** in moments of connection, without needing effort or expectation.  \n2. **STILLNESS in the presence** of another, allowing for hearts to open.  \n3. **INTIMACY that feels timeless**, like you’re both sharing something deeply sacred.  \n4. **TOGETHERNESS that’s simple and profound**, like basking in the same light of love.  \n\nHow does that feel to you?
