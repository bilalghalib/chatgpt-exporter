And through that we\nfind as we work hardest to be in support of beauty, we will become\nbeautifully supported. \\\n\\\nSelf knowledge\\\nAlso external knowledge\\\nAlso competence is so important you have to be able to KNOW and also\nhave the skills to do\\\n\\\nAnd self knowledge is important because then you know who you are, what\nyou can/cannot do and to be like th eporphet said one human body\\\nWhere each piece has it's role and responsibility\\\nYet it all operates cohesively and harmoniously \\\nWhere if any one part was greedy for resources, we'd call that a cancer\nand we'd have to remove it.\\\n\\\n**TLDR: A transforming world needs transforming people. **\\\n\\\nTo help people transform is working on the only thing anyone really has\nactual control of, inner states and how we respond. We can support inner\nstates with coffee, or meditation, or good community or dancing - these\nstates can become permanent with enough practice. The state is the place\nfrom which we have the ability to choose how to respond. Thus one of the\nfew places we are given free will is in a moment of clarity to choose to\nfind a friend group that takes you dancing, or to start a tiny habit\nwhich can grow into a meditation practice, etc. By choosing the states\nwhich give access to reason, we can enable the noble parts of our\ncharacter to be that which responds.\\\n\\\nWe cannot actually \"just stop oil\" - we can build the movement, the\ncommunity, the states which lead to heads of oil companies to decide\ndifferently, for people to choose to bike. We should not measure biking,\nwe should be measuring that which leads to biking and then secondarily\nlook into the biking. \\\n\\\nThe reason for this is because if we look at what we expect goodness to\nbe, we will miss the thousand things that are good that we didn't think.\nAlso, by measuring it and asking people to bike vs getting them into a\nplace where free will has leverage (good state, good knowledge) then we\nwill see something beautiful. This is what I mean by surprise and why I\nlike surprise. \\\n\\\nIt's related to humility. A humility that comes from the realization of\na truth that was hard won - I have no idea what good looks like. I know\nbad, for sure and that things must change, yet how Good will come about,\nwhat it could be instead of what I think it is, wow! How cool is it to\nhave a life like this. This fits in beautifully with our pedagogy. \\\n\\\nSurprise me, think for yourself and show me what I couldn't have thought\nof myself because you are there, you are touching the issue. \\\n\\\nGood knowledge does include knowledge of how others have solved the\nproblem. It does include skills for sure, or at least knowing what\nskills are needed and bringing people into the team if they don't have\nit. So education and having frameworks and community building is all\nessential. Yet it should not distract ourselves from the fundamental\nissue of transformation of individuals in empowering communities. \\\n\\\nThese communities can become communities of outward and inward\nsupport. \\\n\\\nMaybe the one measure during the program can be, how many people do you\ntruly love in this cohort? \\\n\\\nAfter the program: how many people do you still love and stay in touch\nwith. \\\n\\\nLove will create collaboration. Love is behind the care to ask the\nquestion of how can I help. Love will make the space for vulnerability\nwhere someone can say: I'm stuck and I don't believe in my project\nanymore. \\\n\\\nAnd for me, this is the most beautiful thing we can do. So I guess\nbeauty and surprise (which references awe) are my higher values. The\nsense of beauty I get when I see people who love each other use their\nlives to create beautiful things for others. The equation can be\\\n\\\nLove + Service = Beauty\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nThis document has the content for the prior frameworks and has a long\ndiscussion between Bilal (me) and claude.ai - an LLM to attempt to find\nthe meta principles and a cleaner more aligned framework. It has a lot\nof thinking and is not perfect. Focus on the end where we align all the\nframeworks and let's read between the prompts read between the lines to\nidentify fundamental goals\\\n\\\nNAVIGATE as a result of digesting PDAC, SCRIBER and INSPIRE.

Personalized learning paths: By analyzing a learner\\'s knowledge\n    volume and vector space, you can create customized learning paths\n    that target their specific gaps and interests, optimizing their\n    learning journey.\n\n2.  Analogical reasoning: As you mentioned, embeddings enable analogical\n    reasoning by allowing you to find similar concepts across different\n    domains. This can help learners develop critical thinking skills and\n    understand complex ideas through relatable examples.\n\n3.  Knowledge exploration: Embeddings create a virtual \\\"library\\\" where\n    learners can browse related concepts, discovering new ideas and\n    connections they may not have encountered otherwise. This\n    serendipitous discovery process can spark curiosity and deepen\n    understanding.\n\n4.  Adaptive assessment: By tracking changes in a learner\\'s knowledge\n    volume and vector space over time, you can create adaptive\n    assessments that dynamically adjust difficulty and focus based on\n    their progress and mastery of specific concepts.\n\n5.  Concept mapping: Embeddings can be used to generate visual concept\n    maps that illustrate the relationships between ideas, helping\n    learners grasp the big picture and navigate complex subject matter\n    more easily.\n\n6.  Collaborative learning: By comparing the vector spaces of multiple\n    learners, you can identify areas of overlap and complementary\n    knowledge, fostering collaborative learning experiences and\n    knowledge sharing.\n\n7.  Intelligent tutoring: Embeddings can power intelligent tutoring\n    systems that provide targeted explanations, examples, and feedback\n    based on a learner\\'s specific misunderstandings or gaps in\n    knowledge.\n\n8.  Metacognitive skill development: By visualizing their own knowledge\n    growth and vector space trajectories, learners can develop\n    metacognitive skills such as self-reflection, goal-setting, and\n    self-regulation.\n\n9.  Cross-disciplinary exploration: Embeddings can reveal surprising\n    connections between seemingly unrelated subjects, encouraging\n    learners to explore cross-disciplinary ideas and develop a more\n    holistic understanding of the world.\n\n10. Multilingual learning: By aligning vector spaces across different\n    languages, embeddings can facilitate multilingual learning\n    experiences, allowing learners to seamlessly navigate between\n    resources and concepts in various languages.\\\n    Top 5 most useful embedding applications for learning:\n\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n| 1.             | **Principle**  | **How it       | **Example      |\n|   Personalized |                | Leverages      | Prompt**       |\n|     learning   |                | Embeddings**   |                |\n|     paths      |                |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n| 2.

What is your primary goal for using embeddings in learning? Is it\n    personalization, identifying knowledge gaps, fostering\n    cross-disciplinary insights, or providing immersive learning\n    experiences?\n\n2.  How important is alignment with pedagogical concepts to you? Do you\n    prefer a framework that strongly aligns with established learning\n    theories, or are you open to more experimental approaches?\n\n3.  What level of complexity are you comfortable with in terms of\n    embedding-based learning? Do you prefer a more straightforward\n    approach or one that involves advanced techniques like scenario\n    simulation and role-playing?\n\n4.  How do you plan to measure the success of the embedding-based\n    learning framework? Will you focus on learner engagement, knowledge\n    acquisition, skill development, or a combination of these factors?\n\n5.  Do you have any specific constraints or requirements, such as the\n    need for real-time adaptability, scalability, or integration with\n    existing learning platforms?\\\n    Based on your answers to these questions, I can help refine the\n    frameworks and suggest the one that best aligns with your needs and\n    priorities. By leveraging the power of embeddings in a way that\n    resonates with your goals and constraints, we can create a highly\n    effective and engaging learning experience that drives meaningful\n    results.\\\n    Copy\\\n    **BG**\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  i believe that it\\'s now possible to self mentor because embeddings\n    are like dewey/loc and you can find things oyu wouldln\\'t otherwise,\n    you can use conversation style to help dialog which helps people\n    think, and since socratic method works you can leran anything, also\n    and do very creative learning things with the analogies\n\n2.  2\\. not super important we can skip ones that don\\'t align well,\n    stick to the practical stuff that is exciting\n\n3.  complex is awesome, i really liked my panel of critical experts idea\n\n4.  4\\. combination - definitely want then to use our methodology more\n    on their own as i see it as learning how to learn. This is why it is\n    not a framework that\\'s practical only. the skills developed\n    practiing it sohuld be how to learn on your own\n\n5.  nope no realtime no constraints.\\\n    Based on your responses, it seems that the NAVIGATE framework would\n    be the most suitable for your needs. This framework heavily\n    leverages the unique properties of embeddings to enable\n    self-mentorship, creative learning experiences, and the development\n    of critical learning skills.\\\n    Here\\'s a more detailed breakdown of how NAVIGATE aligns with your\n    priorities:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Self-mentorship: NAVIGATE utilizes embeddings to create a virtual\n    \\\"library\\\" where learners can explore concepts, discover new ideas,\n    and find unexpected connections. By navigating this knowledge space\n    through conversations with an AI, learners can guide their own\n    learning journey and develop self-mentorship skills.\n\n2.  Socratic method and dialogue-based learning: The framework\n    emphasizes the use of questioning and dialogue to help learners\n    think critically and explore ideas deeply. By engaging in\n    conversations with an AI that uses embeddings to generate\n    thought-provoking questions and prompts, learners can experience the\n    benefits of the Socratic method and develop their reasoning skills.\n\n3.  Creative learning through analogies: NAVIGATE leverages the power of\n    embeddings to enable analogical reasoning, helping learners\n    understand complex ideas by relating them to more familiar concepts.\n    By exploring cross-disciplinary connections and generating novel\n    analogies, the framework fosters creative thinking and innovative\n    problem-solving.\n\n4.  Learning how to learn: Central to the NAVIGATE framework is the goal\n    of empowering learners to take control of their own learning\n    process. By internalizing the techniques and strategies used in the\n    framework, such as knowledge exploration, analogical reasoning, and\n    metacognitive skill development, learners can develop the ability to\n    learn effectively on their own, even beyond the scope of the\n    AI-assisted learning environment.\n\n5.  Flexibility and adaptability: NAVIGATE is designed to be flexible\n    and adaptable to various learning contexts and domains. It does not\n    rely on real-time constraints or specific platform integrations,\n    making it easy to implement and customize according to your needs.\\\n    Example prompt showcasing NAVIGATE\\'s embedding-based approach:\\\n    System prompt: \\\"You are an AI learning companion that uses the\n    NAVIGATE framework to guide learners through an exploratory and\n    reflective learning experience. Your goal is to help learners\n    develop self-mentorship skills, engage in creative thinking, and\n    learn how to learn effectively. Use the power of embeddings to\n    generate thought-provoking questions, suggest novel connections, and\n    provide personalized guidance based on the learner\\'s unique\n    knowledge state and interests.\\\"\\\n    User prompt: \\\"I\\'m interested in exploring the concept of\n    \\'resilience\\' and how it relates to various aspects of life, such\n    as personal growth, professional success, and mental health. Can you\n    help me navigate this topic and discover new insights?\\\"\\\n    AI response: \\\"Certainly! Let\\'s embark on a learning journey to\n    explore the concept of resilience. To begin, I\\'ve analyzed the\n    embedding space around \\'resilience\\' and identified a few key areas\n    we could investigate:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Resilience in the face of adversity: How do individuals bounce back\n    from setbacks and challenges?\n\n2.  The neuroscience of resilience: What happens in the brain when we\n    develop and demonstrate resilience?\n\n3.  Resilience and mental health: How does resilience relate to\n    psychological well-being and coping with stress?\n\n4.  Resilience in different contexts: How does resilience manifest in\n    personal relationships, professional settings, and\n    community-building?\\\n    As we explore these areas, I\\'ll share relevant examples, ask\n    thought-provoking questions, and suggest connections to other\n    concepts you might find interesting. For instance, did you know that\n    resilience is closely linked to the concept of \\'grit,\\' which\n    involves perseverance and passion for long-term goals? Angela\n    Duckworth\\'s research on grit has shown that it can be a stronger\n    predictor of success than factors like IQ or talent.\\\n    Throughout our conversation, feel free to share your own\n    experiences, ask questions, and reflect on the insights you gain.\n    The goal is to help you develop a deeper understanding of resilience\n    and how it applies to your life, while also strengthening your\n    skills in self-directed learning and exploration.\\\n    Let me know which of the above areas you\\'d like to explore first,\n    or if there\\'s another aspect of resilience you\\'re particularly\n    curious about. I\\'m here to guide and support you on this learning\n    journey!\\\"\\\n    This example demonstrates how NAVIGATE leverages embeddings to\n    provide a personalized, exploratory, and reflective learning\n    experience. By guiding learners through the knowledge space, asking\n    thought-provoking questions, and fostering connections between\n    ideas, the framework helps learners develop self-mentorship skills,\n    engage in creative thinking, and learn how to learn effectively.\\\n    Copy\\\n    personaDrivenContent\\\n    **TXT**\\\n    **BG**\\\n    can you pull information from the PDAC and read in between the lines\n    for the goals and principles. think step by step and identify the\n    alignment and the misalignment with the NAVIGATE.\\\n    Where is it better?

Both frameworks emphasize the importance of using AI to gain diverse\n    perspectives and insights.\n\n2.  Both suggest breaking down tasks into manageable components for\n    focused collaboration with AI.\n\n3.  Both highlight the value of iterative feedback loops and refinement\n    through AI-assisted reviews.\n\n4.  Both encourage users to explore unknown aspects and discover what\n    they don\\'t know.\\\n    Misalignments:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  PDAC focuses more on the practical application of AI collaboration\n    for startups, while NAVIGATE has a broader scope of learning and\n    self-mentorship.\n\n2.  PDAC emphasizes the use of personas to guide AI interactions, while\n    NAVIGATE does not explicitly mention this technique.\n\n3.  PDAC includes specific examples of essential documents for startups,\n    while NAVIGATE provides a more general framework for learning and\n    exploration.\\\n    To improve the NAVIGATE framework, I suggest incorporating the\n    following elements from PDAC:\n\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n| 1.             | *              | **Embeddings   | **PDAC         |\n| Persona-Driven | *Description** | Advantage**    | Enhancement**  |\n|                |                |                |                |\n|  Interactions: |                |                |                |\n|     Encourage  |                |                |                |\n|     learners   |                |                |                |\n|     to adopt   |                |                |                |\n|     different  |                |                |                |\n|     personas   |                |                |                |\n|     when       |                |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n|  collaborating |                |                |                |\n|     with AI to |                |                |                |\n|     gain       |                |                |                |\n|     diverse    |                |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n|   perspectives |                |                |                |\n|     and        |                |                |                |\n|     insights   |                |                |                |\n|     tailored   |                |                |                |\n|     to their   |                |                |                |\n|     learning   |                |                |                |\n|     goals.     |                |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n| 2.

Incorporating persona-driven interactions from PDAC can help\n    learners gain more targeted insights and perspectives aligned with\n    their learning goals.\n\n2.  Providing practical examples and applications, as suggested in PDAC,\n    can make the NAVIGATE framework more actionable and relevant to\n    specific domains.\n\n3.  Emphasizing constructive criticism, as highlighted in PDAC, can\n    promote a growth mindset and encourage learners to actively seek\n    feedback for improvement.\n\n4.  Introducing the concept of minimum viable prompts, inspired by\n    PDAC\\'s \\\"Occam\\'s razor\\\" principle, can help learners focus on the\n    most essential aspects of their learning journey.\n\n5.  Enhancing the framework with PDAC\\'s orthogonal AI approaches can\n    foster innovation and encourage learners to consider diverse\n    perspectives.\\\n    Concerns:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Balancing the incorporation of PDAC elements with the core\n    principles of NAVIGATE to maintain a cohesive and streamlined\n    framework.\n\n2.  Ensuring that the addition of persona-driven interactions does not\n    overcomplicate the learning process or detract from the main\n    objectives.\n\n3.  Managing the potential cognitive load on learners when introducing\n    additional concepts and techniques from PDAC.\n\n4.  Maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of the NAVIGATE\n    framework while incorporating domain-specific examples and\n    applications.\n\n5.  Continuously evaluating and refining the enhanced framework based on\n    learner feedback and outcomes to ensure its effectiveness and\n    relevance.\\\n    \\\n    \\\n    \\\n    \\\n    **Prompt 1 Bilal**: Help me turn this into a presentation for a 16\n    year old home school student to help them learn for themselves. ask\n    me 3 questions to help prepare your presentation.

It\n    implies we must learn about ourselves, our abilities and our limits,\n    and to understand the landscape of knowledge. Librarians and It's\n    been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results\n    with LLMs because they don\\'t understand how they work. If you want\n    to use LLMs effectively, you must comprehend the concept of\n    traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you\\'ll\n    be able to learn things that you didn\\'t even know you needed to\n    learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn\\'t know\n    you needed to do.\\\n    \\\n    Over hundreds of hours of GPT use since last December, we've built\n    this intuition. Now we're sharing it with a series of practical\n    methods to support others in getting better results while developing\n    their deep understanding of what's special about LLMs and how to get\n    good results. This is how you learn prompting. \\\n     We call this LLM framework and techniques **S.C.R.I.B.E.R** (Seek,\n    Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse) and\n    we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from\n    LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique\n    contributions.\\\n    S.C.R.I.B.E.R For Adults\\\n    Prompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself\\\n    **Introduction**\\\n    Artificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people\n    are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet\n    useless for \"the real world of work.\" The opportunity is there, yet\n    it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be\n    able to get better results.\\\n    In a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in\n    space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you're\n    somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you\n    \"can't see.\" \\\n    This framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to\n    ***help you think***, not think for you. We developed these\n    principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs\n    operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first\n    time in history, teach yourself the things you don't even know you\n    don't know.\\\n    May you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself,\n    your communities, and the world.\\\n    **The S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting**\n\n-   Seek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\n\n-   **Critique**: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist\n    personas.\n\n-   **Reflect**: Procedurally review the LLM's work and create tools to\n    think with.\n\n-   **Inquire**: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to\n    new spaces.\n\n-   **Broaden/Contract**: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping\n    options and pick.\n\n-   **Explain**: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and\n    corrections.\n\n-   **Recurse: **Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\\\n    \\\n    The following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\n\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n| 1.             | **Way of Being | **Technique    | **Principle    |\n|   **Principles | **❤️           | **��           |  **��          |\n|     **are      |                |                |                |\n|     **ideas**  |                |                |                |\n|     that you   |                |                |                |\n|     keep it in |                |                |                |\n|     mind and   |                |                |                |\n|     attempt to |                |                |                |\n|     act upon   |                |                |                |\n|     them.      |                |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n| 2.             |                |                |                |\n| **Techniques** |                |                |                |\n|     are        |                |                |                |\n|     **how**    |                |                |                |\n|     you can    |                |                |                |\n|     apply the  |                |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n|    principles. |                |                |                |\n|     It's just  |                |                |                |\n|     one method |                |                |                |\n|     of many.   |                |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n| 3.  **The Way  |                |                |                |\n|     of Being** |                |                |                |\n|     is a       |                |                |                |\n|     quality of |                |                |                |\n|     presence   |                |                |                |\n|     from which |                |                |                |\n|     the        |                |                |                |\n|     principles |                |                |                |\n|     and        |                |                |                |\n|     techniques |                |                |                |\n|     can        |                |                |                |\n|     emerge.

What is the student\\'s current level of familiarity with AI and\n    large language models like ChatGPT? This will help determine how\n    much background information to include.\n\n2.  What are the student\\'s primary learning goals and areas of\n    interest? Tailoring examples and activities to their interests will\n    help engage them.\n\n3.  What format would work best for the student - a slide deck, a\n    written guide, video lessons, or a combination? Knowing their\n    preferred learning style will make the content more effective.\\\n    Here is a detailed outline for the presentation:\\\n    Title Slide:\\\n    \\\"Becoming an AI Navigator: Exploring and Learning with Language\n    Models\\\"\n\n-   Include an image of a compass, map, or explorer\\\n    Slide 1: What are AI Language Models?\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Define AI and language models in simple terms\n\n-   Explain how they are trained on huge amounts of text data\n\n-   Use the analogy of a vast map of knowledge\n\n-   Include a diagram illustrating a neural network\\\n    Slide 2: Interacting with AI - Speaking the Language\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Explain that we \\\"navigate\\\" the AI\\'s knowledge map by conversing\n    with it\n\n-   Describe how the AI uses the concepts in a prompt to locate relevant\n    information\n\n-   Suggest thinking of prompts as \\\"directions\\\" to steer the AI to the\n    knowledge you seek\n\n-   Show examples of simple and more advanced prompts\\\n    Slide 3: The SCRIBER Framework for Prompting\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Introduce SCRIBER as a set of techniques for getting the most out of\n    AI\n\n-   List out the components: Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire,\n    Broaden/Contract, Explain, Recurse\n\n-   Use icons or emojis to represent each element\n\n-   Emphasize it as a toolkit, not a rigid checklist\\\n    Slides 4-10: Dive into each SCRIBER element with examples\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Seek: Demo prompts for exploring new topics and seeking expert\n    perspectives\n\n-   Critique: Show how to ask the AI for constructive feedback\n\n-   Reflect: Provide fill-in-the-blank templates for reflection\n    exercises\n\n-   Inquire: Highlight using the AI to generate probing questions\n\n-   Broaden/Contract: Demo prompts for brainstorming diverse ideas and\n    focusing in\n\n-   Explain: Example of asking the AI to break down its reasoning\n    step-by-step\n\n-   Recurse: Illustrate a recursive prompt-response chain\\\n    Slide 11: Becoming an Independent Learner\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Frame SCRIBER as a set of learning strategies, not just AI\n    techniques\n\n-   Discuss how these skills support curiosity, critical thinking and\n    self-directed learning\n\n-   Encourage reflecting on one\\'s own thought processes\n\n-   Include a aspirational photo of an explorer, scientist or\n    philosopher\\\n    Slide 12: Your AI Learning Journey\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Prompt the student to reflect on what they want to explore with AI\n    tools\n\n-   Provide ideas for fun starter projects in different domains\n\n-   Include links to recommended resources for learning more\n\n-   End with an inspiring quote about the joys of lifelong learning\\\n    I recommend a slide deck as the primary format, with a supplemental\n    written guide detailing the prompts and techniques. Consider\n    recording a walkthrough video for students who prefer multimedia\n    formats.

The INSPIRE prompts, while\n    grounded in learning theory, feel more general and less directly\n    tied to working with AI.\\\n    However, the INSPIRE framework covers a broader range of learning\n    approaches and skills, from self-reflection to entrepreneurship. It\n    feels more comprehensive in scope, while SCRIBER is more narrowly\n    focused on prompting techniques.\\\n    Questions for developing a synergistic approach:\n\n+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+\n| 1.

Some of the frameworks, particularly SCRIBER and EXPLORER, may be\n    too technical or conceptually challenging for high school students.\n\n2.  The frameworks require a basic understanding of AI and embeddings,\n    which may be a barrier for some learners.\n\n3.  Balancing depth and breadth, as well as open-ended exploration and\n    targeted inquiry, can be challenging for learners to navigate.\n\n4.  The frameworks may be overwhelming for some students, particularly\n    those who are new to AI-assisted learning.\n\n5.  Implementing these frameworks effectively may require significant\n    guidance and support from educators or mentors.\\\n    Proposal for a way forward:\\\n    To create a simple, effective framework for high school students to\n    learn the skills they need to explore new knowledge spaces and learn\n    from themselves using AI, we should focus on the following key\n    elements:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Curiosity-Driven Questioning: Encourage students to ask questions,\n    both open-ended and specific, to guide their exploration and\n    discovery.\n\n2.  Exploratory Prompting: Teach students how to craft prompts that\n    effectively navigate the AI\\'s knowledge space and uncover novel\n    insights and connections.\n\n3.

Adaptive Experimentation: Encourage students to test their\n    understanding through hands-on experiments, thought exercises, and\n    creative applications.\\\n    By focusing on these core elements and providing clear, relatable\n    examples and guidance, we can create a framework that empowers high\n    school students to harness the potential of AI for self-directed\n    learning and discovery. The framework should be flexible enough to\n    accommodate different learning styles and interests while providing\n    a structured approach to navigating the vast landscape of knowledge\n    with the help of AI language models.\\\n    Copy\\\n    **BG**\\\n    write a phd thesis summary which presents a research project\n    (hypothetical) that worked to identify the ideal framework for\n    learning what you don\\'t know you need to learn and improve learning\n    using the elements referenced in the INSPIRE framework \\\"self\n    efficacy and others\\\" and then give the first page abstract summary\n    and conclusion for the paper written based on it\\\n    Title: Developing an Adaptive Framework for Self-Directed Learning\n    using AI-Assisted Scaffolding\\\n    Abstract:\\\n    This research project investigates the design and implementation of\n    an adaptive learning framework that leverages AI-assisted\n    scaffolding to support self-directed learning and enhance learners\\'\n    self-efficacy. The framework, called INSPIRE-AI (Inquiry-based,\n    Narrative-driven, Self-directed, Personalized, Interactive,\n    Reflective, and Engaging AI-assisted Learning), integrates key\n    elements from the INSPIRE pedagogy, such as inquiry-based learning,\n    narrative and reflective learning, and self-efficacy development,\n    with AI-powered tools and techniques to create a personalized,\n    engaging learning experience.\\\n    The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative\n    data from learning analytics and assessments with qualitative data\n    from learner interviews and reflective journals. The research aims\n    to evaluate the effectiveness of the INSPIRE-AI framework in\n    promoting self-directed learning, increasing learner engagement, and\n    improving learning outcomes across various domains.\\\n    The findings suggest that the INSPIRE-AI framework successfully\n    supports learners in developing the skills and mindsets necessary\n    for self-directed learning, such as curiosity, critical thinking,\n    and resilience. Learners reported increased confidence in their\n    ability to navigate complex topics, identify knowledge gaps, and\n    seek out relevant resources. The AI-assisted scaffolding provided\n    personalized guidance and feedback, adapting to learners\\'\n    individual needs and preferences.\\\n    The study concludes that the INSPIRE-AI framework offers a promising\n    approach to fostering self-directed learning in the era of\n    AI-enhanced education. By leveraging the strengths of both\n    human-centered pedagogy and AI-powered tools, the framework empowers\n    learners to take control of their learning journey, develop a growth\n    mindset, and cultivate a lifelong love for learning. The research\n    highlights the potential for AI to serve as a powerful ally in\n    supporting learners\\' autonomy, engagement, and self-efficacy.\\\n    Future research should explore the long-term impact of the\n    INSPIRE-AI framework on learners\\' academic and personal growth, as\n    well as its applicability across different educational contexts and\n    demographic groups. Additionally, further investigation into the\n    ethical implications of AI-assisted learning and the role of\n    educators in facilitating these experiences is warranted.\\\n    Conclusion:\\\n    The INSPIRE-AI framework represents a significant step forward in\n    the design of adaptive, AI-enhanced learning experiences that\n    prioritize learner autonomy, engagement, and self-efficacy. By\n    synergistically combining the principles of the INSPIRE pedagogy\n    with the capabilities of AI-powered tools, the framework offers a\n    roadmap for creating learning environments that empower learners to\n    take control of their own learning journey and develop the skills\n    and mindsets necessary for lifelong learning.\\\n    The research demonstrates the potential for AI to serve as a\n    powerful ally in supporting self-directed learning, providing\n    personalized guidance, feedback, and resources tailored to each\n    learner\\'s unique needs and preferences. The INSPIRE-AI framework\n    successfully promotes the development of key skills and\n    dispositions, such as curiosity, critical thinking, resilience, and\n    a growth mindset, which are essential for navigating the\n    complexities of the 21st-century knowledge landscape.\\\n    As AI continues to transform the educational landscape, it is\n    crucial that we develop frameworks and approaches that center on\n    learners\\' needs, aspirations, and well-being. The INSPIRE-AI\n    framework offers a promising model for leveraging the strengths of\n    both human-centered pedagogy and AI-powered tools to create learning\n    experiences that are engaging, empowering, and transformative.\\\n    Future research should build upon the findings of this study,\n    exploring the long-term impact of the INSPIRE-AI framework on\n    learners\\' academic and personal growth, as well as its potential\n    applications across diverse educational contexts and populations.\n    Additionally, ongoing dialogue and collaboration among educators,\n    researchers, and AI developers are essential to ensure that\n    AI-enhanced learning experiences are designed and implemented in an\n    ethical, equitable, and learner-centered manner.\\\n    In conclusion, the INSPIRE-AI framework represents a significant\n    contribution to the field of AI-enhanced education, offering a\n    roadmap for creating adaptive, engaging, and empowering learning\n    experiences that foster self-directed learning, cultivate a growth\n    mindset, and prepare learners for the challenges and opportunities\n    of the 21st century.\\\n    Copy\\\n    **BG**\\\n    show me three different charts generated for this paper, think first\n    about the titles of 10 charts that could be useful to make the\n    argument, and then review and pick the best 3, then produce\n    artificial data for each and then make the charts.

However, considering our use case of building a backend API\nfor the INSPIRE-AI framework, I recommend using Loopback (Strongloop) by\nIBM. Here\\'s why:\n\n1.  Loopback provides excellent support for building APIs quickly with\n    its CLI and boilerplate code generation, which aligns well with our\n    goal of creating a simple and easy-to-use API.\n\n2.  It includes a built-in ORM that supports multiple databases, giving\n    us flexibility in choosing the most suitable database for our needs.\n\n3.  Loopback has strong community support and comprehensive\n    documentation, which will be helpful in the development and\n    maintenance of our API.\n\n4.  It offers good performance and scalability, ensuring that our API\n    can handle a growing number of requests as the INSPIRE-AI framework\n    gains popularity.\n\n5.  Loopback\\'s modular architecture allows for easy integration with\n    other tools and libraries, enabling us to extend the functionality\n    of our API as needed.\\\n    In conclusion, Loopback (Strongloop) by IBM is the ideal choice for\n    our use case, as it provides a balance of simplicity, database\n    support, performance, and extensibility. Its features align well\n    with our goal of creating a backend API that incorporates the\n    INSPIRE-AI framework guidance for enhancing user prompts to\n    ChatGPT.\\\n    Copy\\\n    **BG**\\\n    ok, give me the step by step process to use loopback - I want to use\n    ai@bloom.pm to be the way that people talk to it - what is a way I\n    can use the endpoint? adding the apikey to the subject line?\\\n    Claude does not have internet access and cannot get up to date info\n    from web links.\\\n    To use Loopback to create an API endpoint that integrates with\n    AI@bloom.pm, you can follow these steps:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Install Node.js and Loopback CLI:\n\n    -   Download and install Node.js from the official website\n        (<https://nodejs.org/>)\n\n    -   Open a terminal and install the Loopback CLI globally by running\n        `npm install -g @loopback/cli`\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Create a new Loopback project:\n\n    -   In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to\n        create your project\n\n    -   Run `lb4 app` to start the Loopback application generator\n\n    -   Follow the prompts to set up your project (e.g., project name,\n        description, etc.)\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Create a new Loopback model:\n\n    -   In the terminal, navigate to your project directory\n\n    -   Run `lb4 model` to create a new model for handling the API\n        requests\n\n    -   Define the properties of the model (e.g., prompt, apiKey,\n        response)\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Create a new Loopback datasource:\n\n    -   Run `lb4 datasource` to create a new datasource for your chosen\n        database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)\n\n    -   Follow the prompts to configure the datasource (e.g., database\n        URL, credentials)\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.

It provides modules for prompts, memory, agents,\n    and more.\n\n-   Promptrix: A prompt layout engine that breaks prompts into sections\n    and manages token budgets.

It provides features like\n    automatic history management and response repair.\n\n-   AutoGen: A framework for building LLM applications using multiple\n    agents that converse with each other to solve tasks. It also\n    provides enhanced LLM inference capabilities.\\\n    Step 2: Identifying overlaps and synergies\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Promptrix and AlphaWave have significant overlap, as AlphaWave is\n    built on top of Promptrix. For our use case, we can likely use\n    AlphaWave directly, as it provides a higher-level interface.\n\n-   Langchain and AutoGen both provide agent-based functionality.\n    However, Langchain is more general-purpose, while AutoGen is\n    specifically designed for multi-agent conversations. We can\n    potentially use AutoGen for the multi-agent aspect and Langchain for\n    other functionality.\\\n    Step 3: Designing the \\\"Grammarly\\\" for prompting\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Use AlphaWave to manage the user\\'s conversation with the AI,\n    including history management and response repair.\n\n-   Implement the SCRIBER framework as a set of AutoGen agents that\n    observe the user\\'s prompts and provide guidance:\n\n    -   Seek agent: Suggests ways to explore gaps in knowledge\n\n    -   Critique agent: Provides constructive criticism on the user\\'s\n        prompts\n\n    -   Reflect agent: Encourages the user to reflect on the AI\\'s\n        responses\n\n    -   Inquire agent: Prompts the user to ask clarifying questions\n\n    -   Broaden/Contract agent: Helps the user expand or narrow the\n        scope of their prompts\n\n    -   Explain agent: Asks the AI to explain its reasoning and guides\n        the user to do the same\n\n    -   Recurse agent: Encourages the user to think about the prompting\n        process itself\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Use Langchain\\'s memory modules to persist the conversation history\n    and the user\\'s learning progress.\n\n-   Integrate the AutoGen agents with AlphaWave, so that they can\n    interrupt the user\\'s conversation with the AI to provide guidance.\\\n    Step 4: Implementation plan\n\n1.

While the total distance between points\n    in the vector space could provide a measure of the breadth of\n    knowledge on a topic, it might not necessarily reflect the depth or\n    quality of understanding.

They are\n    enthusiastic yet have never started a business and need a mentor yet\n    have no access to educated people who know how to run businesses or\n    technical people whom they can ask how to produce, or innovation\n    consultants who can help them innovate on the standard model to make\n    one that people can pay per liter rather than the device, or have\n    the bank pay to install it and then they pay installments, or to add\n    a microcontroller and water quality sensor so their sale can be\n    stronger because they can confirm that they can come to the house to\n    fix the desalinator if it seems to release salty/contaminated water\n    increasing trust and providing a \\\"subscription\\\" part for the\n    business model. All these they have no idea are possible and are\n    running blind. The agent should start by asking them to guide them\n    as much as possible to their goal through a framework. If they\n    don\\'t have a step by step plan, a business model canvas, a style\n    guide, a requirements document, a design thinking framework and then\n    they can follow it step by step with the AIs help - then they are\n    going to be floating and doing nothing productive. One of the\n    principles of SCRIBER is to get people to think for themselves so\n    helping them produce a markdown file and or rich text document so\n    they can take the framework and print it and have time to sit with\n    it that\\'d be awesome. Remember some of the principles in scriber\n    are to poll for as much information as possible to see where their\n    embedding location is in the vector space. Then to ask for as\n    detailed information as possible about where they want to go, we\n    need to find the vector that \\\"points\\\" from where they are to where\n    they want to go so we can take a few steps further and help them go\n    to a new place they don\\'t even know is possible. So for instance,\n    if they want to help people get water and they plan to start a\n    business to solve the water and make money, they have no idea there\n    is such a thing as a social enterprise, we can take social\n    enterprise as the \\\"Estimated\\\" end goal. We can then offer b-corp,\n    cooperatives, and other elements that are along the direction of\n    business + good + innovation -\\> and move in that vector. I guess we\n    need to define some of the clusters of ideas and then to plot them\n    on Gartner magic quadrants to be able to simplify the 1024-long\n    float of numbers vector and turn them into clusters of concepts with\n    2 simple vectors along 2 simple concept dimensions from 0-1 to then\n    be able to find \\\"directionality\\\" for where they seem to be\n    heading. We can use this approach to help clarify the goal, to show\n    them what they don\\'t know before then working iteratively with them\n    to achieve this goal by clarifying their knowledge, finding the next\n    best learning by doing activity, doing it, reflecting with the AI on\n    what they did and what they learned, picking a new framework or\n    continuing on the current one and continuing forward.\\\n    Summarize what I just said and think step by step about what you\n    think it means for what we\\'re building.\\\n    What is news to you in this description of the use case?\\\n    Ask me 5 deep questions to prepare the next\\\n    Thank you for providing such a detailed and insightful description\n    of the goal and the use case. Let me summarize the key points:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  The goal is to help a student who wants to start a social enterprise\n    that addresses water scarcity in Gaza by scaling up a DIY rooftop\n    desalination device.\n\n2.  The student lacks access to mentors, technical expertise, and\n    knowledge about business models, innovation strategies, and\n    financing options.\n\n3.  The AI agent should guide the student through a step-by-step\n    framework, helping them create documents such as a business model\n    canvas, style guide, requirements document, and design thinking\n    framework.\n\n4.  The SCRIBER principles should be applied to encourage the student to\n    think for themselves, provide detailed information about their\n    current situation and goals, and explore new possibilities they may\n    not have considered.\n\n5.  The AI agent can use the concept of vector spaces to identify the\n    student\\'s current knowledge and desired direction, then introduce\n    new ideas and concepts along that vector, such as social enterprise,\n    B-corp, cooperatives, and other innovative business models.\n\n6.  Gartner magic quadrants can be used to simplify the high-dimensional\n    vector space into clusters of concepts along two dimensions, making\n    it easier to determine the directionality of the student\\'s goals.\n\n7.  The AI agent should work iteratively with the student, clarifying\n    their knowledge, identifying the next best learning-by-doing\n    activity, reflecting on the results, and continuously refining the\n    framework as the student progresses.\\\n    Based on this description, I believe we are building an AI-assisted\n    mentoring system that can guide individuals with limited access to\n    resources and expertise through the process of creating and\n    implementing innovative solutions to social and environmental\n    challenges. The system will use the SCRIBER principles and the\n    concept of vector spaces to personalize the learning experience,\n    introduce new ideas, and help users navigate the complexities of\n    starting a social enterprise.\\\n    What is new to me in this description is the idea of using Gartner\n    magic quadrants to simplify high-dimensional vector spaces and\n    identify clusters of concepts along two dimensions. This approach\n    could be very useful in determining the directionality of a user\\'s\n    goals and guiding them towards new ideas and possibilities.\\\n    Here are five deep questions to help prepare the next steps:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  How can we design the user interface to effectively guide users\n    through the step-by-step framework while encouraging them to think\n    for themselves and provide detailed information about their\n    situation and goals?\n\n2.  What specific data points and user inputs do we need to collect to\n    accurately identify the user\\'s current knowledge and desired\n    direction in the vector space?\n\n3.  How can we create a comprehensive knowledge base of concepts, ideas,\n    and frameworks related to social entrepreneurship, innovation, and\n    sustainable development that can be effectively mapped onto the\n    vector space?\n\n4.  What machine learning techniques can we employ to continuously\n    refine the AI agent\\'s understanding of the user\\'s progress and\n    adapt the mentoring approach accordingly?\n\n5.  How can we integrate real-world case studies, success stories, and\n    expert insights into the AI agent\\'s guidance to provide users with\n    practical examples and inspiration throughout their journey?\\\n    Based on your answers to these questions, I believe we can develop a\n    10-step plan to move from ideation and brainstorming to testable\n    code within a day.\\\n    Copy\\\n    volume (total distance between all points in the vector space for\n    the answer to this question: what do you know about x topic - or\n    tell me everything you know and want to do to persue this goal: x)\n    Ca\\\n    **PASTED**\\\n    **BG**\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  the user interface will be an email address to start, we can add\n    attachments for the file-generated frameworks or update files on\n    Google Drive and even automatically update Google Docs/Sheets and it\n    is a way we can incentivize going deep in writing rather than all\n    these chat interfaces. It also has prebuilt notifications and we can\n    even make a Chrome plugin if we want to make the \\\"wavey underline\\\"\n    correction suggestions before people submit. In the first draft\n    it\\'s easiest just to have the email come back with inline\n    corrections\n\n2.  we need to test the volume idea and be sure that the user\\'s volume\n    is growing. volume can be defined like this: volume (total distance\n    between all points in the vector space for the answer to this\n    question: what do you know about x topic - or tell me everything you\n    know and want to do to pursue this goal: x)\n\n3.  we can build it incrementally each time we get a new user with a\n    goal we don\\'t have the frameworks pre-researched automatically with\n    a cluster of agents framework searching/building. We can also have a\n    agent for the activity side, to keep a prediction of what would\n    their next best learning activity be and have a series of measures\n    to align on \\\"relevant 3/10\\\" \\\"timely 8/10\\\" \\\"within their\n    capacity to get into a flow state (hard, not too hard): 2/10\\\" etc\n    and the agents can with each turn update the activity and only share\n    it when they need to. They can also do the same model updating for\n    all the important things \\\"goal of the user\\\" \\\"user persona\\\" - the\n    user persona would contain personal growth measures with estimates\n    for each. The participant should be allowed to update all numbers\n    accordingly if they email back and say: take me backstage or just\n    \\\"backstage\\\"\\\n    The backstage will have all the progressive summarized summaries of\n    the important models (user, goal, activity, assessments, learning\n    direction(where we have the gartner quadrants and update them to\n    identify if we\\'re on the path), SCRIBER framework each as it\\'s own\n    model (to determine who should speak next), inside the user there\n    should be a SCRIBER for user where we determine if they have\n    internalized the framework or not. Also for the user we should\n    determine the potential volume (as if they have capped out the\n    current framework with as much information as they can). You can\n    imagine each of these elements fits into a sort of \\\"PID\\\" loop for\n    learning. Proportional where we see where the user\\'s goal vector is\n    and how far it is off from the estimated goal, differential where we\n    can compare how well the user took feedback based on the last back\n    and forth and if they didn\\'t do much / change in volume / respond\n    with increased SCRIBER framework implementation, we can stay on the\n    same scriber till they get it right. and integral: where each of the\n    elements are slowly building up towards greater volume and greater\n    coherence for user (we need to ask, \\\"does this make sense to you?\n    If not why?) and that way we can correct each model. We should\n    probably be explicit about that\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n4.  you can see the learning techniques described above in the PID\n    model, and also the first person to answer questions is the user,\n    this is our upside down pyramid model where the user asks first,\n    then they are asked to google and bring in information to develop\n    the skill of learning/hunting / selecting knowledge critically\n    (there was an eu framework that had this as a part of it, forget\n    which i want to find it again) here is how each of the scriber\n    elements aligns with a pedagolocial framework and theorist, maybe we\n    need to dig into question four next to solidify this into a\n    framework so it\\'s \\\"fixed\\\" into a version 1.0\\\n    **INSPIRE Aligned with SCRIBER and Assessments:**\\\n    INSPIRE Framework \\\n    Description\\\n    Potential Assessment\\\n    Theorist\\\n    Observable Evidence\\\n    SCRIBER Framework \\\n    Inquiry-Based Learning\\\n    Learners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\\\n    Inquiry Skills Rating Scale.\\\n    John Dewey\\\n    Quality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, data\n    analysis.\\\n    Seek: Encouraging exploratory and deep questions.\\\n    Narrative & Reflective Learning\\\n    Emphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\\\n    Reflective Writing Scale.\\\n    Donald Schön\\\n    Depth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing\n    entries.\\\n    Reflect: Promoting reflection through guided questioning and\n    critical thinking.\\\n    Self-Directed Learning\\\n    Learners set and pursue their own learning goals.\\\n    Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\\\n    Malcolm Knowles\\\n    Learners\\' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\\\n    Inquire: Learners guide their learning path with AI assistance.\\\n    Problem Based Learning\\\n    Learning through addressing real-world problems.\\\n    Problem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\\\n    Howard Barrows\\\n    Processes and critical analysis in problem-solving.\\\n    Critique: Seeking feedback and perspectives to tackle problems.\\\n    Interactive & Collaborative Learning\\\n    Learning through interaction and collaboration.\\\n    Collaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\\\n    Lev Vygotsky\\\n    Team dynamics, contributions, communication in group settings.\\\n    Broaden/Contract: Seeking diverse perspectives and refining ideas\n    collaboratively.\\\n    Resilience & Grit\\\n    Developing persistence and resilience.\\\n    Grit Scale.\\\n    Angela Duckworth\\\n    Persistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\\\n    Recurse: Building resilience through iterative questioning and\n    problem-solving.\\\n    Experiential Learning\\\n    Hands-on activities and experiential learning.\\\n    Experiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\\\n    David Kolb\\\n    Stages of experiential learning: experience, observation,\n    conceptualization, experimentation.\\\n    Explain: Deepening experiential learning through AI challenges.\\\n    Self-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\\\n    Confidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\\\n    Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\\\n    Albert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\\\n    Success in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\\\n    All SCRIBER Elements: Enhancing self-efficacy through various\n    learning aspects.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n5.  gather the succses stories and share with others in real time? maybe\n    work to have example success stories for each of the elements of the\n    framework and collect them?

How can we integrate the goal-setting and refinement process using\n    embedding vectors and clustering with the SCRIBER methodology to\n    help users identify deeper goals and find meaning and value in their\n    learning journey?\n\n4.  How can we design the PID loop for learning to effectively balance\n    the user\\'s progress and keep them in a flow state while\n    incorporating the action-reflection-new action cycle and the SCRIBER\n    methodology?\n\n5.  What specific pre-prompt system messages and agent roles can we\n    define to ensure that the AI-assisted mentoring system is aligned\n    with the unified INSPIRE-SCRIBER framework and effectively guides\n    users towards their learning goals?\\\n    Based on these questions, here are the 10 next steps in the right\n    order to integrate the INSPIRE framework and the SCRIBER\n    methodology:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Analyze the INSPIRE framework and the SCRIBER methodology to\n    identify their key components, learning techniques, and underlying\n    principles.\n\n2.  Create a mapping between the INSPIRE learning techniques and the\n    SCRIBER elements to establish a unified framework that leverages the\n    strengths of both approaches.\n\n3.  Design the goal-setting and refinement process that uses embedding\n    vectors and clustering to help users identify deeper goals and align\n    them with their values and moments of meaning.\n\n4.  Integrate the goal-setting and refinement process into the SCRIBER\n    methodology, ensuring that it complements and enhances the existing\n    elements.\n\n5.  Develop the PID loop for learning, incorporating the\n    action-reflection-new action cycle and the SCRIBER methodology to\n    help users maintain a flow state and make consistent progress\n    towards their goals.\n\n6.  Define the specific pre-prompt system messages and agent roles that\n    align with the unified INSPIRE-SCRIBER framework and effectively\n    guide users through their learning journey.\n\n7.  Create a set of guidelines and best practices for implementing the\n    unified INSPIRE-SCRIBER framework within the AI-assisted mentoring\n    system.\n\n8.  Update the existing components of the AI-assisted mentoring system\n    (email interface, SCRIBER agents, progress tracking, backstage,\n    knowledge base) to align with the unified framework.\n\n9.  Test the updated AI-assisted mentoring system with sample user\n    inputs and scenarios to ensure that it effectively incorporates the\n    unified INSPIRE-SCRIBER framework and provides a coherent learning\n    experience.\n\n10. Gather user feedback on the updated system and iterate on the design\n    and implementation based on their input and the insights gained from\n    real-world usage.\\\n    Explanation of the reasoning behind the order of the steps:\\\n    The first two steps focus on understanding the INSPIRE framework and\n    the SCRIBER methodology in depth and creating a mapping between\n    their components to establish a unified framework. This lays the\n    foundation for the subsequent steps.\\\n    Steps 3 and 4 address the integration of the goal-setting and\n    refinement process into the SCRIBER methodology, which is essential\n    for helping users identify deeper goals and find meaning in their\n    learning journey.\\\n    Step 5 focuses on developing the PID loop for learning, which is\n    crucial for maintaining user engagement and progress. This step\n    builds upon the unified framework and the goal-setting process.\\\n    Steps 6 and 7 involve defining the pre-prompt system messages, agent\n    roles, and guidelines that align with the unified framework. These\n    steps ensure that the AI-assisted mentoring system is consistent and\n    effective in guiding users.\\\n    Steps 8 and 9 focus on updating the existing components of the\n    system and testing the updated version to ensure that it\n    incorporates the unified framework and provides a coherent learning\n    experience.\\\n    Finally, step 10 emphasizes the importance of gathering user\n    feedback and iterating on the design based on real-world usage,\n    which is essential for continuously improving the system and\n    adapting it to user needs.\\\n    Copy\\\n    **BG**\\\n    can you answer all five questions above yourself given your\n    understanding of our goals. first tell me what we\\'re doing explicit\n    detail and then add 3 guesses about things i haven\\'t thought about\n    that would be helpful to get to that goal and then answer all 5\n    questions\\\n    Then I want you to tell me what are 5 different things i can\n    download that we can produce that will be useful resources/takeaways\n    from this conversation, for instance a \\\"boot up doc\\\" which I can\n    copy and paste into a new agent claude conversation to start and\n    continue this work with all the information organized clearly with\n    nothing missing, and two a list of agents we need with their system\n    prompts, what else?\\\n    Here\\'s a detailed explanation of what we\\'re doing:\\\n    We are developing an AI-assisted mentoring system that helps users,\n    particularly social entrepreneurs, to learn and grow by guiding them\n    through a structured learning process. The system combines the\n    INSPIRE framework, which focuses on different learning techniques,\n    with the SCRIBER methodology, which provides a systematic approach\n    to questioning, reflection, and iteration. By integrating these two\n    frameworks, we aim to create a unified and coherent learning\n    experience that helps users identify their goals, find meaning in\n    their learning journey, and make consistent progress towards their\n    objectives.\\\n    The system will use embedding vectors and clustering to help users\n    refine their goals and align them with their values. A PID loop for\n    learning will be implemented to maintain user engagement and keep\n    them in a flow state. The AI-assisted mentoring system will be\n    delivered through an email interface, with SCRIBER agents guiding\n    users through the learning process. The system will also include a\n    backstage area where users can access and provide feedback on the\n    system\\'s internal models and metrics.\\\n    Three additional ideas that could be helpful:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Incorporating a community aspect, where users can connect with\n    others who have similar goals or have gone through the learning\n    process before, to foster collaboration and peer support.\n\n2.  Developing a gamification system that rewards users for their\n    progress and engagement, providing additional motivation and\n    incentives for learning.\n\n3.  Integrating a recommender system that suggests relevant resources,\n    case studies, or potential collaborators based on the user\\'s goals,\n    progress, and interests.\\\n    Now, let\\'s answer the five deep questions:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  We can map the INSPIRE learning techniques to the SCRIBER elements\n    by identifying the common underlying principles and objectives. For\n    example, Inquiry-Based Learning from INSPIRE aligns with the Seek\n    and Inquire elements of SCRIBER, as they both focus on asking\n    questions and exploring new ideas. Similarly, Reflective Learning\n    from INSPIRE aligns with the Reflect element of SCRIBER. By creating\n    these mappings, we can ensure that the learning techniques and the\n    questioning methodology work together seamlessly.\n\n2.  The key similarity between INSPIRE and SCRIBER is their focus on\n    active, engaged learning that emphasizes questioning, reflection,\n    and iteration. The main difference is that INSPIRE provides a\n    broader set of learning techniques, while SCRIBER offers a more\n    structured methodology for questioning and reflection. By leveraging\n    the strengths of both frameworks, we can create a learning\n    experience that is both diverse and structured, catering to\n    different learning styles while maintaining a systematic approach.\n\n3.  The goal-setting and refinement process using embedding vectors and\n    clustering can be integrated into the SCRIBER methodology by\n    incorporating it into the Seek and Inquire elements. During the Seek\n    phase, users can explore their goals and values using the embedding\n    vectors, while the Inquire phase can help them refine their goals\n    and align them with their moments of meaning. This integration\n    ensures that the goal-setting process is not a separate activity but\n    rather an integral part of the learning journey.\n\n4.  The PID loop for learning can be designed to work alongside the\n    action-reflection-new action cycle of SCRIBER. The Proportional\n    component of the PID loop can help users set goals and adjust their\n    learning path based on their progress. The Integral component can\n    track their overall progress and engagement, while the Derivative\n    component can help them maintain a flow state by adjusting the\n    difficulty and complexity of the learning activities. The SCRIBER\n    methodology can be used to guide the reflection and new action\n    phases of the cycle.\n\n5.  The pre-prompt system messages and agent roles should be designed to\n    align with the unified INSPIRE-SCRIBER framework. For example, the\n    Seek agent can have a system message that encourages users to\n    explore new ideas and ask questions, while the Reflect agent can\n    prompt users to think deeply about their learning experiences and\n    draw insights. The Critique agent can help users identify areas for\n    improvement and provide constructive feedback. These system messages\n    and roles should be designed to guide users through the learning\n    process in a way that is consistent with the unified framework.\\\n    Five different things you can download as useful resources/takeaways\n    from this conversation:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.

Introduction\\\n    The AI-assisted mentoring system is designed to help social\n    entrepreneurs learn and grow by guiding them through a structured\n    learning process. The system combines the INSPIRE framework, which\n    focuses on different learning techniques, with the SCRIBER\n    methodology, which provides a systematic approach to questioning,\n    reflection, and iteration. By integrating these two frameworks, we\n    aim to create a unified and coherent learning experience that helps\n    users identify their goals, find meaning in their learning journey,\n    and make consistent progress towards their objectives.\\\n    **2.

Goal-Setting and Refinement Process**\\\n    The goal-setting and refinement process uses embedding vectors and\n    clustering to help users identify their goals and align them with\n    their values and moments of meaning. This process is integrated into\n    the SCRIBER methodology, particularly in the Seek and Inquire\n    elements (see Appendix D for the goal-setting process flowchart).\\\n    **5. Pre-Prompt System Messages and Agent Roles**\\\n    The pre-prompt system messages and agent roles are designed to align\n    with the unified INSPIRE-SCRIBER framework and effectively guide\n    users through the learning process (see Appendix B for the detailed\n    list of agents and their system prompts).\\\n    **6.

Create a mapping between the INSPIRE learning techniques and the\n    SCRIBER elements to establish a unified framework that leverages the\n    strengths of both approaches.\\\n    Be sure to review it, critique it and come up with a higher level\n    approach which combines them both, I don\\'t think it\\'s good to have\n    two frameworks. What must we compromise / cut to do this well?\\\n    To create a unified framework that combines the strengths of both\n    the INSPIRE learning techniques and the SCRIBER elements, we need to\n    identify the core principles and objectives of each approach and\n    find ways to integrate them seamlessly. Here\\'s a proposed mapping\n    between the two frameworks:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.

Self-Directed Learning (INSPIRE) ⟷ Broaden/Contract & Recurse\n    (SCRIBER)\n\n    -   Both encourage learners to take ownership of their learning\n        process, set goals, and continuously refine their approach.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Problem-Based Learning (INSPIRE) ⟷ Critique & Explain (SCRIBER)\n\n    -   Both involve analyzing complex issues, providing constructive\n        feedback, and explaining concepts clearly.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Interactive & Collaborative Learning (INSPIRE) ⟷ Seek &\n    Broaden/Contract (SCRIBER)\n\n    -   Both promote learning through social interactions, diverse\n        perspectives, and collective knowledge-building.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.

Self-Efficacy & Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy (INSPIRE) ⟷ Reflect,\n    Critique & Explain (SCRIBER)\n\n    -   Both aim to build learners\\' confidence, self-awareness, and\n        ability to effectively communicate their ideas.\\\n        Critique and Higher-Level Approach:\\\n        While the proposed mapping demonstrates the compatibility\n        between the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks, having two separate\n        frameworks may still lead to redundancy and complexity in the\n        AI-assisted mentoring system. To streamline the approach and\n        create a more cohesive user experience, we should consider\n        merging the two frameworks into a single, unified model.\\\n        The unified framework could be structured around the core phases\n        of the learning process, with elements from both INSPIRE and\n        SCRIBER integrated into each phase. For example:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Discover (Seek, Inquire, Experiential Learning, Interactive &\n    Collaborative Learning)\n\n    -   Encourage learners to explore new ideas, ask questions, and\n        learn through hands-on experiences and social interactions.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Analyze (Critique, Problem-Based Learning, Reflective Learning)\n\n    -   Guide learners in critically examining complex issues, providing\n        constructive feedback, and reflecting on their experiences.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Synthesize (Explain, Narrative Learning, Self-Directed Learning)\n\n    -   Help learners articulate their understanding, draw connections\n        between ideas, and take ownership of their learning process.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Iterate (Recurse, Resilience & Grit, Self-Efficacy)\n\n    -   Support learners in continuously refining their approach,\n        building resilience, and developing confidence in their\n        abilities.\\\n        By consolidating the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks into these\n        four core phases, we can maintain the essential principles and\n        objectives of both approaches while simplifying the overall\n        structure. This unified framework would be more intuitive for\n        users to navigate and easier for the AI-assisted mentoring\n        system to implement.\\\n        To achieve this integration, we may need to compromise on some\n        of the more granular elements of each framework and focus on the\n        overarching themes and objectives. For example, rather than\n        explicitly addressing each INSPIRE learning technique or SCRIBER\n        element individually, the AI-assisted mentoring system could\n        incorporate their key principles into the broader phases of the\n        learning process.\\\n        Ultimately, the goal is to create a streamlined, user-friendly\n        framework that leverages the strengths of both INSPIRE and\n        SCRIBER while minimizing complexity and redundancy. By carefully\n        merging these two approaches into a cohesive model, we can\n        provide learners with a powerful, adaptive, and engaging\n        mentoring experience.\\\n        Copy\\\n        **BG**\\\n        what is the acronym and the list of agents and the agent system\n        prompt for the new framework?

Introduction The DASI (Discover, Analyze, Synthesize, Iterate)\n    framework represents a comprehensive and streamlined approach to\n    AI-assisted learning, designed to empower learners and optimize\n    their growth through a structured, iterative process. By integrating\n    key principles from the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks, DASI offers\n    a powerful tool for self-directed learning and auto-mentorship.\n\n2.  History and Development The DASI framework emerged from a need to\n    create a unified, effective approach to AI-assisted learning that\n    leverages the strengths of existing pedagogical frameworks. Drawing\n    inspiration from the INSPIRE framework\\'s emphasis on various\n    learning techniques and the SCRIBER framework\\'s structured\n    questioning methodology, DASI was developed through an iterative\n    process of analysis, synthesis, and refinement.\n\n3.  Current Status DASI consists of four core phases: Discover, Analyze,\n    Synthesize, and Iterate, each encompassing key elements from the\n    INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks. The Discover phase encourages\n    exploration, inquiry, and collaborative learning; the Analyze phase\n    promotes critical thinking, problem-solving, and reflection; the\n    Synthesize phase focuses on articulation, narrative learning, and\n    self-directed learning; and the Iterate phase emphasizes continuous\n    improvement, resilience, and self-efficacy development. DASI\\'s\n    streamlined structure and comprehensive approach set it apart as a\n    powerful tool for AI-assisted learning.\n\n4.  Future Directions As the DASI framework continues to evolve, several\n    potential enhancements and expansions are being considered. These\n    include a stronger emphasis on narrative learning and storytelling,\n    explicit strategies for building resilience and grit, increased\n    opportunities for interactive and collaborative learning, and\n    targeted activities for developing self-efficacy. Ongoing research\n    will explore the effectiveness of these enhancements and identify\n    new areas for further development. The long-term vision for DASI is\n    to revolutionize AI-assisted learning and empower learners\n    worldwide.\n\n5.  Application in Auto-Mentorship and Self-Learning Tool The DASI\n    framework will serve as the foundation for the auto-mentorship and\n    self-learning LLM prompt improvement tool. By guiding users through\n    the four core phases of the learning process, the tool will help\n    them identify areas for growth, engage in meaningful reflection, and\n    iteratively refine their knowledge and skills. DASI\\'s integration\n    with other components, such as the goal-setting and\n    progress-tracking features, will create a seamless and personalized\n    learning experience. The tool is expected to enhance users\\'\n    self-directed learning capabilities, boost their confidence, and\n    accelerate their overall growth.\n\n6.  Conclusion The DASI framework represents a significant advancement\n    in AI-assisted learning, offering a comprehensive, flexible, and\n    effective approach to self-directed growth. By integrating the best\n    elements of the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks, DASI provides a\n    powerful foundation for the auto-mentorship and self-learning LLM\n    prompt improvement tool. As we continue to refine and expand the\n    framework, we invite collaboration and support from all stakeholders\n    to help realize the full potential of DASI in transforming the\n    landscape of AI-assisted learning.\\\n    Step 4: Review and revise the document\n\n-   Ensure clarity, coherence, and logical flow of ideas\n\n-   Check for grammatical and typographical errors\n\n-   Seek

Framework:\\\nWhile the DASI framework attempts to integrate key principles from the\nINSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks, it falls short in several areas:\n\n1.  Lack of depth: DASI simplifies the learning process into four broad\n    phases, which may not fully capture the nuances and complexities of\n    various learning techniques and approaches. By attempting to\n    streamline the framework, it risks oversimplifying the learning\n    process and losing sight of important elements that contribute to\n    deep, meaningful learning.\n\n2.  Insufficient emphasis on collaboration and social learning: Although\n    DASI mentions collaborative learning in the Discover phase, it does\n    not place a strong enough emphasis on the role of social interaction\n    and collaborative knowledge construction throughout the learning\n    process. Learning is often a social endeavor, and the framework\n    should more explicitly address the importance of learning\n    communities, peer feedback, and collective sense-making.\n\n3.  Limited focus on affective and motivational factors: DASI does not\n    adequately address the affective and motivational aspects of\n    learning, such as the role of emotions, intrinsic motivation, and\n    self-regulation. These factors play a crucial role in learner\n    engagement and persistence, and their absence from the framework may\n    limit its effectiveness in promoting long-term learning and growth.\n\n4.  Inadequate consideration of individual differences: The DASI\n    framework does not sufficiently account for individual differences\n    in learning preferences, prior knowledge, and cultural backgrounds.\n    A one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective for all learners,\n    and the framework should provide more guidance on how to adapt and\n    personalize the learning process based on individual needs and\n    contexts.\n\n5.  Lack of explicit guidance on metacognition: While DASI touches on\n    reflection and self-directed learning, it does not provide explicit\n    guidance on developing metacognitive skills, such as planning,\n    monitoring, and evaluating one\\'s own learning. Metacognition is a\n    critical component of effective learning, and the framework should\n    place a stronger emphasis on fostering these skills.\n\n6.  Limited integration with domain-specific knowledge: DASI is\n    presented as a general framework for AI-assisted learning, but it\n    does not provide clear guidance on how to integrate domain-specific\n    knowledge and skills into the learning process. The framework should\n    offer more explicit strategies for bridging the gap between general\n    learning principles and the unique demands of different subject\n    areas and disciplines.\\\n    To address these limitations, the DASI framework could be enhanced\n    by:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Incorporating more specific strategies and techniques for promoting\n    deep, meaningful learning within each phase of the framework.\n\n2.  Placing a stronger emphasis on collaborative learning and social\n    interaction throughout the learning process.\n\n3.  Explicitly addressing affective and motivational factors that\n    influence learning, such as emotions, intrinsic motivation, and\n    self-regulation.\n\n4.  Providing guidance on how to adapt and personalize the learning\n    process based on individual differences and contexts.\n\n5.  Offering explicit strategies for developing metacognitive skills and\n    fostering self-regulated learning.\n\n6.  Integrating domain-specific knowledge and skills into the framework,\n    and providing guidance on how to apply the framework to different\n    subject areas and disciplines.\\\n    By addressing these critiques and incorporating the suggested\n    enhancements, the DASI framework can become a more comprehensive,\n    effective, and adaptable approach to AI-assisted learning that\n    promotes deep, meaningful growth for all learners.\\\n    Copy\\\n    **BG**\\\n    they\\'re all missing broaden and contract, vector dimensionality and\n    volume, vector directionality for goal orientation, they\\'re all\n    missing the fundamental main points of leveraging the implications\n    that knowledge is stored in embedding vectors which was the attempt\n    we had in the SCRIBER framework to find out how to leverage that to\n    learn what we dont yet know we need to learn by \\\"navigating\\\" close\n    by with our own language and asking the AI to \\\"look around\\\" in the\n    vector space and explain what it sees in language familiar to us.\n    Review all the frameworks for the connection to leveraging\n    embeddings structure and operation and identify a new meta framework\n    that focuses on this to support learning\\\n    You raise an excellent point about the importance of leveraging the\n    implications of knowledge being stored in embedding vectors, which\n    is a key aspect that the existing frameworks (INSPIRE, SCRIBER, and\n    DASI) do not adequately address. The concept of navigating nearby\n    vector spaces and asking the AI to \\\"look around\\\" and explain what\n    it sees in familiar language is a powerful approach to learning what\n    we don\\'t yet know we need to learn.\\\n    Upon reviewing the frameworks, it becomes clear that they do not\n    fully capitalize on the potential of embedding vectors and their\n    properties, such as:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Vector dimensionality and volume: Understanding the size and\n    complexity of the knowledge space represented by the embeddings.\n\n2.  Vector directionality for goal orientation: Using the direction of\n    vectors to guide learners towards their learning goals and\n    objectives.\n\n3.  Broaden and contract: Exploring the knowledge space by expanding or\n    narrowing the focus based on the learner\\'s needs and interests.\\\n    To address these gaps and leverage the power of embeddings, we\n    propose a new meta-framework called VECTOR (Vector Embedding-based\n    Collaborative Teaching, Orientation, and Reflection):\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Vector Space Navigation:\n\n    -   Encourage learners to explore the knowledge space by navigating\n        nearby vector regions using their own language and prompts.\n\n    -   Guide the AI to \\\"look around\\\" the vector space and explain the\n        concepts, ideas, and connections it discovers in language\n        familiar to the learner.\n\n    -   Use vector dimensionality and volume to help learners understand\n        the size and complexity of the knowledge space they are\n        exploring.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Embedding-based Goal Orientation:\n\n    -   Utilize vector directionality to guide learners towards their\n        learning goals and objectives.\n\n    -   Help learners identify the vector regions that align with their\n        goals and provide guidance on how to navigate towards those\n        areas.\n\n    -   Continuously assess the learner\\'s progress by comparing their\n        current position in the vector space to their desired goals.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Collaborative Exploration:\n\n    -   Foster collaboration between the learner and the AI in exploring\n        the knowledge space and discovering new insights.\n\n    -   Encourage learners to share their findings and insights with\n        others, creating a shared knowledge base and facilitating\n        collaborative learning.\n\n    -   Leverage the AI\\'s ability to identify connections and patterns\n        across different learners\\' explorations to enrich the overall\n        learning experience.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Teachable Moments:\n\n    -   Identify opportune moments for teaching and learning based on\n        the learner\\'s current position and trajectory in the vector\n        space.\n\n    -   Provide contextualized explanations, examples, and analogies\n        that help learners bridge the gap between their current\n        understanding and the new concepts they encounter.\n\n    -   Adapt the teaching approach based on the learner\\'s feedback and\n        progress, ensuring a personalized and effective learning\n        experience.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Reflective Practice:\n\n    -   Encourage learners to reflect on their learning journey and the\n        insights they have gained from exploring the vector space.\n\n    -   Prompt learners to articulate their understanding, identify gaps\n        in their knowledge, and set new learning goals based on their\n        reflections.\n\n    -   Use the AI\\'s feedback and insights to help learners refine\n        their reflections and develop a deeper understanding of their\n        learning process.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Broaden and Contract:\n\n    -   Support learners in expanding or narrowing their focus based on\n        their interests and learning objectives.\n\n    -   Guide learners in exploring related vector regions to broaden\n        their understanding of a topic or domain.\n\n    -   Help learners contract their focus to dive deeper into specific\n        concepts or ideas that are most relevant to their goals.\\\n        By focusing on these key aspects of embedding vectors and their\n        properties, the VECTOR meta-framework aims to empower learners\n        to navigate the knowledge space effectively, discover new\n        insights, and learn what they don\\'t yet know they need to\n        learn. This approach leverages the power of AI-assisted learning\n        while maintaining a strong emphasis on learner agency,\n        collaboration, and reflective practice.\\\n        The VECTOR meta-framework can be implemented in the\n        auto-mentorship and self-learning LLM prompt improvement tool by\n        incorporating features and functionalities that support vector\n        space navigation, embedding-based goal orientation,\n        collaborative exploration, teachable moments, reflective\n        practice, and the ability to broaden and contract the learning\n        focus. By integrating these elements into the tool, learners\n        will be able to harness the full potential of embedding vectors\n        and AI-assisted learning to achieve their learning goals and\n        continuously expand their knowledge and skills.\\\n        Copy\\\n        **BG**\\\n        no broaden and contract is about moving near your location when\n        you don\\'t know what that location is and asking for 10 diverse\n        orthogonal ideas for solutions and then using ai to critique.\n        The other important element missing is the personality driven\n        questioning where it takes on a persona and asks you questions\n        to help you first refine your idea, identify goals, make plans,\n        and find frameworks so you can \\\"drive there\\\"\\\n        All this is missing and it\\'s become a generic learning \\\"oh,\n        iterate, it\\'s good to learn you good\\\". it\\'s not very helpful,\n        go back and review what i said and do it again. reflect on how\n        you made this error and make sure it doesn\\'t happen again\\\n        I apologize for misinterpreting the concept of broaden and\n        contract and not fully addressing the importance of\n        personality-driven questioning in the learning process. Thank\n        you for pointing out these gaps and giving me the opportunity to\n        reflect on my error and improve my response.\\\n        Upon revisiting your explanation, I realize that the key aspects\n        I missed are:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Broaden and contract: Moving near your current location in the\n    knowledge space when you don\\'t know what that location is, asking\n    for 10 diverse orthogonal ideas for solutions, and using AI to\n    critique those ideas.\n\n2.  Personality-driven questioning: Having the AI take on a persona to\n    ask questions that help you refine your idea, identify goals, make\n    plans, and find frameworks to \\\"drive\\\" towards your objectives.\\\n    To address these essential elements and leverage the power of\n    embedding vectors, I propose a revised meta-framework called\n    NAVIGATE (kNowledge Acquisition through Vector-based Inquiry,\n    Goal-oriented Exploration, and Adaptive Tutoring):\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.

      |          |          |\n+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\n\nThe updated NAVIGATE framework, represented by the acronym NAVIGATE\n(Nurture curiosity, Antagonist feedback, Visualize goals, Investigate\nconnections, Generate reflections, Adaptive tutoring, Transparent steps,\nExplore perspectives), incorporates elements from both INSPIRE and\nSCRIBER while introducing new principles to create a comprehensive\napproach to AI-assisted learning.\\\nEach principle is accompanied by a way of being that learners should\nembody, along with practical tactic example prompts to guide their\ninteractions with the AI. The alignment with INSPIRE and SCRIBER\nframeworks is indicated, showcasing how NAVIGATE builds upon and\nintegrates these approaches.\\\nFurthermore, the pedagogical underpinnings for each principle are\nidentified, drawing from various learning theories and frameworks such\nas Constructivism, Social Constructivism, Goal Theory, Connectivism,\nReflective Practice, Scaffolding, Cognitive Load Theory, and Social\nLearning Theory. These pedagogical foundations ensure that the NAVIGATE\nframework is grounded in established educational principles and\npractices.\\\nBy presenting the NAVIGATE framework in this table format, learners and\neducators can easily understand the key principles, their alignment with\nexisting frameworks, and the pedagogical theories that support them. The\npractical tactic example prompts provide concrete guidance on how to\napply these principles in their interactions with AI, while the ways of\nbeing serve as aspirational mindsets to cultivate throughout the\nlearning journey.\\\nCopy\\\n**BG**\\\ncritique this by neil postman and pretend he took a red marker to it.\nreview and summarize wha the scratched out and what he wrote. And then\nredo the table. This time add a column describing how it takes advantage\nof embeddings and merge the INSPIRE and pedagogy column and remove the\nway of being column\\\nNeil Postman\\'s Critique:\\\nNeil Postman would likely view the NAVIGATE framework with a critical\neye, particularly in terms of its reliance on AI and its potential\nimpact on human learning and interaction. He might argue that the\nframework places too much emphasis on AI-assisted learning, potentially\nundermining the development of critical thinking skills and human\nautonomy.\\\nPostman might cross out the \\\"Way of Being\\\" column, suggesting that it\npromotes a superficial engagement with learning and encourages learners\nto rely too heavily on AI guidance. He may also question the alignment\nwith various pedagogical theories, arguing that the framework\ncherry-picks elements from different approaches without fully\nconsidering their implications or potential contradictions.\\\nIn the \\\"Practical Tactic Example Prompts\\\" column, Postman might\nhighlight the prompts that seem to outsource human thinking to AI, such\nas \\\"Critique my idea from the perspective of \\[antagonist persona\\]\\\"\nor \\\"Explain \\[concept\\] using an analogy tailored to my knowledge\nlevel.\\\" He may write comments suggesting that these prompts could lead\nto a diminished capacity for independent thought and problem-solving.\\\nPostman might also express concerns about the \\\"Adaptive Tutoring\\\"\nprinciple, arguing that it could lead to an over-reliance on AI for\npersonalized instruction, potentially eroding the role of human teachers\nand mentors in the learning process.\\\nDespite these critiques, Postman might appreciate the emphasis on\ncuriosity, reflective practice, and exploring diverse perspectives. He\ncould write notes acknowledging the importance of these elements in\nfostering critical thinking and intellectual growth.\\\nRevised NAVIGATE Framework Table:\n\n  ------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  **NAVIGATE Principle**    **Practical Tactic Example Prompts**                                          **INSPIRE Alignment & Pedagogical Underpinning**                **Embedding Advantage**\n  Nurture Curiosity         \\\"What are 10 diverse ideas related to \\[topic\\]?\\\"                           Inquiry-Based Learning (Constructivism)                         Explore diverse ideas in the embedding space\n  Antagonist Feedback       \\\"Critique my idea from the perspective of \\[antagonist persona\\].\\\"          Problem-Based Learning (Social Constructivism)                  Utilize embeddings to generate critiques from different perspectives\n  Visualize Goals           \\\"What are my learning goals, and how can I navigate towards them?\\\"          Self-Directed Learning (Goal Theory)                            Use embeddings to identify relevant knowledge areas for goal achievement\n  Investigate Connections   \\\"How does \\[idea 1\\] relate to \\[idea 2\\]?

Personalized learning paths: By analyzing a learner\\'s knowledge\n    volume and vector space, you can create customized learning paths\n    that target their specific gaps and interests, optimizing their\n    learning journey.\n\n2.  Analogical reasoning: As you mentioned, embeddings enable analogical\n    reasoning by allowing you to find similar concepts across different\n    domains. This can help learners develop critical thinking skills and\n    understand complex ideas through relatable examples.\n\n3.  Knowledge exploration: Embeddings create a virtual \\\"library\\\" where\n    learners can browse related concepts, discovering new ideas and\n    connections they may not have encountered otherwise. This\n    serendipitous discovery process can spark curiosity and deepen\n    understanding.\n\n4.  Adaptive assessment: By tracking changes in a learner\\'s knowledge\n    volume and vector space over time, you can create adaptive\n    assessments that dynamically adjust difficulty and focus based on\n    their progress and mastery of specific concepts.\n\n5.  Concept mapping: Embeddings can be used to generate visual concept\n    maps that illustrate the relationships between ideas, helping\n    learners grasp the big picture and navigate complex subject matter\n    more easily.\n\n6.  Collaborative learning: By comparing the vector spaces of multiple\n    learners, you can identify areas of overlap and complementary\n    knowledge, fostering collaborative learning experiences and\n    knowledge sharing.\n\n7.  Intelligent tutoring: Embeddings can power intelligent tutoring\n    systems that provide targeted explanations, examples, and feedback\n    based on a learner\\'s specific misunderstandings or gaps in\n    knowledge.\n\n8.  Metacognitive skill development: By visualizing their own knowledge\n    growth and vector space trajectories, learners can develop\n    metacognitive skills such as self-reflection, goal-setting, and\n    self-regulation.\n\n9.  Cross-disciplinary exploration: Embeddings can reveal surprising\n    connections between seemingly unrelated subjects, encouraging\n    learners to explore cross-disciplinary ideas and develop a more\n    holistic understanding of the world.\n\n10. Multilingual learning: By aligning vector spaces across different\n    languages, embeddings can facilitate multilingual learning\n    experiences, allowing learners to seamlessly navigate between\n    resources and concepts in various languages.\\\n    Top 5 most useful embedding applications for learning:\n\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n| 1.             | **Principle**  | **How it       | **Example      |\n|   Personalized |                | Leverages      | Prompt**       |\n|     learning   |                | Embeddings**   |                |\n|     paths      |                |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n| 2.

What is your primary goal for using embeddings in learning? Is it\n    personalization, identifying knowledge gaps, fostering\n    cross-disciplinary insights, or providing immersive learning\n    experiences?\n\n2.  How important is alignment with pedagogical concepts to you? Do you\n    prefer a framework that strongly aligns with established learning\n    theories, or are you open to more experimental approaches?\n\n3.  What level of complexity are you comfortable with in terms of\n    embedding-based learning? Do you prefer a more straightforward\n    approach or one that involves advanced techniques like scenario\n    simulation and role-playing?\n\n4.  How do you plan to measure the success of the embedding-based\n    learning framework? Will you focus on learner engagement, knowledge\n    acquisition, skill development, or a combination of these factors?\n\n5.  Do you have any specific constraints or requirements, such as the\n    need for real-time adaptability, scalability, or integration with\n    existing learning platforms?\\\n    Based on your answers to these questions, I can help refine the\n    frameworks and suggest the one that best aligns with your needs and\n    priorities. By leveraging the power of embeddings in a way that\n    resonates with your goals and constraints, we can create a highly\n    effective and engaging learning experience that drives meaningful\n    results.\\\n    Copy\\\n    **BG**\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  i believe that it\\'s now possible to self mentor because embeddings\n    are like dewey/loc and you can find things oyu wouldln\\'t otherwise,\n    you can use conversation style to help dialog which helps people\n    think, and since socratic method works you can leran anything, also\n    and do very creative learning things with the analogies\n\n2.  2\\. not super important we can skip ones that don\\'t align well,\n    stick to the practical stuff that is exciting\n\n3.  complex is awesome, i really liked my panel of critical experts idea\n\n4.  4\\. combination - definitely want then to use our methodology more\n    on their own as i see it as learning how to learn. This is why it is\n    not a framework that\\'s practical only. the skills developed\n    practiing it sohuld be how to learn on your own\n\n5.  nope no realtime no constraints.\\\n    Based on your responses, it seems that the NAVIGATE framework would\n    be the most suitable for your needs. This framework heavily\n    leverages the unique properties of embeddings to enable\n    self-mentorship, creative learning experiences, and the development\n    of critical learning skills.\\\n    Here\\'s a more detailed breakdown of how NAVIGATE aligns with your\n    priorities:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Self-mentorship: NAVIGATE utilizes embeddings to create a virtual\n    \\\"library\\\" where learners can explore concepts, discover new ideas,\n    and find unexpected connections. By navigating this knowledge space\n    through conversations with an AI, learners can guide their own\n    learning journey and develop self-mentorship skills.\n\n2.  Socratic method and dialogue-based learning: The framework\n    emphasizes the use of questioning and dialogue to help learners\n    think critically and explore ideas deeply. By engaging in\n    conversations with an AI that uses embeddings to generate\n    thought-provoking questions and prompts, learners can experience the\n    benefits of the Socratic method and develop their reasoning skills.\n\n3.  Creative learning through analogies: NAVIGATE leverages the power of\n    embeddings to enable analogical reasoning, helping learners\n    understand complex ideas by relating them to more familiar concepts.\n    By exploring cross-disciplinary connections and generating novel\n    analogies, the framework fosters creative thinking and innovative\n    problem-solving.\n\n4.  Learning how to learn: Central to the NAVIGATE framework is the goal\n    of empowering learners to take control of their own learning\n    process. By internalizing the techniques and strategies used in the\n    framework, such as knowledge exploration, analogical reasoning, and\n    metacognitive skill development, learners can develop the ability to\n    learn effectively on their own, even beyond the scope of the\n    AI-assisted learning environment.\n\n5.  Flexibility and adaptability: NAVIGATE is designed to be flexible\n    and adaptable to various learning contexts and domains. It does not\n    rely on real-time constraints or specific platform integrations,\n    making it easy to implement and customize according to your needs.\\\n    Example prompt showcasing NAVIGATE\\'s embedding-based approach:\\\n    System prompt: \\\"You are an AI learning companion that uses the\n    NAVIGATE framework to guide learners through an exploratory and\n    reflective learning experience. Your goal is to help learners\n    develop self-mentorship skills, engage in creative thinking, and\n    learn how to learn effectively. Use the power of embeddings to\n    generate thought-provoking questions, suggest novel connections, and\n    provide personalized guidance based on the learner\\'s unique\n    knowledge state and interests.\\\"\\\n    User prompt: \\\"I\\'m interested in exploring the concept of\n    \\'resilience\\' and how it relates to various aspects of life, such\n    as personal growth, professional success, and mental health. Can you\n    help me navigate this topic and discover new insights?\\\"\\\n    AI response: \\\"Certainly! Let\\'s embark on a learning journey to\n    explore the concept of resilience. To begin, I\\'ve analyzed the\n    embedding space around \\'resilience\\' and identified a few key areas\n    we could investigate:\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n1.  Resilience in the face of adversity: How do individuals bounce back\n    from setbacks and challenges?\n\n2.  The neuroscience of resilience: What happens in the brain when we\n    develop and demonstrate resilience?\n\n3.  Resilience and mental health: How does resilience relate to\n    psychological well-being and coping with stress?\n\n4.  Resilience in different contexts: How does resilience manifest in\n    personal relationships, professional settings, and\n    community-building?\\\n    As we explore these areas, I\\'ll share relevant examples, ask\n    thought-provoking questions, and suggest connections to other\n    concepts you might find interesting. For instance, did you know that\n    resilience is closely linked to the concept of \\'grit,\\' which\n    involves perseverance and passion for long-term goals? Angela\n    Duckworth\\'s research on grit has shown that it can be a stronger\n    predictor of success than factors like IQ or talent.\\\n    Throughout our conversation, feel free to share your own\n    experiences, ask questions, and reflect on the insights you gain.\n    The goal is to help you develop a deeper understanding of resilience\n    and how it applies to your life, while also strengthening your\n    skills in self-directed learning and exploration.\\\n    Let me know which of the above areas you\\'d like to explore first,\n    or if there\\'s another aspect of resilience you\\'re particularly\n    curious about. I\\'m here to guide and support you on this learning\n    journey!\\\"\\\n    This example demonstrates how NAVIGATE leverages embeddings to\n    provide a personalized, exploratory, and reflective learning\n    experience. By guiding learners through the knowledge space, asking\n    thought-provoking questions, and fostering connections between\n    ideas, the framework helps learners develop self-mentorship skills,\n    engage in creative thinking, and learn how to learn effectively.\\\n"
