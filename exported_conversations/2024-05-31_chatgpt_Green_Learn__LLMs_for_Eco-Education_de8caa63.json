The concept note is available online for your reference.\n\nRecognized as one of the “UN Intergovernmental and Multi-Stakeholder Digital Cooperation Bodies and Forums”,this annual event convenes the community of digital education leaders, policy-makers, researchers and practitioners from various organizations, including UN agencies, governments, NGOs, academia and the private sector.\n\nDigital Learning Week 2024 aims to promote multi-stakeholder cooperation towards a human-centred and green design and use of AI in education, with a specific focus on exploring the interlinkages between digital transformation and greening education.\n\nTo surface best practices and facilitate knowledge sharing on the intersection of digital and green transformations, UNESCO is currently selecting presentations through a call for proposals. A separate call for presentations on the theme of AI and education is available here.\n\nSelected presenters will have the unique opportunity to address a global audience comprising policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, private sector partners and development agencies.\n\nPlease note that UNESCO mainly seeks proposals pertaining to practices that have been implemented at scale, which means that conceptual ideas without practical implementation are not preferable.\n\nThe form below requests a narrative description of your presentations while personal information such as email addresses will not be shared. If your presentation is selected for inclusion in the programme, the description you provide will be used directly on the UNESCO website and other communication materials. Please allow yourself sufficient time to complete the required fields and ensure clarity and readability of the text. Only proposals in English or French will be considered.\n\nPresentation proposals must be submitted to UNESCO no later than 5 June 2024.

Greening education empowers learners with the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to engage in transformative action on mitigation, adaptation and resilience to climate change, with the aim of shaping green, low emission climate-resilient societies.\n\nGreen technologies, also known as sustainable or eco-friendly technologies, are innovations aimed at reducing negative environmental impacts and promoting sustainability. These technologies are designed to minimize resource consumption, decrease pollution, and mitigate climate change (green design).\n\n \n1. Please select the sub-theme of your presentation *\nTheme selected:C.2 Good practices of AI tools to identify and counteract misinformation on climate change (e.g. fact-checking AI algorithms, safeguards against content manipulation and deepfakes on climate change, bots to identify misinformation, etc.)\nB.2 Good practices of using digital technology for promoting responsible climate actions.\n\nuse this content betweeen 3 brackets [[[Title: GREEN LEARN: Greening Aspirations through Supporting Metacognition and Aspirational Re-appraisal Using Large Language Models\n\nNarrative Description:\n\nIn my presentation, \"GREEN LEARN: Greening Aspirations through Supporting Metacognition and Aspirational Re-appraisal Using Large Language Models (LLMs),\" I will explore the transformative potential of LLMs in fostering a green, human-centered educational landscape. Drawing from my extensive experience with non-profits and social enterprises, I have gathered qualitative data on how these organizations perceive and utilize LLMs, often treating them as another type of software. This presentation will introduce a novel approach: integrating a system prompt designed to support goal reappraisal and promote metacognition, with the aim of nurturing a more ecologically mindful worldview.\n\nThe core of my talk will present a theory of ethics and a philosophical foundation based on prior research demonstrating that certain types of mindfulness and meditation practices are promoters of pro-environmental behaviors and actions. I will demonstrate how the reverse engineering of biomimetic technology allows us to craft system prompts that offer affordances to leverage wisdom gained through experience from the embedding space. By identifying how these affordances promote sustainability-oriented education for collective wellbeing, we can bypass the traditional \"elite college -> elite consulting group -> green non-profit\" pipeline.\n\nTo provide practical insights, I will discuss strategies that are currently under research and implementation, with results ready to present by October. These strategies include the development and implementation of white papers and recommendations for modifying the reinforcement learning components of LLMs. The goal is to create interfaces that incorporate affordances designed to promote metacognition, goal reappraisal, and ultimately foster an inner revolution conducive to a greener world.\n\nThis presentation will not only offer a conceptual framework but will also showcase practical applications and strategies that have been implemented at scale. Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of how to harness LLMs to support self-paced foundational skill acquisition, facilitate inquiry-based learning, and promote ecological consciousness among learners.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe objective of this presentation is to share best practices and innovative approaches for integrating AI and LLMs into educational systems to foster metacognition, goal reappraisal, and ecological mindfulness. By highlighting practical implementations and providing actionable recommendations, this talk aims to inspire educators, policy-makers, and digital education leaders to adopt and scale these practices in their own contexts, contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive future.\n\nThis version integrates the emphasis on specific types of mindfulness and meditation practices and keeps the proposal aligned with UNESCO's goals for Digital Learning Week 2024.\nGATSMARULLM? is the acronym where's the cool name with an acronym - also can you make it 300 words max\n\nChatGPT\nCertainly!

He once drew someone in 30 seconds and tried to sell the drawing for a high price. When questioned about it, he said, \"It took me my entire life to make it.\" \n\nThis story inspires my questions about work, effort, and value. The problem isn't that the machines wrote the blog post quickly; the issue is it includes nothing of 𝘺𝘰𝘶 in it. So my question is: what is \"you,\" and how can it be brought into the work we build together with AI?\n\n💬 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐰𝐞 𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐀𝐈 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐮𝐬 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐝?\nThis got me thinking about generative AI tools for images, like MidJourney, which creates images on a pixel level, not a brush level, not a camera lens level; it's a 16-bit unit without meaning. A letter makes a sound, a sound has meaning - a pixel is arbitrary. \n\nThis is the difference between image and text generation; the fundamental unit differs. Large Language Models like chatGPT seem to follow biomimetic principles, thus mapping to human cognition more closely and allowing a mutual exchange of intelligence—not so with the black box of midjourney.\n\n𝘏𝘰𝘸 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘪𝘵 𝘣𝘦 𝘥𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴? \nI think it has to be taken down to the atomic element, the pen stroke (pressure, angle, speed, smoothness...) and drawing styles.\n\n🖌 𝐀𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭'𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐰𝐚𝐲.𝐀𝐈 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧. \nI've been building it to explore whether we can create artificial craftsmanship.

Here's a reformulated proposal focusing on the specified themes, incorporating relevant content and ensuring applicability to the UNESCO call for proposals:\n\n---\n\n**Title: ECO Learn: Enhancing AI Competencies and Integrity in Education**\n\n**Narrative Description:**\n\nIn \"ECO Learn: Enhancing AI Competencies and Integrity in Education,\" I will present a comprehensive approach to integrating AI in education with a focus on metacognition, ethical use, and sustainable practices. This proposal aligns with the themes of national or institutional AI competency frameworks, addressing challenges posed by AI, and innovative methodologies for training teachers.\n\nDrawing from my extensive experience in educational technology, I will explore the development of AI competency frameworks for students and educators. These frameworks are designed to ensure that learners are equipped with the necessary skills to navigate and utilize AI responsibly. I will showcase best practices from various institutions where these frameworks have been implemented at scale, highlighting their impact on both student outcomes and institutional integrity.\n\nOne key area of focus will be strategies to address the challenges generative AI poses to academic integrity and learning assessment. I will discuss innovative solutions, such as AI-driven tools for plagiarism detection and the creation of unique, individualized assessments that are less susceptible to AI manipulation.

Here's a revised version of the proposal without the green focus:\n\n---\n\n**Title: ECO Learn: Enhancing AI Competencies and Integrity in Education**\n\n**Narrative Description:**\n\nIn \"ECO Learn: Enhancing AI Competencies and Integrity in Education,\" I will present a comprehensive approach to integrating AI in education with a focus on metacognition, ethical use, and sustainable practices. This proposal aligns with the themes of national or institutional AI competency frameworks, addressing challenges posed by AI, and innovative methodologies for training teachers.\n\nDrawing from my extensive experience in educational technology, I will explore the development of AI competency frameworks for students and educators. These frameworks are designed to ensure that learners are equipped with the necessary skills to navigate and utilize AI responsibly. I will showcase best practices from various institutions where these frameworks have been implemented at scale, highlighting their impact on both student outcomes and institutional integrity.\n\nOne key area of focus will be strategies to address the challenges generative AI poses to academic integrity and learning assessment. I will discuss innovative solutions, such as AI-driven tools for plagiarism detection and the creation of unique, individualized assessments that are less susceptible to AI manipulation. These strategies not only uphold academic standards but also promote a deeper understanding and ethical use of AI among students.\n\nIn addition, I will present methodologies for training and assessing teachers' AI competencies. This includes the design and implementation of training programs and guidelines tested to support teaching and research staff in developing their AI skills. By incorporating elements of metacognition and goal reappraisal, these programs aim to foster a reflective and proactive approach to AI integration in the classroom.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe objective of this presentation is to share best practices and innovative approaches for integrating AI into educational systems to enhance metacognition, ethical use, and sustainability.
