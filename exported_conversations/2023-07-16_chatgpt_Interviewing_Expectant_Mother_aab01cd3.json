How has the pregnancy journey been for you so far?\n6. What have you learned about yourself since you've become pregnant?\n7. How do you imagine the baby's personality? \n8. What are your biggest fears or concerns about parenthood?\n9. What kind of father do you think I'll be?\n10. How do you see us evolving as a couple after the baby's birth?\n11.

How have your parents influenced your approach to parenting?\n16. If you could give our child one piece of advice for their life, what would it be?\n17.

      "content": "Krista Tippett is known for her insightful and thought-provoking questions. She tends to steer her interviews towards deeper topics, with a focus on spiritual, ethical, and philosophical realms. If Krista were to conduct this interview, she might ask the following:\n\n1. How has the journey of pregnancy shaped your understanding of life and creation?\n2. In the face of becoming a parent, how has your perspective on your own parents and their influence changed?\n3. How does the anticipation of motherhood intersect with your spiritual beliefs or values?\n4. In what ways do you hope to nurture the spirit of our child, in addition to their physical and intellectual growth?\n5. How do you think experiencing the creation of new life from within you has or will change your relationship with yourself?\n6. As we step into parenthood, how do you envision us maintaining our individual identities, along with our shared identity as parents?\n7. What aspects of your past do you hope to imbue in our child's future? And what do you hope they will do differently?\n8. In what ways do you believe our child will teach us about life, love, and the world?\n9. Can you share a transformative experience from your life that you believe will impact your approach to motherhood?\n10. How do you envision the balance of instilling our values in our child, while also giving them the freedom to form their own identity?\n11. As we approach the birth of our child, how are you processing the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability of this journey?\n\nRemember to listen deeply, give her space to think, and allow the conversation to flow organically. Every interview that Krista Tippett conducts is characterized by respect, empathy, and genuine curiosity, and these are traits you would want to emulate.",
