      "content": "Yes, it's generally **okay to use iodized salt** for lacto-fermentation, but it’s **not ideal**. Here's why:\n\n### Why Non-Iodized Salt is Preferred:\n- **Iodine can inhibit bacterial growth**: The iodine in iodized salt may slightly hinder the growth of the lactic acid bacteria that are essential for fermentation. It doesn’t usually *stop* fermentation, but it can slow it down or lead to less consistent results.\n- **Anti-caking agents** in iodized salt can sometimes cause cloudiness or off textures.\n\n### When It’s Fine to Use Iodized Salt:\n- If it’s all you have, especially for small batches or short ferments, it usually won’t ruin your ferment.\n- Many people have successfully fermented with iodized salt, especially in countries where that's the default.\n\n### Best Practice:\n- **Use non-iodized salt** like sea salt, kosher salt, or pickling/canning salt for optimal and predictable results.\n- Look for labels like “no additives” or “pure.”\n\nIf you're doing a test batch or experimenting with what's on hand, go ahead with iodized salt—but for best results, switch to non-iodized in the future.",

      "content": "If you're just **topping up a brine**, using **a bit of iodized salt** in that added water **won’t ruin your ferment**—especially if the original brine is already active and thriving.\n\nHere’s a good rule of thumb:\n\n### If you're topping up:\n- **Use non-iodized salt** if you can—it keeps your microbial environment as healthy as possible.\n- If you **must use iodized salt**, **dilute it well in the water before adding**, and make sure it’s a small amount relative to the total volume. The existing brine culture is usually robust enough to handle minor additions without issue.\n\n### To keep your ferment going strong:\n- **Avoid repeated use** of iodized salt over multiple batches. Over time, iodine might accumulate and cause problems.\n- **Use starter brine from previous successful ferments** to help “inoculate” new batches, even when topping up.\n\nSo go ahead and top up if needed—even with iodized salt in a pinch—but for long-term success and active reuse of brine, switch back to non-iodized salt when possible.",
