      "content": "Short answer: by age 2–3, outcomes depend far more on the **quality of care and family stress/attunement** than on *who* provides it. High-quality center care can nudge language/cognition up a bit; very long hours in lower-quality settings can nudge externalizing behavior up a bit. A warm, responsive parent at home is great for attachment and emotion regulation—but similar benefits show up when a nanny/child-minder is consistently warm and responsive. Effects are generally **small** either way. citeturn1search12turn1search2turn0search4\n\n### What large studies say about 24–36 months\n- **NICHD SECCYD (US, 1,300+ kids, tracked to adolescence):**  \n  • More *hours* in non-parental care → small increases in externalizing/risk-taking;  \n  • **Higher quality** care → better language/academic outcomes and *less* externalizing;  \n  • Attachment security hinges mainly on **parental sensitivity**, not whether care is “non-maternal.” citeturn0search4turn0search20turn0search2  \n- **Center vs home-based/nanny:** Center care tends to produce slightly higher cognitive/language scores by age 3; home-based care sometimes shows fewer behavior problems and higher day-to-day wellbeing—again, quality and caregiver responsiveness dominate. citeturn1search6turn1search2turn1search3  \n- **Entering center care at 2–3 (vs earlier):** Several analyses find the strongest cognitive gains when **entry is between ages 2–3** (not earlier), especially for children who benefit from more stimulation. citeturn1search2turn1search5  \n- **Universal childcare “natural experiments”:** Results vary by quality and rollout speed. Norway’s high-quality expansion (mainly 3–6) shows positive long-run outcomes; Quebec’s rapid low-fee rollout showed higher behavior problems and lower life satisfaction later—often interpreted as a **quality/oversight** caution rather than “childcare is bad.” citeturn2search7turn2search10turn0search1turn0search13\n\n### Attachment & the “stay with mom” question\n- Secure attachment is most strongly predicted by **sensitive, responsive caregiving**. Interventions that improve caregiver sensitivity modestly improve attachment security; the **care setting** is secondary. A nanny or key worker can also become a secure base if consistent. citeturn0search2turn0search14turn0search18\n\n### If you do choose non-parental care at 2–3, “quality” looks like:\n- **Stable relationships** (low turnover), warm, responsive interactions, lots of talk/play;  \n- **Small groups/low ratios** (e.g., ~1:4 for 13–35 months; smaller is better), and limited very long days;  \n- Health/safety and outdoor time. citeturn0search7turn0search11turn1search15\n\n### France-specific note\nFrom **September of the year your child turns 3**, instruction is compulsory in France (usually école maternelle). Ages **2→3 (the third year of life)** are your call; from 3, you’ll need school or an approved alternative. citeturn3search2turn3search6\n\n---\n\n## Practical takeaways for your decision\n1) **Either path can be excellent** for a two-year-old if it preserves:  \n   warm, responsive daily care; reasonable hours; and low family stress. The measurable child-effect sizes are small; **your family’s stress/finances/mental health often matter more**. citeturn1search12  \n2) **If you keep him home:** prioritize language-rich routines, playdates/peers, outdoor play, and your own wellbeing. (The “dose” of high-quality interaction is what matters.) citeturn1search4  \n3) **If you use care:** pick for *people*, not just facilities—observe interactions, ask about ratios/turnover/attachment key-worker, and avoid very long days when possible. citeturn0search7\n\n---\n\n## About using the €50k (crypto) to fund a stay-home year\nFrom a child-outcomes lens, **spending to reduce family stress and enable sensitive, present caregiving is defensible**. If that money lets your wife (or you) be **consistently warm, rested, and responsive**, that’s a win. If instead it creates financial strain later, a **hybrid** (e.g., part-time crèche or a few nanny mornings for rest/work) can balance stimulation, peers, and parental bandwidth—often the sweet spot at this age. citeturn1search2\n\nIf you want, I can help you compare concrete options (full-time at home vs part-time crèche vs nanny-share), using local ratios/costs and your budget so you can see trade-offs clearly.",
