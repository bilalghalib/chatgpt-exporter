      "content": "To make your kubba bulgur casing stick together better, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Flour or Starch**:  \n   - Add a small amount of all-purpose flour or cornstarch to the bulgur mixture. This acts as a binder and helps the casing hold together when shaping and frying.\n\n2. **Semolina**:  \n   - Mixing in semolina with the bulgur provides additional structure and firmness, making it easier to mold.\n\n3. **Egg**:  \n   - Incorporate one beaten egg into the mixture. This is a classic binder that helps everything stick together well.\n\n4. **Potato**:  \n   - Mashed potatoes (either boiled or baked) can act as a natural adhesive. Add a small amount to the bulgur dough for better cohesion.\n\n5. **Fine Bulgur**:  \n   - Ensure you are using fine bulgur rather than coarser varieties. Fine bulgur absorbs water better and creates a more cohesive dough.\n\n6. **Kneading and Hydration**:  \n   - After soaking the bulgur, knead it thoroughly until it becomes pliable. If it’s too dry, add small amounts of water or broth while kneading to achieve the right consistency.\n\n7. **Gluey Ingredients**:  \n   - Add a tablespoon of bread crumbs or even a touch of cooked rice, as their starchy nature can help bind the mixture.\n\n8. **Chill the Mixture**:  \n   - Allow the bulgur casing to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes after preparing it. Chilling can help firm up the mixture.\n\nAdjust the quantities carefully to maintain the balance of flavors and texture. Start with small additions and test by shaping a small piece before proceeding.",
