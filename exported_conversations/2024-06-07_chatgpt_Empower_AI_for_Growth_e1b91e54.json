      "content": "whats a title for this talk\n\nNearly 80% of the population will have a smartphone, and they are rapidly integrating with large language models. What unseen values are baked into the LLMs during training, particularly during Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback(RLHF)? LLMs are designed to give answers rather than inspire thinking, and during our workshops with youth in SWANA, we find an overreliance and trust in LLMs, resulting in poor results and limited learning and development.\nLLMs are designed to deliver results with values baked in at many levels. Our question is how to leverage this novel technology to bring about self-authorship, personal growth, and contribution. In short, how do LLMs help people in their becoming as opposed to helping people in their doing? We believe that one of the greatest tools of accessible education technology to support becoming can be delivered en-mass if only LLMs had different values embedded. \n\nWhat are the current values? What should those values be? Where are our leverage points? \n\nThis workshop will attempt to articulate a starting point for these questions, and will support the formation of a few clusters to begin an answer.\n\n\nDuring the workshop, we will collaborate to learn and discover intervention methods to aid marginalized youth and those with limited learning opportunities. We'll explore three intervention channels to identify different scales and complexity of influence mechanisms.\n\nSimple / minimal impact: \nSystem prompts / LLM interface design. \nWhat system prompts can promote learning and support marginalized youth in their development?\n\nMedium complexity / medium impact: \nOpen Source LLM / Fine Tuning\nWhat methods of fine-tuning are possible? Which opensource tool kits can we use, what are the available datasets, or which datasets can we create with LLMs to fine-tune an LLM to support marginalized youth's development?\n\nMore complex, largest impact:\nHow can the workshop group influence OpenAI, Claude, and Perplexity Gemini to make changes to their RLHF protocols? Can we work together to research and create a white paper on modified RLHF personas and objectives? What should the goals of the LLMs be?\n\n\nWe aim to continue the conversation and encourage those who want to participate in supporting us in writing a white paper on a modified RHLF approach and a policy paper addressing the question of the value embedded in LLMs. \nWe aim to develop a framework for assessing LLMs along the values, becoming vs doing, and developmental axes. \nFinally, we hope to contribute to a GitHub project containing lists of system prompts attempting to prototype the \"mindset\" the LLMs of the future may enhance that make learning and growing accessible to all people with a smartphone.
