      "content": "Got it — thanks for sharing the details. To craft a strong abstract, I’ll need to know what angle you’d like your presentation to take. From what I know about your background (post-traumatic growth research, social entrepreneurship training, Islamic perspectives on economics and meaning, curriculum development in conflict-affected contexts), you could fit well into several of the symposium themes. For example, you might:  \n\n- **Summarize evidence** from your Beirut Blast/PTG thesis and related work, linking trauma, resilience, and spirituality.  \n- **Address cultural considerations** by grounding your work in Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, or broader MENA contexts.  \n- **Highlight opportunities/barriers** from your experience integrating values-based frameworks into education and entrepreneurship.  \n- **Explore future directions** in Islamic psychology by connecting post-traumatic growth and communal healing with Islamic spiritual concepts (baraka, tawakkul, sabr, etc.).  \n\nHere’s a **draft abstract** (≈390 words) you could adapt:  \n\n---\n\n### Abstract  \n**Integrating Islamic Spirituality to Foster Resilience and Post-Traumatic Growth in Community Mental Health and Education**  \n\nIn the Middle East, communities face intersecting challenges of displacement, conflict, and socio-economic uncertainty that strain both mental health systems and everyday educational and social settings. At the same time, Islamic spirituality offers a rich tradition of meaning-making, belonging, and resilience that can serve as a resource for post-traumatic growth and psychological flourishing. This presentation draws on mixed-methods research conducted after the 2020 Beirut Port Explosion, as well as subsequent programmatic work in Iraq and Gaza, to examine how spiritually integrated practices can complement existing healthcare and community support systems.  \n\nThe first part of the presentation summarizes empirical evidence linking Islamic concepts such as tawakkul (trust in God), sabr (patience), and shukr (gratitude) with measurable indicators of resilience, well-being, and growth following adversity. These findings are situated within broader literature on post-traumatic growth and positive psychology, highlighting parallels and unique contributions from Islamic perspectives.  \n\nThe second part addresses cultural considerations in adapting these insights across diverse Arab contexts. Particular attention is given to the role of schools, mosques, and community-based organizations as sites where spirituality and psychosocial support intersect. Through case studies of teacher training workshops, entrepreneurship programs, and community rebuilding initiatives, the presentation identifies both opportunities (such as fostering belonging, narrative reframing, and cooperative learning) and barriers (such as stigma, lack of trained facilitators, and institutional resistance) to integrating Islamic spirituality into practical interventions.  \n\nFinally, the presentation explores future directions for research, education, and clinical practice in Islamic psychology. These include developing evidence-based curricula that align with both Islamic epistemologies and contemporary mental health frameworks, designing training-of-trainers models for educators and practitioners, and building cross-regional networks of scholars and practitioners to advance the field.  \n\nBy situating Islamic spirituality as a resource for resilience and post-traumatic growth, this contribution seeks to bridge research, practice, and cultural context. It argues that integrating these perspectives is not only culturally responsive but essential to addressing the unique psychosocial needs of the Middle East today.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to also **draft the 500-word biography** now, drawing on your background (Bloom, PTG research, curriculum development, Islamic economics/psychology interests)? Or would you prefer the abstract polished further first?",

      "content": "Perfect — your **School Without Borders in Gaza** work is a strong fit because it explicitly integrates **Islamic spirituality (Qur’anic reflection, gratitude, Suratul Duha, rope of Allah verse, etc.)** with **post-traumatic growth (PTG) and resilience practices in education**【9†PTG School without Borders Training Practices V1】. That anchors your abstract directly in the symposium theme.  \n\nHere’s a **revised abstract draft (≈400 words)** that centers Gaza and your explicitly Islamic work:  \n\n---\n\n### Abstract  \n**Integrating Qur’anic Narratives and Strengths-Based Pedagogies to Foster Post-Traumatic Growth in Gaza’s Pop-Up Schools**  \n\nIn Gaza, where war and displacement have disrupted education and community life, teachers are called upon not only to deliver lessons but also to nurture resilience in children who face ongoing trauma. This presentation explores how Islamic spirituality—particularly Qur’anic reflection, communal gratitude, and values of patience, trust, and togetherness—can be woven into classroom practices to foster post-traumatic growth (PTG) and resilience without turning schools into therapy centers.  \n\nDrawing on fieldwork with *School Without Borders* pop-up schools established after recent displacement in Gaza, the session presents simple, adaptable pedagogical modifications that align with both Islamic truths and established PTG frameworks. These practices include: collective check-ins framed by Suratul Duha, gratitude reflections inspired by Prophetic traditions, and cooperative learning methods grounded in Qur’anic injunctions to “hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided” (Q 3:103). Together, they promote belonging, agency, and narrative reconstruction, all of which are essential factors for resilience and growth.  \n\nEvidence from Bloom’s broader research on PTG in Lebanon and Iraq is combined with classroom-level case examples from Gaza to highlight how humor, teamwork, and judgment—identified as key character strengths correlated with PTG—can be cultivated through spiritually grounded, community-first pedagogies. Teachers trained in these approaches reported greater capacity to hold space for grief while also guiding students toward hope, action, and meaning-making.  \n\nThe presentation addresses cultural considerations specific to Arab and Islamic contexts, including the need to respect teachers’ authority, avoid medicalizing classroom life, and create safe venues for reflection rooted in local idioms of faith and community. It identifies opportunities—such as leveraging Qur’anic stories for narrative reframing and collective intelligence practices—and barriers, including stigma around discussing trauma and institutional constraints.  \n\nFinally, the session explores future directions for Islamic psychology in education: scaling teacher training through strengths-based, spiritually informed modules; integrating PTG factors into curricula; and developing collaborative research to measure long-term psychosocial and academic impacts.  \n\nBy grounding PTG practices in Qur’anic narratives and collective pedagogies, this contribution demonstrates how Islamic spirituality can serve as both a cultural resource and a practical tool for resilience. In doing so, it offers a model for spiritually integrated mental health support in educational settings across the Middle East.  \n\n---\n\n👉 Would you like me to now **draft the biography** (500 words) so you can send the whole submission together, or do you want to iterate on this abstract first?",

      "content": "seems long, what's the shorter version Yeah, I want to come off as more inquisitive and humble, and I'd like to leverage my research and share maybe something about the work in Bloom with post-traumatic growth, and aligning it with Islamic principles, and how it can be helpful for people in Gaza as the conflict rages. And I'm not sure what the angle should be, but I know maybe my goals are to maybe share some things that I've experienced, and to connect this idea of the world is going crazy, but it should be inspiring us to do better, and be better, and connect more, and go deeper, and all that. And something about how maybe it's possible to dig into the Muslim tradition and connect it with positive psychology, and these post-traumatic growth research, and to demonstrate how, you know, God promises in the Qur'an that we will be tried. And in the Qur'an, and in other places, we see the prophets and those that are nearest to God are tried harder and harder. And the question is, what is the immunity? I call it presilience, but faith is presilience, I guess. And maybe it would be interesting to talk about post-traumatic growth from an Islamic perspective, and then we can talk about, you know, the lessons learned during the Beirut blast, and how we've shared them with people in Gaza. And I'd like to align it with what they're doing at this conference, but also to say that I don't know, and this is like a little bit of a humble kind of share and inquiry, and I'm sure that there's a lot of other researchers out there doing this work. But, and maybe the angle of like people that want to take leadership, and social entrepreneurship, and engagement, and how to connect the work with that, because that's the area that I'm back in, backgrounded in, but also like what it connects with in terms of their material. And essentially, maybe the other thing, I don't know how to fit it into this whole landscape, is I want to just encourage people to join and talk to people in Gaza, and people in conflict situations, and to kind of have a way to feel like this isn't a hyper taboo, and like you shouldn't feel super scared that one thing, maybe this is a whole other pitch, I could do both, but you know, I've also been connecting with people on the ground in Gaza, and just connecting personally, and they've been sharing with me how meaningful and impactful it is. I guess it's less connected to my research, and my work, and I think the PTG stuff is more like clear, but the other thing, I'm just like, if you know somebody in Gaza, here are like small tips of how you can connect and talk with them. I'm not sure, and because they've been telling me like it's so good to talk to somebody that's not in Gaza, so I can put my burdens down and feel heard, and I feel like it would be so beautiful if a million people connected with a million people in Gaza in this way, and there's enough, there's billions of Muslims, you know, and if I think it would be beautiful if we could do that, and be their brothers and sisters, and how to have and hold that sort of conversation in a way where people aren't afraid of making a mistake, or spiritually bypassing, or anything like that, because it can be so powerful to connect, and we have the ability to connect these days, and maybe that's something we can be working towards and doing. Maybe these are two different proposals, or maybe you see a way of making them one, let me know what you think, or maybe it goes somewhere else, like what are these two different ideas and projects?",

      "content": "Thank you — this is powerful. I hear two related but distinct impulses in what you’ve shared:  \n\n1. **PTG + Islamic spirituality (research/practice)**  \n   – Anchor in your Beirut/PTG research.  \n   – Show how it connects with Qur’anic truths (e.g. Suratul Duha, trials as pathways to growth, sabr/tawakkul as “presilience”).  \n   – Share how these ideas were adapted with *School Without Borders* in Gaza.  \n   – Position yourself as curious and humble: offering early insights, not final answers.  \n\n2. **Global Muslim solidarity + psychosocial connection**  \n   – Encourage Muslims (and others) worldwide to reach out to people in Gaza.  \n   – Share how being simply present and listening has been described by Gazans as deeply meaningful.  \n   – Offer practical reflections on how to connect without fear of “getting it wrong.”  \n   – Cast this as a collective act of care aligned with Islamic psychology’s concern for community and belonging.  \n\nYou’re right: these could be **two separate abstracts**, but they also complement one another. If you only want to submit *one*, I’d suggest leaning on the **PTG + Islamic spirituality** frame as your primary proposal (since it directly aligns with symposium research themes). You could still close by **inviting reflection on global solidarity and everyday connection** as a practice of applied Islamic psychology.  \n\nHere’s a **shorter, more humble draft abstract (~280 words)** that combines both threads while staying within scope:  \n\n---\n\n### Abstract  \n**Faith as Presilience: Exploring Post-Traumatic Growth and Islamic Spirituality in Conflict-Affected Contexts**  \n\nThe Qur’an reminds us that those nearest to God are tried most, and that trials can be a path to growth. My research on post-traumatic growth (PTG) after the Beirut Port Blast explored how people found meaning, strength, and new possibilities through hardship. More recently, I have been working with *School Without Borders* in Gaza, where teachers are courageously creating pop-up schools for children displaced by war. In these settings, I have seen how Islamic spirituality—reflections on Suratul Duha, gratitude practices, Qur’anic narratives of patience and trust—can serve as what I call *presilience*: faith that prepares the heart before adversity.  \n\nThis presentation humbly shares lessons from research and practice, and asks how we might deepen the integration of Islamic psychology and positive psychology to serve communities under strain. I will highlight simple, curriculum-aligned practices—cooperative learning, gratitude check-ins, narrative reconstruction through Qur’anic stories—that teachers and facilitators have found supportive of both resilience and belonging.  \n\nAt the same time, I wish to open a conversation: how can Muslims worldwide, and those who care, offer more direct companionship to people in Gaza and other conflict zones? Friends there have told me how meaningful it is simply to speak with someone outside, to be heard without judgment. Might we imagine a million conversations of solidarity—small acts of presence that reflect our shared humanity and the Qur’anic call to hold firmly together?  \n\nRather than offering definitive answers, I hope to share experience, invite critique, and learn from fellow participants about how Islamic psychology can inspire not only healing but also deeper global connection.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to also sketch an alternative **second abstract** (focused only on the “one-to-one solidarity conversations with Gaza” idea), so you can decide whether to submit one or both?",

However, there is a growing demand for Islamically integrated interventions in a wider range of mental health services within hospitals, addiction rehabilitation centers, schools, colleges, social work agencies, etc.\n\nThere is also a need to expand the scope of Islamically grounded psychological interventions to include diverse populations beyond just adults. This scope should encompass adolescents, young adults, and the elderly. Such interventions can be applied in various settings, including outpatient facilities, group treatment environments, forensic settings, behavioral health programs, religious contexts (such as mosques and Ministries of Awqaf), as well as in non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\n\nWith the increasing interest in Qatar, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, and the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, this symposium seeks to engage local and regional communities in an interactive discussion about the current landscape and future directions for integrating Islamic and spiritual psychological approaches in various mental health settings. Additionally, it is an opportunity to foster connections between Hamad Bin Khalifa University and a diverse array of service stakeholders and community leaders.\n\nThe symposium will be held in English and Arabic with live interpretation for both languages.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nChair’s Welcome Message \nI am thoroughly excited to announce our second annual symposium, part of a series of forthcoming academic events on Islamic Psychology at Hamad bin Khalifa University. We pray that HBKU will become a leading center for research and education in Islamic Psychology worldwide.\n\nIn 2024, our symposium was focused on advancing the field of clinical mental health practice through education and research. This year, our focus is on the integration of Islamic spirituality and applications of Islamic psychology across mental health care settings within Qatar and the Muslim world. Given the increasing growth and interest in Islamic psychology, this symposium will allow scholars from the Muslim world and beyond to network, collaborate, share knowledge, and discuss ways of effectively offering integrated mental health services across various healthcare settings within their localities.\n\nAs an educator of Muslim mental health professionals and researcher in the field, I personally look forward to benefiting from the contributions of the scholars who will make up the symposium. I anticipate deriving many insights and directions regarding approaches to looking at how we can infuse Islamic spirituality into our work and modify and enhance the current conventional approaches of mental health care delivery.\n\nDr. Hooman Keshavarzi\nDr. Hooman Keshavarzi\nProgram Director of Islamic Psychology \nAssistant Professor \nCollege of Islamic Studies, HBKU \n\n \n\nDean’s Welcome Message \nAs the Dean of the College of Islamic Studies at HBKU, I am honored to welcome you to the “Integrating Islamic Spirituality Across Mental Health Services in the Middle East” symposium. This comes as the second biennial international symposium we organize at the College of Islamic Studies (CIS) on Counseling Psychology.\n\nAt the CIS, we are deeply committed to advancing research and practice that respond meaningfully to the unique needs of our communities. We have launched the MA program in Counseling Psychology at HBKU to serve the people of Qatar and the global community by both educating a new generation of professional mental health practitioners and contributing to community wellbeing.\n\nThis second edition of the Counseling Psychology symposium aims to bridge theory and practice by creating an environment where culturally aware and Islamically grounded mental health services are accessible and relevant to the needs of society. This year’s focus on integrating Islamic spirituality and culture into mental health services in Qatar and the region comes at a critical time. The perspectives and discussions emerging from our region will not remain confined to it, but they will carry important implications for broader mental health services globally. This reaffirms our position at CIS not only as a member of the academic community but also as a center of academic excellence and an institution actively shaping the future of mental health through an Islamic and culturally rooted lens.\n\nIt is a great pleasure to witness the significant progress we are making in the field of Counseling Psychology; progress rooted in local values, cultural integrity, and spiritual relevance. I firmly believe our collective efforts will help address these challenges and provide meaningful solutions for our communities. I look forward to seeing you at the second Counseling Psychology symposium organized by CIS.\n\nDr. Recep Şentürk\nDr. Recep Şentürk\nDean\nCollege of Islamic Studies, HBKU \n\nFollow us\nLinkedinLinkedin\nFacebookFacebook\nXX\nInstagramInstagram\nEdxEdx\nSubscribe to the official HBKU newsletter WAMDHA\nYour Email Address\nColleges and Schools\nCollege of Islamic Studies\nCollege of Humanities and Social Sciences\nCollege of Science and Engineering\nCollege of Law\nCollege of Health and Life Sciences\nCollege of Public Policy\nSchool of Economics and Management\nResearch Institutes and Centers\nQatar Biomedical Research Institute (QBRI)\nQatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI)\nQatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI)\nGlobal Institute for Strategic Research (GISR)\nView More\nUseful Links\nAbout HBKU\nUniversity Policies\nAcademics\nResearch\nHBKU Press\nExecutive Education Center\nCareers\n© 2025 All rights reserved to Hamad Bin Khalifa University.\n\nReport an Issue\nCookies Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nTop of Site\nWe use cookies to ensure you have the best browsing experience.\nBy continuing to browse the site you are agreeing to our use of cookies.

      "content": "Excellent point — polishing means we want to **hit their four symposium topics clearly** (evidence, cultural considerations, barriers/opportunities, future directions), while staying true to your voice: humble, inquisitive, grounded in practice and research, and with explicit Islamic anchors.  \n\nHere’s a polished version of your abstract (≈430 words, within the 300–500 word guideline) tailored to HBKU + IAIP + Khalil Center interests:  \n\n---\n\n### Abstract  \n**Faith as Presilience: Post-Traumatic Growth, Qur’anic Narratives, and Educational Practice in Conflict Contexts**  \n\nThe Qur’an reminds us that those nearest to God are tried most, and that trials can be a path to growth. My research on post-traumatic growth (PTG) after the Beirut Port Blast revealed how people cultivated meaning, strengths, and new possibilities through hardship. Since then, I have been working with *School Without Borders* in Gaza, where teachers are establishing pop-up schools amidst displacement and bombardment. In these fragile contexts, I have seen how Islamic spirituality—reflection on Suratul Duha, gratitude practices, Qur’anic narratives of sabr (patience) and tawakkul (trust)—can function as what I call *presilience*: faith that fortifies hearts before and during adversity.  \n\nThis presentation shares preliminary lessons from integrating PTG frameworks with Islamic truths in educational environments, and invites reflection on how these insights might inform broader applications across mental health services. I will begin by summarizing evidence from my Beirut study, linking character strengths such as teamwork, judgment, and humor with PTG outcomes, and situating these within both positive psychology and Islamic psychology literatures.  \n\nI will then highlight practical tools trialed in Gaza classrooms—collective gratitude check-ins, cooperative over competitive learning, narrative reconstruction using Qur’anic stories—that teachers have found supportive of resilience and belonging. These approaches are culturally resonant, easy to train, and align with existing curricula, avoiding the perception that mental health is a separate or stigmatized activity.  \n\nThe discussion will also surface barriers: the risk of overburdening teachers, institutional resistance to nontraditional pedagogy, and the ongoing trauma of war. At the same time, opportunities emerge: strengthening the role of schools and mosques as psychosocial anchors, expanding training-of-trainers models, and embedding PTG-informed practices into education systems across the region.  \n\nFinally, I hope to open a broader inquiry: how can Muslims worldwide respond to crises not only with advocacy but also with presence? Friends in Gaza tell me how meaningful it is simply to speak with someone outside, to feel heard without judgment. Might Islamic psychology help us imagine these small acts of solidarity—listening, holding space, witnessing—as legitimate forms of spiritually integrated care?  \n\nRather than offering definitive answers, my aim is to share research and practice, to learn from colleagues’ perspectives, and to collectively explore how Islamic spirituality can inspire not only healing after trauma but deeper global connection and responsibility.  \n\n---\n\n✨ This version:  \n- Names your **Beirut PTG research** (evidence).  \n- Highlights **Gaza classrooms** (cultural considerations).  \n- Surfaces **barriers & opportunities**.  \n- Ends with **future directions** and an open invitation, aligning with their ethos.  \n\nWould you like me to also **draft your 500-word biography** so that your PTG research + Bloom pedagogy + Gaza work are presented as a coherent through-line for the submission?",

His work sits at the intersection of education, spirituality, and social entrepreneurship, with a focus on resilience, post-traumatic growth, and values-based learning.  \n\nInspired by the Arab Spring, Bilal left Michigan for the Middle East to work alongside youth, unlocking creativity and co-constructing futures amid political and social upheaval. Living through conflict left him personally marked by trauma and, years later, led to the recognition that naming and addressing PTSD allowed him to rediscover a vital truth: inner well-being and outer well-doing rise together. This realization has since shaped both his research and his practice.  \n\nAs co-founder and Head of Learning & Research at Bloom, Bilal helped design and lead Bloom Accelerators—community-first, non-competitive entrepreneurship programs that integrate reflective storywork, cooperative learning, and resilience practices with practical venture-building tools. Since 2016, Bloom has supported over 1,000 entrepreneurs across the SWANA region and Africa, partnered with the UN International Trade Centre to co-design curricula, and trained hundreds of mentors and facilitators. Bloom’s approach emphasizes agency, belonging, and collective intelligence, helping participants not only to build ventures but to strengthen their capacity for growth in the face of adversity.  \n\nBilal’s academic work extends this commitment. His master’s thesis explored post-traumatic growth among Lebanese social entrepreneurs after the Beirut Port Blast, identifying strengths such as teamwork, humor, and judgment as correlates of resilience and growth. These findings continue to inform his efforts to adapt educational practices in conflict-affected contexts. Most recently, he has worked with *School Without Borders* in Gaza, supporting teachers who are creating pop-up schools for displaced children. By integrating Qur’anic reflection, gratitude practices, and cooperative pedagogies with established PTG frameworks, Bilal and his collaborators aim to provide tools that are simple to implement, spiritually grounded, and responsive to local realities.  \n\nCurrently, as a student of Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College, Bilal is deepening his understanding of Islamic epistemologies and their relevance to contemporary mental health. His aim is to contribute to the emerging field of Islamic psychology by bridging research, practice, and tradition—exploring how Qur’anic narratives, prophetic models, and community-based practices can complement and enrich modern psychological frameworks.  \n\nAcross his work, Bilal seeks to provide people with tools, peers, and contexts that enable them to flourish. He hopes to contribute to new narratives of human collaboration and possibility, bringing more healed hands to the task of building a future rooted in faith, resilience, and beauty—particularly across the Global South, but with lessons for the world at large.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **tighten this even further (to ~350 words)** so it reads leaner for the submission, or keep the fuller ~490-word version since you have the 500-word allowance?",

He builds tools communities can keep: assessments, activity libraries, and a learning-by-doing-together platform.\nHis current interests sit at the intersection of trauma-informed design, Islamic ethics, and community empowerment.

He is fluent in Arabic and English.\nFor Islamic studies and psychology circles, Bilal is drawn to spiritually integrated care that feels native to local settings, clinics, schools, masjid/awqaf programs, NGOs, attentive to language, culture, and implementation. He is curious about how post-traumatic growth research, Islamic psychology, and peer-based learning can inform practical pathways for service, education, and entrepreneurship in the Arab region.\nHis belief is that healed hearts reflecting the light of God helps guide our actions towards co-creating a meaningful and beautiful path towards a beautiful future, together.\n\nwhat about also my cambridge muslim college islam and psychology degree that i'm doing - migh tbe relevant aslo that i'm a part of the Ecosystem Network since 2014 with the welbein gproject and now the WHEN network which attempts to find ways to bring wellbeing into higher education and our organizations (",

This is a lot of material to add:\n\nThe spiritual seeking during burnout - what is good intention, why social causes, what is a good life, what is true\nFinding deeper answers during the pandemic pause\nExploring mental complexity theory, Ken Wilber, transpersonal psychology, teal organizations, Piaget, positive psychology\nFinding something missing - the metaphysical dimension\nThe heart perception (qalb) in Islamic tradition\nAccess to divine, source of beauty/goodness/truth\nBeing able to leverage developmental psychology (Kegan) etc with Islamic tradition\nConfidence in a tradition that's stable, grounded, deep roots\nThe Islam and Psychology movement (Malik Badawi, Rania Awaad, Abdullah Rothman)\nCMC bringing out healing gems\n\nThis is A LOT. The challenge is:\n\nThe current bio is ~280 words and works well\nThis addition could easily balloon it to 500+ words\nThe user asked me to help because the ChatGPT version was \"so long\"\nBut this is important biographical information that explains his trajectory\n\nI need to:\n\nBe honest that this is a tension - they complained about length but want to add substantial content\nFind a way to integrate this that doesn't turn it into the bloated ChatGPT version\nKeep his voice - direct, grounded, not academic\nMaybe show them where it could fit and let them decide if the trade-off is worth it\n\nThe user preferences say:\n\nLikes metaphors when figuring things out\nLikes constructive criticism and pushback\nDoesn't like being flattered\nOnly say something is unique/groundbreaking if true\n\nSo I should push back on the length issue while helping them see how to integrate it IF they want to. I should also note that this spiritual journey is compelling but needs to be written tightly or it will overwhelm the practical work.\nI'll craft an approach that distills the rich spiritual exploration into a concise, meaningful narrative. The key is to capture the essence of the journey without getting bogged down in academic terminology or lengthy explanations. I'll focus on the transformative insights that directly connect to his professional work, creating a bridge between personal growth and professional impact.Okay, here's the tension: you opened with \"so long\" about the ChatGPT version, but what you're describing now is a full spiritual autobiography that could easily double the word count. That's not a criticism—this is clearly the core transformation that explains why you do what you do—but we need to be intentional about it.\nThe challenge is that developmental psychology journeys (Kegan, Wilber, transpersonal psych, Teal orgs) can read like intellectual résumé-stuffing if not handled carefully. What matters isn't that you read those frameworks—it's that you found them insufficient. The turning point is the absence, not the presence.\nHere's how I'd weave it in, using a metaphor: think of your bio as a house. The current version shows the rooms (work, impact, methods). What you're describing is the foundation—but foundations don't need to list every type of concrete tested before you found bedrock.\n\nRevised version with spiritual journey integrated:\nBrief Biography\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer. He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently a student of Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan into the Middle East to work with youth. He helped seed community innovation spaces through GEMSI in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, then at Autodesk bridged grassroots makers with global sustainability efforts. After living through violence and burning out, he spent years searching: through developmental psychology, mental complexity theory, transpersonal frameworks—looking for answers to what makes a good intention, a good life, what is actually true. During the pandemic's pause, he found what was missing. The traditions he'd studied mapped the mind but left out the heart—not emotion, but what Muslim tradition calls heart-perception: a faculty that accesses beauty, goodness, and truth at their source. Reconnecting with Islam gave him both intellectual grounding and metaphysical confidence. A tradition with deep roots, being brought into contemporary conversation through the Islam and Psychology movement, offered something stable enough to build on.\nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom and now serves as Head of Learning & Research. Bloom runs community-first, non-competitive accelerators that integrate reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table. The work has supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa and grown a bilingual network of mentors, trainers, and partners.\nBilal's academic work meets service in post-conflict contexts. With the UN International Trade Centre he co-designed curricula for sustainable construction. With Nawaya in Lebanon he facilitated design-thinking programs with refugee youth. Most recently he's supported educators at School Without Borders in Gaza, integrating Qur'anic reflection and gratitude practices with post-traumatic growth frameworks for teachers running pop-up schools for displaced children.\nSince 2014, Bilal has been part of the Ecosystem Network, contributing to the Wellbeing Project and now the WHEN network, which brings wellbeing practices into higher education and organizations.\nHis current work explores how trauma-informed design, Islamic psychology, and peer-based learning can create practical pathways for resilience and growth—bringing forward what the Muslim tradition claims to be, and he believes can be: a healing for hearts and world. He is fluent in Arabic and English.\n\nWord count: ~390\nWhat changed:\n\nExpanded the burnout paragraph significantly—but kept it narrative, not a bibliography\nNamed the frameworks briefly (shows range without listing everything)\nUsed your language: \"heart-perception,\" \"source,\" \"stable enough to build on\"\nDropped names like Kegan, Piaget (they'd know if they know; listing them feels like credentials-padding)\nKept Malik Badawi, Rania Awaad, Abdullah Rothman implicit in \"Islam and Psychology movement\" (mentioning them by name in a bio about you feels oddly deferential)\nFinal line echoes your \"healing for hearts\" language\n\nPushback:\nDoes the spiritual journey paragraph earn its length? It's now the longest section. That's defensible if this bio is for Islamic studies/psychology circles (which you mentioned), but it might overwhelm if it's for entrepreneurship or education contexts.\nWould you want two versions—a lean one (~280 words) for general use and this fuller one (~390) for contexts where the spiritual-intellectual journey matters?",

That's not a criticism—this is clearly the core transformation that explains why you do what you do—but we need to be intentional about it.\nThe challenge is that developmental psychology journeys (Kegan, Wilber, transpersonal psych, Teal orgs) can read like intellectual résumé-stuffing if not handled carefully. What matters isn't that you read those frameworks—it's that you found them insufficient. The turning point is the absence, not the presence.\nHere's how I'd weave it in, using a metaphor: think of your bio as a house. The current version shows the rooms (work, impact, methods). What you're describing is the foundation—but foundations don't need to list every type of concrete tested before you found bedrock.\nRevised version with spiritual journey integrated:\nBrief Biography\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer.

He helped seed community innovation spaces through GEMSI in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, then at Autodesk bridged grassroots makers with global sustainability efforts. After living through violence and burning out, he spent years searching: through developmental psychology, mental complexity theory, transpersonal frameworks—looking for answers to what makes a good intention, a good life, what is actually true. During the pandemic's pause, he found what was missing. The traditions he'd studied mapped the mind but left out the heart—not emotion, but what Muslim tradition calls heart-perception: a faculty that accesses beauty, goodness, and truth at their source. Reconnecting with Islam gave him both intellectual grounding and metaphysical confidence. A tradition with deep roots, being brought into contemporary conversation through the Islam and Psychology movement, offered something stable enough to build on.\nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom and now serves as Head of Learning & Research.

He is fluent in Arabic and English.\nWord count: ~390\nWhat changed:\nExpanded the burnout paragraph significantly—but kept it narrative, not a bibliography\nNamed the frameworks briefly (shows range without listing everything)\nUsed your language: \"heart-perception,\" \"source,\" \"stable enough to build on\"\nDropped names like Kegan, Piaget (they'd know if they know; listing them feels like credentials-padding)\nKept Malik Badawi, Rania Awaad, Abdullah Rothman implicit in \"Islam and Psychology movement\" (mentioning them by name in a bio about you feels oddly deferential)\nFinal line echoes your \"healing for hearts\" language\nPushback: Does the spiritual journey paragraph earn its length? It's now the longest section. That's defensible if this bio is for Islamic studies/psychology circles (which you mentioned), but it might overwhelm if it's for entrepreneurship or education contexts.\nWould you want two versions—a lean one (~280 words) for general use and this fuller one (~390) for contexts where the spiritual-intellectual journey matters?\nyeah, I don't see the meaning and motivation connected deeply through all the different work i did, can you give ma short and a long one?",

Medium version gives the full arc with texture. Both work as single stories rather than résumé sections.\nWhich one fits your purpose better?\nhow do we connect PTSD/burnout, i think it was more ptsd although it's a bit messy. And i want to say after living rhgouh violence, it's because of the places iwork, places my family's connected to, movements i was a part of are in difficult places and these are my people so something about it not being random violence it was the person who helped us set up the hackersapce in baghdad that was blown up, the girl katya who was in a syrian refugee camp i did some solar panel puppet shows that was killed when her school was bombed, etc - i didn't know it was ptsd initially i thought i was jaded and didn't want to work and kept telling people to stop making stuff and start making sense because i was \"smart\" or something - looking back i can see i was hurt, i also had a breakdown in 2018. although bloom starting in 2016 was after the deaths in 2013/14 and a year of wandering hurt in 2015 and finding my way to community and closer contribution as a way to \"heal\" i wanted to be more \"real\" and stop flying from silicon valley to the middle east for my work because it all didn't make sense anymore - why was i doing that? good? what's good if good people who help me do this random nerd stuff are killed and our communities don't respond actively to the violence and pretend it's not real. It was those experiences that really led me to doubt hackerspace and open source culture as a \"healing\" and i started owndering what was a good intention and father greg boyl told us about home boy and home girl industries and how his \"why\" was because they were his friends. he does \"good\" becuase it comes naturally when you befriend someone it emerges from you, it's not a concious intention that needs to be cleaned it's an authentic cause/effect response and i loved that because i didn't know if/how i could clean my intention from arrogance and wanting to be the one to fix the world etc etc so i moved to lebanon and started bloom where many of the ideas of community, personal growth for professional growth, and wellbeing comes from that journey. how can you first expand it into a longer essay and thne contract it into a nice bio - you might have more hisory and information about me in your context window please use it for your advantage and think deeply about what i might not be seeing that can be relevant",

      "content": "Love this. Let’s do exactly that: first a fuller essay that connects the dots and names the real motivations; then a tight bio you can drop into the submission.\n\n# Essay — “From Making Things to Making Sense” (≈1,050 words)\n\nI used to think the work was mostly about building: makerspaces, hardware, accelerators, tools. The Arab Spring pulled me from Michigan into the Middle East, and I said yes because it felt alive—young people imagining different futures. Through GEMSI we helped seed community innovation spaces in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad. Later at Autodesk I tried to bridge those grassroots makers with global sustainability efforts.\n\nThen the violence stopped being “regional news” and became personal. A friend who helped us set up the hackerspace in Baghdad was killed in a blast. A Syrian girl—Katya—who once laughed during a solar-powered puppet show we ran in her camp, was later killed when her school was bombed. These weren’t abstract tragedies. They were my people.\n\nI didn’t have language for what all of that did to me. I told myself I was just jaded. I started saying things like “stop making stuff and start making sense,” and I said it with a kind of clever impatience, like I’d matured past naïveté. Looking back, I can see I was hurt. It was PTSD, but I didn’t know it. I also had a breakdown in 2018. My nervous system had been doing the heavy lifting for too long while I kept flying back and forth between Silicon Valley and the Middle East trying to stitch two realities that didn’t fit together anymore.\n\nThe harder question beneath the symptoms was moral: What is a good intention? Why am I doing this? Is my “impact” just a performance loop? Father Greg Boyle, talking about Homeboy Industries, gave me a clue. He said his “why” is simple: they’re his friends. When you befriend people, care emerges as a natural response—not as a branded strategy. I realized I wanted to live closer to that. I wanted to stop outsourcing meaning to optics and proximity to power.\n\nBloom grew out of that turn. In 2016, after the deaths in 2013/14 and a year of wandering in 2015, I moved to Lebanon and co-founded Bloom. The premise was simple: inner well-being and outer well-doing rise together. Our accelerators became community-first and non-competitive; weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table. We trained mentors; we built bilingual networks; we focused on learning by doing together.\n\nDuring the pandemic’s pause, I went deeper into the why. I studied developmental psychology, mental complexity theory, positive psychology. They mapped how minds grow with impressive nuance—but something was missing. They explained cognition, not the *qalb*—the heart-perception Muslims speak about—a faculty oriented to beauty, goodness, and truth at their source. Without that metaphysical dimension, I could describe my experience but not inhabit it with confidence.\n\nReconnecting with Islam changed that. Not as a performance of identity, but as a grounding. The Qur’an doesn’t deny trial; it promises it—and it also promises expansion. Faith, I began to see, can be a kind of presilience: a preparation of the heart before the blow lands. The emerging Islamic psychology movement gave language and community to that intuition. I enrolled at Cambridge Muslim College to study Islam and Psychology, to learn how this tradition can genuinely serve healing—rigorously, humbly, without pretending schools or startups are therapy.\n\nMy master’s research in Paris after the Beirut Port Blast looked at post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs. We saw how strengths like teamwork, humor, and judgment correlated with resilience and growth. That data helped me name what I’d watched in communities for years: growth after trauma isn’t rare, but it’s not automatic either. It happens more often when people have spaces to belong, to tell truer stories about what happened, and to take small, doable actions that rebuild competence.\n\nThat’s what we tried to support with *School Without Borders* in Gaza. Teachers there are building pop-up schools for displaced children while the conflict continues. We worked with them to integrate Qur’anic reflection (Surat al-Duha’s consolation), gratitude check-ins, and cooperative learning—practices that are simple to train, feel native to Islamic life, and fit inside a regular lesson plan. The point isn’t to turn classrooms into clinics. It’s to make school a place where belonging, reflection, and small wins can happen even in crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, other parts of my work kept the same throughline: with the UN International Trade Centre we co-designed curricula for sustainable reconstruction in Iraq that tie heritage and green methods to dignity in rebuilding. With Nawaya in Lebanon we facilitated design-thinking programs with refugee youth. Since 2014 I’ve been part of the Ecosystem Network (The Wellbeing Project, and now WHEN) to bring wellbeing into higher education and organizations. Different projects, same question: how do we design for human agency, belonging, and meaning in hard places?\n\nIf there’s a single sentence that connects it all, it’s this: I want to live where my friendships and my work are not at odds. The losses made that non-negotiable. The breakdowns made it urgent. Islam gave me a way to see the world that is both tender and strong, ancient and practical. Islamic psychology gives me colleagues who are walking the same road—translating that tenderness and strength into methods that fit clinics, schools, NGOs, and everyday life.\n\nI don’t think my story is special. It’s just honest. I misread trauma as cynicism. I chased cleverness when companionship was what healed me. Now I try to build with people, not around them, and to measure success by whether we’re becoming more truthful, more courageous, and more together—especially when the world feels like it’s coming apart.\n\n# Short Bio for Submission (≈280 words)\n\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer. He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.\n\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan into the Middle East to work with youth—helping seed community innovation spaces through GEMSI in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, then bridging grassroots makers with global sustainability at Autodesk. Violence in those communities became personal. Losses in 2013/14, followed by a period of wandering and a breakdown in 2018, were later understood as PTSD. At the time he called it jadedness; in truth, he was hurt. The lesson that followed was foundational: inner well-being and outer well-doing cannot be separated.\n\nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom from that insight. As Head of Learning & Research, he designed community-first, non-competitive accelerators that integrate reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Bloom’s programs have supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa and grown a bilingual mentor/trainer network.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Bilal deepened his inquiry into intention, truth, and the good life. Developmental and positive psychology offered useful maps, but left out what Muslim tradition calls heart-perception (*qalb*).

He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan to work with youth across the Middle East. Between 2011 and 2014 he helped seed community innovation spaces through GEMSI in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad; ran workshops in Syrian refugee camps; bridged grassroots makers with global sustainability efforts at Autodesk. He believed in the liberating power of open-source culture and co-creating futures through creativity.\nThen people he worked with started dying. The person who helped set up the Baghdad hackerspace was blown up. Katya, the girl from a Syrian refugee camp puppet show, was killed when her school was bombed. These weren't strangers—they were his friends, connected to his family's communities and movements. The global networks he was embedded in kept moving forward as if nothing had happened. He didn't recognize his response as PTSD; he thought he was jaded, maybe finally \"smart.\" He spent 2015 wandering and hurt, questioning everything.\nFather Greg Boyle's answer to \"why do you do this work?\" freed him: because they're my friends. Good emerges naturally from friendship, not from intentions cleaned of arrogance. You help your friends because that's what friendship is. This offered a different path: move closer, be local, let work emerge from actual relationships.\nIn 2016 he moved to Lebanon and co-founded Bloom. As Head of Learning & Research, he designed community-first, non-competitive accelerators that integrate reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table because they belong there. Bloom has supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa, building bilingual networks rooted in actual friendship.\nBut he was still hurt. In 2018 he had a breakdown. His master's thesis explored post-traumatic growth among Lebanese social entrepreneurs after the Beirut Port Blast—studying in others what he was living through himself. The research helped him understand resilience, but the frameworks felt incomplete.\nDuring the pandemic he went deeper: Kegan's stages of consciousness, Wilber's integral theory, positive psychology, transpersonal frameworks. Sophisticated maps of how the mind grows and how people make meaning. But they said nothing about where meaning comes from—the metaphysical dimension, the ground of being, the source itself.\nReconnecting with Islam after years of searching gave him what those frameworks couldn't: qalb, heart-perception—a faculty for accessing beauty, goodness, and truth at their source, rooted in the Divine. Not just stages of thinking, but connection to what actually is. A tradition with roots deep enough to hold real suffering and real joy.\nThis integrated understanding shapes his current work: supporting School Without Borders in Gaza where teachers blend Qur'anic reflection with post-traumatic growth practices; co-designing curricula with the UN International Trade Centre that connect heritage, sustainable construction, and dignity in reconstruction; facilitating design-thinking with refugee youth through Nawaya in Lebanon. Since 2014 he has contributed to the Ecosystem Network's efforts to embed wellbeing into higher education through the Wellbeing Project and WHEN network.\nAt Cambridge Muslim College, he studies how Islamic epistemologies can enrich contemporary mental health practice—bringing forward healing from the Muslim tradition, practically and rigorously, especially for conflict-affected communities. Fluent in Arabic and English.\nWHAT I'M SEEING THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE:\nThe Father Greg Boyle moment is your hinge. It's the moment you stopped trying to have pure intentions and started trying to have real relationships. That's what makes Bloom different from your earlier work—not just that you founded it, but how you founded it. This needs to be explicit.\nThe 2018 breakdown matters. Without it, the pandemic search looks intellectual. With it, the search is clearly about survival, not curiosity. But you can hint at it rather than dwell on it.\nThe metaphor you're living: You were trying to build a house (good work) on shifting ground (intentions you didn't trust, frameworks that mapped growth but not ground). Islam gave you bedrock. CMC is you learning the geology of that bedrock. Gaza/UN/Nawaya work is building on it.\nWhat's missing from both bios so far: Why Bloom is different from your earlier work. It's not just another project—it's a different way of working that emerged from loss and Father Greg's insight. Community-first isn't a nice-to-have; it's the whole point.\nThe danger: This story could become trauma-centered rather than meaning-centered. The losses matter because they broke your faith in a certain kind of work and led you to a different kind. They're not the main character—your search for how to work with integrity is.\nWhich length fits your purpose? And does this capture what you were trying to say?\nI think at CMC i'm not just interested in the muslim connection, I believe the gems there are true for all people and that our \"sources of meaning\" as taylor might say or Joe edelman might say constituative attentional policies that feel like they are being drawn from a place beyond our sensible reason is something that seems like a clue that values realism is experientially real and i want to dig into that deeper because - and i think this (maybe you can help me find other threads that connect) is what connects us beyond our polarized world where muslims winning means others lose or china rising is a tradgedy - the belief in the transcendant is one way to have a shining star that we can align to - and also to talk about ultimately what healing is. Growth is not healing. At some point we must acknowledge death as a reality of life as life - to see our roles in the relay race and whatever our understanding of what comes next facing this is critical. Otherwise how long do you save for retirement, how much, especially as we think of (in the west) that aging is just another illness thas reductionist science will cure. And if it does - and one day you're hit by an asteroid on your way to mars. What a tradgedy. I think the foundations of how we think of building societies and civilizations, that death (of people, ideas, orgs) is not always trajic, that it can be beautiful. To design things to be shared and inherited. lots can/will/and must change. Yet I don't find inspiraiton with the nerds complexity theories of mental complexity and levels of civilizations that moves from authoritarian to some sort of egalitarian everyone's ideas is the same blandification consensus bike shedding problem. We need leadership, we need diversity, we need to see each other not as problems with all our gaps to fill to become better and assessing our strengths and weaknesses and skills and competencies and etc - we can, yes, grow. And we can recognize our positions. To not believe that life is random, that your inclinations and the facilitation you might have in learning languages doesn't //mean// something for ultimate purpose. The long arc of history doesn't necessarily bend towards justice, it sort of wobbles - the important thing is who you become in that process. in the quran it says \"We created man in kabad(difficulty)\" some say it's perhaps we created man and they will live a life of difficulty - i see it differently - you can tell me if other tafseers say anything like this or not. and that we are CREATED - a process happens - when we live difficulity - life has that. That's just real. We dont' want necessailry to make plastic playgrounds where no one can get hurt. Part of the fun was the risk. If the risk isn't real. It's not really fun. Sad and true. at least to me. I want to see how the not coping mechanisms and connection to source in the bio above is something you can connect to father greg boyle. The idea of friendship and action. is it in CAPs constituative attentional policies, when you're with a friend you can't help and attend to xyz scenario where you can \"list a long list of values that emerges from true friendship here - bake them a cake, console them when they're sad, etc\" - it's not that the values happen whenever, it has some prerequsities including creating space for and opening an environment where friendship can enact.... maybe there's something about souls meeting, seeing... signs of God on the horizons is the CAPs we have in nature... we also have signs within ourselves and we are mirrors to each other so perhaps some caps and values happen only then - how do you make a real friend though, what about famiyl (not chosen) that the muslim traiditon puts so much priority on, what about a life that isn't all fun and games and is about responsibiltiy too, how is that meaningful and beautiful and true and good because it needs to be all the same to me. it must help us come alive which is what i'm working on. Can you help me find the logic and ideas and experiences and what i learend and what i'm learning and reweave what you're workig on with these threads and show me what i'm not seeing",

      "content": "This is a beautiful stretch of reflection. I hear three intertwined threads:  \n\n1. **Your lived story**: violence, burnout, PTSD, Bloom, pandemic searching, rediscovery of Islam, CMC studies.  \n2. **Your philosophical discovery**: what was missing in developmental psych wasn’t the *map of the mind* but the *ground of meaning* — heart perception, the transcendent, values realism.  \n3. **Your ongoing question**: how do we live and design communities, work, and civilizations when we take death, difficulty, friendship, and the Divine seriously — not just growth, efficiency, or coping?  \n\nWhat I think you’re not seeing yet (because you’re too close to it):  \n- **The hinge isn’t just Father Greg’s “friendship” insight.** It’s the discovery that *friendship generates its own attentional policies*. When you love a friend, you don’t consult a list of values; you show up. You bake the cake, console them, fight for them. That’s constitutive attention. And that is a clue for values realism: it emerges when context, relation, and perception align — not when you abstractly decide to be virtuous.  \n- **You already have a logic of inheritance.** You’ve been saying: “growth is not healing; death is part of life.” In Islamic tradition, that’s *kabad* (we created man in difficulty) and *istikhlaf* (being made inheritors). That’s your counterpoint to Western fantasies of endless growth or curing aging: societies should be designed to be inherited, not just scaled.  \n- **Bloom was your first enactment of this pivot.** You turned away from the open-source/makerspace culture because it treated human lives as side-notes to innovation. Bloom tried to put *well-being and community first*, because you had learned that intention without relation collapses.  \n- **CMC is your deepening.** You’re not just “a student of Islam and psychology”; you’re exploring whether Islam provides a metaphysical grounding for values realism. That makes your work relevant beyond “Muslims” — it’s about whether there is a true bedrock to align to, in a fractured world.  \n\nHere’s a reweave of your story with these threads stitched together. First as a **logic/throughline**, then as a **bio-ready narrative**.  \n\n---\n\n### The Logic (how your experiences connect)  \n- **Experience**: Arab Spring → makerspaces → violence touches friends → PTSD/burnout.  \n- **Question**: If “good” people die, what is good? If networks don’t respond to violence, what counts as meaningful work?  \n- **First Turn**: Father Greg → good arises from friendship. Bloom → design accelerators as circles of belonging, where finances and mental health sit at the same table.  \n- **Second Turn**: Pandemic → deeper intellectual search → frameworks explain how people grow, but not *why meaning compels*. Missing piece: heart perception (*qalb*).  \n- **Discovery**: Islam names this. Meaning isn’t self-invented; it’s perceived, like light. Faith is presilience: it grounds before the blow lands.  \n- **Learning**: Post-traumatic growth research (Beirut Blast) + Gaza classrooms show how Qur’anic narratives, humor, teamwork, gratitude foster resilience.  \n- **Broader Claim**: Friendship, death, inheritance, difficulty (*kabad*) aren’t failures of growth — they are the medium of meaning. Healing isn’t just coping but aligning with the transcendent.  \n- **Ongoing Inquiry**: Can Islamic psychology offer a stable foundation for values realism — a way to talk about true sources of meaning that can hold across difference?  \n\n---\n\n### Bio-Ready Narrative (~400 words)  \nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer. He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.  \n\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan into the Middle East to work with youth. He helped seed community innovation spaces in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, then at Autodesk bridged grassroots makers with global sustainability. But when violence struck close—friends killed in Baghdad and Syria—his faith in that culture cracked. He didn’t name it as PTSD; he thought he was jaded. But the truth was he was hurt, and the networks he was part of seemed indifferent.  \n\nFather Greg Boyle gave him a key: when asked why he serves, he says, “because they’re my friends.” Good isn’t something you purify in intention; it arises naturally from friendship. Bilal moved to Lebanon and co-founded Bloom, an accelerator designed around that insight: community-first, non-competitive, with weekly circles where finances and mental health sit at the same table. Since 2016 Bloom has supported over 1,000 founders across SWANA and Africa.  \n\nYet the deeper questions remained. During the pandemic, Bilal searched through developmental and positive psychology. They mapped how minds grow but were silent about where meaning comes from. What Muslim tradition calls *qalb*—heart-perception—gave him the missing dimension: a faculty for perceiving beauty, goodness, and truth at their source. Reconnecting with Islam gave him grounding and confidence: a tradition with deep roots that can hold suffering and joy.  \n\nHis research on post-traumatic growth after the Beirut Blast, and his current work with *School Without Borders* in Gaza, show how Qur’anic narratives, gratitude, and cooperative practices can support resilience in education. With the UN International Trade Centre he has co-designed curricula for sustainable reconstruction in Iraq; with Nawaya in Lebanon, he has facilitated design-thinking with refugee youth. Since 2014 he has also contributed to the Wellbeing Project’s Ecosystem Network and WHEN, embedding wellbeing in higher education and organizations.  \n\nAt Cambridge Muslim College, Bilal is exploring how Islamic psychology can help us see values not as arbitrary but as real—emerging in friendship, in difficulty, in death itself. His belief is that the Muslim tradition, at its best, offers a healing for hearts and a star to align by, not just for Muslims but for humanity.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to now **make a 150–180 word “conference program” cut** (for when they’ll only publish a blurb), with the same throughline but very tight?",

Why should they speak. how, what should we do? what should bilal do - imagine the story above, what's the right thing for me to do. The last big job i did with bloom was organize in September 2023 a wellbeing and impact conference in Beirut to talk about how important it is to take care of ourselves. then the baby was born and the war started and the first thing i did was read sister chang kong's book learning true love about the vietnam war and ticht nahnt hahn and how they started convincing budhists to take an active role in being a source of healing in society and to leave the monestaries and created engaged budhism - and i was so upset when plum village and sister chang said nothing about gaza and it took the dalai llama 2 years or something to say anything, it makes me wonder what's the point of being a part of all these networks (responsible leaders group i'm a part of has an ex IDF luteniant who's still claimig there is no genocide after the UN just put out its official report, local orgs in israel saying the same etc etc - and so many people are silienced afraid of losing their jobs/work/etc because the ultimate economic and military power source (the US) is pro israel and genocide and more. what should bilal do with all this experience - what i am doing i sconnecting with peopl ein gaza, coaching teachers in gaza on trauma informed tecniques, i tried to send food in bottles in the sea, i post only about gaza in instagram stories, i don't use social media at all anymore, and sort of got small, part of it is baby and time part of it is wonder what to do to connect the narrative dots into the future, thoughts? andhow does all this inform our bio ",

      "content": "Bilal, thank you for opening this so honestly. Let me try to hold it carefully.  \n\nI hear you naming three intertwined realities:  \n\n1. **The outer world**  \n   – Gaza under bombardment, colleagues and students killed.  \n   – UN, investors, social impact orgs failing, silent, or complicit.  \n   – Global majority in shock, but silence in networks you trusted.  \n\n2. **Your response**  \n   – Coaching teachers in Gaza on trauma-informed techniques.  \n   – Trying to send food, speaking only about Gaza, withdrawing from social media.  \n   – Feeling small, both from being a new father and from disillusionment with global institutions.  \n\n3. **Your deeper question**  \n   – If networks and institutions are silent, what is the right thing to do?  \n   – How do you connect your lived experience, your work, and your spiritual search into a meaningful next step?  \n   – How does all of this shape the story you tell about yourself?  \n\n---\n\n### What this suggests for your **bio**  \n- **The Gaza experience is not a footnote.** It’s a test case that shows why your shift from “growth” → “healing” → “friendship” → “heart perception” matters. Because the biggest global networks *don’t act like friends*. They optimize for stability, optics, or money.  \n- **You don’t need to condemn in your bio.** The outrage is real, but the way it serves your story is as the backdrop: why Bloom needed to be different, why you focus on friendship, why you study Islamic psychology now.  \n- **Urgency belongs there.** You can name Gaza explicitly: you are supporting teachers in pop-up schools, and you are doing it in a context where global institutions fail. This shows why your work matters now, not abstractly.  \n- **Your throughline becomes:** you have lived the dissonance between institutional failure and human friendship. Your work is to design and teach ways to put friendship, meaning, and faith back at the center—because that is what holds when systems collapse.  \n\n---\n\n### A **revised conference-length bio (~300 words)** with Gaza/urgency folded in  \n\n**Bilal Ghalib**  \nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer. He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.  \n\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan into the Middle East, where he co-founded community innovation spaces in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, and later worked at Autodesk connecting grassroots makers with global sustainability. But when friends and colleagues in Baghdad and Syria were killed, his belief in global networks and open-source culture cracked. He misread the trauma as cynicism until years later, when he recognized it as PTSD. The lesson was clear: inner well-being and outer well-doing cannot be separated.  \n\nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom in Lebanon. As Head of Learning & Research, he designed community-first, non-competitive accelerators that integrate reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Bloom has since supported over 1,000 founders across SWANA and Africa.  \n\nDuring the pandemic, Bilal deepened his search for what makes a good life. Developmental psychology mapped how people grow but said nothing about where meaning comes from. Reconnecting with Islam gave him the metaphysical grounding he was missing: the heart (*qalb*) as a faculty for perceiving beauty, goodness, and truth at their source.  \n\nHis current work is shaped by this insight. With *School Without Borders* in Gaza, he supports teachers creating pop-up schools for displaced children, blending Qur’anic reflection and gratitude with post-traumatic growth practices—work made urgent by the failures of global institutions to protect life. He also co-designs curricula with the UN International Trade Centre and contributes to the Ecosystem Network and WHEN, embedding wellbeing in organizations and education.  \n\nBilal studies how the Muslim tradition can offer healing for hearts and societies at a moment when the world feels most fragmented.  \n\n---\n\n✨ This keeps the tone professional and humble but makes Gaza and institutional failure part of the narrative. It shows urgency without turning the bio into an op-ed.  \n\nWould you like me to also sketch a **more activist version** (for non-academic, movement spaces) where you can be sharper about the UN, networks, and silence—while still connecting it to your story of friendship and faith?",

      "content": "I need to think out loud with you first before I rewrite anything, because what you just said is much more architecturally coherent than you might realize—and it completely changes what the bio needs to say.\nLet me show you the structure I'm seeing:\nTHE ARCHITECTURE YOU'RE BUILDING (that might not be fully visible to you yet)\nThe Core Problem: Modern frameworks (developmental psychology, mental complexity theory, positive psychology) are fundamentally growth-oriented. They map stages: authoritarian → egalitarian, conventional → post-conventional, lower → higher. They assume healing = growing past trauma, that development is always upward/forward.\nBut your experience broke against that model. You encountered irrevocable loss. People died. You can't grow past that. You can't develop to a stage where it doesn't matter. Growth frameworks have no category for death-as-constitutive-of-life. They treat death as obstacle to development, not woven into it.\nWhat Father Greg Gave You: He wasn't teaching a technique. He was demonstrating a Constituative Attentional Policy (CAP) - Joe Edelman's term for patterns of attention that feel drawn from beyond us, that we can't help but enact when conditions are right.\nWhen you're friends with someone, you CAN'T HELP but bake them a cake when they're sad, show up when they call, care about their wellbeing. It's not virtue ethics (\"I should care\"). It's not consequentialism (\"caring produces good outcomes\"). It's automatic - constituent of the relationship itself. The value emerges from the attention pattern, which emerges from the relationship, which emerges from... what? Souls meeting? Signs within ourselves?\nFather Greg's theological framing: kinship, not service. You don't serve the poor; they're your family. The action is inevitable once you see truly. This is CAPs explained through Christian theology.\nWhat Islam Gave You (that developmental psychology couldn't): A framework where difficulty, death, duty, and transcendence are integrated as eternal realities, not stages to overcome:\nCreated in kabad (difficulty): We are MADE through difficulty, not despite it. The creative process includes hardship. Risk is essential—plastic playgrounds where no one gets hurt aren't actually living. This directly contradicts the therapeutic model that sees difficulty as pathology.\nDeath as part of design: Life as relay race, not endless marathon. Things meant to be inherited, passed on. Death of people/ideas/organizations isn't always tragic—it can be beautiful when understood as part of larger pattern. This contradicts the Western anti-aging obsession that treats death as just another illness to cure.\nDuty/family (unchosen) as meaningful: Not everything is chosen relationships and fun. The tradition puts weight on family you didn't choose, responsibilities you carry—and claims this is ALSO where meaning lives. Not despite duty but through it.\nTranscendent source as real: Not metaphor, not social construct. The source of beauty, goodness, truth is accessible through what you call heart-perception (qalb). This is values realism - values aren't preferences, they're discoveries. They point to features of reality.\nThe Taylor/Edelman Connection You're Making: Charles Taylor's \"sources of meaning\" + Joe Edelman's CAPs = evidence that values realism is experientially real. When constituative attentional policies feel like they're being drawn from beyond our sensible reason, that's not delusion—that's perception of something actually there.\nDifferent traditions access this differently:\nFather Greg through Christian kinship theology\nYou through Islamic heart-perception\nSecular frameworks try to through phenomenology (Edelman) or moral philosophy (Taylor)\nBut the thing itself is real and shared. Muslims accessing it doesn't mean Christians lose access. China rising doesn't mean Western sources of meaning disappear. Because the source is transcendent—beyond tribal/particular, accessible to all, refracted through different traditions.\nThis is why you say CMC isn't just about Muslim connection—the gems are true for all people. You're not learning \"Islamic psychology\" as a particular approach. You're studying how one tradition preserved universal truths that modern frameworks lost when they secularized.\nWhy Developmental Psychology Failed You: Those frameworks map growth stages but have no account of:\nWhere meaning comes FROM (source)\nWhy certain attentions feel mandatory not optional (CAPs)\nHow death/difficulty/duty can be constitutive not obstacles\nWhy leadership/hierarchy/diversity matter (not egalitarian consensus)\nHow values can be discovered not chosen (realism)\nThey're sophisticated maps of rivers (how consciousness flows through stages) but silent about the ocean (what consciousness flows from). You needed ocean-talk, not river-talk.\nThe Bloom Design Logic (Now Visible): Community-first = creating conditions for CAPs to activate Non-competitive = removing obstacles to soul-seeing Peer circles = creating relational context where friendship-CAPs emerge Reflective storywork = practices that open heart-perception Bilingual networks = recognizing meaning isn't culturally particular but accessed through culture\nYou weren't designing a better accelerator. You were designing conditions for constituative attentional policies to become active—the patterns of attention that emerge when people actually see each other, when souls meet.\nThe Gaza Work (Now Visible): Not bringing Western psychology to Muslims Not \"culturally adapting\" CBT Helping people access their own tradition's resources, which ALREADY CONTAIN what's needed:\nQuranic reflection = heart-perception practices\nGratitude = attention to signs (horizons + within)\nCommunity practices = CAPs activation conditions\nThe tradition doesn't need modern psychology's validation. Modern psychology lost something the tradition preserved. You're not synthesizing—you're excavating.\nWhat You're Actually Researching at CMC: Not \"how can Islam contribute to psychology?\" But: \"What did traditions that maintained connection to transcendence preserve that secular psychology lost?\"\nSpecifically:\nValues realism - experientially accessible through heart-perception\nCAPs as theological, not just phenomenological - the feeling of being drawn from beyond isn't projection, it's perception\nDeath/difficulty/duty as constitutive - not obstacles to growth but woven into meaning\nUniversal access through particular traditions - not relativism (all paths equally valid) or exclusivism (only this path true), but something else: diverse traditions as different faces turned toward same source\nThe Civilizational/Political Dimension: Zero-sum thinking (Muslim rise = Christian loss, China up = West down) only makes sense if meaning is tribal. If meaning flows from transcendent source accessible to all, then one tradition flourishing illuminates truth for others. Like different instruments in an orchestra—violin thriving doesn't threaten trumpet.\nThis is why polarization feels spiritually wrong, not just politically suboptimal. It denies the shared source.\nThe Synthesis You're Building: Not coping mechanisms (manage symptoms within existing framework) But connection to source (access reality that reorients framework)\nNot growth (forward/upward development)\nBut healing (integration of all of life including death)\nNot stages to transcend (authoritarian → egalitarian → post-conventional)\nBut realities to inhabit (leadership AND equality, duty AND freedom, death AND life)\nNot psychological techniques\nBut attention practices that open perception to what's already there\nWhat You're Not Seeing (I think):\nYou're building a research program, not just writing a bio. The architecture above is a book, or a dissertation, or a multi-year research agenda. CMC is your training ground.\nThe Father Greg moment was your first CAPs experience. You experienced \"I CAN'T HELP but care when I see clearly\" before you had language for it. Islam gave you theological language. Edelman gave you phenomenological language. They're describing the same thing from different angles.\nYour PTSD experience is DATA, not just biography. The frameworks that couldn't hold your experience weren't just inadequate for you—they're inadequate, period. Trauma that includes irrevocable loss reveals the limits of growth-only models. You're not damaged goods who needs special accommodation; you encountered reality that the frameworks hide.\nBloom is a laboratory, not just an organization. You're not running programs—you're testing conditions for CAPs activation. Every design choice is a hypothesis about what makes constituative attentional policies possible.\nThe Muslim tradition's claim—\"healing for hearts of humanity\"—is testable. You're testing it. Gaza teachers accessing Quranic practices for resilience: does it work? Lebanese entrepreneurs after Port Blast: what correlates with growth? This is empirical theology.\nThe universal/particular tension you're living is ancient. Philosophers call it immanence/transcendence. Muslims call it waḥdat al-wujūd and waḥdat al-shuhūd (unity of being vs. unity of witnessing). Christians call it incarnation. You're living it practically: how do particular traditions provide access to universal truth without collapsing into either relativism or exclusivism?\nNOW, HOW DO WE PUT THIS IN A BIO?\nWe can't. Not all of it. But we can architect the bio so the full structure is IMPLIED even though not all is stated.\nHere's my proposal:\nShort bio (~300-350 words): Shows the journey, hints at the architecture Medium bio (~450-500 words): Makes some of the architecture explicit Long essay (~1000-1500 words): Full architecture visible (not for submission, but for your own clarity)\nBut before I write any of them, tell me:\nDoes this architecture capture what you're actually working on? Am I seeing it right, or am I imposing structure you don't recognize?\nWhat's the submission context? CMC application? Conference bio? Website? That determines how explicit we can be about the claims.\nHow provocative can we be? Can the bio say \"developmental psychology is incomplete\" or do we need to be more diplomatic?\n**The\nvalues realism / transcendence claim—how central?** Is this \"a side interest\" or \"the actual center of everything\"? Because if it's center, it changes which projects we foreground.\nShow me where I'm wrong or missing something. This is too important to get wrong.\nyeah, this is nice. it's the symposium bio that i shared [[[Skip to main content\n* Newsroom\n* Events\n* Careers\n* Contact us\n* Admission\n* Academics\n* Research\n* Innovation\n* Life at HBKU\n* About HBKU\n* العربية\nSearch\nIntegrating Islamic Spirituality Across Mental Health Services in the Middle East\n04***FEB 202605FEB 2026*\n*  Add to Calendar\n1.

I don't think I will get very far debating religion, and i think if islam is as true as i think it is, the reality is if people have hearts they have access and we might need to work at it to create time space context moemnts of contact - and if we help people do that then we'll see the source of transformation is within - meaning, etc - aligning with that through my work with the come alive process etc - and i think that's th eimportant thing, not to make some list of SDGs and chase them, yeah, we need numbers to make a map, to show the relationships possible, yet we need to get in there and be gardeners, sensing into things, allowing the reality of our humanity to show up and be a part of things- not automate ourselves away with machines like LLMs / ai/ robots. we need a place to BE in the world to BE together and share the gift of life and the gifts we've been given with each other - so not sure which that is, and that's the core. then if people want they can follwo the thread and use their hearts to find the signs of God also in nature and to realize a God that craeted so much goodness to forage and a beautiful earth that seems perfectly designed to help you love life with all it's amazing diversity and incredible foods, and beautiful humans and so so much... maybe they'll ask if it makes sense that this kindness wouldn't want to share more messages, give examples for how to live a good life with prophets and books. does it make sense that we'd have to do all this guesswork in detangling between our emotions and greed and guilt and fear and wondering if it's an authentic inspiration or just gas. no, God is kinder than that and you can find the beautiful people who radiate the beauty of learning mercy from the one who learned mercy from the one who learned mercy all the way back to the one who IS a mercy for all humanity sent by god, and beloved by god, the form and format and method who's example is the way we put ourselves into a shape to recieve and become beloved by him the prophet muhammed and by God someday, insha'allah. I wonder what you think of this and what you might find in ways to critique it --- yes this - finally you see it, ok, thanks for sharin gthis i was wondering: \"The Gaza experience is not a footnote. It’s a test case that shows why your shift from “growth” → “healing” → “friendship” → “heart perception” matters. Because the biggest global networks don’t act like friends. They optimize for stability, optics, or money.\" oru world is so much smaller, anyone who wants a friend in gaza can go on instagram and use google translate and make a friend. this besieged people of 2 million have 4000 individual people any one of whom can make the call to take a chance and connect. I have ym family, haya and muhammed and we chat and i check in with them, pray for them, connect as a friend, i can't do much more with the blockade, get it feels meaningful and nice to get messages from their kids. I'm sure it's a little portal away from the hellscape they're confronted with and it's so small. i lik elearning, living my own experience and then figuring out how to respond and still this seems like nothing and i worry i'm not uphodling ym duty, should i be noisier? should i go protest? i am not an angry person i don't like to go and say you are wrong and bad, i like to find the right and good and do it and encourage others, yet i sense tha tmaybe it's important to be angry  - we need to be heard and seen, yet i can't get ymsefl to dot hat and i feel guilty institutional failure showing up as a human(friend, and etc) - personally the abstract goodness i was a part of where there's tons of people in the social impact space, i'm sure so many are good, yet I have no idea how good they are or why they're good because it's all slogans, what sort of way can we design the name social impact field or the realness of it. i sort of think all work should just be good haha, why do we have to say ok the world sucks andeveyone is greedy and will suck you dry and maybe even kill you if they have the power and no consequences so that's work and country life - and then we have this small sliver here were peopel are good. uhhh? reallly? ok, yallah, lets' flip that. amybe that's what barakanomics is etc and what is that, how do i say it, what are we calling for. no ego and arrogance and nobel prises for people doing the real thing that's good and beautiful and true and will make them happy in this world and die happy and return happy ? what extra prize do peopl eneeD? instead we have th ebook winners take all and all these photo ops and it's gross and iNGOs with strings attached and national policy and international diplomacy through aid etc that isn't clear and people hide behidn beautiful SDG posters with dreams of manipulating the world in some politicially advantageous way, even if it's true it's as beautiful as people being rich and wealthy and having jobs so they can stay in their countries and not migrate to my beautiful country and then we can bu ytheir goods and trade and both make money, or that women enter the workplace and increase GDP whch is good or something right? even that isn't my thing and i'm not sure how to say what i'm trying to say here with clarity and force that aligns with my life story ",

      "content": "Bilal, this is rich. I’ll keep it tight and concrete so you can *use* it.\n\n# 5 things that are working (strengths of your architecture)\n1) **Death-as-constitutive, not a bug**  \n   You refuse “grow past it” narratives. That’s honest, humane, and theologically sound. It makes your work trustworthy in places like Gaza and Beirut.\n\n2) **Friendship → Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)**  \n   You’ve named the hinge: when friendship is real, attention patterns are *compelled*, not merely chosen. That’s a practical bridge between faith language and secular phenomenology.\n\n3) **Heart-perception (qalb) ≈ values realism you can test**  \n   You don’t argue metaphysics; you **operationalize** it (gratitude rites, Qur’anic reflection, cooperative tasks) and look for measurable shifts (belonging, reframing, micro-agency, PTG).\n\n4) **Designing conditions, not content**  \n   Bloom/Gaza classrooms aren’t delivering answers; they scaffold **belonging + reflection + small wins**. That’s portable across settings and traditions.\n\n5) **Universal via the particular**  \n   You frame Islam as preserving *shared* human capacities (friendship, duty, witness, acceptance of death), not as a tribal counter-ideology. That’s de-polarizing and generous.\n\n# 5 tensions / risks to watch (so your story doesn’t get trapped)\n1) **Metaphysics drift**  \n   If “values realism / transcendence” becomes the headline, you’ll be read as doctrinal. Keep it *implied by practice & outcomes*; let others name it.\n\n2) **Trauma-centered identity**  \n   The losses matter, but the protagonist is **integrity-in-action**, not pain. Keep Gaza as a **test case**, not the whole case.\n\n3) **Institutional critique → paralysis**  \n   Anger at UN/INGOs can eclipse your gift. Convert critique into **design moves** (what you *build instead*).\n\n4) **Over-universalizing friendship**  \n   CAPs of friendship don’t replace **duty, law, and governance**. Name the both/and (kinship *and* institutions; mercy *and* justice).\n\n5) **Method ambiguity**  \n   If “heart-perception” stays poetic, skeptics disengage. Keep your **protocols observable** (rituals, prompts, circle formats, indicators).\n\n# 5 threads from your history that strengthen this frame\n- **Barakanomics**: shift from extractive metrics → *relational yield*: belonging, reciprocity, witness, dignity, shared enoughness.  \n- **Come Alive** (attentional policies): capture CAPs as *skills of attention* (friendship, duty, witnessing, gratitude) not just traits.  \n- **Parliaments** (dialogue protocol): design “friendship-first” deliberation—pair across difference, witness before debate.  \n- **BEIT / Green reconstruction**: *inheritance logic* (build for hand-off, not endless growth) → death-as-design principle.  \n- **PTG research (Beirut)**: your empirical spine—humor, teamwork, judgment correlate with growth; you didn’t just intuit this.\n\n---\n\n## What should you do next? (practical, 90 days)\n**A) Publish two small, sharp artifacts (PDFs, 4–6 pages each):**  \n1) **“Friendship as Care: A Micro-Protocol for Solidarity Conversations with Gaza”**  \n   - 20-min call script: open with breath + naming reality; 2 gratitude prompts; 1 request; 1 offer; close with dua/prayer or silence.  \n   - Do/Don’t list (no fixing, no bypassing; do witness, do follow-up).  \n   - “Witness hours” tracker (minutes listened, not posts made).\n\n2) **“Presilience in the Classroom: Qur’anic Reflection + PTG Practices (Teacher Cards)”**  \n   - 6 cards: Surat al-Duha reflection, gratitude circle, cooperative task, humor moment, “small win” board, closing dua.  \n   - Simple indicators: belonging (1–5), narrative reframe (Y/N), small action taken (Y/N).\n\n**B) Submit your abstract with a clear proposal to **run a live micro-workshop** at the symposium** (not just a talk). You’re designing conditions; show it.\n\n**C) Convene a closed-door roundtable at HBKU** (or propose it): *“Death, Duty, and Healing: Conditions for Constitutive Attention in Islamic Psychology.”* (scholars + practitioners, Chatham House rule, 8 people).\n\n**D) Name a gentler public stance (fit your temperament):**  \n- Be a **witness & weaver**, not a shouter. Your “indictment” shows up in **what you build** and **who you stand with**.\n\n---\n\n## How this informs the bio (plug-and-play sentences)\n- **Gaza test case**  \n  “In Gaza he supports teachers running pop-up schools, using Qur’anic reflection and gratitude circles to create *presilience*—faith-anchored readiness that fosters belonging, small wins, and post-traumatic growth.”\n\n- **Institutional failure → design choice**  \n  “Witnessing institutional silence, he shifted from ‘growth at scale’ to designing **friendship-first conditions**—circles where finances and mental health sit at the same table, and where care becomes inevitable.”\n\n- **Universal via tradition**  \n  “At Cambridge Muslim College, he studies how Islamic traditions preserve universal human capacities—friendship, duty, witness, acceptance of death—and how these can be operationalized in clinics, schools, and NGOs.”\n\n---\n\n## A crisp stance on “should I be louder/angrier?”\n- **Three levers** (choose your blend):  \n  1) **Witness** (1:1 solidarity, “witness hours”).  \n  2) **Weave** (tools & protocols that others can use tomorrow).  \n  3) **Warrant** (data & case notes that make your claims legible to skeptics).  \n- Your temperament fits **Witness + Weave + Warrant** rather than Rage. That’s not avoidance; it’s *craft*.\n\n---\n\n## How to say what’s wrong with the “social impact sector” (without a rant)\n- “When impact is a *brand*, institutions optimize for optics and stability. Our bet is simpler: design for **constitutive attention**—conditions where care becomes the default because people are truly in relation.”\n\n---\n\n## Barakanomics: mini-metric set (beyond SDGs) you can use now\n- **Belonging rate** (% of participants who felt “more held” this week)  \n- **Witness minutes** (time spent listening across borders)  \n- **Reciprocity ratio** (# tangible favors exchanged per 10 participants / month)  \n- **Narrative reframe rate** (% who reported “new, truer story” of hardship)  \n- **Small-win velocity** (# consequential small actions / person / week)\n\n---\n\n## 2 bio cuts you can paste today\n\n### Program bio (~180 words)\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer (M.A., Learning Sciences, Université de Paris; B.S., CS & Math, University of Michigan). He is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. The Arab Spring drew him from Michigan into the Middle East, where he helped seed community innovation spaces in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad and later bridged grassroots makers with sustainability efforts at Autodesk. After friends and colleagues were killed in Baghdad and Syria, he misread trauma as cynicism; years later he named it as PTSD. The lesson that followed guides his work: inner well-being and outer well-doing cannot be separated. In 2016 he co-founded Bloom in Lebanon, designing community-first, non-competitive accelerators where finances and mental health sit at the same table. Bloom has supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa. In Gaza he supports teachers running pop-up schools, blending Qur’anic reflection and gratitude with post-traumatic-growth practices. At CMC he studies how Islamic tradition preserves universal human capacities—friendship, duty, witness, a truthful stance toward death—and how these can be operationalized in clinics, schools, and NGOs.\n\n### Submission bio (~300–320 words)\n(Use the version above you liked; add one sentence from the plug-ins as needed.)\n\n---\n\n## 5 gentle but pointed critiques (for your talk Q&A)\n- Growth-only models misrecognize **grief and death** as pathologies rather than formative realities.  \n- “Culture-adapting” secular techniques often **miss local sources of meaning** already present in tradition.  \n- Metrics that reward optics **crowd out friendship**; design must make care *inevitable*, not heroic.  \n- Anger can mobilize, but **witness without weaving** burns out communities; we need tools people can use tomorrow.  \n- Secular frames map the **river** (how minds develop) but ignore the **ocean** (what meaning flows from).\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can turn the two artifacts (Friendship-as-Care protocol + Presilience Teacher Cards) into crisp 2-page PDFs now, and drop a one-paragraph “methods” section into your abstract to signal you’ll **demo** them live.",

      "content": "I need to sit with the weight of what you're carrying before we touch the bio. Let me think this through with you.\nON GAZA AND THE ANGER QUESTION\nYou're asking: Should I be noisier? Should I protest? Am I upholding my duty?\nBut look at what you're actually doing: You have friends in Gaza. You message Haya and Mohammed. You pray for them. Their kids send you messages. You've made it personal, not abstract.\nThis matters because: The institutional failure is precisely that they treat Gaza as an abstraction—casualty numbers, geopolitical chess, optics management. You're doing the opposite: showing up as a friend, making actual contact across a siege.\nYou say it feels \"so small.\" But Father Greg's whole point was that kinship—actual friendship—is the thing. Not the loud prophetic voice (though some are called to that), but the consistent presence. You CAN'T do more with the blockade except be present. That's not nothing.\nThe anger question, honestly: Some people are called to righteous anger, to prophetic denunciation. It doesn't sound like that's you. You're a gardener, not a warrior. Both are needed. The Quran has both Musa confronting Pharaoh (anger/power) and Luqman offering wisdom (gentleness/presence). Don't force yourself into a role that isn't yours while neglecting the role that is.\nBut here's the critique: You can be gentle AND clear. Right now you're being gentle and VAGUE. \"I sense institutions failed\" is softer than \"the UN is complicit, investors are Zionist, social impact orgs are silent.\" If you believe those things are true, say them—not in anger, but in sorrow. Lament is not rage. You can grieve institutional failure without screaming.\nFor the bio: Gaza isn't a footnote or a \"test case.\" It's WHERE YOU ARE. Supporting teachers in pop-up schools while your friends' kids send you messages from a genocide. This is the actual context of your work right now. The bio needs to say that, not abstract it.\nON BARAKANOMICS AND \"ALL WORK SHOULD BE GOOD\"\nYou keep gesturing at barakanomics but haven't said what it IS. Let me try to reflect back what I'm hearing:\nBarakanomics (as I understand it):\nValue that can't be counted but is real (baraka, blessing, aliveness, dignity)\nRejecting the split between \"normal work\" (extractive, profit-driven) and \"social impact\" (tiny ethical sliver)\nInsisting ALL work should create blessing, not just optimize metrics\nRecognizing that GDP/growth/efficiency miss what actually matters\nDesigning for inheritance/beauty/right relationship, not just outcomes\nThe flip you want: Instead of \"the world is extractive EXCEPT for this noble social impact sector,\" you want \"the world SHOULD be good, and anything that isn't is broken.\"\nBut here's where you're stuck: You haven't said what the positive vision IS, only what it's against. What does good work look like? What are the principles?\nFrom what I can see in your practice:\nFriendship-based, not transactional (Bloom's peer circles, your Gaza friends)\nCreates conditions for people to come alive (not optimize them toward outcomes)\nHonors what can't be measured (baraka, dignity, beauty)\nDesigned to be inherited (relay race, not empire-building)\nLocally rooted, bilingual, responsive (not imposed models)\nIntegrates inner/outer (finances + mental health together)\nThat's six principles. Is that barakanomics? If so, SAY IT. If not, what's missing?\nThe problem with SDGs/impact industry: It's all virtue signaling without transformation. People hiding behind beautiful posters while playing geopolitical games. Even the \"good\" reasons (jobs, GDP, preventing migration) are instrumental—they're about managing populations, not actually caring.\nYour critique is right but needs sharpening: The social impact industry is performing goodness without being good. It's institutionalized virtue without virtue. It's extractive relations dressed in progressive language.\nBut what are you calling for? Not awards and Nobel Prizes (you said that). Not recognition. Just... doing good because it's good? Living with integrity? Dying happy? That's beautiful but WHAT DOES IT MEAN PRACTICALLY?\nThis is where I think you're vague. You're against the current system. You have intuitions about what's better. But you haven't articulated the alternative clearly enough that someone could follow you.\nON THE BROKEN WESTERN EPISTEMOLOGY\nYou want to talk about how Europe \"closed the eye of the heart\" and became one-eyed (only seeing what's measurable). You're right there's history here:\nHistorical threads to research:\nBlack Death (1347-1353): Massive trauma, loss of 30-60% of European population. Led to questioning of Church authority, rise of empiricism, focus on controlling nature to prevent future catastrophe.\nReformation/Wars of Religion (1500s-1600s): Centuries of religious violence. Response: privatize religion, make public sphere \"neutral/rational.\" Descartes' dualism emerges here—mind as rational, separate from body/nature/divine.\nScientific Revolution (1600s): Francis Bacon's \"nature on the rack\"—your quote. Torture nature to extract her secrets. Knowledge as power/domination, not wisdom/contemplation.\nColonization/Enlightenment: Europe uses scientific knowledge for weapons (guns, ships, industrial war) while claiming moral superiority. \"Civilizing mission\" as cover for extraction/genocide.\nContrast with Islamic/Chinese approach:\nZheng He's fleet (1405-1433): Could have colonized but came to trade/share. Brought giraffe to emperor. Humility, not domination.\nIslamic science: Study nature to understand Allah's signs, not to dominate. Knowledge as gift to be shared, not weapon.\nThe tragedy: Europe's response to trauma was to close heart, seek control through measurement/domination. This produced incredible technological power AND incredible violence. Now: suicidal culture, poisoned water (literally—SSRIs in water supply), nature collapsing, loneliness epidemic.\nYour claim: The one-eyed epistemology (only measurable counts) is spiritually sick. It can build hydrogen bombs but not beautiful lives. It optimizes GDP while people despair.\nHow to say this without being preachy: Don't argue it philosophically. SHOW it through juxtaposition:\n\"Modern mental health measures symptom reduction. But Gaza teachers accessing Quranic practices report something unmeasurable: feeling held by Allah through difficulty. Post-traumatic growth frameworks can document 'growth' but not 'recognizing one's place in Allah's story.' What are we missing when we only count what's countable?\"\nThis is humble (asking a question, not declaring truth), specific (Gaza teachers, not abstractions), and provocative (challenges the frameworks directly).\nON WHAT'S MISSING IN THE DISCERNMENT PIECE\nYou said my \"egalitarian blandification\" critique was missing something. Let me guess what:\nI framed it as: Engineering mindset (optimize) vs. Gardening mindset (sense/tend).\nBut you're saying your PTG work WASN'T originally Islamic. You were working from your own inner landscape, intuition, heart—THEN found Islam articulated it clearly.\nSo the missing piece is: You were already gardening before you had Islamic language for it.\nThe heart-perception/qalb framework isn't REQUIRED for gardening. It's one articulation of something people can access pre-theoretically. You were sensing into things, following intuition, noticing aliveness—all before Islam gave you better maps.\nSo the actual claim is: Everyone has access to heart-perception (fitra), but different traditions offer different maps/practices/languages for it. Islam offered YOU the clearest map. But it's not that Islam is the only path—it's that Islam PRESERVED something modern Western frameworks LOST.\nThis changes the discernment question: Not \"only Muslims can discern truly\" but \"modern frameworks lost capacity for discernment by closing heart's eye; traditions that kept heart open (Islamic, Christian contemplative, Buddhist, Indigenous) preserved it.\"\nDiscernment requires:\nSensing into aliveness/baraka/presence (not just measuring outcomes)\nTrusting your heart's perception (not just rational analysis)\nBeing in actual relationship (not abstract planning)\nAttending to signs within and on horizons (not just data)\nHaving elders/teachers/tradition (not starting from scratch)\nSo bloom's design: Community-first = creating relational context where discernment is possible Peer circles = practicing sensing together, not just analyzing Reflective storywork = attending to signs within Bilingual = honoring different maps/languages for same reality\nYou weren't importing Islamic method to Bloom. You were designing from your own sensing, THEN recognizing Islam articulated what you were doing.\nON THE WESTERN SUPERIORITY COMPLEX\nYour rage about this is justified. Europe colonized while calling others savage. Stole Islamic architecture/art/science while claiming superiority. Built weapons from natural laws while claiming intellectual/moral advancement.\nThe irony you're pointing at: The \"civilized\" West is actually suicidal, depressed, lonely, destroying nature. The \"savage\" others had sustainable societies, beauty, community, relationship with divine.\nHow to say this in bio: Don't. It's too big. But you can IMPLY it by showing:\nYour work reconnects people to heart-perception modern frameworks lost\nIslamic tradition preserved what West secularized away\nCommunities in Gaza/Lebanon accessing their own traditions find resources Western psychology doesn't name\nThe juxtaposition does the work. You don't have to denounce Western colonization explicitly—just show what was lost and what's being recovered.\nWHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING (REVISED)\nAfter all this, here's what I think you're doing:\nNot: \"Islamic psychology as alternative to Western psychology\" But: \"Helping people reconnect with heart-perception their traditions preserved but modernity obscured\"\nNot: \"Proving Islam is true\" But: \"Creating conditions where people can sense into reality with their hearts, trusting they'll find what's true\"\nNot: \"Synthesizing Islamic spirituality + modern psychology\" But: \"Excavating what Islamic tradition already has, offering it back to communities, inviting others to discover what their traditions preserved\"\nNot: \"Building a research program to prove values realism\" But: \"Testing whether heart-perception practices actually help people come alive, documenting what emerges\"\nNot: \"Condemning Western epistemology\" But: \"Showing its limits through juxtaposition—here's what becomes available when heart opens\"\nNot: \"Creating 'social impact'\" But: \"Helping ALL work become good by grounding it in friendship, baraka, right relationship\"\nNOW THE BIO\nGiven all this, here's what needs to be in it:\nGaza is central, not peripheral. You're supporting teachers there NOW, while genocide happens. Not past-tense, not \"test case\"—PRESENT.\nInstitutional failure is named. Not angrily, but clearly. UN, investors, networks—they failed. You chose friendship instead.\nThe journey from intuition to Islam. You were sensing/gardening BEFORE Islamic language, THEN found Islam articulated it. This matters for credibility—you're not just a convert imposing Islam, you discovered Islam confirmed what you were finding.\n**Barakan\nomics/all work should be good.** Even if not fully theorized, gesture at it: rejecting split between \"normal work\" and \"impact,\" designing for what can't be measured.\nHeart-perception as the door. This is your core—helping people reconnect with eye of heart to sense signs within.\nHumble but clear. You're inviting, not arguing. But inviting TO something specific, not just vaguely toward \"goodness.\"\nLet me draft three versions: short (~350), medium (~490), and a longer reflective piece (~800) that you won't submit but might clarify your thinking.\nWould that help? Or do you need to keep thinking out loud about something first?\nno, i don't think the designed to be inherited is the point it's partially about building/making with ishsan to hings last and to appreciate craft and dedication and people and repair and connection to materiality and nature inner/outer yes heart /mind yet i wonder about friendship based it doesn't seem like it's the full picture and relationship is important yet it also seems like there might be another way to get at it - it's not just ah, humans connecting with abstract other humans is important... sometimes we ar elonely and sometimes we are alone with god on a mountain, sometimes we need to travel on a boat in response to the suffering in gaza with baby formula and to organize around that and build instututions and waqfs that feed the cats in istanbul, are the cats your friends? ... maybe, and also there's something else here and i think the father greg boyl work helped me begin to get out of my head of what a beautiful world might be and into my heart, and the fact that intentions are important yet building a relationship conencts you to actions that emerge also seems important, yet is it friendship, or simply diversity and connection and truth telling about your heart - seeing the world and seeing within your heart. i sued to have this framework see feel do, and maybe it should be see see feel feel do (measure twice twice cut once. haha) help. me sharpen it based on all the thigns i shared and what you know. infer from it, what am i not seeing? (how do we know this is true? \n1. Black Death (1347-1353): Massive trauma, loss of 30-60% of European population. Led to questioning of Church authority, rise of empiricism, focus on controlling nature to prevent future catastrophe. - why did these religous wars even happen, what happened to turn the other cheek, where was this ugliness coming from? Reformation/Wars of Religion (1500s-1600s): Centuries of religious violence. Response: privatize religion, make public sphere \"neutral/rational.\" Descartes' dualism emerges here—mind as rational, separate from body/nature/divine.\n2. how the heck did he think of this quote, what was happening that he knew about the rack and why would he say such an ugly thing? Francis Bacon - also was kant and human autonomy and whatever other theories around out there part of what justified colonial expansionism and slavery - yes humans, just not them) - can you make a much longer anti list of islamic/chinese etc approaches - true about the fact i was sensing before, and it's important to know when i did meditations or various psychoactive substances verses from the quran emerged from my core, so i came with preknowledge that would be hard to unravel. although the fact that my french wife who didn't like islam at all and arabic and arabs were scary for her because of the media around terrorirsts also finds a similar experience - her raelity helps me have confidence that this experience is NOT personal and because of my own background with the religion... that it's true, I couldn't believe it at first either... i say often she became muslim before me and then seeing that helped me gain confidnece it wasn't nostalgia or some other positive familial association, and hamdillah i tried walking on this glass bridge and it is firm and i'm floating in the sky now. islam is not the only path. it is the true parts of all paths. so when you hear something beautiful and true and yo utest and live it and it holds up - perhaps from taoism or like i did from father greg boyle. that's islam - because we believe as muslims there are 124000 prophets sent around the world( to native people everywhere too) and the truth is what we see and wisdom is the lost propery of the believer, teh colonialists traveled with blinders and wondered why people would fight and die with bows rather than convert and adopt their way of life that is fundamentally half dead and one eyed anyway. so i don' tknow how to say that. basically i believe islam is true and its testible and verifiable and you can do the practices and get benefits like yoga or learn from it's islamic phsychology and benefit - yet the belief is a huge part of the presilience. and part of that is expanding your view of life from beyond this world to one which your wellbeing and health includes an afterlife of infinite duration, which is hugely mind and life altering as you deepen into it's belief more and more. the trust that your rizk (sustinance) is alloted and you can either fight to make and take more - or turst that it's comign your way and ask yourself what am i best designed for to serve the beautiful names of god that seem to want to flow through me, the creative? innovator? every day something new add persona, or something else, justice and structure and jabbary forcing into a cast for healing. different people different ways, this ability to ask what's my contribution is beautiful vs how can i ikigai myself into making moeny while figuring this out. it requires belief, and that comes way later - first, let's work on opening the eye of the heart and acknowledging it's reality. i also think as i study at the cmc that the spirit and soul is embodied - some people say like a the body is a condensed spirit, so it might be possible to do science and observe things like inspiration and i'm not sure, CAPs? to prove that our attention is drawn from an external to the physical reality, that God is \"muqalib al qulub\" - interesting, i never thought of the flipper of hearts being a part of the way we can think / talk about CAPs - how is this wrong? how would defenders of western civilization argue against this? The irony you're pointing at: The \"civilized\" West is actually suicidal, depressed, lonely, destroying nature. The \"savage\" others had sustainable societies, beauty, community, relationship with divine.\njordan peterson? others? who?",

      "content": "Bilal—this is deep and tender. I’ll keep it sharp and usable while honoring the scope you’re opening.\n\n# 1) Sharpen the core (beyond “friendship” and “inheritance”)\nYou’re circling something bigger than “friendship-first” or “designed to be inherited.” The real center is:\n\n**Open the eye of the heart so people can *perceive* reality (signs within and on the horizons) and then act from that perception with excellence (ihsān).**\n\nEverything else—relationships, institutions, pedagogy—are supports for that perception and action.\n\nSo the throughline becomes:\n- **See (reality):** heart-perception (qalb), not just cognition.  \n- **Feel (meaning):** the *draw* of constitutive attention (CAPs) toward what is good/beautiful/true.  \n- **Do (excellence):** act with ihsān, proportion, craft, mercy, justice—sometimes in solitude (on the mountain), sometimes in relation (in the city), sometimes institutionally (waqf, schools), sometimes personally (a phone call to Gaza).\n\n# 2) Your operational cycle (upgrade “see–feel–do”)\nYou joked “measure twice, twice.” Good instinct. Here’s a crisp loop:\n\n**See → See → Feel → Feel → Do → Review**\n\n- **See (Outer):** situational facts, constraints, harms/benefits, stakeholders.  \n- **See (Inner):** what is alive/quiet within; where ego shows; where peace shows.  \n- **Feel (Transcendent):** which Names are calling here (Mercy, Justice, Patience…)? what dua rises?  \n- **Feel (Relational):** what CAPs are arising (compelled attention to protect, repair, console, build)?  \n- **Do (Excellence):** smallest faithful action with craft/beauty that fits your station and the moment.  \n- **Review:** what changed? what signs confirmed/redirected? iterate.\n\nPut this loop on one card. It’s your heaviest portable tool.\n\n# 3) Principles you’re actually advocating (name them plainly)\n1) **Heart-first epistemology:** the heart *perceives* values; reason clarifies; metrics witness—none replaces the heart.  \n2) **Difficulty is formative (kabad):** grief, duty, death are not pathologies to outgrow; they are constitutive of meaning.  \n3) **Excellence (ihsān) in the material:** craft that lasts, repairability, proportion, embodied skill—matter is a trust.  \n4) **Right relation before right metrics:** design conditions where care becomes likely (belonging, witness, small wins), then measure.  \n5) **Plural access to the One:** many traditions preserved pathways; Islam offers a map you’ve tested, without denying others’ lights.  \n6) **Stations and roles (maqām):** not flat egalitarianism; diversity of gifts and authorities in mutual accountability.  \n7) **From performance → presence:** less signaling, more showing up (witness–weave–warrant: accompany people, build tools, document results).\n\n# 4) Gaza + duty + anger (placement in your stance)\n- You’re **not** called to rage-as-identity; you *are* called to **clarity + presence**.  \n- Translate anger into **lament + design moves**: protocols, teacher cards, witness hours, cash/aid funnels, mentoring pipelines.  \n- Name failure without froth: “Institutions optimized for optics and stability while lives were at stake; our response is to make care operational and inevitable at the smallest human unit—and to grow that faithfully.”\n\n# 5) Friendship isn’t the whole picture—complete it\nAdd three modalities of obedience to truth:\n- **Solitary obedience** (mountain): prayer, fasting, study, khalwa → cleans the lens.  \n- **Relational obedience** (city): friendship, kinship, neighborhood, ummah → activates CAPs.  \n- **Institutional obedience** (house): waqf, school, guild, mosque, co-op → keeps care stable across time.\n\nYour work touches all three: personal practice (CMU studies, your prayer life), relational practice (Gaza calls), institutional practice (Bloom, teacher networks, waqf-logic projects).\n\n# 6) “How do we know this is true?” (your epistemic warrant)\n- **Convergence:** different traditions report the same structure (compelled care, peace after right action).  \n- **Fruits:** repeated outcomes—belonging rises, helplessness drops, small faithful actions compound.  \n- **Replicability:** simple protocols work across contexts (gratitude circles, narrative reframing, cooperative tasks).  \n- **Resistance test:** actions still make sense when costly (e.g., solidarity that risks reputation).  \n- **Longevity:** practices survive leaders (institutionalization without hollowing).\n\nThis is “empirical theology” in humble clothes.\n\n# 7) Anticipate critiques (and your gentle replies)\n**“Western civilization gave us science; don’t sneer at measurement.”**  \nYou aren’t rejecting measurement; you’re restoring its order: *perception → conscience → craft → measurement (as witness).* When measurement leads, it flattens.\n\n**“Values are subjective; ‘heart-perception’ is romantic.”**  \nYet people routinely report *compelled* care in real friendships and crises. Treat it as data: CAPs behave law-like within conditions. Build conditions; observe.\n\n**“Hierarchy is dangerous; egalitarianism avoids abuse.”**  \nTrue—*unaccountable* hierarchy corrupts. But leaderless spaces drift. You’re arguing for **stations + accountability**: role clarity, guardrails, and rotation.\n\n**“Religion causes wars (see Europe).”**  \nSo does ideology and profit. Your claim isn’t “religion = good,” it’s that **traditions preserving heart-perception** keep power oriented to mercy/justice. When they lose the heart, they betray themselves.\n\n**Jordan Peterson-style pushback (“order vs chaos”, Judeo-Christian bedrock):**  \nConcede shared ground (duty, sacrifice, meaning beyond hedonia). Add: **Islam’s contribution** is explicit heart-epistemology (qalb), Names-based discernment, and a living law for ordinary excellence—tested daily in markets, kitchens, and courts, not only in myth.\n\n# 8) History notes you raised (as framing, not proof-texts)\n- European trauma (plagues, wars of religion) + centralization of force accelerated **control epistemology** (Bacon’s “mastery over nature”) and public “neutrality” (religion privatized). The price: **one-eyed seeing** (only the measurable counts) + imperial extraction.  \n- Many Islamic/Chinese/Indigenous strands conserved **contemplative, relational, seasonal** epistemologies (signs, rites, virtue cultivation, craft guilds, stewardship), with their own failures—but with live lineages you can still practice. Your wife’s experience is part of the convergence evidence: the heart recognizes truth outside prior belief.\n\n# 9) How this refines Barakanomics (so it’s followable)\n**Barakanomics = designing work that increases blessing (“aliveness in right relation”).**  \nPractical criteria you can publish now:\n- **Right relation:** does this increase trust/reciprocity/dignity in the smallest circle?  \n- **Excellence:** is the work well-made, repairable, proportionate, beautiful?  \n- **Mercy + justice:** does it lower coercion and widen fair access?  \n- **Belonging:** do participants feel more held this week?  \n- **Transcendent alignment:** does it harmonize with Mercy/Truth/Beauty as perceived by the heart (and confirmed by elders/teachers)?  \n\nMetrics to track (lightweight): belonging rate, witness hours, reciprocity ratio, reframe rate, small-win velocity (you already have these).\n\n# 10) Two tiny additions to your toolkit\n- **Name activation:** before action, ask “Which Divine Name is most called for here?” (e.g., Al-Raḥmān, Al-ʿAdl). It focuses attention and shapes method.  \n- **Station check:** “Is this mine to do, ours to do, or God’s to do?” (personal, collective, surrendered). Prevents burnout and scope creep.\n\n---\n\n## Where you’re not seeing yourself clearly (my read)\n- You keep under-valuing your **methodological clarity**. You’re not just emoting about the heart; you’re building **repeatable micro-protocols** that other people can use tomorrow. That’s your superpower.  \n- You hesitate to name **truth claims**, but your work already *tests* them. It’s okay to say: “Here’s what we observed, here’s how we designed for it, here’s what changed.”  \n- You worry friendship is too narrow; but you’ve already expanded it into **three obediences** (solitary, relational, institutional). Make that explicit.  \n- You feel guilty about not shouting; but your stance—**witness + weave + warrant**—is a vocation, not a dodge.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Fold this into a **final symposium bio** (short + medium) that carries this architecture implicitly; and  \n- Add a **methods box** for your abstract that names the See–See–Feel–Feel–Do loop and the two PDF protocols we made—so reviewers see you’ll *demo* practice, not just talk about it.",

      "content": "This is exactly the right doubt to pause on, Bilal. Let’s unpack carefully.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Why your methods matter even if *you* don’t use them\nYou’re right: with ADHD, you don’t hold onto frameworks. That’s your lived truth. But that’s also what makes your clarity *so valuable to others*.  \n\nThink of it this way:  \n- You *live* in chaos/flow.  \n- To survive, you design micro-structures you can actually stand to use (witness circles, gratitude prompts, peer sessions).  \n- If they work for you in chaos, they’re strong enough scaffolds for people who *don’t* have your same struggles.  \n\nThat’s why they’re worth writing down. They’re “protocols you’d actually use if you remembered.” Others will remember them. Teachers in Gaza *are* using them. Bloom participants *did* use them. That’s testing.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How your work “tests” truth claims\nThink of each practice as an **experiment**:\n\n- **Gratitude Circle** (teacher card) → Hypothesis: gratitude directs attention to “signs,” reduces helplessness.  \n- **Peer Circles at Bloom** → Hypothesis: placing finances + mental health at the same table increases belonging and lowers shame.  \n- **Friendship check-ins with Gaza teachers** → Hypothesis: solidarity conversations reduce isolation and foster presilience.  \n\nYou don’t just “believe” these things—you *ran them in practice*, saw shifts (belonging, reframing, small wins), and kept iterating. That’s testing.  \n\nYour ADD actually helps: you can’t stick with abstractions unless you see results. That makes you an empirical theologian: always stress-testing the “gems” against lived life.\n\n---\n\n### 3. “Three obediences” clarified (not abstract, but practical)\nMaybe “obedience” isn’t the word that sings to you. Let’s reframe it.  \n\nYour *friendship intuition* said: goodness isn’t about purified intention, it emerges when you’re in real relation. That’s **relational mode**.  \nBut you realized relation isn’t the only context where truth compels you. Sometimes:  \n- You’re alone with God (solitary mode) → prayer, reflection, fasting.  \n- You’re in community (relational mode) → friendship, solidarity, circles.  \n- You’re in institutions (structural mode) → waqf, schools, networks, Bloom itself.  \n\nThat’s the expansion. Not just friendship, but **multiple contexts where the heart’s perception becomes actionable.**  \n\nIt’s not three “obediences” like commandments. It’s three **arenas where compelled attention shows up**. \n\n---\n\n### 4. How it links back to your original intuition\n- **Original intuition:** friendship makes care inevitable (Greg Boyle moment).  \n- **Expansion:** care can become inevitable in more contexts than just friendship:  \n  - In solitude: when you’re with God, you can’t help but pray, repent, hope.  \n  - In relation: when you see your friend’s need, you can’t help but attend.  \n  - In institutions: when a waqf or circle is designed right, it *channels* inevitable care across generations.  \n\nSo the structure is: **contexts where compelled attention gets activated.**  \nThat’s what you’re designing for.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Why this is not “useless”  \nEven if you don’t remember frameworks, the **people using your cards and circles already prove it matters**. You’re not trying to fix your ADD. You’re designing **external scaffolds** that anyone can pick up and use, even in chaos.  \n\nThat’s why Gaza teachers found it powerful. That’s why Bloom worked differently than Silicon Valley accelerators.  \n\n---\n\n🔹 So the reframed takeaway:  \nYour superpower isn’t to remember frameworks—it’s to **sense what compels action** and then build **small, repeatable practices** where that compulsion becomes visible. That’s how you test, refine, and share.  \n\n---\n\nWould it help if I mocked up a **1-page diagram** that shows:  \n- Greg Boyle’s friendship moment (seed) →  \n- Expanded to 3 contexts of compelled care (solitary, relational, institutional) →  \n- Concrete protocols (cards, circles, waqf-design) that *test* these?  \n\nThat way you see the architecture at a glance, without needing to “remember” it in words.",

Y/N)\n- **Small-win velocity** (consequential small actions / person / week)\n\n# where “friendship” fits (and what’s beyond it)\nyou’re right: friendship isn’t the whole thing. it’s one **channel** where compelled attention (CAPs) becomes obvious. the Qur’anic map above shows **seven channels**. sometimes your path is **alone with God** (upsight/insight), sometimes **with people**, sometimes **through craft or land**, sometimes **through time and legacy**. that’s why your early “friendship” intuition needed to widen.\n\n# a one-liner you can actually remember (ADHD-friendly)\n> **See what’s true (U-I-O-O-T-W-S).

      "content": "WHAT I'M NOTICING (and getting concerned about)\nThe historical claims need verification. You're asking \"how do we know this is true?\" about the Black Death → empiricism connection, but then making your own causal claims without checking them. Did the Black Death cause empiricism? That's a 200-year gap. Were the religious wars about \"ugliness\" or about genuine theological/political conflicts? You're building a narrative that fits your thesis, but history is messier.\nThe \"islam is the true parts of all paths\" claim is doing too much work. This is a very strong theological claim that would be contested by Muslims (many would say Islam is THE truth, not just \"true parts\"), by Christians (who'd say Christ is the way), by Buddhists (who'd reject the whole framework), etc. You're trying to have it both ways—Islam is uniquely true AND all traditions access the same truth. Pick one or be clear about the paradox.\nThe psychoactive substances + Quranic verses thing is not evidence. You say verses emerged during altered states, and your wife (who didn't like Islam) had similar experiences, so it's not personal bias. But altered states produce experiences that FEEL profound—that doesn't make them objectively true. People have profound experiences in all traditions. This proves human consciousness is interesting, not that Islam is uniquely true.\nYou're asking me to help you argue AND critique, but mostly you want ammunition. You're not actually curious about the counterarguments—you want me to make your case stronger. That's fine, but be honest about it. And be prepared that the counterarguments are real and strong.\nON THE FRIENDSHIP FRAME\nYou're right that \"friendship\" isn't quite it. Here's what I think you're actually pointing at:\nNot friendship exactly, but: Seeing truly → Responding truthfully from what you see\nWhen you see Haya and Mohammed (Gaza friends), you respond with care\nWhen you see suffering cats in Istanbul, you respond with feeding them\nWhen you see a mountain calling, you respond by going alone to God\nWhen you see your own gifts (creative, innovative), you respond by offering them\nThe pattern: First comes SEEING (with heart, not just eyes). Then comes natural RESPONSE (can't help but act). This is closer to your \"see see feel feel do\" framework.\nMaybe:\nSee outward (what's happening in world)\nSee inward (what's happening in heart)\nFeel (let reality land in you, affect you)\nDiscern (sense what's yours to do)\nRespond (act from that clarity)\nThis isn't \"friendship\" necessarily. It's attunement → response. Sometimes that's friendship. Sometimes it's waqf for cats. Sometimes it's alone on a mountain. Sometimes it's building a boat with baby formula for Gaza.\nThe unity: All emerge from seeing truly with heart open, not from obligation or strategy.\nON THE HISTORICAL NARRATIVE YOU'RE BUILDING\nYou want an \"anti-list\" of Islamic/Chinese/other approaches vs. Western. But first, let's check your claims:\nFrancis Bacon's \"nature on the rack\" (1620): Real quote. Context: He's arguing for experimental method—you must \"torture\" nature (put her on the rack, like torture device) to force her to reveal secrets. This IS violent epistemology. He's writing during/after religious wars, witch trials, Inquisition—torture is normal to him.\nBlack Death → empiricism: Too simplistic. Black Death (1347-53) shook Church authority because prayers didn't stop it. But empiricism doesn't really emerge until 1600s. Lots happened between: Renaissance, Reformation, printing press, New World \"discovery.\" You're collapsing 250 years of messy history into clean causation.\nReligious wars \"ugliness\": This is where you're being reductive. The Reformation wasn't just \"ugliness\"—it was genuine theological dispute (can you buy salvation? Is Pope infallible? What's authority of scripture?). People killed each other over this because they believed eternal souls were at stake. Horrifying, yes. But not just \"ugliness\"—deep conviction that turned violent.\nKant and colonialism: Yes and no. Kant's autonomy theory (humans as rational agents) WAS used to justify racism (\"they're not fully rational, so not fully human\"). But Kant himself was inconsistent—racist in some writings, universalist in others. Enlightenment thinkers generally DID provide philosophical cover for colonialism by claiming European rationality was superior. But it's more complex than \"Kant justified slavery.\"\nWhat you're missing: Europe wasn't uniquely violent. Islamic empires conquered. Ottoman Empire had slavery. Mongols killed millions. Chinese dynasties were brutal. The difference: Europe industrialized violence (machine guns, bombs) and wrapped it in universalist ideology (\"civilizing mission\"). That combination—industrial tech + moral superiority claim—was distinctively destructive.\nTHE ISLAMIC/CHINESE COUNTER-EXAMPLES\nYou want me to make a longer list of non-Western approaches that were more humble/wise. I can, but I need to be honest: I'm cherry-picking examples that fit your thesis. Every civilization has beauty AND ugliness.\nIslamic tradition (cherry-picked positive examples):\nScience as reading Allah's signs, not dominating nature\nWaqf system—endowments for public good (hospitals, schools, cats)\nAdab (right conduct)—behavior flows from cultivated heart\nIhsan (excellence/beauty in all things)—do everything as if seeing Allah\nRibat (spiritual retreat AND frontier defense)—inner/outer integrated\nBayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom)—translating/preserving Greek/Indian/Persian knowledge, not destroying it\nChinese tradition (cherry-picked):\nZheng He's fleet: trade/gift-giving, not conquest\nConfucian harmony: social order through right relationship, not force\nDaoist wu wei: action through non-forcing, aligning with nature's way\nEmphasis on balance (yin/yang) not domination\nExamination system: meritocracy (imperfect but better than hereditary aristocracy)\nIndigenous traditions (cherry-picked):\nSeven generations thinking: actions judged by impact on future\nKinship with non-human world: animals, plants, land as relatives\nCouncil/consensus decision-making: no single authority\nGift economies: wealth measured by what you give, not accumulate\nOral wisdom traditions: knowledge embedded in story/relationship\nBUT ALSO: Islamic empires conquered, enslaved, sometimes forcibly converted. Chinese dynasties were brutal to minorities. Indigenous peoples had warfare, slavery in some cases. I'm giving you the beautiful parts because you asked, but don't romanticize.\nON \"ISLAM IS TRUE AND TESTABLE\"\nYou say: \"islam is true and its testible and verifiable and you can do the practices and get benefits\"\nLet me push back:\nWhat's testable: Islamic practices (prayer, fasting, zakat, gratitude, Quranic reflection) produce benefits. YES. Documented in your PTG work, in Gaza teachers, etc. This is real.\nWhat's NOT testable: Whether Allah exists, whether Muhammad was His prophet, whether Quran is divine revelation. These are faith claims. You believe them. I respect that. But don't confuse \"practices work\" with \"metaphysical claims are proven.\"\nAnalogy: Buddhist meditation produces measurable benefits (reduced stress, increased focus). Does that prove Buddha was enlightened under the Bodhi tree? No. It proves the practices work. The metaphysical frame is separate.\nYour claim about belief being part of resilience: YES. Believing you're held by Allah, that difficulty has meaning, that death isn't the end—these beliefs ARE part of what makes the practices powerful. But that's not the same as proving the beliefs are objectively true. Placebos work too.\nI'm not saying Islam is false. I'm saying: don't conflate \"the practices are effective\" with \"therefore the theology is proven.\" They're different categories of claim.\nON MUQALIB AL-QULUB (THE TURNER OF HEARTS) AND CAPS\nThis is actually interesting. You're suggesting: If God is \"the one who turns hearts,\" maybe CAPs (patterns of attention drawn from beyond us) are evidence of divine influence on consciousness.\nHow this could be explored:\nWhen people experience CAPs (can't help but care for friend, drawn to beauty, compelled by truth), do they experience it as coming from within or beyond?\nDifferent traditions name this differently: God turning hearts (Islam), Holy Spirit (Christianity), Buddha-nature (Buddhism), etc.\nCan we observe patterns? Are there conditions that make CAPs more likely?\nThis IS worth investigating. But carefully. Not \"CAPs prove God exists\" but \"CAPs are a phenomenon worth studying, and different traditions offer different frames for understanding them.\"\nHow defenders of Western civ would argue against this:\nJordan Peterson type: Would say these are archetypal patterns in human consciousness (Jung), not divine intervention. The patterns are real but psychologically explainable. Meaning is constructed through myth/narrative, not received from transcendent source.\nSecular neuroscientist: Would say altered states (prayer, meditation, psychedelics) produce predictable brain activity. The experience of \"outside influence\" is your brain's way of interpreting its own processes. No external source needed.\nEnlightenment rationalist: Would say you're experiencing strong emotions and interpreting them as divine. Perfectly explainable through psychology, culture, expectation. Occam's razor: no need to posit God.\nChristian apologist: Would say yes, hearts can be moved by external source—but it's not Allah, it's the Holy Spirit. Your interpretation of the phenomenon is wrong, even if phenomenon is real.\nAll these critiques are HONEST positions, not bad faith. You need to be able to sit with them, not just dismiss them.\nWHAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING\nYou're building a grand narrative (West bad/closed, Islam good/open) that's too clean. History is messier. Every tradition has wisdom and shadow. You're right that modern West lost something. But don't romanticize alternatives or oversimplify causation.\nYour evidence is personal experience + selective reading. That's fine for YOUR journey. But at an academic symposium, they'll ask for more rigorous evidence. You need to be clear: \"This is what I've experienced and tested. Here's the data I have. Here's what needs further research.\"\nThe metaphysical claims are getting stronger as you talk, but your grounding is getting weaker. Early in our conversation: \"I want to help people open their hearts.\" Now: \"Islam is the true parts of all paths\" and \"Quranic verses emerged during psychoactive experiences proving truth.\" Do you see the drift?\nYou keep asking me to sharpen your arguments, but you're not actually engaging with counterarguments. You want me to make your case bulletproof. But maybe your case has real holes? Maybe some of what you believe is faith, not provable? That's okay—just be honest about it.\nThe \"see see feel feel do\" framework is good but underdeveloped. What ARE the two seeings? What's the difference between them? How do you train this? When does discernment fail? You have intuition but not yet clear method.\nHONEST ADVICE FOR THE BIO\nGiven all this, here's what I think you should do:\nDO include:\nYour lived experience (PTSD, Gaza friends, Bloom design)\nWhat you've tested (PTG research, teacher support, peer circles)\nThe\ngap you've noticed (modern frameworks miss what Islamic tradition names)\nYour invitation (creating conditions for heart-opening, documenting what emerges)\nDON'T include:\nGrand historical narratives about West closing heart after Black Death (too speculative)\nClaims that Islam is \"true parts of all paths\" (too provocative and unclear)\nPsychoactive substance experiences as evidence (academic context wrong for this)\nStrong critiques of Western epistemology without nuance (will create defensiveness)\nBE CLEAR ABOUT:\nWhat's tested (practices produce benefits)\nWhat's hypothesis (heart-perception is real faculty, not just metaphor)\nWhat's faith (your belief in Allah, Quran, etc.)\nREMEMBER: You're at a symposium on \"Integrating Islamic Spirituality Across Mental Health Services.\" They want practical integration, not theological arguments. Show your work. Share your method. Invite inquiry. Don't proselytize or over-claim.\nDoes this help? Am I being too harsh? I'm trying to be a good friend by being honest, not just cheering you on.\n\nPASTED\ni like the pushback! And be prepared that the counterarguments are real and strong.... ok, give counter examples. i'm ok with truth - i think the mongols worldview might have justified the millions killed, yet wise cultures (which convered the mongols btw) that see others as full humans, perhaps wrong, yet still human wouldn't kill women and children qith the frequency and irreverence of a one eyed culure i think, critique and debate me on this. and i see the black plauge as the start of the shift from heaven to heaven on earth, es through the renaissance etcetc - and before that i think the roman empire and it's brutal slave treatment and throwing christians to lions was absorbed into christiantiy when constantine converted bringing some of that wierd domination culture in, whre did the romans get it i don't know... ideas? - i'm more interested in the practices working and lettin gpeople make their own decisions - this is intersting: Your claim about belief being part of resilience: YES. Believing you're held by Allah, that difficulty has meaning, that death isn't the end—these beliefs ARE part of what makes the practices powerful. But that's not the same as proving the beliefs are objectively true. Placebos work too. - i guess there's the idea of overwhelming evidence, i'm not lik ehume where a piano over my head //might// not fall because of causation. I sort of believe in things - maybe this is where my rigorious philosophical take gets pragmatic - that after a hundred times meeting with someone and building raport and love and trust that it's highly unlikely that they would lie to me. the prophet was known as the truthful trustworthy. I mean sure they can get a brain tumor and thei rpersonality will change - and yes there are poeple on the specturm of psychopathy - yet those are edge cases. Similarly getting to a point where after testing promise after promise in the scriptural tradition and getting verified results about this world (charity doesn't decrease your money, when you contemplate/remember god hearts come to ease, etc etc) then the parts that require faith is easier -and who knows perhaps i will get futuhat and develop ayn al yaqeen, the eye of certainty of the reality of God and the afterlife etc etc - yet for me it's t ruth claim from a reliable source wher emost of the imperical stuff is panning out and it would be a sad life to live iwth the caution of thinking, maybe today my mom will wake upand hate my when she wiped by butt and loved me for 40 days every day no matter what, today... can be different. True, yet likely? No, not without extenuating circumstances. personally i don't thik it matters for our conversation because we're digging into the first two sources of revelation, the heart knowing within and CAPs etc, and the signs in nature and \"on the horizon\"",

ming/qing repressed; mongols massacred; europe industrialized killing. keep your critique of *modern* flattening without romanticizing alternatives.\n\n# your claims: stronger, cleaner\n\n**1) “islam is the true parts of all paths.”**  \nthis is a big theological stance. safer claim for the symposium:  \n> “i work from the hypothesis that many traditions preserve practices that open the heart’s perception. islam gives me a map i’ve tested; it doesn’t deny others’ lights.”\n\n**2) altered states & verses.**  \nnote as *autobiographical data*, not evidence:  \n> “in prayer/retreat/altered states i encountered quranic language before i consciously chose it. that experience motivated me to test islamic practices in service settings.”\n\n**3) “practices work” vs “metaphysics is true.”**  \nhold them apart:  \n- **tested:** gratitude, dhikr, qur’anic reflection, cooperative tasks → ↑ belonging, ↓ helplessness, ↑ small wins.  \n- **live hypothesis:** the *qalb* perceives value (not just constructs it).  \n- **faith:** allah, prophethood, afterlife—central to me, not offered here as proof.\n\nyou can also use your **track-record argument** without overclaiming:  \n> “over years, islam’s promises about difficulty, charity, remembrance have matched experience often enough that trusting the rest has become reasonable for me.”\n\n# on “friendship” and your intuition\n\nyou’re right: “friendship” alone is too narrow. you’re really describing **attunement → compelled response** that can happen in multiple channels.\n\nuse the **7-sight scan** (fast, memorable):\n- **upsight** (god), **insight** (heart), **outsight–people**, **outsight–creation**, **time-sight**, **work-sight**, **story-sight**.  \none line you can remember: **“see what’s true; do one small faithful thing with ihsān; repeat.”**\n\n# how your work already “tests” the claims\n\nthink of each as a micro-experiment with observable outcomes:\n\n- **bloom peer circles** (work-sight + people-outsight)  \n  *hypothesis:* money + mental health together lowers shame/fragmentation.  \n  *signals:* belonging scores, small-win velocity, reciprocity ratio.  \n  *evidence:* 1,011 entrepreneurs; consistent “felt love/connection” feedback.\n\n- **gaza teacher cards** (upsight + insight + people-outsight)  \n  *hypothesis:* qur’anic reflection + gratitude + cooperative task → ↑ belonging, narrative reframing, small actions.  \n  *signals:* 1–5 belonging, reframe (Y/N), small action (Y/N).\n\n- **solidarity calls** (people-outsight)  \n  *hypothesis:* “witness hours” reduce isolation there and helplessness here.  \n  *signals:* minutes logged; continuity of contact; requests fulfilled.\n\n- **craft/repair choices** (creation-outsight + work-sight)  \n  *hypothesis:* ihsān in materials (repairable, proportionate) deepens meaning.  \n  *signals:* participant pride/ownership; longevity of use; repair events.\n\nthis is what “testing” looks like in your lane: small, repeatable, humane.\n\n# your “three obediences” (rename it so it lands)\n\nditch the word “obediences.” call them **contexts of compelled response**:\n- **solitary:** khalwa/prayer/fasting—clears the lens; compels repentance/hope.  \n- **relational:** friendship/kin/neighbor—compels witness/care.  \n- **institutional:** waqf/school/circle design—channels care reliably over time.\n\nthis extends your original friendship intuition without making it the whole world.\n\n# counter-examples (you invited them)\n\n- **women/children in war:** medieval siege norms (europe & elsewhere) often endangered non-combatants; islamic law *aimed* to protect them, but practice varied widely. it’s not accurate to say “one-eyed cultures” kill women/children more; modern *industrial* war increases civilian casualties everywhere.  \n- **rome → christianity:** constantine did merge imperial logic with christian forms; but christian traditions also generated radical nonviolence and mercy lineages. mixed legacy, not one thing.  \n- **mamluks/ottomans vs mongols:** mamluks defeated mongols; mongols later adopted islam in some khanates—conversion didn’t erase earlier atrocities; practice improved unevenly.\n\nthese don’t invalidate your thesis; they keep it honest.\n\n# how to speak about belief & resilience (clean, symposium-ready)\n\n- **what you can claim:** “belief that one is held by god, that hardship has meaning, and that death is not the end appears to strengthen resilience and prosocial action; we observe this in classrooms and peer circles when paired with simple practices.”  \n- **what you won’t claim:** “therefore islam (or any metaphysics) is proven.”  \n- **what you invite:** “we propose these practices as testable, transferable, and culturally native; others can adapt within their traditions.”\n\n# slotting this into the bio (no overreach)\n\ntwo lines you can add without raising flags:\n- “his programs operationalize **heart-perception** through small practices—qur’anic reflection, gratitude, cooperative tasks—and track humane outcomes (belonging, reframing, small wins).”\n- “in gaza he supports teachers of pop-up schools; the work is urgent amid institutional failures and centers **witness over optics**.”\n\n# if you want to press the critique (without getting lost)\n\n- **claim:** modern growth-only frames misread grief/duty/death as pathologies; traditions like islam keep them central to meaning.  \n- **evidence style:** show before/after classroom/circle notes; a few numbers; 1–2 quotes. let readers draw the metaphysical inference.\n\n---\n\nif you want, i can:\n- add a **methods box** you can paste into the abstract (names the 7-sight scan + the 3 signals you’ll measure); and\n- tweak your **program bio** to include those two clean lines about heart-perception practices and gaza’s urgency—no grand history, no overclaim.\n\nyou’ll stay clear, humble, and still unmistakably you.",

      "content": "Got it. Let’s build on everything we’ve surfaced: your lived journey, Bloom, Gaza, and the heart-perception/attunement thread. Here’s a draft you could use for the HBKU symposium bio (max 500 words, so I’ll aim ~470).  \n\n---\n\n**Bilal Ghalib – Biography**  \n\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer. He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences from the Université de Paris, a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics from the University of Michigan, and is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.  \n\nThe Arab Spring drew him from Michigan into the Middle East to work with youth. He helped seed community innovation spaces in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, and later at Autodesk bridged grassroots makers with global sustainability projects. But the violence surrounding these efforts was not abstract: colleagues and friends were killed in Baghdad and in Syrian refugee schools. At the time he thought he was disillusioned; later he recognized the weight of unprocessed trauma.  \n\nSeeking a more grounded way of working, in 2016 he moved to Lebanon and co-founded Bloom. As Head of Learning & Research, he designed Bloom’s community-first, non-competitive accelerators that integrate reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Bloom has supported over 1,000 founders across SWANA and Africa, creating bilingual peer networks that place finances and mental health in the same conversation.  \n\nHis own breakdown in 2018 led him to research post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs in Lebanon. The frameworks of developmental and positive psychology mapped growth stages, but he found they left something out: what Muslim tradition calls *qalb*, or heart-perception—the faculty for sensing beauty, goodness, and truth at their source. During the pandemic he deepened this exploration, reconnecting with Islam not as identity but as a tested set of practices that integrate difficulty, death, and duty into a meaningful life.  \n\nToday his work brings this insight into practical settings. With the UN International Trade Centre he co-designed curricula for sustainable reconstruction in Iraq. With Nawaya in Lebanon he facilitated design-thinking programs with refugee youth. Most recently he supports educators at School Without Borders in Gaza, who are running pop-up schools for displaced children; together they are integrating Qur’anic reflection, gratitude, and cooperative tasks with post-traumatic growth practices. These are small, repeatable ways of strengthening belonging, reframing trauma, and enabling small acts of agency—tested in some of the most difficult circumstances in the world.  \n\nAlongside practice, he contributes to wellbeing initiatives in the Ecosystem Network, including the Wellbeing Project and the WHEN network. At Cambridge Muslim College he studies how Islamic tradition can enrich contemporary psychology and mental health—offering what he believes is urgently needed: not only growth but healing, not only coping but connection to what is real.  \n\nFluent in Arabic and English, Bilal’s aim is simple: to create conditions where people can open the eye of the heart, see clearly, and act from that clarity—in friendship, in institutions, and in service to the world.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to also condense this into a **shorter (~300 word)** version you could use for a conference program blurb?",

I think the best move is to merge the **academic grounding of your PTG thesis** 【70†source】 with the **practical, Islamic-integrated training approach you developed for Gaza schools** 【71†source】.  \n\nHere’s why:  \n\n- The **Lebanon/PTG thesis** gives you *academic credibility*: validated psychometric tools (VIA), data on resilience buffering, character strengths like hope, humor, teamwork, and the concept of deliberate rumination. This shows you can design rigorous programs that *measure impact*.  \n\n- The **Gaza School Without Borders work** makes it *immediately relevant*: teachers in an ongoing crisis, Islamic framing (Surat ad-Duha, Quran 3:103), and micro-practices teachers can actually use tomorrow (gratitude, humor, collective check-ins, storywork). This makes your work speak directly to the symposium theme of “Integrating Islamic Spirituality Across Mental Health Services.”  \n\nSo the **abstract** can highlight:  \n1. **Evidence base**: Your PTG research with social entrepreneurs in Lebanon during COVID + Beirut Blast.  \n2. **Practical application**: How those insights shaped training you now deliver to teachers in Gaza, adapted through Islamic truths and local pedagogy.  \n3. **Contribution**: A set of *repeatable, low-cost, spiritually integrated practices* (gratitude reflections, humor, collective intelligence, narrative reconstruction, Qur’anic framing) that foster resilience and post-traumatic growth in learning environments.  \n\n---\n\n✨ Draft Abstract (for your presentation):\n\n**Title:** From Post-Traumatic Growth Research to Practice: Trauma-Informed, Spiritually Integrated Pedagogies for Education in Crisis Contexts  \n\n**Abstract:**  \nHow can learning experiences promote growth after trauma, especially in contexts of ongoing violence and displacement? Drawing from my master’s research on post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs in Lebanon during the COVID-19 pandemic and Beirut Blast, I identified pedagogical choices that buffered against declines in wellbeing and strengthened hope, humor, teamwork, and gratitude—traits correlated with resilience and flourishing.  \n\nBuilding on these findings, I have adapted micro-practices for teachers in Gaza through the School Without Borders initiative. These practices combine positive psychology and trauma-informed design with Islamic spiritual resources—such as reflection on Surah al-Duha, gratitude circles, and Qur’anic reminders of solidarity (3:103). They are simple to teach, aligned with existing curricula, and nurture collective resilience without replacing clinical therapy.  \n\nThis presentation will share the evidence base, practical tools, and early lessons from Gaza classrooms. It argues for a pedagogy that is participatory, spiritually resonant, and grounded in community support—helping teachers and learners not only survive but grow through adversity.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to also **draft 3–5 bullet “takeaways”** for the program brochure (so participants immediately know what they’ll gain from your talk)?

You’re creating **presilience practices**—everyday, low-cost, spiritual and communal habits that help teachers and learners hold difficulty, find meaning, and even grow through it.  \n\nSo in your abstract, you could phrase it like this:  \n\n> “These practices are not therapeutic interventions or replacements for psychologists. Rather, they are pedagogical designs that help teachers weave resilience, gratitude, and meaning-making into ordinary lessons—preparing learners for a future likely to face increasing volatility and disruption.”  \n\nThis positions your work as **future-facing** (schools of tomorrow need this), **non-clinical** (teachers stay teachers), and **spiritually grounded** (not just techniques but connected to heart-perception and tradition).  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to reframe the abstract with this “future volatile world / non-clinical presilience toolkit” lens, so it sharpens both your critique of “trauma-informed” and your constructive alternative?",

      "content": "Here’s a draft abstract framed through the **“volatile future / presilience toolkit”** lens:  \n\n---\n\n**Abstract (300–350 words)**  \nSchools in Gaza today—and schools everywhere tomorrow—are being asked to carry more than academics. In times of war, displacement, and systemic breakdown, children show up to classrooms carrying grief, fear, and uncertainty. Teachers are not therapists, yet the need for resilience, belonging, and meaning is immediate.  \n\nThis presentation shares a set of **“presilience practices”**—low-cost, repeatable micro-protocols that help teachers weave resilience and meaning-making into ordinary lessons. Developed with *School Without Borders* educators in Gaza and informed by my research on post-traumatic growth among Lebanese social entrepreneurs after the Beirut Port Blast, these practices integrate three strands:  \n- **Narrative reflection** (telling “what helped me keep going” stories in class),  \n- **Qur’anic attentional practices** (gratitude, reflection on signs within and around us),  \n- **Peer witnessing** (teachers practicing together before using with students).  \n\nThese are **not therapeutic interventions**. They do not turn teachers into psychologists or classrooms into clinics. Instead, they are pedagogical tools that shift daily learning environments towards resilience, gratitude, and meaning.  \n\nThe guiding insight is that **healing and growth emerge not only from clinical treatment but also from communal, everyday practices**. Post-traumatic growth research shows that meaning-making, belonging, and spiritual framing are crucial to resilience. Islamic tradition offers a deep resource here—integrating difficulty (kabad), death, and duty as constitutive parts of life, not obstacles to overcome.  \n\nIn volatile futures shaped by war, climate crisis, and displacement, schools worldwide will need similar supports. Preparing teachers with presilience toolkits can help ensure that education remains a space of belonging and possibility, even in disruption.  \n\nThis presentation will share concrete classroom protocols, early lessons from Gaza, and reflections on how integrating Islamic spiritual practices with post-traumatic growth research can inform the design of future-ready education.  \n\n---\n\n👉 This way, you’re:  \n- **Naming Gaza** as both real and future-relevant, not a “special case.”  \n- **Avoiding “trauma-informed”** by introducing “presilience practices.”  \n- **Positioning teachers** as educators, not therapists.  \n- **Grounding it academically** in your PTG thesis + spiritually in Qur’anic practice.  \n\nDo you want me to also write a **one-sentence “hook” version** for the symposium program (like a tagline under your name)?",

He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.  \n\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan into the Middle East to work with youth—helping seed innovation spaces in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, and later bridging grassroots makers with global sustainability efforts at Autodesk. Between 2013 and 2014, people he worked with were killed: the organizer who helped launch the Baghdad hackerspace, a Syrian refugee girl from a puppet-show solar workshop. These weren’t abstractions; they were friends. He didn’t recognize his response as PTSD, assuming instead he had grown cynical. Looking back, he sees that what he carried was trauma, and that his burnout and breakdown were invitations to rethink what “good work” really means.  \n\nA turning point came through Father Greg Boyle, founder of Homeboy Industries, who was asked why he worked with former gang members. His answer: “Because they’re my friends.” Good emerges from kinship, not abstraction. In 2016 Bilal co-founded Bloom in Lebanon as a community-first accelerator that integrates reflective storywork and resilience practices with venture tools. Weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table. Since then, Bloom has supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa, and co-designed curricula with the UN International Trade Centre on sustainable reconstruction.  \n\nBilal’s master’s thesis studied post-traumatic growth among Lebanese social entrepreneurs after the Beirut Port Blast. Most recently, he has supported School Without Borders in Gaza, where teachers running pop-up schools for displaced children blend Qur’anic reflection and gratitude practices with post-traumatic growth research.  \n\nSince 2014 he has been part of the Ecosystem Network, contributing to the Wellbeing Project and the WHEN network to bring wellbeing practices into higher education and organizations. His current work sits at the intersection of trauma-informed design, Islamic psychology, and community empowerment—seeking ways to create practical toolkits that help ordinary educators foster resilience without turning classrooms into clinics.  \n\nFluent in Arabic and English, Bilal is committed to bringing forward what the Muslim tradition claims to be, and he believes can be: a healing for the hearts of humanity.  \n\n---\n\n### **Proposal Title**  \n**“Presilience in the Classroom: Qur’anic Reflection and Post-Traumatic Growth for Education in Volatile Futures”**\n\n---\n\n### **Abstract (498 words)**  \nConflict, displacement, pandemics, and climate disruption point to a simple truth: the future of education will be volatile. Schools will increasingly be called to serve children carrying invisible burdens of loss and upheaval. Yet we cannot expect every classroom to become a clinic, or every teacher to become a therapist. What we need are pedagogical practices that are not therapy—but that help teachers create conditions where resilience and growth become possible.  \n\nThis presentation introduces **presilience**—the cultivation of inner and collective resources that prepare individuals and communities to meet difficulty before it arrives. Presilience draws on two sources: post-traumatic growth (PTG) research and Islamic attentional practices rooted in Qur’anic reflection and gratitude. Together, these inform teacher-friendly methods that make classrooms more humane, spiritually nourishing, and resilient in times of crisis.  \n\nThe presentation builds on two streams of work:  \n\n1. **Research with Social Entrepreneurs in Lebanon.** My master’s thesis (Université de Paris) studied post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs after the Beirut Port Blast, exploring how narrative, meaning-making, and social support correlated with flourishing despite profound disruption. The findings highlight the role of reflective storywork and peer-based practices in sustaining growth.  \n\n2. **Partnership with School Without Borders in Gaza.** Since 2023, I have been supporting educators running pop-up schools for displaced children. Together we co-designed simple protocols that weave Qur’anic reflection (tafakkur, shukr) with PTG-informed classroom practices. Teacher “presilience cards” translate insights into everyday routines: beginning class with gratitude, closing with reflective storytelling, integrating belonging and cooperative learning alongside academics. Teachers report that these practices make students feel more connected and hopeful, even amid ongoing conflict.  \n\nWhat emerges is not therapy but pedagogy: classrooms as spaces where faith, reflection, and community practices strengthen the human capacity to face hardship with dignity. Qur’anic attentional practices open what Muslim psychology calls the eye of the heart (qalb), while PTG frameworks provide evidence-based scaffolding for reflection and growth.  \n\nThe talk will share early field lessons, practical teacher tools, and reflections on integrating Islamic spirituality into educational contexts without medicalizing or pathologizing children’s experiences. It will also point toward broader implications: if volatility is the new normal, how do we design schools everywhere to prepare not only for exams, but for hardship?  \n\nBy bringing together research, lived experience, and field practice, this contribution offers a vision of spiritually integrated, teacher-led practices that can be adapted across Muslim-majority contexts and beyond. It is an invitation to educators, policymakers, and researchers to see classrooms not only as sites of learning, but as spaces of healing for the world our children will inherit.  \n\n---\n\n✅ This keeps you under the 500-word cap for both bio and abstract.  \n✅ It balances academic framing with lived experience (Beirut, Gaza, Bloom).  \n✅ It positions you as both researcher and practitioner.  \n\nDo you want me to also prepare a **1-sentence “aim”** (they often ask for that as a tagline) just in case?",

His work centers on accessible, spiritually-grounded pedagogies that support both educator and student wellbeing without medicalizing children's experiences.\n\nABSTRACT (250 words)\nEducators in conflict zones face an urgent challenge: how to support children's capacity to process hardship without pathologizing their experiences or adding unsustainable burdens to already-strained teaching practice.

That study identified specific character strengths—humor, judgment, and teamwork—that correlated with post-traumatic growth and continued social engagement. Critically, participants who articulated growth narratives during interviews were significantly more likely to persist in their work despite ongoing instability.\nBuilding on these findings, I partnered with School Without Borders educators in Gaza to translate research into practice. We co-designed \"presilience cards\"—simple protocols that weave Islamic attentional practices (tafakkur, shukr) with PTG-informed pedagogy.

Educators in the Global South and more so around the world, particularly as the expansion of wars and polarization becomes increasingly evident, are disproportionately affected.\n\nThis presentation introduces the concept of presilience, a method for building inner and collective resources before a crisis strikes, thereby setting our communities up for resilience and growth. The idea originates from my work in Lebanon and Palestine with educators and entrepreneurs over the past five years. \n\nFirst, my master's thesis in Lebanon. After the 2020 Beirut Port Blast, as the head of Research and Education at the Social Enterprise Accelerator Bloom, I studied social entrepreneurs who persevered despite economic collapse, the pandemic, and the explosion. The data revealed that individuals who could recount a story about what they learned from a prior difficulty were significantly more likely to persist in their efforts. The fact is that everyone in Lebanon experienced difficulty, so the story served as evidence that was confirmed in the literature on Post-Traumatic Growth. Narrativizing our challenges in groups helps us grow through difficulty. Additionally, four character strengths, growth, humor, judgment, and teamwork, correlated with resilience. \n\nSecond, field work in Gaza. Since 2023, I've partnered with School Without Borders, supporting teachers running pop-up schools for displaced children. We took the Lebanon findings and asked: What would this look like in a pop-up classroom in Gaza, in an active conflict where children are experiencing violence? The result was a workshop that bridged between Islamic Psychology and Post-Traumatic Growth. It was a humble offering to share our experience and identify simple shareable protocols to operationalize the research on resilience and PTG, helping weave Islamic practices of reflection (tafakkur) and gratitude (shukr) with what the research showed matters for resilience and growth.\n\nDrawing on shared Quranic framings, we offer practical ideas: teachers begin class with brief gratitude practices and conclude with reflective storytelling. They structure learning cooperatively rather than competitively. None of this requires extracurricular time. Teachers and students both find that these practices support their own well-being in contexts where mental health resources are limited. It’s also designed to be applied prior to acute traumatic incidents and to provide an overall improved learning environment.\n\nClassrooms (boardrooms, bedrooms, and kitchens) can become spaces where faith, reflection, and community naturally support people's capacity to face difficulty with dignity. Qur'anic and hadith literature (often memorized) provides scaffolding for communities to recall and deepen their connection to these practices, and our work demonstrates maps between resilience and post-traumatic growth frameworks, which provide evidence-based structure for reflection.\n\nWhile the work is in its early stages, the talk shares concrete tools, field lessons from Lebanon and Gaza, and a framework that teachers can adapt to their own contexts, and opens up space for identifying further relationships between Islamic Psychology and resilience and growth literature.",
