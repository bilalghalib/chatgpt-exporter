      "content": "There *are* traditions with a strong sense of oneness / non-duality that can **feel** nihilistic from the outside—even though their own teachers usually insist “this is *not* nihilism.” Here are three big ones and a few core lines from each.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Mahāyāna / Zen Buddhism  \n**Oneness principle:** All things are *empty* (śūnyatā) of any separate, fixed essence; everything exists only in mutual dependence. Ultimately there is no hard boundary between “me,” “you,” and “world.” citeturn1search1turn1search5  \n\n**Why it can feel nihilistic:**  \nIf nothing has inherent existence, it can sound like “nothing really exists” or “nothing matters,” especially when teachings stress “no self,” “no view,” etc.\n\n**Representative lines**\n\n- *“Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.”* — Heart Sūtra citeturn1search13  \n- Mahāyāna summary of emptiness: *“All things are empty of intrinsic existence and nature (svabhava).”* citeturn1search1turn1search12  \n- Thích Nhất Hạnh on non-attainment: *“Nothing is born, nothing dies. Nothing to hold on to, nothing to release. Saṃsāra is nirvāṇa. There is nothing to attain.”* citeturn0search26  \n\n(Within the tradition this is *anti-nihilistic*: because everything is interdependent, compassion and ethics become more urgent, not less.)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Advaita Vedānta (non-dual Hinduism)  \n**Oneness principle:** Only **Brahman**—pure consciousness—is ultimately real; the apparent world of multiplicity (prapañca) is a manifestation or illusion (māyā). The term *advaita* literally means “not-two.” citeturn2search0turn0search21  \n\n**Why it can feel nihilistic:**  \nIf the world is “illusion” and only the impersonal Absolute is real, everyday life can sound meaningless or discarded as a mere dream.\n\n**Representative lines**\n\n- Ramana Maharshi (classic Advaita expression):  \n  *“The world is illusory, only Brahman is real, Brahman is the world.”* citeturn2search5turn0search32  \n- Advaita summary: *“Only Brahman, ‘the one’, is ultimately real while the world … is not fully real.”* citeturn2search0  \n- Nisargadatta-style radical nonduality: *“There is no ‘I am’, there is no I, there is nothing.”* citeturn2search3turn2search6  \n\n(Advaitins argue this isn’t nihilism because Brahman is fullness/Being-Consciousness-Bliss, and realizing it grounds deep compassion and ethical living.)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Daoism (Taoism)  \n**Oneness principle:** The **Dao** is the nameless, formless source and pattern of everything; all beings arise and return to it. citeturn3search20  \n\n**Why it can feel nihilistic:**  \nDaoist texts emphasize *non-being*, emptiness, and *wu-wei* (“non-action”), which, from a productivity / control mindset, can look like withdrawal or indifference.\n\n**Representative lines**\n\n- *“There is a thing inherent and natural, which existed before heaven and earth…  \n  It pervades everywhere and never becomes exhausted… I call it Tao.”* — **Tao Te Ching**, ch. 25 citeturn3search6turn3search20  \n- *“Become totally empty. Quiet the restlessness of the mind. Only then will you witness everything unfolding from emptiness.”* — Laozi, often linked to ch. 16 citeturn3search19turn3search17  \n\n(Again, within Daoism this “emptiness” is the fertile source of all life, not a void of meaning.)\n\n---\n\n### Quick meta-note on “oneness + nihilism”\n\nFrom *inside* these traditions:\n\n- **Oneness** = discovering a more real, more meaningful ground (Buddha-nature, Brahman, Dao).  \n- **What looks like nihilism** = a deliberate demolition of *certain* meanings (ego, rigid identities, fixed moralistic views) so a deeper, non-possessive meaning can emerge.\n\nIf you want, we can narrow in on one of these (e.g. “the most nihilistic-sounding Zen lines” vs “the most world-affirming lines”) and map how they dance with each other.",

      "content": "Think of it this way:  \n\nIf **nothing has a separate, fixed self**, then:\n\n- There is no *solid “me”* who can be ultimately protected at the expense of “you.”  \n- There is no *solid “you”* who is truly separate from “me.”  \n\nWhat’s left is **one flowing field of experience**. In that field, hurting you is literally disturbing the same field I’m made of. So *if I see clearly*, harming you is like harming my own hand.\n\nZen keeps saying: once you see this, **love and care stop being optional “nice extras”** and become the most natural way to live.\n\nLet me anchor that with some *world-affirming* Zen / Mahāyāna lines:\n\n---\n\n### 1. “Emptiness is not nothingness”\n\nA classic Zen teaching is:  \n\n> *Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.* — Heart Sūtra  \n\nPeople often hear: “emptiness = nothing matters.”  \nBut the second half is the key: **emptiness *is* form.**\n\n- “Emptiness” means: nothing exists as a sealed, independent unit.  \n- “Form” means: this *very* concrete world — your body, my coffee cup, children, traffic, bees.\n\nSo: this specific, vivid world **is exactly** the emptiness they’re talking about. It’s not saying “the world is fake.” It’s saying “the world is radically relational.”\n\n---\n\n### 2. Dōgen: this very world is enlightenment\n\nZen master Dōgen flips the “otherworldly” thing on its head:\n\n> *“Those who see worldly life as an obstacle to Dharma see no Dharma in everyday actions; they have not yet discovered that there are no everyday actions outside of Dharma.”*  \n\nHe’s saying:  \n- If you think “real spirituality” is somewhere else, you’ve missed it.  \n- **Washing dishes, emailing, changing diapers** – all of that is the field where awakening shows up.  \n\nThat’s profoundly *world-affirming*: the point is not to escape life, but to show up fully *in* it.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Non-separation → compassion\n\nZen often uses this logic (sometimes very bluntly):\n\n1. **No separate self:** the “I” you’re defending is a process, not a little marble inside you.  \n2. **Inter-being:** your existence depends on air, plants, parents, language, society. You are “made of” others.  \n3. So when you really see this, **your body-mind relaxes its hard boundaries**.  \n4. From there, compassion isn’t a rule; it’s like a *reflex*.\n\nThích Nhất Hạnh puts it beautifully with “inter-being” (he’s Zen, even if he sounds very soft):  \n\n> When you look at a piece of paper, you can see the cloud, the rain, the logger, the sunshine. Without them the paper cannot be.  \n> … If you are alive, anything you do for your own transformation also benefits the world.\n\nSo: if everything co-arises, **my healing is part of your healing**, and your suffering vibrates in me. That *increases* ethical urgency rather than killing it.\n\n---\n\n### 4. “Emptiness without compassion is not real emptiness”\n\nMany Zen teachers actually *warn* about nihilism:\n\n- If you hear “all is empty” and conclude “nothing matters,” they’ll say:  \n  “That’s **dead Zen** — you’re attached to emptiness.”\n\nLiving Zen is usually framed as **emptiness + compassion**:\n\n- Emptiness cuts through clinging, fear, rigid identity.  \n- Compassion is how that freedom *moves* in the world.\n\nIf someone uses emptiness as an excuse for cruelty or apathy, traditional Zen says they simply **don’t understand emptiness yet**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Why “more urgent,” not less?\n\nIn a worldview with **separate, eternal selves**, I can tell myself:\n\n- “Ultimately it’s just *me* and my salvation/enlightenment/success; others are secondary.”\n\nIn a worldview of **radical interdependence**:\n\n- I *can’t* cleanly succeed while you drown; we are literally entangled.  \n- My peace depends on the wider field being more peaceful.  \n- So **caring for you is also the most intelligent way to care for me**.\n\nThat’s the core intuition behind the line you quoted:\n> because everything is interdependent, compassion and ethics become more urgent, not less.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, next step could be:  \n- I can pull a handful of *very* “this-world” Zen stories (like sweeping the floor, feeding a stray cat, etc.) and annotate line-by-line how they encode non-nihilistic oneness.",

      "content": "Short answer: **fully non-dual *and*** sincerely nihilistic is rare in religion**, because once you go all-in on “nothing matters,” it’s hard to motivate any practice or community. But there *are* real currents where:\n\n- reality is **one / non-dual**,  \n- distinctions are **flattened or relativized**, and  \n- it’s easy (and sometimes fair) to read them as **nihilistic or near-nihilistic.**\n\nHere are a few, with the clearest examples.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Zhuangzi-style Daoism – “equalizing things”\n\n**Oneness / non-dual vibe**\n\nZhuangzi has some of the strongest “everything is one” lines in any classic text, e.g.:\n\n> “Heaven and earth were born at the same time I was,  \n> and the ten thousand things are one with me.”\n\nAnd he constantly mocks rigid distinctions: right/wrong, useful/useless, life/death.  \n\n**Why it can feel flat / nihilistic**\n\n- He “equalizes” distinctions: from a high enough view, *all* claims, roles, and values are just local perspectives.  \n- He often responds to suffering, loss, or death with a kind of cosmic shrug or dark humor (banging on pots when his wife dies, etc.).  \n- Morality as a fixed code dissolves into “wandering” in spontaneous accord with the Dao.\n\nFor some readers, this lands as:  \n> “Ultimately, *none* of our meanings are more valid than others; it’s all just perspectives floating in the same vastness.”\n\nZhuangzi himself is more playful than despairing, but if you push the “equalization of all things” hard, you get very close to a kind of **value-flattened non-dualism**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Radical / “Neo-Advaita” nonduality – “nothing matters, no one here”\n\nThis isn’t a classical religion so much as a **modern offshoot of Advaita Vedānta** and similar non-dual teachings.\n\n**Oneness principle**\n\n- Only “what is” / pure awareness / the Absolute is real.  \n- The person, doer, seeker, path, ethics, progress—all are illusion.\n\nTypical radical-nonduality lines (paraphrased from many teachers):\n\n> “There is no you, no me, no world, no God, no purpose.  \n> Things just appear in what you are. That’s all.”\n\n**Why it’s genuinely close to nihilism**\n\nCompared to classical Advaita (which usually insists on dharma, compassion, etc.), this style often:\n\n- **rejects practice**: meditation, ethics, devotion are sometimes mocked as “illusion trying to fix itself.”\n- **rejects teleology**: no goal, no progress, no better or worse.\n- **doesn’t rebuild an ethical frame**: if “there is no one,” then harm and care are equally “just appearances.”\n\nYou still have a kind of mystical monism (“only this non-dual suchness”), but there’s **very little structure about what’s worth doing**. It can function as **spiritualized flat nihilism**, depending on how it’s lived.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Secular scientific monism – one reality, no inherent value\n\nNot a religion, but for many people it *plays the same role.*\n\n**Oneness principle**\n\n- There is **one kind of stuff** (matter/energy/fields), one set of laws, one universe.  \n- Consciousness, meaning, morality = emergent patterns in that one physical substrate.\n\n**Why it’s often explicitly nihilistic**\n\nIf you add:\n\n- “Values are evolutionary accidents,”  \n- “Consciousness is an illusion,”  \n- “In the long run everything dies and nothing is remembered,”  \n\nyou get a **non-dual, one-layer ontology** (only physics is real) with an explicit **denial of objective or ultimate value.** That’s a kind of **hard monist nihilism**: all distinctions—including moral and spiritual ones—are, at bottom, just different arrangements of atoms.\n\nSome people rebuild meaning on top (humanism, care, beauty), but others lean all the way into “none of it really matters.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. “Dead Zen” / “emptiness sickness” (criticized from within)\n\nYou already saw the *healthy* Zen version (“emptiness → compassion”). Zen literature itself warns about a **sick variant**:\n\n- You glimpse “no-self” or “emptiness” intellectually.  \n- You conclude: “Nothing is real, nothing matters, I can do whatever.”  \n- Practice, ethics, and compassion are dismissed as “just more illusion.”\n\nZen masters explicitly call this **“dead Zen”** or “falling into emptiness” and roast students who go there—but the fact they need that warning means this **nihilistic reading really happens**.\n\nSo while *official* Zen is anti-nihilist, there is a **recurring, recognizable failure mode** that *is* basically flat, non-dualish nihilism:\n\n> “All is empty, so why bother?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why full-on nihilistic non-dual religion is rare\n\nIf you combine:\n\n1. **Strong non-dual oneness** (all is one / empty / equal), **and**  \n2. **No rebuilt sense of value, care, or practice,**\n\nyou quickly get a community that:\n\n- has no reason to preserve a canon, ritual, or lineage,  \n- has no basis to correct abuse or harm (“no self, no victim”),  \n- and doesn’t sustain itself over generations.\n\nSo in living religions, non-duality almost always comes with some kind of **value re-rise**:\n\n- Daoism → harmony with the Dao.  \n- Classical Advaita → dharma, compassion, sattva.  \n- Mahāyāna / Zen → bodhisattva vow, universal compassion.  \n\nWhere it doesn’t, it tends to pop up as **fringe movements or personal philosophies** (neo-Advaita; some Zhuangzi-style readers; hard physicalist nihilism) rather than robust, long-lived “religions.”\n\n---\n\nIf you want, next step we could:\n\n- take *one* of these (e.g. Zhuangzi, radical nonduality, or physicalist monism),  \n- pull a few key lines,  \n- and dissect: “Here’s exactly where the oneness is doing value-flattening rather than value-deepening.”",

      "content": "Nice rabbit hole 😊 Short version: “Dead Zen” *isn’t* a separate school with its own teachers; it’s a **warning label used inside Zen** for certain failure modes—especially quietist or nihilistic misreadings of emptiness. But there *are* good online references, and some clear names attached to the critique.\n\n### 1. Hakuin Ekaku – the main “Dead Zen” critic\n\nHakuin (18th-c. Rinzai master) is your central node here.\n\n- His **“Zen sickness”** and recovery are described in his autobiographical text *Yasenkanna* (“Idle Talk on a Night Boat”) and summarized in English in pieces like *Zen Sickness, by Zen Master Hakuin* on *Buddhism Now* (English translation + commentary). citeturn1search2turn1search10  \n- The **Wikipedia article on Hakuin** has a concise section on his opposition to “Do-nothing Zen”: he attacked teachers who, after a small kenshō, “passed day after day in a state of seated sleep,” equating tranquil blankness with enlightenment. citeturn2search5  \n\nScholarly refs that explicitly use **“dead Zen”** for this:\n\n- **E. Nishimura,** “Hakuin’s ‘Commentary and Poems on the Prajñāpāramitā-hṛdaya’” (PDF). It states: *“The admonition against ‘dead Zen’ is one of Hakuin’s important teachings.”* citeturn2search15  \n- **A. Larrabee,** “A Love Knowing Nothing: Zen Meets Kierkegaard,” *Journal of Buddhist Ethics*. She cites Hakuin describing an early practice of just zoning out in calm as **“dead Zen” or dead sitting**, and contrasts it with a more engaged, post-satori path. citeturn1search9  \n\n**Teachers / lineages to look at (for the *critique* of Dead Zen, not the “path”):**\n\n- **Hakuin Ekaku** himself and his line (modern Rinzai training heavily shaped by him).  \n- His successors and popularizers like **Tōrei Enji** and, in the 20th c., teachers influenced by Hakuin’s rigorous style (e.g. Harada–Yasutani stream), who all stress: *kenshō + lifelong integration* vs. “I had one glimpse, I’m done.” citeturn2search5turn1search11  \n\nSo: if you want to study “Dead Zen,” you mostly read **Hakuin and his commentators**, because they’re the ones naming and dissecting it.\n\n---\n\n### 2. “Emptiness sickness” / kūbyō – the explicitly nihilistic side\n\nThis is the more philosophical label for the same problem: **falling into emptiness in a way that becomes flat or nihilistic.**\n\nGood online references:\n\n- **Bret W. Davis,** “The Kyoto School” in the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* explains *emptiness-sickness* (Japanese **kūbyō**): if you negate beings but don’t also “empty emptiness,” you end up with “a pessimistic nihilism or a reified emptiness”—what the Buddhist tradition calls *emptiness-sickness*. citeturn1search7turn2search2  \n- **A. C. Muller, “The Four Maladies”** (online essay) describes one malady as “emptiness sickness”: *holding inappropriately to an attitude of non-existence of self and world* that leads to a **dangerous nihilistic outlook**. citeturn2search3turn1search3  \n\nYou’ll see this picked up in discussion forums too (newbuddhist, dharmawheel, etc.) where people explicitly talk about sliding into **nihilism or depression via a one-sided grasp of emptiness**. citeturn1search3turn1search18  \n\nAgain, this isn’t a lineage but a **diagnosis**. The “teachers of this path” are really:\n\n- Classical Mahāyāna and Chan/Zen authors who **warn** about it (Nāgārjuna indirectly; later East Asian commentators).  \n- Modern philosophers of the Kyoto School (Nishitani, etc.) who analyse how a mis-read emptiness collapses into nihilism and how to go *through* that, not stop there. citeturn1search7turn2search2  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Modern “living Zen vs dead Zen” language\n\nContemporary teachers sometimes explicitly contrast **“living Zen”** with **“dead Zen”**:\n\n- A Cheltenham Zen article (UK sangha) directly invokes Hakuin, describing “do-nothing Zen” as monks convinced of inherent enlightenment who “simply sit around doing nothing,” like “a cold pot of water on an unlit stove”—no transformation. citeturn2search16turn2search19  \n- Some “Living Zen” communities and posts say “Living Zen is practice in interaction… not dead Zen,” using “dead Zen” as shorthand for **textbook Zen + no embodied engagement.** citeturn1search1turn1search12  \n\nI wouldn’t label any living teacher as *a* “Dead Zen teacher”—that term is almost always **pejorative**. It’s used *about* teachers/practitioners who:\n\n- cling to a blank, dissociated calm,  \n- treat “nothing matters” as insight, or  \n- stop practicing/serving after a minor awakening.\n\nThe folks worth reading are the ones who **attack** that posture: Hakuin, his descendants in Rinzai training, Kyoto School thinkers unpacking emptiness-sickness, and modern Zen teachers who keep hammering “emptiness + compassion + activity” as the antidote.\n\nIf you want, next step I can do a mini-reader: like 6–8 specific passages (Hakuin, Kyoto School, a modern Rinzai piece) with a one-line gloss on how each diagnoses “dead/nihilistic” Zen.",
