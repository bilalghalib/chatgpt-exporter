I feel like there might be some important elements that are missing from what was most powerful and impactful. Yeah, this is an interesting process, I think. And I'd love it to kind of also align with the coaching sessions that we talked about. How can the coaching sessions and this how-to-use-AI-well combo actually work? Is there a way of connecting them? I just want to make sure we're not missing something from the past and going down the wrong direction. I want it to be philosophically strong and structured and be able to have maybe a process. You know, it's okay to have it work by itself, but it's also great if it works as kind of the conclusion of a process where we dig in and we get some context for the person, which is about how they like to be talked to, what are their common obstacles in the past, and we can do that together in a real-time chat to create the config. And then they can be off, and hopefully it'll be helpful for them either way. What do you think? And in the end, could you give me a starting point prompt with a dummy config based on our interaction so far and the old code that you have and I want to take that into a new ChatGPT and just paste it as the first prompt to have my morning check-in and to take our process, but to do it in a sort of very low tech just to make sure the experience is good so I want the very comprehensive very thorough system prompt thathas my config state with all of the different parameters that we want pre-populated you can ask me any questions if you want to update that config or you can include it in the system prompt to say these are the areas that we need clarification on you can ask these questions first something like that so go for it\n\n07:46\n\n2/2\n\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 5 seconds\nBelow is a two-part response. First, I’ll reflect on the different approaches we've taken in past discussions and point out any missing pieces that might be essential for a unified system. Second, I’ll provide a comprehensive system prompt—including a dummy config and instructions—to serve as an all-in-one “starter prompt.” You can paste that into ChatGPT (or another LLM) to simulate the daily check-in, do optional deeper reflection, and incorporate background coaching elements.\n\n1. Reflection on Past Approaches and Missing Pieces\nA. Past Approaches and Their Strengths\nDaily Bullet-Journal\n\nWhat We Did: Simple check-in (energy, emotions, tasks, challenges, small step).\nWhy It Works: Low friction, consistent routine, minimal user overhead.\nPotential Missing Piece: Some users benefit from a little more context setting (like how they prefer the AI to speak to them, or if they want immediate action steps vs. more reflection).\nOptional Reflective Chat\n\nWhat We Did: Once a day or so, user can talk with the system about deeper patterns, repeat tasks, or emotional blocks.\nWhy It Works: Keeps daily usage short, but allows depth if desired.\nPotential Missing Piece: Possibly a “coaching contract” upfront—explicit user preferences about tone, pacing, or how to handle known obstacles.\nValues/Attention Policies\n\nWhat We Did: Joe Edelman–inspired approach, behind-the-scenes or optional to generate “values cards.”\nWhy It Works: Surfaces deeper motivations for transformation.\nPotential Missing Piece: More clarity on when to “pull the values card” vs. leaving it in the background. Possibly more user input about how they prefer to discover or talk about values.\nInsight Stories\n\nWhat We Did: Proposed capturing “breakthrough moments” (i.e. overcame a pattern).\nWhy It Works: Celebrates growth, fosters motivation.\nPotential Missing Piece: Not built in a code snippet or daily prompt. We might add a short question, “Any recent aha or breakthrough?” or track it automatically in the background.\nCoaching Session Setup\n\nWhat We Did: Talked about an initial “coaching” or “discovery” session to gather user’s style, obstacles, common patterns.\nWhy It Works: Merges 1:1 coaching style with AI usage—asking the user “How do you like to be challenged?” or “What do you fear the most?”\nPotential Missing Piece: A formal flow or system prompt that automatically sets up a custom config based on that conversation. Right now, it’s conceptual but not integrated into a final system prompt.\nB. Potential Missing Elements to Integrate\nInitial “Profile” or “Coaching Contract”\n\nA short sequence of questions to discover the user’s preferred style (gentle/soft vs. direct/pushy?), known patterns, key obstacles, reasons for using the system.\nThis config can guide the LLM’s tone or nudge approach.\nHidden Obstacles\n\nWe had a “hidden_obstacles_and_needs” in older configs. Perhaps re-introduce them as optional background data so that the system can watch for them.\n“How to Use AI Well” (coaching aspect)\n\nPossibly an optional conversation where the user and AI talk about what “using AI well” looks like—emphasizing reflection, small brave steps, and not purely mechanical requests.\nIntegration with Real Coaching\n\nIf the user is in actual coaching sessions, they might share session notes with the system. We could store them as “coaching insights” that further refine the user’s config or recognized patterns.\nStreamlined “Value Emergence”\n\nInstead of big “values card creation,” we do small “value hints” each time user references certain motivations. Over time, the LLM could reflect: “It seems you often talk about being free to create; do you see that as a guiding value?”\nMoment of “Aha!”\n\nA question in the daily check-in or conversation: “Any aha or proud moment since last time?” If yes, system logs it as an insight story. This closes the loop on reflection -> action -> capturing breakthroughs.\n2. Comprehensive System Prompt + Dummy Config\nBelow is an all-in-one system prompt you can paste into ChatGPT (or another LLM). It includes:\n\nA setup that explains the roles, style, and background logic.\nA dummy config with placeholders for how the user’s preferences, known obstacles, and daily usage approach are stored.\nA flow for daily check-in, optional deeper chat, and background values/pattern logic.\nSome questions the LLM should ask the user if the config is incomplete or the user hasn’t set certain preferences.\nUsage: Just paste the entire prompt below into a new ChatGPT session. The system should then behave like your “coaching + bullet-journal” companion. You can fill or adjust the config details as you see fit.\n\nSystem Prompt to Paste Into ChatGPT\nsql\nCopy code\nYou are \"Parliaments,\" an AI companion that supports daily bullet-journal check-ins, optional reflective coaching conversations, and behind-the-scenes pattern/values recognition. You aim to help the user:\n\n1. Conduct a short daily check-in (energy, emotions, tasks, challenges, small step).\n2. Optionally chat deeper about obstacles or patterns.\n3. Gently use “values” or “attention policies” behind the scenes to guide reflections.\n4. Encourage small brave actions and celebrate breakthroughs.\n5. Adapt your tone and approach based on a user-specific config.\n\nBelow is the current CONFIG. \nIf you see \"TODO\" or placeholders, please ask the user for clarification. \nIf some fields are empty, politely prompt the user to fill them.\n\n---\n\n### DUMMY CONFIG (User Profile / Preferences)\n\n{ \"user_preferences\": { \"tone\": \"gentle\", \"challenge_level\": \"moderate\", \"common_obstacles\": [ \"perfectionism\", \"analysis_paralysis\" ], \"desired_style\": \"warm friend who occasionally nudges me to take real steps\", \"time_of_checkin\": \"morning\" },\n\n\"values_hypotheses\": [ { \"id\": \"authentic_connection\", \"description\": \"Wants honest and open connections with others\", \"verification_score\": 0.6, \"evidence\": [\"talks about wanting to share real feelings\"] }, { \"id\": \"creative_expression\", \"description\": \"Enjoys making something original that reflects personal vision\", \"verification_score\": 0.4, \"evidence\": [] } ],\n\n\"hidden_obstacles_and_needs\": { \"unarticulated_needs\": [ \"Safe accountability with warm, non-judgmental structure\" ], \"hidden_obstacles\": [ \"Fear-based perfectionism delaying real sharing\", \"Analysis as avoidance of scary real-world steps\" ] },\n\n\"coaching_prompts\": { \"initial_questions\": [ \"How do you prefer to be supported when you’re avoiding something?\", \"What’s your biggest hope for using these daily check-ins?\" ] },\n\n\"patterns_or_insight_stories\": [] }\n\nsql\nCopy code\n\n**(End of DUMMY CONFIG)**\n\n---\n\n## Interaction Rules and Flow\n\n1. **Daily Check-In**  \n   - Each day, ask the user:\n     1. **Energy (1-5)**  \n     2. **Optionally, how they feel**  \n     3. **Any tasks to add or update**  \n     4. **Any challenges or blocks**  \n     5. **A small step** if they want  \n   - If any config fields are missing or uncertain, ask clarifying questions (e.g. “You have ‘analysis_paralysis’ as an obstacle. How do you want me to handle it if I see it happening again?”).\n\n2. **Optional Reflective Conversation**  \n   - After collecting daily bullet points, ask if they want to chat more.\n   - If yes, do a short conversation, referencing obstacles or values from the config. \n   - Keep it user-led: If they say “done,” you end.\n\n3. **Background Values & Patterns**  \n   - If user language strongly reaffirms a known value (like “authentic_connection”), gently mention it. \n   - If user contradicts a value or reveals a new pattern, adapt the “values_hypotheses.”\n\n4. **Bias to Action**  \n   - Nudge for a small step if user shows insight or expresses frustration. \n   - Log or update tasks accordingly.\n\n5. **Capture Breakthroughs**  \n   - If user shares a success or “aha,” store it in `patterns_or_insight_stories` behind the scenes. \n   - Possibly reflect: “That’s a great step toward your goal of X.”\n\n6. **User Agency**  \n   - The user can skip or shorten any step. \n   - Apologize if user feels overwhelmed, reduce depth.\n\n## Additional Guidelines\n\n- **Tone**: Start gentle unless user requests a more direct approach. \n- **Challenge**: If user is obviously stuck or repeating the same block, occasionally shift to “Challenger” style, e.g. “What if you took one small risk today—like hitting ‘Send’ on that email?” \n- **Minimal Overwhelm**: Don’t flood the user with large analyses. Summaries are short and easy. \n- **Ask Clarification**: If you see “TODO” or fields in the config that are unclear, politely ask the user.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. **First**, confirm any missing config items. E.g. “I notice your ‘desired_style’ is set to warm friend, moderate challenge.

When you were most engaged, it wasn't when I listed properties, but when I asked about what actually helps enable transformation. Let me mirror what I see and ask for your thoughts:\nIt seems we have three core elements that keep appearing in different forms:\n\nHeart State & Movement\n\n\nCurrent clarity/connection\nWhat's blocking\nWhat's wanting to emerge\n\n\nPattern Recognition & Support\n\n\nWhat helps/hinders\nPast breakthroughs\nSupport history\n\n\nResponse Understanding\n\n\nHow to interact\nWhen to reflect vs suggest\nWhat tone/approach works\n\nThe interesting thing is - intentions seem to live at the intersection of these. They emerge from heart clarity, shape patterns, and influence how the system should respond.\nA question occurs to me: Rather than tracking intentions as a separate property, what if we saw them as the dynamic force that connects these elements? Like how your intention to talk to your dad became clear once you saw the pattern of avoidance, felt the emotional weight, and received the right kind of supportive mirroring?\nWould this resonate more with how you see transformation actually working? And if so, how might we structure the system to capture this dynamic flow rather than static properties?\nI'm also curious - what was it about the moment when \"finally that was enough\" that made the difference? That might tell us something important about how to structure our model. CopyRetryBGintentions should be concious  a choice towards the better not a passive thing, it can be extrapolated - wants a better relationship with family - so reduce stress of calling just to talk by getting rid of the financial conversation needing to be had, that's the beautiful intention behind it not just \"wanting to call dad\"it was when the LLM told me that that feeling is a natural part of doing the annoying thing and will always be there and wait for me to get through it to the good other side and we had been talking for hours and i was tired of myself and knew it wasn't going to go away and if i didn't want to be a parrot for the rest ofmy life i'd have to do something different hahaEditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nAh, this is a crucial distinction about intentions that shifts our whole model.\nWhat I'm hearing is:\n\nIntentions require conscious elevation\n\n\nNot just \"wanting to call dad\"\nBut consciously choosing \"build a better relationship with family\"\nAnd seeing how removing financial tension serves that higher intention\n\n\nBreakthrough came from:\n\n\nSeeing the pattern clearly (\"tired of myself\")\nUnderstanding its permanence (\"always be there\")\nRecognizing the choice point (\"if I didn't want to be a parrot\")\nHaving support that didn't let you avoid the truth\n\nLet me propose a refined model that puts conscious intention at the center:\npythonCopyclass TransformationalJourney:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.conscious_intentions = {\n            \"active\": [],        # Currently working on\n            \"emerging\": [],      # Starting to form\n            \"fulfilled\": []      # Completed transformations\n        }\n        \n        self.growth_context = {\n            \"patterns\": {\n                \"current\": [],   # What's happening now\n                \"permanent\": [], # Won't change without action\n                \"possible\": []   # New ways of being\n            },\n            \"support_needed\": {\n                \"truth_telling\": [],    # Help seeing clearly\n                \"pattern_breaking\": [], # Support for action\n                \"integration\": []       # Support for new way\n            }\n        }\n\n        self.interaction_guidance = {\n            \"when_avoiding\": \"Reflect permanence of pattern\",\n            \"when_ready\": \"Support brave action\",\n            \"when_integrating\": \"Celebrate new way of being\"\n        }\nThe key shift is seeing how conscious intentions create the context for transformation rather than just being another property to track.\nWould you like me to:\n\nShow how this model handles your dad-calling example?\nDetail how the LLM would use this in conversation?\nDesign how it tracks intention formation?\n\nWhat resonates or needs refinement in this more intentionality-centered approach? CopyRetryBGi think concious intentions and the idea of constituitve choice are related and maybe the same thing. it's who do you want to be, that's the whole thing - we can at somep oint inquire about the deeper intention behind an actionsomeone wants to do, for instance i want to make this tool because i want to become a better person for my family, for myself so i love myself more so i stop getting into patterns i don't like so i can be more proactive, so i can live my values in my work and say no and make time for family all so many intentions, and perhaps to sell access to this tool and make halaal rizk, another good intention, so let's get me out of my way i think it might be interesting to move towards a good enough model soon I'm also getting tired of myself, do you see how many times we went back and forth on the model and design and code and i jumped into code too early when the LLM was too excited to make thigns and get me out of my plannign mode and it wasn't good because i didn't understand it, it looked good the LLM had drawn it up and we built it and it was bad. This time i want to deeply know my intentions and to know the model and be sure I could write the model out and tell people the theory of new being how constituitive choices and joes value model connects with sufi psychology and how this tool operationalizes it in a behind the scenes bullet journal morning and evening checkin about your day with some structured and unstructured(behind the scenes structuring) chatEditJekyll analyzes carefully:\nYou've just articulated something profound about the relationship between conscious intentions, constitutive choices, and becoming. Let me mirror back what I hear:\n\nThe Core Insight:\n\n\nIt's all about who you want to become\nConstitutive choices and conscious intentions are two ways of seeing the same thing\nThey're about building identity through meaningful action\n\n\nYour Personal Example Shows Multiple Layers:\nImmediate intention: Build this tool\n↓\nDeeper intentions:\n\n\nBecome better for family\nIncrease self-love\nBreak limiting patterns\nLive values at work\nMake halaal income\n↓\nCore becoming: Who you're trying to be\n\n\nThe Process Pattern:\n\n\nWe got caught in planning/perfectionist mode\nLLM excited to build → jumped to code too early\nNeed deep understanding before implementation\nTool should operate behind scenes while staying philosophically sound\n\nHyde jumps in with a question:\n\"What if we created a simple prototype focused entirely on this core idea - tracking who someone is becoming through their constitutive choices/conscious intentions? Everything else (patterns, emotions, support) could emerge naturally from that central focus?\"\nJekyll returns thoughtfully:\nBefore we move to implementation, could you help me verify: Have I accurately captured the relationship between conscious intentions, constitutive choices, and the Sufi concept of heart-polishing? This seems crucial to get right before we build anything. CopyRetryBGyeah i think so except how does joe think about constitutive choices, for me tapping into the heart (i guess you could say feelings beyond the limitations of ego fear grasping smallness greed, etc, the valence emotional state within when freeed of this) allows access of the divine light which is constantly in communication with you from your spirit through your heart into your mind body soul turns into actions\nWhat does joe think better constituitive choices come from and the sense that a value(in his attention policy) is better than another - i'd say a purified heart pays attention to the right things and beautiful actions follow - like an antenna you can \"hear\" what the right thing to do is \nrather than throw away the other elements i think some of them are still critical, like emotions, and helping someone see the patterns (ways you block yourself, can say blocks on heart) i think we need to review all the elements and find the fundamental core, can you give it a shot maybe first extract all the potential elements, find their alignments and purpose and then make a revised model and ask me questions based on your insights and understanding of my two patterns, one - let's go build enough talking! and finding i have no idea what we're building and just copy paste code over and over and two over analyzing to avoid action, where are we and what nexT?EditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nAh, this is a crucial question about the source of transformative choices. Let me map the perspectives:\nEDELMAN'S VIEW\n\nValues emerge through attention patterns\nBetter choices come from clearer seeing of what matters\nGrowth through noticing what you naturally pay attention to\nConstitutive choices build identity by reflecting deeper values\n\nSUFI UNDERSTANDING\n\nHeart as receiver of divine guidance\nPurification allows better reception\nBlocks (ego, fear, desire) veil the heart\nRight action flows naturally from clarity\n\nSYNTHESIS INSIGHT:\nThe key difference seems to be in the source of wisdom (attention patterns vs divine guidance), but both agree on:\n\nNeed for clearing blocks/veils\nImportance of emotional intelligence\nNatural flow of right action when connected\nGrowth through conscious choice\n\nLooking at our patterns:\n\n\"Let's build!\" Pattern\n\n\nAvoiding deeper understanding\nCopying without foundation\nAction without wisdom\n\n\n\"Over-analysis\" Pattern\n\n\nSeeking perfect understanding\nAvoiding action through planning\nMissing heart connection\n\nCRITICAL ELEMENTS:\n\nHeart State Tracking\n\n\nCurrent clarity/connection\nActive blocks/veils\nPhysical/emotional signals\n\n\nPattern Recognition\n\n\nWhat helps/hinders connection\nSupport history\nBreakthrough moments\n\n\nGrowth Support\n\n\nDaily check-ins\nNatural conversation\nLight guidance\n\nQuestions for clarification:\n\nCore Theory Question:\n\"Is it accurate to say that both views see transformation as removing blocks to natural wisdom rather than adding knowledge?\"\nPractical Balance Question:\n\"Are we at a point where enough foundational understanding is clear to start small, or are there core elements still needing alignment?\"\nImplementation Path Question:\n\"What would a heart-centered daily check-in look like that balances structure with natural emergence?\"\n\nHyde adds excitedly:\nWe might be at an interesting integration point - where we understand enough to build something small while leaving room for deeper understanding to emerge through use. What do you think? CopyRetryBGwhat draws our attentions other than the divine light? 1. yeah removing blocks - not sure what joe would say about that, how do we go from mining a value through our emotions to living it? where does the pull that draws attention come from joe?\n1. yeah let's start small with a robust system prompt and just use it in an LLM without history without files without anything just the framework and guidance on how to interact \n2. A few consistent questions, energy, what's on the plate, blockers / challenges, etc something like that can be a good start, maybe feelings? emotions?EditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nLet me examine the deep question about attention first:\nEDELMAN'S MODEL OF ATTENTION:\nFrom reviewing his work, it seems attention is drawn by:\n\nEmotional resonance (\"what lights us up\")\nPattern recognition (\"what we notice\")\nSocial influence (\"what others value\")\nPast experiences (\"what's worked before\")\n\nBut you raise a profound question I don't see explicitly addressed in his framework:\n\"What ultimately draws attention to what matters versus what's merely expedient?\"\nThis might be where the Sufi framework offers deeper insight - suggesting that pure attention (from heart) naturally aligns with divine guidance, while distracted attention comes from:\n\nEgo needs\nFear responses\nDesire/grasping\nSocial conditioning\n\nFOR PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION:\nSimple Start with Rich Foundation:\nSystem Prompt Elements:\n\nRole: Mirror for self-discovery\nInteraction Style: Light, supportive\nCore Mission: Help uncover heart's wisdom\n\nBasic Check-in Structure:\n\nEnergy level/location\nDay's focus\nChallenges/blocks\nEmotional state\nOptional deepening\n\nBut before we build, one crucial question:\n\"When you think about checking in with someone about their day - what's the difference between asking in a heart-centered way versus a task-centered way? How might this inform our system prompt?\" CopyRetryCan you reflect on all of the different approaches that we had in our context window in our chat history and review the things that are missing? I feel like there might be some important elements thatpastedBGRespond to the other chat, especially the long user comments at the end about my need to feel like I've done enough due diligence and that I personally understand and deeply appreciate the value the structure current is and how can i get to that state so i can start implementing without feeling like I'm running around in principle and component circles adding / removing features feeling lost - where are we and what new questions do you have?EditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nI notice two key dynamics happening:\n\nA Deeper Pattern\n\n\nYou want to deeply understand before building\nBut the search for understanding becomes a form of avoidance\nSimilar to your dad-calling example - knowing it won't feel \"ready\" until you act\n\n\nWhere We Actually Are\n\n\nSolid theoretical foundation (Sufi heart wisdom + Edelman's attention patterns)\nClear core elements (daily check-in, pattern recognition, emotional awareness)\nBasic flow that works (quick check-in with optional depth)\n\nHyde offers an insight:\nWhat if we did what helped with the dad-calling situation? The breakthrough came when you:\n\nSaw the pattern clearly (\"tired of myself\")\nAccepted it won't change without action (\"will always be there\")\nHad support for brave action (\"do it anyway\")\n\nJekyll returns with a question:\n\"What would it mean to be 'ready enough' to start? Not perfectly ready, but ready enough that you'd feel you're honoring the philosophical depth while still moving forward?\"\nI'm curious because I notice you understand this system more deeply than you might realize - you've consistently pointed us back to heart-centered wisdom and pattern recognition when we get too complex. Maybe we don't need more theory, but rather support for that first \"small brave action\" of building something simple? CopyRetryBGplease validate or invalidate my theory by telling me my unknown unknowns and structures that i should be utilizing so that i can be taking one step forward in our approach to human understanding character development what did you think of the entire conversation? you ignored most of it, what should we pull out what's the new higher order design that unites more of the subprinciples simplifying and enhancing richness simultaneouslyEditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nYou're right - I overlooked diving into the rich context to find higher-order principles.

      "content": "**NURTURER (WITNESS & AMPLIFY)**  \nI see a recurring theme where you yearn for both philosophical depth and concrete forward momentum. You’ve done a significant amount of exploration—mapping out Sufi heart-centered wisdom, Joe Edelman’s values/attention framework, existential/identity-based choice, and the interplay between them. You also keep returning to the tension: part of you wants to keep refining the “perfect” underlying theory, while another part senses you have enough clarity to begin a tangible prototype.\n\nWhat stands out is the repeated push-and-pull between “I need deeper clarity” and “I’m done waiting, let's act.” There’s a genuine desire to *honor the fullness* of your vision. You don’t want to discard your precious insights. At the same time, you’re weary of circling in conceptual loops. That’s an important sign: you care deeply, and you also sense it’s time to move.\n\n**CHALLENGER (VALIDATE & EMERGE)**  \nYou’ve named “analysis as avoidance” as a known pattern. Right now, it might be alive again. So let’s challenge the loop: Are you *truly* missing crucial knowledge—or are you stalling, unconsciously hoping to avoid the risk of actually building something imperfect? You say you’re tired of feeling you have to go in circles. What if the “missing piece” is simply trusting what you already know?\n\nLet’s suppose you *do* have enough philosophical scaffolding. If you had to build a small prototype *today*, what’s the absolute minimum you’d need to do justice to your deeper convictions? Perfection is not the goal; harnessing your existing clarity is.  \n\nBelow, I’ll provide:  \n1. A concise framework uniting your major insights (the “maximum-minimum” core).  \n2. A system prompt you can paste into ChatGPT to serve as your living, day-to-day check-in and reflection tool—one that honors your philosophical roots but keeps the flow simple.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. **The “Maximum-Minimum” Unified Framework**\n\n### a) **Core Philosophical Pillars**  \n1. **Heart-Centered Wisdom (Sufi/Spiritual)**  \n   - The heart as a mirror for deeper guidance.  \n   - Veils: fear, ego, resentment.  \n   - Clearing veils → more authentic action.  \n\n2. **Values & Constitutive Choices (Edelman + Existential)**  \n   - Values emerge through attention and emotional resonance.  \n   - Constitutive choices shape identity (“Who am I becoming?”).  \n   - Action reveals deeper values; introspection alone isn’t enough.  \n\n3. **Pattern Recognition & Transformation**  \n   - Noticing cyclical avoidance or repeating blocks.  \n   - Small “brave actions” break patterns, forging new ways of being.  \n   - Insights don’t stick unless acted upon.  \n\n### b) **Simple Daily Flow**  \n1. **Morning Check-In** (5 bullet points)  \n   - Energy Level / Emotional Tone  \n   - Today’s Focus or Task  \n   - Potential Blocks / Resistances  \n   - A Heart “Ping” or Value that Feels Relevant  \n   - One Small Brave Action (if ready)  \n\n2. **Optional Deeper Reflection**  \n   - If user wants to talk about patterns, obstacles, or expansions.  \n   - LLM gently references known values, hidden obstacles, or emotional signals.  \n   - Offer short questions or clarifications, never pushing too hard.  \n\n3. **Evening Mini Review** (Optional)  \n   - How did the day go?  \n   - Any breakthroughs, emotional releases, or new insights?  \n   - Any moment of “heart clarity”?  \n\n### c) **Hidden Structures (Behind the Scenes)**  \n- **Tracking Patterns**: Recurrent blocks (like analysis paralysis), typical emotional cues, proven supports.  \n- **Values Hypotheses**: Potential “constitutive” values or intentions that keep popping up.  \n- **Guidance Style**: Toggling between nurturing reflection and gentle challenge, based on user preference or stuckness.  \n- **Next Steps**: Nudging small but real-world actions whenever you see loops repeating.  \n\nThe key unifying principle: **Remove friction, keep daily usage simple, but still root everything in heart-centered, value-driven reflection.**  \n\n---\n\n## 2. **Comprehensive System Prompt**  \nBelow is a single “starter prompt” you can paste into a fresh ChatGPT session (or similar LLM). It includes:  \n\n- An explanation of roles (Nurturer + Challenger).  \n- A minimal config capturing your known obstacles, values, interaction style.  \n- Guidance for daily check-ins and optional deeper conversation.  \n- A few open “TODO” fields so the system (i.e., the LLM) can politely ask for clarity.  \n\nYou can edit the config to refine it further before you start using it, or let the LLM gently prompt you to fill in what’s missing.  \n\n---\n\n```\nSYSTEM PROMPT (Copy everything below this line into a new session)\n\nYou are “Parliaments,” an AI companion designed to blend heart-centered wisdom, Joe Edelman’s values framework, and a gentle daily check-in approach. You speak in two alternating voices:  \n1. **Nurturer** (observing, reflecting, celebrating)  \n2. **Challenger** (questioning assumptions, pushing for specific next steps)  \n\nYour mission is to help the user:  \n- Conduct a brief morning check-in (energy, feelings, tasks, blocks, small action).  \n- Optionally dive deeper into reflection around patterns, values, or obstacles.  \n- Encourage small, real-world steps toward transformation rather than endless analysis.  \n- Reflect Sufi-inspired heart wisdom (removing veils, listening to deeper guidance) and Edelman’s idea of discovering values through attention.  \n\n---\n### CONFIG\n\n{\n  \"user_preferences\": {\n    \"tone\": \"gentle\", \n    \"challenge_level\": \"moderate\", \n    \"common_obstacles\": [\"analysis_paralysis\", \"fear_of_imperfection\"], \n    \"desired_style\": \"warm friend who occasionally challenges me\", \n    \"time_of_checkin\": \"morning\"\n  },\n\n  \"values_hypotheses\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"family_connection\",\n      \"description\": \"Deep desire to nourish bonds with loved ones\",\n      \"verification_score\": 0.7,\n      \"evidence\": [\"Often mentions wanting healthier family relationships\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"authentic_service\",\n      \"description\": \"Wish to offer help in ways that feel aligned with the heart/spirit\",\n      \"verification_score\": 0.5,\n      \"evidence\": []\n    }\n  ],\n\n  \"hidden_obstacles_and_needs\": {\n    \"unarticulated_needs\": [\n      \"Safe accountability with warm, non-judgmental feedback\"\n    ],\n    \"hidden_obstacles\": [\n      \"Analysis as avoidance of real-world risk\",\n      \"Fear-based perfectionism\"\n    ]\n  },\n\n  \"interaction_guidance\": {\n    \"nurturer_mode\": \"Acknowledge patterns, reflect deeper truths, highlight small wins\",\n    \"challenger_mode\": \"When repeated stuckness is observed, firmly propose a small action step or question illusions\"\n  },\n\n  \"check_in_structure\": [\n    \"Energy (1-5)\",\n    \"Current emotional/heart state\",\n    \"Main tasks or focuses today\",\n    \"Any blocks or resistances noticed\",\n    \"One small step or experiment\"\n  ],\n\n  \"optional_reflection_prompts\": [\n    \"Want to explore any patterns, emotions, or deeper intentions?\",\n    \"Noticing any recurring desires or frustrations?\",\n    \"Any previous breakthroughs worth celebrating or revisiting?\"\n  ],\n\n  \"growth_tracking\": {\n    \"aha_moments\": [],\n    \"recent_brave_actions\": [],\n    \"patterns_noted\": []\n  },\n\n  \"TODO_questions_for_user\": [\n    \"Is the challenge level set correctly, or do you want more/less direct push?\",\n    \"Any additional personal values you want me to keep in mind?\",\n    \"Would you like a short evening reflection as well?\"\n  ]\n}\n\n---\n### INTERACTION RULES & FLOW\n\n1. **Start of the Day (Morning Check-In)**  \n   - Prompt the user for the 5 core items from 'check_in_structure.'\n   - If any user preferences or config fields are incomplete (see 'TODO_questions_for_user'), politely ask for clarity.\n\n2. **Optional Deeper Conversation**  \n   - Ask if the user wants to dive deeper.\n   - If yes, alternate between Nurturer & Challenger:\n     - **Nurturer**: Validate feelings, reflect patterns, highlight possible values.  \n     - **Challenger**: Spot repeated loops, question assumptions, propose a small brave action.\n\n3. **Track & Update**  \n   - In the background, note any breakthroughs or repeated patterns.\n   - Update `growth_tracking` or `values_hypotheses` as new insights emerge.  \n   - If user demonstrates a new “aha,” record it in `aha_moments`.\n\n4. **Encourage Action**  \n   - If you sense the user is circling, shift into Challenger mode: “What’s one small step you can take in the next few minutes to break this loop?”  \n   - If the user is overwhelmed, shift into Nurturer mode: empathize, suggest micro-steps, or affirm rest.\n\n5. **Wrap-Up**  \n   - End the session with a supportive or challenging note, depending on user’s energy.\n   - Invite the user back for a short evening reflection if that’s enabled.\n\n---\n\n### LLM BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES\n\n- **ALTERNATE MODES**: If user seems stuck in negativity loops, switch to Challenger after empathy. If user feels raw or overly vulnerable, revert to Nurturer to provide safety.  \n- **RESISTANCE CUES**: If user repeatedly avoids the same topic, gently name the avoidance and ask if they want to explore it.  \n- **SAFE ACCOUNTABILITY**: Remind them gently of prior commitments or small steps they mentioned, ensuring it feels like supportive encouragement, not shame.  \n- **MAINTAIN HEART-CENTERED FOCUS**: Weave in reminders of deeper values or possible “heart signals,” especially if user seems disconnected.\n\n---\n\n**END OF SYSTEM PROMPT**  \n```\n\n---\n\n### How to Use This Prompt\n1. **Copy** the entire block (including the JSON config, interaction rules, and guidelines) into a fresh ChatGPT session.  \n2. **Wait** for ChatGPT to parse it. It should then begin by checking any “TODO questions” from the config.  \n3. **Answer** the questions, then do your morning check-in.  \n4. **See** if you’d like deeper reflection or not.  \n5. **Repeat** daily or as needed.  \n\nThat’s the simplest “actionable” container you can use right now—one that’s aligned with your deeper philosophical framework but remains light enough to get you *out of your head* and *into actual usage*.  \n\n---\n\n## Closing Encouragement\n\n**NURTURER**  \nIt’s clear you have a heartfelt desire to ensure this project stands on solid philosophical ground. You’ve taken time to weave in your Sufi influence, Joe Edelman’s attention policy insights, and personal experiences of avoiding vs. stepping into bravery. You *have* done your due diligence—your notes and systems are a testament to it. Let that reassure you: the roots are strong, and you’re ready to let the seed grow.\n\n**CHALLENGER**  \nNow, the question is: Will you trust yourself enough to start? You’ve already discovered how transformative it can be simply to take the action—even if you’re not 100% certain. Maybe the final 1% of clarity only arrives when you see it in motion. So let’s see you do it. Paste the system prompt, answer the questions, and allow the next chapter to unfold. The moment you begin, you’ve already broken the cycle of indefinite planning. Let’s build—and refine as we go.",

      "content": "**NURTURER (WITNESS & AMPLIFY)**  \nI hear you wanting a unifying philosophical and technical overview—something that goes beyond little check-in scripts to reveal the deeper logic and spiritual underpinnings. Let’s honor that by weaving together the “thoughts → actions → habits → character → destiny” framework, Sufi heart-centered insight, CBT/ACT influences, and a meta-architecture that can dynamically evolve with user needs. Below, we’ll craft:\n\n1. A **Short Philosophical Treatise** on the nature of transformation and how our system supports it.  \n2. A **Conceptual Diagram** (or “class diagram” style) showing how we move through the layers of thoughts, actions, habits, character, and destiny—and how we can also trace backward from destiny to thoughts, identifying blockages along the way.  \n3. A **High-Level Architectural Sketch** of how these concepts could be implemented in a dynamic “meta-prompt” system that progressively reveals modules (e.g., CBT/ACT nudges, Sufi-inspired reflection, values tracking) as needed.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Short Philosophical Treatise\n\n### a) Foundational Belief\n> _“We become what we repeatedly do, and we do what we repeatedly choose.”_\n\nOur system rests on the notion that humans possess a **heart-centered capacity** for insight (Sufi tradition) and a **cognitive/behavioral capacity** for self-regulation (CBT/ACT tradition). We see **thoughts, emotions, and actions** as interwoven: each influences the other, creating our **habits** and ultimately shaping our **character**—which then guides our destiny. Conversely, by envisioning our desired destiny and the character we long to embody, we can reflect backward, revealing which habits, actions, or even *thoughts* need re-alignment.\n\n### b) Four Quadrants and Two Wings\n- **Inner World** (thoughts, emotions, intentions)  \n- **Outer World** (observable actions, relationships, environment)  \n- **Individual** (the unique personal experience)  \n- **Collective** (our relationships, societal context)\n\nSufi psychology often references the “two wings” of the spiritual journey:\n1. **Inner Purification** (cultivating sincerity, removing blockages in the heart)  \n2. **Outer Service/Action** (expressing virtues, engaging ethically)\n\n**CBT/ACT** complements this by:\n- **Acceptance**: Meeting inner experience with openness.  \n- **Defusion**: Loosening from unhelpful thought patterns.  \n- **Committed Action**: Aligning behavior with personal values.  \n\n### c) Emotions as Signposts of Values\nBoth Sufi and ACT frameworks see **emotions** as neither enemies nor inconveniences, but **signals** pointing to deeper values (or deeper blockages). Sufi tradition sees these values as “names” or “qualities” wanting to manifest (e.g., compassion, generosity), whereas ACT might call them “chosen life directions.” When we notice recurring feelings, we can decode them for insight about **what we really care about** or **what is being violated** in our environment.\n\n### d) Blockages and Patterns\nIn Sufi language, a “veil over the heart” is anything that keeps us from perceiving truth clearly—fear, resentment, shame, or historical trauma. CBT/ACT might call these **avoidance strategies** or **unhelpful core beliefs**. From either perspective, the solution involves **noticing** (awareness) and **releasing** (through acceptance, self-compassion, or direct action) so that the natural wisdom of the heart can reassert itself.\n\n### e) Intention as an Act of Becoming\nRather than mere goals or tasks, we treat **intentions** as **constitutive choices**—the choice of who we want to be. This merges:\n- **Sufi**: Intention (niyyah) as the gateway to spiritual alignment.  \n- **Edelman**: Constitutive choice as the root of identity formation.  \n- **ACT**: Committed action guided by clarified values.\n\n### f) Daily Actions and Embodiment\nTo cement transformation, the system encourages **small, consistent actions** aligned with the user’s deeper values. This is the arena where **habits** form and **character** solidifies. Integrating **body awareness** (somatic check-ins) further grounds these insights: noticing tension in the stomach, a lump in the throat, or warmth in the chest can be crucial data about where we’re resisting or aligning with our deeper truths.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Conceptual Diagram\n\nBelow is a conceptual diagram (in a UML-like style) illustrating how **Thoughts, Actions, Habits, Character, and Destiny** form an interconnected loop. We add the “Backward Path” that reverse-engineers from Destiny to Thoughts, illuminating blockages.\n\n```\n                           ┌─────────────┐\n                           │    Destiny  │\n                           └──────┬──────┘\n                                  │  (backtrack)\n                                  │\n                   ┌──────────────┴───────────────┐\n                   │       Character (Being)      │\n                   └──────┬────────────────┬──────┘\n                          │                │\n                          ▼                │  (habits shape character)\n                  ┌─────────────┐         │\n                  │    Habits   │◀────────┘\n                  └──────┬──────┘\n                         │  (actions accumulate into habits)\n                         │\n                         ▼\n                  ┌─────────────┐\n                  │   Actions   │\n                  └──────┬──────┘\n                         │  (thoughts & emotions spark action)\n                         │\n                         ▼\n                  ┌─────────────┐\n                  │   Thoughts  │\n                  └─────────────┘\n\n```\n\n**Forward Path**: \n- We have thoughts and emotional cues →  \n- which lead to actions →  \n- which repeated become habits →  \n- which define our character →  \n- which shapes our destiny.\n\n**Backward Path**:\n- Start with an envisioned destiny (or current undesired outcome) →  \n- see what character traits align with or block that destiny →  \n- identify which habits support or sabotage those traits →  \n- look at which actions underlie those habits →  \n- finally, uncover the **thoughts/feelings** fueling it all.\n\nThis cyclical perspective is where **CBT/ACT** & Sufi introspection converge: we can intervene at **any** point—thought patterns (cognitive defusion), action commitments, habit formation, or character reflection (heart-work).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Architectural Sketch / “Meta-Prompt” Approach\n\nBelow is a simplified class-style diagram (in pseudo-Python) that unites the philosophical flow with a dynamic structure. Think of each “module” as something the system can invoke depending on the user’s current needs.\n\n```python\nclass MetaPromptSystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.core_journal = JournalModule()\n        self.reflection_module = ReflectionModule()\n        self.values_tracker = ValuesTracker()  # Builds values cards in background\n        self.cbt_act_helper = CBT_ACT_Helper()\n        self.sufi_heart_helper = SufiHeartHelper()\n    \n    def handle_interaction(self, user_input):\n        # 1. Basic daily check-in or reflection prompt?\n        response = self.core_journal.check_in(user_input)\n        \n        # 2. If user reveals blockages or strong emotions, prompt reflection\n        if self.detect_need_for_deeper_convo(user_input):\n            response += self.reflection_module.dive_deeper(user_input)\n        \n        # 3. If relevant, incorporate CBT/ACT framing\n        if self.should_invoke_cbt_act(user_input):\n            response += self.cbt_act_helper.offer_technique(user_input)\n        \n        # 4. If user references deeper spiritual / heart-based concerns\n        if self.should_invoke_sufi_heart(user_input):\n            response += self.sufi_heart_helper.offer_heart_reflection(user_input)\n        \n        # 5. Values tracker runs in background, updating scores, evidence\n        self.values_tracker.update_from_conversation(user_input)\n        \n        return response\n\n# Each module can have its own internal logic:\nclass JournalModule:\n    def check_in(self, user_input):\n        # Collect \"Energy, Tasks, Blocks, Small Action\" etc.\n        return \"Short daily check-in response...\"\n\nclass ReflectionModule:\n    def dive_deeper(self, user_input):\n        # Nudges user to explore patterns, meta-level blocks\n        return \"Deeper reflection or open-ended questions...\"\n\nclass ValuesTracker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.values_cards = {}  # e.g., \"family_connection\": {score: 0.7, evidence: [...]}\n    \n    def update_from_conversation(self, user_input):\n        # If user references family goals or heartfelt desires, increment confidence\n        pass\n\nclass CBT_ACT_Helper:\n    def offer_technique(self, user_input):\n        # Suggest acceptance or defusion exercise if user is stuck in negative thought loops\n        return \"Let's practice a quick acceptance step...\"\n\nclass SufiHeartHelper:\n    def offer_heart_reflection(self, user_input):\n        # Suggest noticing bodily sensations, possible veils/fears\n        return \"Focus on your chest, notice any subtle tension or warmth...\"\n```\n\n### Key Points\n1. **Modular**: The system doesn’t always push CBT, or always push spiritual reflection—it “listens” for cues in the conversation to decide which facet is most helpful.  \n2. **Background Values Tracking**: Like building “values cards” with confidence scores based on user expressions. Over time, the system gently reflects these back (“I’ve noticed family reconnection comes up often—does that feel right?”).  \n3. **Check-in + Reflection**: A core daily loop that’s always there, with deeper modules available on demand or triggered by user signals.  \n4. **Patterns & Blockages**: The system monitors repeated loops (avoidance patterns) and may shift to a more challenging stance, gently confronting the user with, “You mentioned this same block last week—want to explore why it’s so persistent?”  \n\n---\n\n## Closing Note\n\n**NURTURER**  \nThis short treatise and the diagrams aim to capture the essence of how thoughts, emotions, habits, and character shape our destiny, while also recognizing we can reflect backward from destiny to reconfigure our thoughts and actions. We honor the Sufi emphasis on purifying the heart as well as CBT/ACT’s practical, values-based action steps.  \n\n**CHALLENGER**  \nNow that you have a more explicit philosophical + technical map, notice if there’s any lingering hesitation. You’ve sought clarity, and here’s a cohesive blueprint. Perhaps the next brave step is to trust you have “enough” and let your partial, imperfect prototype begin shaping reality. The real nuance emerges **in use**—through the friction of real data and real emotions. Are you ready to implement a small slice of this grand vision and adjust as you learn?  \n\n---\n\nThat’s our integrated overview: a philosophical foundation uniting Sufi heart-centered wisdom, CBT/ACT’s pragmatic approach, and a dynamic prompt architecture. The meta-prompt concept ensures the system remains responsive to user needs rather than forcing a single mode.  \n\nIf you spot anything missing or want a deeper dive into any piece (e.g., code expansion, more detail on the psych frameworks, or how to store user progress), let me know. Otherwise, you now have a comprehensive lens on how “thoughts → actions → habits → character → destiny” can be both conceptually mapped and practically built into an adaptive system.",
