Our task is to identify a list of a variety of tasks that they need to do and find ways that AI tools, particularly large language models, can help them. Ask questions you need to deepen your understanding. Our goal is to make a table with a list of tasks in one column and a % time column, a column with how it can be helped by AI followed by a % reduction in time column.",

      "content": "Thank you for explaining our goal. To get started, I'd like to ask some questions to better understand the needs and challenges of social enterprises and nonprofits:\n\n- What are some of the main day-to-day tasks and operations that take up a lot of time for these organizations? Things like fundraising, grant writing, reporting, communications, program management etc.? \n\n- Where do they tend to get bogged down with busywork and administrative tasks? What prevents them from spending more time on their core mission and programs?\n\n- How familiar are they currently with AI and its capabilities to assist with various tasks? Would training/change management need to be factored in?\n\n- What are some of the biggest pain points and frustrations for their staff and volunteers? Where could AI provide the most relief or value?\n\n- What level of investment can they reasonably make in AI tools and services? Are they open to AI assistance or skeptical?\n\n- Are there any concerns around data privacy, security or ethics when it comes to AI utilization? \n\nOnce I understand their needs and challenges better, I can start compiling a list of potential tasks that AI could assist with, estimate time savings, and make thoughtful recommendations on how to implement AI responsibly. Please share any details you have on their current situation and needs. I'm happy to keep asking questions until we're ready to build out the table.",
