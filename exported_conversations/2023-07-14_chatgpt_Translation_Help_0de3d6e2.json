As if life\nwere a progressive and cunning crime\nwith no witness to the tiny hidden\ntransgressions. To feel abandoned is to deny\nthe intimacy of your surroundings. Surely,\neven you, at times, have felt the grand array;\nthe swelling presence, and the chorus, crowding\nout your solo voice. You must note\nthe way the soap dish enables you,\nor the window latch grants you freedom.\nAlertness is the hidden discipline of familiarity.\nThe stairs are your mentor of things\nto come, the doors have always been there\nto frighten you and invite you,\nand the tiny speaker in the phone\nis your dream-ladder to divinity.\n\nPut down the weight of your aloneness and ease into the\nconversation. The kettle is singing\neven as it pours you a drink, the cooking pots\nhave left their arrogant aloofness and\nseen the good in you at last. All the birds\nand creatures of the world are unutterably\nthemselves. Everything is waiting for you.\n\n ",
