Food prices increased due to a\ndrought linked to climate change.\n\nPeer discussions:\nWhat are the main challenges Iraq faces due to climate change?\n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\n○ The impact of climate change, particularly in causing droughts and increased\ndesertification, has become increasingly evident in recent years in Iraq and Syria,\nwhich together form the two limbs of what is known as the \"Fertile Crescent.”\n○ A direct consequence of the increased aridity, which is strongly felt, is the occurrence\nof sandstorms. According to the United Nations report, it indicates that the Iraqi\nMinistry of Environment has recorded 122 dust storms and 283 dusty days in 2012\nand it estimates that this will increase to 300 dusty days per year in the next ten\nyears.\n\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nBy the end of this century, the \"Fertile Crescent\" could lose its current shape and might even disappear\naltogether. The area shown in the picture experienced one of the most devastating droughts in decades during\n2007-2008, which scientists have linked to climate change. This severe drought affected much of Syria and\nnorthern Iraq during what is typically the wettest time of the year.\n\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\n● Dust storms have increased\nby 10x over the since the\n1990s.\n● Dust storms have resulted in\nthe closure of airports and\nhospitalizations resulting\nfrom dust-induced\nrespiratory illnesses.\n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nWater Scarcities\n● Water withdrawals in riparian\ncountries, particularly Turkey, Iran, and\nto a lesser extent Syria, are increasing\ndue to rising demand. According to the\nIraqi Ministry of Water Resources,\nfuture projections under climate\nchange indicate worsening conditions\nfor the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\nStudies suggest the Euphrates-Tigris\ndischarge could decline by 9.5%\nbetween 2040 and 2069, with some\nestimates predicting up to a 73%\nreduction in the Euphrates River's\nannual flow.\n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nSea Level Rise (SLR)\n○ The rise in sea levels due to climate change is likely to impact many coastal areas and\ninundate low-lying regions. The most concerning area is the Basrah Governorate,\nwhich includes seven districts.\n○ Reduced river flow, combined with rising sea levels, has led to higher salinity in the\nrivers, harming agriculture, livestock, and the people who depend on them.\n○ Seawater has reached as far as 189 kilometers upstream from the Persian Gulf,\ndestroying 24,000 hectares of agricultural land and 30,000 trees.\n○ Without fresh water to dilute them, pollutants from agriculture, the oil and gas\nindustry, and sewage have become more concentrated.\n\n\n\n\n\nSea Level Rise (SLR)\nSea Level Rise (SLR) above the Mean Sea Level (MSL) may cause a significant hazard to Basrah’s\ncoastal areas because of its low-lying floodplains\n● 1 M sea level rise (as shown in blue color) is\nlikely to affect most of the eastern part of the\nIraqi coast.\n● The affected area under 1 M sea level rise\nwould be 944 km2 (5% of total Basrah’ area).\n\nPeer discussions:\nWhat role does housing play in a sustainable future?\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nWaste Generation\n● Iraq is expected to generate 31,000 tons\nof solid waste along with construction\nwaste each day by per capita waste\ngeneration surpassing 1.4 kg per day.\n● Additionally, many illegal landfills for\ndumping of the waste including\nConstruction and Demolition (C&D)\nwaste reported.\n\nWaste Generation\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nResource Depletion\n○ Poor water management, reduced river inflows from neighboring countries, population\ngrowth, inefficient water use in oil and agriculture, and conflicts have led to water\ninsecurity for at least 7 million Iraqis.\n○ The Euphrates and Tigris, providing 98% of Iraq’s water, have lost 30% of their flow\nsince the 1980s, with projections of a 50% decline by 2030. The 2020-2021 rainfall\nseason, one of the driest in 40 years, caused a 29% reduction in Tigris flow and 73% in\nthe Euphrates.\n\nResource Depletion\nWater reduction is increasingly damaging agriculture and its farmers, especially since around 75%\nof the population in agricultural areas work in crop production, mainly wheat and barley.\n\nResource Depletion - Lake Sawa\nThe geological and environmental significance of Lake Sawa in Iraq’s natural landscape made it a popular tourist\nattraction for decades. However, the once-mesmerizing lake, thousands of years old, is now nothing more than\na wasteland.\n\nResource Depletion - Lake Sawa\nThe geological and environmental significance of Lake Sawa in Iraq’s natural landscape made it a popular tourist\nattraction for decades. However, the once-mesmerizing lake, thousands of years old, is now nothing more than\na wasteland.\n\nWaste Generation\nSolid Waste\n● Solid waste is a comprehensive\nexpression which contains the\nundesirable or unusable solid\nmaterials obtained from industrial,\nresidential and commercial exercises\nin a particular zone.\n\nWaste Generation\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nModern Construction Methods\n● High energy and water consumption.\n● Environmental pollution from\nresource-intensive construction.\n● Degradation of natural resources.\nSustainable Alternatives\n● Reduce energy, water, and resource\nconsumption.\n● Promote environmental preservation.\n● Foster a sustainable culture in the\nconstruction industry.\n● Rising energy prices highlight the need\nfor sustainable practices.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nEnvironmental pollution\n● Iraq heavily relies on fossil fuels, with over 80% of electricity coming from oil and gas, contributing to\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental degradation.\n● In 2021, energy consumption per person was 1.3 toe/person, with 1030 kWh of electricity used per person.\nTotal energy use increased by 12% (50 Mtoe) in 2021.\n● 77% of energy use in 2021 came from oil, 23% from gas, and only 4% from renewables.\n● CO2 emissions increased by 69% from 2009 to 2018.\n● Electricity, heat producers, transport, and households are the top contributors to emissions.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nEnvironmental pollution\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nIn 2018, a total of 85.9 Mt CO2 was emitted from the electricity and heat generation sectors. The oil sector is the\nsource of 73% of the emissions, while the natural gas sector accounts for the remainder.. Most of the air pollution is\ncaused by the leakage of industrial waste and traffic fumes\n\n\n\nCarbon Emissions Per Person\n● Peak electricity demand has\nsurged by 46% in recent years due\nto prolonged, extremely hot\nsummers and is expected to keep\nrising.\n● Fossil fuel reliance and a decline in\nhydropower have driven a 194%\nincrease in CO2 emissions over\nthe past two decades.\n\nElectricity Supply and Demand\nIraq’s power grid inefficiencies during peak summer months result in frequent power cuts, leading to reliance on costly 9,\ncosting up to $4 billion annually in 2018.\nTo meet future demand, measures include improving distribution networks, reducing losses, increasing capacity with mobile\ngenerators, utilizing captured gas, and boosting renewable energy sources to supply 24-hour power by 2030.\n\nRelationship between Housing and Climate Change\n● Displacement Due to Environmental Degradation: The depletion of the Tigris and Euphrates\nrivers is forcing rural populations to migrate to urban areas, straining housing infrastructure.\n● Impact of Sand and Dust Storms on Housing: Dust storms are damaging building materials,\nincreasing the need for housing repairs.\n● Energy Inefficiency in Traditional Housing: Modern housing methods lack energy efficiency,\nincreasing energy consumption for cooling.\n● Urban Heat and Cooling Demands: The need for cooling systems during hot summers has led to\nhigher energy demands, especially in inefficient housing.\n\nOk, where is the good news?\nPeer discussions:\nWhat are some possible solutions the housing sector can provide?\n\nPart 2\nSolar Energy and Energy\nModeling\n\nHome Energy Consumption\nDo you know how much energy does an average house use?\nSpecifically, how many kilowatt-hours (kWh) does a house typically use?\nThe energy consumption of a house can vary significantly based on numerous factors. These factors include\nlifestyle choices, the number of individuals residing in the household, the construction of the house, its\ngeographical location, and various other variables. Each of these elements contributes to the overall energy usage\nand should be considered when assessing a house's electricity consumption.\n\nMost Energy-Consuming Components\nHeating\nCooling\nLighting\nAppliances\n\nEnergy Consumption in\nTraditional Building\nDesigns in Iraq\n\nEnergy Consumption in Traditional Building Designs in Iraq\n\nEnergy Consumption in Traditional Building Designs in Iraq\n● Reference Building Overview\n○ Design: Single-family house for 6-7\nmembers - 5 bedrooms, kitchen, living\nroom, guest room, 2 bathrooms, 3 toilets,\ngarage, garden, and courtyard\n● Orientation: South-north, with the main facade\nfacing south\n● Construction:\n○ 24-cm brick load-bearing walls, gypsum\nplaster interior, stone-clad exterior 15-cm\nreinforced concrete roof with insulation\nSingle-glazed aluminum windows with\ngrilles\n● Energy Load:\n○ Heating: 43.68 kWh/m²a (Peak: 9,608 W on\nJanuary 13th)\n○ Cooling: 98.09 kWh/m²a (Peak: 16,989 W on\nSeptember 16th)\n\nEnergy Consumption in Traditional Building Designs in Iraq\nThe psychrometric chart shows some of the measures to be implemented to optimise the building such as thermal mass, shading and passive solar\ngains. However, this section will deal only with the reduction of loads without including HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning system).\n\nEnergy Consumption in Traditional Building Designs in Iraq\nThe table shows the thermal loads for the alternatives. The most efficient material alternative was the ICF structure with double glazed windows. However,\nthe ICF (insulated concrete form) structure is a concrete construction which is highly energy intensive in the production phase which may make it not the\nbest alternative if the whole process is taken into account. It is also not very widespread because it is relatively new in the market and there is only one\nfactory in Iraq.\n\nEnergy Usage in a Home in Iraq\n\nIraq: Per capita: what is the average energy consumption per\nperson?\n2023\n15.333 kWh\n\nCost Analysis in Air Conditioner and Lights\nAir Conditioner (A/C): The inverter conditioner units might be more expensive than the constant motor speed type,\nbut this is balanced by less electricity bills. In picture showing a comparison between the types of A/C with and\nwithout inverter considering power for same cooling capacity, A/C cost, bill cost over a period of time and total cost\nso it is worth noting that the most appropriate is to use A/C with inverter technique for power and money saving.\n2,916\n4,200\n12 months\n8,700\n9,216\n\nCost Analysis in Air Conditioner and Lights\nLights: The one of most efficient bulbs in the market are called compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs. The newest\ntechnology is light-emitting diodes (LEDs) the best energy save lighting technology are solid-state devices that\nconvert electric energy directly into light of a single color. The newest technology is light-emitting diodes (LEDs) the\nbest energy save lighting technology are solid-state devices that convert electric energy directly into light of a single\ncolor.\n\nEnergy Usage in a Home in Iraq\nElectricity is considered the prime source of energy for households in Iraq. Split type or window mounted\nair conditioners are used for cooling. Fans and evaporative coolers are more common in low-mid income\nhouses. Kerosene heaters are dominantly used during winters due to lack of electricity supply. Domestic\nsolar water heater (SWH) is seldom used in Iraq despite it could be a major contributor to the future energy\nsupply.\n\nEnergy Usage in a Home in Iraq\n● The average monthly consumption for a medium income household for summer and winter months\nranges on average between 1,400 – 1,900 kWh per connection per month.\n● The monthly electricity consumption is calculated based on each connection using basic appliances\nsuch as refrigerators, washing machines, TVs, irons, lightings and one split type air conditioner and\nair evaporator during summer months as well as a hot water cylinder and electrical heater during\nwinter months.\n\nMoving from Traditional Inefficiencies to Renewable Solutions\nOur next focus topic today covers:\n1. Renewable Energy:\na. Solar Energy: Photovoltaic (PV) Systems, Irradiation Modeling, House Orientation,\nand Passive Solar Design\nb. Solar Thermal: Solar Water Heaters\n2. Energy Modeling\n\nRenewable Energy\nRenewable Energy:\nSolar, wind, and geothermal provide clean,\nreliable energy.\nReduces dependence on fossil fuels and\nmitigates climate change.\nFossil fuels deplete quickly and emit\ngreenhouse gases, harming the planet and\nhuman health.\n\nIraq Renewable Energy\nIraq's Power Sector Challenges\n● Over 80% of electricity relies on fossil fuels, causing frequent shortages and blackouts.\n● Many regions depend on polluting diesel generators due to outdated infrastructure.\n● Iraq has over 3,000 hours of solar radiance annually, with solar intensity ranging from 416\nW/m² (January) to 833 W/m² (June).\n● Despite minimal renewable use, a directive aims to increase solar energy adoption.\n\nIraq Renewable Energy\n\nIraq Renewable Energy\nIn 2018, only 2% of the electricity generation mix came from renewables. Iraq targets a renewable energy share of\n10% in the electricity sector by 2030 and a long-term target (time frame is not further defined) of 40% to overcome\nthe challenge of undersupply. It is estimated that solar PV will account for 42% of the total renewable energy mix\nby 2025.\n\nSolar Energy\nSolar radiation, also called the electromagnetic radiation, is emitted by the sun. This light and\nradiation emitted is harnessed using a variety of technologies such as solar power to convert it into\nelectricity or other forms of energy.\nToday solar energy is not only considered as an alternative power source, but is thought of as a\ngreener, more efficient and cost-effective solution to power homes, offices & commercial buildings.\n\nSolar Energy\nPhotovoltaic (PV) Systems Solar Thermal Systems\nSolar Insulation Techniques \nEnergy-Efficient Air\nConditioning Systems\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) Systems\nSolar photovoltaic (PV) systems generate electricity from sunlight. Solar PV cells that capture\nsunlight are placed in panels, which are in turn placed in arrays, to deliver solar power to homes and\nbusinesses.\nA solar PV system has 2 main components: the solar panels and the inverter.\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) Systems\nThe Solar Panels:\nSolar panels contain silicon cells that convert sunlight to DC electricity via the photovoltaic effect.\nPanel efficiency is measured by the ratio of energy output to input. All panels experience initial\nperformance degradation before stabilizing.\nThere are several types of cells most commonly used for households:\n● Monocrystalline cells are sliced from a single large silicon crystal (an ingot). These are very\nefficient (15–20% efficiency).\n● Polycrystalline cells are made by pouring silicone into moulds (cast ingots). Polycrystalline\ncells have slightly lower efficiency than monocrystalline cells (13–17%); but this can be\ncompensated for by using larger installations.\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) Systems\nThe Solar Panels:\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) Systems\nThe Inverters:\nThe inverter converts the DC electricity produced by the solar panels into AC electricity for use in a\nhome or business.\nThere are 4 types of inverter most commonly used for households:\n● String inverters are single units attached to a string of solar panels; these are the most\ncommon type for households.\n● Micro inverters are attached to each panel; these are a good option when some panels are\nsometimes shaded but are more expensive than string inverters.\n● Battery-only inverters are paired with chargers to store ‘surplus’ electrical energy in a battery\nand release it later when it is more useful or economic.\n● Hybrid inverters combine a string inverter and battery inverter in a single unit.\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) Systems\nThe Inverters:\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) Systems in Iraq\nSolar PV systems are among the most efficient means of generating electricity in Iraq. Iraq and most\ncountries have started to use PV panels to generate electrical energy. The rate of solar irradiation\nincident in the south and middle of Iraq is high. The average daily irradiation in Baghdad is\napproximately 5.27 kWh/m2/day.\nEnvironmentally, the solar PV system can approximately decrease 1613900 kg of CO2 production\nduring the lifetime of solar PV panels.\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) Systems in Iraq\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) Systems in Iraq\n\nIrradiation Modeling and House Orientation\nIrradiation modeling refers to the process of simulating the amount of solar energy (irradiance) that\nstrikes a particular surface, such as a rooftop, over a specific period.\nThis model helps predict how much solar energy is available in a particular geographic location and\nunder specific weather conditions. By understanding this, solar energy systems, such as solar\nphotovoltaic (PV) panels, can be optimized to maximize energy generation.\nSolar irradiance is the output of energy from the sun received at an area on the Earth. It is measured\nin W/m² (Watts per meter squared) in the form of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nIrradiation Modeling and House Orientation\nMaximizing solar energy efficiency depends on house orientation and solar irradiation modeling.\nModeling helps determine the best orientation to capture sunlight throughout the day and across\nseasons.\nTools like National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) - PVWatts Calculator User can estimate\nsolar energy output and optimize panel placement.\nUse the PVWatts Calculator (https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/index.php)\n\nPassive Solar Design\nPassive systems collect, store, and distribute solar energy without mechanical or electrical devices.\nOptimizes comfort in all seasons—winter sun warms interiors, while shading and thermal mass\nprevent summer overheating.\n5 Key Principles of Passive Solar Design:\n● Building orientation towards true south\n● Energy efficient windows\n● Calculated roof overhangs\n● Large thermal mass for energy storage\n● Suitable walls and roof insulation\n\nPassive Solar Design\n\nConnection Between Passive Solar Design, Irradiation Modeling,\nand House Orientation\nIrradiation modeling\ninforms optimal house\norientation by providing\ndata on solar patterns\nProper house orientation is\ncrucial for effective passive\nsolar design\nPassive solar design\nstrategies are refined\nbased on irradiation data\nand orientation choices\n\nSolar Thermal Systems\nWhat’s the difference between solar thermal and solar PV?\nSimply put, solar thermal installations use the sun’s heat to make electricity, whereas solar\nphotovoltaic installations use the sun’s light to make electricity.\nSolar thermal panels or solar collectors are devices that are mounted on your roof to absorb the\nsun’s heat and use it to heat up water, stored in a cylinder. The liquid flowing through the panels is a\nmix of water and antifreeze.\n\nSolar Thermal Systems\nSolar thermal systems are used to heat water for households and for larger hot water consumers\nsuch as hotels and hospitals.\n\nSolar Thermal Systems\nThere are two main types of solar thermal panels:\n● Flat-plate collectors: Resemble solar PV panels with a dark absorbing surface, transparent\ncover, and heat-insulating backing. Use a fluid to transfer heat from the absorber to a water\ntank.\n● Evacuated (or vacuum) tube collectors: Consist of several glass tubes that transport fluid.\nMore efficient in cold climates but may overheat in warm weather, reducing efficiency.\n\nSolar Thermal Systems vs Solar Water Heating\n● Solar Thermal: This technology refers to the use of solar energy to generate heat, which can\nbe used for various applications such as heating water, space heating, or even power\ngeneration in solar thermal power plants.\n● Solar Water Heating: This is a specific application of solar thermal technology that focuses\nsolely on using solar energy to heat water for residential or commercial use.\n\nSolar Water Heating\n● Cost-effective devices for providing hot water in residential, commercial, and utility buildings.\n● Available in various configurations for different applications.\n● Studies show solar water heating is economically viable for domestic use worldwide.\n● Installed in some homes in Mosul, SWHs reduce—though don't completely eliminate—the\nneed for electric or fossil fuel-based water heating.\n\nSolar Water Heating\nSolar water heaters are cost-effective devices for supplying hot water in residential, commercial,\nand utility buildings. This mature technology comes in various configurations to suit different\napplications. Recent studies show that solar water heating is economically viable in many parts of\nthe world for domestic use.\nThere are two types of solar water heating systems:\n● Active, which have circulating pumps and controls\n● Passive, which don't have circulating pumps and controls\n\nSolar Water Heating\nActive Solar Water Heating Systems\n● Direct circulation systems: Pumps circulate household water through the collectors and into\nthe home. They work well in climates where it rarely freezes.\n● Indirect circulation systems: Pumps circulate a non-freezing, heat-transfer fluid through the\ncollectors and a heat exchanger. This heats the water that then flows into the home. They are\npopular in climates prone to freezing temperatures.\n\nSolar Water Heating\nPassive Solar Water Heating Systems\nLess expensive than active systems, but usually less efficient. More reliable and can last longer.\nTypes of Passive Systems:\n● Integral collector-storage passive systems: Storage tank heats water via sunlight and supplies\nit to the plumbing system. Ideal for regions with mild climates and high hot-water demand.\n● Thermosyphon systems: Water is heated in a roof-mounted collector and flows through the\nsystem when a faucet is opened. Typical capacity: 40 gallons.\n\nSolar Water Heating\nPassive Solar Water Heating Systems\n\nSolar Water Heating in Iraq\nSolar water heaters (SWHS) were installed in some houses in Mosul. SWHS reduce, but don't\neliminate, the need for electric or fossil fuel water heating.\nEnergy consumption for water heating was measured for a full year:\n● Without SWHS: 32.29%\n● With SWHS: 13.1%\n● Key finding: SWHS reduced energy consumption for water heating by 19.19%\nThe effectiveness of SWHS depends on:\n● Solar radiation intensity\n● Technical characteristics of the system\n● Load characteristics\nA small 1 kW electric heater was added to the\nsolar heater for backup heating.\n\nSolar Water Heating System (SWHS)\n● Highest solar energy in June & July: 5.8–7.6 kWh/m²/day. Lowest solar energy in December:\n2.5–2.8 kWh/m²/day. Long-term average global horizontal irradiation: 5.0–5.8\nkWh/m²/day. Encourages the use of Solar Water Heating Systems (SWHS) in Iraq.\n● Implementation of SWHS:\n○ Installing SWHS on rooftops can reduce or eliminate electricity consumption for\nheating residential water.\n\nSolar Water Heating System (SWHS)\nDescription of the system\n● Thermosiphon Solar Water Heater in Kurdistan, Iraq\n● Location: Erbil, Kurdistan region\n● System Components:\n○ Flat plate solar collector: 2.01 m², facing south at a 40° inclination\n○ Hot water storage tank: 200L, insulated\n○ Cold water storage tank: 2000L\n○ Optional 3 KW electric heater for low solar insolation\n\nWhy Solar Energy for Housing?\n● Free energy source:\nSun provides renewable, and inexhaustible energy, potentially saving money long-term.\n● Environmentally friendly:\nClean power source that reduces carbon emissions and eliminates harmful gas production.\n● Reduces energy losses:\nMinimizes transmission losses by generating power closer to consumption points.\n● Versatile installation:\nCan be installed anywhere with sunlight access, including rarely used spaces like rooftops.\n● Revenue generation:\nSome governments incentivize solar energy use by purchasing excess power from\nhomeowners.\n● Sustainable future:\nHelps conserve natural resources and provides a long-term sustainable energy solution.\n\nIraq Solar Energy\n● Between 2014 and 2018, Iraq lost 7GW (30%) of its electricity generation and transmission due\nto terrorism causing billions of dollars damages in infrastructure.\n● It is estimated that Iraq had spent over $80 billion on the electricity sector over the past 20\nyears without achieving any noticeable progress.\n● Iraq’s capacity for generating electricity is about 19 GW in 2019. The estimated needed power\nsupply to meet the required demand is set at 28 GW and can reach 30GW at peak in summer,\nand the projected energy consumption is predicted to double by the next ten years\n\nSolar Energy Feasibility in The Iraqi Market\nIn the last decade, the cost of generating electricity by solar panels has dropped significantly.\nThe cost of generating one watt by solar panels dropped from $8 in 2008 to just $2 in 2018. This is\nthe lowest cost of solar systems ever got in the last 30 years\n\nSolar Energy Feasibility in The\nIraqi Market\nIraq’s sunny days can reach up to 300 days a\nyear, making the solar energy option very\neffective and efficient.\nIn addition to the very high irradiation level\nthat can reach up to 1900 KWh/m2/year (5\nKWh/m2/day) which makes the country one\nof the most attractive spots for solar energy\nadoption.\n\nPart 3\nHow to Reduce Energy\nCosts?\n\nSolar energy is a powerful tool for reducing energy consumption, but its potential is\nmaximized when combined with energy modeling. Energy modeling allows homeowners and\nbuilders to simulate different energy scenarios\n\nEnergy Modeling\nEnergy Modeling is physics-based software simulation of building energy use. It allows architects\nand engineers to foresee via simulation how a structure will interact with its environment,\nanticipate energy consumption, and optimize components for efficiency.\nEnergy-Analysis or Energy-modeling is used to:\n● Predict the monthly energy consumption and bills\n● Predict the annual energy cost\n● Annual CO2 emissions\n● Compare and contrast different efficiency options\n● Determine life cycle payback on various options\n\nEnergy Modeling in Construction\nEnergy modeling has significantly evolved over the years, driven by technological advancements,\nenvironmental concerns, and the need for energy-efficient buildings.\nEarly Stages:\n● Basic Calculations: Manual or spreadsheet-based calculations estimated energy consumption using simple parameters\nlike size and orientation.\n● Building Energy Simulation Software: Software like EnergyPlus and DOE-2 emerged, providing more accurate\npredictions.\nIntegrated Design and Performance Standards:\n● Integrated Design: Energy modeling became part of the design process to evaluate different options.\n● Performance-Based Codes: Building codes incorporated energy performance requirements, and tools like LEED and\nBREEAM were introduced.\n\nEnergy Modeling in Construction\nAdvanced Tools and Techniques:\n● Parametric and Optimization Tools: Explore design options and optimize energy performance.\n● Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning: Use historical data for more accurate, real-time predictions.\n● Whole-Building Life Cycle Assessment: Consider the entire building's life cycle, including embodied energy\nand emissions.\nDigital Transformation:\n● Cloud-Based Platforms: Enhanced collaboration and data sharing.\n● Digital Twins and Building Performance Monitoring: Virtual replicas allow continuous monitoring and\noptimization.\n● Smart Grid Integration: Incorporate demand response and renewable energy into energy modeling.\n\nPractical Steps for Implementing Energy Modeling\n1.

            "text": " I'll summarize the goal, think through the process, and then ask you some questions to help design the module assessment form. Let's begin:\n\nGoal Summary:\nThe goal is to create an expert assessment form for validating a curriculum on sustainable reconstruction and housing in Iraq. This assessment is part of a larger process aimed at potential certification and government acceptance of the curriculum.\n\nStep-by-step thought process:\n1. Review the contract (Terms of Reference) to ensure alignment with project objectives.\n2. Analyze the module content and overall curriculum structure.\n3. Identify key competencies and learning outcomes the curriculum aims to develop.\n4. Consider industry standards and best practices in sustainable construction and housing.\n5. Think about the Iraqi context and specific challenges mentioned in the materials.\n6. Determine what quantitative and qualitative data would be most valuable for validation.\n7. Consider how to balance brevity with comprehensiveness in the assessment form.\n8. Think about how to structure questions to get actionable feedback for improvement.\n9. Consider including a mix of rating scales, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions.\n10. Think about how to assess both content relevance and pedagogical effectiveness.\n\nNow, I'll ask you 5 questions to help design the first pass of the module assessment form:\n\n1. Who are the specific experts you plan to engage for this assessment (e.g., industry professionals, academics, government officials)?\n\n2. Are there any specific accreditation or certification standards in Iraq that this curriculum needs to align with?\n\n3. How many questions do you think would be appropriate for the assessment form, considering the experts' time constraints?\n\n4. Are there any particular areas of the curriculum that you're especially concerned about and want to focus on in the assessment?\n\n5. Do you want to include any questions about the practical applicability of the curriculum in the Iraqi context?\n\nFeedback on how to do this best:\nTo create an effective assessment form, consider the following:\n\n1. Start with a brief introduction explaining the purpose of the assessment and how the feedback will be used.\n\n2. Use a mix of question types: Likert scales for quick quantitative feedback, multiple-choice for specific aspects, and open-ended questions for detailed qualitative feedback.\n\n3. Group questions by themes (e.g., content relevance, pedagogical approach, practical applicability).\n\n4. Include questions that assess both the individual modules and the curriculum as a whole.\n\n5. Provide space for general comments at the end of the form.\n\n6. Pilot the assessment form with a small group before sending it to all experts to ensure clarity and effectiveness.\n\n7. Consider creating an online version of the form for ease of completion and data collection.\n\n8. Ensure that the assessment aligns with the specific objectives outlined in your Terms of Reference.\n\n9. Include questions that address the innovative aspects of your curriculum, such as the focus on solar energy and energy modeling.\n\n10. Consider adding a section for experts to rate the curriculum's potential impact on the sustainable construction industry in Iraq.",

      "content": "can we add anything to potentially align with the green zuggarat rating system? Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS) Overview The Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS) is a sustainable development assessment system implemented by the University of Mosul in collaboration with the College of Engineering. This system is designed to evaluate the sustainability levels of existing and new buildings. The GZRS is intended as a local rating system that will be formulated and applied within the context of Mosul and Iraq. Project Description The Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS) is named after the ziggurats, which were iconic structures in ancient Mesopotamian architecture, symbolizing the unique historical and cultural identity of Iraq. The ziggurat, an Akkadian word meaning \"the high place,\" has become emblematic of Iraqi architectural heritage. The system will provide a standardized national benchmark to assess the sustainability of buildings, helping to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of construction and promoting a sustainable architectural approach. The objectives of the system include: Providing a national standard: This will help in assessing the sustainability level of buildings and provide unified national results to achieve sustainability. Reducing environmental impacts: The system aims to reduce the negative environmental effects of buildings. Raising awareness: The system will enhance awareness among the community regarding the environmental aspects of sustainability and the importance of sustainable buildings. Preserving identity: The system seeks to preserve and highlight the architectural and cultural identity of Iraq.

Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS) Overview The Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS) is a sustainable development assessment system implemented by the University of Mosul in collaboration with the College of Engineering. This system is designed to evaluate the sustainability levels of existing and new buildings. The GZRS is intended as a local rating system that will be formulated and applied within the context of Mosul and Iraq. Project Description The Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS) is named after the ziggurats, which were iconic structures in ancient Mesopotamian architecture, symbolizing the unique historical and cultural identity of Iraq. The ziggurat, an Akkadian word meaning \"the high place,\" has become emblematic of Iraqi architectural heritage. The system will provide a standardized national benchmark to assess the sustainability of buildings, helping to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of construction and promoting a sustainable architectural approach. The objectives of the system include: Providing a national standard: This will help in assessing the sustainability level of buildings and provide unified national results to achieve sustainability. Reducing environmental impacts: The system aims to reduce the negative environmental effects of buildings. Raising awareness: The system will enhance awareness among the community regarding the environmental aspects of sustainability and the importance of sustainable buildings. Preserving identity: The system seeks to preserve and highlight the architectural and cultural identity of Iraq. Details and Rating Criteria The GZRS assesses projects based on their adherence to sustainable development principles. It provides a comprehensive evaluation by examining various dimensions such as energy efficiency, resource management, and environmental impact. The system is designed to encourage improvements in sustainable practices across university projects. Rating Criteria The GZRS includes a detailed scoring system that evaluates projects according to multiple criteria, as illustrated in the following table: Criterion Percentage Energy Efficiency 10% Resource Management 28% Environmental Impact 32% Water Efficiency 12% Waste Management 18% Sustainable Building Materials 10% Sustainable Transportation 5% Innovation in Design 105% Visual Indicators The system uses visual indicators to demonstrate the overall rating of projects: 60-70%: 5-level Ziggurat Rating System 48-60%: 4-level Ziggurat Rating System 40-48%: 3-level Ziggurat Rating System 35-40%: 2-level Ziggurat Rating System 30-35%: 1-level Ziggurat Rating System Certificates Certificates will be awarded to buildings based on their sustainability rating, according to the following scale: 85-100 Points: N/A (Top Level Certificate) 70-84 Points: 4-Level Ziggurat Certificate 60-69 Points: 3-Level Ziggurat Certificate 50-59 Points: 2-Level Ziggurat Certificate 40-49 Points: 1-Level Ziggurat Certificate Participants Prof. Dr. Qusay Kamal al-Din al-Ahmadi Prof. Dr. Abd al-Rahim Ibrahim Jassem Dr. Riham Ali Talib al-Shammari Dr. Basim Ihsan Abd al-Qadir al-Hafiz Eng.
