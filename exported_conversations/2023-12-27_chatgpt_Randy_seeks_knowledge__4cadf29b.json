As for the \"why\" of my knowledge: I'm designed to assist and provide information across a vast array of topics based on a wide range of pre-existing data up to my last update in April 2023. I don't \"know\" in the human sense, but I can generate responses based on patterns and information in the data I was trained on. What would you like to know today?",
