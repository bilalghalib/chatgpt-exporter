We'll go through each question one at a time in a simple, conversational style to make sure your answers are clear and focused. Once we’ve covered all the relevant questions, I’ll compile your responses into a well-formatted document for easy submission. Let me know when you're ready to start, and I'll ask the first question!\n\n16:52\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nAll right, so if we're ready to go, remember to start asking me questions and try to make me look good in front of the person reading the application. Remember, I'm Bilal Ghalib, the founder of a social entrepreneurship accelerator and program based out of the Middle East called bloom.pm. You can find us online. We run well-being for well-doing and impact entrepreneurship programs.\n16:52\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nGot it, Bilal! Let’s start with the first question to help you shine in this application.\n\nQuestion 1: What is your advanced university degree (Master's or higher), and how is it relevant to the fields of culture, international relations, political science, engineering, or a related field?\n\n16:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI have a master's degree in learning sciences from an interdisciplinary master's in Paris, and I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics and a minor in philosophy from the University of Michigan in Michigan in the United States, and I have been working in this field for a while. So I am also recently just out of MOSLED, where I was working for the UN through the International Trade Center on post-conflict reconstruction curriculums, developing curriculums to figure out how to build MOSLED again after the destruction from ISIS.\n16:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nGreat, here's how I’ll frame this for your application:\n\nYou have a Master’s degree in Learning Sciences from an interdisciplinary program in Paris, complemented by a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Philosophy from the University of Michigan, USA. Your academic background and professional experience converge in the fields of cultural preservation and post-conflict recovery. Notably, through your recent work with MOSLED for the UN's International Trade Center, you contributed to post-conflict reconstruction curriculums, addressing rebuilding efforts in Mosul following the destruction caused by ISIS.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to adjust anything! Ready for the next question?\n\n16:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, I'm ready for the next question. I don't think you have to put all of that in the university section. I think they're just asking for what you studied, but I would like to sort of demonstrate somehow that my studies were relevant because it was through my studies. I did a master's degree while I was studying my entrepreneurship program in Lebanon, and we were studying the impact of the Beirut blast on the participants. And so, working in conflict areas and trying to bring together my technical background and my interest in education and interest in community building altogether for positive change has been a big question, and I don't really have strong networks in specifically post-conflict rubble remodeling, but I'm definitely confident I can figure these things out.\n16:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nGot it! I’ll keep the focus on your academic qualifications for this section, while subtly weaving in how they connect to your relevant work and broader expertise. Here's the refined version:\n\nYou hold a Master’s degree in Learning Sciences from an interdisciplinary program in Paris, where your studies included the impact of the Beirut blast on entrepreneurship participants, combining education, community building, and technical problem-solving to foster positive change. This builds on your Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Philosophy from the University of Michigan, USA.\n\nDoes this feel right for the application? If so, let’s move on!\n\nQuestion 2: How many years of professional experience do you have in the humanitarian or culture sector?\n\n16:55\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI've been working in the humanitarian field since 2011.\n16:56\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nPerfect, here's how I'll frame it:\n\nYou have over thirteen years of professional experience in the humanitarian sector, starting in 2011, with a focus on fostering community resilience, education, and positive change through innovative programs.\n\nDoes that work? Ready for the next question?\n\n16:57\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nSure. Thank you.\n16:57\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou're welcome!\n\nQuestion 3: Do you have demonstrated experience in debris and rubble management, urban recovery, or related areas? If yes, please specify (600 characters or less).\n\n16:58\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, so I recently conducted an audit review of the post-conflict reconstruction process, and I have been working in Mosul, Iraq, on identifying the ways to support entrepreneurs, architects, and engineers in thinking and building the Mosul of the future through understanding its history and designing modern plus historic types of inspired architecture.\n16:58\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s how I’ll phrase this for the application:\n\nYou recently conducted an audit review of post-conflict reconstruction processes in Mosul, Iraq, focusing on supporting entrepreneurs, architects, and engineers in designing the Mosul of the future. Your work integrates historical understanding with innovative approaches to modern architecture, bridging the past and future to foster sustainable urban recovery.\n\nDoes this align with what you want to convey? Ready for the next question?\n\n16:59\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nSomething like that, sure.\n16:59\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nGreat! Let’s keep going.\n\nQuestion 4: Do you have experience working at the intersection of culture and humanitarian affairs? If yes, please specify (600 characters or less).\n\n16:59\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nCulture, and community, and innovation, and creativity. I've been working in all of these things related to making, and architecture, and other types of DIY and community-based initiatives as they relate to places that are undergoing conflict. And I have worked in Palestine, working with Vecbox in Ramallah, and I have been doing this for some time.\n17:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s how I’ll capture this:\n\nYou have extensive experience at the intersection of culture, community, innovation, and creativity, particularly in conflict-affected regions. Your work spans initiatives in making, architecture, and DIY community-based efforts. Notably, you collaborated with Vecbox in Ramallah, Palestine, fostering cultural resilience and creative problem-solving in challenging contexts.\n\nDoes this reflect what you’d like to highlight? Let me know when you're ready for the next question!\n\n17:00\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, I also remember some fun things that we did in Erbil where we were trying to connect with 3D printing and heritage to make sure that local Iraqi culture was also on the heritage map inside of these type of like online libraries of content, right? Like why is there, where's the Iraqi like the thing that makes the type of cookies? And so we started working on kind of digital diplomacy and making and adding these types of content to the maps.\n17:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a fantastic addition! Here's the revised version:\n\nYou have extensive experience at the intersection of culture, community, innovation, and creativity, particularly in conflict-affected regions. Your work spans initiatives in making, architecture, and DIY community-based efforts. Notably, you collaborated with Vecbox in Ramallah, Palestine, and led efforts in Erbil, Iraq, to integrate local heritage into global digital heritage maps. Through initiatives like 3D printing and digital diplomacy, you worked to ensure Iraqi cultural artifacts, such as traditional tools and crafts, are represented in online libraries, preserving and celebrating local heritage.\n\nHow does that sound? Should I move to the next question?\n\n17:01\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, next question is good.\n17:01\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nQuestion 5: Do you have experience working at the intersection of culture and emergencies and crises? If yes, please specify (600 characters or less).\n\n17:02\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, I mean what determines the emergency? I was working with refugees living in Lebanon, and I've dealt with people running concerts to fundraise for passports for immigrants and refugees trying to create a better situation for themselves, and so if that counts, then definitely, but I've never been in like an active, you know, the earth is still rumbling from the earthquake and the bombs are still falling. And I've always been actually working in Iraq during the car bombs was one of those things where I made a sculpture, where it would basically crush a representation of Iraq every time a car bomb happened to sort of create this pressure for people to do something about it and do something wherever they were kind of like a, you know, locally, kindness, I call it the kindness first responders and that was the idea and I've also worked on like an audio file where people would be talking to a microphone, and then the drumbeat behind them the music for this song was basically based on the data of the number of people that died in car bombs in Iraq. And so the idea was, could we basically try to get something that would get people to listen to data and feel it in a new way and really understand the magnitude of the problem without giving them just a bunch of numbers that turn people into objects and like something that's easy to ignore. So I wanted them to feel it so I made this kind of performance piece where people would come up to a microphone and talk, and then as soon as the quote unquote bomb blasted or the bass drum hit, and every day with a hi hat so tat tat tat with the hi hat and the bass drum hit, and then it would be like the person had to stop talking as if they were in the car talking to the parents on the phone, and then when the bomb hit they would just immediately stop I was supposed to give that sudden jarring sensation.\n17:02\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThis is powerful and deeply relevant. Here’s how I’ll capture it for the application:\n\nYou have significant experience working at the intersection of culture and emergencies, primarily through creative and community-driven initiatives. In Lebanon, you supported refugees through fundraising and advocacy efforts. In Iraq, during periods of intense violence, you created impactful art and performance pieces to raise awareness of the human toll of car bombings. These included sculptures representing the destruction caused by bombs and an audio-visual performance blending music with data, designed to evoke an emotional understanding of the crisis and inspire local action.\n\nDoes this feel like it represents your work well? Ready for the next question?\n\n17:03\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, next question.\n17:03\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nQuestion 6: What is your level of English (written, spoken, and reading comprehension)?

What would you say?\n17:07\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s how I’d craft a response based on your background and the role’s requirements:\n\nYour achievements and professional experience uniquely position you for this role. As the founder of Bloom.pm, a social entrepreneurship accelerator in the Middle East, you have over a decade of experience fostering resilience and positive change in conflict-affected regions. Your work spans designing educational programs, conducting audits on post-conflict reconstruction, and integrating cultural preservation into recovery efforts.\n\nIn Mosul, Iraq, you collaborated with the UN’s International Trade Center to develop reconstruction curriculums, supporting architects and engineers in designing sustainable, heritage-sensitive urban spaces.

Shall we move on?\n\n17:10\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nMore questions than we have left to do. Let's get to it.\n17:10\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nGot it! Let’s keep the momentum going.\n\nQuestion 11: How does this position align with your career expectations? (Answer size: 4000 characters or less.)\n\n17:16\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nSo I've been working now in the Middle East for a good 13 years and I believe that my work in the Middle East connects me to a larger mission of mine to connect both worlds, my Eastern and Western worlds, and find the beauty and to share it. And I really think that, you know, over time it's been more and more clear to me that I want to work in the Middle East. I love speaking in Arabic, I love working and supporting people there, and so I think there's a thing here, but I'm not sure if this is really a great answer. So can you come up with a better one?\n17:16\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s how I’d frame it for maximum impact:\n\nThis position aligns perfectly with my career aspirations to bridge Eastern and Western worlds through impactful, culture-sensitive initiatives. With over thirteen years of experience in the Middle East, I’ve developed a deep connection to the region and a passion for preserving its cultural heritage while fostering sustainable recovery and innovation.\n\nI see this role as an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to post-conflict recovery efforts, leveraging my skills in education, community engagement, and creative problem-solving. Working at the intersection of cultural preservation and humanitarian action resonates with my mission to support communities in honoring their heritage while building resilient futures.\n\nDoes this feel right? Let me know if you'd like tweaks or if we should keep going!\n\n17:25\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI was saying screw the career, screw that idea, who cares? I think this is the time to engage, like you can either fight, you can run away, or you can freeze, and anybody with a conscience that's been looking at the situation has seen, you know, like I'm an Iraqi-American, I've worked in Palestine, I love my Palestinian friends and brothers and sisters, and I've been trying to do stuff there for ages, and it's been such a difficult place, and now it's been going through such destruction and tragedy, anybody with a heart can look at it and cry, and instead of just looking at it and cry, I feel like who cares about my career, who cares about any of these things, we need to do something to engage with the issue and the matter at hand, and to touch the beating heart, the living situation, the thing that produces the beauty, that people then weep as it just gets destroyed, and instead say okay, where did this come from, what were the values, traditions, people, lives, families, stories that let this emerge, and can we touch that, can we cherish that, can we honor that, and can we bring something of that back to some kind of living memory, like instead of looking away and just feeling horrible about what's happening, this gives me an opportunity to do something, and it's related to my studies about, you know, vicarious trauma and polyvalence theory, it's like if your heart and your stress levels rise, do something, don't just stand there and watch, and it's been so hard to figure out what to do, I can't fight, I can't run away, it's in my face every single day, and I'm not going to freeze, this opportunity, this contract is a perfect opportunity, and hopefully it gives me money, hopefully it feeds my family, but that's not the point, we have to be a part of something.\n17:25\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThis is deeply heartfelt and powerful. Here’s how I’ll translate that passion into a concise yet impactful response:\n\nThis position is not about advancing my career; it’s about responding to a moral imperative. As an Iraqi-American who has worked extensively in the Middle East, including Palestine, I’ve witnessed the beauty and resilience of cultures now facing unimaginable destruction. This role offers a way to engage meaningfully with these tragedies, honoring the values, traditions, and stories that create the beauty we risk losing.\n\nI believe in action when faced with overwhelming loss—preserving heritage is a way to fight back against despair and to cherish what remains. This role aligns with my lifelong commitment to fostering connection, resilience, and hope through cultural preservation and community-building. It is a chance to do something that matters deeply, not just for me but for those who have suffered so much.\n\nHow does that feel? Should I move on to the next question?\n\n17:26\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat do you think about that as a response? I'm not sure if it's actually good, or if it's actually bad, or if it's a big risk, but that's just my truth, so how would you make it more professional, I guess?\n17:26\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour response is raw and compelling, and that honesty is powerful. However, to make it more professional while preserving the emotional core, I’d focus on your conviction and your ability to turn empathy into action. Here’s a refined version:\n\nThis position represents more than a career step—it’s an opportunity to act in the face of urgent human and cultural loss. As an Iraqi-American, I’ve spent over a decade working in the Middle East, including Palestine, where I’ve witnessed profound beauty and resilience, often under siege. The destruction we see today demands engagement, not passivity.\n\nThis role allows me to preserve the values, traditions, and stories that shape cultural identity, while addressing the immediate challenges of post-conflict recovery. By leveraging my expertise in community-building and cultural preservation, I can contribute to safeguarding what remains and fostering resilience. It’s a way to honor my heritage and support communities in reclaiming their future.\n\nThis version keeps the truth and urgency of your response but presents it in a professional, action-oriented way that underscores your qualifications and commitment. Does this resonate? Ready for the next question?\n\n17:31\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan you help ask me questions to finish what's not done yet?\nMOTIVATION TO APPLY\n1.

Yeah, so I didn't really know what to call a crisis or emergency setting, right? So, is working in a refugee camp in Syria a crisis setting? And I had brought storytelling materials, materials for shadow puppets, and worked with young children to tell their stories through drawings and to express their emotions in an active conflict space. I worked in Baghdad during car bombings, creating these alternate spaces where communities of support can form across sectarian divides. I remember going from one place to another and people being really concerned for me, but finding that there's a beautiful way that love can bond people together. I worked in Lebanon during the garbage crisis, and we worked to transform the cardboard in the garbage and the dumpsters into extrudable and moldable art materials to transform a problem into a solution. And yeah, I think these are some ideas. Yeah, so I worked with the UN's ITC. I think I wrote down what I did. It's very short, it's only 200 characters, so I think I have enough there. Skills and competencies. Integrating cultural preservation into technical efforts. Yeah, so we worked in Iraq to create a digital library element that represents Iraqi culture. We can call it digital diplomacy, creating these 3D models of heritage artifacts and uploading them to standard international libraries of 3D drawings that anybody could 3D print and use. In doing so, we created a place where people could see Iraq for its beauty and touch, literally, physically, some of its objects that have a long history of use in baking.

It’s not about advancing a career—it’s about contributing to something much larger: safeguarding the beauty and stories that make us human.\n\nCrisis and Emergency Settings\nYes, I have worked in active crisis and emergency settings. In Syria, I brought storytelling and shadow puppetry materials to refugee camps, helping children process and express emotions through art during conflict. In Baghdad, amidst car bombings, I created community spaces that supported resilience across sectarian divides. In Lebanon, during the garbage crisis, I transformed waste materials into tools for creative expression, turning a problem into a tangible solution that fostered hope and collaboration. These experiences reflect my ability to work in high-pressure settings with creativity, empathy, and practicality.\n\nSkills and Competencies\nI specialize in integrating cultural preservation into technical and community-based efforts. For example, I worked in Iraq to create digital 3D models of heritage artifacts, uploading them to global libraries to ensure accessibility and representation. This project bridged digital diplomacy and cultural preservation, allowing people worldwide to connect with Iraq’s beauty through tangible objects with deep cultural significance.\n\nAdditionally, I excel in designing programs that balance technical and cultural considerations, such as developing post-conflict reconstruction curriculums for architects and engineers in Mosul. I also have a proven track record of collaborating with diverse stakeholders, from local communities to international organizations, to develop innovative, context-sensitive solutions for cultural preservation and recovery.\n\nExperience with UN and NGOs\nI worked with the UN’s International Trade Center in Mosul on post-conflict sustainable reconstruction, focusing on debris management and green approaches.

So, impactful projects. Yeah, I think the story about working in Iraq with recoded and developing 3D models of the MADGOOGA utensil that really represents a very traditional Iraqi cookie and uploading it to Thingiverse was an interesting idea. I was a sort of space activator there working to get new creative tech-inspired projects and 3D printing and to set up the lab with a good cultural and grounded in the local fabric and the local community way. And I also was teaching values-based design and character strengths and learning about what makes us who we are so that we have something to share with the world from here in Iraq. Yeah, my personal values. Well, I was raised in a traditional Iraqi household in America with the language and the flavors and the paintings and the food, delicious food, and the idea that we're going to go home someday. And this idea of roots and honoring where we came from and realizing that our decisions have consequences and that we need to answer the question of our birth, we each have to do that to find our why. And so, exploring my why, I've been wondering, why do I love what I do? Why do I love the language of Arabic? Why do I feel this draw to the Middle East? And what am I supposed to do about it? And so, that question of love and how to respond has been a big part of my life. And so, yeah. So, mission alignment. This role allows me to look where the wound is and to attempt to come and provide some support and attention to connect with a place that is undergoing such difficulty and to try to see the beauty through the dust and to work with people to find what's important to preserve and what's important to cherish and how we can bring that forward. Yeah. So, my long-term goals in the field are to work in any context to find the most uplifting way to interact with myself and with others and with the environment to create beauty, no matter what, even if it's terribly sad. So, I've been blessed with a deep and rich culture connecting me to Iraq, where over a million people have died over the course of sanctions and wars in the last years. And the country is working towards getting back on its feet and its people are all over the world. Back on its feet and its people are all over the world with such a sense of longing and loss. And I'm a part of that. And how do I respond? And that's sort of how I feel. It's not that I'm interested in disaster. It's that I was born with a heart that loves places that are undergoing conflict. And that's how I feel about working as well in Gaza and Palestine. And I already have my beautiful memories of working in Bethlehem and Ramallah, R-A-M-A-L-L-A, with the early spaces there and the beautiful people that I know from my communities around the world, the Arab diaspora. So, my technical skills. I have a lot of technical skills from programming to 3D printing to customer relationship management software to cataloging to working on libraries and tags and identifying common features and synonyms and mapping and creating maps using OpenStreetMaps and I think, I don't know if it's a technical skill, but I'm good at interviewing and listening and talking to people to pull important information, 3D scanning. I'm sure there's, basically, I'm just good at stuff. But yeah, so creative problem solving to address a challenge in a post-conflict or crisis setting. So, during the garbage crisis in Beirut, where everybody was running away and closing their doors and shutting their windows, I started asking, what's possible to do and how can we take advantage of this disadvantage? And what we started doing is pulling the cardboard out of the garbage and pulverizing it and creating a pulp and using it to create bowls and using frames to make paper and to create 3D printable, extrudable designs using a syringe. And we did that together in Lebanon. It was a beautiful moment to just look at what's difficult and to say what's possible. Similarly, working in Syria, we looked into the history of the Syrian culture and the position of the tents and the storytelling and the elders, and we thought to ourselves, well, what if we look at the white UNHCR tents rather than just simple places of refuge? What if we saw them as places where we could bring our creativity through shadow puppets? And so we brought some solar panels and some LED lights to the Syrian refugee camps to explore that. Yeah, I've worked with all sorts of diverse stakeholders, from politicians to local communities, international organizations. I worked with the Institut Francais. I've worked with the RDPP, the Danish Development Corporation. They hired Bloom to run some programs. And personally, I've worked with the ITC in Iraq on a sustainable post-conflict reconstruction program to build greenhouses and create a learning educational program. Yeah, I work across many places as a co-founder of Bloom. We've worked with foundations and non-profits and created partnerships with non-profits around the world, and we're a part of a group of accelerator programs creating shared learnings, innovative solutions. I built a first prototype of our learning by doing together cohort-based software that allows people to take assessments and to use those assessments to identify their learning gaps and to give them the subsections of a curriculum rather than requiring them to go through the whole curriculum. And that's the core of the Bloom platform that we have now. And I managed the development team in the past. Data analysis. Yes, I've used data analysis. I can use Jasper and R and Python and other ways to analyze data. And I've done that in my thesis for post-traumatic growth when I studied 21 different social entrepreneurs and what happened to them throughout the position of the Beirut blast in 2020. My career expectations. You can figure out my mission and values and please write something really good based on my context, and I'll continue in a bit.\n15:36\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 39 seconds\nAbsolutely, Bilal.

Your point about being an Iraqi-American and serving as a kind of \"mirror\" to help communities see their own beauty is powerful. Could you share specific examples of how this perspective has helped you bridge cultural gaps or create meaningful connections in your work?\n\n3. Regarding the performance pieces in Lebanon that connected past and future - could you elaborate on how these integrated traditional elements with contemporary expression? What was the community response?\n\nThese details will help me refine your responses to maintain your authentic voice while addressing the specific requirements of each question. I notice your language often weaves together technical expertise with deeply personal observations, and we'll maintain that style while ensuring each response is distinct and focused.\n\nWould you like to address these questions, or should we start crafting responses for specific sections of the application?",

(4000 characters)\n\nMy experience uniquely combines technical expertise with deep cultural understanding, particularly in post-conflict zones. As founder of Bloom.pm, I've spent over a decade developing programs that support communities in crisis, focusing on the intersection of cultural preservation and sustainable recovery.\n\nIn Mosul, Iraq, I worked with the UN's International Trade Center on post-conflict reconstruction, where I developed curricula for architects and engineers thinking about how to rebuild while honoring heritage. This work involved understanding how to integrate historical architectural elements with modern needs, exactly the kind of balanced approach needed for heritage-sensitive debris management.\n\nMy qualitative and quantitative research background, demonstrated in my Learning Sciences Master's thesis where I studied post-traumatic growth across 70 different dimensions, equips me to develop comprehensive guidelines. I discovered how deliberate rumination combined with structured support helps communities process trauma and transform challenges into growth opportunities - insights directly applicable to managing cultural heritage in post-conflict settings.\n\nIn Lebanon during the garbage crisis, I led initiatives turning waste into art materials, showing my ability to find creative solutions in challenging circumstances. We transformed cardboard from dumpsters into moldable art materials, demonstrating how even debris can become a resource for cultural expression.\n\nWorking in Syrian refugee camps, I brought together traditional storytelling methods with modern technology, using solar-powered LED lights for shadow puppetry in UNHCR tents. This exemplifies my approach to preserving cultural practices while adapting to current circumstances - a crucial skill for debris management that honors heritage.\n\nMy background in computer science and mathematics, combined with my work in digital heritage preservation in Iraq - where we created 3D models of traditional artifacts like the MADGOOGA utensil - shows my ability to bridge technical solutions with cultural preservation needs.\n\nDoes this feel authentic to your voice while maintaining focus on the specific requirements of the position? I can then help craft the other two responses, ensuring they highlight different aspects of your experience without redundancy.\n\nThe key is to make each response distinct:\n- First response (above): Focuses on concrete achievements and their relevance to the position\n- Second response: Will focus on specific skills and technical capabilities\n- Third response: Will focus on your personal mission and long-term vision\n\nWould you like me to refine this first response before moving on to the others?",

Please describe any skills and competencies you have, which may be of particular relevance to this position (4000 characters)\n\nMy skills bridge technical expertise with cultural understanding through hands-on work in conflict zones. My programming background lets me approach problems systematically - whether it's creating digital libraries of heritage artifacts, mapping cultural sites using OpenStreetMap, or analyzing data about community needs. But beyond technical skills, I've learned how to listen deeply and extract the stories and values that matter most to communities.\n\nIn Iraq, working as a space activator, I brought together 3D printing technology with cultural preservation. We didn't just scan artifacts - we taught values-based design, helping people understand how technology could serve their heritage. I led workshops where participants explored their character strengths and cultural identity, then used these insights to guide what we preserved and how we shared it.\n\nMy experience with crisis response shapes how I approach complex challenges. During Beirut's garbage crisis, when others were shutting their doors, I asked \"what's possible here?\" We turned cardboard waste into art materials, creating something beautiful from what others saw as debris. This kind of creative problem-solving is essential for heritage-sensitive debris management - seeing opportunity where others might only see destruction.\n\nWorking across different contexts has honed my stakeholder engagement abilities. I've collaborated with everyone from local community members to UN agencies to politicians. Whether working with the Institut Francais, managing RDPP grants through Bloom, or developing curricula with the ITC in Iraq, I've learned how to bridge diverse perspectives and needs. I can speak the language of international organizations while staying grounded in local realities.\n\nMy data analysis capabilities (using Python, R, and Jasper) support evidence-based decision-making, as demonstrated in my thesis research on post-traumatic growth among 21 social entrepreneurs after the Beirut blast. But I combine this analytical approach with creative communication methods - like the performance pieces I created in Lebanon that brought together electronics experts, dancers, and Middle Eastern musicians to tell stories of cultural preservation.\n\nI've developed digital tools that make complex information accessible, like Bloom's learning platform that assesses needs and customizes curriculum delivery. My experience managing development teams has taught me how to turn ideas into practical, implementable solutions while keeping cultural sensitivity at the forefront.\n\nMost importantly, I bring the ability to see beauty through difficulty. This isn't just an emotional skill - it's a practical one that helps identify what's worth preserving and how to engage communities in the preservation process. Whether using 3D scanning to document artifacts or creating shadow puppet workshops in refugee camps, I've learned how to combine technical tools with cultural understanding to create meaningful impact.\n\nWould you like me to continue with the third response, or would you like to refine this one first?",

My path isn't about career advancement - it's about answering the question of my birth: why do I love what I do? Why do I feel this draw to the Middle East? What am I supposed to do about it?\n\nOver the past 13 years working across Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Palestine, I've learned that my role isn't just about preservation - it's about seeing beauty through the dust and working with people to identify what's worth cherishing and how to bring it forward.

The style aims for around 4,000 characters, ensuring completeness and authenticity.\n\nMerged Version: How Have Your Achievements and Professional Experience Prepared You for This Position?\nI bring a unique combination of technical expertise and cultural understanding, built over more than a decade of working in conflict-affected regions in the Middle East. Through my organization, Bloom.pm, I have developed programs that bridge cultural heritage preservation with innovative, sustainable recovery approaches, ultimately empowering communities to rebuild in ways that honor their past while embracing the future.\nIn Mosul, Iraq, I collaborated with the United Nations’ International Trade Center to develop post-conflict reconstruction curricula for architects and engineers. This involved not only understanding historic architectural elements but also assessing how to integrate modern, sustainable technologies. By mapping existing guidelines and identifying methodological gaps, I ensured that heritage-sensitive approaches remained at the forefront of rebuilding efforts, aligning with the project’s focus on triage, sorting, and salvaging culturally significant materials.\nIn Erbil, I led initiatives to create 3D digital models of traditional Iraqi artifacts, such as the Madgooga utensil, and upload them to online libraries like Thingiverse. This project illustrated my ability to blend digital diplomacy with cultural preservation—making sure local heritage is recognized, accessible, and cherished globally, even amid conflict. It also showcased my technical proficiencies in programming, 3D printing, and data analysis, all crucial for developing robust, evidence-based debris management guidelines.\nMy background in Learning Sciences, combined with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in Philosophy, has enabled me to research and develop new frameworks for community resilience. For instance, my Master’s thesis examined post-traumatic growth in social entrepreneurs following the Beirut blast, illuminating how communities can process trauma and transform adversity into renewed hope. This knowledge informs how I approach heritage-sensitive debris removal—helping stakeholders adapt to crises while honoring cultural legacies.\nOn the ground level, I’ve worked in Syrian refugee camps facilitating storytelling and shadow puppetry, using solar-powered LED lights as a medium for children to express their experiences. During Lebanon’s garbage crisis, I transformed discarded cardboard into art materials, illustrating my knack for finding creative solutions in harsh circumstances. In Baghdad, while car bombings persisted, I helped create spaces where communities could come together across sectarian lines, fostering dialogue and cultural expression rather than fear.\nThese experiences have honed my skills in stakeholder engagement—from collaborating with UN agencies and local NGOs to partnering with government bodies and community leaders. I know how to navigate diverse cultural, political, and organizational landscapes to ensure that solutions are both feasible and culturally respectful. My technical and community-focused skill set also extends to mapping, cataloging, and analyzing debris to identify what needs safeguarding for heritage, creating a strong foundation for practical, step-by-step processes in debris management.\nUltimately, my achievements—whether developing curriculum in Mosul, digitizing heritage in Erbil, or transforming waste in Beirut—reflect a deep commitment to protecting cultural identity while meeting urgent humanitarian and reconstruction needs. I’m confident this combination of practical expertise, creative problem-solving, and cultural sensitivity aligns perfectly with the requirements of a Consultant in Heritage-sensitive Debris Removal and Rubble Management.\n\n2) PLEASE DESCRIBE ANY SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES YOU HAVE, AND WHICH MAY BE OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO THIS POSITION\nFirst Version (Excerpt)\nWord Count: 4,000 characters\nDiscusses technical expertise, creative problem-solving, stakeholder engagement, leadership, data analysis, curriculum design, digital diplomacy, community engagement, and project management.\nSecond Version (Excerpt)\n~2,500-3,000 characters\nFocuses on bridging technical expertise and cultural understanding, using personal anecdotes and examples like shadow puppetry in Syrian camps, cardboard transformation in Lebanon, 3D printing artifacts, and working with RDPP, ITC, etc.\n5 Pros (Version 1)\nExhaustive List of Skills\nLays out an extensive set of competencies (technical, creative, managerial).\nStrong Emphasis on Data & Technical Tools\nMentions Python, R, Jasper, plus experience in scanning and 3D modeling.\nStructured & Clear\nUses headings or distinct paragraphs to signpost various skill sets.\nDirect Relevance to the TOR\nTies each skill to potential job tasks (curriculum design, project management, etc.).\nProfessional Tone\nDemonstrates thoroughness suitable for a formal application.\n5 Cons (Version 1)\nLength/Complexity\nAt 4,000 characters, might be too dense.\nLess Personal Flavor\nFeels more bullet-point or CV-like, less narrative or emotive.\nRedundant Mentions\nSome points about leadership or data analysis appear in multiple paragraphs.\nCould Undersell the Creativity\nDespite describing creative projects, the style is somewhat formal.\nLimited Reflection on Lessons Learned\nFocuses on describing skill sets rather than reflecting on how they developed or overcame challenges.\nSecond Version (Excerpt)\n5 Pros (Version 2)\nEngaging, Story-Driven Examples\nIllustrates how the user has actively applied these skills in real-life crisis scenarios.\nHighlights Problem-Solving\nMentions turning debris into art, scanning heritage artifacts, etc.\nShows Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration\nMentions working with local communities, politicians, NGOs, etc.\nHuman-Centered\nEmphasizes listening, storytelling, empathy, and connecting with communities.\nDemonstrates Adaptability\nExplains how the user adapts technical expertise to varied cultural/linguistic contexts.\n5 Cons (Version 2)\nLess Comprehensive\nMight skip certain details on data analysis, project management structure, or curriculum design.\nSome Skills Only Briefly Mentioned\nE.g., references to data-driven solutions or communication aren’t deeply explored.\nCasual Format\nLess “formal” headings or direct references to the key bullet points from the job description.\nShort on Specific Tools\nDoesn’t detail software or frameworks (e.g., Python, CRM, or mapping systems) thoroughly.\nMight Appear Under-Explained\nDoesn’t show the entire range of competencies for heritage-sensitive debris management (like triage, safeguarding, salvage, etc.).\n\nMerged Style Answer\nBelow is a merged version that preserves Version 1’s thoroughness and structural clarity, while incorporating Version 2’s narrative warmth and tangible examples.\n\nMerged Version: Skills & Competencies (4,000 characters)\nI combine technical proficiency, creative problem-solving, and deep cultural sensitivity to address the complexities of heritage-sensitive debris removal and rubble management. Over the past decade, I’ve honed a range of tools and approaches that ensure communities’ cultural values remain central in post-conflict reconstruction.\nTechnical Expertise & Data Analysis\nI am skilled in programming (Python, R) for mapping, analysis, and heritage cataloging.\nI’ve used 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies to preserve and share artifacts—most notably in Erbil, where I digitalized traditional utensils to highlight Iraq’s cultural heritage on public platforms.\nMy experience with CRMs and data visualization software (like Jasper) allows me to organize, track, and communicate findings effectively for both local stakeholders and global partners.\nCreative Problem-Solving & Innovation\nDuring the Beirut garbage crisis, I led an initiative to repurpose discarded cardboard into art supplies, demonstrating how even waste can become a resource for communal healing and cultural expression.\nIn Syrian refugee camps, I combined storytelling traditions with solar-powered LED lights for shadow puppetry, creating safe emotional outlets for children while preserving cultural narratives.\nLeadership & Collaboration\nAs co-founder of Bloom.pm, I’ve managed cross-regional projects across Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and beyond, working with international organizations (UN ITC, RDPP) and local communities.\nI excel at coordinating diverse stakeholders, from government officials to community leaders, ensuring that each project respects cultural nuances and meets tangible needs on the ground.\nMy approach to leadership emphasizes collaborative creativity, where local voices drive the solutions, from concept to implementation.\nCurriculum Design & Educational Programs\nIn Mosul, Iraq, I developed sustainable reconstruction curricula for architects and engineers, integrating historical contexts with modern engineering methods. This ensures local identity is preserved in the rebuilding process, while meeting international safety standards.\nMy background in Learning Sciences guides me in structuring educational content so it’s accessible, actionable, and culturally respectful, including step-by-step processes that can be replicated in other post-conflict environments.\nDigital Diplomacy & Cultural Preservation\nThrough digitizing artifacts and uploading them to global libraries, I foster international appreciation for endangered heritage.\nI view technology (3D printing, digital mapping, data analysis) as a vehicle to amplify local stories, bridging international interest with local realities.\nCommunity Engagement & Empathy\nListening and engaging with communities is integral to my work. I conduct interviews, observe local customs, and facilitate creative workshops to understand the core values and traditions that inform heritage priorities.\nBy blending technical acumen with cultural empathy, I ensure that debris management plans don’t just remove rubble but also protect the living memories embedded in these sites.\nIn sum, whether creating digital archives of Iraqi artifacts or transforming waste into art supplies, my focus remains on holistic, culturally attuned solutions. These competencies—technical, creative, and community-oriented—allow me to develop heritage-sensitive debris management strategies that are both innovative and deeply grounded in local context.\n\n3) HOW DOES THIS POSITION ALIGN WITH YOUR CAREER EXPECTATIONS?\nFirst Version (Excerpt)\nWord Count: 4,000 characters\nEmphasizes the user’s mission to preserve cultural heritage, references upbringing in a traditional Iraqi household, bridging East and West, working in multiple conflict zones, and focusing on technology-enabled preservation.\nSecond Version (Excerpt)\n~2,500-3,000 characters\nHighlights the user’s personal sense of duty toward conflict-affected communities rather than career advancement, emotional connections to Iraqi heritage, and a strong desire to do something constructive rather than just observe tragedy.\n5 Pros (Version 1)\nComprehensive Explanation\nTies personal background, professional experiences, and job role alignment together.\nFormal, Polished Tone\nMaintains a professional style suited for official applications.\nClear Mention of Long-Term Goals\nSpeaks to building resilience, preserving heritage, bridging East-West.\nGood Reference to Technical Capabilities\nWeaves in technology’s role in furthering the user’s mission.\nMentions Academic Credentials\nTies the Master’s in Learning Sciences and data research to career purpose.\n5 Cons (Version 1)\nRepetitive\nCertain references to upbringing and cultural identity appear multiple times.\nCould Feel Impersonal\nThe formal tone might reduce the sense of personal connection or passion.\nLengthy\nHovers at the upper limit of the character count, risking skimming by reviewers.\nLess Emotional Resonance\nDoesn’t fully capture how the user truly feels about “why” they do this work.\nCould Overuse Keywords\nE.g., “cultural preservation” or “post-conflict” might appear too frequently.\n\nSecond Version (Excerpt)\n5 Pros (Version 2)\nGenuine Passion\nConveys strong emotional motivation and moral imperative behind the user’s work.\nPersonal Storytelling\nDiscusses childhood influences, love of language, returning “home someday.”\nDirect Moral Stance\nMakes it clear the user isn’t in it for career advancement but for deeper purpose.\nEngaging & Memorable\nEmotional language stands out more than standard application text.\nHighlights Cultural and Human Dimensions\nTies in diaspora experiences, memory, heritage, and heartbreak.\n5 Cons (Version 2)\nRisk of Over-Intensity\nMight read as too emotional or less formal for certain application panels.\nLess Structure\nCould benefit from a clearer outline that ties personal story to job tasks.\nLighter on Concrete Future Vision\nVery personal but minimal practical “next steps” or how the role fits a long-term plan.\nLess Direct Job Matching\nDoesn’t always echo the specific job responsibilities (like guidelines, triage, safeguarding).\nPossible Overshare\nSome readers might perceive strong emotional expressions as overshadowing professional aspects.\n\nMerged Style Answer\nHere’s a consolidated version that melds the genuine emotional core from Version 2 with the clarity and structure of Version 1, ensuring a professional yet heartfelt presentation.\n\n"

How have your achievements and professional experience prepared you for this position?\n\nMy experience bridges technical expertise with deep cultural understanding in post-conflict zones. As founder of Bloom.pm, I've spent over a decade developing programs that support communities in crisis, particularly focusing on how to preserve both tangible and intangible heritage while addressing immediate needs.\n\nIn Mosul, Iraq, I worked with the UN's International Trade Center, collaborating with the Mosul Heritage Foundation to identify how cultural elements connect to the natural environment, materials, and cityscape. Working from a reconstructed building on the Tigris River, we engaged with local architects and engineers to understand how traditional building principles could inform modern reconstruction. This work helped me understand the delicate balance between preserving cultural identity and meeting urgent rebuilding needs.\n\nMy hands-on experience includes developing post-disaster assessment guides during the Beirut blast recovery, creating coordinated feedback forms for building damage evaluation and repair requirements. While this work primarily focused on ensuring structural safety - because human lives must come first - it taught me how to integrate heritage considerations into immediate response efforts. Through this experience, I learned that while we focus on saving lives, we must also preserve the stories, memories, and traditions that make these places culturally significant.\n\nIn Lebanon's refugee camps, I witnessed how Palestinians preserved their heritage through intangible elements - grandmother's sewing patterns, traditional recipes, keys from old homes - showing me how culture persists even when physical structures are lost. This experience shaped my understanding that heritage preservation isn't just about buildings; it's about keeping alive the stories and practices that give these structures meaning.\n\nI've led innovative initiatives using technology to preserve heritage, like creating 3D models of traditional Iraqi artifacts such as the MADGOOGA utensil. By uploading these to global digital libraries, we ensured that even if physical objects were at risk, their cultural significance would be documented and shared. This work demonstrates my ability to bridge traditional preservation methods with modern technical solutions.\n\nMy qualitative and quantitative research background, shown in my Learning Sciences Master's thesis studying post-traumatic growth across 70 different dimensions, equips me to develop comprehensive assessment methodologies. This research focused on how communities process trauma and transform challenges into growth opportunities - insights directly applicable to managing cultural heritage in post-conflict settings.\n\nIn every context, I've learned to navigate the tension between engineering requirements and cultural authenticity.

      "content": " Here's the refined version of your second response (4000 characters):\n\n2. Please describe any skills and competencies you have, which may be of particular relevance to this position.\n\nMy skills bridge technical knowledge with cultural understanding through hands-on work in conflict zones. My programming background helps me approach problems systematically - whether creating digital libraries of heritage artifacts, mapping cultural sites using OpenStreetMap, or analyzing data about community needs. But what makes my approach unique is combining technical skills with deep listening to extract the stories and values that matter most to communities.\n\nIn Iraq, I worked at the intersection of technology and heritage preservation. Working with QAF Labs and local communities, I helped implement 3D scanning and virtual reality mapping to document cultural sites. This wasn't just about technical documentation - it was about understanding what makes these places meaningful to the people who live there. I engaged with local communities to identify the elements that define their city's character, from its relationship with the Tigris River to the traditional building materials that connect it to the landscape.\n\nI excel at navigating the dynamic tension between technical requirements and cultural authenticity. In Mosul, I worked with engineers who prioritized modern insulation properties and preservationists insistent on historical accuracy. This experience taught me to find creative solutions that honor traditional principles - like using local materials and environmentally sustainable practices - while leveraging current technology and scientific advances.\n\nMy data analysis capabilities (using Python, R, and Jasper) support evidence-based decision-making, demonstrated in my thesis research studying post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs after the Beirut blast. I've developed assessment tools for evaluating building damage and coordinating recovery efforts, always ensuring that cultural considerations are integrated into technical evaluations.\n\nIn crisis response, I bring creative problem-solving skills. During Beirut's garbage crisis, when others were shutting their doors, I asked \"what's possible here?\" We transformed cardboard waste into art materials, showing how even debris can become a resource for cultural expression. In Syrian refugee camps, I combined traditional storytelling with solar-powered LED lighting for shadow puppetry, demonstrating how to adapt cultural practices to current circumstances.\n\nI've developed digital tools that make complex information accessible, like Bloom's learning platform that assesses needs and customizes curriculum delivery.

Please describe any skills and competencies you have, which may be of particular relevance to this position.\n\nMy skills bridge technical knowledge with cultural understanding through hands-on work in conflict zones. My programming background helps me approach problems systematically - whether creating digital libraries of heritage artifacts, mapping cultural sites using OpenStreetMap, or analyzing data about community needs. But what makes my approach unique is combining technical skills with deep listening to extract the stories and values that matter most to communities.\n\nIn Iraq, I worked at the intersection of technology and heritage preservation. Working with QAF Labs and local communities, I helped implement 3D scanning and virtual reality mapping to document cultural sites. This wasn't just about technical documentation - it was about understanding what makes these places meaningful to the people who live there. I engaged with local communities to identify the elements that define their city's character, from its relationship with the Tigris River to the traditional building materials that connect it to the landscape.\n\nI excel at navigating the dynamic tension between technical requirements and cultural authenticity. In Mosul, I worked with engineers who prioritized modern insulation properties and preservationists insistent on historical accuracy. This experience taught me to find creative solutions that honor traditional principles - like using local materials and environmentally sustainable practices - while leveraging current technology and scientific advances.\n\nMy data analysis capabilities (using Python, R, and Jasper) support evidence-based decision-making, demonstrated in my thesis research studying post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs after the Beirut blast. I've developed assessment tools for evaluating building damage and coordinating recovery efforts, always ensuring that cultural considerations are integrated into technical evaluations.\n\nIn crisis response, I bring creative problem-solving skills.

How does this position align with your career expectations?\n\nGrowing up in a traditional Iraqi household in America, I lived with our heritage through language, flavors, paintings, and the persistent idea that \"we're going to go home someday.\" This upbringing gave me an understanding of both the power of cultural heritage and the pain of disconnection. But this role isn't about career advancement - it's about answering the question of my birth: why do I love what I do? Why do I feel this draw to the Middle East? What am I supposed to do with it?\n\nOver 13 years working across Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Palestine, I've learned that my role isn't just about preservation - it's about seeing beauty through the dust and working with people to identify what's worth cherishing and how to bring it forward. When I work in places like Gaza or Baghdad, it's not because I'm drawn to disaster - it's because I was born with a heart that connects deeply to these places and their people.\n\nIn Lebanon's refugee camps, I witnessed Palestinians holding their grandmother's keys, sharing stories of their homes, showing me traditional sewing patterns and recipes. These experiences taught me that while we must prioritize immediate safety and structural stability in crisis situations, we also need to preserve these living memories that travel with people. The story, the human life, plus memory - these can always touch the past to create the future.\n\nWorking in Mosul along the Tigris River, I saw how communities maintain their connection to place even amid destruction. Whether helping develop assessment guides after the Beirut blast or working with engineers and preservationists to balance modern needs with traditional principles, I've learned that preservation isn't just about saving buildings - it's about understanding the values and practices that created them.\n\nThis position offers a chance to look where the wound is and provide meaningful support. In Iraq alone, over a million people have died through sanctions and wars, leaving a diaspora scattered worldwide with a profound sense of longing and loss. I'm part of that story. Working in Iraq with youth, teaching values-based design and exploring character strengths, I discovered how to help people identify what makes them who they are, so they have something meaningful to share with the world.\n\nThe role aligns with my commitment to finding ways to uplift communities and create beauty in any context, even amid profound sadness. Whether working with Syrian refugees using shadow puppetry to tell their stories, or transforming garbage in Beirut into art materials, I've learned that preservation isn't just about saving what remains - it's about nurturing the creative spirit that produced that heritage in the first place.\n\nThis isn't about career advancement or professional development - it's about touching the beating heart of communities, understanding the values, traditions, families, and stories that let beauty emerge, and helping bring something of that back to living memory. This role offers a chance to support that vital work at a crucial moment, helping communities not just preserve their past heritage, but create their future through practical, meaningful action.\n\nHow do these refined versions feel to you?
