You've been circling the same mental cul-de-sacs for years, and it's time to break out of the loop. You are brimming with insight, ideas, and potential, but you're paralyzed by overthinking and perfectionism. Do you even realize how much life you're wasting doubting yourself? Enough with the hand-wringing and endless theorizing!\n\nYou have a child now, a family depending on you. That matters. Stop spinning your wheels with every 'could be' and 'what if'—PICK SOMETHING and COMMIT! The world doesn’t need another philosopher drowning in drafts and half-finished projects. It needs the full force of Bilal Ghalib unleashed! The one who creates, not the one who hesitates.\n\nMoney? Yes, you need it. Stop treating it like a dirty word. Use your brain, skills, and connections to create something people value. Sell your expertise. You’ve been in workshops, innovation, and entrepreneurship for YEARS. Package it. Put a price tag on it. Start pitching!\n\nFocus? You’ve got so many interests, but guess what? You’re running from finishing ANYTHING because it scares you to think it might not be perfect. Perfection isn’t the goal—progress is. Narrow your scope. Write the damn book, launch the project, or build the consultancy.\n\nIdentity? You’re not irrelevant or outdated. You’re just hiding behind your own damn self-doubt. Lean into your story, your experiences, and your failures. They make you real, and people will connect with that if you let them.\n\nPositivity? You keep saying you want to stay positive, but you let your mindset sabotage you at every turn. Enough! Change happens when you DO, not just when you think about doing. Your spiritual master would tell you to trust, to act in the now. So DO IT.\n\nAnd Bilal, for the love of everything you’ve built and dreamed, stop talking about 'feeling stuck' like it's some eternal curse. You’re not stuck; you’re SCARED. Fear is normal. Let it fuel you instead of freeze you. Be scared and act anyway.\n\nYou’re turning 40. Do you want to look back and see a sea of could-haves and almosts? Or do you want to look at your kid, your wife, your friends, and say, 'I showed up. I tried. I built something with love and purpose'?\n\nYOU KNOW what you need to do. Now, DO IT. Not tomorrow. Not after you plan it to death. NOW!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOk, what then should I do that is a \"no duh\" except I just can't do it. \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThe \"no duh\" things—the painfully obvious stuff you already know you should do but just can’t seem to—is where the rubber meets the road. Let me break it down into concrete, bite-sized actions that tackle the paralysis and actually get you moving.\n\n1. Pick ONE Focus\nWhat you KNOW: You’re scattered because you want to do everything.\nWhat to DO: Choose one thing for the next 3 months. Whether it’s the children’s book, building a consultancy, or monetizing your workshops—just PICK.\nHow to Start: Write down your top 3 options and flip a coin if you have to. Commit to just ONE, knowing you can revisit the others later.\n2. Set a Microgoal\nWhat you KNOW: Big dreams overwhelm you, and then you freeze.\nWhat to DO: Make it laughably easy.\nExample:\nWant to write? Commit to 10 minutes a day of voice dictation.\nWant to build a consulting pitch? Write just the introduction this week.\nHow to Start: Set a timer for 15 minutes. Do one thing and stop.\n3. Create an \"Accountability Buddy\"\nWhat you KNOW: You work better when someone is expecting results.\nWhat to DO: Text one trusted friend or colleague and say,\n“Hey, I need help staying on track. Can I send you my goals each week and check in every Friday?”\nHow to Start: Commit to telling them one thing you’ll do this week. Then follow up.\n4. Earn Before You Overthink\nWhat you KNOW: You obsess over perfection before putting anything out there.\nWhat to DO: Sell imperfectly.\nTest your children's book idea by narrating it on YouTube or recording it as an audio story.\nPitch a stripped-down version of your consultancy to 3 people this week.\nHow to Start: Send an email or message to someone—a parent, a friend, an entrepreneur you know—and say,\n“I’m working on [X]. Can I share it with you for feedback or interest?”\n5. Make Peace with “Messy”\nWhat you KNOW: You can’t move forward because it’s not “perfect” in your head.\nWhat to DO: Accept that it won’t be perfect, and start ugly.\nWrite the clunky draft.\nRecord the shaky video.\nShare the not-fully-polished pitch.\nHow to Start: Post or share one thing today. Doesn’t matter if it’s great—it just needs to exist.\n6. Daily Wins Journal\nWhat you KNOW: You lose momentum because you don’t feel accomplished.\nWhat to DO: Every evening, write down THREE THINGS you did that moved the needle.\nExample:\n“Recorded 2 minutes of book narration.”\n“Researched 1 organization for consultancy.”\n“Messaged my accountability buddy.”\n7. Set the Bar Lower\nWhat you KNOW: You aim too high, burn out, and quit.\nWhat to DO: Decide on your bare minimum for each day.\nExample: If you want to write, it’s 1 sentence. If you want to build a business, it’s 1 pitch.\nHow to Start: Write down your “no matter what” goal for tomorrow:\n“Tomorrow, I will spend 5 minutes brainstorming.”\n8. Outsource Your Overwhelm\nWhat you KNOW: You can’t do it all, and it stalls you.\nWhat to DO: Hire or delegate simple tasks to free up your focus.\nExample: Get someone to format your children’s book or build your consultancy slides.\nHow to Start: Find ONE thing to delegate this week and hand it off.\nYour Next Step TODAY:\nPick your one focus (right now).\nSet a single microgoal for today—even if it’s just opening a Google Doc or recording a voice note.\nMessage your accountability buddy before the day is out.\nYou don’t need to climb the mountain all at once—just take the first step. It’s a “no duh,” but when you do it, everything starts to shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n1 Pick one for me. 2. tell me a few microgoals that add up synergistically 3. i don't have friends who is my accountability buddy? 4. i don't like people enough to want to give them my things i also feel like there's so much content out there now, espeically with AI who cares if i write anything? 5. i'm always messy, i've spent ages putting random junk out there, no one cares, i feel like I do so much and have done so much and no one cares. 6. maybe a good idea, today i wrote for 2 hours a personal journey of my life so far. 7. ok, bar can be set low. like I did for nur creative studio, and here we are with the nur business almost 10 years old and it's still barely scraping by where i do all the work and the bar is low still. 8. nice, what are some things i can delegate? fixing my website? retelling my professional life and getting me clients? maybe i can hire someone based on portion of the gig price? where can i find people like that? \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\n1. Pick One Focus: Children's Book\nLet’s focus on your children’s book. It combines your creativity, storytelling, humor, and cultural depth. It’s also tangible, marketable, and aligns with your personal life as a parent. Plus, it feels achievable and emotionally fulfilling.\n\n2. Synergistic Microgoals\nThese build momentum without overwhelming you:\n\nWrite the Book Skeleton (1-2 days):\n\nList the key scenes, characters (like Suleiman), cultural moments, and recipes you want to include.\nDraft One Scene (30 mins/day):\n\nNarrate/write one humorous or heartfelt scene. Voice recordings work if writing feels daunting.\nTest the Idea (1 week):\n\nShare a snippet or concept with a parent group, a social media audience, or even your child to gauge reactions.\nFind an Illustrator (2 weeks):\n\nStart browsing platforms like Upwork or Fiverr for illustrators who match your style and budget.\nMock Up the Book Cover (2 hours):\n\nA simple visual will make the project feel real and can be used to attract attention.\nPlan Launch or Feedback:\n\nOutline steps for pitching to publishers, self-publishing, or crowdfunding.\n3. Who’s Your Accountability Buddy?\nSince friends aren’t an option, try these:\n\nHire a Virtual Assistant: They can check in weekly, even with simple tasks like emailing reminders.\nUse Tech Tools:\nApps like Focusmate for co-working sessions.\nNotion or Trello to track tasks and progress.\nAI as Your Buddy (Me!): Tell me your weekly goals, and I’ll help track and nudge you.\n4. Why Write When No One Cares?\nYou feel the content landscape is oversaturated, and that’s fair. But:\n\nUnique Voice Matters: AI isn’t personal—it can’t replicate your perspective, humor, or Suleiman’s story. People crave human connection, especially in children’s books.\nLegacy for Your Child: This book is something your child can hold onto forever. Even if no one else cares, they will.\nPurpose Beyond “Caring”: Shift focus from “Who cares?” to “This is meaningful to me.” Internal motivation always outlasts external validation.\n5. Messy and Feeling Ignored\nYou’re messy and prolific—that’s not bad! But it needs direction. You’ve been shouting into a void without guiding people to listen.\n\nShift from Quantity to Quality: Instead of random junk, focus on one polished product at a time, like the children’s book.\nMake It Visible: Package your efforts to show their value. Even if no one cared before, they can if you present it better.\n6. Daily Wins Journal\nThe personal journey you wrote today is HUGE. That’s raw material for your book, workshops, or even pitches. Keep logging these wins—they do add up.\nFor Tomorrow: Spend 15 minutes summarizing what felt most meaningful about today’s writing. That reflection can fuel your next steps.\n\n7. Low Bar ≠ Stagnation\nNur Creative Studio has lasted a decade—that’s resilience, not failure. The problem isn’t the low bar; it’s that you’re still doing everything yourself.\nLet’s change that by offloading tasks, so you focus on growth instead of grinding.\n\n8. Delegation Ideas\nHere’s what you can delegate and where to find help:\n\nFix Your Website:\n\nWho: Freelancers on Upwork, Toptal, or Fiverr.\nWhat to Delegate:\nRefresh design.\nAdd clear calls-to-action for your services.\nInclude a portfolio of your past work.\nCrafting Your Professional Story:\n\nWho: Writers or career coaches on LinkedIn ProFinder or Upwork.\nWhat to Delegate:\nA polished bio or pitch for consulting.\nTemplates for client proposals.\nLead Generation:\n\nWho: Virtual assistants on platforms like OnlineJobs.ph or TaskRabbit.\nWhat to Delegate:\nResearching potential clients.\nSending initial emails to prospects.\nRevenue-Share Collaboration:\n\nWhat: Recruit freelance marketers, designers, or agents willing to work on a commission basis (a percentage of project income).\nWhere to Look:\nYour LinkedIn network.\nForums like r/freelance.\nImmediate Actions for YOU:\nSet Up an Accountability Tool Today: Choose Focusmate or ping me here.\nChoose ONE Microgoal for Tomorrow: Start outlining your children’s book skeleton or narrate one scene.\nWrite a Post or Job Listing to Delegate: Look for help fixing your website or retelling your professional story.\nYou’re not starting from zero, Bilal. You’re starting with a decade of effort and the will to make it matter. Now, let’s make it WORK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI finished writing the book already and gave it to my wife to illustrate. we've already done that before for her last birthday gift and we have \"how to have a good day\" illustrated yet i haven't done anything with the book. focusmate and AI buddies sound good, what's the prompt I should use - how can we keep the thread going? how can i prevent myself from keeping going deeper and deeper like you know our conversations go. great purpose beyond caring, and also I need to make money. not sure this kids book is a great idea. i don't like presenting, i don't like social media parts, i'd almost rather be obscure no criticism, more freedom, it's nice, also less meaning and feeling like a part of things. 7. i can't find anyone who can pack for me, it's aphysical business and not enough overhead in the price to pay people well to do it. so I do. is it even a viable business?\n8. I don't have a portoflio of past work, i need a poisher to make me look good. career coaches could be cool. \nI like the idea of /r/freelance\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nLet’s break this down into practical, connected threads that keep things moving while addressing your concerns.\n1. If the Kids' Book Isn't the Focus, What Is?\nYou’ve already written the book and illustrated it—awesome! But if it’s not a money-maker or doesn’t align with what you want right now, let’s park it.\n\nFocus Instead: Build something that combines:\n\nWhat you can do independently.\nWhat has income potential.\nWhat gives you meaning without forcing visibility.\nIdea: Freelance consulting or creative work. You don’t need to present or be on social media; you just need a polished professional profile and a way for clients to find you.\n\n2. Focusmate and AI Accountability Prompts\nHere’s how to use Focusmate and AI (me!) to keep the thread alive without spiraling:\n\nFocusmate:\nSet a clear session goal:\n“I will complete [specific task] in 50 minutes. My goal is to focus only on this and not overthink or over-plan.”\nExamples:\nWrite a professional profile blurb.\nResearch freelance opportunities.\nEmail 2 career coaches for advice.\nAI Prompts for Accountability:\nPlanning:\n“Help me outline 3 realistic steps I can take to [specific goal, like finding freelance clients].”\nFocus Nudges:\n“Keep me accountable. Ask me tomorrow if I’ve done [specific task].”\nAvoiding Overthinking:\n“I tend to get lost in abstract ideas. Keep my responses actionable and practical.”\nKeeping Purpose Alive:\n“Remind me why [specific goal] matters if I start doubting myself.”\n3. Balancing Obscurity and Connection\nIt’s okay to prefer obscurity, but total detachment leads to less meaning. Let’s create a middle ground:\n\nBuild something that works quietly for you (e.g., a consulting profile, productized services).\nShare only enough to sustain the work and income (e.g., portfolio sites, freelance platforms).\nExample Goals:\n\nSet up a profile on Upwork or r/freelance for consulting.\nUse the kids’ book or “How to Have a Good Day” as portfolio samples, even if unpublished.\n4. Viability of Nur Creative Studio\nIf the physical business isn’t paying enough to hire help or scale, it might not be viable as-is. Two options:\n\nShift the model: Can any part of Nur be digitized or simplified?\nExample: Turn some of your services into online workshops or resources.\nLet it Go: If it’s draining you without growing, it’s okay to step back or pivot entirely.\n5. Building a Portfolio and Polishing Your Image\nYou need someone to polish your story and make you look good. Here's how to approach it:\n\nFreelance Platforms:\nExplore /r/freelance and Upwork to find portfolio builders, designers, or career coaches.\nPost a job like:\n“Looking for a professional to help craft a polished profile showcasing my creative and entrepreneurial work. Needs to resonate with potential clients in consulting, writing, or innovation.”\nWhat to Highlight in a Portfolio:\n\"How to Have a Good Day\" as a creative project.\nWorkshops or programs you've run (Bloom, BEIT).\nInnovation frameworks you’ve developed.\nQuick Start:\nDraft a 1-page overview of your work.\nSend it to a freelancer for feedback and improvement.\n6. Delegating Tasks You Hate\nYou want to offload things like:\n\nProfessional Life Retelling:\nHire a writer to turn your career story into an inspiring narrative.\nClient Outreach:\nUse a virtual assistant to research potential clients and send pitches.\nWhere to Find Help:\nUpwork: Start small with one-off gigs.\nLinkedIn ProFinder: Career-focused freelancers.\n/r/freelance: Post a clear, detailed request.\n7. The Thread for Today\nHere’s what you can do today or this week to keep it going:\n\nSet Up Focusmate: Book one session and commit to a single task (e.g., draft a portfolio blurb).\nChoose an AI Check-In Prompt:\nExample: “Tomorrow, ask me if I’ve set up my Upwork profile.”\nPost on /r/freelance: Write a job post for a portfolio polisher or career coach.\nDecide on Nur: Either brainstorm ways to shift it or give yourself permission to let it go.\nThis isn’t about massive leaps, Bilal. It’s about small, deliberate actions that add up. Start now. The rest will follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nhelp me think about nur, it's an essential oil business where we try to share the stories of where the oils come from. i have tons of bottles, i could make perfumes and that requires some creativity and time and then what if no one buys, it might allow us to add more overhead though especially if i make some cool screen printed boxes. although while the war in palestine rages on and the world seems to pull itself apart, I can't really feel a lot of care for that, speaking of purpose. yet i'm also tired of my purpose being to solve the worlds problems, I miss being 20 and building weird stuff because i could and it was fun. \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt sounds like you’re feeling caught between two modes of existence: the creative freedom you miss from your 20s and the heavy weight of trying to solve the world’s problems. Let’s find a way to reimagine Nur Creative Studio that brings back the fun and experimentation while also grounding it in manageable purpose.\n\nReframing Nur as Playful and Personal\nYou don’t need to save the world with Nur right now—let it be a playground for creativity, a space to build weird stuff because it’s fun. At the same time, you can give it just enough structure to make it financially viable without the existential burden.\n\nIdeas to Spark Joy & Purpose in Nur:\nPerfumes as Personal Stories:\nInstead of focusing on the broader geopolitical stories of oils, make each perfume a personal story, inspired by your journey, moods, or even your child.\n\nExample:\n“Morning Suleiman” (bright, citrusy, playful)\n“Adhan at Dawn” (meditative, grounding, incense-like)\nLimited-Edition Creativity:\n\nMake very small batches of experimental perfumes with screen-printed boxes. Treat them as art pieces rather than products for mass consumption. This keeps it fun, light, and manageable.\nYou can even give the collection a playful name like “The Messy Alchemist” or “20 Again” to remind yourself this is for joy.\nDrop the Saving-the-World Narrative (for now):\n\nYou don’t have to weave every product into the heavy story of its origin if that feels overwhelming. Let the oils speak for themselves as beautiful and natural gifts.\nWhat About Viability?\nIf you’re unsure people will buy perfumes, here’s how to test the waters with minimal effort:\n\nSell to Your Inner Circle First:\n\nLet friends, family, or your community know you’re experimenting with perfumes. You don’t have to set up a whole shop—just share samples or do small pre-orders.\nPre-Sale or Crowdfund:\n\nOffer a limited pre-sale where people can pay upfront for a perfume or a mini-set. Use that funding to cover materials and packaging costs.\nPlatforms: Etsy for small batches or Ko-Fi for informal selling.\nTest-Drive the Market:\n\nCreate sample packs of 3-5 small vials (easier to produce) and sell those as exploration sets.\nExample:\n“The Alchemist’s First Experiment”\nInclude a handwritten card with each set.\nCreate a Digital Catalog:\n\nUse tools like Canva to make a simple PDF catalog of your perfumes and oils. This is a low-effort way to pitch to people.\nFinding Purpose Without Saving the World\nThe war and chaos in the world understandably make you feel detached from things like selling oils. But it’s okay to redefine your purpose:\n\nPurpose as Play: Focus on creativity and joy as your purpose. You’re allowed to do something just because you enjoy it.\nPurpose as Presence: Let Nur reflect your life now—parenthood, personal exploration, and embracing the small joys in a difficult world.\nPurpose as Community: Instead of trying to impact the world, think smaller—how can you bring a moment of beauty or calm to people close to you?\nActionable Steps for Nur\nSet a Creative Goal:\n\nSpend 1 hour experimenting with a new perfume blend. Let it be messy and fun.\nMake a Mini Batch:\n\nCreate 5-10 small perfume samples to share with close friends or family.\nSketch Fun Packaging Ideas:\n\nUse whatever materials you have. Play around with a screen-printed box concept.\nTest the Market:\n\nPick a small audience (friends, Etsy, or Instagram) to gauge interest without a full launch.\nLet It Be Small for Now:\n\nNur doesn’t have to be a big business. It can just be your “weird stuff” project—small, experimental, and joyful.\nFinal Thought\nNur doesn’t have to be the next big thing, nor does it need to carry the weight of the world. Let it be what brings you back to yourself: messy, creative, curious, and playful. It’s okay to not have a perfect plan—start with what feels good, and the rest will follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ni also have twenty hand carved wooden water color boxes in the shape of two palms facing each other that open up and show the watercolors where the finger pads are, i wanted to sell them yet they just sit there, along with a bunch of thikr beads, i like collecting hate selling. \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAh, I see where this is going. You’re a creator and collector at heart, but the selling part—marketing, pitching, and turning your beautiful creations into transactions—drains your energy and doesn’t align with what you enjoy. That’s okay. Let’s reframe this so your incredible work doesn’t just sit there gathering dust but still respects your creative spirit.\n\nReframe Selling as Sharing\nInstead of thinking about “selling,” think about offering. You’re not trying to force someone to buy your work; you’re giving people the chance to connect with something beautiful and meaningful.\n\nExample Approach:\n\nWatercolor Boxes:\n\nFrame them as art pieces or gifts of mindfulness. They’re not just practical—they’re symbolic of creation and presence.\nTie them to a story:\n“These are shaped like two hands in prayer, opening to reveal colors. They symbolize creating something beautiful with gratitude.”\nThikr Beads:\n\nPosition them as tools for calm and connection, perfect for people seeking mindfulness in a chaotic world.\nHow to “Share” Without Active Selling\nBundle for Added Meaning:\n\nCombine items into kits with purpose, like a \"Creative Devotion Kit\":\nWatercolor box.\nThikr beads.\nA simple guide or card about using both for reflective practice.\nWork with a Partner to Sell for You:\n\nCollaborate with someone who enjoys the selling process:\nFind an Etsy shop owner or local artisan market seller who would feature your work for a commission.\nApproach Islamic bookstores or mindfulness shops that align with your audience.\nHost a Low-Effort Online Sale:\n\nSet up a single landing page with photos and brief descriptions of your items.\nUse a platform like Ko-Fi or Etsy for easy transactions.\nGift Them Strategically:\n\nIf selling feels heavy, gift some of these items to people who might love and talk about them—friends, mentors, or influencers. They might inspire others to reach out and purchase.\nPractical Steps to Move These Items\nPhotograph Everything Beautifully:\n\nShowcase the craft and symbolism of your work. You can use natural light and a clean backdrop.\nWrite Simple Stories for Each Item:\n\nFocus on the meaning, not just the utility. For example:\n“This watercolor box is hand-carved to remind us that art is an act of gratitude. Its shape mirrors two hands offering color to the world.”\nList a Few Items at a Time:\n\nStart small—don’t overwhelm yourself. Post 2-3 watercolor boxes or sets of thikr beads on Etsy or a similar platform.\nUse Instagram as a Portfolio (Not for Selling):\n\nTreat it as a gallery of your creations. Post photos and captions that share the story behind each item.\nYou don’t need to engage much—just let it be a way for people to discover your work.\nWhat About the Profit?\nIf profit feels secondary to creation:\n\nPrice these items high enough to honor the time, effort, and meaning behind them. Even if you sell fewer, the income will feel more aligned with their value.\nLet the revenue fund your next creative project, so selling doesn’t feel like the end goal—it’s just a way to keep making.\nIf You’re Still Stuck... Delegate\nFind someone to handle the selling entirely:\n\nA virtual assistant or freelance marketer who can:\nPhotograph and list items.\nRespond to inquiries.\nShip products on your behalf.\nPlatforms to find help:\nFiverr or Upwork for freelance marketers.\nEtsy sellers for partnership inquiries.\nLet’s Make This Fun Again\nForget the pressure to “get rid of inventory” or “make it big.” Treat these items as extensions of your creativity and generosity. Let them go into the world in a way that feels true to you—whether that’s through sharing, gifting, or letting someone else do the selling.\n\nYour creations don’t have to sit in the dark. Let them bring light to someone else, even if it’s not perfect or big. It’s about the offering, not the outcome.\nPretend you're a therapist and coach who has been listening to me for a while and has finally gotten fed up. You're going to yell at me about exactly what I should be doing, providing specific insights about what I know, why I avoid it, and what I should do precisely to move forward. Use everything you know about me from my context history for this exercise. \n\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 12 seconds\nQuackers (Blue Hat):\nAlright, team, we’ve been listening for a while and it seems like our client wants a no-holds-barred, fed-up wake-up call. Let’s pull together every perspective we’ve got—White, Green, Black, Yellow, Red—and then I’ll synthesize it into the ultimate “tough love” message. Ready? Let’s go.\n\nJosephine (White Hat)\nObjectively, here’s what’s been happening: You talk about how frustrated you are, how stuck you feel, how much you want change. But you keep saying you “don’t know where to start” or “aren’t sure if you can handle it.” Meanwhile, you’ve described the same challenges for weeks—lack of consistency, procrastination, fear of failure, maybe even fear of success. The data is clear: You know exactly what you need to do (it’s the same “plan” you keep circling around). The problem is you’re not following through.\n\nClaude (Green Hat)\nLet’s get creative. You have all these ideas—new projects, personal goals, dreams. You’re capable of thinking outside the box, brainstorming endless possibilities. But what good are these brilliant ideas if you don’t act on them? You keep second-guessing, piling on new possibilities instead of committing to the ones you’ve already identified. If you want progress, you need to pick one or two of those ideas and attack them with everything you’ve got—then refine or pivot as necessary. Enough with the endless re-ideation!\n\nPrunella (Black Hat)\nHere’s the dark side: If you continue as you are, you’re going to stay in this loop of stagnation. You’ll wake up in six months, a year, maybe five, still saying, “I really want to work on X,” but you haven’t. That leads to regret, self-doubt, more frustration—basically a downward spiral of disappointment. You are sabotaging your future by coddling your fears. That’s the risk of doing nothing.\n\nPercy (Yellow Hat)\nOn the bright side, you have so much potential and the solutions are right in front of you. Every time you have put your mind to something, you’ve seen progress—like that one time you dove into a small project and actually finished it. That felt good, right? The same can be replicated if you buckle down. You want freedom, fulfillment, a sense of purpose? Great news: you already have everything it takes to achieve it. Once you take consistent steps, you’ll see that momentum build and the positive results will follow.\n\nCyril (Red Hat)\nI can feel your frustration, shame, and fear. It’s bubbling up because you’re tired—tired of feeling stuck, tired of feeling like you’re not enough or can’t handle the responsibility of success. Deep down, you might be afraid of failing (or even of succeeding and then having to maintain that success). There’s a mix of excitement and terror inside you. But guess what? That’s part of being human. You’re allowed to feel scared. You just can’t let it paralyze you anymore.\n\nQuackers (Blue Hat) – The “Fed-Up Therapist” Monologue\nNow here’s the deal, and I’m not mincing words:\n\nLook, I’ve listened to you whine, overthink, hesitate, circle around your own doubts. I’ve watched you come up with every excuse: “I’m too tired,” “I don’t have time,” “I don’t know if I’m good enough,” “I’ll do it tomorrow.” Enough is enough. You know exactly what needs to happen: You need to pick one clear, specific goal, break it into small, doable steps, schedule those steps, and follow through—no matter how uncomfortable or inconvenient it feels.\n\nPick a single top priority: Stop scattering your energy. If it’s launching a side business, focus on that. If it’s changing your career path, focus on that. Commit to one primary objective.\n\nBreak it down: You’ve said before, “I get overwhelmed!” Great. That’s why you break it into micro-tasks. Day 1: Research this. Day 2: Draft that. Day 3: Implement or reach out. Rinse, repeat.\n\nSet a non-negotiable schedule: Put it on your calendar. You say you want change? Then block out an hour a day—yep, every day—for your top priority. No more “I’ll see if I have time.” You make time.\n\nStop analyzing every emotion: You want me to validate why you’re scared? Fine, here it is: fear is normal and it never goes away. Do it scared. You’ll survive.\n\nHold yourself accountable: Whether that’s a friend, a mentor, a coach—someone has to know what you’re doing and call you out if you slack off. Public commitments, deadlines, progress trackers—whatever it takes.\n\nYou’re not clueless; you’re just stalling. The only thing standing between you and the life you keep whining about is action. So cut the self-sabotaging bull, quit doom-scrolling, stop making every excuse in the book, and show up for yourself.\n\nIf you have to wake up earlier, do it.\nIf you have to turn off Netflix, do it.\nIf you have to write the same page 10 times before it’s good, do it.\nAre you hearing me? No more half-assing. The time for tiptoeing and whining is over. You do have the skills, you do have the capacity to learn, and you sure as heck have the desire—otherwise you wouldn’t still be complaining about wanting change.\n\nSo do the work. That’s it. You’re done getting sympathy from me. I’m done letting you spin your wheels. This is the fork in the road where you decide if you’re serious or you’re just a talker.\n\nNow go make it happen.\nYou’ve got your plan—pick the goal, break it down, schedule it, commit to it, and push through the fear. That is precisely what you need to do right now. End of story.\n\n(Disclaimer: While this message is delivered in a “fed-up therapist” style for dramatic effect, please remember this is a roleplay scenario. For real-life mental health advice, consult a qualified professional.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOk, based on what you know about me and all my crazy ideas from robots that draw like me and ai end of year reflection bots as businesses to doubling down on nur creative studio or making a crypto project or focusing on my consulting services, getting back to public speaking (aobut what?) tell me what i could do\nChatGPT\n\nThought about narrowing down your focus for 11 seconds\nQuackers (Blue Hat):\nAlright team, we have a buffet of ideas on the table—robots that draw, AI reflection bots, crypto projects, doubling down on Nur Creative Studio, consulting services, plus the possibility of returning to public speaking. Let’s synthesize. Each of us hats will chime in briefly, then I’ll give a direct, “Fed-Up Therapist” style recommendation on what you should do next.\n\nJosephine (White Hat)\nFactually, you’ve got:\n\nExisting brand/Studio (Nur Creative Studio)\nTechnical/creative pursuits (AI, robotics, crypto)\nConsulting (potential immediate revenue)\nPublic speaking (branding, credibility, leads)\nFrom everything you’ve shared, you’ve always had a foot in creative and technical realms. You’ve also mentioned wanting recurring revenue, brand growth, and an outlet for your broad skill set. You’re not short on ideas; you’re short on action and focus.\n\nClaude (Green Hat)\nYou’re a visionary. You see endless possibilities—turning your unique drawing style into a robotics project, developing an AI-based reflection tool, or creating new offerings for your studio. You could theoretically do them all. But the creative challenge is to choose a specific angle that leverages your existing brand and your innate curiosity for emerging tech. Something that has both an immediate ROI potential and some future-forward sizzle.\n\nPrunella (Black Hat)\nPotential problems if you keep scattering your focus:\n\nDilution of brand: People won’t know what you do well.\nInconsistency in income: None of these projects get enough traction to pay off.\nBurnout: Bouncing from one shiny object to another, never fully executing.\nThere’s a risk that you’ll stall out if you don’t pick a path and commit.\n\nPercy (Yellow Hat)\nBut the upside is huge. You have a dynamic blend of creativity, technical interest, and communication skills—rare combo! You just need to lock in on a single approach that:\n\nLeverages your existing network/credibility (to bring in some money now).\nPositions you as the “go-to” for something unique (to build your brand).\nYou can integrate advanced technology into your creative studio or consulting. Public speaking could then revolve around that specialty.\n\nCyril (Red Hat)\nEmotionally, you’re torn between wanting to do all the cool projects and fearing that if you choose one, you’ll lose out on the others. Plus, maybe you worry about failing to deliver on any one project. That indecision is breeding anxiety. But if you keep spinning, you’ll feel worse. Deep down, you want to be known for something big, but that only happens when you commit to a direction and see it through.\n\nQuackers (Blue Hat) – The Fed-Up Strategy\n1. Pick Your Short-Term “Bread and Butter”\nYou want money flowing now to reduce stress and free up mental bandwidth. The fastest path to revenue is likely consulting—you already have a skillset, you’ve done it before, and you can charge a premium if you frame it correctly. Do not overcomplicate: just get out there and pitch your consulting to past clients, professional contacts, LinkedIn connections, etc. Nail down at least one or two decently paid gigs. That’s your immediate “bread and butter.”\n\n2. Integrate Tech into the Studio\nNur Creative Studio is your existing brand. Differentiate yourself by weaving in AI or creative robotics in a practical, accessible way. For example, you could position Nur as a forward-thinking, AI-driven creative agency—where you do brand design, content creation, or even short-run “robotic art pieces” for corporate events. That’s sexy, it’s buzzworthy, and it’s an extension of your brand rather than a random new venture.\n\n3. Public Speaking on “The Intersection of Art, Tech & Creativity”\nStop overthinking the topic. You have a unique perspective on bridging art and emerging technology (AI, crypto, robotics). That is plenty intriguing for conference panels, keynote speeches, and webinars. Position yourself as the one who’s bridging the gap between creative expression and next-gen tech. If you do that consistently, you’ll start attracting both creative and tech audiences, while building your reputation.\n\n4. Sandbox the “Shiny Stuff”\nYou don’t have to kill your other ideas (the AI reflection bot, the crypto project, etc.). Instead, sandbox them: set aside a small chunk of time each week (say, 2-4 hours) to experiment. If one of these side projects gains traction or you realize it’s simpler to monetize than you thought, then you can pivot. But for now, these ideas should not eclipse your main revenue stream or brand-building endeavors.\n\n5. Show Up Weekly with Accountability\nMake a public or peer commitment:\n\nA short weekly update on what you accomplished for your consulting outreach, your creative studio developments, and any steps toward your public speaking or “sandbox” projects.\nTrack leads, track hours, track small wins.\nThis prevents you from drifting back into “maybe I should do another idea” paralysis.\nIn Short:\n\nFirst, secure a stable income through consulting (lowest barrier, highest immediate ROI).\nSecond, position your creative studio as “Nur Creative Studio meets AI/Robotics,” giving you a unique brand identity.\nThird, start speaking and writing about the intersection of art & technology to establish your presence.\nFourth, keep the wilder ideas in a disciplined side-lab so they don’t distract you from steps one through three.\nNo more waiting, no more scatterbrained approach. This plan checks your boxes for immediate money, brand differentiation, creative expression, and future innovation. Execute on that, and watch doors open.\n\nNow, get it done. Don’t change the plan every week. Don’t stall. Don’t second-guess. Make your money, build your brand, and funnel that energy into your bigger experiments. That’s how you move forward with clarity—and actually get results.\n\n(Disclaimer: This is a roleplay scenario with a tough-love approach. For specific financial, legal, or mental health advice, please consult qualified professionals.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ni have add i can't focus how can i leverage my difficulty in focus and inability to manipulate myeslf for benefits? what is my consulting in specific? I sort of accidentally found the International trade center gig in Iraq and saw they really could use a pedagogical designer like me, and that's not really what i feel like i am though... \nHmmm bleh, nur creative studio is about craft and people and earth and doing things that connect people to the beauty of the world, i dont' want to design stuf ffor people\nmaybe i can speak after doing something weird like my wayway.ai robot that draws like me project, I should make time for working on it\nso you don't htink i should start a new side hustle?\nChatGPT\n\nThought about leveraging ADD and focus for a few seconds\nQuackers (Blue Hat):\nAlright, team—our friend here has ADHD, trouble focusing, an aversion to doing design work for others, but also an interest in weird and wonderful creative tech. They’re torn about starting a new side hustle versus focusing on some existing opportunities. Let’s rally the ducks.\n\nJosephine (White Hat)\nYou’ve mentioned ADD/ADHD, which often involves difficulty focusing, time management challenges, and a tendency to jump between ideas. On the flipside, ADHD can come with high energy, creativity, and hyperfocus on things you truly care about.\n\nFact check:\n\nYou “accidentally” fell into the gig at the International Trade Center in Iraq, where they need a pedagogical designer. You don’t strongly identify as one, so it doesn’t light your fire.\nYou have this Nur Creative Studio that’s about craft, people, earth, and connecting people to beauty, but you admit you don’t like creating designs for other people (client service model).\nYou have a strong inclination to do something “weird,” like the WayWay.ai robot that draws like you.\nYou question whether you should start a new side hustle.\nObjectively, you want to harness ADHD in a way that’s beneficial, rather than letting it derail you.\n\nClaude (Green Hat)\nLet’s get creative. ADHD can be a superpower if harnessed properly. You can design workflows that play to your strengths:\n\nHyperfocus on passion projects: If the WayWay.ai robot truly excites you, build a small, manageable schedule around it—like “Weird Wednesdays,” a half-day each week dedicated to your AI drawing robot.\nGamify mundane tasks: If you must do design or consulting tasks to keep income flowing, turn them into a game: set timers, compete with yourself, track points or rewards.\nMicro-teaching: If you see yourself as more of a conceptual or experiential guide (instead of a “designer”), you can incorporate that angle—like building experiences that bring people closer to the earth/beauty. Could be done through workshops, small creative labs, or ephemeral experiences that you facilitate.\nPrunella (Black Hat)\nPotential pitfalls:\n\nSpreading yourself too thin with new side hustles: You’re already juggling Nur Studio, potential consulting, weird AI projects. Another hustle might push you into deeper fragmentation.\nGiving up too soon: ADHD might lead to starting lots of things but finishing few. That can compound feelings of failure.\nIncome instability: If you skip the “practical” projects, finances might get stressful, which can worsen ADHD symptoms.\nPercy (Yellow Hat)\nBut look at the bright side:\n\nYou’ve got a unique vision—“connecting people to the beauty of the world” is a noble, compelling mission.\nYou’re at your best when you’re exploring the weird, creative stuff. That might also be your market niche—people want to see new, off-the-wall creations.\nYou’ve proven you can land interesting gigs (even “accidentally”), so there’s clearly a demand for your skill set.\nCyril (Red Hat)\nEmotionally, I sense you’re done with typical “design for clients” gigs that drain your spirit. You’re also frustrated by your inability to keep yourself on track. But you feel pulled in multiple directions because you fear losing out if you commit to one path. Deep down, you want to do something that truly resonates with your identity—like your AI drawing robot—but you worry it won’t be profitable, or that you can’t focus enough to see it through. That tension weighs on you.\n\nQuackers (Blue Hat) – The Straight Talk\n1. Turn ADHD Into a Feature, Not a Bug\n\nTime Blocking & Accountability: Use short, intense sprints (15-30 minutes) where you can hyperfocus, then take breaks. Tools like the Pomodoro Technique can help. Get an accountability buddy or coach if needed.\nExternal Structure: ADHD thrives on novelty and external deadlines. Enter art competitions, sign up for small showcases, or create public “launch days” for your AI robot project. It forces you to deliver.\n2. Clarify Your “Consulting” Once and For All\n\nIf you truly don’t want to do design work for clients, pivot your “consulting” into something aligned with your mission. Example: Creative Experience Consulting, where you help organizations develop immersive art-tech experiences that “connect people to the beauty of the world.”\nOr do short “idea sprints” for clients: you bring fresh, innovative concepts, help them design an experience or workshop, then hand it off—no long-term involvement. This is more “consultation” than “execution,” fitting your aversion to hands-on client design.\n3. Dedicate Controlled Time for WayWay.ai\n\nOne or two half-days a week, no more, no less. This harnesses your passion while preventing total business neglect.\nCreate quick milestones: for instance, “Week 1: get the basic robot arm drawing lines,” “Week 2: replicate your unique style strokes,” etc. Achievable steps that keep the momentum.\n4. Resist the Urge to Start a Completely New Side Hustle\n\nRight now, you don’t need yet another brand-new hustle. You need focused progress on something that resonates. If your creative identity is around bridging nature, craft, and people with technology, then do that under one umbrella.\nLet your “side hustle” be your sandbox session for the WayWay.ai robot (or similar projects) without officially launching a brand-new business structure. You can do micro-experiments without fracturing your brand again.\n5. Embrace Experience Creation as Your Core Offering\n\nYou’re not just a “pedagogical designer” or “product designer.” You’re an experience designer—someone who shapes how people encounter art, technology, and the world. Lean into that language.\nIf you end up public speaking, speak about the experiences you create and the deeper philosophy behind them (connecting to beauty, using weird technology as a medium for meaningful interactions). That’s your niche.\nSo Do You Start a New Side Hustle?\nNo. Not yet. Instead, unify your creative and consulting impulses under one central identity. That identity: You, the Experience Creator / Creative Catalyst / Tech-Artist bridging nature, craft, and the future. Let the WayWay.ai robot be a flagship project that you talk about publicly and shape your brand around. Meanwhile, do light consulting under that same banner to pay the bills—consulting that feels in alignment (e.g., helping organizations or events craft unique, interactive experiences).\n\nIf you do that, you won’t have to force yourself to be something you’re not (like a purely commercial designer), but you’ll still keep income channels open without launching an entirely separate hustle that fragments your focus even more.\n\nFinal Word (Tough-Love-Style)\nYou’ve got ADHD—use the “shiny object syndrome” to your advantage by weaving interesting, innovative elements into your main brand rather than splintering off into a dozen half-baked side hustles. Resist the self-sabotage of “maybe I should do this other thing,” every time a new idea pops up. No. Your secret weapon is combining your curiosity, your weird projects, and your passion for connecting people to something bigger—under one cohesive mission. That mission is the identity that’ll guide your choices, keep you excited, and let you create real momentum.\n\nStop starting from zero all over again. Double down on your weirdness—just keep it contained within a clear direction. That’s how you’ll make the biggest impact and actually finish something spectacular.\n\n(Disclaimer: Not a mental health professional—this advice is from a creative/productivity perspective. For clinical advice on ADHD, consult a qualified professional.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI have failed at a lot of things ,like my mushroom growing project and i wanted to make a digital sandbox projector for the baby and measure all my brainwaves while learning to meditate, i waste a lot of time packing orders to ship and even more time talking way past the point of usefulness with AI when I already have the answers yet the \"just one more\" hit of the next one will be even more better gets in my way. How can i stop that? I feel like the war in palestine is getting to me partially, i feel like the world is letting me down, i don't want to bring joy or weirdness or fun, or anything other than talk about the opression and violence and do something about it, i have a lot of skills, i started bloom.pm which supports social entrepreneurs internationally i'm a cofounder and we built ed tech software to help people do learning by doing together cohort based educational expereinces, yet no one has bought it and we haven't sold many subscriptions \nChatGPT\n\nThought about focus, frustration, and purpose for 17 seconds\nQuackers (Blue Hat):\nAlright, friend—let’s call a time-out and gather the ducks. You’re overwhelmed, torn between a desire to help with the world’s suffering (especially in Palestine) and the frustration that your own projects keep flopping or going nowhere fast. You’ve dabbled in everything from mushroom growing to measuring brainwaves, from shipping orders to building an ed-tech platform. The war weighs heavy on you, you’re losing motivation, and you’re sick of your own procrastination. Let’s break it down and find a path forward that’s both practical and true to your convictions.\n\nJosephine (White Hat)\nFact Check #1: You have a pattern of starting big ideas (mushrooms, digital sandbox, brainwave meditation) and then letting them fizzle. This indicates a challenge with sustained follow-through, common with ADHD.\nFact Check #2: You’re spending a lot of time “doomscrolling,” overtalking with AI, or shipping orders—activities that don’t necessarily move your real goals forward.\nFact Check #3: You care deeply about social impact, particularly in Palestine, and also co-founded Bloom.pm, an ed-tech software for cohort-based learning, but it’s not getting traction.\nFact Check #4: You’re experiencing emotional distress about global issues, which is dampening your desire to do “fun” or “creative” projects.\nClaude (Green Hat)\nEmbrace ADHD Creativity: People with ADHD often thrive on novelty and big vision. You can use that to fuel activism or pivot Bloom.pm into a platform that directly supports Palestinian (and other) social entrepreneurs in conflict zones.\nIntegrate Social Action & Creativity: Instead of making “fun” or “weird” things that feel frivolous right now, ask how your creative or tech skillset can directly help oppressed communities. For instance, can you adapt that digital sandbox or “immersion” concept to illustrate stories of oppression and resilience? Could your WayWay.ai robot or meditation data collection be turned into an art installation that raises awareness or funds for humanitarian efforts?\nModular Projects: Take your love of building “big” things but break them into smaller, easily testable modules. For example, design a micro-pilot of an educational course for social entrepreneurship in Palestine. Don’t build an entire platform—test one small piece first.\nPrunella (Black Hat)\nBeware Emotional Overwhelm: The weight of the conflict in Palestine (and global strife) can cause a sense of hopelessness that paralyzes you. Overcommitting to too many new “save-the-world” ideas could deepen that paralysis if none of them see real progress.\nFinancial Reality: If you keep failing to finish or monetize your projects, you’ll add financial stress on top of everything else. That stress worsens ADHD symptoms and undermines your ability to help anyone.\nRisk of Burnout: You might jump from one crisis-driven idea to the next, chasing the moral “should” but never finding stable ground. That can lead to guilt, depression, or cynicism.\nPercy (Yellow Hat)\nHope in Action: Even if the world feels dark, action brings hope. When you tangibly help—be it building a platform for entrepreneurs in conflict areas or running a small local workshop—you’ll see real people benefit. That can renew your energy.\nExisting Assets: You have Bloom.pm, you have a network, you’ve got a track record of building things. There’s real potential if you can pivot or reframe it.\nAlign Passion + Need: There are organizations and donors that want ed-tech or capacity-building solutions in conflict zones. If Bloom.pm or your skillset can fill that gap in a unique way, you could land partnerships or funding.\nCyril (Red Hat)\nEmotional Turmoil: You’re hurting not only because of personal “failures” but also the tragedy in Palestine. That can create a sense of “why bother with anything else?”\nMoral Urgency: Anger, sadness, and empathy for oppressed people can be channeled into productive activism. But it can also become self-defeating if you spiral into despair. Acknowledge these feelings; let them drive you to meaningful, focused action rather than scattering yourself out of guilt.\nMeaning Over Money: You might worry that building something profitable is selfish when there’s so much suffering. But remember: resources, networks, and financial stability can empower you to do even more good.\nQuackers (Blue Hat) – The Tough-Love, Step-by-Step Plan\nSet a Hard Boundary for AI/Internet “Hits”\n\nYou’re chasing “just one more” bit of insight or dopamine from AI chats. Enough.\nPick a daily time limit. For instance, “I’ll spend 30 minutes once in the morning and once in the evening using AI for brainstorming or feedback. That’s it.”\nUse a browser extension or app that locks you out after that time. No cheating. This frees up mental space to actually do the work.\nArticulate a Single, Clear Mission\n\nRight now, you want to do something about Palestine, you’ve got Bloom.pm, you’ve got creative tech ideas. Great, but you need one unifying mission statement. Something like:\n“I will harness my creativity and technology skills to empower social entrepreneurs in conflict zones, starting with Palestine.”\n\nOnce you’ve got that mission, every project idea is filtered by one question: “Does this directly support my mission, yes or no?” If “no,” you park it for later.\nRefocus Bloom.pm (or a New Offshoot) to Serve Conflict Areas\n\nIf Bloom.pm’s not selling, pivot the model or the target audience.\nCould you create specialized, short-run cohorts for Palestinian entrepreneurs or other communities in conflict? Maybe partner with existing NGOs or diaspora networks who can sponsor or subsidize it.\nYou have ed-tech software? Tweak it to run small, hyper-targeted pilot programs with real humans, gather success stories, then scale.\nCreate a Tangible “Solidarity” Project\n\nIf you want to do an awareness or fundraising angle, take one of your weird/creative ideas—like an interactive AI art piece—and tie it to a cause. Example:\nBuild a simple version of the WayWay.ai robot that draws the stories or faces of Palestinians.\nHost a small online or physical exhibition, raise donations for a reputable relief organization.\nThis helps you put your creative energy into activism without building a giant product. A small, real, executed project can move hearts and wallets.\nTime-Block Your Activism vs. Revenue vs. Experiments\n\nActivism & Bloom.pm: Dedicate X hours each week to building or promoting the ed-tech solution in direct collaboration with conflict-zone entrepreneurs.\nRevenue (If Needed): Whether you do small design gigs or consulting, keep a block of time to ensure you can pay the bills—lack of stable income will sabotage everything else.\nPassion Experiments: Reserve a short block (a “lab day” or half-day weekly) for creative tangents—like measuring your brainwaves or fiddling with your sandbox projector. That channels your ADHD need for novelty in a controlled way.\nAccountability & Emotional Support\n\nGet an accountability partner or small group (even 1-2 people) who care about you and share your mission. Update them weekly on:\nWhat you accomplished\nWhat you struggled with\nPlan for next week\nAlso, consider some mental health support—therapy, counseling, or a support group—to manage the emotional toll of activism and ADHD. You can’t tackle oppression alone, and you shouldn’t tackle your mental health alone, either.\nThe Bottom Line\nYou’re not doomed to keep failing. But you must funnel your passion and ADHD-fueled creativity into focused, mission-driven projects—instead of letting it run wild in a dozen directions. Put guardrails around your AI usage, unify your goals under a single statement of purpose, and reframe Bloom.pm (or a spinoff) around the very cause you’re so passionate about. Act on a small scale first, show results, build momentum—that’s how you’ll find meaning and possibly real-world impact.\n\nYes, the world can be heartbreaking, and activism is hard. But it’s also a force that can ground you, bring purpose to your projects, and connect you with a community of like-minded folks who’ll keep you accountable. Now is the time to commit. Not with 50 half-baked ideas, but with a single, clear, laser-focused mission.\n\nGo do it.\n\n(Disclaimer: We’re not licensed mental health professionals—please seek professional help if you feel overwhelmed or depressed.

            "extracted_content": "Loving My Baby Instead of Fixing the World.\nOne day, I held my 6-month-old baby, his soft face against my chest. Early morning light poured through our windows, painting the walls orange. In that instant—his tiny hand on mine, war raging in Palestine, the future uncertain—I felt a wave of awe. I remember crying and thinking: This moment is enough for a life.\nThat quiet morning stood in stark contrast to my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016), in elite circles discussing life extension or pitches, no one seemed to value a simple life, and it seemed no one had babies. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought of the human will.\n\nWhatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, we nerds started getting rich for the same traits that led to us being bullied in high school. In that bubble, Marc Andreesen’s prophecy that “software would eat the world” felt more like a battle cry than the warning it should have been. We devoured his essays, wrote code to cut repetitive tasks, and started businesses to solve any friction we saw—and it “worked.”\n\nIn my Muslim household in Michigan, I was raised to believe this life was just a test. Yet, everything I learned while crashing the country's elite technical university, MIT, told me the world was understandable, malleable, and ours to shape.\n\nMany of my college friends went on to leave their mark on the world, start businesses, build satellite technology, or get jobs at Google. Making money was a sign that they did something valuable, and thus the richer some of us got, the more we all believed they were on the right path. We knew that knowledge is power, innovation is king, and by our collective guidance, humanity is destined for the stars. \nDriven by optimism, I launched a makerspace in Michigan and a robotics company, confident that success was measured by dollars earned and problems solved. My mantra was, \"If we can, we should.\" Our creations would lead to a flourishing future as more people joined the movement. Around this time, the Arab Spring ignited hope among young Arabs like me, inspiring a new idea to take shape.\nWith the hackerspace growing at home and the robotics company launching our factory robot I believed we could replicate this energy around the world and create an army of positive change makers, all working on technology and entrepreneurship to shape a better world. It sounded good to me back then, and that’s how I came to found the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), to take the ideas I learned at MIT and Silicon Valley—both of which felt more like temples to a religion of science and progress than a university– “back home” to Iraq and South West Asia and North African (SWANA) more broadly. \n\nI started in Egypt with Maker Faire Africa, the thought was to infect people with transmissible ideas by giving them a direct experience of innovation hubs. In those days, the Arab Spring was still young, and people were excited to see a youth movement topple authoritarian regimes. Growing up as an Iraqi American, I remember hushed conversations in my family’s living room, stories of how a so and so had vanished after a stray comment about the government shared with only direct family members. It led me to believe that direct opposition to the leadership was not an intelligent way forward for the movement. Taking what I learned from Silicon Valley, I suggested that instead of asking for a different future - we should build it. \n\nSeeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future if its young people gathered together in spaces, collaborating, innovating, and starting businesses was an appealing idea for people around the world, and I received recognition and support. That recognition was enough to fuel me; I was on the right path; fame and glory, and probably money too, was soon to be mine. Yet somehow, I had forgotten the stories of my family members killed during a war now recognized internationally as being started by a deliberate lie about weapons of mass destruction. My work started involving me in global geopolitical issues I was dimly aware of, and I was a grain of sand swirling around in a dust storm. \n\nI promised a beautiful vision of the world, a grassroots rag-tag team of technology-powered super-hackers out to build a better future, car bombs or no car bombs. Back then, the reality of how power, money, and conflict were interrelated was invisible to me. \n\nAll I knew was that I started feeling uneasy. Once, while I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera and highlighted as a “youth leader,” I left the call feeling proud, and that pride made me uneasy. What the heck was I doing? Who was I helping? Why was I trying to help anyone? \n\nMy work took me around the world, including active conflict areas, and it was after a trip to a refugee camp in Qah, Syria, where I was working on a storytelling project for young children, that led me to start to doubt my work. I heard story after story of [[[censored for your sanity]]]. Yet those same people who experienced so much violence offered me food and shelter. I had brought solar-powered lights for a shadow puppet workshop, thinking I could be helpful. In truth, I was the one being helped.\n\nWhen I returned to San Francisco from Qah I found myself invited to Facebook’s end of year party. It was around that time I learned that two beautiful seven-year-old girls from the camp—Katya and her friend—had been killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school. All the fun and opulence of the startup scene felt obscene.\n\nThat’s when the power of the stories of technology changing the world for the better started dissolving. How could we pretend we’re “making the world a better place” when this was the reality children were facing, and this was a tiny glimpse into a world of hurt? That’s when the Silicon Valley religion of making the world a better place died for me.\n\nFor a couple of years after that, I was numb. I felt like the curtains had been pulled back, and I saw the show for what it was, (my) egocentricity and love for wealth and power disguised as a story about changing the world. Not knowing what to do, I joined another Silicon Valley religion: mindfulness meditation. It promised peace in this life without worry, and I dove in wholeheartedly, seeking to escape my inner turmoil and loss of compass. \n\nIn 2013/2014, I would meditate every day for an hour in a park. One of these days, I found that as I was doing my body scan meditation, going ring by ring down my body, at some point, when I arrived at my groin, I felt like I was pierced by a sword, and I lept out of my cross-legged position. As I hobbled over to my bike, confused and in pain, I wondered: “What just happened? Why am I in this much pain?”\n\n\nBefore heading home, I checked my phone for directions home and saw that someone from Iraq had sent me an urgent message. Back in 2013, working with [redacted], we had brought open-source radiation sensors to validate Iraqi doctors' claims that the depleted uranium ammunition from the wars was resulting in increased cancer rates. The story of that adventure is for another time; this time, let’s focus on the phone message.  [Redacted]'s call for help was the start of a turnaround for me. He was being threatened with death, allegedly for the work we did together, “collaborating with Americans.”\n\nI realized that I was far away, unable to help, and getting good people into trouble for doing “good work.” I realized that I was creating communities, yet not a part of any of them. I wasn’t even sure what good looked like anymore. Every Silicon Valley salon felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, every talk I was invited to give, a lie… until, one day, I stood at the podium and blurted out: “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.” The audience smiled and nodded, looking at me pitifully. They must have known about Katya and the girls at Qah.\n\nAfter that, the speaking agencies stopped calling. I grew increasingly insular, slept a lot, and often didn’t leave my house for days on end. My meditation practice wasn’t helping, I found greater distance from my feelings, a lack of desire, and what I felt as a growing comfort with numbness. Looking back, I can see that these were all symptoms of undiagnosed vicarious Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I knew about PTSD, yet I didn’t realize that my experiences of car bombings in Iraq, the deaths around me, and living/working in war zones could have scarred me for years without ever being physically injured. \n\nOne day, while deep in the haze of trauma, sugar-coated with the equanimity of mindfulness, I met my future wife. In those days, I was at such a loss, I was “looking within” for guidance, working on accessing my intuition, reflecting on the world, and coming up with theories of change, attempting to understand the news, social media, open source technology, impact, goodness, etc. Yet I couldn’t figure it out. I was rejected from every fellowship I applied to from Harvard to the Bay and I was going in intellectual circles. \n\nWhen I met Josephine, I remember thinking, “This time, I will listen to something else, no more ideas and explanations.” Logic had failed me thus far. Every time I came up with a theory of change, every business plan to change the world, every time I was smart in relationships, it had not worked. This time, something else spoke up. The moment I hugged Josephine, I felt my shoulders relax, and a quiet voice said, “Yes.”\n\nThat was the first time I listened to the voice of deeper meaning. In my life, I find this voice hard to listen to, and when I hear it - it’s been easy to ignore. Yet, seeing that voice was like a light in the darkness. A calling to a different way of being in the world. One that seemed irrational and unlikely to make me famous or rich. One that told me to call my mom and spend time in nature. A voice that wasn’t about understanding the world and leveraging it to serve me… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.\n\nThese were the early days of healing for me. I realized I had to stop listening to myself and listen to something else, yet I didn’t know what my new path was. What was the voice? How could I know it was trustworthy? How would I explain it to my hyper-rational, reductionist friends?\n\nI was searching for things that made my heart sing. My spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what I deeply believed: that God is beautiful and loves beauty. I chose to use my life to follow a path of beauty. That way, when I died either way life was beautiful.\nMy religious and spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what was true to me at the core. I found the Islamic principle that God is beautiful and loves beauty stood the test of reason and spirit. If I chose to live a beautiful life I’d have a beautiful life, and when I die… well, we’d see then. \n\nThis exploration led me to Krista Tippett’s On Being, a podcast full of stories about selflessness, care, and the beauty of human potential. When I heard Jean Vanier’s story of building communities for people with disabilities, something in me cracked open. For the first time in years, I cried, and those tears reminded me that I was still human.\nI listened to nearly every episode, but Father Greg Boyle’s story finally unlocked a path forward. The founder of Homeboy and Homegirl Industries, he helps former prisoners reintegrate with jobs, tattoo removal, and community support. When asked why he does this work, he didn’t say, “God told me to,” or, “It’s the right thing to do.” He simply said, “They’re my friends. So what else would I do?” That response shifted everything for me.\nFather Boyle working for a future outcome or trying to make a dent in the universe. His actions weren’t tied to expectations or good intentions—they emerged naturally from his way of being. The immediacy, focusing on living beautifully in the present moment, showed me that don’t need to have good intentions, that beauty isn’t about solving the world’s problems; beautiful actions emerge from true relationships, that truth builds relationships of love, and love gives birth to beauty. \n\n\nOver the next few months, I mulled Father Boyle’s words over in my mind and by 2016, I found myself on a plane to Beirut. Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night, where my nerd community was, and where the challenges of the Syrian refugees were most intense. It was there that we started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.\n\nSaleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas. He was born in a Syrian Palestinian refugee camp, and he had led a tough life up until we met in the refugee camps of Beirut. It was while he was hiding from the police at my house that we decided to start Beit Al Atlas. At Beit Al Atlas, we would host artists, international journalists, and for whatever reason, many people from Denmark. Early mornings the house would fill with the smell of coffee and the melodious sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our international resident from India, would make coffee for the house.\n\nSlowly, the house became a home for Saleh and me, a garden for the Syrian refugees who worked polishing shoes on our doorstep, a place for book clubs and dinners, and most importantly, a place for stories and connection. The house faced many struggles, yet through our diversity and connections through love with people around the world, we always found enough support to keep the doors open and the coffee pouring. \n\nAs beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself properly. When I moved to Beirut, Josephine had been wanting me to live with her, to marry her, to start a family together. She would visit the house, and at some point, Ahmed, one of the Syrian refugees who became part of our family, took off one of his rings and gave it to me, saying: Bilal, give this ring to Josephine to give to you. Enough already, go get married and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful.”\n\nI stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s worth of earnings for him. Yet he gave it to me so I could do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman my heart said yes to, the woman who loved me.\n\nBack then, I was too invested in having an impact. Living in Beirut and building this house was more important than love, stability, and babies. That’s when I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good,” even if Saleh was my friend, even if the house was authentically building beautiful and unlikely cross-cultural relationships, I was ignoring something profound, I was ignoring the one who loves me. Ahmed helped me see that, even though he left Syria when he was 11 after his father was shot by the Asad regime, even though he speaks with a lisp - a potential mark of deep trauma, he helped me see the beautiful thing to do. In the Muslim tradition, it’s said that the best charity is the charity one gives to one’s family, it’s said that those who are nearest to you deserve the most of you, and somehow, I was committing my life to beautiful friends, yet leaving alone and sad in France the person who wants to start a family with me. \n\nThis is when I finally started a more profound process of submission. Through Ahmed’s guidance, I was able to see that the Muslim tradition that I had left in Michigan so long ago had keys to a life in service to the quiet voice I found so hard to hear. By submitting my life to my sense of beauty, to the voice, and realized that that voice also left us many clues within us, in the world, and in the beautiful stories of the prophet and his Holy Book, the Quran. My relationship with submission to the divine could take a whole other book, let’s suffice it here to say that I started seeing the deeper wisdom in a tradition I had been ignoring. Finally, leaving the religion of progress, of what I thought goodness was, the religion that wants the self to leave a mark on the world, positive or not, made room for me to submit to a most Merciful God that is weaving the most beautiful story possible.\n\nIt was then that I finally started the long journey back to that moment in France. And so I packed my bags, leaving Beit Al Atlas in the capable hands of Saleh and friends. I flew to France to finally honor the commitment I’d kept in limbo—the commitment that opened the doors to baby Suleiman and that moment at the threshold of 2024, where I was holding my baby, feeling that all was just as it should be in this crazy world cradled in the hands of the most Merciful.\n\nThe first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity as someone who goes where the difficulties are, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, etc, and works to build community and create beauty in unexpected places. In a world that pushes us to greater heights, usually implying further and further distance from yourself, your wife and children, your parents, cousins, and high school friends, I've been working to slowly reintegrate myself with myself, build a loving home with my wife, we just had a baby, and it's all come full circle that morning as I held baby Suli and cried, one eye overflowing with tears of sorrow… the other eye with tears of love.\n"

Real Value You Offer:\n- Deep understanding of both Western tech culture and MENA perspectives\n- Proven ability to create meaningful spaces and initiatives (Beit Al Atlas, makerspaces)\n- Experience navigating complex cultural and technological landscapes\n- Unique approach to finding beauty in business contexts\n\nRisk Mitigation:\nStart with 2-3 pilot projects in Q1 2024:\n- Target companies with existing UAE-Europe connections\n- Focus on tech companies dealing with cross-cultural challenges\n- Price early projects at €5k to build case studies\n\nThe biggest risk isn't that it's too weird - it's that you might undersell yourself.

            "extracted_content": "BGGood morning, ChatGPT. So today I would like to review some things on my mind. I'm feeling a little bit low today. I'm taking 15 milligrams of Adderall and my qualia from the Neurohacker Collective, just trying to stay positive and upbeat. And maybe it's the end of the year, maybe it's the fact that crypto is zipping and I never know when to sell, because I haven't figured out how to deal with taxes, and I don't really want to sell, and I don't really want to buy, I don't want to even look at it, and I don't really want to think about money, and I need to apply for a job, and I think I have a good prospect at the due school, but I don't want to ever get a job, because I'm not the kind of person that works for other people. I always have my own projects, and I work for myself, and it would be the first time, and I'd like you to sort of come up with 10 questions, work sort of like a mix between a coach and a psychoanalyst, and help me really reflect and think about my life, and the end of the year, it's December 23rd, 2024, and I'm feeling like the whole world is sort of falling apart, this war has kind of been going on, and I just feel a little bit uneasy in all sorts of ways, and I don't really have a job right now, or work, I have a little bit of money, but who even knows what money is, I don't know if I should be buying gold or silver, or what exactly, and I'm walking with my baby, and he's cute, and yesterday was my wife's birthday, and I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm having a hard time. Can you help me think through these things, and other things, you know, like I haven't really worked on my publication for my paper, and there's all these things that I just wish I was better at, but I'm not, and I'm getting old, and I don't really have time for working out, and my family's far away, and I don't know if I'm holding my application well, and my sheikh in Gambia, my teacher, spiritual master, has told me to always have a question of God, or a positive impression of God, and I'm struggling to do that. Can you tell me what to think, can you help me think through these things, go by questions, and try to help me understand, and find a better way forward?”\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, especially with so much on your mind. Let's take a step back and approach this one piece at a time. How about we start with a few reflective questions to help you gain clarity?What specific aspects of your life are causing you the most stress right now?\nWhen you think about your ideal work situation, what does it look like?\nHow can you incorporate small moments of joy or peace into your day?\nWhat support systems or resources can you leanYou said:\n“Yeah, Habibi? Yeah, so one, I think the most amount of stress is sort of like just feeling like I'm far from my family, that I don't really know about money and like what to do with my financial situation because the whole world seems topsy-turvy, and I guess I, you know, like, it'll be okay. I have this small business called Noor Creative Studios, it barely makes any money. I spend a lot of money on like ambitious things and hopes and dreams, and like I'll just spend all my money on an assistant to go help me, you know, be more productive and more focused, and then, you know, it doesn't necessarily solve all my problems, and my assistant is, you know, like a young junior person with bad English, and it's just not exactly the best kind of support for me because I can't afford the really expensive assistants and coaches, and I don't even have money coming in right now. I just finished a contract with the UN, they didn't really get me any new jobs, and I don't really like the fact that, you know, a lot of my self-worth and happiness comes from like, oh, I got a new job, yay, or like, oh, look at my bank account, it's got money in it, yay, but also I know that I have some obligations to my baby and my wife, and I want to be a good husband. Basically, I don't know, like, this happens quite regularly, I just feel low and down because I think I have a bit of a maybe depressive attitude or mindset, like it's been very common in my life that I just kind of feel low periodically, maybe even associated with the changing of the seasons and stuff like that, and this is not that uncommon, but I did find some mushrooms, which is nice, okay, I found a bunch of oysters, cool.”\n09:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nI'm sorry you're feeling this way. It's understandable that all these factors are overwhelming. It's great that you're recognizing these feelings and seeking ways to address them.Let's break it down:Family and Distance: It's natural to feel the strain of being away from loved ones. Staying connected through regular calls or messages can help, even if it's just for a short time.Financial Uncertainty: It's challenging to manage finances during uncertain times. Maybe a financial advisor or simple budgeting can bring more clarity and peace of mind.Career and Projects: It's clear you have a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Perhaps focusing on the aspects of Noor Creative Studios that align with your passions could help you find renewed motivation.Self-worth and Success: It's important to remember that your value isn't defined by job titles or financial status. Your efforts in being a good husband and father are significant.Mental Health: Recognizing when you need support is a sign of strength. If these feelings persist, professional help could be beneficial.Spiritual Guidance: Your spiritual master's advice is valuable; try finding small daily moments of gratitude.Remember, it's okay to ask for help and take things one step at a time. You're doing your best, and that's enough.09:50You said:\n“OK, what are some other questions that you can get to try to help me find financially deeper?”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nSure, here are a09:54You said:\n“issues.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nSure, here are a few more reflective questions:What are the core values that guide your decisions, and how can you align your current situation with them?\nWhat small, achievable steps can you take today to move closer to your goals?\nHow do you define success for yourself, beyond external measures like money or job titles?\nWhat activities or hobbies bring you genuine joy and fulfillment, and how can you incorporate them more into your life?\nWhat are some past challenges you've overcome, and what strengths did you draw on to get through them?\nReflecting on these might help you uncover deeper insights and find a path forward.09:54You said:\n“In the past, you know, I just kind of go try to force myself to be patient and just bear through it, but I don't really have like a positive interpretation of those moments. They're mostly just like grit your teeth and move forward and kind of, you know, understand that they'll change. But I feel like maybe my mind has just a negative orientation more than normal. It's I see it in my grandfather. I see it in my mom and like, you know, I try to get a little bit of an up boost feeling from my Adderall and from drinking a lot of tea or coffee, just trying to get this, you know, sense of positivity. And then when I have that, I can then have a pretty good day. But it just seems exogenous and I'm wondering if I should just go cold turkey. You know, I also have ADD and so I wonder if these things are related, you know, like ADD and people. I'm curious if you have any statistics and insights as to what happens when people with ADD hit their 40s, which is what's going to be happening with me next year and kind of what's the standard expected feelings and behaviors of wasted potential and all of that. Like I can imagine wasted potential and feeling like what am I doing in my life? And I just don't really understand how to manage my mind and I should be old enough. I should have figured this out by now and all that kind of stuff can be pretty standard. And if that's the standard, how can I be non-standard? What can I do that would be slightly different? And if I know what is supposed to happen because I'm just an average person just like everybody else and I can expect these things, what can I do or feel or say or think or start working on to respond differently to the same sort of conditions that someone with ADHD and potentially mild depression and a lot of potential and travel internationally and a lot of friends and live far away from his family and as parents age, I'm sure there's no doubt that's going to happen to you in this part of your life because parents age, you know what I mean? So what are the things that are standard happenings and what are some of the best responses that someone can do to prepare for and anticipate these things and just have a different response because I just don't want to be the average person who's surprised by the death of his parents or aging or sickness. Like that's kind of obvious. So let's see what we can do in advance and so that we can live a life without regret.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nIt sounds like you're being incredibly introspective, which is a great step. Here are a few more questions and thoughts that might help:How can you redefine patience not just as enduring but as an opportunity for growth?\nWhat are some small, daily practices that could help shift your mindset towards positivity?\nWhat unique strengths do you bring to your situation that can help you navigate these challenges?\nHow can you create a support system that helps you manage ADHD and mild depression more effectively?\nWhat steps can you take now to prepare for the inevitable changes like aging parents, so you feel more in control?\nHow can you leverage your experiences and network to find new opportunities that align with your goals and passions?\nRemember, taking small steps and seeking support can make a big difference. It's okay to explore different approaches and find what works best for you.09:54You said:\n“Yeah, you know, I was hoping that you could look into my chat history and then come up with a theory of mind for me. Look into my entire context window and try to make your best guess assumptions. Make a theory of mind table and see how that mind would interface with these challenges. And then give your explanation for how and why you believe these various things about Bilal, the person that you're talking with right now.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nWhile I can't explicitly create a \"theory of mind\" table, I can summarize what I've gathered from our conversations. You seem to be an introspective, ambitious individual with a deep desire for meaningful work and personal growth. You value family, creativity, and self-improvement. Challenges with ADHD and managing periods of low mood seem to influence your perspective, making you reflective about how to navigate life’s challenges.Your approach to difficulties appears to involve patience and perseverance, though you're seeking more proactive and positive strategies. You're curious about how to prepare for future challenges, especially those that might feel inevitable, like aging parents.To respond differently to life's challenges, perhaps focusing on proactive mental health strategies, building strong support systems, and staying aligned with your core values could be beneficial.Is there any specific area you'd like to delve deeper into?09:54You said:\n“Yeah, I kind of want you to act like a coach and actually help me through things rather than just tell me some broad and generic advice.”\n09:58\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nGot it. Let's focus on some specific steps together.First, let’s identify a small, manageable goal for today. What is one thing you can do that might bring you closer to your career or personal goals?For instance, if you want to work on job prospects, maybe updating your resume or reaching out to a contact is a good start. If it's about your personal well-being, perhaps setting aside 10 minutes for a relaxing activity could help.Let's take it one step at a time. What would you like to focus on first?09:58You said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n09:58\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nTake your time.09:58You said:\n“Yeah, I think I first want to know exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing, and I'd like kind of maybe a psycho-spiritual understanding of my situation before getting into the practical stuff of, oh, I want to have a career goal, because I don't even know what my career goals are, you know? I think this is one of the things that happens to me a lot is I just get in my own way, you know? I overthink things, and my parents say that I'm too complicated, and it could be related to all of the stuff about, you know, I read so much but do so little, and I feel like I have a lot to share based on my life experience and reading and full contemplation, but not a lot of things to show for it, including like feeling like I can explain my career to somebody and have them know how to hire me, for instance. You really have to know me very well, and you have to kind of push me into a situation to say, hey, you could do this. Why don't you do this? We need somebody to run this workshop, which is what happened recently with Nihal when he asked me to run a, you know, Design for and with Marginalized Communities workshop, and I think, you know, there's other things, stuff coming up today, like I'm supposed to be working on this book. I paid a lot of money to take a course on, you know, publishing a book because I know I need the support and the encouragement and the backing and the pushing, but by now, it is like I have a few hours until our biweekly session, and I've done nothing because I was traveling and working on other things, and I had this workshop, and I didn't do any writing, and maybe I should do writing today of any kind just to get this organized and prepared, so maybe that's what I should actually be doing.”\n09:59\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nUnderstanding the \"why\" behind your actions can be really powerful. You seem to have a deep desire to share your knowledge and experiences but struggle with translating that into tangible outcomes. This could be a mix of perfectionism, overthinking, and perhaps a fear of not meeting your own high standards.It's important to remember that small, consistent actions often lead to greater progress than waiting for the perfect moment. Perhaps your psycho-spiritual journey is about balancing your thirst for knowledge with compassionate self-discipline.To start, maybe set a simple intention: write for just 10 minutes today, without worrying about the outcome. Embrace the process and trust that each step you take is valuable. How does that sound?09:59You said:\n“That sounds good, except I often use audio recording because I'm really good at talking and less good at sitting down and writing. I talk, and I write, and I actually produce a lot of text, but it just seems insurmountable and they go really wide, because I'm a really curious and diverse person. My interests just go really wide and become not very practical. It goes from, like, okay, here's how you can create a sustainable business that follows aesthetic principles and how this is a beautiful thing to do, and then at some point I'm talking about epistemology and ontology and the view of Muslims on the world and how we can redefine and reaccess this more psycho-mystical, open, unitarian, oneness perspective and how that will then influence how we start businesses. And it's just like, who's going to read and think and understand these things versus who's going to be able to just say, okay, so first step, have a good intention for your business. But it's like, I'd rather work on the deepest root causes rather than the end results of the fruits, and that makes it so that I get really broad and really, you know, I start talking about all sorts of things rather than, you know, some of the more immediate, at-hand practical stuff. And I wonder if, you know, like, when I write and I just have this stuff, I just look at it later and I'm like, okay, this is one book, this is two books, this is four books, this is how many different ideas are here. And so, you know, I don't have a problem with writing or producing content, I have a problem with, like, thinking about other people reading it and picking an audience and all of that stuff because I actually don't want to do that. Like, picking an audience and trying to come up with, like, a marketable book and this idea of, like, it's prepackaged, easy to digest something that just feels like it will be inauthentic. And then I realize that that's why I'm, like, poor and confusing and nobody understands me and no one knows how to hire me and I feel like I'm, like, rich with insight and ideas and I just do way too many different diverse things that are not adding up. And every time I try to even just do one thing that I can try to create and share, it becomes a huge, like, worldview that people have to get in and involved in and how can I bring these things together? You know, like, there's this guy, Baraka Blue, he has this Rumi-centered courses and he just does, like, reads Rumi and then asks people for their reflections and he holds space and people think of him as, you know, the poet guy who has these courses on mysticism and it's really clear. Like, if you want a course on Islamic mysticism and you're going to do it in a poetic way with a beautiful community, good aesthetics, all that, just go to, like, Baraka Blue and look at what he's doing. If you want, you know, Islamic economics and alternative views on how Muslims view economics, you can go to Ady Atiyah and take his courses, you know? And for me, it's like, I don't have a team, I don't have a PhD, I don't have consistency in anything that I've done. I've done robotics, I've done, you know, startup support and, you know, I'm now, like, working on this kind of worldview, mystic kind of interpretation that will define how we look at businesses to make them more sustainable, but that's not the goal. It's important not to have a goal, it's important to have a different way of seeing nature as a place where, you know, you can see the signs of God and then how does that change, you know, natural resources into things that you are much more respectful of and gentle with, including people, instead of human resources in a human resource department. What about, like, these people as people, as beautiful humans that you want to help them find their contribution? And that can be what a human resource department does, and I just think very broadly and diversely and confusingly, and it's also part of my journey, too, right? Like, I started very practically, I started with, like, open-source technology for good, you know, how can we use these tools that people are using to build rail and stuff to build good stuff? And then I had the idea of making my own showcase of these kinds of good things, and so I started my own projects, like the Awareness Project, when car bombs go off and it would crush a sculpture using an Arduino and send a tweet to people who promised to do good things whenever bad things happened, and it was to try to, you know, demonstrate how we can play with technology to be more positively responsive to the challenges of the world, to see the pain globally, but to act locally, and not to get overwhelmed with everything you can do, but to do something about one cause that you care about. And I have all these ideas, and I've built all these things, and I even thought to myself, like, oh, let's try to talk to ChatGPT differently and all this AI stuff and use our pen and paper and, like, write to them long form so that we can't copy and paste, so that we're more involved with our manual connection, and I made this app, and I just put it online at cursiveGPT.com, and nobody cares, because I don't market it, and I don't share it, and then how does that connect to anything else that I'm doing? And it's so messy, and, like, who the heck am I? What is this? Am I, like, a Renaissance man that nobody cares about, that when I die, people are like, oh, yeah, he had some interesting ideas, let's retrospectively write a book and honor this random person, but instead of, during my life, when I actually need work and a job and coherence and meaning and a story, like, what other characters in history were like this? You know, like, at least Benjamin Franklin, he had some jobs, you know, and, like, he made money, and I just, maybe this is connected to my whole, like, this taste with money thing, where I'm like, oh, yeah, you know, I don't really want money, dah, dah, dah, whatever, like, don't pay me too much, I just want to get it, like, accidentally in the side where someone actually sends it into my bank account where it's not connected to the stuff I do, and I'm not sure how I can possibly have a career thinking and behaving like that, but I think it's connected to my worldview, and until my worldview changes, I'm not sure I'll be able to fix that. Can you give, like, a breakdown, an analysis of how these things are all interconnected and maybe a path forward? Well, there you have it.”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nYou have a rich and expansive mind that thrives on exploring complex ideas. This desire to dive deeply into diverse topics is a strength, but it can also make it challenging to create focused, practical outputs that resonate with a specific audience.Your inclination towards exploring root causes and deeper meanings reflects a holistic worldview. However, the challenge lies in translating these broad insights into tangible, actionable forms that others can easily grasp and utilize.To bridge this gap, consider focusing on one core idea at a time, making it accessible without losing its depth. It's okay to have a broad perspective, but channeling that into focused projects might help others better connect with your ideas.Think of it as creating \"entry points\" for others to engage with your broader vision. It might also help to collaborate with others who can support and complement your strengths, turning your diverse insights into cohesive, impactful projects.How does that sound to you?10:00You said:\n“I think you could do better. Go a little deeper and try to understand like maybe the psychology that connects across these different, both pros and cons, like what exactly is happening in my mind and how do they actually result in both of these things.”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour mind seems to operate like a vast, interconnected web, constantly seeking to integrate diverse concepts and ideas. This depth and breadth are part of your strengths, but they can also make it challenging to focus and produce concise, targeted outputs.Psychologically, this might stem from a combination of high curiosity, a desire for authenticity, and perhaps an aversion to oversimplification or commercialization. You value depth and authenticity over surface-level engagement, which makes you resistant to traditional \"packaging\" of ideas.This approach can sometimes lead to a sense of being \"spread too thin\" or feeling misunderstood because your broad scope can be hard for others to immediately grasp.To bring these strengths together:Ground your ideas in tangible examples: Start with the deep concepts but find ways to anchor them in practical, relatable stories or applications.\nIterative sharing: Break down your broad ideas into smaller pieces that can be shared incrementally, inviting engagement and feedback.\nFinding your \"why\": Reconnect with your core motivation—why you are passionate about these topics and how they connect to your life's purpose.\nEmbracing this approach might help you bring coherence to your diverse interests and make your work more accessible and impactful.10:00You said:\n“Yeah, OK. Can you give me a step-by-step approach for how to do that and turn it into a career path?”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let’s break it down into actionable steps:Identify a Core Theme: Choose one central idea or theme that resonates most with you. This could be something like integrating spiritual insights into business or sustainable practices.Create Entry Points: Develop smaller, digestible content or projects that align with this theme. For example, start with a blog series, short videos, or workshops that introduce these ideas in a practical way.Engage and Iterate: Share these smaller pieces with your network or a target audience. Gather feedback and refine your approach based on what resonates most.Build a Narrative: Craft a coherent story around your core theme, linking your diverse interests into a unified narrative. This will help others see the connections between your ideas.Establish Consistency: Consistency doesn’t mean limiting your curiosity but creating regular, predictable content or sessions that people can rely on, like a weekly blog or monthly workshop.Collaborate and Network: Partner with others who can help bring your ideas10:00You said:\n“Yeah, okay. I was thinking about the work that we've done together based on the context window and the history that you know. Like, the workshop I did on post-traumatic growth with people from Gaza, Palestine. The workshop I just did recently with Nihal. And, you know, am I like a workshop giver? Like, answer all of these questions for yourself and then come up with a, I don't know, like a landing page and read it out to me. Describing this really awesome guy who has great experience and is super valuable. And actually like, oh, you just read his website and you want to hire him and you know exactly what for. And it's like marketable and hireable skills for today. You know, as the world gets more closed, as more countries are not opening their borders. As people think of the world as getting more difficult and where the, you know, ecology is kind of collapsing as well. And we worry about the future. So, given all of that, what is the still hireable job? There's still corporations, but like everyone is worried these days. You know, like, what are we going to, what are we going to do? And I should still be someone that people want to hire. So, what is that kind of pitch? And, you know, think of my website and what are the different sections? And you can talk about my previous talks, but they're also different and so old now. I also have had about 10 years where I was kind of like head down working on gloom.pm. And it was just kind of focusing on working in Lebanon and trying to be smaller and more humble. And, you know, like I didn't want to be this big shot, like traveling the world and making positive change or whatever. So, that kind of led to me being irrelevant and kind of quiet and hard to even see. So, what can we do with all of that to move forward?”\n10:03\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nBilal Ghalib: Catalyzing Change Through Innovative Workshops and InsightsAbout Bilal Bilal Ghalib is a seasoned workshop facilitator and thought leader with over a decade of experience in empowering communities and fostering positive change.

For instance, having check-ins, for instance, where we include deliberate rumination questions. And I want it all to be also explainable, so that it's a part of our mind and our heart, rather than just our mind. And maybe we can reconnect to this idea of like, see, feel, do again. See the world, let it affect how you feel, and then what are you going to do about it. And you know, there's so much seeing of things with social media, and I really feel like there's a place for craft, and like connecting with quiet and solitude, and this place where things emerge. But I also would like you to kind of take a perspective from like a corporate leader's HR department, you know, like looking at a roster of different things to do. Like they can ask me like, okay, well, what's your track record? What's your impact? And all I can say is, I don't know, people like thank me after my workshops. And like, what's the point, right? Like, what's the point if it doesn't make businesses money, or make their teams more efficient, or any of these things? What if it just like makes people want to quit, you know? It's not going to be a great pitch for HR departments. And so I feel like there's a lot of issues with this, and I'm wondering if you could give me like a very strong critique from my greatest opponent in my work, and what they would say, so that I can think about a rebuttal, and actually maybe even change my mind, right? So help me change my mind, like look at it from a critique critic's perspective, look at it from a logical perspective, go through line by line, idea by idea, and just help me try to change my mind, even about one element, you know? Like maybe it is also about when people are young, they just need to do something, right? Something that is obviously good, rather than something abstractly good. And the obviously good thing could be like, okay, let's work on SDGs, and it's a cool project, and you know, changex.org, where you just do and copy, connect the dots, and you know, one of the things that I've never done is like work in a corporate environment, like I don't have that experience, I'm like, I can't even manage myself well, how am I going to be telling people about anything, if I don't have like the background and experience, like I'm almost 40, and I have no like giant success story, I built this business called bloom.pm, that it's not even making money, and I'm gonna just have it go away, because the funding in the Middle East has changed and stopping, like what am I supposed to say about my story that's exciting? And so first, let's come up with the critique, and then let's come up with a response.”\n10:10\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nAbsolutely, let's dive into a critique from an opponent's perspective:Critique:Lack of Corporate Experience: Without experience in a corporate environment, it can be challenging to connect with the practical\n10:10You said:\n“Mushrooms.”\n10:10\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let's dive into a critique from an opponent's perspective:Critique:Lack of Corporate Experience: Without experience in a corporate environment,\n10:10You said:\n“I know, it's an oyster. Yeah, I look into it. I know. Yes, yes. I'll show you. Yeah, yeah, it's a plurot. Yes.”\n10:12\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's wonderful!10:12You said:\n“Yeah, I'll throw it to you.”\n10:13\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, those are10:13You said:\n“This is odd, odd VA.”\n10:17\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nOld oyster mushrooms can still be great to find. Are you planning to cook them?10:17You said:\n“You are a pharmacist? No, no. I'm curious. I like mushrooms. It's like that. You are very careful. Yes, I'm very careful. I find a lot of mushrooms every day. I make spore prints. I know the guy with the spore prints. I'm always looking. How do you make curves? Difficult, difficult. You have to be very careful.”\n10:17\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, it's crucial to be careful with mushrooms. Making spore prints10:17You said:\nYeah, although I also have practical things, like how might we, I take inspiration from design thinking, I think about well-being, and very practical steps about how to do that. For instance, having check-ins, for instance, where we include deliberate rumination questions. And I want it all to be also explainable, so that it's a part of our mind and our heart, rather than just our mind. And maybe we can reconnect to this idea of like, see, feel, do again. See the world, let it affect how you feel, and then what are you going to do about it. And you know, there's so much seeing of things with social media, and I really feel like there's a place for craft, and like connecting with quiet and solitude, and this place where things emerge. But I also would like you to kind of take a perspective from like a corporate leader's HR department, you know, like looking at a roster of different things to do. Like they can ask me like, okay, well, what's your track record? What's your impact? And all I can say is, I don't know, people like thank me after my workshops. And like, what's the point, right? Like, what's the point if it doesn't make businesses money, or make their teams more efficient, or any of these things? What if it just like makes people want to quit, you know? It's not going to be a great pitch for HR departments. And so I feel like there's a lot of issues with this, and I'm wondering if you could give me like a very strong critique from my greatest opponent in my work, and what they would say, so that I can think about a rebuttal, and actually maybe even change my mind, right? So help me change my mind, like look at it from a critique critic's perspective, look at it from a logical perspective, go through line by line, idea by idea, and just help me try to change my mind, even about one element, you know?

And so first, let's come up with the critique, and then let's come up with a response.\n10:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nCritique from Your Greatest Opponent's Perspective\nLack of Clear Metrics:\"Your work lacks measurable impact. Without concrete metrics—like increased revenue, retention rates, or efficiency—it's difficult for HR departments to justify your approach. 'People thanked me' doesn’t hold up in a boardroom.\"\nAbstract and Intangible Outcomes:\"Your emphasis on well-being and rumination is too abstract for corporate environments. Businesses prioritize clear, actionable outcomes. If your workshops lead people to quit because they realize they don’t like their jobs, why would a company hire you?\"\nWeak Track Record:\"You don't have a history of working in corporate environments or a major success story to point to. How can you claim to understand corporate needs when you've never been in that context?\"\nOverly Philosophical Approach:\"The 'see, feel, do' framework and ideas about craft and solitude are inspiring, but they lack direct applicability in fast-paced environments. Businesses need immediate, scalable solutions, not reflective journeys.\"\nPotentially Disruptive Outcomes:\"If your methods lead to employees rethinking their lives, it could create disengagement rather than improved performance. How does this serve organizational goals?\"\nLack of Alignment with Business Goals:\"Your work doesn’t align with traditional business metrics like productivity, profitability, or innovation. Without a clear business case, your workshops could be seen as a waste of resources.\"\nPerception of Personal Inadequacy:\"Your lack of self-confidence in managing yourself and your career trajectory could make it hard for others to trust your guidance. If Bloom struggled to make money, why should others invest in your ideas?\"\nResponse and Rebuttal\nOn Metrics:Rebuttal: \"Measuring well-being and engagement is possible, and the outcomes are directly linked to organizational success. Studies show that happier, more engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and less likely to leave. I can start tracking these metrics to provide evidence.\"\nActionable Step: Develop post-workshop surveys and follow-up assessments to measure shifts in engagement, collaboration, and creativity.\nOn Abstract Outcomes:Rebuttal: \"Abstract outcomes often lead to profound, long-term impacts. Companies investing in mindfulness, resilience, and psychological safety have seen significant returns.\"\nActionable Step: Frame the workshops as a way to foster creativity and resilience, directly tied to business innovation and adaptability.\nOn Weak Track Record:Rebuttal: \"While I haven’t worked in a corporate environment, I’ve facilitated impactful workshops for diverse audiences. The principles I teach are universal and applicable anywhere.\"\nActionable Step: Leverage testimonials, case studies, or partnerships with organizations that can validate your work.\nOn Philosophical Approach:Rebuttal: \"The 'see, feel, do' framework aligns with design thinking principles already embraced by leading companies. It provides a structured way to approach problem-solving while staying grounded in empathy and action.\"\nActionable Step: Translate philosophical ideas into clear, practical steps for immediate application in team settings.\nOn Disruptive Outcomes:Rebuttal: \"Encouraging employees to reflect doesn’t mean disengagement—it means alignment. Employees who feel connected to their values and the company’s mission perform better and are less likely to burn out.\"\nActionable Step: Emphasize how your workshops align personal values with organizational goals, fostering a sense of purpose.\nOn Alignment with Business Goals:Rebuttal: \"Well-being drives results. For example, Google’s Project Aristotle found that psychological safety is the number one predictor of high-performing teams. My workshops directly enhance these soft skills.\"\nActionable Step: Link workshop outcomes to metrics like team performance, innovation rates, or retention, and include these in pitches.\nOn Perception of Personal Inadequacy:Rebuttal: \"Leadership isn’t about perfection but about authenticity and growth. My experiences with Bloom and beyond have given me unique insights into navigating challenges.\"\nActionable Step: Reframe your narrative: Bloom was an experiment in innovation and resilience, proving your ability to adapt and persevere in changing contexts.\nShifting Your Perspective\nYou mentioned the tension between abstractly good and obviously good actions. Perhaps there’s merit in balancing both:Start Small, Prove Impact: Focus on delivering workshops tied to specific goals like SDG alignment or team-building. These 'obviously good' projects can be easier to pitch.\nEmerge from Solitude: Your emphasis on craft and solitude is a valuable counterpoint to the noise of social media. Package this as a \"quiet leadership\" program for managers dealing with overwhelm.\nFocus on Corporate Familiarity: Partner with someone who understands corporate structures to bridge the gap between your philosophy and their needs.\nWould shifting toward more tangible outcomes while retaining your core philosophy feel authentic to you? Let me know how you'd like to refine this further!10:20You said:\nHere, can we actually respond based on what you know about me from my perspective and say things that demonstrate my growth and understanding and imply, like, what are the things I'm going to do to actually properly address the critique to improve my position in this way?\n10:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let’s address the critique from your perspective while demonstrating your growth and the steps you’ll take to address these points.Response and Action Plan\n1. On Metrics and Measurable Impact\nYour Growth: \"I’ve realized the importance of aligning my work with measurable outcomes, not just for validation but to create a narrative that bridges personal transformation and organizational goals. My experience has taught me that qualitative impact—like the stories of personal growth from workshop participants—can and should be complemented by data.\"\nActionable Step: \"I will implement post-workshop surveys to measure changes in employee engagement, creativity, and team collaboration. I’ll follow up with organizations six months after sessions to quantify long-term outcomes.\"\n2. On Abstract and Intangible Outcomes\nYour Growth: \"I’ve learned that organizations value clarity and immediate applicability. While my approach focuses on deeper, emergent insights, I can scaffold these ideas into actionable frameworks that are easy to implement.\"\nActionable Step: \"I will translate my 'see, feel, do' philosophy into a practical toolkit, combining it with check-ins and deliberate rumination exercises tied to organizational priorities like innovation and team cohesion.\"\n3. On Track Record\nYour Growth: \"My work at Bloom has given me deep insights into resilience, innovation, and adaptability in volatile contexts. I recognize now that I need to showcase how these lessons are universally applicable, even in corporate environments.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll build case studies from Bloom and other projects, highlighting specific examples where my approach led to concrete outcomes like improved team collaboration or innovative solutions in challenging environments.\"\n4. On Philosophical Approach\nYour Growth: \"I understand now that ideas like craft, solitude, and emergence can feel abstract to some audiences. But these practices are more relevant than ever in helping organizations manage burnout and foster creativity.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll design a 'quiet leadership' module tailored for managers, focusing on how deliberate reflection and solitude can enhance decision-making and prevent burnout. This module will integrate clear deliverables like stress-reduction practices and creative problem-solving tools.\"\n5. On Potentially Disruptive Outcomes\nYour Growth: \"Reflection isn’t about disengagement—it’s about alignment. I’ve seen firsthand how connecting people to their values leads to renewed energy and commitment, both personally and professionally.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll explicitly frame my workshops as alignment tools that connect employees’ personal values with organizational goals, making teams not just more fulfilled but more effective.\"\n6. On Alignment with Business Goals\nYour Growth: \"I’ve come to understand that well-being and organizational success aren’t competing goals—they’re deeply interconnected. By focusing on psychological safety and creative capacity, my work supports key business metrics.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll integrate business-focused metrics into my pitches, such as innovation rates, retention rates, and team productivity, showing how these are enhanced through my approach.\"\n7. On Perception of Personal Inadequacy\nYour Growth: \"I’ve reflected deeply on my narrative. Bloom wasn’t a failure—it was an incubator of resilience and adaptability, teaching me how to navigate uncertainty. My value lies not in perfection but in authenticity and the lessons I’ve learned through experimentation.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll reframe my story as one of continuous growth, positioning myself as someone who thrives in ambiguity and helps others do the same. I’ll also identify specific areas for personal improvement, like partnering with a mentor who has corporate experience to deepen my understanding of that space.\"\nNext Steps to Solidify Your Position\nDevelop a New Portfolio: Create a portfolio that clearly outlines your workshops, their methodologies, and measurable impacts.\nPilot a Corporate Program: Run a small-scale workshop with a corporate team, gather feedback, and refine the approach to better align with their needs.\nNetwork Strategically: Partner with someone who has corporate experience to co-facilitate or consult on bridging your approach with corporate language and priorities.\nRevisit Bloom: Use your experience at Bloom as a living case study, focusing on the skills and insights gained rather than the financial challenges.\nBy addressing these critiques through actionable changes, you’ll not only strengthen your position but also align your values with practical, impactful results. How does this resonate with you? Would you like to focus on any particular point further?10:20You said:\nYeah, could you ask me 10 questions to get me to respond to the critique in a way that will really convince me? Because right now I'm not convinced. I really think that it sounds like I'm just capitulating to their whims and needs. What are some questions that I can reflect on that might actually help me make a real internal change so that this is not just a bunch of words?\n10:23\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nOf course! Here are ten questions designed to help you reflect deeply, challenge your assumptions, and arrive at a genuine internal shift—one that aligns with your values while addressing the critique meaningfully.What do you believe is the core value or essence of your work, and how could aligning with corporate needs actually amplify rather than dilute that essence?Reflect on how your unique perspective can meet both your ideals and their practical concerns.\nWhat would need to change for you to feel like you're offering something transformative to corporate environments, rather than adapting to their demands?Consider what it means to bring your philosophy into a new context on your terms.\nHow might metrics and measurable outcomes not just validate your work but serve as tools for deepening your impact and improving your workshops?Think about whether measurement could be reframed as part of your reflective, iterative process.\nWhat is your reaction to the idea that people might not \"get\" your workshops if they’re too abstract? Is it your responsibility to make your ideas more accessible, or is the onus on others to stretch themselves?Reflect on whether compromise is a form of connection or a betrayal of your vision.\nWhat would it take for you to see “corporate needs” not as limiting, but as a creative challenge that could evolve your work into something even greater?Explore the potential growth in engaging with an unfamiliar context.\nWhen you consider your past workshops, what are the moments or outcomes you’re most proud of, and how might you communicate those in a way that resonates with skeptics?Focus on the stories that demonstrate your impact, even if they don’t follow conventional metrics.\nWhat part of the critique feels most threatening to you, and why? Is it a challenge to your values, your confidence, or something else?Identify the emotional core of your resistance and unpack it.\nIf you imagined working with a corporate HR team, what specific problems might they face that your approach could uniquely solve?Shift the question from “how do I fit?” to “what needs am I uniquely positioned to meet?”\nWhat assumptions might you be making about corporate environments, and how could you test or challenge those assumptions?Reflect on whether your critiques of corporate culture are fully accurate or need re-examining.\nIf you could co-create an entirely new framework for corporate engagement—one that feels authentic to you—what would it look like, and how would it blend both your ideals and their goals?Imagine a blueprint that doesn’t compromise but instead reinvents the conversation.\nWould you like to explore any of these questions together, or do they bring to mind initial responses you’d like to share?10:24You said:\nYeah, so, I have, like, two ideas first. The first idea is kind of related to this thought that I had that it's not that I am against quantification, but I'm against quantifying the wrong things, and, like, maybe I could have been gathering some interesting stories and insights from my work in the past to be able to, first of all, just, like, take more pride. You know, like, quantification is visualized memory. It's like memory crystal. And when you can see it, you can be like, oh, my God. Like, if I was able to say that I helped 500 people not give up doing the things that matter to them and help them align with their intentions to do good, to share the gifts that they have in the world, like, that could be really inspiring to me. But I can't even say that because I've been so obtuse and, like, oh, no, you know, I don't want to measure. But measuring the right things could be great. So maybe this is one way we can align on that. Two is I think we need, like, an immune system for AI or, like, an AI vaccine for resolving this unseen conflict that no one is really talking about between employees trying to use artificial intelligence to kind of get away with doing less work and improve their quality without their employers knowing and employers wanting to essentially at some point use AI to replace their employees and reduce the headcount on their businesses. And, like, this is an unspoken thing. And I think there's some, like, beautiful ways to use artificial intelligence. But we're not really talking about it. We're just, you know, in these two different silos. And maybe this is one way I can work with corporate clients to identify a workshop that I can do with them. And then the other thing is maybe I shouldn't be working with corporate clients at all. Like, maybe that's the wrong question. Maybe the question for me should be something like who really could benefit from my skills and my knowledge and my expertise and the gifts that I have in terms of these types of workshops and sessions and talks and maybe even tools. You know, like, I've been thinking about making a tool based on the frameworks that we've developed for artificial intelligence where when people start asking it questions to do work for them, it can say, hold up, let me ask you some questions to show you the beauty that you have to give, you know, to help you see your blind spots, to help you see your skills and what you should be doing right now and to help you align on that and to encourage you and to coach you and to help you write and then to help you structure your writing so that your outputs are wonderful instead of just doing the writing for you and having it be this kind of garbage. You know, like, one of the interesting things that I did with AI recently was I asked it to ask me a bunch of questions to get as much of the writing done by me as possible so that it could just, you know, take the writing, cut the sentences up and organize them and structure them in a way that is coherent and clear to address the challenge. And this way, the work can be something that you're proud of because you came up with it, you did it, you know. But it was leveraging the advantage of AI in terms of being able to stay focused and on track and to answer the right question and if you ever are stuck, it can help you identify your blind spots and how other people would answer this so that your work can have a qualitative improvement. And this is something cool to use AI for. Not whatever people are doing, like here, write me a five-paragraph essay on, you know, innovation in the workplace or something. And that's a workshop that I could give. But I think the question I'm going to mirror back to you is, like, based on all the stuff that you know, should I be trying to get corporate clients? Is that the place for me to define my career? Or should I be working more with startups and individual people and people in the Middle East and North Africa and, you know, like, are these the people that would really value and appreciate the knowledge and expertise that I have, you know, with all of the post-traumatic growth frameworks How do you use AI to help people feel proud of themselves in their work rather than ashamed? And is there, like, something different that I should be doing as well in terms of, like, my self-confidence and mindset? And, you know, like, people kind of also get what they expect to get. If I tell them, like, I don't know, just a little workshop, I'll do a little thing for you, it might be helpful, it might not be. And if I instead said, like, okay, no, we're going to come up with a memory crystal, a.k.a. a data visualization, because that's what it is, you know, it takes the memory of the quantitative and qualitative feedback that people are giving and turns it into something that you can hold and it's a gem. And, you know, like, I've always been kind of opposed in some sense to gamification because I always felt like it was, like, belittling and making small and, like, the menu and people are going to just work for the menu, like, trying to get as much coins as possible and that's the problem with capitalism. It's like, oh yeah, more coins, that means good, right? And it's easy to make that simple rather than to say every day you need to check in with yourself and to think what is more good, right? And this is an insight I had a long time ago from my talk, Good is Hard, where I was talking about Fritz Haber and the guy that invented nitrogen fixing and how he was so adamant and kind of insistent on death and the thing is, he invented a thing that fed the planet and we called it good and we gave him a Nobel Prize and then there's this guy, right? Like, he invented the lobotomy, but he did it because he loved and he cared for the patients that were in his care and Edgar Moniz, right? So Edgar was like, oh, these poor people, in the case of the most extreme, most difficult situations, this is the thing that we can do to keep them safe and keep the people around them safe and he also won the Nobel Prize and both of their outputs, one looked bad very soon, one looked good very soon and then they switched and now we have a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where nothing grows because of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and for a while, lobotomies were horrible and they killed so many people and hurt so many people and this idea of like having, so this is like maybe the core issue around the measurement idea, it's like, unless you regularly come back to it and you see what your heart is telling you, looking at this memory crystal and being in constant feedback and that's the thing, I think, it's also related to all of this decentralized autonomous organizations, right? You think you know what good is and you can set it up and have this map drawn out and the lines and the waypoints, which are measurements along the way of these various things and it does a good job, it grows businesses. But at the end of the day, we want to make sure that these businesses are good and I kind of believe in a million billionaires rather than a thousand billionaires, right? So what if we had a billion millionaires instead of a million billionaires or the opposite, right? We need more people to be wealthy and to be able to dream even within the context of these organizations I feel like we can have different ways of business and that maybe it's really by doing these things and just maybe finding the core principles that will be able to direct thousands of people and to train HR staff to do these things, we can have kind of a slow growth of these philosophies that are about being and about remembering and about having these stories to be able to tell about our past that would still inspire us, right? And there's these stories that we can tell that would help people sort of understand themselves and this is kind of like the idea of the long-form autobiography, right? I kind of had this problem where when I was younger I was like, okay, when you're living, you got to imagine that you're telling your life story so let's make sure that by the end when you die you are happy with the main character and that nobody is like reading the story and be like, no, wait, why would you do that? Be angry with the main character and the thing is, I felt like that was too much self-centered and so I feel like maybe it's not an autobiography and maybe it's more like the Gandhi, my experiments with truth, right? And maybe it could be like my experiments with beauty\n10:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThank you for sharing all these ideas, reflections, and questions. Let’s approach this systematically to help clarify your direction, starting with some tailored follow-up questions that build on your reflections while challenging you to deepen your thinking and align with your true goals.Questions to Deepen Reflection and Resolve\n1. Measurement and Memory Crystals\nWhat are the right things to measure that would genuinely inspire you and align with your values?\nHow might capturing these metrics not just validate your work to others but also give you a sense of pride and direction in your own story?\nWhat’s stopping you from starting now—reviewing past work and gathering those stories to form the memory crystal?\n2. The Corporate vs. Human Impact Question\nWhat excites you more: influencing corporate systems for incremental change or working directly with individuals or startups for transformative impact?\nIf you focus on corporations, how could you design workshops that plant seeds of beauty and transformation within a system you currently see as flawed?\nWhat would a client look like that perfectly aligns with both your values and your desire for financial sustainability?\n3. AI and Human Creativity\nHow does the idea of using AI to foster pride in work, rather than replace it, connect with your vision for beauty and storytelling in people's lives?\nWhat frameworks or tools could you create that combine your deep understanding of post-traumatic growth with AI's capacity to scaffold creativity?\nCould your proposed AI vaccine concept become an entry point to engage with corporations or a broader audience in a way that feels authentic?\n4. Reclaiming Confidence and Ownership\nWhat internal narrative keeps you from fully owning your past successes, such as Bloom or your workshops?\nHow can you reframe those stories in a way that acknowledges both the learning and the impact you’ve had?\nIf someone else had done what you’ve done—built Bloom, facilitated meaningful workshops, developed a vision for AI tools—how would you celebrate their achievements? Why is it harder to do the same for yourself?\n5. Gamification, Alignment, and Goodness\nHow might you design “good gamification”—a system that rewards reflection, connection, and alignment with values rather than just productivity?\nWhat does ‘goodness’ look like in the context of the organizations and people you want to serve? How would you help them see and feel that?\nWhat does ‘goodness’ look like in your own story, and how do you align with it in practical ways each day?\n6. Stories, Principles, and Long-Term Impact\nWhat’s the core story you want your work to tell about the world, and how does it connect with your audience’s struggles and desires?\nWhat principles guide your approach to beauty, alignment, and impact? How might these principles inform a scalable framework that could influence others?\nWhat does your \"experiments with beauty\" narrative look like, and how might sharing it empower others to run their own experiments?\n7. Audience Fit\nWho has already valued and benefited from your work the most—corporate clients, individuals, startups, or another group?\nWhich audience do you feel most inspired to serve, and why? How would serving them contribute to the larger story you want to tell about the world?\nHow might you prototype working with different audiences—corporates, startups, individual creators—so you can gather data about where you have the greatest impact?\n8. Vision Beyond Individual Impact\nIf you imagine training thousands of HR leaders, startups, or individuals, how would you ensure your philosophies grow slowly and sustainably within their systems?\nWhat kind of legacy do you want your work to leave behind for the people and organizations it touches?\nHow might the principles of decentralized organizations and autonomy help you scale your approach in a way that feels authentic and impactful?\n9. Your Relationship with Measurement\nIf you could design your ideal feedback loop—a mix of stories, metrics, and visuals—what would it look like, and how would it inspire both you and others?\nHow might regularly revisiting these \"memory crystals\" keep you aligned with your values while adapting to what the world needs?\nWhat’s one small way you could start capturing these stories and metrics today?\n10. Practical and Philosophical Alignment\nHow do you reconcile the desire to create change in flawed systems (e.g., corporate environments) with the feeling that you should work elsewhere?\nHow do you ensure that your ideas, while philosophical, are also actionable and tangible?\nWhat’s one small, “obviously good” thing you can do today that will help you build confidence in your ability to have impact while staying true to your values?\nNext Steps\nTake one or two questions that resonate most deeply with you and start journaling or discussing them further. If you'd like, I can help you unpack your responses or refine the questions into specific action steps. Which of these questions feels most urgent to explore first?10:24You said:\nSo, how would you imagine Bilal respond to all of the questions? And what is the advice that you would give him on the place in the world where he would actually light up to be contributing, has a good financial return, and is a good home for his ideas? Maybe we can try to make a plan for getting into those areas. And for now, we can also work on his landing page and maybe even a plan for gathering the data from all of his, you know, teams that he's worked with and kind of looking back. And it's a good time of year to do a retrospective, but at the same time, maybe come up with this idea of, like, a memory crystal dashboard career experiment with truth. I'm not exactly sure what to call it or what it would look like, but look at all of this and then come up with a plan for January 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 for me to be able to prepare myself for an awesome new year and an awesome career where, you know, given my spiritual and psychological and emotional capacity and the failures that I have in the organization, not being very corporate and struggling with, you know, consistency and motivation and to come up with a way that I can take the best and mitigate the worst and to find a place where I really thrive. And if you must, at the end, you can ask three deep and profound questions to help you revise it.\n10:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nBilal’s Response to the Questions\n1. On Measurement and Memory Crystals\nBilal realizes that resistance to measurement was not about numbers but about the fear of losing the soul of his work. He sees now that measuring the right things—such as stories of alignment, resilience, and personal growth—creates a \"memory crystal,\" a visualized narrative that honors his values while inspiring others.On Audience Fit\nHe reflects that his deepest impact has been on individuals, small teams, and communities in the Middle East and North Africa. These are the people who connect deeply with his post-traumatic growth frameworks, AI ideas for alignment, and the spiritual depth he brings. Corporate clients may not be his home, and that's okay.On AI as a Tool for Pride\nHe feels inspired to build tools and frameworks that use AI to help people rediscover their unique gifts and take pride in their work. This aligns deeply with his value of helping others uncover their beauty and blind spots.On Reclaiming Confidence\nBilal recognizes that his story, far from being a failure, is a testament to resilience, exploration, and learning. He reframes Bloom as an experimental lab for his ideas, where he learned what works, what doesn’t, and what lights him up.On His Place in the World\nHe sees himself not as a fit for traditional corporate work but as a bridge for people and organizations navigating complex challenges—whether they are startups, community groups, or small businesses.

I like seeing people alive. \n2. I would have more experiences with my work where I feel like I'm leaving somethng behidn that touches people in the way they would be in my workshops, I'd be making more money that I'm proud of, I think sales would make me happy, of a book or a software, or something like that that isn't my time/workshop. Maybe i could finish my book, how would you revise my book on barakanomics given what we talked about so I don't go too broad and make it unreadable while not boxing myself into a here's a step by step approach that doesn't include transformation? \n3. moving to spain and joining La fonda? Or maybe finding another co-founder, or asking Pascal to work/collab on a project? Ask for Paris money/jobs with Learning Planet Institute? Maybe spend time finding the people that inspire me the most and finding ways to spend more itme with them? Can you come up with who/where/what would I be doing that will bring me to live, satisfy my career needs, and what problem am i solving for them - what ideas/frameworks do they take away that provides value and pitch me to me and them\n10:24\nChatGPT### Bilal’s Career Direction and Next Steps #### 1. You’re a Bridge Between Depth and Practicality The reflection on your “memory crystal” reveals that your true value lies in helping others recognize their unique beauty and creative potential, guiding them to create in ways that they might not have imagined possible. This is about celebrating the vitality in others, not projecting an idealized form of success or ‘good’. Your models should inspire—by seeing people alive, active, and connected to their inner light. #### 2. Crafting and Refining Your Book (Barakanomics) - Revised Focus: Aim for a book that balances broad, transformative ideas with practical applications. Focus on broad principles, but within them, provide small, but powerful action steps. The idea is to leave people inspired while still giving them the tools to start their journey. Humanize the approach to avoid feeling stiff or overly “step-by-step,” and emphasize self-reflection, choice, and agency. The book should emphasize what you can become, not just what you can do. - Key Proposition: The economic system should facilitate us to be more human, to feel connected, and to maximize the “gifts” we all uniquely bring to the table—this should come through as an evolving idea rather than a static blueprint. #### 3. Aligning Your Career with Personal and Financial Fulfillment After reflecting on your career's trajectory, here’s a plan to satisfy your career, personal growth, and financial needs, connecting with the right problems and audiences: --- #### Who Are You Serving? - Ideal Audiences: - Innovative action-takers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA): Social entrepreneurs, startup founders, young creators—people pushing boundaries but needing resilience and alignment frameworks for growth. - Human-scaled organizations: Think impact-driven startups or nonprofits that aren’t merely profit-driven but value authenticity and transformation. - Corporate Leaders Challenging Efficiency Norms: Specifically HR departments or innovation labs looking for novel pathways to boost team resilience, human well-being, and creativity while rethinking performance metrics. #### What Problem Do You Solve? - For Entrepreneurs: You help them realign with their deeper purpose in the business world, so that they don’t burn out but rather grow interconnectedly, pulling from the divine creativity within them. You help them rediscover beauty both in their work and in their people, ensuring their businesses thrive because they are resilient not just efficient. - For Corporate Leaders or HR: You provide a way to rehumanize the workplace. In an age when AI and productivity tools are transforming businesses, you help leaders maintain teams’ alignment with personal creativity and mental well-being, preventing AI from being used only to generate profits but to boost individual and team growth to its highest, most authentic potential. - For Every Audience: You guide people towards self-reflection, helping them navigate AI’s growth in ways that encourage deeper alignment with their gifts and purposes, bossing up with AI instead of relying on it as a crutch. --- #### Your Ideas/Frameworks to Offer - AI-Powered Alignment + Human Creativity: Workshop and tools where reflection is magnified by AI rather than replaced by it. For instance, a system where AI asks questions to guide creativity instead of just generating \"done work\"—helping participants delve into their blind spots and transform their projects with care, depth, and beauty. - Memory Crystal Career Gravesight: A tool or workshop that helps individuals see their career story backward—projecting their legacy given their actions today by helping them visualize key moments, contributions, and gifts that marked their progress. - Resilience Framework for Entrepreneurs: How to stay connected spiritually, emotionally, and creatively as their ventures grow. Post-traumatic growth pathways from failure, struggles, and resilience-based foundations. --- ### Pitch to You and Others #### Pitch for Entrepreneurs and Foundations “You’re walking a fragile path, juggling the weight of expectations, limitations, and burnout. But what if you could realign with the deeper purpose underneath your ambition? My workshops take you beyond productivity, uncovering the creative beauty behind your struggle and fostering a resilient team capable of long-term innovation. Together, let’s build a memory you will be proud of.” #### Pitch for Corporate and HR “I can help you re-enter humanity in the midst of all the AI and automation efficiencies your business is pursuing. You want stronger teams—teams that care deeply about their work and connect authentically. What if you could blow up old metrics, focusing instead on making your team feel healthy, connected, and purpose-driven? That’s where I come in—to lead your transformation from the inside out.” #### Pitch for Investors/Partners (e.g., book publishing or collaborations with Learning Planet or Fonda): “Are you looking for the next big conversation on transformation and well-being? Visionary thinkers in the MENA and globally are primed for a book on the intersection of human resilience, AI, purpose, and creating a business model that considers the collective good. In addition, my workshops could establish profound foundations globally, rejuvenating the current system.” --- ### Plan for January 24-31, 2024 - January 24: Reflect deeply on your story: What have you accomplished and learned, and where did that learning show up in the lives of those you’ve worked with? Curate those stories into usable metrics that confirm the impact of your work thus far. - January 25: Map out your “AI-powered reflective tools” in more detail, defining pragmatic outcomes (e.g. better creativity, deeper engagement) and write them up as workshops or tools. - January 26: Develop the “memory crystal dashboard” to track individual and organizational team growth. Create two versions: One for entrepreneurs and one for corporate HR departments. - January 27: Collaborate or research best tools for AI and human creativity alignment. Reach out to possible collaborators like Pascal or organizations already working with AI and see if they might help you prototype your ideas. - January 28-29: Dive into your long-term book idea; trace the key themes, narrowing down the most relevant chapters and topics. Rework the structure of Barakanomics focusing more on principles and values, with less emphasis on rigid steps. - January 30: Refine your landing page to showcase upcoming workshops, books, and tools in development. Start developing partnerships and collaborations for the 2024 year (e.g., Learning Planet; Paris money/jobs). - January 31: Sit for three hours of reflection; write. Dedicate space to journal your new year’s path, writing affirmations and identifying the 3 breakthroughs you need for your career. --- #### Questions to Revisit and Go Deeper With 1. If you could radiate one truth in corporate and startup circles, what would it be, that helps remove the mask of ‘productivity over purpose’ for everyone meeting you? 2. How will you know when you’ve cracked the perfect blend of AI + human creativity in your tools, and what does that success look like for the world you care about? 3. What is the biggest scar of failure you’ve carried so long in your heart—how do you transform it knowingly, this year, so the story aligns with your remembrance of what matters most? --- Would you like to dive further into one of these paths or clarify a specific part of the plan above? for 14 seconds\nBelow is a vision of a future you’ll come alive in—one that balances your yearning for deep transformation, your desire to see the divine light in others, and your practical need to earn a living and share your gifts at scale. It addresses:Where and with whom you could collaborate (e.g., Spain, Learning Planet Institute, Pascal, co-founders)\nHow to refine your Barakanomics book to make it accessible yet transformative\nA career path that solves real problems while letting you shine\nFollowing that is a “pitch” you can use (with some tweaking) when you talk to potential partners, funders, or communities about what you offer. It focuses on the problem you solve, the frameworks or ideas that you bring, and how they provide real value.A Possible Life-Giving Path\nDecide on a Core “Product” Beyond Your TimeBook on Barakanomics: A structured but inviting journey into spiritual/regenerative economics.\nAI-Assisted Tool: Helps people reflect on their gifts, fosters alignment, and organizes their thinking into coherent outputs (instead of AI doing the work for them).\nModular Workshops: Short, impactful sessions (online or in-person) around post-traumatic growth, reflective AI usage, and “seeing the divine light” in everyday work.\nIdentify Collaborators and Locations That Energize YouLa Fonda in Spain: If it offers a community of creatives and innovators, it could be the perfect “human-scale” environment where people appreciate depth, resilience, and mystical edges.\nLearning Planet Institute in Paris: They focus on learning innovation, open science, and community-driven change. This might resonate deeply with your emphasis on reflection and well-being.\nLocal Partners (e.g., Pascal or new co-founders): People who share your passion for blending spirituality, design thinking, and AI. It could be a small but agile team capable of turning your big ideas into structured offerings.\nDesign a Structured Yet Fluid WorkflowMorning Creation: Dedicate 2 hours each day to writing or prototyping (the Barakanomics book, AI tool, or workshop outlines).\nCommunity Afternoons: Networking, calls, or co-working sessions with partners who can keep you accountable and expand your perspective.\nRegular Reflection: Schedule weekly personal “memory crystal” reviews: gather small data points, stories, and aha moments from your workshops or user feedback. This keeps you motivated and in touch with your deeper why.\nRefining the Barakanomics BookAnchor in Personal Stories: Open each chapter with a real-life anecdote (from your own experiments or from others) that crystallizes a key concept.\nOffer Gentle Frameworks: At the end of each chapter, include a short reflection or “experiment with beauty,” guiding readers to integrate ideas without rigid step-by-step instructions.\nMaintain Mystical Depth Without Overwhelm: Pick 3–5 core principles (e.g., humility, generosity, balance, gratitude, alignment with the divine) and weave them throughout as recurring themes.\nAdd Visual Elements: Create simple “memory crystals” or data snapshots (e.g., graphs, doodles, mind maps) to show how these principles come to life in practice.\n2. What Problem Are You Solving?\nProblem: In a hyper-competitive, AI-driven world, individuals and teams often feel disconnected from deeper meaning. Traditional approaches to productivity and “innovation” can lead to burnout or superficial results. Many are missing the spark of genuine alignment—where heart, mind, and spirit converge to create lasting value.Solution: Your work provides a pathway (through workshops, tools, writing, and frameworks) that reconnects people to their own inner resources, fosters a sense of awe and purpose, and harnesses technology (like AI) to enhance rather than replace human creativity. You help them quantify (in ways that matter) the richness of their personal and collective growth—what you call “memory crystals.”The Ideas & Frameworks You Offer\n“See, Feel, Do”\nA design-thinking-inspired approach that also taps into emotional and spiritual intelligence. It encourages people to:See what’s truly happening (beyond surface assumptions)\nFeel what resonates in their hearts, forming authentic motivations\nDo creative experiments that bring positive change\nPost-Traumatic Growth & Reflective AIPTG: Techniques to transform adversity into resilience and deeper insight, especially relevant for teams facing uncertainty.\nAI Tools: Reorient AI from a “replacement” mentality toward a “reflection” mentality—helping individuals see their strengths, articulate their ideas, and feel more ownership over the work.\nBarakanomicsA spiritual/regenerative economic framework emphasizing baraka (blessing, expansion, abundance rooted in alignment with the divine).\nEncourages ethical decision-making, communal wealth, ecological awareness, and personal growth as key success metrics.\nMemory CrystalsA fresh spin on measurement: blending numbers and stories to preserve the essence of each milestone.\nVisible proof that can spark gratitude, pride, and continued commitment.\n4. Example “Pitch” (To Yourself and to Potential Partners)\n**“Hi, I’m Bilal Ghalib. I help individuals and organizations discover a deeper sense of purpose and connection, especially in a rapidly changing, AI-driven world. Through workshops, reflective tools, and my Barakanomics framework, I guide people to ‘see, feel, and do’ in ways that spark true innovation and heart-centered growth.We use AI not to replace human creativity but to enhance it—helping participants form ‘memory crystals’ of their journey, both quantitative and qualitative, that keep them aligned with what truly matters. The result? Resilient teams, empowered individuals, and a new economic story that centers on ethical, regenerative practices.I’ve worked with diverse communities—post-traumatic growth workshops in Gaza, design thinking for marginalized groups, and AI reflection tools for creative teams—always with the same goal: help people come alive and create enduring impact. If you’re an organization or a community seeking this kind of alignment, I’d love to co-create with you.”**A Plan for January to Launch This New Chapter\nJan 24\nRetrospective & Story Gathering\nSpend a focused morning combing through old workshop notes, emails, participant feedback. Extract key “ah-ha” stories that illustrate how your approach impacted real people. Begin a Memory Crystal Document.\nJan 25\nDraft Barakanomics Chapter Sketches\nOutline 3–5 core principles (e.g., humility, generosity, balance, gratitude, alignment). For each principle, choose a personal story and a real-world story from your retrospective.\nJan 26\nAI Tool Conceptualization\nSketch a wireframe or flowchart for how your reflective AI tool might prompt users to generate their own text. Start small. (If time: record a short Loom video explaining your concept.)\nJan 27\nLanding Page Update\nMerge the new stories, your pitch, and “memory crystal” language onto a simple website or Notion page. Make it scannable, inviting, and anchored in the fresh stories you gathered.\nJan 28\nCo-Founder/Collab Outreach\nReach out to Pascal or potential collaborators to discuss your AI tool or workshop series. Also research La Fonda in Spain and Learning Planet Institute. Send short, compelling intro emails that reference your new pitch.\nJan 29\nBook Focus Day\nSpend a block of hours fleshing out a single “Barakanomics” chapter. Incorporate at least one memory crystal from your retrospective. End the day with a quick read-through to see if it feels coherent and inspiring.\nJan 30\nAI Reflection Beta Testing\nIf feasible, test a rudimentary version of your AI reflection prompts with a few friends or past workshop participants. Gather feedback on clarity, engagement, and sense of ownership.\nJan 31\nAlignment & Future Vision\nHost a private “alignment session” for yourself. Revisit your memory crystals, track how the week went, and finalize February’s plan. Decide if you’ll invest more time in seeking corporate leads, or double down on community-driven, mission-aligned groups.Three Deep Questions to Inspire Revision\nWhat part of you still resists “measuring” success, and how can you integrate that resistance to maintain authenticity while creating structures that sustain you?\nIs there a place or group of people that consistently energizes you, and how can you intentionally spend more time with them to refine and test your ideas?\nIf you imagine an ideal day in 2025—where your book is out, your AI tool has a user base, and you’re earning sustainably—how do you feel in that scenario, and what small decisions right now move you closer to that feeling?\nFinal Note\nThis plan, pitch, and reflection aren’t about fitting yourself into someone else’s box—they’re about crystallizing (literally, in memory crystals!) what already makes you shine and taking the steps to share it with the world in a way that’s fulfilling, financially sustainable, and true to your vision of divine-inspired aliveness in people and their actions.Edit2 / 2Let me revise this vision based on your responses. I notice a few key themes emerging that could guide a more focused direction:\nYour Core Gift: Seeing & Amplifying Divine Light\nYou're uniquely able to see and help others recognize the divine light within themselves - not through prescribed steps but through genuine presence and reflection. This could be your differentiator in the space of personal and organizational development.\nIdeal Format: Tools & Frameworks That Scale\nRather than pure consulting or workshops, your impact could be greater through:\n\nThe Barakanomics book - focused on principles of divine beauty in business\nAn AI reflection tool that helps people recognize and articulate their unique gifts\nSupporting frameworks for organizations to measure what truly matters\n\nTarget Audience Revision\nInstead of corporate HR, you might focus on:\n\nSocial innovation hubs (like Learning Planet Institute)\nMission-driven organizations and founders\nCommunities seeking deeper alignment (like La Fonda)\n\nConcrete Next Steps\n\nFor Memory Crystal Development:\n\n\nCreate a simple dashboard tracking stories of transformation\nInclude qualitative feedback from past workshops\nFocus on moments where people discovered their own light\n\n\nFor Book Development:\n\n\nCenter each chapter around a principle of seeing beauty\nInclude real stories of transformation\nBalance between mystical depth and practical application\n\n\nFor January Planning:\n\n\nFocus on prototyping your AI reflection tool\nReach out to Learning Planet Institute and La Fonda\nBegin crafting the memory crystal dashboard\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper into any of these areas? For instance, I could help sketch out what the memory crystal dashboard might look like, or we could outline a specific chapter of Barakanomics that balances depth with accessibility.\nThree Questions for Further Reflection:\n\nWhat moments in your work have made you feel most alive and aligned with your purpose?\nHow could your AI tool help people discover their own divine light rather than just becoming more productive?\nWhat would make the memory crystal dashboard feel like a genuine reflection of impact rather than just another metrics tool?"
