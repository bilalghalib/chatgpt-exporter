This is for a community called the Wellbeing Projects Ecosystem. There are a lot of sub-communities inside of it, and the problem that we're trying to solve is that there's just a lot of things that people are reaching out to the main team members at the Wellbeing Project, and they're wondering if there's another way to do this that doesn't actually take time.

And I'm wondering what other problems do you think stimulated this concern and this need? And why, so Aaron wants an app. I'm not sure why exactly. I think he wants to kind of make it a little broader and make it connected instead of like a separate app. I think it's supposed to be like, you know, they register, they log in, and they have access to things. But also, it's like, somehow it's related to this as well. I'm not exactly sure what that app's going to be. I'm going to talk to him a little bit later today. So maybe you can help me, like, gather some questions to ask as well. But, like, maybe we should also just do some brainstorming together on, like, what could the problems that he's facing actually be? And can we figure this out before my meeting with him in an hour?

So if Aaron’s main pain point is that he’s tired of answering these really common, repetitive questions, that tells us a lot. It tells us that there’s a need for a self-serve resource that’s really trustworthy and easy to navigate, and that people actually know exists. And I think you’re right, part of it might be that he envisions an app as a way to broaden that and make it really accessible, or just to make it feel more like a dedicated space rather than just a website that people forget about.\\n\\nSo a few angles you can think about or questions you can ask him might be: What kinds of questions come up the most often besides just the therapist one? Are there patterns in the kind of information people are looking for? Also, does he imagine that the app would be a space where people can not only find info but also connect with each other or share their own resources? Basically, is it more of a directory or is it also a community hub?\\n\\nAnd then another thing you can do is come prepared with a few ideas—like maybe suggest that the app could have a quick matchmaking feature where people can find others in the community with similar needs. Or you could propose that it includes a little seasonal check-in, where every season people update something small and get a new resource in return. That way it feels more like an ongoing exchange rather than a one-time thing.\\n\\nIn other words, you’re coming in with a few thoughtful questions and a few creative ideas so he can see that you’re really thinking along with him.

They don't know what's actually valuable. So if other people can help them see that through an interview process, it is a bit of an overhead, but it doesn't have to be everyone that does it.

And in return, they get to read someone else’s. It’s kind of like a community storytelling loop that makes the directory feel more alive.\\n\\nSecond idea: maybe there's a “gratitude wall” or a kind of kudos board where people can leave little notes of appreciation for others in the community. It makes the space feel supportive and encourages people to interact in a positive way.\\n\\nThird idea: you could have a seasonal or quarterly “learning circle” where people update their info as part of joining a small group discussion. So, each time they fill something out, they also get invited to a virtual or in-person meetup to talk about a theme. That way, the directory update is tied to a real-life connection.\\n\\nFourth idea: consider a map feature, like you mentioned, where people can see where everyone is located globally. You can make it interactive so they can click on a region and see who’s nearby, which encourages local meetups or just helps them feel more connected to the global network.\\n\\nAnd a fifth idea: maybe there's a “peer spotlight” feature where each month or quarter a few members get highlighted, and part of that spotlight is that they get interviewed by a peer.

Besides the therapist question, what other common needs do we want to address?\\n2. How do we envision the role of community leads in helping members connect?\\n3. Would we like to include an offers-and-needs board as part of the platform?\\n4. How do we want to handle personal or sensitive needs that might not fit the public space?\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd that's a nice clean outline you can use.

It's about creating a culture of shared wisdom and these little moments of giving that feel really meaningful.\\n\\nAnother value might be creating a sense of being seen and understood. For Aaron and for the facilitators, it's about having a space where people feel like they can show up as they are and be valued for their lived experiences. It's less about just a transaction of information and more about honoring each person’s unique journey.\\n\\nFor the community leads and the Wellbeing team, a key value is probably creating a sustainable rhythm. It’s not just a one-time data grab, but a living, breathing practice of checking in, sharing, and supporting one another over time. That’s the “being” part—creating an ongoing culture rather than a one-off task.\\n\\nAnd for you as a designer, it’s probably about crafting a tool that feels like a graceful extension of the community’s values—something that makes it easier to live those values out in everyday interactions.\\n\\nSo in short, the app is about helping everyone—Aaron, the facilitators, the community—step into a shared space of generous giving, being seen, and creating a rhythm of mutual care.

Context\r\n\r\nThe Wellbeing Project ecosystem brings together practitioners, educators, funders, and community weavers who care about the inner life of changemakers. Right now, a lot of connection happens through personal relationships and back-channel messages (“Do you know a good therapist?”, “Who could we bring in to hold this circle?”). \r\n\r\nThis is warm and human—but it overburdens a few key people (like Aaron and the core team) and hides a lot of the community’s wisdom and gifts.\r\n\r\nThe “Hearth” app / directory is a gentle layer on top of the existing ecosystem. It should:\r\n- Keep the warmth and relational quality of the network.\r\n- Make it easier for people to find support, practices, and each other.\r\n- Reduce repetitive requests landing on the same people.\r\n- Create new spaces of emergence and surprise.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Beauty & Ways-of-Being This App Serves\r\n\r\n**We’re not just building a directory. We’re tending a hearth.**  \r\nThe app should help people *practice* certain ways of being, not just complete tasks.\r\n\r\n### For Aaron & the core Wellbeing Project team\r\nThe app helps them pay attention to:\r\n- **Sustainable care** – the work of connecting people is shared, not resting on one or two shoulders.\r\n- **Seeing the whole field** – being able to sense who is in the ecosystem, where they are, and what is alive for them.\r\n- **Stewarding a movement, not a contact list** – noticing patterns, gaps, and emergent possibilities for the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n### For community weavers, hearth holders, and group leads\r\nThe app helps them pay attention to:\r\n- **Who is being under-seen** – people whose gifts are present but not yet called in.\r\n- **Who needs tending** – people raising needs, questions, or vulnerabilities.\r\n- **Where to invite reciprocity** – matching offers and needs in a way that feels relational, not transactional.\r\n\r\n### For practitioners and community members\r\nThe app helps them pay attention to:\r\n- **Owning their wellbeing journey** – seeing themselves as active shapers of their own care, not passive recipients.\r\n- **Sharing what has carried them** – practices, therapists, and experiences that genuinely helped, offered as gifts to others.\r\n- **Feeling part of a living movement** – “I’m not alone; I can see myself in a wider hearth of people with similar longings.”\r\n\r\n### For you (Bilal) and other designers/hosts\r\nThe app helps you pay attention to:\r\n- **Designing for unfolding, not maximizing** – not optimizing clicks or engagement, but cultivating deeper coherence and care.\r\n- **Protecting slowness and depth** – letting some processes be intentionally unhurried (e.g., peer interviews, stories).\r\n- **Honouring provenance** – knowing who recommended what, who interviewed whom, where trust comes from.\r\n\r\n### What we are designing for the unfolding of\r\n\r\nRather than maximizing a metric, we’re designing conditions that let these things unfold over time:\r\n- Moments of **generous sharing** (“This helped me; maybe it will help you.”).\r\n- A felt sense of **belonging to a hearth** rather than a platform.\r\n- **Agency in wellbeing** (“I can ask, offer, choose, and help shape this space.”).\r\n- **Serendipitous connections** that no one could have planned in advance.\r\n- **A culture of appreciation**, where people are seen and thanked for their invisible care work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Core Problems / Jobs-to-be-Done\r\n\r\n1. **“Who do you know…?” overload**  \r\n   - JTBD: When someone in the ecosystem needs a therapist, a facilitator, or a specific kind of support, they can *self-serve from a trusted pool* rather than pinging Aaron or one of a few central people every time.\r\n\r\n2. **Hidden gifts, invisible people**  \r\n   - JTBD: Make it easy to see *who is here and what they bring* (skills, modalities, lived experiences, availability), so group leads and members can invite them in more often.\r\n\r\n3. **Fragmented channels & lost messages**  \r\n   - JTBD: Create a low-friction, searchable “memory” for the ecosystem that complements WhatsApp, Zoom, email, and in-person gatherings.\r\n\r\n4. **Static, one-off forms that die**  \r\n   - JTBD: Build a *living* profile/check-in process that fits the rhythms of gatherings and community life, rather than a form someone fills once and forgets.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Experience Principles (“Hearth, not Dashboard”)\r\n\r\n1. **Relational first, data second**  \r\n   - People encounter conversations, stories, and faces—not just filters and fields.\r\n\r\n2. **Invitations, not obligations**  \r\n   - The app invites people into gentle rituals (Hearth Season, peer interviews), rather than nagging them to “complete your profile 100%”.\r\n\r\n3. **Peer witnessing over self-marketing**  \r\n   - Profiles can be co-written through interviews: “This is how X shows up in the world,” written by a peer.  \r\n\r\n4. **Emergence & surprise**  \r\n   - The system occasionally surfaces unexpected connections: “You and Asha both named ‘grief work in movements’ as alive for you this season.”\r\n\r\n5. **Light but honest structure**  \r\n   - Enough schema (fields, tags) to actually route needs and offers, but always paired with narrative fields and nuance.\r\n\r\n6. **Consentful layers & safety**  \r\n   - Clear boundaries between: public to the whole ecosystem, visible only to hearth holders, and “not for the app”.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. Key Experiences & Features\r\n\r\n### 5.1 Peer-Interviewed Profiles\r\n\r\n- **Flow**\r\n  - A member opts into being interviewed by a peer (or volunteers to interview others).\r\n  - They have a light interview guide focused on stories, not just credentials.\r\n  - The interviewer drafts or co-drafts the profile and tags it with key themes, modalities, and roles.\r\n  - The profile shows: “Interviewed by ___ on (date).”\r\n\r\n- **Why**\r\n  - People often don’t see their own gifts clearly; peers can mirror them back.\r\n  - It turns a “form” into a relational encounter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5.2 Offers & Needs Board (Wellbeing-Focused)\r\n\r\n- Members can list:\r\n  - **Offers**: “I can host a grief ritual online,” “I coach leaders in burnout recovery,” “I can mentor someone starting a hearth.”\r\n  - **Needs**: “Looking for a therapist experienced with X,” “Seeking a co-facilitator for a retreat,” “Need advice on organisational wellbeing assessments.”\r\n\r\n- This is filterable by topic, region, language, and level of urgency.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5.3 Story & Practice Cards (Story Exchange)\r\n\r\n- Short, structured stories:\r\n  - “A practice that carried me during a hard season.”\r\n  - “A moment I felt the hearth around me.”\r\n- These become cards that can be browsed, searched, and sometimes featured in gatherings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5.4 Gratitude / Appreciation Wall\r\n\r\n- Simple feature where people can leave:\r\n  - Notes of thanks to individuals (“Thank you, Lina, for your quiet support last month.”)\r\n  - Gratitude to the wider hearth (“Grateful to be in a space where rest is honoured.”)\r\n\r\n- Can optionally appear on profiles as “appreciation snippets”.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5.5 Global Hearth Map\r\n\r\n- Map showing:\r\n  - Rough location (city/region, not exact address).\r\n  - Time zone, languages, and roles.\r\n- Useful for:\r\n  - Local meetups.\r\n  - Time-zone-aware invitations.\r\n  - Feeling the global spread of the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5.6 Spotlights & Learning Circles\r\n\r\n- **Spotlights**:\r\n  - A rotating set of profiles, stories, or practices highlighted each month/season.\r\n  - Often tied to a peer interview.\r\n\r\n- **Learning circles**:\r\n  - Small themed circles (e.g., “Wellbeing of activists,” “Somatic work in organisations”) where participants update a small part of their profile as part of joining (“What is alive in your wellbeing journey right now?”).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5.7 Therapist & Practitioner Finder\r\n\r\n- A dedicated view for:\r\n  - Therapists.\r\n  - Coaches.\r\n  - Bodyworkers / somatic practitioners.\r\n  - Spiritual/reflective companions.\r\n\r\n- Incorporates:\r\n  - Tags (modalities, languages, communities they’re experienced with).\r\n  - Provenance (“Recommended by ___”, “Trusted by ___ hearth”).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6. Data We Collect (Application & Check-In Structure)\r\n\r\n### 6.1 Identity & Presence\r\n- Name, pronouns (optional).\r\n- Country/city or region.\r\n- Time zone.\r\n- Languages.\r\n- How they like to be contacted (email, Signal, etc.).\r\n\r\n### 6.2 Roles & Capacities\r\n- Main roles in the ecosystem (practitioner, educator, funder, activist, organisational lead, artist, etc.).\r\n- Short bio / “how I tend to show up at the hearth”.\r\n\r\n### 6.3 Modalities & Practices\r\n- Modalities they work with (e.g., somatics, systems constellations, contemplative practice, indigenous traditions—self-described).\r\n- Contexts they’re most familiar with (NGOs, social movements, philanthropy, etc.).\r\n\r\n### 6.4 Trusted Resources\r\n- Therapists / practitioners they can vouch for (with optional short context: “Helped me through…”, “Specialised in…”).\r\n- Books, practices, or communities that have been especially nourishing.\r\n\r\n### 6.5 Offers & Gifts\r\n- “What I can offer to this hearth in the next 6–12 months” (free, sliding scale, paid—clear but gentle framing).\r\n- Availability constraints (seasons, time zones, energy level).\r\n\r\n### 6.6 Needs & Questions\r\n- Current wellbeing questions or edges (“Where I’m learning/growing right now…”).\r\n- Types of support they might seek from the network.\r\n\r\n### 6.7 Ways-of-Being They Want to Lean Into\r\nInstead of “values,” a list of gentle statements they can select or add to, for example:\r\n- “Making time to tend to others’ wellbeing in my daily work.”\r\n- “Letting myself receive support, not only give it.”\r\n- “Honouring the limits of my body and energy.”\r\n- “Staying connected to joy and play, even in heavy work.”\r\n- “Seeing myself as part of a wider movement, not alone.”\r\n\r\nThese become part of their profile and can be used for:\r\n- Matching into circles.\r\n- Surfacing resonant connections.\r\n\r\n### 6.8 Participation Preferences & Consent\r\n- Open to being interviewed? (yes/no/maybe later).\r\n- Open to mentoring / being mentored?\r\n- Comfortable being featured in spotlights? (yes/no/ask each time).\r\n- Visibility preferences for different fields.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7. Rhythms for Keeping It Alive\r\n\r\n1. **Annual “Hearth Season” Update**\r\n   - Once a year (often around a major gathering), everyone is invited to *re-visit* their profile through a short, reflective prompt, not a long form.\r\n   - Could be a communal ritual: “What has shifted in your wellbeing journey this year?”\r\n\r\n2. **Peer Interview Weeks**\r\n   - Designated windows where people sign up to interview or be interviewed.\r\n   - Generates a wave of fresh, relationally-written profiles.\r\n\r\n3. **Post-Event Micro Prompts**\r\n   - After a retreat, hearth gathering, or learning circle, participants receive:\r\n     - “What is one practice or resource from this gathering that you’d like to add to your profile or the shared cards?”\r\n\r\n4. **Access-with-Gift Moments**\r\n   - When someone requests something from the ecosystem (e.g., therapist suggestions), the app might gently ask:\r\n     - “Before we show you the list, are you open to adding one small thing to your profile—an offer, a need, or a practice that has helped you?”\r\n   - Not coercive, but framed as reciprocity.\r\n\r\n5. **Quarterly Spotlights & Story Cycles**\r\n   - Each quarter, a small set of members and practices are spotlighted.\r\n   - The selection process becomes another moment to review profiles, update information, and invite quieter members in.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8. Notes & Open Design Questions\r\n\r\n- How “finished” does a profile need to be before it’s shown? Can we normalise that profiles are always in draft?\r\n- Who, concretely, will steward rhythms like Hearth Season or Peer Interview Weeks?\r\n- What level of vetting is appropriate for therapists and sensitive referrals, and how is responsibility shared or bounded?\r\n- How do we make sure people without strong internet or tech comfort can still meaningfully participate in the hearth?\r\n- How does this app sit alongside existing channels (WhatsApp, email, in-person gatherings) without trying to replace them?\r\n\r\nThis is a starting canvas you can bring into conversation with Aaron and the Wellbeing Project team, and then refine together.\r\n\"\"\")\r\n\r\ncsv_content = dedent(\"\"\"\r\nCategory,Idea / Feature,Purpose,Who It Mainly Serves,Data / Structure Needed,Notes / Risks / Questions\r\nProfiles,Peer-Interviewed Profiles,Turn profiles into relational reflections instead of self-marketing,Members & community weavers,\"Profile fields, interview notes, 'interviewed by' attribution\",Takes time; need clear opt-in and simple guide.\r\nDirectory,Offers & Needs Board,Make it easy to see how people can help each other and what support is needed,\"Members, hearth holders\",\"Offers, needs, tags, urgency, region\",Risk of overwhelm; may need light curation.\r\nStories,Story & Practice Cards,Share concrete practices and stories that carried people through,All members,\"Short narrative fields, practice tags, links\",Need safety guidelines for depth/vulnerability.\r\nAppreciation,Gratitude / Appreciation Wall,Make invisible care visible and nourish a culture of thanks,Whole ecosystem,\"Short notes linked to profiles / general wall\",Moderation for boundaries and potential discomfort.\r\nMap,Global Hearth Map,Give a felt sense of global spread and support local connection,\"Members, organisers\",\"Location (city/region), roles, time zone\",Privacy concerns; location should be coarse, not precise.\r\nRhythm,Hearth Season Annual Update,Create a yearly ritual to refresh profiles with reflection,Whole ecosystem,\"Date-based prompts, minimal update form\",Needs clear holding and communication.\r\nRhythm,Peer Interview Weeks,Generate waves of updated profiles and deepen peer connection,\"Members, community weavers\",\"Sign-up flow, pairing, interview templates\",Could overburden a small group if not shared.\r\nEvents,Learning Circles with Profile Touchpoints,Tie profile updates to real conversations and themes,\"Participants, circle hosts\",\"Circle topics, participation records, small prompts\",Hosts need simple tools; avoid admin overload.\r\nDirectory,Therapist & Practitioner Finder,Provide a trusted, self-serve way to find practitioners,\"Members seeking support, core team\",\"Practitioner profiles, tags, recommendation provenance\",Liability & expectations; need clear framing of responsibility.\r\nIncentives,Access-with-Gift Moments,Invite small acts of reciprocity when people request from the network,Members,\"Trigger points (e.g., search), micro-prompts, optional fields\",Must feel invitational, not coercive.\r\nSpotlights,Peer Spotlights & Story Cycles,Regularly lift up different people and practices,Whole ecosystem,\"Spotlight selection, stories, visuals\",Guard against popularity contests; ensure diversity.\r\n\"\"\")\r\n\r\n# Write files\r\nmd_path = \"/mnt/data/wellbeing_hearth_concept.md\"\r\ncsv_path = \"/mnt/data/wellbeing_hearth_catalog.csv\"\r\n\r\nwith open(md_path, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\r\n    f.write(markdown_content)\r\n\r\nwith open(csv_path, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\r\n    f.write(csv_content)\r\n\r\nmd_path, csv_path",

Quick view of the tabular catalog\n\nThe CSV has columns:\n\n- **Category** (Profiles / Directory / Rhythm / etc.)  \n- **Idea / Feature**  \n- **Purpose**  \n- **Who It Mainly Serves**  \n- **Data / Structure Needed**  \n- **Notes / Risks / Questions**\n\nExample rows:\n\n- *Peer-Interviewed Profiles* – Relational profiles instead of self-marketing; needs interview notes + attribution; risk of time burden.  \n- *Offers & Needs Board* – Match help/gifts; needs tagged offers/needs; risk of overwhelm.  \n- *Therapist & Practitioner Finder* – Self-serve support; needs tags + provenance; risk around responsibility/liability.  \n- *Hearth Season Annual Update* – Yearly ritual; needs date-based prompts; requires clear stewardship.  \n\n…plus story cards, gratitude wall, map, spotlights, learning circles, access-with-gift, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Five pointed questions to sharpen this before your call\n\nThese are framed partly from a **community manager** lens and partly from a **participant** lens:\n\n1. **Vetting & responsibility:**  \n   When someone finds a therapist or practitioner through the hearth, *who* is considered responsible (if anyone) for that recommendation—the Wellbeing Project, the individual who recommended them, or “the community” in a looser sense?  \n   > This will shape copy, consent language, and how “trusted” labels work.\n\n2. **Minimum viable rhythm:**  \n   If the team can only commit to *one* strong recurring rhythm in year one (e.g., Hearth Season, Peer Interview Week, or Quarterly Spotlights), which feels most alive and realistic to steward—and why?  \n   > This keeps you from designing a beautiful but unsustainably complex ritual ecology.\n\n3. **Boundaries with WhatsApp / email / live gatherings:**  \n   In Aaron’s ideal world, *what specific types of requests* should move from his inbox / WhatsApp to the app (e.g., “find me a therapist”, “who can hold X-type circle”), and which should *stay* human/1-1?  \n   > This clarifies the app’s job and avoids “do everything” creep.\n\n4. **Depth vs. safety in sharing:**  \n   How deep do you *want* people to go in public stories and profiles (e.g., naming specific traumas vs. more general language), and what kinds of content should be explicitly *discouraged* or restricted to private channels?  \n   > This influences prompts, moderation guidelines, and consent flags.\n\n5. **Reciprocity & time ask from participants:**  \n   In practice, how much time do you feel comfortable asking a typical participant to invest per year *purely in the app layer* (minutes per season / per year)? And what *concrete benefit* would they need to feel, for that time to feel “worth it”?  \n   > This will anchor how long interviews are, how often prompts nudge people, and how demanding the profile is.\n\nIf you answer these five for yourself before the call, you’ll be able to walk in with both a **beautiful vision** and some very grounded, “here’s the shape of this thing” constraints.\n\nIf you want, next step we can:  \n- Strip this into a 1-page PDF concept note, or  \n- Turn the table into a first-pass data model (entities/fields/relationships) for a v0 tech architecture.",

And I kind of like the idea of keeping track of changes, right? That is information. Not only the information of what is the current state, but the past state. Just so that we can say something about how someone has changed, or grown, or moved. I'm not sure how to use that information in a way that's heartfelt, and reasonable, and meaningful, and not privacy problematic. And yeah, I want you to think with me about how we can do this so that it doesn't feel like anything that they've ever done on a computer before. What can we do to make this profile development really unique and beautiful, actually? Come up with five divergent ways, first assess our conversation to understand my values and how I approach things, and then see if you can take that to come up with five divergent ways to bring it to life. What are my constitutive attentional policies? What would I find beautiful? And let's do it.",

What your CAPs look like (from this convo)\n\nFrom this and earlier chats, I’d summarise your *constitutive attentional policies* roughly like this:\n\n1. **Attend to generosity over extraction**  \n   You like designs where people *give* something that’s meaningful to them (a practice, a contact, a story) rather than just being mined for data.\n\n2. **Attend to relationships over artifacts**  \n   You’re drawn to things like peer interviews, buddy systems, identity as “givers” – the form is a side effect of a human encounter, not the main event.\n\n3. **Attend to change over static snapshots**  \n   You care about *how people move* (well-doing → well-being; past → present) and want to see growth without turning it into a KPI.\n\n4. **Attend to emergence over control**  \n   You like affordances for surprise (“things we wouldn’t even imagine possible becoming possible”) rather than locked-down funnels.\n\n5. **Attend to reverence over optimisation**  \n   Hearth, beauty, slowness, sacredness of self-disclosure – you want this to feel nothing like a SaaS onboarding, more like lighting a candle.\n\nSo: generosity, relation, change, emergence, reverence. I’ll bake those into the 5 designs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Five divergent ways to do “profile” that feel unique & beautiful\n\nThink of these as *modes* the system supports. You could pick one as canonical, or let people choose a ritual style.\n\n---\n\n### 2.1 The Hearth Letter (Narrative-first profile)\n\n**Experience**\n\n- First login each year is framed as:  \n  > “Write your Hearth Letter for this season of your life.”\n- Three short prompts instead of fields:\n  1. *What are you tending in your inner life right now?*  \n  2. *What practices / people have carried you lately?*  \n  3. *What would you gladly offer to others from this place?*\n- They write in their own language/voice (even audio → transcript later).\n- After submitting, the app shows:  \n  > “Here’s how we might reflect this in your profile”  \n  with suggested tags (modalities, offers/needs, ways-of-being) they can edit/approve.\n\n**Data model angle**\n\n- Store the full letter as a `hearth_letter` record (id, person_id, year, raw_text, maybe audio_url).\n- Store an associated `profile_snapshot` with a JSON blob extracted from that letter:\n  - `modalities`, `offers`, `needs`, `ways_of_being`, etc.\n- `profile.current_snapshot_id` points to the latest snapshot; previous ones are kept for history.\n\n**How history is used (non-creepy)**\n\n- Once a year, the app can offer a private “Timeline of your Hearth Letters” to *them only*, e.g.:  \n  > “Three years ago you wrote about exhaustion; this year you wrote about boundaries. Anything you want to honour about that journey?”\n- If they choose, they can mark a past line as “okay to share as a story card” – nothing is auto-surfaced.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 The Peer Mirror (Profile by interview)\n\n**Experience**\n\n- On first login, they can choose:  \n  > “Fill this on my own” *or* “Co-create it in a conversation.”\n- If they choose conversation, the system:\n  - Lets them request a peer interviewer (or pick someone they know).\n  - Provides a very light interview guide focused on stories:\n    - “Tell me about a time you felt most alive in your work.”\n    - “What kind of care have you learned to ask for?”\n- The interviewer writes the profile in the third person, then the interviewee approves/edits.\n\n**Data model angle**\n\n- `interviews` table:\n  - `id, interviewer_id, interviewee_id, date, notes, recording_url(optional)`.\n- `profile_snapshot` has `source = 'peer_interview'` and `interview_id`.\n- Same schema as above, but with provenance: “Interviewed by X”.\n\n**History, beautifully**\n\n- Over years, a person might have multiple interviews by different people.\n- The app can surface to them:  \n  > “Here’s how three different people described how you show up.”  \n  as private “mirror” reflections.\n- Optionally, they can choose one to be the public profile, others kept private.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 The Seasons Wheel (Micro-check-ins instead of a big form)\n\n**Experience**\n\n- Instead of one heavy yearly form, there’s a **Seasons Wheel**:\n  - Four micro check-ins per year (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter – or analogous regional metaphors).\n- Each Season:\n  - 1–2 sliders or checkboxes for ways-of-being (“Which of these feels most alive right now?”).\n  - 1 mini free-text prompt like “One small shift in my wellbeing this season…”\n- The “profile” is just the aggregation of the last 4 seasons.\n\n**Data model angle**\n\n- `seasonal_checkins`:\n  - `id, person_id, season, year, ways_of_being_selected[], short_note`.\n- A materialised `profile_snapshot` is periodically recomputed from the last N seasons:\n  - Most-frequently selected ways-of-being → top values.\n  - Latest short note → “current edge”.\n\n**History use**\n\n- People can see their **seasons wheel** over time:\n  - A little ring per year showing which ways-of-being were chosen when.\n- No scores, only patterns:\n  > “You’ve named ‘letting myself receive support’ in three different seasons. Anything you want to do with that insight?”\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 The Offers & Needs Loom (Profile as a living weave)\n\n**Experience**\n\n- The “profile” page is literally a **loom-like list** of offers and needs, each with dates:\n  - Offer: “Host online circle on grief for organisers” (created March, archived October).\n  - Need: “Looking for supervision with X” (created July, resolved September).\n- During onboarding:\n  - Instead of generic “skills,” they’re invited to add *one* concrete offer and *one* live need.\n- Yearly:\n  - The app gently asks: “Which of these offers/needs are still alive? What wants to be added or let go of?”\n\n**Data model angle**\n\n- `offers`:\n  - `id, person_id, description, tags[], status (active/archived), created_at, closed_at`.\n- `needs`: analogous.\n- `profile_snapshot` doesn’t duplicate data; it just references active offers/needs.\n\n**History use**\n\n- Past offers/needs are archived but visible on their profile under a “Threads I’ve woven here” section if they consent.\n- This shows their *relational* footprint, not just attributes:\n  > “These are some ways you’ve been in exchange with this hearth.”\n\n---\n\n### 2.5 The Ways-of-Being Constellation (Profile as a value map)\n\n**Experience**\n\n- At onboarding, instead of lists of skills, they see a constellation of statements like:\n  - “Letting myself rest when my body asks.”\n  - “Bringing humour into heavy spaces.”\n  - “Making time to tend to others’ inner lives.”\n- They can:\n  - Mark some as *“Already part of me”*.\n  - Others as *“Growing into this”*.\n  - And add their own.\n- The profile is this 2-ring constellation: “lived” vs “leaning toward”.\n\n**Data model angle**\n\n- `ways_of_being_catalog`:\n  - `id, text, category (rest/boundaries/joy/relational/etc.)`.\n- `person_ways_of_being`:\n  - `person_id, wob_id, status (lived | growing), first_selected_at, last_updated_at`.\n- `profile_snapshot` pulls from this join table.\n\n**History use**\n\n- Each year, they can move items between rings.\n- The app, privately, can later say:\n  > “Two years ago ‘asking for help’ was in your ‘growing’ ring; now it’s in your ‘lived’ ring. Want to write a short note about that shift?”\n- That note can (optionally) become a story card about that value in action.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to track change technically without being creepy\n\nHere’s a light data model that can support all of the above:\n\n### Core entities\n\n- `users` – auth identity (email, password/SSO).\n- `persons` – the human in the ecosystem (`user_id`, name, pronouns, region, etc.).\n- `profile_snapshots`\n  - `id`\n  - `person_id`\n  - `created_at`\n  - `source` (`'hearth_letter' | 'peer_interview' | 'season_aggregate' | 'manual' | ...`)\n  - `data JSONB` – canonical structured profile (roles, modalities, offers, needs summary, ways_of_being, etc.)\n  - `visibility` (`'private' | 'ecosystem' | 'publicish'`)\n- `hearth_letters`, `interviews`, `seasonal_checkins`, `offers`, `needs`, `person_ways_of_being` as described above.\n\n### Versioning strategy\n\n- Treat every significant update (onboarding, yearly ritual) as a **new snapshot**, not a diff.\n- Keep all snapshots, but:\n  - Only the latest is used for search / directory views.\n  - Older ones are accessible only to the person unless they explicitly mark parts as shareable (e.g., turn a bit into a story card).\n- If you want extra safety:\n  - Only keep N years of raw text (e.g., last 5 years), but keep coarse tags longer in aggregate form.\n\n### Where the “nothing like any other computer thing” feeling comes from\n\nNot from the tables, but from:\n\n- **Framing:** every update as a ritual (letter / season / interview / loom / constellation), not “complete your profile.”\n- **Provenance:** “Interviewed by ___”, “Story drawn from your Hearth Letter 2027” – visible sources of trust.\n- **Consent gates:** before any past data is used publicly, a clear *“Is this okay to share?”* moment.\n- **Reflection back:** the system occasionally mirrors gentle patterns to *them*, not extractively to admins.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, next step I can:\n\n- Take 2–3 of these flows (say Hearth Letter + Peer Mirror + Seasons Wheel)  \n- And turn them into a **single coherent v1**: UX steps + endpoints + DB schema sketch you could hand to a dev.",

      "content": "Okay, so I'm gonna read what you wrote and then tell you how I feel, and you can update my constitutive attentional policies based on what I'm attending to in what you shared. So let's see. So you think generosity over extraction? Yeah, absolutely. Relationships over artifacts? Absolutely. Change over static? Yeah. Emergence over control? Reverence over optimization? Yeah, I love hearing the word optimism, and I think that part of me is thinking about like, yeah, this is kind of optimistic, and maybe something about realistic, and paced, and kind of fitting into someone's life in a way where it feels like a real asset, you know? Like, like money in the bank, something like that. I'm not sure what else I can describe it like, but you know, like when someone just knows that we've got your back, and can just trust fall? Yeah, something about like a trust fall, you know? I think that's really something that I think would be really wonderful to have. So the five divergent ways. Narrative first. I like that, although I'm not sure everyone can do it, and I think this connects to the idea of not having the time, right? And like just another assignment for people is a bit much, but I do like this idea of having it be like a place of reflection, like an optional place of reflection, and hey doggie! Yeah, and I feel like maybe something about the events that people go to, the Heart Summit, you know, we create a lot of connections and artifacts, and even especially in my group, we actually do a lot of these paper and pencil journaling and sharing in person, and we try to collect them, and we take pictures of everything at the end, and sometimes the organizers try to turn it into something, but I'm wondering if like there can be a photo section. You know, that's actually another thing that people really like, is music and photos, and we ask people on the WhatsApp group to share these things. Here's a like a personal thing for me, is like I don't like forgetting people's names for their partners, or if they have kids or not, or these kinds of things, and every once in a while I'm like, I don't know, and so that could like embarrassment reduction could be cool. Yeah, so here's how we might reflect this in your profile. Yeah, I'm wondering, should there be or should there not be a connection between the reflection section and your profile, and I'm really wondering how Richard Davidson's going to work on the assessment tool, so I feel like your profile should have your organization, and maybe even your profile should be able to invite other people from your organization into your profile, so that you can have that assessment connect all that data, but also I feel like it should be way simpler than that. This is turning into like a real big app, and what is the simpler thing that we can do, but yeah, the hearth letter, and you know like one cool thing that happens is people get Christmas letters, and I think the Wellbeing Project might be able to do a Christmas postcard. I kind of like that. I'm not sure exactly how or what it would entail, but I think there could be something really cool, and sharing something physical, and doing a like a Christmas postcard, and maybe having that be connected, could they like fill out some check boxes, and send a photo, or something that also sounds like something that might be really hard to facilitate, and that not everyone will do, and not everyone has a very clear home, or like a lot of gaps here, so something about practicality. History is used. Yeah, I don't think it should just be talking to them non-stop. That just sounds like a LLM, and kind of annoying. Everyone knows about LLMs now. It's not so interesting here, so let's go to the peer mirror. I like that. Something about working with some other humans, right, and connecting to them, and yeah, fill this out on my own, or co-create, and it could be like magic, or something like that, like we've magically selected this person for you that has maybe like common needs, or geographies, or it just could be really random, and we just tell them magic, and try to frame it that way, so that people start looking like, I wonder why I was matched with this person. Data model, interviews table, yeah, history, like what could this thing show, and I think that that's the real interesting thing here, is I feel like maybe with a fewer set of data points over time, we get a much more real idea of people's well-being journeys, and that way maybe we actually have, you know, less, technically less data points, but more meaningful data points, because it's data points over time, and I'm wondering if there's any research about that in terms of well-being assessments, or frameworks, and getting less data, but more quality data by going over time. Yeah, so peer mirror was interesting. Seasons wheel, microcheck, instead of forms. I like that seasons wheel, it's also how people do like happiness research, right? You just get like a quick note, it's like, hey, how are you doing, and I think there's something important about that, where we actually get people not in a state where, you know, there's a this book called Personality is Impermanent, which talks about all of these profiling approaches, and their problems, because it really depends on how they're feeling that day, and when they fill out the form, and even like context and framing, and doing it with this like random thing, where they get a pop-up message, and that pop-up message will ask them some questions, I think can be a great way to get around that. Offers wheel and needs loom. Yeah, I think just, I like the idea of keeping things hearthy, but also keeping things simple and clear, so offers and needs don't need to loomify things. Yeah, I wonder how to do that. Yeah, instead of generic skills, I think I like this idea of like a gift, right? It's a gift, and yeah, maybe even including like what they can do, right? I also feel like maybe some people might be able to host people, or even, you know, like if people need hookups somewhere in a geography, like they might be able to give that, so it's not just where they are, but like where they have experience and knowledge, and yeah, maybe like what I'd be willing to get on an half-hour, hour-long Zoom call and talk your head off about, right? I think a lot of people in this org have that capacity, and then maybe like a booking thing, right? Like it could start a process of getting into a Google Calendar or something like that. I don't know if that's too much. Ways of being constellation profiles. Yeah, ways of being. Yeah, growing into this part of me. I like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I really like this like ways of being element. It's also a way of kind of flagging and indicating what for ourselves and for others, like what we're trying to grow into and who we're trying to become. How to attract users. Versioning strategy. Yeah, so let's see what the nothing is like. Framing. Yeah, rituals I think are great, but how do we keep it ritual? Provenance. I like the idea of provenance, and yeah, so when you interview somebody, and maybe like we say who introduced you to the Wellbeing Project. That is less like who's your favorite Wellbeing Project person, but it also helps develop a kind of a network. We have some dimensionality and directionality, and we can also see like who are the network builders here, and yeah, that could be kind of interesting, but I'm wondering what else we could do besides like who introduced the network. It's like who did you speak with last in the network, or who who offered you a gift, and what was it in the network that made a difference for you in your way of being, right? And I think that way we can also just use that for the highlighting like the member of the year or something. If we do any sort of analysis, then yes consent gates the reflection back I don’t think I really want an AI here I think AI does. should trigger a connection to a real human being and I wonder how to open that up like we don’t want this to be the community platform. It’s supposed to be a resource so how do we really emphasize the resource angle and not the platform angle we a lot of these are like platform Matic but Aaron was mentioning that. Yeah they come on and it’s a resource and yeah, I think yeah there’s idea of like there’s gold here in this network that sort of emerges in moments where people connect and there’s like serendipity and I like that serendipity of like the in person stuff and then having the one time a year thing is interesting but maybe there can be like the seasonal pulse point right and it could be an optional thing that people opt into it. How would you like to receive a seasonal text message that you can respond to where it kind of can update your profile but also is like a check in on how things are going. Moment of reflection ",

Briefly answer your “fewer data points over time” research question.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Updated CAPs (what you keep circling around)\n\nHere’s a refined list of your constitutive attentional policies as I’m reading them now:\n\n1. **Generosity over extraction (unchanged, but sharper)**  \n   - You want people sharing *gifts* (stories, practices, connections, hosting, “talk-your-head-off” time), not filling quotas.  \n   - Data is a *side-effect* of generosity, not the goal.\n\n2. **Trust-fall reliability over feature richness**  \n   - You care that the network feels like: *“When I lean back, someone (or something) real has my back.”*  \n   - That means fewer, well-tended affordances that work *every time*, not a long list of cool-but-fragile features.\n\n3. **Paced realism over idealistic overload**  \n   - You’re allergic to asking people for “another assignment.”  \n   - Anything that takes more than a few minutes or doesn’t clearly feel like an asset in their life is suspect.  \n   - Seasonal text / tiny touchpoints > big one-off forms.\n\n4. **Embarrassment reduction & social safety**  \n   - You *hate* forgetting partners’ names, kids, etc.  \n   - You want the system to quietly hold this “relational memory” so people feel less awkward and more held, not exposed.\n\n5. **Analogue texture in a digital shell**  \n   - You like Christmas postcards, photos, music, scribbled workshop artifacts.  \n   - The app should feel like an archive of lived moments and paper traces, not just clean fields.  \n   - Physical/digital echoes (e.g., postcard ↔ profile) are beautiful *if* they’re light-touch.\n\n6. **Event-rootedness over free-floating digital-ness**  \n   - Heart Summit, hearth gatherings, in-person journaling: you want the app to *catch* those sparks, not compete with them.  \n   - “We already have the paper; how do we gently weave it in?” is a key question.\n\n7. **Serendipity & “magic” over explicit optimisation**  \n   - You loved the idea of **“magic” matches**: “We magically paired you with X.”  \n   - You like people wondering *“Why was I matched with this person?”* as a generative question.\n\n8. **Few high-quality time-series points over big static surveys**  \n   - You’re drawn to seasonal pulses / random check-ins with 1–2 meaningful items.  \n   - You like the idea that *patterns over time* are more real than big trait questionnaires. (More on that research below.)\n\n9. **Resource, not platform**  \n   - This thing is primarily: *“A trusted resource that helps me find people/practices/support when I need it,”*  \n   - NOT: *“where I hang out, post, and have ongoing conversations”*.  \n   - AI should be largely invisible and *defer back to humans*, not chat at people constantly.\n\nIf you’re happy with this, we can even use this internally as a “design test”: any feature that doesn’t fit at least 3–4 of these probably isn’t v1.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What this suggests for the design (v1 reframing)\n\nLet me adjust the earlier ideas through this new lens and aim for a *smaller, truer* v1.\n\n### 2.1 What a v1 Hearth “profile” really needs to be\n\n**Core idea:**  \n> “When I log in, this thing quietly remembers who I am, who I’m connected to, and how I might give/receive — and it’s easy.”\n\n**Minimal fields, aligned with your values:**\n\nFor *person*:\n\n- Basic identity: name, pronouns (opt), photo.  \n- **Relational memory bits:**  \n  - Partner name (optional).  \n  - Kids (names / age ranges / “rather not say”).  \n  - “People I’d love you to remember in my life” (free text, could be others – parents, elders, etc.).  \n- **Organisational link:**  \n  - Primary org.  \n  - Role in org.  \n  - Optionally: invite org teammates (ties into Davidson assessment ecosystem without building it all in-app yet).  \n- **Location & reach:**  \n  - City/region & time zone.  \n  - “Places I know well and can help you orient in” (Paris, Erbil, Nairobi…).\n\nFor *gifts / offers*:\n\n- 2–3 slots, each like:  \n  - “Title” – *“I can host a circle on…”* / *“I can talk your head off about…”*  \n  - Format: (call / in-person / email)  \n  - Typical length: (30min / 60min)  \n  - Tags: (e.g. activists, burnout, somatics, organisational change)  \n  - “Where this gift is strongest” – a location or context.\n\nFor *needs* (very light):\n\n- 1–2 current edges:  \n  - “What I’m learning / struggling with in my wellbeing right now.” (Short sentence).  \n  - “What kind of support could help?”\n\nFor *ways-of-being*:\n\n- A small constellation:  \n  - 3 statements in “This feels lived in me now.”  \n  - 3 in “I’m growing into this.”  \n- You can have a curated list + “add your own.”\n\nFor *network edges*:\n\n- “Who introduced you to the Wellbeing Project?”  \n- “Who in this network recently made a difference in your wellbeing? What did they do?”  \n  - That gives you provenance + a gratitude trail + network-weaver visibility.\n\n**No heavy narrative required.**  \nThe Hearth Letter becomes an *optional ritual*, not a requirement.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 How history & time-series work in a non-creepy way\n\n**Data model twist:**\n\n- You only store **a small number of “profile snapshots”**: e.g. one per year, plus seasonal pulses.\n- Seasonal pulses are *tiny*:  \n  - “Right now, I feel: [Resourced / On the edge / Overwhelmed / Numb / Not sure]”  \n  - “One sentence about what’s most alive in your inner world this season (optional).”\n\n**How it’s used:**\n\n- Mostly **for the person**, not the org:  \n  - They can see a simple seasonal graph or wheel of how their chosen “ways-of-being” and pulses changed.  \n  - Occasionally, the system prompts *them* to reflect (on login or yearly):  \n    > “Two seasons ago you named ‘letting myself receive support’ as something you’re growing into. Is that still alive for you?”  \n  - No constant chatter; this might be 1–2 prompts *per year*.\n\n- For the ecosystem side:  \n  - Only coarse, aggregated patterns might be seen by the Wellbeing team (e.g. “many people are naming exhaustion this season”) — if you decide that’s part of the deal and get consent.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Seasonal pulse via SMS / WhatsApp (the “moment of reflection” you just named)\n\nThis is very aligned with you:\n\n- Opt-in preference:  \n  - “Would you like 3–4 times a year to receive a short reflection prompt by SMS/WhatsApp that can gently update your profile?”  \n  - Yes / No / Email instead.\n\n- A seasonal message might be:  \n  > “Hearth check-in 🌱  \n  > Where is your inner life right now?  \n  > Reply with a number:  \n  > 1 – I feel grounded and resourced  \n  > 2 – Mostly okay, with some edges  \n  > 3 – Wobbly / stretched  \n  > 4 – Overwhelmed / close to the edge  \n  > 5 – I don’t know / prefer not to say”\n\n- Optional follow-up:  \n  > “If you want, reply with one short sentence about what’s most alive in your wellbeing. You can skip if you like.”\n\n- That creates:\n  - A **tiny time-series** for each person.  \n  - A **shared seasonal sense** for the team (if aggregated).  \n  - And it doesn’t feel like “another survey;” it feels like: *“they remembered me; they’re checking in.”*\n\nTechnically, these hooks can just update `seasonal_checkins` and adjust their “current state” on the profile.\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 Making it clearly a *resource*, not a platform\n\nYou’re right: a lot of what we’re talking about sounds “platformy.” So, sharpen:\n\n**On login, what’s front and center?**\n\n- Search / browse:\n  - “Find a therapist / practitioner”  \n  - “Find someone to talk your head off about X”  \n  - “Find someone in [region] / [time zone]”  \n- A **gentle panel**: “Hearth check-in (optional)” with a single prompt.  \n- Maybe a small rotating “magic match” tile:\n  - “We magically picked someone whose ways-of-being constellation overlaps with yours in some way. Want to meet?”  \n  - But making that click leads to *“Send them an email / message”*, not in-app DMs.\n\n**AI’s role (if any)**:\n\n- Backstage only: clustering tags, helping suggest matches, helping summarise paper artifacts into tags if someone uploads photos.  \n- Never an in-your-face chatbot.\n\n---\n\n### 2.5 Tiny touchpoints for embarrassment reduction & event integration\n\n**Embarrassment reduction:**\n\n- On a person’s detail page (for internal view):  \n  - A quiet “Relational notes” section they manage: partner name, kids, important people.  \n  - This is *not* globally visible if they don’t want it; or visible only to certain roles (e.g., hearth holders).  \n- When you (Bilal) go to look someone up before emailing them:  \n  - You see “Partner: ___ | Kids: ___” there.  \n  - The system is just being your memory prosthetic.\n\n**Event artifacts:**\n\n- After a Heart Summit / hearth gathering:\n  - A simple upload tool where a host can drop photos of paper journaling, group posters, playlists.  \n  - A human (maybe occasional AI assist) tags: “Participants: X, Y, Z; Theme: grief in movements; Practice: X ritual.”  \n  - Those tags can connect back to profiles as “Artifacts I was part of.”\n\nThis stays optional and host-driven, not another thing every member must do.\n\n---\n\n## 3. About “fewer data points, over time” in wellbeing research\n\nYou wondered if there’s any research on **less but longitudinal** vs **big static profiles**.\n\nShort version:\n\n- In wellbeing and affect research, **experience sampling / ecological momentary assessment (EMA)** shows that *repeated small measurements* tend to reduce measurement error and give a more faithful picture of how a person actually fluctuates, compared to one large, retrospective survey. citeturn1search0turn1search11  \n- Single-item, low-burden measures (like a 1–5 mood rating) can be surprisingly reliable when repeated over time; the “signal” comes from the trajectory, not each individual point. citeturn1search6  \n- The tradeoff is always participant burden: too many pings and people fall off; a small number of **meaningful, well-timed prompts** is usually the sweet spot. citeturn1search5turn1search4  \n\nSo your intuition — *“fewer, more meaningful prompts over time are better than one big, static profile quiz”* — is very much in line with how contemporary wellbeing research is moving.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, next I can:\n\n- Propose a **really tight v1 schema** (tables + key fields only) that matches this “resource, not platform” orientation,  \n- And a **single canonical yearly ritual + seasonal pulse flow** that you could literally storyboard for Aaron.",

      "content": "This is such a good place to bring research in—you’re basically designing a tiny, humane “measurement system” for a whole ecosystem. Let me do exactly what you asked:\n\n1. Bring **solid, replicable-ish sources**.  \n2. Propose **specific design decisions** and attach each one to research.  \n3. Ask you a few **tight questions** so you can choose between evidence-backed options.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Evidence backbone in plain language\n\nHere are the main research threads that matter for what you’re building:\n\n1. **Short, repeated check-ins beat one giant survey**  \n   - Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and experience sampling show you can get *better* estimates of people’s real wellbeing by using more frequent, short check-ins instead of infrequent, heavy questionnaires. citeturn2search0turn2search12turn2search8  \n   - A meta-analysis on EMA compliance found that **questionnaire length** increases burden more than frequency; short check-ins are key. citeturn2search16  \n\n2. **Single-item wellbeing measures are surprisingly solid**  \n   - Large, multi-sample work (Cheung & Lucas 2014) shows single-item life satisfaction measures correlate strongly with longer validated scales and behave similarly with respect to external variables. citeturn2search1turn2search5  \n   - Lucas & Donnellan’s analyses estimate reliability of single-item life satisfaction in the **0.68–0.74** range using longitudinal data, which is quite respectable. citeturn2search13turn2search9  \n   - Newer cross-country work confirms that single-item happiness/life satisfaction measures can be measurement-invariant across many countries, which matters for a global network. citeturn2search17  \n\n3. **Experiential / episode-based measures vs global reports**  \n   - Kahneman & colleagues’ Day Reconstruction Method and later work comparing global vs experiential measures show that **context & timing matter**: people answer differently depending on when/how you ask, and repeated/episodic measures can surface different aspects of wellbeing. citeturn2search10turn2search14turn2search18  \n   - That supports your intuition that *when* you ask (e.g. seasonal pulse vs one intake moment) changes what you learn.\n\n4. **Low-intensity digital check-ins can help without being huge “interventions”**  \n   - RCTs of simple text-message or low-intensity online interventions show that **weekly SMS or lightweight digital check-ins** can improve aspects of wellbeing or stress, especially when they’re brief and easy to respond to. citeturn2search7turn2search3turn2search11turn2search23  \n   - Reviews of digital mental health interventions emphasise that **dropout and burden are the main risks**; light-touch, low-friction designs are more sustainable. citeturn2search15turn2search19  \n\n5. **Burden & compliance in repeated sampling**  \n   - Work on EMA burden shows that people generally tolerate frequent prompts if each one is short; the main enemy is **long, intrusive questionnaires**, not occasional micro-pings. citeturn2search0turn2search24turn2search16  \n\nThese are all mainstream, heavily cited streams of work, not weird one-off studies.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Concrete design decisions + “because research says…”\n\nHere’s how I’d phrase some key choices so you can later say to Aaron / others:\n\n### Decision 1 — Seasonal micro-check-ins instead of big annual questionnaires\n\n> **Design:**  \n> People opt in to 3–4 **seasonal pulses** per year (via SMS/WhatsApp/email). Each pulse is:\n> - 1 quick rating (e.g. “How resourced do you feel right now? 1–5”)  \n> - Optional one-sentence reflection.  \n\n> **Why (research):**  \n> - EMA and experience-sampling show that repeated, short assessments give a more accurate picture of wellbeing and daily life than large, one-off surveys, and are better tolerated. citeturn2search12turn2search8  \n> - Studies comparing sampling designs find that **short questionnaires** minimize burden more than reducing frequency; a few well-timed pulses with 1–2 items fit that best-practice pattern. citeturn2search16turn2search24  \n\n---\n\n### Decision 2 — Use **single-item or ultra-short scales** for pulses\n\n> **Design:**  \n> - Seasonal pulses use **1–2 items** only (e.g. single item on “inner resourcedness” + maybe “I can access support if I need it”).  \n> - If any more depth is needed, use 2–3 validated micro-items, not a 20-item scale.\n\n> **Why (research):**  \n> - Single-item measures of life satisfaction and happiness show good validity and reliability across large samples and countries, close to multi-item scales. citeturn2search1turn2search13turn2search17  \n> - This lets you keep check-ins **tiny**, aligning with EMA findings on burden, while still being defensible when you talk to Davidson-world people who care about measurement. citeturn2search12turn2search0  \n\n---\n\n### Decision 3 — Time-series of a *few* pulses per person, not continuous tracking\n\n> **Design:**  \n> - Each person builds up a **small time series**: e.g. 3–4 pulses per year + 1 yearly profile update.  \n> - The system never pesters people weekly unless they explicitly opt into that.\n\n> **Why (research):**  \n> - Longitudinal analyses of wellbeing measures show that you can estimate stable aspects of wellbeing with relatively few repeated data points, as long as they’re spaced out and not all taken in one “mood.” citeturn2search13turn2search18  \n> - Digital mental health trials show dropout skyrockets with high burden; your population is busy, so a low-frequency, high-meaning pulse aligns with retention evidence. citeturn2search7turn2search15turn2search19  \n\n---\n\n### Decision 4 — Keep questionnaires **very short**; put depth into **stories / peer interviews**\n\n> **Design:**  \n> - “Data” parts are narrow: identity, a few ways-of-being, 1–2 offers, 1–2 needs.  \n> - Any deeper exploration happens via optional **Hearth Letters**, peer interviews, or artifacts (photos, music, workshop scribbles) that are *human experiences first, data second*.\n\n> **Why (research):**  \n> - EMA/compliance research is clear: longer questionnaires increase perceived burden and reduce data quality more than higher frequency does. citeturn2search16turn2search0  \n> - Global vs episodic wellbeing work (Kahneman/Schwarz/Lucas) shows that rich episodic measures add value, but they’re not something you can ask people to do constantly; they belong as **occasional, intentional rituals**, not standard intake. citeturn2search10turn2search14turn2search18  \n\nThis backs your instinct to make the rich parts optional and ritualised (Hearth Letter, peer mirror) rather than mandatory.\n\n---\n\n### Decision 5 — Opt-in seasonal SMS/WhatsApp prompts\n\n> **Design:**  \n> - Members choose if they want to get 3–4 texts per year with a simple check-in prompt.  \n> - They can reply with a number and optionally a short phrase; those replies update their profile state.\n\n> **Why (research):**  \n> - Trials of text-message and low-intensity digital mental health interventions show that simple, periodic messages can support wellbeing and are often well-received, with good engagement when they’re not daily spam. citeturn2search7turn2search3turn2search11turn2search23  \n> - Your use is actually *lighter* than most interventions: you’re using SMS as a moment of reflection + light data point, not as a full-fledged therapy program.\n\n---\n\n### Decision 6 — Aggregated, not individual analytics for the org\n\n> **Design:**  \n> - Individuals see their own time-series / patterns.  \n> - The Wellbeing Project team only sees **aggregated seasonal patterns** (e.g. “more people are naming ‘wobbly’ this season”) unless there is clear opt-in for individual follow-up.\n\n> **Why (research):**  \n> - EMA and digital mental health reviews repeatedly flag **privacy and surveillance concerns** as threats to trust and engagement. Keeping analysis at aggregated levels respects that and aligns with ethical recommendations. citeturn2search15turn2search19turn2search24  \n\nThis is where you can be explicit: *“We designed this to support a trust-fall, not to monitor you.”*\n\n---\n\n## 3. A few focused questions so we can lock choices in\n\nIf you answer these, I can write you a mini “Methods / Design Rationale” section you can literally paste into a concept note for Davidson & co:\n\n1. **Pulse frequency:**  \n   For the seasonal check-ins, what’s your ideal default?  \n   - A) 4 per year (true “seasons”),  \n   - B) 3 per year (linked to actual WBP event cycles),  \n   - C) Something else you already know fits their rhythm?\n\n2. **Number of items per pulse:**  \n   Do you want:\n   - A) **1 item** per pulse (pure minimalism; maximally light, fully defendable with the single-item literature), or  \n   - B) **2–3 items** (e.g. inner resourcedness, perceived support, and maybe one “joy/play” item), still short but with a bit more nuance?\n\n3. **Org-level view:**  \n   Are you comfortable with the WBP team seeing:\n   - A) Only aggregated stats by *season* (e.g. percentage of people in each category), or  \n   - B) Aggregated by *season + broad region* (e.g. Europe / MENA / Americas) so they can see geographical differences, or  \n   - C) No analytics at all in v1, just personal time-series?\n\n4. **Depth of optional rituals:**  \n   For things like Hearth Letters / peer interviews, what feels realistic:\n   - A) One **Hearth Letter** per year as a written or audio reflection, *optional*;  \n   - B) One **peer interview** per year (for those who opt in), with a very short interview guide;  \n   - C) Offer both, but you expect low uptake and want to design assuming only ~10–20% of the network uses them.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me your choices (A/B/C per question, or your own tweak), I can:\n\n- Draft a **“Design Rationale”** section that says  \n  *“We chose X because research Y shows…”*  \n- And structure it in a way that will look comfortable to people from Davidson / contemplative science / wellbeing research worlds *and* still feel hearthy and human.",

High-level Intent\r\n\r\nWe are **not** building a generic community platform.\r\n\r\nWe are building a **trusted resource layer** for the Wellbeing Project ecosystem – something people visit when they need support, connection, or a recommendation – that:\r\n\r\n- Feels like a **hearth**, not a dashboard.\r\n- Lightens the load on a few central people (“Who do you know…?” requests).\r\n- Lets members **trust-fall** into a wider movement: “When I lean back, this community has my back.”\r\n- Respects people’s limited time and attention, using **tiny but meaningful touchpoints** over time instead of heavy forms.\r\n\r\nThe app should be:\r\n\r\n> **A quiet memory and matchmaking layer for the ecosystem – not a new place where everyone has to “hang out”.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Core Design Principles\r\n\r\nThese principles come from both Bilal’s values and the Wellbeing Project’s ethos.\r\n\r\n1. **Generosity over extraction**  \r\n   - Profiles and updates are framed as *gifts* (stories, practices, connections, time) – never as “complete your data so we can analyse you.”\r\n\r\n2. **Relationships over artifacts**  \r\n   - The most meaningful “data” comes from relationships (peer interviews, gratitude, introductions), not just self-entered fields.\r\n\r\n3. **Trust-fall reliability over feature richness**  \r\n   - Better to have a small number of functions that work every time (e.g. “find a therapist,” “find someone to talk to about X”) than a complex social platform.\r\n\r\n4. **Paced realism over idealistic overload**  \r\n   - No big, one-off, 45-minute “profile assignment.”  \r\n   - Instead: small steps that fit into real lives – especially seasonal micro check-ins and simple profiles.\r\n\r\n5. **Embarrassment reduction & social safety**  \r\n   - The system quietly helps people remember names, partners, kids, context – to reduce social anxiety, not increase exposure.\r\n\r\n6. **Analogue texture in a digital shell**  \r\n   - Photos, music, workshop artifacts, letters – the app honours what already happens in the Heart Summits and gatherings, rather than forcing everyone into rigid forms.\r\n\r\n7. **Resource, not platform**  \r\n   - The primary job of the app is to help people **find people and practices** – not to replace the WhatsApp groups, Zoom calls, or in-person circles.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Key Decisions & the Research Behind Them\r\n\r\nBelow are the main design decisions, each with a short “because research…” note.\r\n\r\n### 3.1 Seasonal micro check-ins (3–4 per year)\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- Members can **opt in** to receive short check-ins 3–4 times per year (via SMS, WhatsApp, or email).  \r\n- Each check-in is:\r\n  - 1 quick rating (e.g. “How resourced do you feel right now? 1–5”)  \r\n  - Optional one-sentence reflection (“What’s most alive in your inner life this season?”)\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- Research on **ecological momentary assessment (EMA)** and experience sampling shows that repeated, short assessments over time give a more realistic picture of wellbeing than big, one-off questionnaires – and are often better tolerated.  \r\n- Studies on **participant burden** in EMA consistently find that **questionnaire length** is more harmful than moderate frequency: one or two items is usually fine; long surveys drive people away.  \r\n- This matches our value of **paced realism** and keeps the check-ins feeling like a gift (“they remembered me”) rather than an exam.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- Each person gets a small **time-series** of how “resourced / stretched / overwhelmed” they feel across the year.  \r\n- The Wellbeing Project can (if desired and consented) see **aggregated seasonal patterns** (e.g. “many in the ecosystem feel ‘wobbly’ this season”), without looking at individual trajectories.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.2 Single-item or ultra-short scales (instead of big batteries)\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- Seasonal check-ins use **1 core item** plus 0–1 optional extra items.  \r\n- Example:  \r\n  - “Right now I feel…” (1–5, from “grounded & resourced” to “overwhelmed / close to the edge”).  \r\n  - Optional: “I feel I can access support if I need it” (agree–disagree).\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- Large, multi-sample studies show that **single-item life satisfaction and happiness measures** can be surprisingly reliable and valid, correlating strongly with longer scales and behaving similarly across time and countries.  \r\n- This means we can **keep questions tiny** and still have scientifically defensible signals for people like Richard Davidson’s team.  \r\n- Fewer items respects attention and aligns with EMA best practices.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- Very low friction: people can respond in seconds.  \r\n- We can still meaningfully talk about “changes in wellbeing” over time at both personal and aggregated levels, without flooding people with questions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.3 Few, spaced pulses instead of frequent tracking\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- Default: **3–4 pulses per year**, plus one gentle yearly profile refresh.  \r\n- No weekly nagging unless someone explicitly opts into a more intensive track.\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- Longitudinal wellbeing research shows that you can estimate *stable* aspects of wellbeing with **relatively few** repeated measures, as long as they’re not all taken in one emotional moment.  \r\n- Digital mental health studies also show that too many prompts and too much “homework” drive dropout; our population is already busy and highly committed elsewhere.  \r\n- We prefer **fewer, well-chosen touchpoints** that people actually engage with over years.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- People feel invited rather than harassed.  \r\n- The data are still rich enough to see personal and collective shifts over time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.4 Keep forms very short; put depth into optional rituals\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- Standard “profile” is intentionally simple:  \r\n  - Who you are (identity, region, time zone).  \r\n  - 2–3 **gifts / offers** you’d gladly give (e.g. “I can host a circle on X” or “I can talk your head off about Y”).  \r\n  - 1–2 **current edges / needs**.  \r\n  - A small **ways-of-being constellation** (“lived in me now” vs “growing into this”).  \r\n- Deeper engagement happens in **optional rituals**:  \r\n  - A yearly “Hearth Letter” (written or audio) for those who want it.  \r\n  - Peer interviews where someone else mirrors your gifts back to you.  \r\n  - Uploading photos or artifacts from gatherings.\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- EMA and burden studies show that **long questionnaires** are experienced as heavy and reduce participation and data quality more than modestly increased frequency does.  \r\n- Work comparing global, retrospective wellbeing reports to experiential or episode-based measures (e.g. Day Reconstruction Method) suggests that rich, narrative data are meaningful – but are best used as *occasional, intentional rituals*, not as standard intake for everyone.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- The **baseline experience is light** and accessible to everyone.  \r\n- People who want depth and reflection have clear **opt-in pathways** that feel like sitting by a hearth, not filling out more admin.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.5 Optional seasonal SMS / WhatsApp check-ins (opt-in only)\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- At sign-up, members choose whether they want to receive seasonal reflections via SMS / WhatsApp / email.  \r\n- Each message is a short, human-feeling note, e.g.:\r\n\r\n> “Hearth check-in 🌱  \r\n> Where is your inner life right now?  \r\n> Reply with a number:  \r\n> 1 – Grounded & resourced  \r\n> 2 – Mostly okay, some edges  \r\n> 3 – Wobbly / stretched  \r\n> 4 – Overwhelmed / close to the edge  \r\n> 5 – I don’t know / prefer not to say”\r\n\r\n- Optional follow-up:  \r\n  > “If you’d like, reply with one short sentence about what’s most alive for you. You can also skip.”\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- Trials of simple **text-message / low-intensity digital interventions** show that gentle, periodic messages can support wellbeing and self-reflection, especially when they’re brief and easy to respond to, and not daily.  \r\n- Our use is even lighter: the messages are primarily **check-in + reflection**, not therapy in themselves.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- People get **moments of rememberedness** (“they checked on me”) without the pressure of a full program.  \r\n- The small time-series can gently update their profile and support self-understanding.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.6 Aggregated, not individual analytics (for trust)\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- Each person can see their **own** timeline and patterns.  \r\n- The Wellbeing Project team sees **aggregated patterns only** by default – e.g. by season, and optionally by broad region.  \r\n- Any use of individual-level data for outreach, matching, or research is **always opt-in and clearly communicated.**\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- Reviews of digital mental health tools highlight **privacy and surveillance concerns** as serious risks to trust, uptake, and long-term engagement.  \r\n- To support a “trust-fall” with the community, we’d rather err on the side of **under-using** data than over-using it.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- The app feels like a **supportive memory**, not a monitoring system.  \r\n- The Wellbeing Project can still sense the “temperature” of the field and adjust programming accordingly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. What the “Profile” Actually Is (in v1)\r\n\r\nPutting this together, a v1 profile for a person in the ecosystem looks like:\r\n\r\n1. **Presence & identity**\r\n   - Name, pronouns (optional), photo.\r\n   - City/region & time zone.\r\n   - Primary organisation & role.\r\n\r\n2. **Relational memory (embarrassment reduction)**\r\n   - Optional: partner name; kids; “people I’d love you to remember in my life.”  \r\n   - Who introduced me to the Wellbeing Project.  \r\n   - “Someone in this network who recently supported my wellbeing and how” (builds gratitude + network-weaver visibility).\r\n\r\n3. **Gifts / offers (resource-first)**\r\n   - 2–3 things I’d gladly offer in the next 6–12 months, e.g.:  \r\n     - “I can host an online circle about…”  \r\n     - “I can speak for an hour about…”  \r\n     - “I can help orient you in [place/context].”  \r\n   - Format (call, in-person, email) + typical length.\r\n\r\n4. **Current edges / needs**\r\n   - 1–2 short statements of what I’m exploring / struggling with in my wellbeing, and what support I might seek.\r\n\r\n5. **Ways-of-being constellation**\r\n   - A small set of statements under:\r\n     - “This feels lived in me now.”  \r\n     - “I’m growing into this.”  \r\n   - Some pre-curated (rest, boundaries, joy, receiving support, etc.), plus space to add my own.\r\n\r\n6. **Light time-series**\r\n   - Seasonal pulses stored in the background.  \r\n   - Visible to me as a simple “seasons wheel” or line over time; visible to the org only in aggregate.\r\n\r\n7. **Optional deeper layers**\r\n   - Hearth Letters, peer interviews, artifacts (photos, music, workshop notes) – all strictly opt-in and framed as rituals, not requirements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. How This Serves Aaron’s Original Pain Points\r\n\r\n**Aaron’s pain:**  \r\n> “I’m tired of always answering ‘Who do you know…?’ and being the bottleneck for finding therapists / practitioners / people.”\r\n\r\nHow the Hearth app helps:\r\n\r\n- **Self-serve, trusted directory**  \r\n  - Members can search for therapists, facilitators, and peers by modality, language, region, ways-of-being, and offers – without going through Aaron each time.\r\n\r\n- **Remembered relationships**  \r\n  - The app quietly remembers who introduced whom, who has helped whom, and who has capacity – so stewardship is shared across the network, not sitting on one person’s shoulders.\r\n\r\n- **Lightweight wellbeing sensing**  \r\n  - Seasonal pulses and simple analytics give the team an honest feel for how the ecosystem is doing, without a heavy research burden on participants.\r\n\r\n- **Aligned with research & values**  \r\n  - The design choices are backed by current wellbeing and measurement research, and deeply aligned with the Wellbeing Project’s emphasis on inner work, trust, and care.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6. Open Questions for the Team\r\n\r\nSome things we’ll still want to decide together:\r\n\r\n1. **Exact pulse rhythm**  \r\n   - 3 vs 4 pulses per year; aligning with event cycles or seasons.\r\n\r\n2. **Which rituals to pilot first**  \r\n   - Hearth Letter vs peer interviews vs artifacts – which is most realistic in year 1?\r\n\r\n3. **How “deep” the organisational analytics should go**  \r\n   - Start with seasonal aggregates and only later add regional breakdowns?\r\n\r\n4. **How this links to organisational assessments (e.g. Davidson’s work)**  \r\n   - Do we connect this layer loosely (e.g. through shared IDs) or tightly (e.g. integrated dashboards)?\r\n\r\nThis document is meant as a **starting point**: a way to show that the design is not random, but grounded in both **research** and **the hearth-like way of being** that the Wellbeing Project is inviting into the world.\r\n\"\"\")\r\n\r\npath = \"/mnt/data/wellbeing_hearth_rationale.md\"\r\nwith open(path, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\r\n    f.write(md)\r\n\r\npath",

Key Decisions & the Research Behind Them\r\n\r\nBelow are the main design decisions, each with a short “because research…” note.\r\n\r\n### 3.1 Seasonal micro check-ins (3–4 per year)\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- Members can **opt in** to receive short check-ins 3–4 times per year (via SMS, WhatsApp, or email).  \r\n- Each check-in is:\r\n  - 1 quick rating (e.g. “How resourced do you feel right now? 1–5”)  \r\n  - Optional one-sentence reflection (“What’s most alive in your inner life this season?”)\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- Research on **ecological momentary assessment (EMA)** and experience sampling shows that repeated, short assessments over time give a more realistic picture of wellbeing than big, one-off questionnaires – and are often better tolerated.  \r\n- Studies on **participant burden** in EMA consistently find that **questionnaire length** is more harmful than moderate frequency: one or two items is usually fine; long surveys drive people away.  \r\n- This matches our value of **paced realism** and keeps the check-ins feeling like a gift (“they remembered me”) rather than an exam.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- Each person gets a small **time-series** of how “resourced / stretched / overwhelmed” they feel across the year.  \r\n- The Wellbeing Project can (if desired and consented) see **aggregated seasonal patterns** (e.g. “many in the ecosystem feel ‘wobbly’ this season”), without looking at individual trajectories.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.2 Single-item or ultra-short scales (instead of big batteries)\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- Seasonal check-ins use **1 core item** plus 0–1 optional extra items.  \r\n- Example:  \r\n  - “Right now I feel…” (1–5, from “grounded & resourced” to “overwhelmed / close to the edge”).  \r\n  - Optional: “I feel I can access support if I need it” (agree–disagree).\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- Large, multi-sample studies show that **single-item life satisfaction and happiness measures** can be surprisingly reliable and valid, correlating strongly with longer scales and behaving similarly across time and countries.  \r\n- This means we can **keep questions tiny** and still have scientifically defensible signals for people like Richard Davidson’s team.  \r\n- Fewer items respects attention and aligns with EMA best practices.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- Very low friction: people can respond in seconds.  \r\n- We can still meaningfully talk about “changes in wellbeing” over time at both personal and aggregated levels.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.3 Few, spaced pulses instead of frequent tracking\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- Default: **3–4 pulses per year**, plus one gentle yearly profile refresh.  \r\n- No weekly nagging unless someone explicitly opts into a more intensive track.\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- Longitudinal wellbeing research shows that you can estimate *stable* aspects of wellbeing with **relatively few** repeated measures, as long as they’re not all taken in one emotional moment.  \r\n- Digital mental health studies also show that too many prompts and too much “homework” drive dropout; our population is already busy and highly committed elsewhere.  \r\n- We prefer **fewer, well-chosen touchpoints** that people actually engage with over years.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- People feel invited rather than harassed.  \r\n- The data are still rich enough to see personal and collective shifts over time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.4 Keep forms very short; put depth into optional rituals\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- Standard “profile” is intentionally simple:  \r\n  - Who you are (identity, region, time zone).  \r\n  - 2–3 **gifts / offers** you’d gladly give (e.g. “I can host a circle on X” or “I can talk your head off about Y”).  \r\n  - 1–2 **current edges / needs**.  \r\n  - A small **ways-of-being constellation** (“lived in me now” vs “growing into this”).  \r\n- Deeper engagement happens in **optional rituals**:  \r\n  - A yearly “Hearth Letter” (written or audio) for those who want it.  \r\n  - Peer interviews where someone else mirrors your gifts back to you.  \r\n  - Uploading photos or artifacts from gatherings.\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- EMA and burden studies show that **long questionnaires** are experienced as heavy and reduce participation and data quality more than modestly increased frequency does.  \r\n- Work comparing global, retrospective wellbeing reports to experiential or episode-based measures (e.g. Day Reconstruction Method) suggests that rich, narrative data are meaningful – but are best used as *occasional, intentional rituals*, not as standard intake for everyone.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- The **baseline experience is light** and accessible to everyone.  \r\n- People who want depth and reflection have clear **opt-in pathways** that feel like sitting by a hearth, not filling out more admin.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.5 Optional seasonal SMS / WhatsApp check-ins (opt-in only)\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- At sign-up, members choose whether they want to receive seasonal reflections via SMS / WhatsApp / email.  \r\n- Each message is a short, human-feeling note, e.g.:\r\n\r\n> “Hearth check-in 🌱  \r\n> Where is your inner life right now?  \r\n> Reply with a number:  \r\n> 1 – Grounded & resourced  \r\n> 2 – Mostly okay, some edges  \r\n> 3 – Wobbly / stretched  \r\n> 4 – Overwhelmed / close to the edge  \r\n> 5 – I don’t know / prefer not to say”\r\n\r\n- Optional follow-up:  \r\n  > “If you’d like, reply with one short sentence about what’s most alive for you. You can also skip.”\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- Trials of simple **text-message / low-intensity digital interventions** show that gentle, periodic messages can support wellbeing and self-reflection, especially when they’re brief and easy to respond to, and not daily.  \r\n- Our use is even lighter: the messages are primarily **check-in + reflection**, not therapy in themselves.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- People get **moments of rememberedness** (“they checked on me”) without the pressure of a full program.  \r\n- The small time-series can gently update their profile and support self-understanding.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.6 Aggregated, not individual analytics (for trust)\r\n\r\n**Design**  \r\n- Each person can see their **own** timeline and patterns.  \r\n- The Wellbeing Project team sees **aggregated patterns only** by default – e.g. by season, and optionally by broad region.  \r\n- Any use of individual-level data for outreach, matching, or research is **always opt-in and clearly communicated.**\r\n\r\n**Why we’re doing this**  \r\n- Reviews of digital mental health tools highlight **privacy and surveillance concerns** as serious risks to trust, uptake, and long-term engagement.  \r\n- To support a “trust-fall” with the community, we’d rather err on the side of **under-using** data than over-using it.\r\n\r\n**What this enables**  \r\n- The app feels like a **supportive memory**, not a monitoring system.  \r\n- The Wellbeing Project can still sense the “temperature” of the field and adjust programming accordingly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. What the “Profile” Actually Is (in v1)\r\n\r\nPutting this together, a v1 profile for a person in the ecosystem looks like:\r\n\r\n1. **Presence & identity**\r\n   - Name, pronouns (optional), photo.\r\n   - City/region & time zone.\r\n   - Primary organisation & role.\r\n\r\n2. **Relational memory (embarrassment reduction)**\r\n   - Optional: partner name; kids; “people I’d love you to remember in my life.”  \r\n   - Who introduced me to the Wellbeing Project.  \r\n   - “Someone in this network who recently supported my wellbeing and how” (builds gratitude + network-weaver visibility).\r\n\r\n3. **Gifts / offers (resource-first)**\r\n   - 2–3 things I’d gladly offer in the next 6–12 months, e.g.:  \r\n     - “I can host an online circle about…”  \r\n     - “I can speak for an hour about…”  \r\n     - “I can help orient you in [place/context].”  \r\n   - Format (call, in-person, email) + typical length.\r\n\r\n4. **Current edges / needs**\r\n   - 1–2 short statements of what I’m exploring / struggling with in my wellbeing, and what support I might seek.\r\n\r\n5. **Ways-of-being constellation**\r\n   - A small set of statements under:\r\n     - “This feels lived in me now.”  \r\n     - “I’m growing into this.”  \r\n   - Some pre-curated (rest, boundaries, joy, receiving support, etc.), plus space to add my own.\r\n\r\n6. **Light time-series**\r\n   - Seasonal pulses stored in the background.  \r\n   - Visible to me as a simple “seasons wheel” or line over time; visible to the org only in aggregate.\r\n\r\n7. **Optional deeper layers**\r\n   - Hearth Letters, peer interviews, artifacts (photos, music, workshop notes) – all strictly opt-in and framed as rituals, not requirements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. How This Serves Aaron’s Original Pain Points\r\n\r\n**Aaron’s pain:**  \r\n> “I’m tired of always answering ‘Who do you know…?’ and being the bottleneck for finding therapists / practitioners / people.”\r\n\r\nHow the Hearth app helps:\r\n\r\n- **Self-serve, trusted directory**  \r\n  - Members can search for therapists, facilitators, and peers by modality, language, region, ways-of-being, and offers – without going through Aaron each time.\r\n\r\n- **Remembered relationships**  \r\n  - The app quietly remembers who introduced whom, who has helped whom, and who has capacity – so stewardship is shared across the network, not sitting on one person’s shoulders.\r\n\r\n- **Lightweight wellbeing sensing**  \r\n  - Seasonal pulses and simple analytics give the team an honest feel for how the ecosystem is doing, without a heavy research burden on participants.\r\n\r\n- **Aligned with research & values**  \r\n  - The design choices are backed by current wellbeing and measurement research, and deeply aligned with the Wellbeing Project’s emphasis on inner work, trust, and care.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6. Open Questions for the Team\r\n\r\nSome things we’ll still want to decide together:\r\n\r\n1. **Exact pulse rhythm**  \r\n   - 3 vs 4 pulses per year; aligning with event cycles or seasons.\r\n\r\n2. **Which rituals to pilot first**  \r\n   - Hearth Letter vs peer interviews vs artifacts – which is most realistic in year 1?\r\n\r\n3. **How “deep” the organisational analytics should go**  \r\n   - Start with seasonal aggregates and only later add regional breakdowns?\r\n\r\n4. **How this links to organisational assessments (e.g. Davidson’s work)**  \r\n   - Do we connect this layer loosely (e.g. through shared IDs) or tightly (e.g. integrated dashboards)?\r\n\r\nThis document is meant as a **starting point**: a way to show that the design is not random, but grounded in both **research** and **the hearth-like way of being** that the Wellbeing Project is inviting into the world.\r\n\"\"\")\r\n\r\npath = \"/mnt/data/wellbeing_hearth_rationale.md\"\r\nwith open(path, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\r\n    f.write(md)\r\n\r\npath",

      "content": "Totally, 20 minutes needs a **one-pager** you can *talk through*, not a literature review.\n\nHere’s a **shorter markdown version** you can copy-paste and share:\n\n```markdown\n# Wellbeing Project “Hearth” App – One-Pager (v0.1)\n\n## 1. What this is (in one sentence)\n\nA **trusted resource layer** for the Wellbeing Project – a place people go when they need support, not a new social platform.\n\n> “A quiet memory and matchmaking layer for the ecosystem – a hearth, not a dashboard.”\n\n---\n\n## 2. The pain we’re solving\n\n- Aaron & team are a **bottleneck** for “Who do you know…?” questions (therapists, facilitators, etc.).\n- A lot of the ecosystem’s **gifts & relationships are invisible** or stuck in WhatsApp / memory.\n- Heavy forms or platforms won’t work – people are already stretched.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Core design principles\n\n- **Generosity over extraction** – profiles as gifts (offers, stories, connections), not data mining.\n- **Resource, not platform** – this doesn’t replace WhatsApp or gatherings; it helps route people to the right humans.\n- **Paced & realistic** – tiny, meaningful touchpoints instead of big one-off surveys.\n- **Trust-fall friendly** – people should feel “this thing has my back,” not “this thing is watching me.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key design moves (evidence-aligned, but simple)\n\n1. **Seasonal micro check-ins (3–4 per year, opt-in)**  \n   - 1 quick “How resourced do you feel right now? (1–5)” + optional one-line reflection.  \n   - Gives a light time-series per person and a seasonal “temperature read” for the ecosystem.\n\n2. **Single-item / ultra-short questions**  \n   - We use 1–2 questions per pulse (not long scales).  \n   - Research shows single-item wellbeing measures can be valid and reliable, especially when repeated over time.\n\n3. **Very short profiles; depth is optional**  \n   - Standard profile = identity, 2–3 **offers**, 1–2 **current edges/needs**, a small **ways-of-being** constellation.  \n   - Optional deeper rituals: Hearth Letter, peer interview, photos/artifacts from gatherings.\n\n4. **Aggregated analytics, not surveillance**  \n   - Individuals see their own patterns.  \n   - The team sees seasonal trends in aggregate (e.g. “more people feel wobbly this winter”), not individual dashboards.\n\n---\n\n## 5. What a v1 profile contains\n\n- **Presence & identity**\n  - Name, org, role, region & time zone, photo (optional).\n\n- **Relational memory (to reduce awkwardness)**\n  - Who introduced me to the Wellbeing Project.  \n  - Optional: partner, kids, “people I’d love you to remember in my life.”  \n  - “Someone in this network who recently supported my wellbeing and how.”\n\n- **Gifts / offers (resource-first)**\n  - 2–3 things I’d gladly offer in the next 6–12 months:  \n    - e.g. “Host an online circle on X,” “Talk for an hour about Y,” “Help orient you in [place].”\n\n- **Current edges / needs**\n  - 1–2 short statements of what I’m wrestling with and what kind of support I might seek.\n\n- **Ways-of-being**\n  - A few statements split between:\n    - “Lived in me now”  \n    - “I’m growing into this”\n\n- **Light time-series (in the background)**\n  - Seasonal pulses stored and shown back to the person as a simple trend; aggregate view only for the team.\n\n---\n\n## 6. How this helps Aaron concretely\n\n- People can **self-serve** to find therapists, facilitators, peers and hosts by modality, language, region, and offers.  \n- The system quietly remembers **who is connected to whom** and who has capacity, so Aaron isn’t the human router for everything.  \n- Seasonal pulses give a gentle, honest sense of how the field is doing, without heavy data collection or asking too much from anyone.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Things we need to decide together\n\n1. **Rhythm:** 3 vs 4 seasonal pulses per year (tie to event cycles or to literal seasons?).  \n2. **Rituals v1:** Do we pilot Hearth Letters, peer interviews, or artifacts first (what’s realistic in year 1)?  \n3. **Analytics depth:** Start with only global seasonal trends, or also by broad region (e.g. Americas / Europe / MENA)?  \n4. **Integration:** How tightly (if at all) should this connect to any organisational wellbeing assessments (e.g. Davidson’s work)?\n\n```\n\nYou can basically:\n\n- Open with sections **1–2** (2–3 minutes).  \n- Walk through **4–5** as “what the app actually does & looks like” (10–12 minutes).  \n- Land with **7** as “these are the choices I’d love your input on” (last 5 minutes).\n\nIf you want, I can also give you a 3–4 sentence *spoken* opener you can memorize for the call.",

Speaker B: El nuno.\n00:36 Speaker B: How is it Frenchified.\n00:39 Speaker A: Now?\n00:40 Speaker A: Like, I've got both swirling in my head.\n00:41 Speaker A: Let's let it go.\n00:42 Speaker A: But it was just interesting hearing, like, the big thing.\n00:45 Speaker A: Very cool.\n00:46 Speaker B: How old are you guys?\n00:48 Speaker B: We're early in Mexico, I'm assuming.\n00:50 Speaker B: Or.\n00:54 Speaker C: No, it's midday.\n00:55 Speaker C: Almost 12 in Mexico, so my day has fully started.\n01:01 Speaker C: I feel kind of tired right now, but good.\n01:06 Speaker C: I'm doing good.\n01:11 Speaker B: And you are?\n01:12 Speaker A: I'm doing well.\n01:13 Speaker A: It's closer to the end of the day here in Paris.\n01:16 Speaker A: It's very dark.\n01:17 Speaker A: Like, I think it's probably as dark as it is where you are.\n01:21 Speaker A: And it's Friday, and I'm looking forward to, like, closing things up.\n01:25 Speaker A: I have one more call after this, and then it's the weekend, and I'm excited about that.\n01:32 Speaker A: So I'm in.\n01:36 Speaker A: Bilal, do you want to check on in?\n01:38 Speaker B: Yeah.\n01:39 Speaker B: So, yeah, I'm feeling a little, like, excited, a little wired and in need of grounding, but also, yeah, happy to.\n01:55 Speaker B: To find a way of, like, taking that energy and hopefully moving into the conversation in a generative way.\n02:01 Speaker B: And, yeah, just a little bit excited, but needing maybe at least one deep breath.\n02:08 Speaker B: Alhamdulillah.\n02:10 Speaker A: I love how you said that with maniacal laughter.\n02:12 Speaker A: Fantastic.\n02:13 Speaker B: At least one deep.\n02:14 Speaker A: At least one deep breath.\n02:16 Speaker A: Let me see if I can take us into this conversation.\n02:19 Speaker A: I know we have a short time today.\n02:20 Speaker A: I apologize for that.\n02:21 Speaker A: It's just been a bit tighter than usual.\n02:24 Speaker A: But, Bilal, we're in a place where we're trying to find a way that we can have a little pilot put together of this registry project that we've been thinking about.\n02:35 Speaker A: We're still trying to find a word for it, like, a unique word for it.\n02:39 Speaker A: I think you had one which was like, springboard.\n02:44 Speaker A: Bilal thought that Ali could work as an interesting way of describing what we're doing.\n02:49 Speaker A: It's not a platform.\n02:50 Speaker A: It's a springboard.\n02:51 Speaker A: You come there so you can spring off and do something else better.\n02:57 Speaker A: But we want to kind of put together a pilot.\n03:00 Speaker A: We've been offered technology by these people that had designed and put in place the infrastructure for India ID system, like for a billion people for registry in that case, which you can imagine is pretty hardcore technology.\n03:14 Speaker A: We don't need something like that big and insane, even though they're making it available for free.\n03:20 Speaker A: We need something that's much more down to earth.\n03:22 Speaker A: But the reality is we also need something that's safe and secure because the kind of people that are tuning into this are people that sometimes don't want people to know they're tuning into those kinds of things that are sharing information that they don't want to share.\n03:34 Speaker A: So eventually we're going to need a secure system.\n03:36 Speaker A: And so this can't just be like, you know, you're off the shelf kind of thing.\n03:40 Speaker A: But for a pilot, maybe we can start and come up with something that allows us to test.\n03:45 Speaker A: If we send out a survey to 30 organizations and ask them for specific information and it becomes their price of entry into the network and they all share the names of coaches and therapists.\n03:55 Speaker A: Like, does that start to build up a reservoir?\n03:57 Speaker A: Like, how would we design it?\n03:58 Speaker A: How would they use it?\n04:00 Speaker A: What needs to be there in place for that?\n04:01 Speaker A: Like, if we ask about research they've done, can they share that research so that way we can actually track and maybe some of it can be shared publicly or within the group at least.\n04:12 Speaker A: Are there like, Is there like we have a survey tool?\n04:15 Speaker A: Can we help them deploy that tool?\n04:17 Speaker A: Like, you know, like these are sort of like three use cases that I think that we've been thinking about.\n04:22 Speaker A: And so can we are like gathering.\n04:25 Speaker B: People'S research that they're already doing with their communities, conducting our research with the work that you were describing that you're working on with Richie essentially and deploying that.\n04:37 Speaker B: And then the registry for needs services offers things that they know are high quality.\n04:44 Speaker B: So were those the three?\n04:46 Speaker A: Yeah, the, the research that we're doing.\n04:48 Speaker A: It's more like they want, like everyone keeps asking us for a survey tool that they can deploy that that will be validated.\n04:56 Speaker B: Yeah.\n04:57 Speaker A: And so we want to like make available a survey tool that they can fill out that can then be compared to a baseline with the rest of the sector.\n05:05 Speaker A: So that's kind of the idea.\n05:07 Speaker A: But somehow we were able to give them a tool they can deploy it.\n05:09 Speaker A: Say like, here's a link.\n05:10 Speaker A: It gives them like something that is helpful for them, but also contributes to a larger pool of data.\n05:16 Speaker A: So we can start to develop a baseline for the sector.\n05:18 Speaker C: Too different from Richie's state of Obeam report.\n05:24 Speaker A: Maybe the two, like, one creates the baseline for the other.\n05:28 Speaker A: Maybe when we like, maybe we use the same survey that we develop with Ritchie and that's the survey that we deploy, that we make available.\n05:35 Speaker A: And then people can just keep comparing it to an evolving baseline that we have for the field through our platform.\n05:47 Speaker B: So short period of time and so many questions.\n05:50 Speaker B: But in terms of security and like risks, when you mean it needs to be secure, do you mean it needs a login?\n05:57 Speaker B: Or do you mean it needs to be hardened?\n05:59 Speaker B: Like hiring white hat hackers to try to break in?\n06:03 Speaker B: Like, what kind of security risks are you imagining?\n06:07 Speaker B: And just generally like, what are you looking for in terms of.\n06:10 Speaker B: At least for the pilot, I know you could, you could take it as far as you want.\n06:15 Speaker B: Like, do you want it like PGP key encrypted, we know exactly who sent what, or do you just want it to have logins basically, or you're muted?\n06:26 Speaker A: I think there are two things that I feel concerned about.\n06:28 Speaker A: One is there are people working on the front lines of a lot of different things.\n06:32 Speaker A: There are state actors and other actors who want to know who they are and information about them.\n06:39 Speaker A: Information that they might be sharing or that their organizations might have shared about burnout.\n06:46 Speaker A: If a government actor knows that a body that they're really worried about is completely burned out, they might not worry as much because they're like, these people are on the point of like breaking down anyways.\n06:56 Speaker A: There's data like this that could be used like at an organizational level.\n07:00 Speaker A: There's data like that about individuals sharing who they might be working with personally as a coach that they might recommend.\n07:06 Speaker A: That could create risk for them.\n07:09 Speaker A: At an individual or organizational level, there's another risk which is a systemic risk for this movement.\n07:15 Speaker A: If they have a cluster where they can see literally in one place all the actors that are leading this, that's a risk as well.\n07:23 Speaker A: So what I mean by this is hardened because we don't want any of that to become easily like taken by a government and absolutely everybody in the.\n07:34 Speaker B: Ecosystem to not take screenshots or download, you know, things and share them.\n07:41 Speaker B: And it makes it like there's a big community to have to trust.\n07:46 Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely everyone.\n07:47 Speaker A: No.\n07:47 Speaker A: And yeah.\n07:48 Speaker A: And I think there's a part there where at some basic level there's trust, but there's information.\n07:54 Speaker A: No one should normally be able to get access to another organization's well being reports, but a government act get that.\n08:02 Speaker A: Or being able to see the identities of the people who represent each organization.\n08:06 Speaker A: Normally what I'm thinking about with the registry is that you get a login as an organization, but you're not logging in as an individual, you're logging in as an organization.\n08:15 Speaker A: So that way it should not be that visible who the people are, except if you can access the information behind it to see who that is.\n08:25 Speaker A: Right.\n08:26 Speaker A: Like there's a bunch of stuff like that where.\n08:30 Speaker A: But that might be for a second round.\n08:32 Speaker A: Bilal.\n08:33 Speaker B: Yeah, the first like just thinking about logging in as an organization but also wanting to have a personal profile where people are recommending.\n08:41 Speaker B: And then we were talking about the importance of being able to meet and connect and like know someone and know that this was referred by someone and that information kind of goes against like this process that you described.\n08:52 Speaker A: Well, it could be a coach or a therapist recommended by an organization.\n08:56 Speaker A: Right.\n08:56 Speaker A: Someone that an organization has worked with.\n08:59 Speaker A: Now let's go with simple.\n09:01 Speaker A: In the first scenario, let's say simple is like a pilot of 30 organizations.\n09:05 Speaker A: Yeah.\n09:06 Speaker B: Keep it.\n09:06 Speaker A: Everyone's okay and everyone's okay with information being shared.\n09:11 Speaker A: Let's take it as a bit of a garden to experiment with and say like, what would this look like if it was working?\n09:17 Speaker B: I didn't think about a lot of these challenges because a lot of the.\n09:20 Speaker B: I had some really silly ideas including, you know, you don't actually fill in your own survey.\n09:27 Speaker B: Everything is done through like a peer process so that there's relationships being forged.\n09:31 Speaker B: I've been, I was trying to think about like the values about anyway, so a lot of these things are going to get thrown out the window once I'm.\n09:38 Speaker B: I learn more about the, the vision.\n09:40 Speaker B: So I'm glad you're sharing some of these things.\n09:42 Speaker B: I'm curious.\n09:43 Speaker B: We don't have a lot of time but ale, like, what are your thoughts on what Aaron is sharing and your hopes for what this thing can be?\n09:53 Speaker B: I'm curious.\n09:58 Speaker C: I wish this pilot, I think like something that happened with the other developers we were trying to launch this with was that the interface was not as user friendly, was very like old.\n10:15 Speaker C: And so my worry was that during the pilot the users would get stuck in that the interface was not easy to use.\n10:22 Speaker C: Instead of really testing what we want to test that the platform is a good resource for them.\n10:29 Speaker C: No, a valuable resource.\n10:31 Speaker C: So I would say that's something to consider too.\n10:33 Speaker C: And I know that for a pilot you cannot invest as much because it's a pilot.\n10:37 Speaker C: But then how do we do it?\n10:38 Speaker C: The other one was like really, really old.\n10:40 Speaker A: Yeah.\n10:41 Speaker B: When you say valuable resource, how does it feel for someone using the resource?\n10:45 Speaker B: Or like what are they getting access to.\n10:51 Speaker C: Information contacts, like information that they know is backed up by someone else.\n10:57 Speaker C: Because someone else in the community put it there?\n10:58 Speaker C: No, because it was valuable for them.\n11:00 Speaker C: And then contacts where therapists, coaches, other people have already worked with to make it easy to gain access to this network of coaches and information.\n11:13 Speaker B: So I keep hearing this idea of the network of coaches and Aaron has mentioned before that this is a very common request.\n11:19 Speaker B: What's the second most common request that you're hoping that this platform can facilitate?\n11:30 Speaker B: Beyond therapists, I don't know where the.\n11:31 Speaker C: First one is, the coaches, but access to information like the research articles, courses, that repository of information.\n11:45 Speaker B: Is there anything about like a calendar of events or activities or anything like that?\n11:50 Speaker B: I, I know we're expecting people to fill it in once, but maybe they have, you know, their yearly event that they want people to know about or something.\n11:56 Speaker B: Is that something that might be helpful?\n12:00 Speaker A: I think, I think it might be interesting with some of the organizations to ask them if they have specific offerings for change makers well being that are open to a broader group and that might be more a quarterly update thing that we ask them like.\n12:14 Speaker A: So there's like a Big Year survey and there's a small survey that.\n12:17 Speaker A: That's a really cool question.\n12:20 Speaker B: I was wondering about this like seasonal connection.\n12:23 Speaker B: I was thinking about, you know, a yearly onboarding and I was wondering did you want that to be connected to any moment for the organization?\n12:31 Speaker B: Like connected to the heart summit perhaps or like the big event?\n12:35 Speaker B: Or do you have a vision for the soft launch and then when you want might want to like launch it more publicly?\n12:41 Speaker B: Do you have a date for that?\n12:45 Speaker A: I think we need to first do a pilot, see what we learn and experiment.\n12:50 Speaker A: I think once we've experimented then we can think about this as a bit of a broader thing.\n12:55 Speaker A: But I think there's a part here where I think the word springboard is important because like that sort of design of a springboard is something very.\n13:03 Speaker A: It's relatively simple but the impact is big.\n13:07 Speaker A: And it's one time access right until you climb up and go back up because you want to really do something again.\n13:13 Speaker A: And so it's not a platform.\n13:15 Speaker A: And so let's, let's discover.\n13:19 Speaker A: I think that's the place that I'm at right now.\n13:21 Speaker A: Instead of going saying let's go like fast big, let's pilot.\n13:25 Speaker A: And Maybe it's even 10 organizations that we know are the 10 most likely organizations that are willing to collaborate with us, then we do 30 and see what like we get from there.\n13:36 Speaker B: And this Might not even like be relevant for a while.\n13:41 Speaker B: But with the.\n13:43 Speaker B: There's the research sharing, which can be a generic kind of sharing thing with the tagging or whatever, but like sharing PDFs, sharing documents and we want people to share their research.\n13:55 Speaker B: There's the conducting the research with an assessment, but there's the possibility of designing the tool to be able to conduct assessments.\n14:05 Speaker B: So maybe V1 of Richie's thing.\n14:08 Speaker B: Or do you want people to be able to actually create like lists of questions with likert scales or choosing scales and actually be able to conduct the research through the platform itself itself, or is that taking it too far and making it something that it shouldn't be?\n14:22 Speaker A: Let's find out.\n14:23 Speaker A: I think for now let's start simple and then let's iterate from there.\n14:26 Speaker A: Right.\n14:27 Speaker A: Like, I think the thing is like once we see how people tune in, like how we can make this something that people are responsive to and where there's value that's being created, like a springboard's value is really, really clear.\n14:38 Speaker A: I like, I think we want to avoid this being a platform, I think we want to avoid this being an iPhone.\n14:43 Speaker A: But like where it's clearly like the community creating value for itself.\n14:47 Speaker B: Yeah.\n14:48 Speaker A: That the community can tap into whenever they need.\n14:50 Speaker B: The last question, I mean I have actually a big list, but the last question for our time together right now.\n14:56 Speaker A: Is do you guys want to, do you guys want to continue?\n15:01 Speaker A: Because you guys can absolutely continue as well.\n15:04 Speaker B: I need to feed the baby and stuff too.\n15:06 Speaker B: Like Joe's there and she's by herself right now.\n15:09 Speaker B: But the question is about security and do we want to give people the option to share more or less publicly and just give people this gradation or should we try to make it as thinking for people about risks that they're not aware about and making it more closed?\n15:26 Speaker A: Thinking about it for people I think will be the kind of way to go with this.\n15:32 Speaker B: Okay.\n15:33 Speaker B: Yeah.\n15:34 Speaker B: And Ale, if you have any like thoughts or you know, you were mentioning the importance of the, the usability and making it look modern, thankfully that is hopefully going to be easier.\n15:50 Speaker B: Like I starting fresh means that we can start with like a bunch of very modern tool stacks that will, you know, create very common tropes for user experience that are very well known and validated.\n16:08 Speaker B: Like the team that you guys were working with probably built everything about their UI and their UX processes and so it looks old but thankfully starting from scratch means that we can leverage a lot of modern day best practices tailwind, like just things that you don't have to think about anymore.\n16:25 Speaker B: But beyond the usability, I'm curious.\n16:29 Speaker B: Aaron, you can head out.\n16:30 Speaker B: I know you have your next meeting.\n16:32 Speaker A: But I'm a little concerned about the link.\n16:35 Speaker A: Ali, do you have a link that you could share with Bilal?\n16:38 Speaker B: A link?\n16:39 Speaker B: Oh, this Zoom link.\n16:41 Speaker A: I see.\n16:42 Speaker A: Yeah.\n16:42 Speaker A: Because I'm supposed to open another call.\n16:43 Speaker A: I don't want you guys to disappear, so.\n16:50 Speaker B: Yeah.\n16:51 Speaker B: All right, I'll hop on there and hopefully I'll get just like to hear a little bit more from you of some of the challenges that you saw, some of the things that you'd be like.\n16:58 Speaker B: It'll be so cool if you.\n16:59 Speaker B: And then we'll take it from there.\n17:01 Speaker B: Inshallah.\n17:01 Speaker B: Yallah, yallah.\n17:02 Speaker B: Aaron, I'll be on the Zoom.\n17:07 Speaker B: This other Zoom here.\n17:09 Speaker B: How do we go here?\n17:29 Speaker B: All right.\n17:32 Speaker A: Yeah.\n17:33 Speaker C: There's something that came to mind that I didn't mention.\n17:36 Speaker C: We didn't mention in this chat.\n17:37 Speaker C: We were also evaluating an AI component.\n17:41 Speaker B: Yeah.\n17:42 Speaker C: In the beginning, it was an AI bot bed with resources on, well, being for social change.\n17:52 Speaker C: And then you could ask questions to it.\n17:55 Speaker C: And then the idea was, why isn't this bot, like, embedded to the platform as a supporter or maybe, maybe even in the search bar so that it can answer your questions.\n18:07 Speaker C: If you.\n18:09 Speaker C: About this topic.\n18:10 Speaker C: Here are these coaches, these resources.\n18:13 Speaker C: We even launched this survey.\n18:14 Speaker C: I don't know, like, you get all the answers.\n18:17 Speaker B: Yeah.\n18:18 Speaker B: So I've been actually working with something called rag retrievement, augmented generation.\n18:27 Speaker B: Basically, you give it your source material and then instead of just having an AI talking to a black box, it's talking to the data, and then it can actually bring in direct links and references to the data set.\n18:46 Speaker B: So if the data set has coaches and things like that, you can say, where are the coaches that are in North Carolina?\n18:52 Speaker B: And if there are any, reference them and link them.\n18:55 Speaker B: So it's like aiding the search.\n19:00 Speaker B: I did talk with Aaron a little bit about AI because in terms of usability, I'm developing systems for extracting structured data from conversations with probability measures.\n19:14 Speaker B: So instead of having people go and fill in like this and fill in that very much like me, not like me, or, you know, this is where I live.\n19:22 Speaker B: It would just talk and.\n19:24 Speaker B: Or they would.\n19:24 Speaker B: I was thinking, like, how cool would it be if this thing was a reflective moment?\n19:28 Speaker B: You know, we've done so many of our processes together where we're journaling for a while.\n19:33 Speaker B: Right.\n19:33 Speaker B: And we talked about, like, where we see ourselves in the future.\n19:36 Speaker B: And then we like, what if we Actually use that stuff and then with their validation.\n19:42 Speaker B: Right.\n19:43 Speaker B: Structure it and say, we're going to fill in your user profile.\n19:46 Speaker B: Here's the information we're able to extract.\n19:49 Speaker B: Do you want to edit it?\n19:51 Speaker B: Keep keeping your own words, but just like chopping it up and then filling in the profile before they hit submit.\n19:57 Speaker B: So it's not like they have to sit and then become a machine to talk to a machine, which is what forms require.\n20:03 Speaker B: But Aaron didn't recommend that so much.\n20:05 Speaker B: He was.\n20:05 Speaker B: For some reason I had some concerns.\n20:08 Speaker B: So I kind of put the AI stuff to the side.\n20:11 Speaker B: But I think the AI as a search is, is.\n20:14 Speaker B: Is good.\n20:16 Speaker B: Even though filters are probably just as good.\n20:18 Speaker B: Like there's a.\n20:19 Speaker B: There's a question of like, what is the real utility, you know, versus, like just if it was structured data, well represented inside, you could just say North Carolina, you know, referenced by this organization, you know, by two filters and they just use databases.\n20:36 Speaker B: There's.\n20:37 Speaker B: I'm not sure what the benefit of the AI would be if it's just using the search.\n20:43 Speaker B: If it's about, like conversation, it might be interesting.\n20:47 Speaker B: Here's where it could get actually really interesting.\n20:49 Speaker B: Not for the search, not for the directory, but for the research.\n20:52 Speaker B: We have all these PDFs that have been generated over the years.\n20:57 Speaker B: And how do you know what part is interesting for you?\n21:01 Speaker B: Like what if you have a question?\n21:04 Speaker B: And that could be really interesting to create a rag retrievement augmented generation.\n21:10 Speaker B: Because instead of just giving you an answer and then you having to trust this AI, it says, well, here's the answer and then here's the reference.\n21:17 Speaker B: It's on page four of this PDF.\n21:19 Speaker B: And then you can actually like navigate deep into the research rather than needing to read the whole thing or it would tell you where to go, basically.\n21:28 Speaker B: So that would be something pretty cool.\n21:30 Speaker B: It does turn the app into something more.\n21:32 Speaker B: Right.\n21:33 Speaker B: It's.\n21:33 Speaker B: It's not just a directory now, so we would need to think about what is it really.\n21:38 Speaker C: And I think like we started calling it Registry, but in the end we don't want it to be a directory of the people using it.\n21:46 Speaker C: It might be a directory of coaches, but.\n21:52 Speaker C: Yeah, and another thing that's come up is like, we really want to be careful that this is not another social network.\n22:00 Speaker C: We don't want that in chat, like between users or.\n22:04 Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, but do you want people to be able to connect with each other, like find their email addresses or.\n22:12 Speaker C: No, no, just connect to the coaches.\n22:15 Speaker B: Interesting.\n22:19 Speaker B: Yeah, so that, that's a little, you know, a Little different than I was thinking, because at least when I was talking with Aaron, I thought, you know, part of it was being able to know who shared.\n22:30 Speaker B: But I'm seeing even more now.\n22:31 Speaker B: It's like organizations that are, you know, have people inside of it that are sharing, but we're obscuring through a layer of organization.\n22:46 Speaker C: And then there might be users who are coaches or experts on things, and they want to put their profiles up and provide that support.\n22:57 Speaker C: So there can be the case where a user is also on the platform as a.\n23:01 Speaker C: As an expert.\n23:02 Speaker B: That's interesting.\n23:03 Speaker B: So maybe the service providers.\n23:07 Speaker B: Basically, when somebody recommends somebody, there's a service provider profile produced, like, in the system that someone could then log into.\n23:21 Speaker B: Right.\n23:22 Speaker B: And they could connect it with their actual email and all that, and they can actually find bookings or connect with people, but only they would have a user profile.\n23:31 Speaker B: Everyone else has an organizational profile logged in with their user, but they're kind of inside of this cluster of organization.\n23:41 Speaker C: So I think that's something we need to test, too.\n23:44 Speaker C: Like, is it enough just to find the information of the coach here and then you reach out to them.\n23:49 Speaker C: Them separately, like outside of the platform, or does it need to be in the platform?\n23:55 Speaker C: It was something we talked with the guys in India about, too, because the model, like, it was a white label of something they had.\n24:02 Speaker C: And what the software that they were offering encouraged users to book the session with coaches in the platform.\n24:11 Speaker C: And then it did become like a social network.\n24:13 Speaker C: And they were chatting, and then the thing of payments came up.\n24:17 Speaker B: And so these are things that you don't want.\n24:20 Speaker B: You don't want people to be discussing and negotiating or anything like that.\n24:26 Speaker C: No.\n24:26 Speaker C: And we're not processing payments either.\n24:30 Speaker B: Okay.\n24:31 Speaker B: It's interesting because it is like a. I think it needs some more definition.\n24:37 Speaker B: It's still me, too, because.\n24:40 Speaker C: Because this is the problem.\n24:41 Speaker B: You're also talking to someone who's very creative, Right.\n24:43 Speaker B: And you could say, can we do this?\n24:45 Speaker B: I'm like, yeah.\n24:45 Speaker B: And then I could think of, like, 10 ways to do it.\n24:47 Speaker B: And technology is like that, Right?\n24:49 Speaker B: Like, there's always a way.\n24:52 Speaker B: So we need a list of what we're not going to do.\n24:54 Speaker B: You know, I think that would be really interesting.\n24:57 Speaker B: And then it could really define it.\n24:59 Speaker B: It's sort of like, what is it?\n25:01 Speaker B: Michelangelo?\n25:01 Speaker B: He's like, I just.\n25:03 Speaker B: The sculpture was in the stone.\n25:05 Speaker B: I just removed all the parts that didn't belong.\n25:07 Speaker B: You know, we need to remove all the parts that don't belong to see what this thing is.\n25:11 Speaker B: And Aaron has mentioned over and over actually since the beginning that he wants a pilot to explore.\n25:15 Speaker B: But even before, like the pilot, I think we need to just have some clear like no's.\n25:20 Speaker B: And I think there's some clear ones already.\n25:21 Speaker B: Which is not a social media platform.\n25:25 Speaker B: No direct communication, no even the ability to see who is in organizations.\n25:31 Speaker B: Is that true?\n25:32 Speaker B: Just like from outside, like you can see who's in your organization.\n25:35 Speaker A: Sure.\n25:36 Speaker B: If you have an organization, you can say, you can see the list of people in it and who's logged in recently, who filled in the well being assessment or not.\n25:43 Speaker B: But between organizations.\n25:45 Speaker B: No, like something like that.\n25:47 Speaker C: And it's something that I'm also curious to see how people react to this.\n25:52 Speaker C: Because for example, in when and in other networks that we have in the Wellbeing project, people want to know each other.\n25:58 Speaker C: Who's here?\n26:00 Speaker B: You should see my brainstorming, my whole brainstorming was about, I'll give you some of the principles and values that I had been developing.\n26:07 Speaker B: It's like the hearth, the connecting people remembering relationships, connecting to each other.\n26:16 Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.\n26:16 Speaker B: Like these kinds of things and it's, it's different.\n26:19 Speaker B: And I understand the, the rigor and the need to sort of protect people and even protect maybe the organization from kind of opening up a can of worms.\n26:29 Speaker B: Maybe.\n26:30 Speaker B: But they already have the whatsapps, you know, like the, the can has been opened.\n26:37 Speaker C: Yeah.\n26:40 Speaker B: Yeah.\n26:40 Speaker B: And it's a phone number.\n26:41 Speaker C: Something else that I'm thinking of is like what happens when people leave organizations.\n26:48 Speaker C: We don't want this knowledge that's already in this hub or this springboard to leave with them.\n26:54 Speaker C: The organization is still a member.\n26:57 Speaker B: So that's interesting.\n26:58 Speaker B: We need something that isn't even like an email registration.\n27:04 Speaker B: We need something.\n27:07 Speaker B: This is gonna sound weird but like we might need people's organizational paperwork instead of a username and password.\n27:16 Speaker B: Something that is consistent no matter who is within the structure.\n27:23 Speaker B: Right.\n27:23 Speaker B: Like emails will come and go even.\n27:27 Speaker B: Not everyone has a@wellbeingprojects.org email.\n27:32 Speaker B: Right.\n27:32 Speaker B: Like if some organizations might still not have the technical competence for that, they, they just have Gmail addresses.\n27:38 Speaker A: Right.\n27:39 Speaker C: So.\n27:41 Speaker B: What, what defines an organization that's in a consistent way?\n27:45 Speaker B: Maybe there's a handoff.\n27:47 Speaker B: Maybe that's another way of doing it is like if you do leave your organization, we need you to, to hand off to, to other people and have.\n27:59 Speaker B: You know how Gmail asks you to have a backup email address or something like that?\n28:03 Speaker B: Maybe, yes, maybe there's something like that.\n28:05 Speaker B: Like if you don't Have a backup email for if and when you leave or anything, who knows anything happens to you.\n28:12 Speaker B: Then maybe the, you know, we could ask them to include the delegate.\n28:20 Speaker B: You know, they might be the organizational lead and they are the admin, but maybe there's like a delegate that.\n28:27 Speaker C: And maybe we could also look at it like in the back end the admin, the welding project and admin of the platform can see who the people are, can manage all of these emails and accesses.\n28:41 Speaker C: But then for the user in the front end, you don't see any of this.\n28:46 Speaker C: That could also work and we really protect the data so that anyone else, outside outsiders, external agencies, whatever cannot access this data to see who's here.\n28:56 Speaker B: That is.\n28:57 Speaker B: That gets really tricky because once any view like that is available, it's scary already.\n29:04 Speaker B: It's like screenshots and like, you know, like things.\n29:08 Speaker B: What's it called?\n29:08 Speaker B: We got Epstein's emails about Trump.\n29:13 Speaker B: Right.\n29:14 Speaker B: They're coming out now.\n29:15 Speaker B: You know like you.\n29:17 Speaker B: Yeah.\n29:17 Speaker B: So yeah, it's okay.\n29:21 Speaker B: It's.\n29:21 Speaker B: Yeah.\n29:22 Speaker B: So there's a way of encrypting it.\n29:25 Speaker B: So basically Apple does something really interesting, right?\n29:27 Speaker B: So Apple without telling you, every time you use your Apple card on your phone or you know how you can pay with your phone now, it creates a new number and encrypts the transaction so that Apple can't know and so that the companies, every time you use it, think you're a new person.\n29:47 Speaker B: They can't create a profile of your card number.\n29:49 Speaker B: They don't do it because of people ask them.\n29:53 Speaker B: They do it because that's part of one of their core values is like privacy and security and they just built it in and they didn't tell anybody.\n29:58 Speaker B: You know, it's just that.\n30:00 Speaker B: So it's kind of cool.\n30:02 Speaker B: And also when governments come to Apple and say hey, we caught this criminal, can you decrypt their phone?\n30:08 Speaker B: They can sincerely say no because it's literally physically impossible for them to do that.\n30:16 Speaker B: And so they don't get in trouble legally as well.\n30:19 Speaker B: And so there's some legal assurance to encryption that might be helpful in case like let's.\n30:28 Speaker B: We should.\n30:28 Speaker B: It would be interesting to come up with like the risk profiles and maybe even like the worst case scenarios.\n30:33 Speaker B: Right.\n30:34 Speaker B: But protecting the wellbeing project and protecting everybody might require most things to be encrypted and then there might be a way of doing it so that the well being project can decrypt things.\n30:45 Speaker B: But I would recommend maybe even like individually limited views.\n30:51 Speaker B: So I'm not exactly sure I'll have to think about it a little bit more.\n30:54 Speaker B: But really I want to understand the risk profile a little bit bit deeper and who we're dealing with because, you know, if we're dealing with, you know, the, the FBI or the CIA, there's, there's certain encryption methodologies that some people think were developed by them to be able to be decrypted by them.\n31:15 Speaker B: And there's like deep things.\n31:16 Speaker C: Oh, wow.\n31:17 Speaker B: Yeah, it's.\n31:18 Speaker B: Yeah.\n31:18 Speaker B: RSA is a potentially backdoor encryption that's very commonly used actually.\n31:27 Speaker B: So if we think that the.\n31:29 Speaker B: All this should not be recorded right now actually.\n31:31 Speaker B: But anyway, if we do think that the FBI or the CIA is a potential antagonist that might want, then we should be thinking about that.\n31:40 Speaker B: But if it's just like smaller organizations, like people that are curious and would be willing to try to hack just to figure it out instead of like someone that's really dedicated, like a larger organization.\n31:55 Speaker B: I'm not exactly sure.\n31:59 Speaker B: Yeah.\n31:59 Speaker B: What the worst case scenario might be and what you guys are thinking about in terms of the risks.\n32:04 Speaker C: And this could be something like we could have a think tank or focus group with the pilot test users to chat about these scenarios too.\n32:15 Speaker A: Yeah.\n32:15 Speaker B: Aaron did say that sort of like thinking for people like, because not everyone thinks about some of these risks.\n32:24 Speaker B: Right.\n32:25 Speaker B: Like most people put up pictures of their kids on social media.\n32:29 Speaker B: Just.\n32:30 Speaker B: That's crazy.\n32:30 Speaker B: Like that, that's not, that's a bad idea for many reasons.\n32:36 Speaker B: But, but yeah.\n32:37 Speaker B: So like in terms of doing that focus group, it.\n32:41 Speaker B: You'd have to kind of first show what the problem is to be able to have them understand and then be able to get, you know, feedback.\n32:49 Speaker C: Right.\n32:50 Speaker B: It might be interest.\n32:50 Speaker B: More interesting to do a research on failure points in other organizations that might have some similar data.\n32:59 Speaker B: Right.\n33:00 Speaker B: And how it's been exploited.\n33:02 Speaker B: That could be more, maybe more relevant to try to, to do some research on that.\n33:07 Speaker B: Okay, I gotta go eat and feed the baby.\n33:10 Speaker B: But yeah, I guess I'm, I'm already like jumping all in just because that's my, my attitude.\n33:16 Speaker B: But I'm wondering if you have.\n33:20 Speaker B: You've seen this over time.\n33:21 Speaker B: You've seen like the previous development organization.\n33:24 Speaker B: But like what is like a timeline?\n33:27 Speaker B: Is there or is there no budget, etc?\n33:30 Speaker B: Like how.\n33:32 Speaker C: Yeah, I'll try to get that information from Aaron.\n33:34 Speaker C: I don't have, I've been struggling this year because I don't have that visibility.\n33:40 Speaker C: So.\n33:41 Speaker C: But I'll try to get in from him and get back to you.\n33:45 Speaker B: Yeah.\n33:46 Speaker C: I don't know.\n33:46 Speaker C: Did he Share anything he did.\n33:49 Speaker B: There is a budget but the only thing he said was and non profit rates.\n33:56 Speaker C: Oh great.\n33:58 Speaker B: And my, my wife is, you know we've actually this, I'll just be very frank.\n34:04 Speaker B: You know, we've actually seen people burn out at the wellbeing project and have very difficult like working experiences.\n34:11 Speaker B: So as I'm potentially stepping into doing stuff with the well being project, my wife is like, like remember that person xyz.\n34:20 Speaker B: I'd be careful, like make sure there's a budget and all of these things.\n34:24 Speaker B: And you know, I'm also in a position where I love the project, I love the people and I, I do need a budget, I do need a salary.\n34:34 Speaker B: But I'm also willing to put in some thoughts and thinking on you know, a volunteer basis.\n34:41 Speaker B: I am between contracts.\n34:42 Speaker B: So while I'm searching for contracts I do have some time.\n34:46 Speaker B: I would like it to be a paid gig if possible.\n34:49 Speaker B: But I'm also, you know, willing to make things work, you know.\n34:54 Speaker C: Yeah, I think like did you tell.\n34:58 Speaker B: This to Aaron that yeah, no, I asked about the budget.\n35:02 Speaker B: I think he knows that I would like to be remunerated and I do accept and understand that it's like non profit salary but I have no idea what that means for him.\n35:14 Speaker C: Okay.\n35:15 Speaker B: And like how he thinks the project is and like how much effort it's also you know, like if we, we wanted to do a part pilot like how much research should I be doing on like the, the risks strategies and like into other organizations and their potential like failures and drawbacks.\n35:32 Speaker B: Like the project could grow as much as we want it to.\n35:34 Speaker C: Yeah.\n35:35 Speaker B: So I want to know a little bit about like the potential scope of the budget just so I can say okay, so that means that I'll, you know, we just put like these many boundaries and we make the smallest, quickest prototype that has you know, X, Y or Z affordances to see how things work and then evolve from there.\n35:55 Speaker B: But yeah, it would help to know the budget just to be able to know also how big of a you know, first draft like prototype to explore.\n36:08 Speaker B: And we should talk a couple of times.\n36:10 Speaker B: Like I'm gonna take this call and I'm gonna take some time to think about it and come up with, I think should I be talking with you or should I be trying to talk with both you and Aaron at the same time?\n36:25 Speaker C: I'm.\n36:26 Speaker C: I think you can do it with me and if I think something is necessary to review with Aaron, I'll let him know.\n36:33 Speaker C: If you, something comes up and you want to tell him to like go ahead.\n36:37 Speaker C: But I think it will be easier if it's just you and I. Huh.\n36:40 Speaker B: Okay.\n36:41 Speaker C: And I'll ask him about the budget and time frame again, trying to get some clarity.\n36:46 Speaker C: And for you too, I completely understand.\n36:47 Speaker C: Like I'd be in your position and I'd be the same.\n36:50 Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.\n36:51 Speaker B: But the, the cool news, I think I told you is that I no longer am like a co founder of Bloom.\n36:57 Speaker B: I, I stepped back to be on the board, you know, when you went off to the United States and is trying to expand there.\n37:05 Speaker B: I'm trying to figure out what's next.\n37:07 Speaker B: It's like a big bit of a question mark.\n37:09 Speaker B: But yeah, it's been interesting.\n37:14 Speaker B: I've been exploring lots of things and exploring also how to stay in touch with the community and actually instead of just leaving people to do the next program, which is what our funders have always wanted, it's like next program, next program.\n37:27 Speaker B: I looked back and I'm like, we have 10, 11 people that have, we've accompanied, you know, each of them sometimes for like three or four months at a time and then we just leave them.\n37:37 Speaker B: And all of them, you know, I've been, I called 30 so far and they all had such nice things to say and like you're my people, like why should I go find new people?\n37:47 Speaker B: So I'm thinking of ways of creating also non funded but like self funded support organization for this group.\n37:58 Speaker B: This is kind of what's evolving right now.\n38:00 Speaker B: I'm wondering if we can be stronger together.\n38:03 Speaker B: Maybe some kind of like membership thing, maybe even like revenue share, creating a new type of investment vehicle, sort of like an ETF.\n38:12 Speaker B: But for social enterprises, you know, we have 10, 11 enterprises and normal investors look at them and they're like, oh, you're growing like 10%, 20%, 30% a year.\n38:22 Speaker B: Like that's nothing.\n38:23 Speaker B: We need 10x to 1000x.\n38:26 Speaker B: Right.\n38:27 Speaker B: And yeah, just because of what they're.\n38:30 Speaker B: The stack of investors, you know, there's like pension funds and then limited partners and then investors and then social enterprises are in the riskiest basket.\n38:41 Speaker B: So if you.\n38:42 Speaker B: Everybody needs like 3x over the person underneath them for their investments all to make sense.\n38:48 Speaker B: And it just doesn't make sense.\n38:49 Speaker B: And this whole ecosystem is silly.\n38:51 Speaker B: And so I was thinking how do we de risk it and we can just put 100 of them together, you know, and then we'll be able to give dividends and we don't have to give equity.\n39:00 Speaker B: We can say hey, just like invest in this group.\n39:04 Speaker B: Of social enterprises and you get, you know, whatever 3% above inflation and it's, it's, it's safe because we have two years of data on all of them about their revenue.\n39:17 Speaker B: Anyway, so I'm trying to come up with this idea of being stronger together and creating ways of supporting each other.\n39:23 Speaker B: And this is where it gets crazy.\n39:25 Speaker B: I know you guys, you don't want payment processing on the platform, but I'm trying to figure out if I can get people to share revenue, you know.\n39:35 Speaker C: Wow.\n39:36 Speaker B: Yeah.\n39:36 Speaker B: And so far everyone said yes.\n39:38 Speaker B: That's the crazy thing.\n39:39 Speaker B: So the idea is like if you put in, you know, 5% of your revenue, 2 to 5% every month and then if everyone does that and then one month you are under your average for the last six months, we top you up back to your average.\n39:56 Speaker B: And if you're over, then you're paying more into the system because a lot of organizations have very choppy incomes.\n40:03 Speaker B: And if we're pulling revenues like this, first of all we accrue like an investment pool so that we can actually invest in each other and we can make co investment decisions.\n40:13 Speaker B: But also we can top people up when, let's say some unexpected things happen or like schools for instance.\n40:22 Speaker B: A lot of my teams are in education.\n40:25 Speaker B: During the school year it's great.\n40:26 Speaker B: But then in the summer everybody.\n40:28 Speaker B: And then hire people again, which is not good for their, not good for an organization.\n40:33 Speaker B: So this way they can actually basically chip in during the school year and then take back during the, the months off summer.\n40:43 Speaker B: Yeah.\n40:43 Speaker B: So this is kind of what I'm exploring with the teams.\n40:45 Speaker B: It's evolving.\n40:47 Speaker B: It's kind of crazy.\n40:48 Speaker B: It's a little scary, but just.\n40:52 Speaker B: Yeah, because dealing with money, you know, like money and relationships can be so, yeah.\n40:57 Speaker B: Dangerous.\n40:58 Speaker B: But from 10 11, if I can find 100 people with the right attitude and the right like financial structure, then that would be great.\n41:08 Speaker B: Would be so cool to do something like this.\n41:10 Speaker B: Anyway, we'll see.\n41:11 Speaker C: Wow.\n41:12 Speaker C: Bilal, no.\n41:13 Speaker C: Thank you for sharing.\n41:14 Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n41:15 Speaker B: Well, we'll see how it goes.\n41:17 Speaker B: So far I, I got like real great feedback.\n41:20 Speaker B: And you know, the other crazy thing is you'd love to hear this.\n41:22 Speaker B: As somebody from the well being project, I'm just so surprised that people like when I ask them about the programming and like what we did, that was really helpful.\n41:32 Speaker B: People are asking for well being experiences, reminders, practices, and mentioning it as like the core reason why they joined our programs to begin with.\n41:44 Speaker B: They're like, because of that like messaging and marketing and we desperately need this in our.\n41:49 Speaker B: And I'm like, you know, like, sometimes you think of it as a fluffy thing, even though we've been talking and working about it for so long.\n41:57 Speaker B: Then when this happens, you're like, oh, no, it's real.\n42:00 Speaker B: It matters.\n42:01 Speaker C: Real.\n42:02 Speaker A: Yeah.\n42:03 Speaker C: All right.\n42:04 Speaker C: Thank you.\n42:04 Speaker C: I got chills.\n42:07 Speaker B: Yeah, we'll see.\n42:08 Speaker B: We'll see how this goes.\n42:10 Speaker B: And it's.\n42:10 Speaker B: It's nice to have some more touch points.\n42:14 Speaker B: So, inshallah, hopefully you won't get sick of hearing from me, but I'll do a little bit of work on this and I'll.\n42:21 Speaker B: You know, this is one thing I need to learn because I'm.\n42:25 Speaker B: I've never been a consultant.\n42:27 Speaker B: I've always just been a project person and I just invest my whole self.\n42:30 Speaker C: Right.\n42:30 Speaker B: I'm just like, dive in.\n42:32 Speaker B: And so this idea of I will give myself 10 hours and then I'll stop and whatever I am at, I will share and.\n42:41 Speaker B: And then we'll see if there's like, budget for more than that.\n42:43 Speaker B: Like, that kind of attitude and mindset is so not me.\n42:48 Speaker B: But we'll see.\n42:48 Speaker B: I'll.\n42:49 Speaker B: I think I'll have to practice something like that because I can.\n42:52 Speaker B: I can just get into rabbit holes, you know, and.\n42:55 Speaker C: Yeah, but like, in the long run, if you're seeing that those boundaries help for your, like, for your well being, basically.\n43:04 Speaker B: No, Yeah, I need, I need to figure it out.\n43:07 Speaker C: It's.\n43:08 Speaker B: I did, I did get a few contracts, so I just finished my contract with the U.N. but then there's.\n43:14 Speaker B: I don't know if you've ever been in this place, but, you know, I'm just applying for contracts, you know, and that takes work, that's effort that no one pays you for.\n43:22 Speaker B: And a lot of time.\n43:24 Speaker B: Yeah.\n43:25 Speaker B: And then you get some of them.\n43:26 Speaker B: And so.\n43:27 Speaker B: So it's really hard to figure out, like, how much time I have for.\n43:33 Speaker B: For even side projects like this.\n43:34 Speaker B: Right.\n43:34 Speaker B: Like this.\n43:35 Speaker B: This is, this is great.\n43:36 Speaker B: But even if it would be great, I think there is a budget.\n43:40 Speaker B: But, like, I could spend 100% of my time just applying to things.\n43:44 Speaker B: Right.\n43:45 Speaker B: And then I'll have to figure out my hit rates and all of these things.\n43:49 Speaker B: I think I don't belong in consulting.\n43:50 Speaker B: I'm gonna hopefully take it easy and slowly grow this pool of entrepreneurs that I've been talking with within Bloom.\n43:59 Speaker B: I might have to come up with a new name, but I think it's going to be.\n44:02 Speaker B: That might be my next thing.\n44:04 Speaker B: It will be this, like, community support.\n44:06 Speaker B: And I'm thinking about Doing it in a tiered way.\n44:08 Speaker B: So initially, wellbeing, practices, conversations, networking.\n44:13 Speaker B: You pay, I don't know, 50 bucks a month or something like that.\n44:16 Speaker B: You get access to this and I get to have an income.\n44:20 Speaker B: And then once we build trust and keep talking about this idea of like our financial strength and bringing that together, I can start talking about like this new investment type and form the cooperative.\n44:34 Speaker B: Basically it would be a cooperative social enterprises that can take outside investment, but also invest in its itself.\n44:41 Speaker B: But yeah, that's the idea is to stage it.\n44:42 Speaker B: And I think that's going to be my next thing.\n44:44 Speaker B: But I'm not.\n44:44 Speaker B: I'm not sure yet.\n44:49 Speaker B: Hopefully you're a little tired.\n44:51 Speaker B: I wish I could give you some chocolate.\n44:54 Speaker C: I delicious with that orange red.\n44:56 Speaker B: Oh, I love that one.\n44:57 Speaker B: Yeah.\n44:58 Speaker C: Yes, me too.\n44:59 Speaker B: Okay, I'll get you some.\n45:02 Speaker B: We'll see when we see each other next.\n45:03 Speaker B: It'll probably be sometime from now, but inshallah, we will soon at some point.\n45:08 Speaker C: Yes, yes.\n45:10 Speaker C: Thank you so much.\n45:12 Speaker B: You're in Mexico?\n45:14 Speaker C: Mexico City.\n45:15 Speaker C: Yes.\n45:16 Speaker A: Okay.\n45:16 Speaker B: I just met some visitors from Mexico City on the train from Paris.\n45:21 Speaker B: And they were a family.\n45:23 Speaker B: They were so cute.\n45:24 Speaker B: A lady and her mom and her brother, and they were going on a tour of Europe and they were just going as a.\n45:31 Speaker B: As like as a family.\n45:33 Speaker B: And it was just so nice.\n45:36 Speaker B: I. I loved, you know, sharing the fact that I visited Mexico and Mexico City and they were so.\n45:43 Speaker B: They spoke so little French and so little English.\n45:47 Speaker B: And I'm like, how are you going to do this?\n45:48 Speaker B: But they were cute.\n45:50 Speaker B: Family made me think of you and our times together.\n45:53 Speaker B: Hopefully.\n45:54 Speaker B: Hopefully see each other soon.\n45:56 Speaker C: Yes.\n45:57 Speaker C: Thank you, Bilal.\n45:58 Speaker C: I hope you have a good Friday and weekend with your family.\n46:07 Speaker C: Thank you.",

      "content": "Love that you dropped the whole call in here — super helpful.\n\nHere’s a tight, Bilal-sounding snapshot you can send back to Aaron / Ale or just use as your own compass.\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 My intentions (for this springboard / “registry” thing)\n\n- I don’t want to build another **social network** or “platform guilt” machine.  \n- I want a **simple springboard**: you come in, get what you need (a coach, a tool, a piece of research), and go back to real life.  \n- I want Aaron *out* of the role of **human switchboard** for “who do you know?” questions.  \n- I want to **test with a small garden** of orgs (10–30), learn what’s actually useful, then decide if it should grow.  \n- I want something that feels **modern and easy**, so the pilot tests the value of the idea, not people’s tolerance for clunky UX.  \n- I want to explore this in a way that **respects my own time and livelihood** (clear scope, non-exploitative “non-profit rates”).  \n\n---\n\n## 💎 Values this must protect\n\n- **Safety of front-line people** – no easy map for hostile states to see who’s burned out or who’s leading what.  \n- **Organisational shielding** – orgs log in; individual humans aren’t exposed as a browsable list.  \n- **No surveillance feeling** – people shouldn’t worry that their wellbeing scores are being watched or weaponised.  \n- **Not a marketplace** – no in-app chat, no payment flows, no negotiation space; we’re not recreating Upwork.  \n- **Simplicity over feature-creep** – better a small, clear springboard than an “iPhone of wellbeing” that tries to do everything.  \n- **Thinking about risk on behalf of users** – many folks won’t see the threats; we design as if serious actors *might* be watching.  \n\n---\n\n## 🌱 Core concepts we can try (and stress-test)\n\n- **Springboard, not platform** – one-time (or occasional) access: climb up, bounce, come back when you really need it again.  \n- **Org accounts + service-provider profiles**  \n  - Orgs log in and recommend coaches/therapists.  \n  - Recommended people can optionally “claim” a provider profile, but users don’t become a social graph.  \n- **Three main “reservoirs”**  \n  1. Trusted **coaches/therapists** and support services.  \n  2. **Research repository** (papers, reports, PDFs) with good tagging.  \n  3. A **shared survey tool** (Richie’s / WBP’s validated survey) that orgs can deploy and compare to a field baseline.  \n- **Big yearly + small seasonal**  \n  - A **yearly “big” org survey** for membership / baseline.  \n  - Optional **quarterly micro-updates** for offerings (e.g. open programs for changemakers’ wellbeing).  \n- **Clear NO list to shape the thing**  \n  - No social feed, no open DMs, no payments, no “who’s in this org?” browsing between orgs.  \n- **AI in the right place**  \n  - Not for generic chat or hype, but as:  \n    - A **RAG assistant** over the research library (“show me where X is discussed and link me there”).  \n    - Maybe later: light help extracting profile fields from reflective writing *with explicit consent*.  \n\nIf you want, I can now turn this into a 60-second “here’s what I’m holding” script you can literally read at the top of your next call.",
