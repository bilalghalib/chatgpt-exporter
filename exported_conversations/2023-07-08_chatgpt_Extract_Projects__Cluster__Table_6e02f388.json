Collaborate.\nMore stakeholders, more ideas / answers. \nBilal: Schools are interesting spaces to influence ideas\nLots of ambiguity about what it is we are really doing. What do we really take back?\nLaughter/hug doesn’t count. \nWellbeing at the core of higher education institutions\nAnd wellbeing is a very “heavy subject” - We want the orgs to be lean\nSafe space. \nT 3 groups:\nFocused on central mission / who are we? \nThis network is by higher education network and for higher education \nBy them and for htem. Includes all higher education ecosystem to create global connections that help us embody wellbeing and foster welldoing. \nOther groups discussed seeds who we are.\nRecalling the history of universities as places of “Formation” not a \nWellbeing fits in both places. Beyond in higher education. \nCentral mission to facilitate collaborations?\nBringing a wellbeing curriculum into all different departments. \nHow do cope with stressors at school - bringing the\n\nH2 Horizon two\nSet up an exchange program to learn first hand how peoples organizations work and bring wellbeing work or don’t work. \nStudent immersion - exchanging students. Exchanging context of a person it’s a lot wider of a perspective. \nYallah beirut. \nMore people from our organizations involved from this. I got permission from vice president, they know that I’m here. I wish I could take something fromhere to convince top level management that this matters. Deepti - says Same! I’m the only indian person here. Why not make a smaller hub in India itself. Regional meetups. We’re smaller. \nMany big organizations are focused on Wellbeing. \nHow do you work on \nWellbeing practices you’re doing this year. Make it real for us first.\nMaybe we have accountability buddies? \nSuperna models these kinds of things. That kind of modeling helps us see that wellbeing practices can be done. \nGetting more personal - accountability and followup meetings. \nPersonal/communal wellbeing can be practiced together. \nTo work on systemic/structural action - we share policies for wellbeing / code of conduct. Organizational change / processes and procedures. \n\nRound 2:\nSleepy - no cognitive dissonance \nValues and exploration of values. \nAccountability buddies \nFocus on my own wellbeing first is challenging\nFocus is always impact oriented first not inclined to focus myself \nMapping of people resources knowledge in the room \nAccess them as people, not as a DB/ to upload papers \nTrauma informed curriculum for youth - how can I search  DB with certain keywords to find the right people who can help me do that. \nComing up with new tech platforms isn’t always so useful. It’s all about relationships. Tech platform that helps connect humans. Knowledge exchange. \nHuman conversation helps accelerate knowledge transfer. \nOsare: \nNext year get down to the basics as a network. If you asked everyone what’s the point. We will all give you a general idea but not give you a specific idea.\nClear articulation of what’s going on, why, where, what are we solving for. (maybe how later)\nBased on direction - co-woning and codirection. Not ready for that yet. Some form of leadership. Someone who has authority of direction. Someone who says ‘this is the point, this is direction” - based on that we make a year plan.\nWhen a person comes in after that establishment - people can start working because there is a structure. \nGeneral need: curriculum. Design session. \nCodesigning curriculum then coming back and contextualizing.\nKnowledge sharing: It’s now the job of each member to contextualize. This is what we designed/contextualized and share.\nEveryone is beautiful and nice and food is good…. What’s happening? \nQ. Do we need specific goals for the network? Do we need to set specific goals for the network? \nConcern is to add work on top of our work. Set a different work plan w/different goals / priorities would people do it?\nO: Goal number 1, who is leadership/authority of direction. Articulate that and disseminate. \nWe were working in groups but largely unproductive because we were not directed.\nWork we’re doing already based on a direction that’s already been set. \nIntentionally setting results and deliverables then it could work\n\n\nBahare: \nI’m so sleepy.\nI didn’t get to talk to everyone here and there are more people who are not here. \nMake the community and give us more instruction and framework to do our own parts in it. \nElisa:\nDB to filter and search who might be interesting to talk to a mandatory spotlight on who they are and a challenge they are facing. \nSee the projects people are working on. \nBilal\nIf you liked someone call them. \nDoughnut put availability and schedule chats with people\n\nOnboarding - easier when there is clarity. \nFoster engagement, subcircles, regional events. \nBanking of talents. \nEstefania - nature growth? Facilitation guide for wellbeing ambassadors. \n\nIdentify existing wellbeing definitions for higher education institutions. \nResonate w/xy or z\nWorking groups, call to clarify purpose. Overarching purpose. Set expectations and milestones. \n\nMapping what we have - not constructing new things. Pep already has working group. \n\nLeave here with something we are interested in developing with other members. \n\nWhat’s working / not working . \nChoosing the right technology. \nNotion could be applied for everyone. \nSpotlight moments. \nWorking group presentations.\n\n\n\nAction Steps:\nWrite here..\n\nSecond set of notes:\nCircle:\t\t3A\nTime:\t\t00:00 AM\nTopic: \t\tHorizon 2 – What will we do in the year ahead \nLeader:\tName\nNote taker:\tKaisu\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nNotes:\nTopics, structures topics that help us to move from Horizon 1 to Horizon 2. Generating specific ideas. \nA little bit more structure and guidance would help a lot. Towards where are we heading? \nIf we have ideas to share ideas to implement in wellbeing curriculum, which is the platform to enable collaboration. Open, visible, easy to use. \nAn element of leadership is needed to be strengthened. \nIt is useful to have the conversation of what people want to turnh that to clear actions. \nWhat is the prelog of the network? Would be nice to know the narrative from the past to build the narrative of the future. \nFor instance in this gathering everything that has been done has been enjoyable but sometimes missing which are the bigger purposes of things. \nWe need to get down to the basics; articulating the point of the network, to be able to figure out what are our goals. We could have a better onboarding plan. \nIf you ask people what this network is about they may be related but there are many definitions. \nDisciplinary or interdisciplinary outcomes of what we want to have \nIdeas from others and see how to apply in ones own different context\nOnce having clear goals we can also measure wins and losses and share them, learn from them. \nKnowing the end goal is critical to know how to build the path. \nFor new members or the ones that did not necessary drive their participation in the network its not being clear on how to see or build a clear direction. Need of understanding which is the framework/playground. \nHow could we reach into a stonger leadership model to show direction. \nHow could we come up with a blueprint for our process. \nTo have a resource of what people have been doing and showcase – receive feedback, other ideas. \nAbility to connect more and more on an individual level outside of the encounterings and forums. Projects or working groups but also ways to connect in an individual level. \nIt may be also a reflection of the network that the \nPast – small amout of institutions coming together, putting their blueprints together, editorial work of what this network may mean. Suddenly a huge growth in the network – somehow seeing what each one does and who we really are. The workgroups were built – documentation, barriors to wellbeing (commonalities and barriers), curriculum group broke up into multiple subgroups – building curriculum wide spectrum; specific to wellbeing, community; divided in to students faculty and different schools trying to find funding together. After all that we took the first day to see what was good on looking into the working groups, stage two where are we now and where do we want to head, and now trying to see what can be needed in concrete to take the next steps. \nBest practises and/or renaissance in higher ed with wellbeing at the core; how could we help each other to get that by convincing policy makers, presidents and funding…\n90 members, different levels of participation; we have 2 years to get ourselves on the track, that is the time that Wellbeing is sustaining much of the coordination. \nHow can this serve everyone in a way that is important. \n\n\n\n\nAction Steps:\nBuilding a clear vision and goals → robust plan of involvement\nSharing best practises and seeing the best way to do so – Monthly conversations and themes to work on, or dividing based on projects. This requires more organizational ledership\nGoals that unite, even if there can be different priorities. \nOnboarding plan – clarity in what is going on and how can you be part and take advantage of it\nFocus and dynamics\nCommonalities and working areas to work on\nDirectory of people their interests and their willing to be contacted for…. \nThird set of notes:\nCircle:\t\t8A\nTime:\t\t00:00 AM\nTopic: \t\tHorizon 2 - What will we do in the year ahead? \nLeader:\tName\nNote taker:\tName\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nNote:\n\nCan the definition of well-being be shared among institutions or does it depend a lot on institutions’ context?\n\n\nAction steps:\n\nWrite here..\n\nMapping projects\nThemes\nMethodologies\nTarget / Stakeholder definition\nImproving communication\nChoose the right technological tools\n                                                               i.

These themes include developing a well-being curriculum, strengthening leadership and direction, improving communication and connection, implementing technology tools, creating support materials and data for convincing leadership, and fostering a culture of knowledge sharing.\n\nHere is the consolidated table of future projects as extracted from the notes:\n\n| Project/ Initiative | Similar Mentioned in Tables | Description |\n|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------|\n| Well-being Curriculum | 1A, 3A, 8A | Developing a curriculum that emphasizes well-being. Involves sharing ideas on well-being practices and exploring the feasibility of embedding this into all departments of educational institutions. |\n| Clear Vision and Direction | 1A, 3A | Articulating the purpose and direction of the network, including setting clear goals and deliverables.
