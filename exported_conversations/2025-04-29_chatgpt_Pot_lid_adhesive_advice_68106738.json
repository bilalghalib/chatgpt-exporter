      "content": "Thanks for the photo — I can help you interpret it.\n\nThe product you have is made by Henkel (a German company) and appears to be a **type of adhesive** (likely a repair glue).  \nHowever, based on the **hazard symbols** (especially the exclamation mark and the environmental hazard) and the **lack of high heat resistance labeling**, **this is probably not heat-safe** for something like a pot lid.\n\n**A few points based on your image:**\n- It's likely a **standard household adhesive** for minor repairs.\n- No indication that it is **food-safe** or **resistant to high temperatures** like 100°C+ (which a pot lid would easily reach).\n- Products that are safe for kitchenware usually specifically say \"**résiste à la chaleur**\" (heat-resistant) and \"**contact alimentaire**\" (food-safe).\n\n### **Conclusion:**  \n**Do not use this glue to repair a pot lid**, especially if it will be exposed to heat or food.  \nIt could melt, release toxic fumes, or contaminate your food.\n\n---\n\n**If you want**, I can help you find a better option! Would you like me to recommend a proper heat-resistant, food-safe adhesive for your pot lid repair?",

      "content": "Good question — let's get specific:\n\n**In general, silicone glues/sealants** can be very **good** for repairs involving **heat** and **kitchen use**, **but** **only certain types** are safe for this.\n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n\n| Type | Heat Resistance | Food-Safe? | Comments |\n|:-----|:----------------|:-----------|:---------|\n| **Standard silicone sealant** (like bathroom/kitchen silicone) | Up to ~150–200°C | **Not usually food-safe** | Good for sealing but not touching food |\n| **High-temperature (RTV) silicone** | Up to ~300–350°C | Sometimes food-safe (check label) | Often labeled as \"high-temp\" or \"gasket maker\" |\n| **Food-grade silicone adhesive** | Moderate heat (~200°C) | **Yes, food-safe** | Used for making molds, kitchenware repairs |\n\n---\n\n### **So, general rules:**\n- **Ordinary silicone glue** (like for bathrooms) = heat resistant but **not safe for food-contact surfaces**.\n- **High-temperature RTV silicone** = excellent heat resistance (used even in cars!), **but check if food-safe**.\n- **Food-grade silicone glue** = the safest if the repaired part will touch food, or even steam.\n\n### **For a pot lid repair:**\n- If the glue will be **inside the pot or near steam/food**, you need **food-grade** and **heat-resistant** silicone.\n- If it’s **just on the outer rim**, you can use **high-temp RTV silicone** (even automotive gasket silicone can sometimes be fine for the outside, but not in food areas).\n\n---\n\n### **Example product types you could use:**\n- **Permatex High-Temp Red RTV Silicone** (for heat, not food-safe).\n- **Silicone glues marketed for aquarium use** (some are food-safe because they're non-toxic once cured).\n- **Food-safe silicone adhesive** (harder to find, but ideal).\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to suggest an exact product depending on where you live? (For example: France, USA, etc.) It will help me find a proper, safe recommendation for you!  \nWant me to?",
