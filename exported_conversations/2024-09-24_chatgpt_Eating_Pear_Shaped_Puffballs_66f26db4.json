      "content": "Pear-shaped puffballs (Lycoperdon pyriforme) are generally considered edible when young, before the spores develop inside. While you don't need to peel them, it's important to make sure they are fresh and that the interior is pure white. As puffballs age, they turn yellow or brown inside, indicating that they are no longer edible.\n\nBefore eating, you should cut them open to check that they are still in their edible stage. If the interior is any color other than white, it is best to discard them. Also, it's crucial to ensure they are correctly identified, as some inedible or toxic mushrooms can resemble puffballs.",
