      "content": "I’m working on an answer to this question in this email, but I don’t like what I wrote. I feel like it’s Long and Ramy. Can you help me clarify what I’m trying to say Ok -my preference is not to work hourly. I find that hourly work encourages a lack of efficiency and of a view of being itself being equivalent and connected to money so I prefer projects and I prefer value and I can do this project. I mean, if you didn’t find any insightful quotes inside of the sheets, then I can’t, but I think that I found some interesting quotes from the sheet. So if you want to look into the sheet, especially maybe around the story of people calling each other, the N-word and other experiences of black students. I think you’ll find that it does identify them well and I don’t know it’s actually I made a system that will make it quite easy to export them and so I can give it a shot on maybe 10 different interviews maybe I’ll do three or four interviews maybe a couple of them for a year and if you’re particularly interested in on the black student experience, I think I can do a pre-filter and make sure the transcript includes content about that topic. And then rather than giving you all of this material, which must be overwhelming I will give you a little report with for quotes each and then you can pay me what you want. I’ve enjoyed working on the software and I think it’ll provide value for me in this project and for others in other\n\nOn Thu, Oct 30, 2025 at 07:48 Noor Doukmak <doukmaknoor@gmail.com> wrote:\nI will say in terms of identifying 2-3 powerful quotes from each of the four districts, if that is something you can generate in a document- it would be best to hone in on quotes related to the negative experiences of Black students in school.  \n\nIf you don’t have the capacity to do this, please no worries.

Please let me know what you think.\n\nIn terms of generating quotes- This process will take me some time to go through, and unfortunately that is the main asset I am missing: time!

That is a setting you can change in the software. \n\nIf you want to use it you can go here: http://transcript-explorer-two.vercel.app/ and make a username/pass, give your project a title and follow the steps I showed you in the video above. I've filled it up with about 50 videos worth of funding, so feel free to experiment with it. \n\nOh, if you found this website that allows you to ask questions to transcripts and get structured knowledge out of it and verbatim quotes, would you pay for it? How much per video analysis? Maybe better than a subscription in this case. - I'm trying to figure out if I should put this online somewhere behind a paywall.\n\nHope you're doing well, salam :)\n\nBG\n\nOn Tue, Oct 28, 2025 at 5:43 AM Noor Doukmak <doukmaknoor@gmail.com> wrote:\nSalam Bilal,\nAny updates on a quote? \n\nOn Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at 7:17 AM Noor Doukmak <doukmaknoor@gmail.com> wrote:\nSalam Bilal,\nWe are not at that level, unfortunately.

It's totally possible before Wednesday, it also does follow up on some of my work which needs provenance and confidence when working with LLMs which can be tricky. My method involves using more tokens than normal to derive the following structure for each extract:\nVerbatim quote with timestamps, Knowledge/Idea/Summary, relevant question(from your list), confidence in its reasoning,  Reasoning(why LLM thinks this quote matches the question) - this way you can get all the high confidence easy/clear quotations, and then review the lower confidence ones. You can also review the timestamp to ensure its accuracy.\n\nMy question is if this is a one off or if it's a process you might need to do regularly. If it's a process I could build something more stable, if it's a one off, perhaps Nilam and I can take it on as hourly (although at some point depending on how many schools/videos you're looking for) it might still be better to build an extractor/scraper. \n\nHope you're having a beautiful day :)\nSalam, \nBG\n\nOn Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at 1:26 AM Noor Doukmak <doukmaknoor@gmail.com> wrote:\nAlso: will be important to ensure each quote is cited accurately in the final product. \n\nFinally, I just checked with my teammate and he said it’s fine for the videos to come from other channels - we just need the citation.\n\nThank you again,\nNoor\n\nOn Wed, Oct 22, 2025 at 3:41 PM Noor Doukmak <doukmaknoor@gmail.com> wrote:\nAs salamu alaykum Nilam and Bilal,\n\nThank you for your email and for considering my request.\n\nYes, that’s right!

From what we understand, the project seems to involve two main parts:\n\nCollecting and preparing the data: identifying the YouTube channels of school boards across the four cities, retrieving and cleaning transcripts from 2021–2024, and organizing them into a searchable format.\nAnalyzing and extracting quotes: reviewing those transcripts to pull key excerpts around the themes you mentioned, such as equity, community, representation, and parent involvement.\nBecause the first part involves discovery and setup work, rather than starting from a predefined list of videos, we think it doesn’t quite fit a standard hourly structure. We’re currently considering the fairest and most practical way to approach this\n\nWe also wanted to clarify one thing: should the videos only come from the official YouTube accounts of the school boards, or would it also be acceptable to include videos posted by other channels as long as they’re clearly from public school board meetings in those cities?\n\nAnd just to help us plan better, do you already have a specific deadline or timeframe in mind for this work?\n\nThank you in advance :)\n\nWarm regards,\nNilam \n\n\nOn Tue, Oct 21, 2025 at 11:30 PM Noor Doukmak <doukmaknoor@gmail.com> wrote:\nSalam Bilal and Nilam!\nI hope you are both doing well.\nI know it's been a while since we connected.

You prefer project/value-based work over hourly.  \n2. You can deliver what Noor needs (a set of quotes, filtered and digestible).  \n3. You want to propose a simple, fair way forward.  \n\nHere’s a tightened version you could send:  \n\n---\n\n**Draft reply:**  \n\nSalam Noor,  \n\nThanks for clarifying. My preference is not to work hourly, since I find it encourages inefficiency and reduces the work to time spent rather than value delivered. I prefer project-based arrangements, and I believe I can deliver on this request.  \n\nFrom what I’ve seen in the transcripts, there are meaningful quotes—especially around the experiences of Black students (for example, stories of slurs being used or parents describing inequities). I can pre-filter the material so that you’re only reviewing quotes directly tied to the Black student experience.  \n\nRather than sending you a flood of transcripts, I suggest preparing a short report with a handful of strong quotes from each district (e.g. 2–4 each). That way you have a clear, usable document without being overwhelmed.  \n\nFor compensation, since this is experimental, I’m happy to work on a simple “pay what feels fair” basis for this first round (say, 10 interviews). If it proves useful, we can agree on a clearer structure going forward.  \n\nLet me know if this approach works for you.  \n\nWarmly,  \nBilal  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to make it **more formal/professional** (framing this as a consultancy deliverable), or **lighter and friendlier** (keeping the “experiment / try it out” vibe)?",

      "content": "Yeah, maybe we can say something like, since I've already made the tool, this additional extract will only cost a dollar for a document. For me, I don't need to say exactly how much it'll cost. Maybe I just tell it, like, I was feeling like $2.50 for the whole thing, so five hours. It's probably how much I spent on it. Yeah, so, yeah, that's kind of what I was feeling. It was like a $2.50 would be good. I don't even know if I should have shown her the software anymore. I was thinking, I make the software, and I give it to her, and she can do the work, but she doesn't want to, so maybe I'll just make the report. A little annoyed, obviously, I guess, but yeah, not sure what to do exactly here. What do you think is the ideal scenario? And help me write a good document for that. I mean, basically, she wanted me to extract some quotes about these things, and I made a website that does it pretty well, I think, and bonjour. Bonjour. And I'm not really sure what I want out of this. I feel like I made this website, put in this effort, and I'm being either glanced at or underappreciated. Is this normal? I guess it is. I wouldn't have read it. I put a lot of thought into building this thing. Well, I think you did a good job. Do you think there's a market for it? Maybe I should just switch this conversation around after we get the email out, and just think with you about who might want to pay to be able to put in a list of YouTube videos, or upload a series of files, and then to get a list of things. They don't have to be questions, but they're just prompts, right? Someone wants to find any time someone used a question, or you can ask for any time someone curses, or you can ask for anything. She was using it to ask for community experiences of African students, and it pulls out with diarization. And if people say their names, or it can get it from the context, it gets their names and the roles. It's kind of cool, because then it says like, this person who is this at this school said that. And so I feel like there's some value in a lot of public information that isn't being appropriately categorized, compiled, and made useful. Maybe it's for investors who are looking for places where the housing market has some new regulations, or they want to search for City Hall documents, where they are interested in investing in wastewater treatments. I don't know, actually. What are interesting things that get shared, especially shared on YouTube? I think a lot of places do that. Or just in terms of having audio files. And how can we benefit from the software that we made? Or is it completely useless now that there is large language models? I mean, technically, someone could download the audio, maybe even use an LLM to transcribe it, and then ask the LLM to find all the quotes, and then ask the LLM to organize it. But is software that leverages large language models to do these things in sequence valuable? It's a process, right? And it's also the prompts, although people can get the prompts. So what is the businesses of the future if this is all going to become just like, you talk to it and it does stuff, right? Can you think deeply with me about this and see how we can figure out, first, what to say to this email, and then second, what to do about the thing that we built? And if I should just forget it, or if I should put it on Hacker News or Reddit, is it a useful thing? And let's think down the line by connecting the dots and strategically. What's actually happening? What do people use these tools for? How will they get better? And then if they do get better, what's the point of building software? Still, is there? And who might be the current buyers for what I have? And maybe they're like, whoop, price points, and what they would pay, and all that jazz. And where we can find them, how we can charge them, how we can charge them in a way that makes sense for my token fees and all that.",

Two tracks:\n\n1) land this email cleanly (project/value, not hourly),  \n2) position your tool so people *pay for the workflow + auditability*, not “just prompts.”\n\nHere’s a crisp reply you can send, then a plan for the product.\n\n---\n\n# Draft reply to Noor\n\nSubject: Quotes deliverable + simple fixed fee\n\nSalam Noor,\n\nThanks for the clarity. I’d prefer a simple project fee rather than hourly—value over time spent.\n\n**What I’ll deliver**\n- A short doc with **2–3 powerful quotes per district** (8–12 total) focused on negative experiences of Black students.\n- Each quote will include **verbatim text, timestamp, speaker (name/role when available), source link**, and one line of context.\n\n**Why I’m confident**\nI’ve already built a workflow that filters transcripts for exactly these themes (with diarization, names/roles when inferable). The **marginal cost on my side is about \\$1 per video**, so this is efficient to run at scale.\n\n**Fee (fixed)**\nLet’s do a **\\$250 flat** for this first pass. If it’s useful, we can extend (e.g., another round per district, or a larger sweep) using the same structure.\n\nIf that works, I’ll proceed and send you the doc in this format.\n\nWarmly,  \nBilal\n\n---\n\n# What’s the “ideal scenario” here?\n\n- **Do the report now** (prove value with a tidy, decision-ready document).\n- **Then offer two paths**:\n  1) Ongoing sourcing + extraction as a service (you run it).  \n  2) Access to the tool (they run it) for organizations with analyst capacity.\n\nYou avoid the “teach me your tool for free” loop; you’re selling *outcomes* with verifiable citations.\n\n---\n\n# Is your tool worth pushing? Yes—sell the workflow & provenance\n\nLLMs make “find me quotes” sound trivial. What isn’t trivial (and what orgs need to trust) is:\n\n- **Provenance:** timestamped, linkable source + who said it.\n- **Repeatability:** same inputs → same structured outputs.\n- **Filtering at scale:** pre-filters by topic/actor; batch over 100s of files.\n- **Light analysis:** auto-tagging to a taxonomy; per-quote confidence.\n- **Human-ready outputs:** reports people can paste into decks, with citations.\n\nThat’s a legit moat: **workflow + auditability + scale.**\n\n---\n\n# Likely buyers (today)\n\n- **Journalism & research:** investigative reporters; policy researchers; NICAR/IRE community.  \n- **Civic/Gov/Advocacy:** city councils, school boards, watchdog NGOs, FOIA labs, civic tech.  \n- **Policy/compliance:** ESG teams scanning public comments, hearings, and shareholder meetings.  \n- **UX & CX research:** summarize customer calls/interviews with attributed quotes.  \n- **Legal/e-discovery (lightweight):** early case assessment on public hearings/meetings.  \n- **Education orgs:** districts, PTAs, foundations doing landscape scans.\n\n---\n\n# How to package/prices (starter numbers you can tweak)\n\n**Self-serve credits (for individuals/SMBs)**\n- \\$19 starter (50 docs), \\$49 pro (200 docs), \\$149 team (1,000 docs).  \n- “1 doc” = 1 uploaded file or 1 video URL → transcript → structured quotes.  \n- Overages: \\$0.10–\\$0.25/doc; your token cost is ~\\$1/video now, so aim to *lower infra* (YT transcripts when available, batch caching) or price per **processed hour** instead:\n  - \\$3–\\$6 per audio/video hour processed (matches value & your costs better than per-file).\n\n**Managed service (outcomes, not tool)**\n- **Pilot report**: \\$250–\\$750 for a focused brief (like Noor’s).  \n- **Monthly scan**: \\$1.5k–\\$5k/mo for monitored sources + weekly digests with attributed quotes.  \n- **One-off landscape**: \\$3k–\\$10k for 100–500 sources, taxonomy, and a final deck.\n\n---\n\n# Positioning (copy you can reuse)\n\n- “**Structured, citable quotes at scale.**”  \n- “Every insight comes with a **timestamp and link**, so your team can trust and reuse it.”  \n- “Turn hours of public hearings into **ready-to-paste quotes with context**.”  \n- “Batch process YouTube, Zoom, and audio files; **filter by topic, role, and district**.”\n\n---\n\n# Go-to-market (low friction)\n\n- **Proof packs**: 3 public boards × last 3 months → publish a sample brief (blur faces/names if needed), show value.  \n- **Communities**: Post a demo + sample report to **Hacker News (Show HN), r/datasets, r/OSINT, NICAR Slack/list, civic tech Discords**.  \n- **Landing page**: one screen, two CTAs: “Upload & try 5 files free” and “Request a managed brief.”  \n- **Integrations**: YouTube channel import; Google Drive/Dropbox; Zoom/Teams recording upload.  \n- **Trust**: a visible “**Every quote is clickable to its source**” badge.\n\n---\n\n# Product guardrails (what makes it sticky)\n\n- **Citations-first UI** (quote → jump to exact second).  \n- **Speaker attribution** (pull from captions + heuristics; show confidence).  \n- **Taxonomy templates** (e.g., Equity > Discipline > Slurs; UX > Onboarding > Friction).  \n- **Saved filters & alerts** (notify when new quotes match a watchlist).  \n- **Export packs** (Google Doc report, CSV, and slide-ready snippets).  \n- **Quality dial** (permissive vs. strict extraction; eval page to compare).\n\n---\n\n# If you want a one-pager to send prospects\n\nI can draft a one-page “Capabilities + Pricing” sheet and a sample 2-page brief outline you can reuse. For now, ship the email above, collect the win, then follow with a short note: “If this format is helpful, here are options for an ongoing monthly scan or access to the tool.”\n\nIf you want, I’ll also punch up landing copy and a Show HN post you can paste.",

Um, filtering at scale. I don't understand pre-filters by topic, actor, resh, over hundreds of files. Yeah, that's actually kind of nice. Um, and also just the, uh, being able to set it, let it run for a long time, and then come back to it. Yeah, I guess the report is kind of interesting, um, but we need a, a prompt that will do that. Right now, that part is gonna, is me, like I download the CSV, and then I send it, and then I ask it some stuff, but it could be kind of cool to have a generic, um, you know, like, why did you ask this list of questions question? So it's like, description of the project, and all of that can go into, I could go into this, uh, prompt that will then generate an MD file that we could then turn into, uh, either, you know, a Google Doc or a Word file, or just, you know, let them download the MD. Depends. Um, likely buyers. Woohoo! Journalists. I'm not sure, do they pay for stuff? They don't make any money. So they government advocacy, yeah, boards. Oh, actually, yeah, boards, board meetings. Okay, legal and e-discovery, great. PTAs, okay. Yeah, 50 docs. If it's $19 and it costs me $1 per video, I think 50 docs should be at least $100. Like, that doesn't, that doesn't add up. Um, yeah, overages, overages, yeah, we could do batching, uh, speed, position, okay. Okay, yeah, sounds good. Um, but also, maybe what we can do instead is also just, uh, make the data, you know, use our tool, make the data, and then just try to sell structured data. That sounds like maybe even more valuable, what do you think?",

      "content": "Yeah — you’re seeing the core tension really clearly:  \n\n- **Tool vs. Service vs. Data.**  \n  Right now you have *a tool* that works. You could sell access to it, but the economics are tricky (especially if cost ≈ \\$1/video).  \n  You could sell *a service* (reports/deliverables), which has clearer value to clients like Noor.  \n  Or you could sell *structured data outputs* — which may actually be the most scalable/defensible play.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **Tool (self-serve SaaS)**\nPros:  \n- Feels like a product.  \n- Potential for recurring revenue.  \nCons:  \n- Margins are rough if infra ≈ \\$1/video and users expect cheap pricing.  \n- Users may not want to “learn a new tool.” They just want the outcome.  \n- Journalists and small NGOs have **low budgets**.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Service (deliverables)**\nPros:  \n- Clear value (they get a usable report, no new tech to learn).  \n- Flexible pricing (you set project fees, not tied to per-video costs).  \n- Lets you iterate quietly without exposing all the tooling.  \nCons:  \n- Time-intensive for you unless you streamline the “CSV → report” step with automation.  \n- Scales slower.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Structured Data (dataset licensing)**\nThis is the sneaky opportunity. Instead of just “giving people tools,” you **become the source of already-structured intelligence**.  \n\nExamples:  \n- “Quotes from Michigan school boards 2021–2024” → \\$3k dataset.  \n- “Summary of city council meetings across 10 major metros, tagged by housing/zoning/education” → \\$10k+ dataset (urban planning consultants, real estate investors, gov agencies would buy this).  \n- “All mentions of racial equity in public education hearings, 2020–2025” → policy think tanks, NGOs.  \n\nHere, **you run the tool in bulk**, normalize the data, and sell *the dataset*. Buyers don’t care about your prompts or software—they care that they can shortcut months of manual review.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **Hybrid: Workflow + Proof**\nBest middle ground:  \n- Keep **tool access** behind the scenes for scaling.  \n- Market **reports/datasets** as the actual product.  \n- Over time, add a simple “prompt → MD report” flow (like you said: description of project → MD file → GDoc/Word). That way you can crank out structured briefs faster, or even let clients self-serve *just the reporting* layer, not the raw extraction.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **Pricing sanity check**\nYou’re right:  \n- \\$19 for 50 docs at \\$1 cost/doc = a loss.  \n- **Minimum floor should be \\$2–\\$5 per doc** if you go SaaS.  \n- Or shift pricing to **per-hour-of-audio** (simpler to explain, scales with your cost). For example:  \n  - \\$9/hr processed (break-even with margin).  \n  - \\$29/hr processed (value-based, especially for legal/compliance).  \n\nDataset licensing can be **orders of magnitude higher** because it’s one sale to one org, not 100 small users.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. **Strategic play**\n- **Short-term (Noor)**: deliver the quotes as a polished report, \\$250. That’s your service path.  \n- **Medium-term**: spin up a few more small contracts → prove there’s a *service market*.  \n- **Long-term**: batch public data (school boards, city councils, SEC filings, NGO hearings) → turn them into structured datasets → license them.  \n\nThis shifts you from “tool builder” → “data provider.” And data providers can still exist even if LLMs get better, because:  \n- Trust requires **provenance + citations**.  \n- Scale requires **automation pipelines**.  \n- Most orgs want **ready-to-use data**, not “yet another tool.”  \n\n---\n\n✨ So:  \n- Email Noor with a clean project-based offer.  \n- Keep the tool internal.  \n- Explore structured data markets (city councils, NGOs, legal discovery, ESG).  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to draft a **positioning doc** for the “structured data” angle (like a one-pager you could send to a potential buyer: *here’s the dataset, here’s how it’s structured, here’s the price*)? That way you can test if anyone bites without needing to launch SaaS right now.",

It could be a process where it asks a bunch of questions, and then it visualizes like, okay, well, it seems like you're looking for these kinds of videos, and maybe even asks them, you know, things that they don't even know. It could be like a generic YouTube to data extractor, and they say, I'm not actually sure. I think that there's information on YouTube about, you know, the housing market, and I just don't know how to get it. Can you help me? And then it talks to them for a little bit, and it helps them come up with the questions that they want to ask. It helps them come up with the search terms, because we also have a tool that searches YouTube, and then creates the lists of videos to search. And then, so it can give them a view of the list of videos that it's found in the titles, and the description, and the YouTube link, and then the list of questions that it decided on. And then from there, it can, you know, they can run it. So that could be the first thing. Maybe it can even run it on one, and then send them an email, and it's free, that one. And then they're like, oh shoot, this is valuable, you know. And then, from there, they can then decide to pay for the full report, or something like that.

      "content": "Yes! You’ve just described a **workflow product** with a “conversational analyst” layer on top of your extractor. That’s a much easier sell than raw SaaS or raw data because:  \n\n- **Most people don’t know what they want yet.** They have a fuzzy goal (“find housing market chatter”) but not the right queries or filters.  \n- By making the tool itself **help them articulate the question**, you’re lowering the barrier to entry.  \n- The “first taste free” (one video → email report) makes the value tangible right away.  \n\n---\n\n### What your flow could look like\n\n1. **Onboarding chat**\n   - User: “I want to understand what people are saying about the housing market.”  \n   - Tool asks: “Are you interested in city council meetings, news panels, or local community groups?”  \n   - Tool asks: “What topics matter most? (Regulations, affordability, new builds, investor activity, etc.)”  \n\n2. **Video discovery**\n   - Tool runs your YouTube searcher, shows:  \n     *title, description, channel, link* in a nice list.  \n   - Lets user prune or add more.  \n\n3. **Question building**\n   - Tool suggests queries: “Mentions of rent control,” “Stories from tenants,” “Discussions of zoning.”  \n   - User can edit/approve.  \n\n4. **Trial run**\n   - Tool processes *one video for free*, sends back a polished “mini-report” to email.  \n   - Includes: 3–5 quotes, timestamps, speaker role (if inferable), and source link.  \n\n5. **Upsell**\n   - “Want the full set of 25 videos processed into a report? \\$49”  \n   - Or “Subscribe for \\$99/mo for up to 50 videos processed.”  \n\n---\n\n### Why this works\n- **Human-centered:** It feels like an assistant guiding you through discovery, not a blank interface.  \n- **Trust-building:** First free report shows exactly what they’ll get.  \n- **Value-first pricing:** They only pay once they’ve seen it works.  \n\n---\n\n### Potential models\n- **Casual research / individuals**: \\$49–\\$99/report.  \n- **Professional users (journalists, NGOs, PTAs, housing activists)**: \\$99–\\$299/mo for recurring searches.  \n- **Enterprise (legal, compliance, policy shops)**: \\$1k–\\$5k/mo for bulk, API access, or dataset feeds.  \n\n---\n\n### “Convivial” positioning\nThink of it as:  \n> **“Ask questions of the world’s hearings, meetings, and conversations.”**  \nInstead of raw software, you’re giving them an *experience*: “The tool helps you think, then it fetches the evidence.”  \n\n---\n\nSo maybe your MVP isn’t “just a website with upload + prompt,” but a **guided research buddy** that:  \n- helps you scope your questions,  \n- finds the sources,  \n- runs one sample,  \n- then lets you buy the rest.  \n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to sketch a **mock onboarding script** (the actual sequence of questions + screens) so you can imagine how the first user experience would feel? That way you could test it with Noor or someone else right away.",
