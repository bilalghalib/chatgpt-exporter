      "content": "\"Nido\" is a brand of powdered milk produced by Nestlé. It's made primarily from cow's milk that has been pasteurized and then dried through a process known as spray drying. During this process, the milk is rapidly heated and then cooled, causing it to evaporate quickly and leaving behind dry milk solids. The key components of powdered milk like Nido are the same as in regular milk, primarily consisting of milk proteins, lactose (milk sugar), and milk fat, although the fat content can vary depending on the specific type of powdered milk (full-fat, reduced-fat, or non-fat).\n\nIf you're interested in making your own homemade powdered milk, it's a bit more challenging than creating instant tea or coffee mixes due to the complexity of the drying process. Commercial production involves specialized equipment to remove moisture while preserving the milk's nutritional quality. However, you can create a simple milk powder mix for specific recipes or purposes. Here's a basic guideline:\n\n### Ingredients\n- Regular milk (whole, reduced-fat, or non-fat, depending on preference)\n\n### Instructions\n1. **Dehydrate the Milk**: Use a dehydrator or an oven set to the lowest possible temperature. Pour the milk into shallow trays and dehydrate until completely dry. This process can take several hours.\n   \n2. **Grinding**: Once the milk is fully dehydrated and brittle, grind it into a powder using a blender or a food processor.\n\n3. **Storage**: Store the homemade milk powder in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.\n\n### Notes\n- Homemade milk powder might not be as fine or evenly textured as commercial products.\n- The process can be time-consuming and might not be cost-effective compared to buying pre-made powdered milk.\n- The shelf life of homemade milk powder may not be as long as commercial products due to the potential for residual moisture.\n\n### Simplified Mixes\nFor a \"one mix\" solution similar to Nido, you can blend your homemade milk powder with additional ingredients for specific recipes (like a hot chocolate mix, a baking mix, etc.). Just remember that the texture and behavior of homemade powdered milk might differ slightly from commercial powdered milk in recipes.",

The term has since been adopted more broadly in everyday language to describe anyone who is missing from their usual responsibilities or place without a known reason or permission. For example, if an employee doesn't show up for work without notifying their employer, they might be described as \"going AWOL.\"",
