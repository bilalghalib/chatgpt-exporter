      "content": "To consolidate the eight original levels into four while maintaining the essence of each, we can group them based on their overarching themes and objectives. Here's a proposed reduction and renaming, with descriptions and reasoning:\n\n1. **Inception & Exploration (combines 1: Discover and 2: Explore)**  \n   *Description:* This stage is about discovering personal qualities, interests, and potential. It involves recognizing various problems and needs for creative solutions and developing individual skills and attitudes. It also includes exploring different approaches to problems, emphasizing diversity, and developing social skills.\n   *Reasoning:* Both levels are about the early stages of personal and entrepreneurial development, focusing on self-awareness, problem identification, and exploring diverse solutions.\n\n2. **Experimentation & Action (combines 3: Experiment and 4: Dare)**  \n   *Description:* This stage emphasizes critical thinking and experimenting with creating value through practical experiences. It also involves turning ideas into action in real-life scenarios and taking responsibility for these actions.\n   *Reasoning:* These levels are transitional phases where theoretical knowledge and ideas are tested through experimentation and then implemented, requiring a shift from thought to action.\n\n3. **Growth & Collaboration (combines 5: Improve and 6: Reinforce)**  \n   *Description:* Focuses on improving skills for turning ideas into action and taking increasing responsibility for creating value. It includes working with others, using knowledge to generate value, and dealing with complex challenges.\n   *Reasoning:* This stage represents the maturation of skills and ideas. It combines the refinement of individual capabilities with the importance of teamwork and facing more complex challenges.\n\n4. **Expansion & Transformation (combines 7: Expand and 8: Transform)**  \n   *Description:* Concentrates on competencies needed to handle complex, changing environments with high uncertainty. It involves developing new knowledge through research and innovation to achieve excellence and transform existing paradigms.\n   *Reasoning:* These final levels are about mastery and leadership, where skills and knowledge are applied to navigate and innovate in uncertain, complex environments, leading to transformational changes.\n\nBy this restructuring, the journey from personal discovery to transformative action is maintained, with each new stage building upon the foundations of the previous ones. The reduced number of levels still encapsulates the original intent and progression of the eight levels, but in a more streamlined and integrated manner.",

The question should be comprehensive yet simple to answer, and the evidence should be straightforward to provide.\n\n**Appropriate Question for Level 1:**\n\"How have you demonstrated your curiosity and initial steps in creative thinking and problem-solving in a recent project or activity?\"\n\nThis question is broad enough to encompass all aspects of the initial stage of creativity, including being curious and open, developing initial ideas, approaching problems, designing basic value, and recognizing innovation. It's simple enough for someone at the inception stage to answer, as it does not require advanced knowledge or experience.\n\n**Evidence for Level 1:**\n1. **Curiosity Log:** A journal or collection of notes where the learner has recorded their observations, questions, and reflections on new things or subjects they are curious about.\n2. **Idea Sketches:** Simple sketches or mind maps of initial ideas the learner has come up with, relevant to problems or needs they have identified.\n3. **Problem Identification Document:** A brief write-up or list where the learner has identified and described a problem or an area for improvement in their surroundings.\n4. **Value Creation Attempt:** Photos, descriptions, or prototypes of simple objects or solutions created to add value to the learner or their immediate community.\n5. **Innovation Recognition:** A list or collage of innovative products, services, or solutions the learner has found and why they consider them innovative.\n\nThese pieces of evidence are tangible yet straightforward enough for someone at the inception and exploration stage of their creative development. They provide a clear indication of the learner's engagement with the foundational aspects of creativity.",

      "content": "Each level should address the majority of the threads for creativity. The table that follows describes the different threads of the competency creativity for each level. First let us think step by step and identify the most appropriate question for level 1 through five and evidence given the diverse threads within. What is a minimum maximum comprehensive question that is simple to answer and simple to give evidence for. Give the results in a tabular format. \n\n\nTable: Thread\tFoundation\t\tIntermediate\t\tAdvanced\t\tExpert\t\nBE CURIOUS AND OPEN\tI can show that I am curious about new things.\tI can explore new ways to make use of existing resources.\tI can experiment with my skills and competences in situations that are new to me.\tI can actively search for new solutions that meet my needs.\tI can actively search for new solutions that improve the value-creating process.\tI can combine my understanding of different contexts to transfer knowledge, ideas, and solutions across different areas.\t\t\nDEVELOP IDEAS\tI can develop ideas that solve problems that are relevant to me and my surroundings.\tAlone and as part of a team, I can develop ideas that create value for others.\tI can experiment with different techniques to generate alternative solutions to problems, using available resources in an effective way.\tI can test the value of my solutions with end users.\tI can describe different techniques to test innovative ideas with end users.\tI can set up processes to involve stakeholders in finding, developing, and testing ideas.\tI can tailor a variety of ways of involving stakeholders to suit the needs of my value-creating activity.\tI can design new processes to involve stakeholders in generating, developing, and testing ideas that create value.\nDEFINE PROBLEMS\tI can approach open-ended problems (problems that can have many solutions) with curiosity.\tI can explore open-ended problems in many ways so as to generate multiple solutions.\tI can take part in group dynamics aimed at defining open-ended problems.\tI can reshape open-ended problems to fit my skills.\tI can describe and explain different approaches to shaping open-end- ed problems and different problem-solving strategies.\tI can help others create value by encouraging experimentation and using creative techniques to approach problems and generate solutions.\tI can initiate, develop, manage and complete a creative project.\tI can use a mix of creative techniques to keep generating value over time.\nDESIGN VALUE\tI can assemble objects that create value for me and others.\tI can improve existing products, services and processes so that they better meet my needs or those of my peers and the community.\tI can identify the basic functions that a prototype should have to illustrate the value of my idea.\tI can assemble, test and progressively refine prototypes that simulate the value I want to create.\tI can create (alone or with others) products or services that solve my problems and my needs.\tI can develop and deliver value in stages, launching with the core features of my (or my team’s) idea and progressively adding more.\tI can apply different design approaches to create value through new products, processes or services.\tI can design and put in place innovative processes to create value.\nBE INNOVATIVE\tI can find examples of innovative products, services and solutions.\tI can describe how some innovations have transformed society.\tI can tell the difference between types of innovations (for example, process versus product innovation and social innovation, incremental versus disruptive innovation).\tI can judge if an idea, product or process is innovative or just new to me.\tI can describe how innovations diffuse in society, culture and the market.\tI can describe different levels of innovation (for ex- ample, incremental, breakthrough or transformational) and their role in value-creating activities.\tI can identify the steps needed to research the potential for an innovative idea in light of its development into an existing enterprise, a new venture or an opportunity for social change.\tI can manage in- novation processes that respond to emerging needs and make the most of opportunities as they become available.",

      "content": "Based on the threads for creativity and the corresponding levels of competency, we can devise a comprehensive yet simple question for each level, along with a type of evidence that would be suitable to demonstrate proficiency at that level. The goal is to ensure the question and evidence are broad enough to encompass most of the threads while being specific enough to be meaningful.\n\nHere's the tabular format for each level:\n\n| Level             | Question                                                                                                            | Evidence                                                    |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Foundation        | Can you show how you've been curious and open to new things, and how this has led to the development of an idea?   | A journal or portfolio showcasing curiosity-led activities, ideation notes, or sketches. |\n| Intermediate      | How have you explored new ways and experimented with your skills to develop and improve ideas or solutions?         | A project or case study detailing the exploration and experimentation process. |\n| Advanced          | Can you demonstrate how you've defined and approached open-ended problems and tested the value of your solutions?   | A presentation or report on problem-solving strategies, including feedback from tests or trials. |\n| Expert            | How have you combined your understanding of different contexts to design innovative processes or solutions?         | A comprehensive project or innovation portfolio showing cross-contextual applications and stakeholder involvement. |\n\nThis table provides a clear, progressive pathway from foundational curiosity and idea development to expert-level innovation and design. The evidence requested aligns with the complexity and depth of understanding expected at each stage, ensuring a thorough demonstration of the creativity competency.",
