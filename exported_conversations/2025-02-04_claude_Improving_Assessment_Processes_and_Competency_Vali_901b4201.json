The Accelerator program aims to build the enterprises’ capacity with weekly training and mentorship facilitated by Bloom in partnership with the Asfari Foundation. Participating enterprises will develop their ideas and prototypes into functioning business ideas through Bloom’s online platform, training pedagogy, networks of experts, and customized curriculum. \n\nWhat are the key dates:\nPublic Launch and Applications Open on  Feb 3, 2025\nOpen house starts on  Feb 13, 2025\nThe application deadline is Feb 24, 2025\nEnterprises are notified of selection into the Bootcamp by  Mar 3, 2025\nBootcamp begins on  Mar 13, 2025\nBootcamp Demo Day is on  Apr 3, 2025\nEnterprises are notified of selection into Accelerator by April 11, 2025\nAccelerator begins on April 22, 2025\nDemo day is on/around August 12, 2025\n\nWhat benefits do I receive from the program?\nFunding up to $3,830 to support an essential aspect of the business could improve growth and sustainability. \nTraining, mentorship, and other support during the three-month accelerator program \nLifetime access to Bloom’s resources and network of entrepreneurs, including mentors, investors, alums, and staff\nDemo day exposure and other investor connections\n\nHow can we get funded after the program ends?\nWe provide the seed funding to get you going, but you may need more funding to continue your enterprise efforts. Near the end of the accelerator program, we’ll organize a Demo Day to help connect you with investors, funders, and organizations that could help you in the following stages of your enterprise journey. We’ll coach you so you’re as effective as possible and do everything we can to help get you follow-on support and funding. \n\nWhat language is the content delivered for the program?\nThe primary language in verbal and written communications during accelerator activities is English. However, we can also offer support and mentorship in Arabic or French. We may adapt these during the program to respond to enterprises' needs. \n\nWhat is a typical day and week for a team during the program?\nIt’s your enterprise, so you’ll be hard at work on your business, the product, marketing, HR, etc. We’ll have between one and three weekly sessions, from formal workshops to informal discussions with our mentors, trainers, and guests. Some of those are “required,” but many are optional, and we expect enterprises to adapt and join the critical sessions for issues they’re dealing with in their enterprise. We’ll also regularly have required check-ins with each enterprise, usually every month. \nIn general, though, you’ll be working on your enterprise each day, just like all of the other founders in the program. We don’t tell you what to do or when, but we create an environment conducive to helping your enterprise daily. And we’ll ensure you have many experienced mentors around to help you.\n\nWhat kind of enterprises are we looking for?\nSocial enterprises with specific areas of focus in sustainability, good governance, independent media, active citizenship, lifelong learning, innovation, and systems change.\n\nHow do you choose which enterprises to accept into the program?\nThis varies per program.\nWe will use the following criteria to assess eligible applications. These are not all requirements, but preferences and enterprises will be weighed on the different elements:\nImpact: What difference will your idea make, and for whom? How many jobs will you create, what sort of marginalized communities will you impact, and whether you align with the priority impact areas?\nCapacity: What skills, knowledge, and resources do you have to develop and deliver your idea?\nFeasibility: Can you realistically deliver your idea by the end of the program and within budget?\nSustainability: Whether your idea has the potential to become financially sustainable and last beyond the lifetime of the funding we provide.\nStage of Enterprise and Product: Whether the enterprise is already generating revenue and the stage of development of the specific product or branch that this program will support.\nInclusion and user testing: Whether the voices of your target clients have been included in the prototype/solution design and whether your client base includes different demographics, backgrounds, sexes, etc.\nInnovation and growth potential: Whether your idea is new and different, and where or how it can grow.\n\nWhat kind of enterprises are eligible for the program?\nYour enterprise is eligible if it meets the following criteria:\nYour enterprise is in the idea or prototype stage\nMore than one person in the team, with at least two team members working full-time in the enterprise.\nNo restrictions on sociographic or other parameters regarding the applicants.\nFemale-led enterprises and enterprises with higher diversity (age, sex, socio-economic background, refugee/host communities, location around Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, and Syrian diaspora, etc.) are particularly encouraged to apply. \nWe are unable to support\nEnterprises of only one individual. \nEnterprises engaged with other entrepreneurship/innovation programs/accelerators, unless there is a clear distinction between the program offerings, and enterprises can demonstrate that they have time and capacity to join this program in addition to their other program commitments.\n\nWhat stage of enterprises is eligible for the program?\nImagine a spectrum of entrepreneurship running from learning about the concepts and skills to having a mature enterprise changing the world. Those stages are categorized as follows. For the sake of this challenge, we will focus on supporting enterprises as indicated in yellow below:\n\nEnterprise Development Stages\nStages\nSub-Stages\n0. LEARNING\t\n0.1. Learning without the goal of launching an enterprise\n1. IDEATION\n1.1. Want to start and looking for/testing ideas\n2. IDEA-STAGE\n2.1. Exploring ideas, conducting market/customer research \n2.2. Have started developing my idea\n3. PROTOTYPE (has concept, no revenues)\n3.1. Have an early (low-fidelity/paper) prototype (of product or service)\n3.2.  Have a functioning (high-fidelity) prototype with early users / early adopters\n4. EARLY-STAGE (have revenues, but not profitable)\n4.1. Declining revenues and the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.2. Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but the enterprise is not however profitable/sustainable\n4.3. Revenues are growing quickly, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n5. GROWTH-STAGE (profitable)\n5.1. Established national enterprise (profitable/sustainable business, with stable, growing, or declining revenues)\n5.2. Established multinational enterprise\n5.3. Seeking scalability (of impact and/or profits)\n5.4. Seeking diversification \n\n\nWhat does the program look like?\nYou will get access to an empowering program that will include monetary prizes, mentoring, access to opportunities, and more.\nOpen House\nOnline discussions and “info sessions” with thought leaders to build awareness and momentum around the program. \nSelection process\nBootcamp\nHigh-intensity two-week-long Bootcamp with workshops, mentorship, and support for all enterprises. \n1-on-1 follow-ups with the enterprises\nBootcamp Demo Day\nFinal selection\nAccelerator\nWeekly or bi-weekly workshops adapted to the needs of the cohort and enterprises\nRegular milestone check-ins with all enterprises\nMentorship coordination\nOnline or offline Demo Day, or otherwise optimized for the interests of partners and the needs of the enterprises to help the enterprises continue their growth path. \n"

Regarding the balance between automated/systematic collection versus human judgment:\n- For this program, with 13 social enterprises across multiple countries, we need an efficient yet thorough validation process\n- Automated collection could work well for the Bootcamp phase (March 13-April 3) where rapid feedback is needed\n- Human judgment through mentors becomes more critical during the accelerator phase (April 22-Aug 12) where deeper development happens\n- Suggestion: Use automated assessments during bootcamp for quick wins, then transition to more mentor-based validation during the accelerator, particularly around the monthly check-ins mentioned in the program structure\n\n2. For integrating program activities into assessment:\n- The program already has natural assessment points: bootcamp demo day (April 3) and monthly check-ins\n- The $3,830 grant component provides a built-in opportunity to assess progress through work plan achievement\n- Suggestion: Build the evidence collection around these existing touchpoints rather than creating new ones. For example, demo day presentations could automatically count as evidence for communication competencies\n\n3. Looking at other industries' competency validation:\nFor this social innovation context, we could adapt:\n- The aviation industry's use of specific observable behaviors (\"competency markers\") for each skill\n- The maritime industry's three-part framework (Knowledge + Skills + Experience)\n- But keep it accessible by focusing on the program's existing deliverables as evidence\n\nNew questions based on the ACSI4 context:\n\n1.

            "extracted_content": "Program Management Guide\nA step-by-step guide to running accelerator programs using the Bloom Framework\n\nTable of Contents\nIn Document Outline in the left sidebar.\n\nIntroduction \nThis guide aims to be a living, breathing organism built as an open-source project. We created it to help accelerators and program managers focus on impact and inclusive entrepreneurship in developing/emerging ecosystems through skill-based and character-based support. \nHow to use this step-by-step guide?\nRunning accelerator programs is a young and evolving field. With limited proven research into best practices, we do not wish to claim a set formula or one-size-fits-all approach. Accelerator models vary significantly depending on their objectives. \nInstead, the guide aims to help program managers understand some of the critical choices and challenges they'll need to consider if they're considering building a program of their own. It combines lessons from previous practices and patterns we identified over the years to highlight and frame the strategic choices facing stakeholders interested in creating and running these programs. \nWe developed this guide into two sections:\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻\nThis section will help you understand our framework and assessment suite.\nSection 2: Running an Accelerator Program 🌟\nThis section covers the critical aspects of creating and running an accelerator in six simple stages. Each stage comes with a series of toolkits to help you think about your plans and the context of accelerator design.\n\n\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻 \nAlso here: Bloom Framework v0.9 - Two Pillars (draft)\nBloom's Training Framework offers a dynamic, adaptive learning environment for individuals, teams, and organizations through a guided project-based and cohort-based learning approach. It focuses on two core pillars:\nThe Individual: Featuring Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH), Universal Skills, Character Strengths, and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessments.\nThe Organization: Featuring the Organizational Development Assessment.\nThe framework helps assess core strengths and weaknesses, prioritizing areas for learning and development. Our goal is to simplify the creation of custom learning journeys, enabling teams and program managers to identify optimal learning opportunities, foster a supportive environment, and positively impact businesses.\nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for improvement across both pillars, ensuring simultaneous development and, for example, improving an individual's skill through activities that address core organizational needs.\nEntrepreneurs identify their priority development areas based on assessment results and customize their learning journey with program managers, co-creating a tailored curriculum for the cohort.\nOur framework is based on proven cohort-based and project-based learning methods combined with the power of mentorship. Peer learning enhances the experience, while project-based learning aligns objectives with a mission or vision, fostering intrinsic motivation. Using a flipped classroom approach, entrepreneurs first digest relevant content, reflect on their learnings, and apply them in their enterprises. They then meet with their cohort for peer feedback and mentorship, using what they learn in real-life settings.\nOur programs nurture individual and organizational development, promoting cooperation over competition and leveraging collective intelligence to solve pressing societal problems.\nThe Bloom Training Framework is versatile and can be used in various contexts, including companies, educational programs (youth, school, university), startup accelerators, and short events like startup sprints or hackathons.\n\nOur Principles\nWe use the following guiding principles to evaluate and prioritize program activities:\nKeep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat. (Upside down pyramid) \\/\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the teams in our programs to help them do the right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on extraneous, nonaligned activities. We want to keep the teams and participants in the driver's seat and help them develop decision-making skills. We can help people develop skills of effectiveness by creating an enabling environment. \nTransformation > Information. Make available knowledge actionable. (Library content)  \nPrioritizing transformative learning experiences over mere information dissemination ensures that knowledge is applied in meaningful ways. By providing actionable insights and practical tools, we create an environment where learning translates into real-world impact.\nGet the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessments)\nOptimizing team composition by aligning individual strengths and roles enhances overall team effectiveness. Through comprehensive assessments, we identify key areas for personal and professional growth, enabling targeted interventions that maximize individual and collective potential.\nWhy integrate individual growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team is determined by the development of each individual who comprises it. So, while personal development and well-being are also an end, we ensure that the teams are more robust and the organization is more likely to keep going. Instilling such resilience helps cultivate values-driven people and a community of social change makers with a growth mindset and a contributor attitude. \nCreate an enabling environment in the program and support the broader ecosystem.\nFostering a supportive community within cohort-based programs is essential for creating an enabling environment where entrepreneurs can thrive. By nurturing a culture of collaboration and mutual support, we enhance the learning experience and contribute to the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem. We win when we win together. \n\nPillar 1: The Individual\nBloom recommends the following individual development assessments:\nWellbeing & Engagement: at work & in life (through PERMAH)\nEntrepreneurship & Leadership Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of entrepreneurship and leadership \nCharacter Strengths: through VIA, Values in Action \nUniversal Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of work and life)\n 1.1. Wellbeing & Engagement \nOur Wellbeing and Engagement assessment is rooted in the principles of positive psychology and aims to measure human flourishing. This assessment evaluates six critical dimensions. These dimensions are essential indicators of a well-lived life, each contributing uniquely to an individual's overall sense of wellbeing.\nPositivity: Measures the extent to which an individual experiences positive emotions, crucial for enhancing resilience and overall mental health.\nEngagement: Assesses the level of involvement and absorption in activities, reflecting a flow state where individuals are fully immersed and find deep satisfaction.\nRelationships: Evaluates the quality of an individual's connections with others, recognizing that supportive and fulfilling relationships are fundamental to wellbeing.\nMeaning: Gauges the sense of purpose and direction in life, indicating how much individuals feel their lives have significance and contribute to something greater.\nAchievement: Measures the accomplishment of goals and the sense of mastery, highlighting the importance of setting and achieving personal and professional objectives.\nHealth: Assesses physical wellbeing, acknowledging that a healthy body is essential for overall life satisfaction.\nUsing the PERMAH framework, we ensure our programs focus on professional success and personal flourishing. This approach helps individuals and organizations achieve sustainable success by aligning personal wellbeing with organizational goals. \n1.2. Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\nThe Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessment evaluates proficiency in recognizing opportunities, mobilizing resources, and taking effective action in various contexts. This assessment is based on the EntreComp framework, a comprehensive tool developed by the European Commission to promote entrepreneurship education and training. EntreComp offers a common reference framework that defines the key competencies necessary for entrepreneurial behavior and mindset.\nWe use the EntrepComp framework to help people build skills along six dimensions:\n\n1.3. Character Strengths \nCharacter strengths are invaluable tools that guide us in developing skills and enhancing our effectiveness in any endeavor. Leveraging these strengths makes learning new things more accessible and enjoyable. In Bloom programs, we use the Values in Action (VIA) Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their “Signature Strengths.” These strengths appear naturally and authentically, providing energy rather than requiring effort. Using our Signature Strengths promotes well-being and vitality in the workplace, leading to greater engagement and productivity. The VIA assessment analyzes virtues and values across cultures, identifying 24 universally recognized character strengths. These strengths are clustered into six core virtues:\n\nWisdom and Knowledge: Creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective, and innovation. These strengths enable us to gain and use knowledge effectively.\nCourage: Bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality, and zest. These strengths help us face challenges and pursue goals despite obstacles.\nHumanity: Love, kindness, and social intelligence. These strengths foster meaningful and supportive relationships with others.\nJustice: Citizenship, fairness, and leadership. These strengths contribute to a just and equitable community.\nTemperance: Forgiveness and mercy, humility, prudence, and self-control. These strengths help us regulate our behaviors and emotions.\nTranscendence: Appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, and spirituality. These strengths connect us to something greater and provide a sense of purpose and meaning.\nBy identifying and using our Signature Strengths, we can bring energy and positivity to our work, fostering a thriving and productive environment. This approach to personal development ensures that individuals achieve professional success and lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.\n1.4. Universal Skills.  \nUniversal Skills are competencies that benefit individuals across all organizational sectors and roles. These skills are critical to our personal development framework, ensuring team members can thrive regardless of their specific personal or professional requirements. Our approach to developing Universal Skills is guided by the Universal Skills Framework from SkillsBuilder.org, which categorizes these skills into four key dimensions:\nCommunication: Enhancing the ability to convey ideas clearly and effectively fostering better understanding and collaboration.\nProblem Solving: Equipping individuals to analyze situations, identify challenges, and develop practical solutions, thereby improving decision-making and innovation.\nSelf-Management: Developing personal discipline, time management, and resilience to navigate complex tasks and maintain productivity under pressure.\nTeamwork: Cultivating the skills necessary for effective collaboration, including empathy, cooperation, and working harmoniously in diverse teams.\nFocusing on these four dimensions ensures that our team members are equipped with versatile skills applicable in any context. This development approach enhances individual performance and contributes to our organization's overall effectiveness and adaptability. Using the Universal Skills Framework, we provide structured and targeted training that supports continuous personal and professional growth, ensuring that our teams are well-prepared to meet the demands of the modern workplace.\nHow To Apply the Individual Development Framework:  \nRequest your participants to take the Bloom Individual Development assessments on the Bloom Platform, which include Universal Skills, Well-being and Engagement, and Character Strengths.\nIn program cycles, discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers can help participants identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from their knowledge, online resources, or the Bloom Library of Activities. \nFor Character Strengths:\nAfter the individuals take the Character Strengths assessments, you can request individuals and teams to identify their Signature Strengths.\nOnce they’ve identified their Signature Strengths, request individuals to select a priority area within their Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills results on the Bloom Learn tab.\nEnd-of-program assessments help participants and program managers see growth and chart paths for further improvement.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Bloom Personal Framework involves critical skills and values that help you be effective as a person.\nIt includes Well-being & Engagement, Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills, Character Strengths and Universal Skills.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nUniversal Skills – Bloom\nWellbeing and Motivation – Bloom\nCharacter Strengths – Bloom\n\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nThe Skills Builder Partnership\nPermah Survey Home - The PERMAH Wellbeing Survey\nVIA Character Strengths Survey & Character Reports | VIA Institute\n\nPillar 2: The Organization\nBloom recommends the following organizational development assessment:\nThe Organizational Development Assessment is a way to assess your enterprise’s organizational status and needs quickly. Teams use it as a self-assessment tool, a guided collaborative process, or program managers can do third-party assessments.\n2.1. Organizational Development  \nOrganizational Capacity is the ability of an organization to achieve its mission while anticipating and managing future changes and risks. Our Organizational Capacity Assessment is derived from established methodologies by international consulting firms, tailored specifically for enterprises and accelerators. Bloom’s Organizational Capacities assessment helps organizations identify blind spots, providing a 360-degree perspective on their current state and guiding them in selecting development areas that will have the most impact. We offer adapted versions of the assessment for enterprises, early-stage enterprises, and accelerators.\nThe Organizational Capacity Assessment categories are:\n\n🎯 Strategy\n📲 Products and Services\n💶 Revenues, Financial Management & Sustainability\n🫶🏽 Corporate Social Responsibility\n🤝 Community Engagement & Communication\n🧑 Team, Leadership, Staff & Volunteers\n👨‍🏫 Innovation & Learning\n🧑🏽‍⚖️ Legal & Compliance\n⚠️ Infrastructure, Risk, Security & Resilience\n\nWhy a Self-Assessment?\nSelf-assessments provide rich information about organizational capacity and inform performance monitoring plans. They are primarily tools for capacity strengthening rather than performance evaluation. A critical aspect of a participatory assessment is fostering a safe space where staff can freely discuss an enterprise’s issues and priorities without fear of consequences when highlighting organizational weaknesses, challenges, and needs for improvement. In summary, self-assessment is a self-diagnosis process where an enterprise reflects on its performance, identifies priorities and goals, and sets a path toward achieving benchmarks. An Enterprise Capacity Assessment supports organizational decision-making and ownership of the capacity development process.\nResults Debrief and Analysis\nThe purpose of this step is to analyze the results with the assessment group so the enterprise can digest and understand the results and compare its current capacity against its longer-term goals. The presentation and discussion of results should be non-judgmental and positive. \nSuggested Steps:\nOpen the session and welcome everyone \nExplain the purpose of this meeting.\nReiterate that all results are indicators rather than performance assessments and encourage continued active participation\nDiscuss and analyze the results\nDiscuss each category with questions such as\nWhat is your reaction to these results? Are there any surprises?\nWhat are your observations about the enterprise’s overall capacity in this category?\nAre the scores for each indicator polarized or consistent with each other? Why?\nWhat is the enterprise doing well? What can the enterprise learn from success in this area?\nSummarize the discussion by highlighting the most surprising results or eliciting the most significant difference in opinion. \nReflect on the assessment results\nAsk the participants to discuss the following questions::\nWhat are our most important issues or weaknesses as an enterprise?\nWhat is causing these issues?\nIdentify key capacity issues revealed during the assessment.\nLook for root causes of issues, not just symptoms.\nIdentify issues common to multiple capacity areas.\nPriority Setting and Action Planning\nThis step helps the enterprise prioritize the issues identified during the assessment for inclusion in the Organization's Development Plan. \nSuggested Steps:\nLink the problems identified with the objectives\nStart with a discussion using these prompts\nDo you think any of the issues identified are more critical than others? Why?\nWhich categories or sub-categories would foster the most significant change in bringing the enterprise closer to its vision and goals?\nAsk the participants to vote on which objective they consider priorities over the next cycle and which should be in the Organization's Development Plan.\nExplain that the number of categories or subcategories to include depends on the time to implement the plan, the complexity of activities, and the resources required. Encourage the group to be pragmatic. \nIdentify key results and significant initiatives for each objective.\nWhat relevant milestones would your enterprise expect to achieve within the program timeframe?\nHow To Apply the Organizational Development Framework:  \nThe program manager invites teams and participants to take the relevant Organization Capacities assessment on the Bloom platform (Enterprise Capacities or Accelerator Capacities). \nAfter participants take the assessment, they are requested to go over their results and discuss with their team, mentor, and program manager to select their priority areas of development and the particular objectives they would like to achieve during the program. \nThe Organization Development Plan is documented using Bloom’s template for the duration of the program and is a shared document between the teams, the mentors, and the program manager. \nRegular progress check-ins during program cycles help the team, mentors, and program managers stay on track, adjust where needed, solve problems, and track progress.\nTeams periodically take the assessment (whole or just for their priority development areas) to celebrate growth and improvements!\n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Bloom framework's second pillar is organizational development. It includes the “doing” work of a person, team, or organization and the skills that help a team flourish. \nIt includes the ​​CAT (Capacity Assessment Tool) system, with specific assessments using categories and questions adapted to the needs of teams and programs. \n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nECAT – Bloom\nProgram Dashboard for [Team Name] Template - Enterprise Capacities v1.1\n\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nAssessing your strengths and weaknesses with the McKinsey Organizational Capacity Assessment Tool (OCAT)\n\n\nSection 2: Running A Program\nStage 0: Preparations\nIn this section, we provide basic information on how accelerators operate. It covers the critical aspects of creating and finalizing program basics.\nProgram Design\nWe can adapt our programs to meet the partner's objectives best, whether for economic development, education, impact/CSR purposes, corporate development, staff training, corporate innovation/intrapreneurship, or others. We refine each approach to design the best program to deliver the desired results. \nSome program design parameters include \nNumber of Teams: Varies by partner\nWe aim to have twice as many teams in the sprint phase as a general rule\nTeam Composition: Varies by partner\nWe generally recommend having at least two team members actively working on the enterprise though it varies depending on enterprise stage.\nEnterprise Stage: From pre-idea, concept/idea stage, startup, or established enterprise. \nEnterprise Development Stages\nStages\nSub-Stages\n0. LEARNING\t\n0.1. Learning without the goal of launching an enterprise\n1. IDEATION\n1.1. Want to start and looking for/testing ideas\n2. IDEA-STAGE\n2.1. Exploring ideas, conducting market/customer research \n2.2. Have started developing my idea\n3. PROTOTYPE\n3.1. Have an early (low-fidelity/paper) prototype (of product or service)\n3.2. Have a functioning (high-fidelity) prototype with early users / early adopters\n4. EARLY-STAGE\n4.1. Declining revenues and the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.2. Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.3. Revenues are multiplying, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n5. GROWTH-STAGE\n5.1. Profitable/sustainable business\n5.2. Seeking scalability (of impact and profits)\n5.3. Seeking diversification \n5.4. Seeking an exit \n5.5. Established national enterprise\n5.6. Established multinational enterprise\n\n\nGeography: Varies by partner\nWithin an internal accelerator/entrepreneurship program or across the UAE, GCC, MENA, or global.\nFunding to Teams: Varies by partner\nImpact Areas: Varies by partner\nGenerally aligned with the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) or for other impact purposes. \nOther criteria: To determine with a partner.\nDefinition of success and program results\nBased on the objectives of the accelerator program, program managers and accelerators can get results to measure the program’s success. We list some later in this guide, but discussing them while building and designing your program is also helpful. \nThe accelerator program work plan will set the tone for program results. Each objective set is measurable and timely and allows for a quantifiable measurement of success. \nAdditionally, impact metrics can be measured depending on the program objectives, including but not limited to jobs created, revenues generated, new product launches, and more. \nProgram Communications\nDeveloping a solid brand is critical in attracting enterprises and other stakeholders. Choosing the best enterprises will lead to good results, attract good investors, and reliable applications. Targeted marketing and clear communication about the program’s criteria, what it offers, and to whom is critical. Creating a content strategy should be the first step.\nA content strategy is a plan of action purposely designed to guide content marketing activities and ensure they deliver against a specific objective. It includes content planning, production, publishing, promoting, tracking, and SEO optimization. It also consists of content you produce, such as videos, blog posts, podcasts, and social media posts. \nYou can see a sample content plan here: HerMeNow Communications Plan (draft)\nSample draft posts for this campaign here: ​​ HerMeNow posts \nThe idea is to ensure that each piece of content you produce resonates heavily with your target audience and serves to rally people behind your program’s objectives. \nSome questions to consider at this stage:\nWhich channels or events would be relevant for marketing your particular program?\nWhich networks would be most effective for reaching the type of enterprises you’d like to work with?\nHow could you communicate the criteria for your program?\nTarget Audience\nAccelerator programs must create a compelling offer to attract the most promising entrepreneurs. \nAccelerators can engage with multiple organizations, stakeholders, and channels to source and attract startups. These include\nReferral from entrepreneurs affiliated with the accelerator\nInvestors\nEntrepreneurial associations\nUniversities\nIndustry Association\nSector-specific conferences\nInbound requests from marketing efforts and social media\nOutbound direct recruiting by finding and contacting entrepreneurs on the web.\nThe quality of applications is far more critical than quantity. Attracting enterprises without growth potential or entrepreneurs for whom the accelerator has nothing to offer will be useless. \nPlanning, roles, and timeline\nWe train others to run high-impact enterprise development support programs that leverage online and in-person engagement. Every program we design has the below-standard program stages.\n\nOnce you agree with the partner on the program parameters, you can start designing the program. \nSee the toolkit at the end of this stage for the program design and planning templates.\nMentor Engagement\nMentorship is a cornerstone of growth in entrepreneurship and leadership, offering invaluable guidance, support, and networking opportunities. We do not pay our mentors to foster a culture of altruism, shared learning, and community engagement, which are critical for building resilient entrepreneurial ecosystems.\nResearch shows that intrinsically motivated mentors provide higher-quality guidance and derive greater satisfaction from mentoring. Effective mentorship builds social capital, creating networks of trust and reciprocity that benefit both mentors and mentees. Non-financial incentives, such as recognition, personal growth, and the opportunity to give back, lead to more committed and impactful mentoring relationships.\nMentors also benefit through reciprocal learning, staying updated with new trends, and gaining fresh perspectives, which enhances their leadership skills. By not monetarily compensating mentors, we emphasize the mutual benefits of mentorship grounded in intrinsic motivation and community spirit.\nA quality mentoring program is crucial for reducing the risk of enterprise failure and is a critical component of successful accelerators. We attract a diverse range of mentors with domain knowledge and entrepreneurial experience, offering two types of mentorship:\nKey Mentors: The principal mentor for a team in our programs. Program managers match you with an enterprise based on your preference and the needs of the business. You will follow the company throughout the program, meeting (online) 1-2 times per month and offering support and guidance when needed.\nTopic Mentors: Topic Mentors support teams in specific areas of expertise (e.g., marketing, HR, etc.).  \nOur mentor selection is based on referrals and direct applications, focusing on extensive entrepreneurial experience rather than academic credentials. We prioritize mentors interested in practical implementation and immediate progress, ensuring that mentoring sessions are action-oriented and impactful.\nTeams and mentors can keep track of their meetings and progress using the “mentor journal” template: Mentorship Journal for [Team Name]\nAny program needs to be monitored and assessed. The quality of mentorship can be evaluated through feedback surveys that the enterprises complete. This information is part of a feedback loop that allows constant improvement in the mentorship process.\nPartner Engagement\nThe partners’ building block consists of the network of suppliers and partners that makes the business model work.\nA successful partnership is most likely to occur when partners lay out clear guidelines at the very start. You are working with each other because partners/NGOs bring something unique and distinctive. So there must be a clear articulation of the end goal regarding the impact and the fundamental guiding principles that will keep the relationship together.\nThese include monitoring mechanisms, reporting requirements, expectations regarding shared resources and engagement levels, mutually agreed-upon communication strategies, an exit plan if things go wrong, etc. \nWe usually have the following partnerships:\nOutreach partners:\nCommunity engagement and outreach\nEngaging your community online and offline (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter networks, along with the newsletters and website) to help us source enterprises for the program.\nKnowledge partners:\nHelp provide mentors, trainers, or experts in relevant sectors or startup/enterprise development areas\nConducting online workshops (ranging from 2 hours to multi-day workshops; preferably recorded sessions), providing mentorship for participating impact startups, helping make relevant connections, etc.\nEcosystem partners:\nSupport for participating projects during the program or downstream\nThey provide additional support, resources, perks, or opportunities to the participating enterprises, whether during or after the program, such as investment/grants, partnerships/contracts, conference/visibility, services, etc. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nTo prepare for launch, program managers need to consider the following:\nTarget audience and stage of enterprises\nDefinition of success and program KPIs\nEssential program communication\nStaffing, roles, and timeline\nMentor engagement\nPartner engagement\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nProgram Design Template\nProgram Planning Template v2\nMentorship Journal for [Team Name]\nPartner MOU - All Categories - TEMPLATE\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nSTARTUP ACCELERATOR PROGRAMMES A Practice Guide\nThe Mentor Manifesto: The original “Mentor Manifesto,” created by David Cohen with the help of Jon Bradford and Brad Feld, outlines a set of principles supported by years of accelerator work and thousands of mentor interactions.\nDeconstructing the Mentor Manifesto: Brad Feld goes in depth through each component of the manifesto. \n\nStage 1: Outreach & Open House\nThe program starts with an Open House period. It refers to when a team becomes aware of the existence of an accelerator program. The accelerator’s success in this phase depends on the strength of its brand and how it markets itself. The Open House events are typically virtual and open to the public.\nOur Open Houses are a way to ask questions and get answers. You can join virtually to learn more about learning to grow in our accelerator programs and build connections. As a result, teams leave with a better understanding of our program and if it may be a good fit for them.\nOpen House Events\nDuring these 4-6 weeks, we host online webinars featuring prominent speakers sharing their experiences with aspiring entrepreneurs. It is also a space for applicants to meet and start forming a community. Here are some blog posts recapping previous open-house events.\nThere are four main reasons to run an Open House:  \nAttract, vet, and prepare applicants \nDid we attract the quality and quantity of intended teams? \nIdentify participants that may be appropriate for an online program and this program. \nHelp people become more familiar with the tools and approaches of the program. \nBring visibility to the program and the partner.\nProgram managers can record each open house event and transform it into a blog post to share on social media to attract more applicants.\nRecorded events become part of a shareable library of content accessible to the Bloom community.\nInspire and educate the potential applicants\nThe topics for the open house events are timely and relevant to the current situation to help the applicants learn something new about their trade.\nThe events are an opportunity for the program managers to present the program and for the applicants to ask questions.\nBring visibility to Bloom and engage/strengthen the Bloom community (mentors, broader startups, partners, etc.)  \nEngaging the mentors by asking them to participate as speakers \nEngaging the partners by inviting them and asking them to intervene\nShowcasing startups that have been in the program previously\nApplication Form\nChoosing which enterprises to select is one of the essential factors in the success of any accelerator. While attracting the entrepreneurs to the Open House events, we place them in a marketing funnel to submit to the second stage of the application process. This stage includes demographic information and details about the enterprise.\nDepending on your program, you can select different criteria, such as\nDemographic Data\nGender\nAge\nLocation\nNationality\nInformation about the enterprise/startup: \nWebsite and social media links \nPlease describe your company and the problem you're solving in 280 characters.\n2 min pitch\nFive slide pitch deck\nEnterprise Stage: dropdown\nAreas of development: Enterprise Capacities dropdown\nTraction\nSize of team\nInvestment Raised\nRegistration Status\nIt is essential to keep in mind that the quality of applications is far more critical than quantity. Attracting enterprises without growth potential or entrepreneurs for whom the accelerator has nothing to offer will be useless. Targeted marketing and clear communication about the program’s criteria, what it provides, and to whom are critical.\nSummarized list of things to prepare:\nBrevo Registration Form\nAutomated Email on Brevo with link to apply\nProgram on Bloom platform under the correct organization\nApplication Link on the Bloom platform\nAutomated email on Mailgun to confirm receiving their application\nAutomated Reminder Email on Brevo after they start their application to complete it\nStart here category on Bloom community program category with intro video and FAQ\nCreating the application\nStep 1: Create a form on Brevo with: First and Last Name, Email, and Company Name\nStep 2: Create an automated email that gets sent for each form submission with more details about the program and the link to the second stage application form\nCreating the second stage application form \nStep 1: Decide which fields to include in the application form.

In a nutshell, it’s a way for teams to spend a fixed amount of time on core enterprise development using today’s best practices in a coherent, integrated fashion. \nWe also sometimes run longer versions of Sprints that we call Bootcamps, usually between 4-8 weeks long. The key difference lies in the number of sessions:\nA Sprint is two weeks long and include 6 sessions (3 sessions per week) plus a Demo Day\nA Bootcamp can vary between 4 to 8 weeks:\nA 4 week Bootcamp has 3 sessions (one session per week) plus a Demo Day\nAn 8 week Bootcamp has 6 sessions (one session per week) plus a Demo Day\nIn Bloom’s standard programs, the Sprint/Bootcamp has two main objectives: \nTo help teams learn new skills and progress in their enterprise. \nTo help us learn more about the teams during our selection process for the Accelerator. \nWe’ve found that we learn more about the people and projects through a short program than through an application process and interviews. So here is how we do it:\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp allows us to assess enterprises’ strengths as we look for entrepreneurs who can overcome the obstacles necessary to build a great business. This phase helps us get to know and understand why teams have an unfair advantage over all the other candidates.\nSelection from Open House to Sprint/Bootcamp/Pre-Accelerator\nFirst, we disqualify candidates who do not check all eligibility criteria. Then, a selection committee will score the selection against the following scoring matrix.\n\nEligibility\nAssessing whether the application fits the program's eligibility criteria.\nYES / NO \nTeam \nAssessing the team’s background, capabilities to execute, and ability to gain and contribute to the program. \n/ 10\nImpact & Inclusion\nDoes the enterprise have a social impact? Can it create jobs? Does it have a positive impact on marginalized and vulnerable communities?\n/ 10\nValue Proposition\nIs the team tackling a real problem and offering a valuable solution? Does it have the ability to grow and be sustainable? Is the market potential attractive?\n/ 10\nMilestones & Traction\nCan the idea generate revenues? Have they achieved significant milestones? Has the team demonstrated it can compete?\n/ 5\nStrategy & Challenges\nDo they have a clear growth strategy? Is the program able to support the team in its current challenges?\n/ 5\nOverall Passion\nBased on the team's strength,  the project, and the potential impact it can create: how passionate are you about this application?\n/ 10\n\nSprint/Bootcamp Session Objectives\nOutlined below are some of the frameworks and tools we use during the Sprint session to help the enterprises progress on their goals and improve at least one aspect of their enterprise during the Sprint/Bootcamp sessions. \nDiscovering your Why: How do you talk about what you do?\nThe Golden Circle is a concept developed by Simon Sinek, who says, “people don’t buy what you do. They buy why you do it.”\nAccording to Sinek, most people communicate by starting with the “what” they do and eventually work their way back to talk about “how” and “why” they do what they do.\nBut companies universally identified as unique and successful think Apple or Google communicate with an “inside-out” type of thinking. \nThey start with the why, and only then do they talk about the how and what portions of what they do.\nTo use the Golden Circle for your enterprise, just help them answer three simple questions:\nWhy – Why are you doing what you are doing? For example, why are you in business, and why did you develop your product or service?\nHow – How will this help your readers? For example, what problems are you solving for your readers, and what challenges are you helping them overcome?\nWhat – What are you offering? For example, what is your product or service, and what are its features and benefits?\nAssessing: What are your priorities for the upcoming period?\nProgram managers invite the teams to take the assessments to reflect on their individual and organizational development. After reflecting on their results in their teams, program managers invite them to discuss them with their peers and mentors and start thinking about their core priority areas of development.\nGoal setting: What are your objectives for the duration of the accelerator?\nWe provide the enterprises with a framework to specify their objectives for the upcoming period they spend with us during the accelerator, usually three to four months. The enterprises must accompany these objectives with measurable key results assigned to specific team members for accountability. The enterprise can further break down objectives into particular initiatives and key activities. We recommend that enterprises work on at least one objective and up to three objectives for the duration of the accelerator. Each objective must relate to a particular organizational development topic they identified while reflecting on their priorities. \nWe invite teams to develop an Organization Development Plan stating their main objective related to their core area of organizational development. We also consider their signature character strength and overall well-being for the program duration. Teams will also develop this Organization Development Plan with a budget to help the Bloom team assess the needs accordingly.\nBudgeting: How will you use the funds allocated for the accelerator?\nWe provide enterprises with a budgeting tool to help them think about allocating their funds to the accelerator program. It allows them to think strategically about their objectives and goals, given their plans earlier during the week around the objectives and key results they aim to achieve. Funds are allocated to specific categories to help us align the overall budgets and work on economies of scale. \nPitching: How will you combine this using the Pitch Deck template?\nA pitch deck is usually a 5-10 slide presentation designed to summarize the company, the business plan, and the vision. The pitch presentation deck also serves different purposes, from meeting with a new investor to presenting in front of a stage. Each of them should follow a different structure. A demo day presentation, for example, should be very visual and contain very little text, as the entrepreneur will do all the talking. \nWe provide enterprises with a 5-10 slide deck template to adapt their branding and content accordingly. \nSelection from Sprint/Bootcamp to Accelerator\nThe program aims to help participants transform personally, professionally, and professionally. \nTo be fair, we have a 2-step process: \nStep 1: Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges \nFor the Sprint/Bootcamp phase, judges decide whether a team advances based on the team’s pitches during the online Demo Day. \nWe enlist the services of expert volunteer “Judges” who are independent and objective, with no conflicts of interest. \nThese judges review team pitches and determine each team’s potential for long-term success based on the judge’s experience and the quality of the team’s pitch during the demo day.\nJudging will take place during the online Demo Day on Zoom. \nProgram managers will share the link to submit scores with all judges before the Demo Day event. \nIf too many teams are at the end of the Sprint/Bootcamp (15 or more), it might be difficult to pitch in one group. In this case, we could split the pitch day into multiple simultaneous sessions, with up to 10 teams in a breakout session and a separate judging panel per breakout room. Representatives from each breakout session judging panel will be part of the Accelerator Selection Panel. \nWe also invite the teams to share feedback on all the pitches, though we calculate the scoring separately. \nStep 2: Accelerator Selection Panel \nPrimarily a subset of the Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges \nThe Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges' feedback will be summarized, along with the Sprint/Bootcamp Scoring Template, and shared with the Accelerator Selection Panel, which will do a final review and selection in the days following the Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day. \nAccelerator Selection Criteria\nWe measure the principles for selection with the following assessments:\nEvaluation Area\nDescription\nWeight\nEffort\nThe teams have a significant say in advancing to the next stage based on their effort during the Sprint/Bootcamp. We measure the effort according to attendance, feedback participation, and deliverables. \n1/4\nSupport\nThe teams are also scored based on how supportive they are to the other teams in the Sprint/Bootcamp. \n1/4\nCoachability\nThe team is receptive to receiving constructive criticism and will use that feedback and constructive criticism to improve their professional and organizational performance.\n1/4\nDemo Day Score\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp ends with a Demo Day where the enterprises pitch online, and judging will occur between presentations. The Judging panel will include mentors and trainers from the program and independent experts from the ecosystem. \n1/4\n\n\nThe Judges’ scores (Demo Day Score) and the Bloom team scores (Effort, Support, and Coachability) are shared with a selection panel composed of Bloom and External Experts for deliberations and donor representatives. The panel will make the final selection for acceptance in addition to the validation of support required per team. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Sprint/Bootcamp has two main objectives: \nFirst, to help teams learn new skills and progress in their enterprise. \nTo help us learn more about the teams during our selection process for the Accelerator. \nThe following frameworks guide the participants during the Sprint/Bootcamp phase:\nThe elevator pitch using the golden circle framework\nPersonal, professional, and organizational assessments\nGoal Setting\nBudgeting\nPreparing for the demo day\nThe selection process includes:\nSelecting for the Sprint/Bootcamp based on eligibility and scoring for success using metrics defined by program objectives\nSelecting for the accelerator, based on the demo day scoring and scores for effort, community, and results\nTOOLKIT: (diagnostic assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nThe Golden Circle Presentation\nECAT – Bloom\nProgram Planning Template v2\nSprint Detailed Schedule Template\nSample Program Comms\nProgram Dashboard for [Team Name] Template - Enterprise Capacities v1.1\nSprint Pitch Deck Template\nSprint Scoring Template―\nStage 3: Onboarding and Curriculum Design\nOnboarding to the Accelerator\nAfter announcing the teams that will proceed to the accelerator stage, the program manager spends time with each selected team to\nRefine their dashboards and align their objectives and initiatives with the Enterprise Capacities categories, keeping in mind the below recommendations:\nThe enterprise's objectives should align with its overall objective for the program.\nThe objectives are achievable within the timeframe of the program.\nEach objective has a key result that should be measurable with a starting value and a target value that measures progress toward an objective.\nEach initiative aligns with the set category and topics.\nThe “enterprise development topics” for initiatives are valid and aligned with the “enterprise development category” for the related objective.\nThe enterprise might be unsure how to match its objectives with the “enterprise development category.” The program manager can help them refine their dashboard during these one-on-ones\nHelp the teams add their priorities on the platform\nOnce the dashboards are clear for the team and the program manager, the team will log on to the platform and start adding their priorities:\nThe team navigates to the Growth page.\nThe team selects their priority area per their dashboard (the “Enterprise Development Category” for their first objective).\nIn the “add goal details” text box, the team adds their objective, key results, and initiatives\nExplain the individual assessments to the teams, help them identify their signature character strength, and select their priority areas for skills \nThe program manager will explain the individual assessments:\nThe teams can take the Character Strength Assessment on the Bloom Platform and identify their “Signature Strength.” It is a strength that shows up quickly and authentically, giving people energy when used rather than taking effort. Using our Signature Strengths can help us bring energy and promote well-being at work. Once they do that, they should add their Signature Strength on their dashboard so we can support them in leveraging it during the program.\nTeams can take the Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills assessment on the Bloom platform to identify areas of improvement. In discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers, they can identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from online resources or the Bloom Library of Activities. \nCustomizing the Curriculum\nWe strive to adapt the curriculum to each new cohort of enterprises that best caters to their needs. We base this customization on inputs from the Growth Page on the platform:\nOnce we complete the onboarding process, we have a clear view of all the teams’ priorities and objectives for the duration of the program, allowing us to customize the curriculum accordingly.\nThe Assessment results of each enterprise: We look at priorities selected during the onboarding and the score trends in each category.\nThe Team's Organization Development Plans: We look at the specific objective and initiatives to understand what they aim to achieve.\nAt this stage, the program manager and the training manager can design the cohort-based training activities that the teams will do during the program and prepare for the first session of the accelerator program. \nWhile we aim to find commonalities between all the teams, it is never possible to cater to everyone’s needs. Once we set the common needs, we reach out to the teams with individual needs to help them identify training activities they can do at their own pace and get feedback from mentors and trainers individually.\nLearning by Doing\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, there is nothing more important than “doing” and “testing” to understand the product, customers, and business model. At Bloom, we know how much theory we introduce to entrepreneurs versus how much time we give them to achieve results. Teaching entrepreneurs theory is inevitable — it is crucial to understand the context — but we make sure that every idea comes with a framework or a tool that entrepreneurs can use and develop over time to achieve their goals. These tools make robust theories actionable. Once we introduce them to our program, we make an effort to revisit them during the program over and over again, in the best spirit of lean startup methodology, so we make sure we are helping the startups drive progress and results.\nModular Learning\nModular learning, as the word connotes, uses learning modules that facilitate entrepreneurs learning by themselves. It is a form of distance learning that uses Self-Learning Modules based on the essential learning competencies developed by the trainers with the aid of the program and training manager.\nWhen there’s teaching, it’s tempting to sit students down in a classroom and show them what they need to know. But GALI found that “the more remote work we allow, the better.” For example, indirect learning, which focuses on the student’s inquiry and exploration rather than the teacher’s instruction, allows entrepreneurs to learn while working on their business plans and product. \nAccelerators should design curricula around things entrepreneurs do remotely that serve the dual function of teaching valuable lessons and helping advance the startup. It is better to use the time to build relationships and get feedback. Online education with e-learning modules allows founders to spend more time building networks and products.\nOnce the teams complete the training activity, we invite them to share their work in the community to get feedback from their peers and program managers. They will then join an online training session to get further feedback from their peers and expert trainers. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nCurriculums are customized according to teams’ Enterprise Capacities results, Organization Development Plan, surveys, and one-on-one interviews to identify the most present needs\nContent is created well before training sessions so entrepreneurs can learn at their own pace, apply their learning on homework, templates, and tools, and get feedback in sessions with the trainers.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nProgram Planning Template v2\nBloom Digital Library\n\nStage 4: Accelerator \nBloom Accelerator Programs Principles\nBelow are the five principles that guide the design of our accelerator programs.\nPraxis: learning happens by doing and reflecting.\nPraxis is the process by which a skill is embodied or realized. \"Praxis\" refers to engaging, applying, exercising, learning, or practicing ideas. Praxis is critical thinking that combines reflection and action.\nBloom tools: In our programs, this is applied by encouraging enterprises to record their daily tasks and activities on the Bloom task board. \nStrengths Oriented: use momentum and do more of what’s working.\nThe strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes of a person or a group rather than the negative ones. This approach builds on the entrepreneurs’ strengths, specifically seeing them as resourceful and resilient when in adverse conditions. Strengths are integral to our human identity, constituting the intrinsic and inherent qualities that define us as individuals. However, few are conscious and appreciative of them or particular about how we can best put them to use to achieve desired outcomes.\nUsing strengths energizes and motivates individuals to contribute discretionary effort towards attaining their goals. At the same time, it nourishes a feeling of achievement because they perform the things they are best at doing. Research indicates that when individuals use their strengths, they feel happier, more confident and proud, and more engaged at work. In addition, they perform better while experiencing a sense of resilience in achieving their goals. \nBloom tools: In our programs, we apply this by administering personal assessments to identify entrepreneurs’ strengths and capitalize on them through our library of activities that help build the strengths. Additionally, we developed the Enterprise Capacity Assessment to measure the organizational capacity of enterprises. It allows us to have the whole picture of the strengths of both the entrepreneur and the enterprise.\nGrowth Mindset: 1% better every day, 200% better in 70 days.\nA growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and stretching our existing abilities. Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. As a result, they tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). It is because they worry less about looking bright and put more energy into learning. \nStriving to get 1% better daily is a core tenet of the growth mindset principle. This system encourages action by breaking down big, overwhelming goals into small, discrete pieces. The small successes you experience with your baby steps feed on each other and start building momentum, leading to more prominent and significant moves.\nWe encourage our entrepreneurs to try to do just 1% better than the day before. Start small and make your increases gradual. Avoid the temptation to get impatient and start rushing forward and taking more significant leaps. Take it slow, steady, and consistent.\nSimply try to do a little better than you did the day before. Daily, just focus on getting 1% better in whatever you try to improve. That’s it. Just 1%. It might not seem like much, but those 1% improvements compound each other. \nBloom Tools: Our programs encourage entrepreneurs to look at their weekly power moves. Power Moves are the moves that take us out of our comfort zone and push us forward. Those exhilarating first steps allow us to make many more steps. Power Moves take you right out of your regularly scheduled program. They are the key to real change. They’re the most critical task that will take you one step closer to your goal.\nStep by Step: Pick a target, make it tractable, get to it, and review it.\nBreaking projects down into their parts is oft-repeated advice when tackling something big. Breaking tasks down helps us see large tasks as more approachable and doable and reduces our propensity to procrastinate or defer tasks because we simply don’t know where to begin.\nEntrepreneurs should break down the tasks to a point where they can produce a reliable estimate. Each key objective should have a clearly defined task or set of tasks. Tasks should be between 8 and 80 person-hours of labor. It is a manageable amount.\nBloom Tools: We ask our teams to prepare an Organization Development Plan that includes at least one and up to three critical objectives tied into key results and broken down into significant activities or tasks. It allows us to understand what the enterprise intends to accomplish during the accelerator period. Additionally, we encourage enterprises to use the Bloom Taskboard to record their daily tasks and keep track of their progress to accomplish what they’ve planned within their set deadlines. \nCommunity: We grow best when we grow together.\nWe rarely grow alone. Being part of an engaging community gives us a sense of belonging. It enables us to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of each other, ourselves, and our environment. Being a part of a community can make us feel like we are a part of something greater than ourselves. Providing unique opportunities for people to learn from each other and support and encouragement are invaluable in joining forces with our peers.\nBloom Tools: We aim to create a healthy community for our enterprises, starting with:\nThe teams: Being part of a community enables us to support other members. Supportive of others will help them feel good and better about themselves. \nThe mentors: An open bond with new connections builds valuable relationships and gives us a more profound sense of belonging. It helps us to reach our goals and brings a sense of security.\nThe module leaders: Communities are rich in resources. Knowing is a unique resource, and through its use, it increases in value. \nWe encourage entrepreneurs to use the inverted pyramid in the context of learning and feedback. First, they evaluate themselves, then get feedback from their mentors, and then the module leaders give feedback. \nThe general architecture of a cycle\nBloom cycles takes the best from agile and design thinking methodologies used at leading innovation companies globally. We use these in our sprint and accelerator programs to help teams develop their startup while learning leading productivity techniques.\nCycle repetitions can include some of the below elements:\nActivities and Reflections\nWeekly activities: Every other Tuesday, the program manager invites the teams to start new training activities and share their progress in the community\nEnd-of-month reflections: At the end of each month, we send the teams a reflection and feedback form to understand and gauge their progress on several KPIs related to the program’s focus. \nLive online events\nTraining sessions: Each cycle will have 2-4 training activities whereby teams will receive resources, including videos, tools, frameworks, and worksheets, to prepare them for the training sessions, where the module leader will facilitate an interactive exchange of knowledge and expertise.\nMentor support: We invite mentors to join a speed mentoring session to facilitate mentor matching. Once we match them, we invite the teams and mentors to set their meeting frequency throughout the accelerator, where they follow up on the enterprise’s progress, approve their budget, help them with their hiring needs, and others as needed.\nTypical Schedule of an Acceleration Program\nCurriculum co-creation and onboarding (1 week, two sessions).\nSession 1: Based on the onboarding sessions, we identify the cohort-based training activities of the accelerator program and present them with the modules they commit to achieving. We will put them in the driver's seat from day one, allowing us to identify standard modules & group them into sessions tackling the same topics in cohort-based activities and individual modules they are interested in tackling separately according to their enterprise needs. We also introduce them to the grant disbursement process and deep dive into best practices to plan their financial journey and ensure they are not delayed.\nSession 2: We invite the teams and mentors to join for a mentor matching session where each team meets at least three mentors. Based on their feedback forms filled at the end of the session, we will facilitate the matching for the duration of the accelerator.\nWeekly training and support (12-16 weeks, 12-16 group training sessions, and two to four individual mentorship sessions per team).\nBased on our program feedback in the last two years, we have adjusted the weekly support to cater to our teams' needs and rhythms. We build a panel of 4-5 trainers who can give general feedback on several modules in our new approach. A trainer joins in every weekly session with up to five teams at once to have enough time for deep discussions. \nDuring the weekly sessions, the teams can share what they’ve learned during the module and discuss their work related to their projects. They will receive feedback from their peers, trainers, and program managers to improve further (inverted feedback pyramid). \nIn addition, teams can book up to 4 follow-up one-on-one meetings with the trainers, mentors, and coaches to deepen the hands-on feedback further, mentoring and coaching experience at the individual and team levels. \nBased on the teams' assessment results, the curriculum will be co-created during the onboarding. After the co-creation sessions, we will select trainers, mentors, and business coaches from our Mentors and Trainers databases.\nDepending on each team’s core priorities, the curriculum might include topics that tackle questions such as \nBranding\nDo we build our brand effectively?\nProblem Solving\nHow strong is our mission?\nHave we identified what value we deliver to our customers with well-defined and aligned products and services?\nSolution Definition\nHave we identified relevant social responsibility factors for our business and industry, and are the social responsibility principles integrated into the overall corporate strategy?\nTarget Market\nHave we clearly defined who we are creating value for and who our most important customers are? \nDo we have clear strategies and channels to reach our customers? \nBasic Revenue Model\nDo we have solid financial plans and clear financial performance indicators?\nAre our revenue streams clearly defined, and how effective is our revenue generation model?\nMilestones and Next Steps\nDo we regularly read and stay on top of global business and industry trends?\nDo we have a coherent organizational strategy, including mission, vision, values, and operational plan?\nTeam\nDo we have diverse and highly skilled staff?\nAre our people (the organization's leadership and staff) satisfied and motivated in their work?\nDo we have a learning culture?\nDo we have the right people and resources (e.g., tools, budget) to provide our products/services?\nWhile some of those topics might already exist in the Bloom Digital Library, we could also commission trainers to develop additional training content if we find a gap that needs to be filled. \nWe send thank you emails to trainers after they complete the cycle to share gratitude.\nAsync accountability on the Bloom platform\nTeams can schedule mentors' sessions at their convenience, tracked on the community of the Bloom platform by posting a reflection on their notes from their mentorship journals. Teams also submit assignments to the community to hold each other responsible and accountable for the module they chose to take at the beginning of the program. Finally, the program manager will encourage the teams to review their peers’ work and give constructive and generous feedback. Indeed by looking at the same challenge from a different perspective, they are encouraged to unlearn and relearn.\nGrant Disbursement Process\nThe Grant Disbursement process will vary slightly depending on the enterprise stage and the grant amount.\nFor earlier-stage enterprises (not registered), the agreement and invoice are with individuals rather than enterprises. \nWe can apply the same basic steps to all programs:\nEnterprises sign the Agreement: \nProgram managers adapt the program agreement template and invite the teams to make a copy.\nTeams complete and sign the agreement by adding a digital signature as an image in the document.\nEnterprises refine the budget:\nThe objectives and key initiatives in the work plan should be related to the budget developed for the grant.\n70-80% of the budget is for capacity building instead of running costs.\nEnterprises get the budget approved:\nEnterprises work on improving it with their mentor and program manager. \nOnce ready and approved, the Mentor + Program manager adds their initials and the date approved on the budget.\nEnterprises get the budget signed:\nThe enterprises sign the budget in the designated cell by uploading a digital signature as an image in the cell.\nThe Program Manager, Finance Officer, and Program Lead sign the budget. \nThe enterprises send us an invoice for the amount (from the Enterprise to AltCity Impact)\nSpecific account information to include in the invoice varies:\nFor programs disbursing from the Lebanon bank account, we include the below:\nAltCity Impact / Bloom\nBeirut, Lebanon\nMOF: 3241751 (Ministry of Finance number)\nEmail: accts@bloom.pm\nDescription: Grant disbursement / Project reference: [Name of the program]\nFor programs disbursing from the UK bank account, we include the below:\nCOMPANY NUMBER: OC442441\nINCORPORATED: 25 May 2022\nREGISTERED OFFICE ADDRESS:\n71-75 Shelton Street\nCovent Garden\nLondon\nWC2H 9JQ\nUNITED KINGDOM\nWe disburse the grant in one tranche for smaller grants (2,000 USD or less).\nTo ensure proper procurement and financial management, we disbursed in 2-3 tranches for larger amounts. \nFor enterprises not yet registered, we will release the second tranche of the grant based on the progress achieved on the objectives set in the organizational development plan.\nFor registered enterprises, after receiving the first tranche, the enterprise sends all the proof of payments (invoices/bills/photos) and an updated variance report that needs to align with the Approved Budget with the next invoice for the next tranche.\nProcurement Process for Registered Enterprises\nThis process applies to registered enterprises receiving grants larger than 2,000 USD.\nPlease watch this video for detailed information: Procurement Process\nQuotations:\n$500 - $1,000: Quotation must be sent to AltCity Impact finance team as supporting document for the coming tranches.\n$1,001 and above: 3 quotations must be presented along with a quotation analysis form clearly stating the selection criteria and the selected supplier.\nInvoices:\nAll supplier invoices must be addressed to the enterprise name.\nAll invoices must be official and mention a USD amount.\nPayment:\nA payment request form must be filled out and signed before proceeding with the payment to the supplier.\nGoods received:\nOnce the purchased items are received, a good received note must be filled and submitted to the AltCity Impact finance team as a supporting document for the coming tranches.\nAll the templates for the procurement process are here.\nPurchase Category\nSupporting Documentation\nSalaries\nEmployment contract \nDebit note\nAll Consulting Categories\nConsulting Contract\nInvoice\nProof of Work \nStartup Progress report \nDebit Note \nConsulting -

Make sure to inform the teams before the session on their pitch duration so that they practice accordingly. The goal is to prevent the moderator from cutting them off publicly, but it is also essential to be strict about keeping to the time limit (possibly with a 10-15 second buffer, max). \nThe presentation order, tables, and list order on any forms should all be numbered and aligned precisely the same way. \nHave the team name, presenter’s name, team members' names, and “presentation number” of the last team on the slide to stay visible to the audience while scoring. Perhaps it could be the team’s title slide with that additional information added. \nHave different staff/team members moderating, time-keeping, making slides/music, etc. Split up roles so nobody is multitasking too much. \nIf technical limitations make it challenging to give the presenters the ability to control the shared screen, have all the teams presenting snap their fingers, so they don’t have to keep saying “next” out loud. \nThe person presenting should turn their video off if the sound is glitchy. Most importantly, their voice and the slides, though seeing them speaking would also be lovely if possible. \nEveryone turns on their microphones at the end to clap for all the teams. :-) Maybe we even do that during the opening “tadaa” to hear everyone’s voice. It is nice to do at the closing of the event as well. \nEncourage teams to present standing up, not sitting down, so they need to set up their laptop (and headphones) in a way that would allow that and not have that be at an awkward angle. \nEncourage all teams to use headphones for better sound quality. \nEncourage all teams to do some warm-up exercises before the presentation. For example, super-hero pose, jumping jacks, stretching, running in place, dance, “coffee breathing,” etc. \nMake things easy for people to switch between Zoom and Remo; create onboarding videos to share with all attendees ahead of time, and encourage them to join Remo / and sign me. \nEncourage teams a week in advance to start inviting their family/friends/future investors.\nAll teams put their username/screen name as “Team Name - Full Name.” \nUse zoom dual monitors > Show participants screen \nEncourage teams to practice, practice, practice! \nHype up the teams! :-) \nSlide Preparation for an Online Demo Day \nHaving a smooth flow between presentations is vital. Having all presentations in one Google Slides presentation can improve the flow substantially. \nIf possible, test ahead of time. You can give participants the ability to control the person sharing the screen. It will allow each speaker to control the slides themselves. However, it often doesn’t work as smoothly in practice because of technical issues, internet delays, or little comfort with the online tools. \nAdvanced Google Docs users can have the teams use separate presentations linked to one master presentation. For example, when copy-pasting from a team presentation into the main presentation, choose “linked slides.” This way, when the teams update their presentations (just those slides), the master presentation is automatically linked.\nTip: Once a presentation is in “present mode,” new changes will not show. It may be best to have an organizer “own” the team’s presentations to remove the team’s ability to edit by a particular deadline. \nHave the team name, presenter’s name, team members' names, and “presentation number” of the last team on the slide to stay visible to the audience while scoring. Perhaps it could be the team’s title slide with that additional information added. \nMake sure all teams send in a recorded pitch video before the session, just in case a team was unable to attend the demo day for any reason (medical, emergency..) or even for reasons such as having terrible internet connection and being unable to connect and join the demo day. Share the folder of “recorded pitch videos” with all the programs team and facilitators.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nOnline demo days can be as effective as in-person. There are different ways to facilitate the event online, and plenty of tools are available to help you make the most of it. \nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nN/A\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nPlanning a Virtual Demo Day: a Careful Balance of Two Worlds\nHow to run a successful inclusive online event - our Demo Day lessons\n\nStage 6: Program Closing, Continual Assessment, and Improvement\nAt the end of the program, we design certificates of completion to the teams and mentors to express our gratitude and appreciation for their support. \nA key challenge area for accelerators measures impact. As yet, an agreed framework for measuring the performance of an accelerator program does not exist, but standard metrics collected and published so far include the following:\nNumber of applications to programs\nNumber of enterprises supported\nFollow-on investment raised by enterprises\nThe survival rate of enterprises\nNumber of employees of enterprises\nNPS of the program\nWe believe that we should pay more attention to defining performance and metrics for success. Unfortunately, as startups, accelerators often lack the time and resources for such measurements, so the impact of accelerator methods is difficult to judge with limited data available. \nHere are some metrics we recommend you track:\nMonthly: For each program, data is collected monthly depending on the KPIs the program manager sets. This could include items such as\nPre and post-assessment results\nOrganization Development Plan progress and status update for each activity\nRevenues\nExpenses\nTraction (most relevant metric per enterprise)\nFeedback on this month’s accelerator activities\nEngagement\nLearning \nInspiration\nComplexity\nRelevance\nPost-Program: Program managers should collect the following data quarterly post-accelerator.\nKPIs\nFinance\nRevenue\nExpenses\nBurn rate & runway.\nCash in the bank\nEBITDA\nTraction\nChurn rate: %, an improvement of % vs. last month.\nCustomer acquisition: $\nCustomer Lifetime Value: $\nOrders per Customer: #\nTime on site before ordering\nTotal user accounts #\nActive users: #\nPaying users: #\nProduct Updates\nchanges in the product strategy, including new versions, UX/UI, new features, platform, etc. \nBusiness Updates\nWhat is relevant about people, office, partners, operations, etc.\nNew hires/fires.\nMarketing strategy.\nNew partnerships.\nInternational expansion plans.\nOperations changes.\nPress updates.\n Funding or Mergers and Acquisitions\nNotable Events\n\nKEY POINTS: \nA key challenge area for accelerators measures impact. As yet, an agreed framework for measuring the performance of an accelerator program does not exist, but standard metrics collected and published are included in this section.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nN/A\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nChoosing and Reporting Accelerator Metrics KPIs – Metabeta\n\nStage 7: Program Epilogue: Post-Program Support\nIt is easy to see the duration of the program as a set timeframe for which the demo day marks the end. But this isn’t the way that accelerators perceive it. On graduating from an accelerator program, companies are still extremely young, and potentially not yet viable for investment. Everything an accelerator program does is geared toward giving its cohorts the best possible chance of survival after graduation. So it makes sense that most offer post-program support to maintain or enhance startups’ investment viability for as long as possible. \nIt can typically include the following:\nPublic relations opportunities\nConnections with investors\nBoard participation\nHR/recruitment support\nLocal meet-ups\nOnline communities with funding and promotion opportunities\nOffice space\nAlumni Network\nAll accelerators acknowledge their alumni network as a valuable asset of the program: maintaining an alumni database is, therefore, a priority. Some host online communities and alumni events to create and develop the alumni network. Others call on the help of alumni when selecting a new cohort of potential startups. There is also the phenomenon of recycling founders, where startups take in unsuccessful alumni as members of their team if they consider them valuable.\nFollow-on Investment\nAccelerated startups still struggle with gaps between seed funding and successfully raising Series A investment. To help combat this, some accelerators offer to follow–on investment once the program is finished; they can sometimes go some way towards bridging funding gaps. This could be by providing staged investments or an additional capital infusion after graduation.\nMentorship, Perks, and Opportunities\nOnce enterprises are part of an accelerator. They will be part of the community for life. They can expand their business and network with access to a talented group of founders, investors, mentors, and industry leaders. Additionally, the accelerator will typically have onboarded perks partners, providing the enterprises with discounts and access to helpful resources. Finally, keeping in touch with the accelerator community can be beneficial as program managers often share resources, opportunities, and other relevant information.\n\nAppendix\nRunning Hybrid Programs\nWe can think of the acceleration programs in two models: \nThose that run face-to-face, which allow entrepreneurs to meet in a physical space at the same time, and \nThose that are carried out regardless of physical barriers, the time zone, the thousands of kilometers of distance between people, or even complex situations (such as those we have been experiencing in the last years).\nVirtual accelerator programs are growing in popularity and have several advantages for founders and program teams. Virtual programs can also be delivered in a hybrid format, blending both online & offline elements. Virtual and Hybrid Accelerator programs allow\nImproved Flexibility\nOne of the main benefits of hybrid programs is improved flexibility, which is becoming extremely important within the sector. Generally speaking, entrepreneurs want as many options as possible, and the ability to move from in-person to remote can be invaluable. Access to recorded sessions offers a second chance at missed sessions, memory refreshers, and a deeper reflection of session discussions.\nWork with a more significant number of enterprises from much broader geographic areas.\nThe most exciting aspect of hybrid programs for many entrepreneurs is their potential to open up access to learning. On a basic level, when in-person is the only option available, all entrepreneurs need to be within traveling distance of the accelerator throughout the entire duration of their course. However, It is not necessarily the case with hybrid programs, which can mean more people can participate. This will expose the teams to meet people coming from diverse cultural backgrounds. In turn, this will lead to an increased cultural quotient and enhanced collective intelligence exercises. \nSupport your Accelerator community, even during lockdowns\nOne problem we’ve run into in the past is the limited pool of mentors available for any given in-person workshop. Virtual programming has freed us up to engage world-class mentors from anywhere, including mentors that bring enormous technical, business, and market knowledge and speak the language of the startups in our cohort – culturally and literally.\nLeveraging your workshop content to create a reusable library\nE-Learning is no longer a simple byproduct of the information age and Internet access. It’s become an invaluable resource to educators, harnessing a new knowledge-sharing model wherein learners now possess the tools to learn at their own pace. Some online tools allow for quickly creating tests/quizzes, templates, and other resources. Practical benefits include tracking digital assignments’ submissions and reusing or reconstructing a course curriculum using new course templates.\nKEY POINTS: \nHybrid programs allow program managers to work with:\nImproved Flexibility\nA more significant number of enterprises from much broader geographic areas\nSupporting your Accelerator community, even during lockdowns\nLeveraging your workshop content to create a reusable library\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nBloom Digital Library\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nWhat Have We Learned Running Our Acceleration Program Fully Online in the Past 5 Years?\n\nFacilitation for Amazing Online and Offline Experiences\nPeople learn through doing, practicing, and sharing. People also know best when they’re having fun! When they’re engaged and happy. \nCritical Aspects of Facilitation \nThe same care for organizing an offline event should go into managing an online event, whether as small as a meeting with a few people or as big as a major conference or demo day. \nThe medium is the message. A well-planned and well-facilitated event can have more engagement and impact than a poorly planned or facilitated event. \nCreate Bridges Between the Physical and the Virtual\nPlay games and pass items back and forth between screens \nShare tea, coffee, or a meal while on a call \nMake a gift box of friendly perks/treats/tools to help them in the accelerator, and things to do fun games/activities with: \nInspirational items (posters, notebooks, magnets, etc.)  \nShirts, hats, or something to wear \nClown noses or fun items (in wrapping that disguises what they are until use) \nTools for activities, such as printouts of frameworks, post-its, pens, activity cards, etc.\nStretching exercises, especially after having been at the laptop for more than half an hour.\nSharing music: In each session, let a participant choose the session’s background music\nWhiteboard: share the whiteboard before the session begins and ask each participant to share a motivational quote/message.\nSimple Tips for Increasing Engagement Online \nEye contact: Look at the camera (not the screen) when talking, especially when recording something \nThe background: Something nice? Art? Outdoors? Inspiring? A banner with logos? \nSound: Use a better mic if possible, definitely headphones. Make sure nothing is rubbing against the microphone or mic cable while talking. \nAppearance: Try to be as “close to in-person” as possible … What are you wearing? Try not to wear big headphones. \nStand up when talking (it changes body language and energy).\nMute yourself whenever you’re not speaking to avoid interrupting the speaker\nMake sure your Zoom name is adjusted and has your team/organization/role in it as well\n\n"

How can we integrate PERMAH and EntreComp into the regular program checkpoints (like monthly reviews and mentor sessions) without creating additional overhead or assessment fatigue?\n\n2. Given your program's focus on both organizational and personal development, how can we design progress tracking that naturally captures both dimensions through existing touchpoints like the grant disbursement process and demo days?\n\n3. How can we leverage the community aspect of your program (peer feedback, mentor relationships) to validate growth in both personal and organizational dimensions while maintaining our \"learning by doing\" philosophy?\n\nONE PAGE RECOMMENDATION:\nBloom should evolve its assessment approach from separate tracks (ECAT, EntreComp, PERMAH) into an integrated growth journey that maps to the program's natural rhythm and existing touchpoints. Here's how:\n\nPhase 1: Initial Mapping (During Bootcamp)\n- Combine initial assessments into one \"Growth Mapping\" session where teams:\n  * Complete ECAT for organizational baseline\n  * Identify key EntreComp competencies relevant to their goals\n  * Set wellbeing priorities through PERMAH\n  * Create an integrated development plan that includes both personal and organizational goals\n\nPhase 2: Evidence-Based Progress Tracking (During Accelerator)\n- Transform monthly check-ins to capture both dimensions:\n  * Link grant disbursement milestones to both organizational and personal growth evidence\n  * Have mentors validate both technical progress and leadership development\n  * Use peer feedback sessions to gather insights on both business progress and personal growth\n\nPhase 3: Validation Through Action\n- Redesign demo day preparation to showcase both organizational and personal growth:\n  * Include \"leadership journey\" segment in pitch presentations\n  * Create portfolio of evidence combining business metrics and personal development\n  * Have mentors validate growth across all dimensions\n\nImplementation Tools:\n1. Integrated Dashboard\n- Single view showing organizational health (ECAT) alongside personal growth metrics\n- Progress tracking tied to grant disbursement milestones\n- Evidence portfolio building automatically through program activities\n\n2. Mentor Engagement Structure\n- Clear framework for mentors to validate both technical and personal growth\n- Regular touchpoints aligned with program milestones\n- Standardized feedback format capturing both dimensions\n\n3. Community Validation Mechanism\n- Peer feedback system tied to specific competencies\n- Evidence validation through community engagement\n- Recognition system for both organizational and personal achievements\n\nThis approach would make assessment more natural and actionable while maintaining the program's focus on practical growth and community support.\n\nHALF PAGE RECOMMENDATION:\nIntegrate assessments into program flow through three key mechanisms:\n\n1.

            "text": " Let me first analyze the assessment structure and challenges, then provide recommendations in three formats.\n\n3 Key Questions to Guide Assessment Improvement:\n1. How can we integrate PERMAH and EntreComp into the regular program checkpoints (like monthly reviews and mentor sessions) without creating additional overhead or assessment fatigue?\n\n2. Given your program's focus on both organizational and personal development, how can we design progress tracking that naturally captures both dimensions through existing touchpoints like the grant disbursement process and demo days?\n\n3. How can we leverage the community aspect of your program (peer feedback, mentor relationships) to validate growth in both personal and organizational dimensions while maintaining our \"learning by doing\" philosophy?\n\nONE PAGE RECOMMENDATION:\nBloom should evolve its assessment approach from separate tracks (ECAT, EntreComp, PERMAH) into an integrated growth journey that maps to the program's natural rhythm and existing touchpoints. Here's how:\n\nPhase 1: Initial Mapping (During Bootcamp)\n- Combine initial assessments into one \"Growth Mapping\" session where teams:\n  * Complete ECAT for organizational baseline\n  * Identify key EntreComp competencies relevant to their goals\n  * Set wellbeing priorities through PERMAH\n  * Create an integrated development plan that includes both personal and organizational goals\n\nPhase 2: Evidence-Based Progress Tracking (During Accelerator)\n- Transform monthly check-ins to capture both dimensions:\n  * Link grant disbursement milestones to both organizational and personal growth evidence\n  * Have mentors validate both technical progress and leadership development\n  * Use peer feedback sessions to gather insights on both business progress and personal growth\n\nPhase 3: Validation Through Action\n- Redesign demo day preparation to showcase both organizational and personal growth:\n  * Include \"leadership journey\" segment in pitch presentations\n  * Create portfolio of evidence combining business metrics and personal development\n  * Have mentors validate growth across all dimensions\n\nImplementation Tools:\n1. Integrated Dashboard\n- Single view showing organizational health (ECAT) alongside personal growth metrics\n- Progress tracking tied to grant disbursement milestones\n- Evidence portfolio building automatically through program activities\n\n2. Mentor Engagement Structure\n- Clear framework for mentors to validate both technical and personal growth\n- Regular touchpoints aligned with program milestones\n- Standardized feedback format capturing both dimensions\n\n3. Community Validation Mechanism\n- Peer feedback system tied to specific competencies\n- Evidence validation through community engagement\n- Recognition system for both organizational and personal achievements\n\nThis approach would make assessment more natural and actionable while maintaining the program's focus on practical growth and community support.\n\nHALF PAGE RECOMMENDATION:\nIntegrate assessments into program flow through three key mechanisms:\n\n1. Unified Growth Planning\n- Combine ECAT, EntreComp, and PERMAH into single \"Growth Map\" during onboarding\n- Link personal development goals directly to organizational objectives\n- Create integrated milestones that demonstrate progress in both areas\n\n2. Evidence-Based Progress Tracking\n- Use grant disbursement process to validate both organizational and personal growth\n- Transform monthly check-ins into holistic progress reviews\n- Build portfolio of evidence through program activities\n\n3. Community-Powered Validation\n- Leverage peer feedback for both business and personal growth validation\n- Structure mentor engagement to cover both dimensions\n- Use demo day to showcase integrated progress\n\nImplementation through existing program touchpoints requires minimal additional overhead while providing more comprehensive growth tracking.\n\nPARAGRAPH WITH BULLET POINTS:\nTransform assessment from separate tracks into integrated growth journey by:\n• Combining initial assessments into single \"Growth Mapping\" exercise\n• Using grant milestones to validate both organizational and personal progress\n• Leveraging community feedback for holistic growth validation\n• Building evidence portfolio through existing program activities\n• Structuring demo day to showcase both business and leadership growth\n\nThis approach maintains program focus on practical learning while providing better tracking of all development dimensions.",
