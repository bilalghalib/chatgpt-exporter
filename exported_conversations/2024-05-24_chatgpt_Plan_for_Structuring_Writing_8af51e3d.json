They point at things that are valuable and needed for the moment they are named. Then they change and morph as they are applied (social-emotional learning/21st-century skills, etc) - we must find a way to create a system that allows input from youth and educators to evolve the framework. The framework must also not be linear, and rather than choose your own adventure, we can have graph based choices in a spot, like attempting to dig a hole somewhere in a field to plant a seed - which will develop roots of competencies, branches of skills and fruits of value the person creates at that location (Genius loci), that this is what we seek, the best place to grow. That this dynamic system is like the digital game of life, yet involves moving humans around a \"field\" and interacting and we want to create a self sustaining ecosystem that includes sustaining temporally, positionally, and with scale. you can find more in the writing. .. any other questions or do you want the content?

      "content": "yes, i like the example of the banyan tree, perhaps there's other trees more relevant like the mangrove or others that have roots that snake out till they find a good spot to root\nxy axis maps where we place concepts on a plane like \"important/urgent\" \nOkay, so let's think about categorizations, librarians, library studies, the effort of taming the world, which is truly alive, and the goal to feel safe being at odds with the truth of complexity and change and evolution and new.\n\nThis is the reality is.\n\nThis is not yesterday.\n\nNow is not the now that I just mentioned.\n\nThis is the now.\n\nThe word positive psychology might mean more than the -- might mean more than what you might think, right?\n\nbecause positive psychology has a definition that is evolving, that is adapting, that is changing every day, just like the flowers here are not the same kinds of flowers that were here the last time I was here.\n\nAnd they are, in a sense, the same as they were the year before.\n\nAnd maybe this is where it's not the same, but yes, the same comes in, because every part of the year and of the day is different, but it's not the same as yesterday, but it is the same in some sense, and that it rhymes with last year, right?\n\nLike it looks the same, but there's evolution, right?\n\nEverything does.\n\nEvery year, there is no category of tulip other than this year's category.\n\nWe can put a label on something for only as long as that thing will be the same, exactly the same.\n\nBut then things change because of evolutionary pressures, because of adaptation, because influence, right?\n\nThese dynamic systems of growth and decline in a population.\n\nSo for instance, a fox or a rabbit will be eaten by a fox, and so it won't reproduce.\n\nBut if it did reproduce, it would have had a certain sort of genetic material that it would have been able to pass on to the next generation.\n\nAnd because it didn't reproduce, the current state of rabbits, two or three or four generations down is missing, that new evolutionary adaptations that that rabbit might have offered.\n\nAnd so on, we can look at other sorts of creatures and other sets of systems where we might think that the rabbit is a part of the...\n\nYeah.\n\nSo these kinds of old and new and let's be much more specific about what we're talking about.\n\nSo, one of the things that we're looking at and that we can discuss is whether or not it's a category called 21st century skills.\n\nThat's one of the ways that we can talk about these things, or are these things not skills, but competencies.\n\nAnd what is a competence?\n\nCompetence means that you have a skill to a level where you can achieve a goal competently.\n\nAnd at least it's my interpretation.\n\nAnd so this category shifts and evolves, and then even becomes a meta idea to discuss, like, 21st century skills, or people use the acronyms all the time for SEL, social emotional learning.\n\nAnd somehow, social emotional learning and Harvard and their giant map makes you feel comfortable, makes you feel like, \"Oh, at least someone knows what they're doing.\n\nAt least someone knows what's going on.\"\n\nAnd we say that because Harvard has been cataloging all of the different qualities and traits that people have been kind of, like, intuiting or putting their finger on that is a thing that's of interest, right?\n\nSo when we look at social emotional learning, 21st century skills, or transformative education, or let's come up with a few other words for this thing.\n\nI don't remember them all right now.\n\nIt's an intuition that there's a gap -- it's a metaphor, 21st century skills, that's describing an intuition that there's a gap between the skills needed for the 21st century and the education provided.\n\nAnd it is making a claim that the people that derive these skills are able to -- derive this set of skills are able to appropriately sense into what the 21st century requires and to sense into what is required by -- or what young people need to have a good life, although it doesn't really say that.\n\nIt doesn't say that directly, but I think when people started thinking about this, it finally gave traction -- traction.\n\nThere's another analogy here to the idea that we can and probably should reconsider the purpose of 21st century skills and education.\n\nInitially coming from a question about utility and jobs and jobs creation, and then coming to the point of life satisfaction and realizing that there needs to be -- probably because 21st century skills have been around so long that they now include the people that would have needed to benefit from 21st century skills in their education.\n\nFor instance, the people that were around my age when they were -- or maybe even younger, maybe people in their mid-20s right now who are graduating from master's programs and applying to the UN and creating different frameworks with the EntreCom framework and the LifeCom framework.\n\nThey were thinking probably to themselves, like, oh, how I wish.\n\nTo think of it like a constellation and to work with so many different people to try to come up with a framework is very, very UN.\n\nI feel like maybe the UN has this incentive to attempt to make the world comprehensible and mapped and at least for now fixed, which I think is probably a difficult idea to swallow, that the world wants to be wild and needs to be wild and needs to be new.\n\nAnd so how do you create a framework that actually learns?\n\nAnd I think that's the question, is can we make a framework that asks itself why and derives its own framework, watching for outcomes, for complaints, and for the highest levels of meaning and deriving its own framework from there?\n\nI believe it could be possible.\n\nSo let's think about that a little bit as we look through first the Scriber framework and then how it connects to cognitive science principles and principles of -- yeah, I think I need to map this -- the principles of a framework that is connected to modern-day pedagogy.\n\nAnd what is that about?\n\nWhat is all of that about?\n\nI think modern-day pedagogy is my shorthand for a framework that attempts to take the intuition that previous education is not up for the task of our time.\n\nAnd instead of offering people the answers, giving people the reins of their own trajectory by telling them that you're here to learn how to learn.\n\nYou're here to be a part of the system that's creating itself.\n\nYou are a member of the system.\n\nAnd that's why a lot of the elements of including learners in the process of defining the pedagogy in the curriculum, that's going to show me which pedagogies are really a part of this thing.\n\nAnd so if we look at it, the truth of the situation that we find ourselves in is that the systems are changing, that these are -- the systems that we're all in are fluctuating.\n\nAnd we have at the highest metacognitive level of human organization that is an established structure is the UN.\n\nAnd the UN, of course, emerges after a period of pain and deconstruction of identity, a period of doubt and concern, a period where people are able to let go of their individuated senses of self and grow beyond to become something that sees the self as interdependent and connected to all of the rest of these structures, all the businesses, all the other countries.\n\nWe're all in it together.\n\nAnd when you think in this way, the UN can establish fundamental human rights.\n\nThe UN is then encouraged to identify and become more an organization that serves the larger idea of its global constituents.\n\nAnd until we extend to different planets and meet other entities, I mean, I guess one of the planets that we are inhabiting alongside others is the oceans and all the animals and the land.\n\nAnd we have not yet, and we are now, I think, witnessing the next phase of the development of something quite like the UN.\n\nAnd if you think about it, let's say that we offer animals the ability to speak and we hear the stories of the frogs that are now being genocided and exterminated by the millions.\n\nAnd we realize at some point that I am here because you are there.\n\nThis is like this because that is like that, that you are here with us on this planet and you deserve existence.\n\nAnd if we can get them to talk through data, it's one thing.\n\nBut if we can get individuals to talk and we are able to empathize because of storytelling, I think things become a little bit different.\n\nAnd we see the world anew.\n\nWe see that these frogs are just like us in some kind of ways.\n\nAnd because of that, I think we get to then start including them into the new charter of not fundamental human rights.\n\nIt's the rights of Gaia, rights of this new global organism that has constituents that are represented by animals as well as people.\n\nAnd we're not doing even the people justice yet.\n\nAnd so I believe, though, a generation from now, once the concept of including animals is becoming a part of things.\n\nAnd so this is, I think, one of the things to realize is 21st century skills open the door to bringing learners into the development and changes the trajectory of pedagogy being a master teacher to a teacher teacher or a student becoming the master, where it's actually younger people who are asked about their own desires, their own objectives, their own goals, and asking them, \"Is school doing it for you?\"\n\nAnd I think this is really important.\n\nAnd the thing that I've been trying to say is that we are a part of a world that is now not able to sustain itself by what got us here won't take us there.\n\nAnd we all know that as adults.\n\nAnd I think youth are beginning, not beginning, youth know that.\n\nAnd this is why they're terrified and why they are wanting more and more to be able to be a part of the direction.\n\nAnd this is why entrepreneurship and youth entrepreneurship is so critical is because youth are literally the future in that they are going to exist hopefully longer than most adults alive today.\n\nAnd also the future because they are going to be educated with these systems that take into consideration that the system itself is the thing that's needing both refinement, education, and creation.\n\nIt's creating itself.\n\nAnd so if a pedagogy includes young people and includes young people in its design and implementation, then it's actually becoming something new.\n\nAnd if educators can see this, if educators can see this, then they are a part of the co-creation of this new pedagogical system.\n\nAnd the system itself, I believe, will go from being something that teachers do to students that the system does for itself because the framework that we're going to use needs to be alive, not just the application of the framework.\n\nAnd this is going to be difficult for people to accept because when you have a map, it brings you peace.\n\nIf you see yourself on a map, you can say to yourself, \"Aha, I'm on this map and we're going to the destination.\"\n\nAnd that is something that is calming.\n\nYou can always, in any moment of uncertainty, tell yourself that you are here on the map.\n\nThe thing is, the reality is that the world is actually truly uncertain.\n\nThat it's actually, they say the map is not the territory, and that's very true.\n\nBut people need to understand that that actually means that they need to be informing and co-creating a new map.\n\nAnd this map is going to be a map that comes from the youth themselves.\n\nAnd a map that is...\n\nA map that comes from the youth and the adults and all the previous maps.\n\nA map that is...\n\nYeah.\n\nA map that derives from deeper first principles.\n\nAnd some of these first principles, I believe, are going to be coming from feelings of the learners and whether or not they feel like they're living a meaningful life.\n\nA life of purpose, a life of connection, a life of flourishing.\n\nAnd having that as the prime investigator, and then having the system design and optimize for that is something that we were not able to do before until Large Language Models.\n\nAnd so the thing is, we can start with a system that is not so clear about all of that.\n\nWe can start with a best guess effort for the compass.\n\nAnd so all of this work in defining frameworks is not for not.\n\nEven the inter-development goals.\n\nI think the inter-development goals can be seen as maybe the...\n\nAlong with flourishing and other theorists of a life well spent are going to be coming up with the optimization function that we're looking for.\n\nAnd even that, I'm hesitant to claim is going to be the only thing.\n\nBecause we also have local, global, and short-term and long-term impacts to consider from a human life.\n\nFor instance, let's say that someone, because of the uniqueness of their character, finds a lot of meaning and is stuck in what you could consider a local minimum.\n\nAnd a local minimum, to me, means that it's something that is meaningful to the person because they have not yet identified or explored an other thing that will give them a sense of meaning, greater, deeper, richer, more diverse than their first experiment.\n\nFor instance, let's say that somebody loves rock collecting.\n\nAnd they love identifying and collecting.\n\nAnd nothing is anything wrong with it.\n\nIt could be the ultimate thing for the person dependent on their capacity, competencies, knowledge, experience, expectations, ability to understand.\n\nJust the overall genius of the person in that moment expresses itself as rock collector.\n\nAnd it could be when that genius is being touched and explored, that that person is feeling excellent.\n\nThis is the thing for them.\n\nAnd then they go to watch a movie.\n\nAnd this movie shows to them a whole new world.\n\nIt shows them the frogs that they used to love as a child but have grown distant from.\n\nAnd they see that these frogs are suffering.\n\nThey see that these frogs are dying, that there's hundreds of thousands of frogs that are dying each year due to human behavior.\n\nAnd they feel moved to do something about it.\n\nThey are then suddenly, they become frog champions.\n\nAnd they need other people.\n\nAnd actually more of the Perma framework becomes alive in them.\n\nFor instance, they are now in R.\n\nThe letter R in the Perma framework is about relationships.\n\nBefore the rock collection was very solitary.\n\nAnd perhaps they only had positive emotion from the thrill of discovery and engagement and flow from being outside and identifying and growing their skills of identification.\n\nBut then the frog stuff came into their life.\n\nAnd suddenly they realized that they had this new thing.\n\nAnd so we cannot trust, reliably, the individual who is learning to know their entire path.\n\nThat is, I don't think, going to be possible.\n\nWe need to have a randomization function, which life usually gives.\n\nSo the more digital we do this, the more randomness we have to inject into the system.\n\nBecause you never know what is going to be the thing for the person.\n\nAnd so what I would suggest is we can start with a map for a person.\n\nAnd then we need to really acknowledge the other elements.\n\nThere is a temporal element.\n\nSome people are not able to see the long-term impact of their actions.\n\nSome people are not able to see that if they are, you know, \"I love rocks!\"\n\n\"I'm going to collect rocks and that's what I'm going to do with my life!\"\n\n\"Do what you love!\"\n\nIf that's what people think.\n\nWhat might happen is that they then go into becoming a person who is stuck in their life as an elderly person, not really realizing that they needed relationships.\n\nIf they did, the frog activism became a volunteer and an organization for the preservation of natural habitats.\n\nThey started going outside more and that made them a little bit more susceptible to relationships because others are there alongside them.\n\nAnd therefore their life actually connected with more meaning, more sense of flourishing because their permascore grew because maybe in the rock collecting, the permascore is positive emotion, engagement and flow, relationships, meaning and achievement, and health.\n\nSo I think in rock collecting, maybe there's a little bit less likelihood of health because who knows how often they're going to be going outside in natural environments.\n\nThey may be going to stores and buying rocks or not being as nature oriented with the preservation of the environment with the frogs.\n\nIt's quite likely that the person will spend a lot of time outdoors in nature and then they're also doing it with other people.\n\nThis organization might be connecting the person with someone that they might wind up marrying or becoming best friends with.\n\nThe person might then feel like they're a part of something that is beyond them, that goes into the next generation.\n\nAnd I feel like the thing that could be really interesting for people is what is that thing that you work for that extends beyond your generation?\n\nThe thing that you're working for that you will realize nothing about during the course of your life.\n\nAnd I feel like those are the types of things that often provide the most meaning because if at the end of your life you have not yet achieved a goal, you have not yet done the thing that made you say, \"I saved all the frogs.\"\n\nBut if you start with the acknowledgement of this is worthy of a life committed to something and that I may die before I get there and not only may I die, that it is likely that I will die before we achieve the frog preservation goals, then that person, whenever they go, will always be successful because they didn't mean their success to attain in their life.\n\nAnd also that means that they set their goals big enough.\n\nI feel like often if you set a goal that you can achieve in your human life, you do not know first of all what a human life is for and how to live it satisfactorily because once you achieve a goal, you look at it and you think to yourself, \"Now what?\"\n\nYou know, there's a million problems.\n\nThere's going to be a million and one and you will be racing until you die.\n\nAnd so the idea of becoming that person who is that person who cares, that person who is solving a problem, that person who is not so personally invested in how, he who has a strong enough why, is able to achieve any how, right?\n\nAnd I think that that insight by Nietzsche is able to do any how is so important because we don't even know what we need to do.\n\nWe need to learn to do so many things and so all of those things that we need to learn are hows and even as we go forward, more and more of those things to do are going to be done by machines, you know?\n\nHow often have you ground your own peanut butter?\n\nThat used to be a thing.\n\nIt used to take time.\n\nIt used to be a part of a human life.\n\nIf you wanted peanut butter, you had to grind it.\n\nAnd of course, now that we have machines, I don't think people look back and say, \"Oh, let's grind more of our peanut butter ourselves.\"\n\nI know it's great to have fresh stuff but at the same time, it's great to have the time and this kind of like, \"What is technology for?\"\n\nkind of question is going to come up because we actually see that so many of the things that people are going to be able to do are going to be needed to learn about like, \"What is the thing to do?\"\n\nAnd then, of course, learning how to do some stuff because there's actually a lot of new things that we need to figure out and a lot of stuff that can't be done by machines that need to be done by a genius.\n\nBasically, everything that is worth doing needs to be done by a genius and a genius is the person that combines their love for rock collecting, their love of frogs, the fact that their family comes from northern Iraq, from the Kurdish region or from a Native American background and they realize that there's this connection between how their ancestors would take care of nature and how the place that they're currently in needs to be taken care of nature and they have this kind of connection backward, connection forward temporally.\n\nAnd then, maybe even realizing that the stuff that you do anywhere matters everywhere, that you work locally for the global and that this is all possible when you live and work for a project that is beyond you, that you're able to humble yourself to.\n\nAnd I really started thinking about humility and how humility really is the core virtue because it is the virtue that makes possible the abstract thinking of seeing the one in the many and the many and the one.\n\nAnd this is why God says, I think, in so many places that nobody with an ounce of arrogance is going to enter heaven.\n\nAnd heaven is heaven-ing, I think.\n\nIt's heaven-ing while we're on earth and heaven, insha'Allah, when we get into the afterlife, guard women, because heaven on earth is not possible.\n\nUtopia is always a process of achieving a place that is better than the one that we have, a place where frogs don't die.\n\nAnd so if the truth is, the world as we know it will never wait for us.\n\nIt's not waiting for us.\n\nIt will never stay the same.\n\nWe are going to be struggling to always make a new map of skills that are needed.\n\nOh, now we need to adapt all of our 21st century skills because there's a new tool called Large Language Models.\n\nI don't believe that's the case.\n\nI think the case of 21st century skills needs to be shifted to a 21st century understanding.\n\nAnd that 21st century understanding started with the UN.\n\nIt started with realizing that we are united in not our nations.\n\nThat's the thing.\n\nIt's so interesting.\n\nI feel like we need to reconsider the name of the UN as well because the thing that they were pointing towards, they only had the analogies for back then, which is we are united nations.\n\nAnd this idea of nationality, what exactly is a nation?\n\nAnd the Cherokee nation, I think, is interesting to think about or like other nations that are not related to the nation state idea that is only 200 years old.\n\nAnd so if you look at that first instinct of the United Nations to say, hey, let's work together.\n\nIt took a moment of complete brokenness where everyone was devastated by the war and thinking to themselves, how do we make sure that this doesn't ever happen again?\n\nAnd we're so far away from that now that people, I think, are forgetting how bad it was, how it was so difficult.\n\nAnd it was like death and destruction was so common and we were so bound up.\n\nAnd the idea of people on the front lines of a war singing Christmas carols just shows that the local and the global were not in harmony.\n\nBut we have the ability to synchronize this a little bit better and to connect with our feelings.\n\nI mean, people were afraid there and it was a fear and a doubt that what they were doing mattered.\n\nI think there was a lot of people who didn't, you know, from the Axis and the Allies that didn't want to be a part of it.\n\nThey should have been able to leave.\n\nI think even in a period of conflict, we should allow mutual parties to say, I actually don't care.\n\nAnd I want to have nothing to do with this.\n\nAnd even inside of a nation, I think the concept that we need to be associating with for our new idea of the United Nations is the planet, is all of us, is the togetherness.\n\nHow is all of us here going to make all of us possible?\n\nAnd that relates to treating it like a system and treating, meaning like the sensor at the very edges of the system, which is the individual and particularly the individual learning and the learners and the growers and the young people, because these sensors are the ones that see their parents struggling financially, see the destruction of the ecology or see the war that's happening around them and the death.\n\nAnd they have a connection to their feelings and the pain.\n\nAnd we need to be giving them things to do that are going to distract them, just like, you know, for people in conflict zones, they need to get out and do something else.\n\nWe need to devise educational pedagogies that ensure that they are more likely to be anti-fragile and to be experiencing post-traumatic growth rather than post-traumatic stress.\n\nAnd it looks like the things that do that are related to the things that create a world of thriving.\n\nAnd so looking at this, I believe we will start to see some important things in terms of this model.\n\nSo let's start crafting this system dynamic.\n\nWe have a node in the middle, which is the learner.\n\nWe have a big circle encompassing that node, which is the system at large.\n\nIt's everything.\n\nIt contains in it a whole bunch of other people.\n\nIt contains in it the ability to support the individual.\n\nIt is the game of life.\n\nAnd then we have a fundamental principle of a goal.\n\nAnd a goal, once there's a goal, there is a motive for learning.\n\nAnd learning is the seeking out of information, the internalization through either memorization or embodiment or skill development or the adaptation and the rewiring of the human nervous system, both motor skills, mental skills, verbal skills, to hopefully achieve the goal better and more likely be able to achieve the goal.\n\nAnd so that shift actually stabilizes or destabilizes the fabric between the nodes.\n\nSo for instance, as one achieves and approaches a goal, you could say that there's a goal and that there is a goal to eat, to have safety, have shelter, have security.\n\nYou can see Maslow's hierarchy of needs being the-- OK.\n\nYeah, being the framework of the goals.\n\nAnd this framework of needs, I think, is creating a moment that pulls the different individual nodes towards the edges of-- or towards the-- towards new, towards their goals.\n\nSo there are goals that have gravity, that create a motive force that is learning.\n\nAnd then there's the individual that either approaches or is pushed from that goal.\n\nAnd along the way, that goal may change.\n\nAnd so in terms of the 21st century skills, some of those skills, they say, are leadership.\n\nThat would be a sub-goal to achieving a state.\n\nSo for instance, that skill, you might say, is required for the person that wants to organize people on a volunteer effort to preserve the forest because he cares about the frogs.\n\nOr she cares about the frogs.\n\nAnd that learning happens of leadership when they are able to perceive the need to develop that skill to achieve their meta skill.\n\nAnd that can be learned through Albert Bandura's ideas of social learning, where we actually see somebody else performing something or learn about somebody else who achieved a goal through leadership skills, like speaking, public speaking, through compelling arguments, through being able to set a goal, to make a plan, to aim high.\n\nAll of these different qualities and skills are needed for someone to be able to say, that's where we want to go.\n\nAnd we're going to be able to do it.\n\nAnd so when somebody has all of that capacity and somebody else sees somebody doing that, they can tell what they need to do.\n\nAnd if it's not complete, that leadership framework isn't complete.\n\nSo you can have a framework.\n\nIt can be derived from an individual's life.\n\nIt can be derived from people that study and understand leadership.\n\nBut let's say that there's a new type of leadership that's needed.\n\nSomething like Lulu might say that it's servant leadership.\n\nOr the leaders at the bottom, for instance, is a new kind of framing that is different than leadership used to be thought of and considered in the past.\n\nAnd the reason that's changing is for many different reasons, but that needs to become visible so that the system can, in the future, give new stories to the next generation.\n\nSo for instance, this generation is decentralizing leadership and flipping the leadership pyramid.\n\nAnd I actually, as someone living through and attempting to live a process where I attempted to have consensus-based distributed leadership, I felt that it was still problematic, at least in my local situation.\n\nSo the difference in local versus the global is one of the ways that our frameworks fail.\n\nSo for instance, in Basra, Iraq, having a decentralized leadership situation was not appropriate for the culture.\n\nThe culture may shift, it may change.\n\nBut for the goal of creating a community space, the goal was not to shift the culture.\n\nThe goal that Nodas had was to shift the narrative on creativity and on making and finding his people and nerding out with them.\n\nAnd maybe his goal in the end is furthermore, at some point, once he started connecting with an international community instead of seeing some others living in a new way and being more open, you might say that it's less, it's now becoming more about culture shift.\n\nBut initially, his goal was to share community space and to nerd out and to explore something with people.\n\nAnd that was also my goal.\n\nAlthough I had assumed that by social learning from Noisebridge and from others that I learned from during the Two Hands Project tour that in Michigan, people would appreciate some of the things that I found most inspiring in California.\n\nSo for instance, consensus-based leadership.\n\nAnd the thing is, in both of these places, both in Basra, where Nodas was starting his science camp, and in All Hands Active, where I was working on my hackerspace with my co-founders, All Hands Active was not appropriate.\n\nIt was actually a type of leadership that required a more traditional, hierarchical, structured approach.\n\nAnd I was not able to personally, at that age, identify my true goal and therefore be able to humbly submit and suggest that, okay, my leadership style that I need to learn, I needed to learn a leadership style.\n\nI learned a leadership style in those days, back in 2008, from Noisebridge.\n\nI believe that that approach was helpful in those days for me to be inspired and to have the motivation.\n\nAnd it's really important about that time and that leadership style is not that it was wrong for me to attempt to bring that in, but because if it wasn't for being inspired, self-leadership is a core component of leadership.\n\nAnd if you can't keep yourself motivated, so motivation, I think, is probably a long-sighted meaning, one of the really important factors.\n\nAnd it might be the diversifying factor.\n\nIt might be the thing that helps us see a framework modification that is needed, even if it means that we have to be proven wrong and then kind of allow ourselves to find new ways to stay motivated, but to let go of our initial kind of motivating features.\n\nSo for instance, for me, my motivation was very high to be able to bring consensus-based decision-making into all hands active in an arbor.\n\nAnd my motivation for Nodas was also how cool would it be if there was a community space in Iraq that was taking on some of the new theoretical leadership principles from modern practices from San Francisco and Berlin and not what's there in Basra, Iraq.\n\nWho would have seen it?\n\nAnd I think a part of that was ego.\n\nAnd that's why humility is the fundamental virtue.\n\nAnd again, you can see it over here.\n\nThere was not a lot of humility in the way that I was thinking in those days.\n\nIt was more like, it would be cool if I brought this idea and people started behaving in this new and creative way.\n\nThere's also belief that it was more interesting, more beautiful, more true, more good to have decentralized.\n\nIt was like an automatic idea.\n\nIt was like, open is good.\n\nOpen source, open space, open free, Libra, open source culture.\n\nAnd I realized that that was not only always true.\n\nOpen is not always good.\n\nThat there are some places that need to be closed, that need to be membership driven, that need to be more designed and crafted and hosted by a leader who welcomes people.\n\nAnd that made sense in Iraq and no one else was that person.\n\nAnd because of that, the place was able to flourish.\n\nAnd because I had co-founders in my organization in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who were like, \"Vidal, we love you, but we're not going to let you ruin the possibility of having a space like this just because you think it should be consensus.\"\n\nWe believe that in Michigan, it's not Silicon Valley.\n\nThere's reasons why this is not going to work here.\n\nWe love the idea too, but in order for us to be able to pay rent, we need to have a member model where people actually do that.\n\nAnd so the goal of the leadership of designing an organization that would fit its space should have been my highest level goal, but it wasn't.\n\nAnd so for that reason, I was not able to continue being the leader of the space.\n\nI needed to let others take over.\n\nAnd the good thing is my approach of being a backstage leader, of being one of many, meant that we had the diversity of opinions.\n\nAnd I wonder if that's an important meta thing to learn, is that you have to learn collectively, both with your own region and then also with others.\n\nBecause when an idea comes, there needs to be something that is solid there that can then be enhanced with something else.\n\nSo there's already enough new genetic drifts coming into a location through the idea of the hyperspace.\n\nThere did not need at the same time to be the genetic drift of the open culture and the leader fluidity, or not even leader fluidity.\n\nIn those days, it was consensus-based leadership.\n\nThe thing that I derived later, and it took me a long time to understand, was that it's really important to me, not that I have this idea of leadership, but that I have leader fluidity.\n\nAnd I think that leader fluidity, like leader fluid, meaning that I will step up.\n\nThere needs to be leadership.\n\nSomeone needs to be able to direct.\n\nAnd then there needs to be ways for other people to direct.\n\nAnd so that person needs to step down.\n\nThat idea took me some time to develop.\n\nAnd I think that time, both in the sense of the system needing to be able to consider local effects in time and space, and distance effects in time and space, and then scale effects in time and space.\n\nAnd if we can consider all of these things as the system is trying to optimize both for local meaning and motivation, as well as global meaning and motivation-- and I feel like meaning is enough.\n\nYou know how there's that paper that goes like, attention is all you need?\n\nI'm not 100% convinced yet, but I believe if we look into it, meaning might be all you need.\n\nMeaning being the meta-principle that we are optimizing for locally and globally.\n\nAnd if people are able to have a sense of meaning alongside their fundamental needs and the resources-- and so in this map of a game of life, we need to have a simplified drawing of what we're working with.\n\nWe have individual people who are a part of families and societies and communities.\n\nAnd these individual people have different levels of mental abstraction, and they either see themselves as their communities and take on their communities' expectations of them and have those be a big part of their motivation.\n\nBut as one develops, you actually grow out of that if you actually continue to proceed along the path of mental complexity and adult development and actually gaining perspective on what you used to associate with.\n\nSo if you are an individual in a system that is seeing itself as the system, you may consider that the individual is the family until they see themselves as distinct.\n\nAnd then if the individual sees themselves and their family as a part of their community, then you could see that note as the entire community, as the self, and so on and so forth, expanding ever outward until the system recognizes the individual as the system.\n\nAnd in that space, the decision making requires more information because the individual wants to know what happens when I buy this tomato to climate change, to the destruction of the environment.\n\nWhat happens when I say these words, and how does it impact the other person?\n\nAnd what happens if I publish this thing on the internet?\n\nWhat happens to the whole landscape of the intellectual community?\n\nWhat is the broadest impact of how I am living?\n\nBecause I am also interdependent to all these other things.\n\nBut initially, the young people that we are working with, they are going to not be seeing the world in that way.\n\nThey are going to be self-identified with themselves, and maybe their small tribe, maybe their family.\n\nAnd so what we need to do is develop curriculum that help them see themselves as the system.\n\nAnd until that, this is an important point, double underline and highlight, until the individual sees themselves as the system.\n\nThe system has to see themselves as the system for them and support them in creating the architecture of learning around them to both help them grow, but also to help them think both temporally and distance, with distance, time and space, and scale of the impact of their actions.\n\nIf everyone did that, what would happen?\n\nWhat happens to something far away?\n\nWhat happens if you do this for the rest of your life and you smoke?\n\nWhat happens?\n\nAnd to be able to present that information by storytelling from others, social learning, showing people at the end of their life dying of cancer, showing what happens with an explorable sort of animated JavaScript view of a world where everyone lived like an American.\n\nHow much CO2 would be emitted?\n\nHow much would that trap heat in the atmosphere?\n\nWhat would happen then?\n\nAnd so knowledge, they say, is power because knowledge inspires feeling.\n\nLike when you see something and you are learning to keep an open heart along with an open mind, I believe that what happens is you will want to do.\n\nYou might not know what to do.\n\nAnd the problem, one of the interesting measures that the Large Language Model could be searching for is stuckness or loops, repeating behaviors where people may obsessively be binge watching YouTube even about their topic but not acting or not doing, thinking that a new piece of information is going to give them the clue to tell them how to behave.\n\nBut seeing and then letting it impact how you feel and then doing something about it is kind of the core of this thing.\n\nAnd so the system has many frameworks because when you are going to learn, let's say you decide that you wanted to work on reforestation and land preservation for preserving the habitat of frogs.\n\nAmazing.\n\nAnd not only did you need to learn leadership to gather people but you actually need to learn aforestation techniques for swaths of land close to you and then you are going to have to learn some publishing techniques because you realize that we need to find ways of helping others see this and duplicate it and how do I do that best?\n\nWell, I need to document well.\n\nSo I want to take good pictures.\n\nIt is something that I love to do as well and I want to make this a way that other people can realize that they can too preserve the environment around them.\n\nThis is my volunteer project.\n\nI have another project that I do to satisfy my economic needs and this is what I do on the weekends.\n\nBut I want to make sure that when I am doing it I am creating scaffolding for the future.\n\nAnd so we have motivation.\n\nI am needing to make sure that people are able to see their goal, to feel the desire of learning and that desire, that propulsive force, I would say is motivation for learning.\n\nAnd so that motivation for learning can be damaged, can be influenced, can be increased or decreased by life experience.\n\nAnd some of it is related to external and some of it is related to internal factors including encouragement and including support, financial and otherwise.\n\nAnd recognition from their peers.\n\nAnd different people are going to have different needs because there is difference in the world.\n\nBut creating a framework where there is kind of a meta framework that we are trying to maximize for the individual meaning and we don't actually know that connection.\n\nMeaning I believe often comes from a lived value.\n\nAnd meaning I feel also touches self-knowledge like answering the question why am I here needs to answer a few questions.\n\nWho is I and what is here and why are you there and what are you supposed to do about it?\n\nSo for instance self-knowledge of the I might entail realizing that for whatever reason you can call it an accident of the universe, this consciousness appeared in a location in Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nThe other thing that you might recognize is very early many parents and many children.\n\nYou might say it's a forgotten conclusion.\n\nYou do not have the ability to design the traumas that were inflicted upon you as a child that shape you into who you are.\n\nNot just the traumas but also the experiences.\n\nFor a large part of your early life others and the environment is determining your developmental trajectory.\n\nIf we had the system in place that is doing the learning of the like helping construct the scaffolding around the learner to help them see themselves not immediately consciously but to understand what happens to individuals that are most meaningful for them both on a local level, a temporal, local and distance, near and far in terms of time and small and big in terms of scale that helps them optimize meaning for the entirety of their duration of their life and meaning after death and I think that early in life it's going to be very difficult to find that thing that you might say I'm willing to commit my life towards this and it's going to require true diversity and this is why I think recognizing dips in motivation as a signal rather than a problem is really important and it's really important also to help people preserve here because there are local minima in motivation but if it drops for too long and too hard that dip in motivation might mean that that person's genius is being miscalculated and so we can identify genius, we can try to move people towards the current genius that needs to be manifested now in response to an expected future in time and space that is optimizing for meaning and possibility for the whole if that makes sense and so let's think about this and try to explain it a little bit more so there are a couple of key words there's the word genius and that means the things that make you who you are the things that you find interesting the things that you find naturally compelling the fact of where in the world you were born your initially your capacity for learning your capacity for memorizing your capacities that you might call fixed even though nothing seems to be truly fixed even intelligence can seem to grow with practice and so your genius is ever evolving alongside you and there's the thing that I think is underneath all of this which you may call your spirit your soul yourself the thing that is expressing and wanting to express itself and that you could say is you're trying to figure out what that is and the clues are coming through the places you've already found your genius where you're like ah hell yeah I love speaking you know some people like oh my god I'm beatboxing pro and I just started trying it and this thing that comes most naturally to you is going to feel awesome to do you're going to get recognition which is really important when people are young you're going to get a claim and it's likely that you're going to be able to offer something novel something valuable to others when you follow the things that want to emerge from you naturally and if we think about like a system that is you know even if you say genetically speaking random possibilities are being created where someone is going to be born with a natural inclination to be an incredible beatboxer they can make any sound with their mouth what is that going to mean well maybe they're going to be the one of the three individuals in the world who are going to be able to develop some super capacities let's say there are six-fingered people that are born who can play certain pieces on the piano that nobody else can play possibly can play the complexity of it that's going to be more likely to be their zone of genius they don't have to choose it it might not be motivating it might be that there's something else for them to explore that is more motivating but how is it possible that we can say what that is for them we may as an external organization the thing making the large language model that is analyzing this entire situation and trying to optimize for meaning and genius or genius through meaning and when you do that for an individual to optimize genius through meaning for local time and space and distance time and space and a little bit and a lot of it in terms of scale so for instance let's say that you beatbox only on the weekends or let's say that you beatbox every single day let's say that you beatbox for eight hours a day to improve your skills because that's how you become the person that takes that threat of genius and fans the flame on the embers just so that they become one of those three and is are you supposed to be one of those three only you can answer that question but there needs to be a recognition of the importance of the forces at play and then all of this needs to be held super loosely because I think true diversity cannot be crafted and requires an intersection with the real world and requires the beauty of the story that happens when somebody meets the mentor the hero's journey right so there is no hero's journey in a world crafted by a large language model there is no uncertainty in oh if I do this then that there's there's probabilities there's going to become perverse incentives to look at your six fingers and to look at the model that suggests like have you considered piano and to say screw you you're not going to tell me what to do and just like gattaca the importance of somebody who was genetically inferior and not destined to live a life amongst the stars in this movie gattaca this person had so much motivation so much determination and so much will that he was able to switch with somebody who had the genius in terms of the physical and mental capacities of at birth for this extremely grueling activity that requires somebody to be super fit physically and mentally then he got into an accident and so this other person who did not have those things comes into the story and just compensates for it all with extreme persistence motivation grit and growth and I feel like this story is going to become super important if we're building a system like this although at the same time I think it can offer very loosely your personal rubric and framework it could say seems like you need to learn some leadership skills the skills that I think seem that suited for you right now are this and this you can ask me why I believe that and you could tweak actually any of the variables inside of me and their strengths so for instance you open up the behind the scenes and it says that the goal that it has determined based on its conversation with you over time is that you want to help the frogs because it's super meaningful for you to talk to you about the things that touch your heart and then you can look at this and be like yeah that's a great story but it's actually you know the thing that I think is the most meaningful for me is to be there for my dad and actually I want to join the family business because it would mean that I'm a part of this legacy and supporting my father is more important to me right now than you know supporting the frogs and what I could do is you know make money and donate to charity and I can do both and it would update the model and then the model would say okay so what are like what is the job that you're thinking about doing with your father's business and it could then update all of the the single page sort of digest of the system of the node of that person and the propulsive force of motivation the guess that it had for it and the why that it had for that is going to have to be updated again and then they need to then pick a new set of frameworks and so let's say that once they do that the framework that is designed for them that they need to be exploring is going to be computer science because the business wasn't digitized and it needs to be like go through some kind of digital transformation and they're beginning to learn about algorithms and it turns out that you know they actually don't need to learn algorithms it's probably better for them to learn something like no code solutions and because there are stories of others who are in a similar position that have been able to do that and be able to write about it online the system could then say listen you know we did this analysis we shifted from leadership for starting like a nonprofit about frogs to a project where you're actually supporting your father in their digital transformation part of their business and you're studying learning computer science because that's the first thing you thought but there are these people who have been able to do this with that and it looks like if your goal is actually to do the digital transformation and support your dad this might be an easier approach than learning computer science unless you find that computer science is a zone of genius and da da da da da da da and so the person could then say yes computer science is actually something I've always wanted to learn and I'm taking the opportunity to do this I may even learn computer science skills and learn these algorithms because it actually scratches an itch of my curiosity and desire but then I will just wind up building a no code solution so this is the entire system that I am conceiving of right now that is trying to take it's like you walk through it's a graph based framework where new nodes are possible and you actually follow the path of a graph with all of our framework elements in it rather than and you follow that path so let's say your starting point is you and all of your skills right over here and instead of like a pac-man where you follow one after the other and you get badges representing skills each little ball could represent a circle that represents a badge and you start from one side and there's a linear progression and there's like another goal at the weight and what it could be is that you're this little pac-man but you're going down through a tree of fractal exploring many different skills and the initial suggestion is that you go from here to that next skill and then each node in that graph has to update itself with all of the possible next nodes and it does that by assessing it's representation for each potential node and each potential next learning area so for instance your graph might be okay so I'm going to learn enterprise capacities and as broadly like maps as it is in the EntreCom framework it looks like all of these skills are necessary for being an entrepreneur and you move from your initial state to the node where you're studying EntreCom and you talk with it a little bit and then it will assess all of your skills around EntreCom and make it best guess based on everything that is spoken to you about up until this point and so each of the next nodes is going to be a combination of two numbers one is how low do you score on this number is likely that if you want to be an entrepreneur and you have no ability to speak publicly it could be that you could do without it you could hire somebody it could be that you really need it two is it's guess about your motivation for learning that thing and then three is your feedback about which one of these things do you think is going to be the most important for you based on your expectations of the next steps that you're going to have to take and so this learning by doing system is a way of you going finding your weak areas and your strong areas and reviewing them all and kind of tweaking these variables for all of the different elements or like you know one could be you could give a star for one being what you think your zone of genius is going to be or you want it to be or is likely to be based on your capacities and your historic knowledge about yourself so for instance you're going and you step into this node and it's on for comp and you think to yourself like oh hell yeah speaking I got that put zone of genius on that that's going to make it something that either is going to encourage and encourage you to double down on because you're so strong or it's going to either discourage it and encourage you to do other things because you don't need it and maybe you need to do something that you're really weak at to shore it up enough so that you know how to hire somebody because you have the basic skills in public speaking to assess public speaking competency before bringing somebody on board and so this graph based learning approach where you also have the ability to modify the framework you can add a new node you say of all these things I don't think it's this is actually hitting the spot either let's go explore another framework another assessment or let's modify this assessment because I need to have an element for leadership that's about flipping the roles that's about consensus that's about distributed leadership and I don't see that in the framework and I'd like to learn about this and then it could go off into a different direction and I think that this sort of approach of the individual kind of in three dimensions you have a graph that extends down which kind of symbolizes the roots and then the top part is the experience which symbolizes the plant growing the individual being the seed the seed being in clusters with others as communities of families of organizations of businesses and the ability to produce fruit and to eat from each other's like fruits both of the value that they create of based on the learning that is deep within the soil underneath them and they're not fixed in space they're sort of like algae or something where the fruit can actually be moved they can actually move around in the world and maybe what it's about is the roots kind of extending really really deep and then actually having another part of you pop up somewhere else that is offering fruit in a new space in a new place for a new time and having your old self be there and actually be represented but it's sort of like the root of a banyan tree where it comes down and it digs into the earth but then you know as the root kind of snakes around on the ground and it finds another zone of genius for you you actually plant yourself there and you may be able to do that two or three who knows a couple of times in your life where you are then being able to shine someplace bear fruit and it's really important to allow that searching in the horizontal plane for the place where your genius wants to then manifest itself in terms of context and that context could be many things right it could be a digital environment where you want to work on you know storytelling for the courage people to get people to be able to see and experience and understand and learn and love and share a people that are underrepresented and it doesn't have to be in a physical space it could be a physical space where you want to preserve the land around your house for the frogs that you love and it could be in a emotional and relational space where you want to preserve the relationship and the legacy of your family and father by preserving the business that they started so many years ago and so all of these things could be projects and each project should be a place where you are exploring your zone of genius by developing skills and bearing fruit and if we do that for individuals and we actually support them in that navigation and we support them in thinking about all of these things I feel like this could be a very interesting new sort of framework for learning that is about cultivating a knowledge garden and helping people bloom and yeah if you can help me draw some of the graphs that are described in this and represent some of the ideas that I did in here in a way that is useful to share perhaps a banyan tree or something like that root that stretches across the ground until it finds its location and then grows down and grows up I believe that it would be very helpful thank you very much and yeah this is my talk.",

      "content": "Let's continue to add concepts and axes based on this content:\nSo I've been working on building a framework of prompting techniques that leverages how AI works and I realized that there's transfer learning that I think can happen between the way that a machine learns from inference and from how embeddings work and clustering concepts and how a human can cluster concepts as well.\n\nChatGPT\nBuilding a Framework for Prompting Techniques: Leveraging AI and Human Concept Clustering\nJosephine (White Hat) - Objective Facts and Information\n\nTransfer learning in AI involves taking a pre-trained model and applying it to a different but related task. This allows the model to leverage previously acquired knowledge and improve performance on new tasks. Inference, embeddings, and clustering are key components in this process:\n\nInference: The model makes predictions based on the input data.\nEmbeddings: These are vector representations of data points, capturing semantic relationships.\nClustering: This groups similar data points together, making it easier to identify patterns and relationships.\nClaude (Green Hat) - Creative Thinking and New Ideas\n\nLet's explore innovative ways to integrate AI techniques into human learning:\n\nInteractive Learning Tools: Develop tools that allow users to visualize embeddings and clusters, making abstract concepts more tangible.\nCross-Disciplinary Applications: Apply these AI techniques to various fields like language learning, history, and even art, to discover new patterns and connections.\nGamification: Create educational games that use AI-driven clustering to adapt to a learner’s style, providing personalized challenges and rewards.\nPrunella (Black Hat) - Identifying Potential Problems and Risks\n\nSeveral risks and challenges need to be addressed:\n\nOver-reliance on AI: There's a risk that learners might become too dependent on AI tools, hindering their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\nData Privacy: Using AI often involves large datasets, which can pose privacy concerns if not handled properly.\nBias in AI: AI models can perpetuate existing biases present in the training data, leading to skewed learning outcomes.\nPercy (Yellow Hat) - Highlighting Positive Aspects and Opportunities\n\nDespite the risks, there are numerous opportunities:\n\nEnhanced Learning Experiences: AI can provide personalized feedback and adapt to individual learning styles, improving engagement and retention.\nBroader Accessibility: AI-powered tools can make learning more accessible to people with different needs, including those with disabilities.\nNew Insights: By clustering concepts, AI can reveal previously unnoticed relationships, enriching the learning process.\nCyril (Red Hat) - Intuition, Emotions, and Gut Feelings\n\nFrom an intuitive standpoint, integrating AI in learning feels promising. The potential to uncover deep, meaningful connections between concepts is exciting. This approach could transform the way people learn and interact with information, fostering a deeper, more intuitive understanding of complex topics.\n\nQuackers (Blue Hat) - Synthesizing All Perspectives and Developing a Comprehensive Plan\n\nTo create a robust framework for prompting techniques that leverages AI and human concept clustering, we propose the following steps:\n\nResearch and Development: Conduct thorough research on existing AI techniques and how they can be adapted for human learning.\nTool Creation: Develop interactive tools that allow users to visualize and manipulate embeddings and clusters.\nPilot Programs: Implement pilot programs in educational settings to test and refine these tools.\nFeedback and Iteration: Gather feedback from users to continuously improve the tools and techniques.\nEthical Considerations: Establish guidelines to address privacy concerns and mitigate biases in AI.\nBy integrating AI-driven techniques with human learning processes, we can create a dynamic, personalized, and engaging educational experience. This approach not only leverages the strengths of AI but also empowers learners to explore and understand complex concepts in a more intuitive and meaningful way.\nCan you think with me about why the machine learning is similar to human learning and why that might help create some sort of resonance and transfer simplicity? I have this kind of intuition that sort of like moving with something and using its momentum to help propel it forward and adding to its momentum we can use the momentum of the learning of the machines to help the momentum of learning of the human and I think it has something to do with the fact that it's about concept clustering and metacognition and where you see the one in the many and the many in the one and how that is really similar to how some of the elements the machine learning processes take. Can you help explain the machine learning processes that make this many one relationship and one many and then help me understand how it could be related to learning?\n\nChatGPT\nExploring the Similarities Between Machine Learning and Human Learning\nJosephine (White Hat) - Objective Facts and Information\n\nMachine Learning Processes:\n\nConcept Clustering:\n\nClustering: In machine learning, clustering algorithms group similar data points together. For example, K-means clustering partitions data into clusters based on feature similarity.\nEmbeddings: These are dense vector representations of data that capture semantic meanings. For example, word embeddings like Word2Vec map words into a continuous vector space where similar words are closer together.\nInference:\n\nSupervised Learning: Here, the model learns from labeled data to make predictions. For example, in a classification task, the model infers the label of new data based on learned patterns.\nUnsupervised Learning: This involves finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data without labeled responses. Clustering is a common unsupervised learning task.\nTransfer Learning:\n\nTransfer learning involves leveraging a pre-trained model on a new, but related, task. This is akin to a student applying previously learned concepts to new problems.\nClaude (Green Hat) - Creative Thinking and New Ideas\n\nHuman Learning Processes:\n\nConcept Clustering in Human Learning:\n\nSchema Theory: Humans naturally cluster related concepts into schemas, which are cognitive frameworks that help organize and interpret information. For example, when learning about animals, a person might group them into categories like mammals, birds, and reptiles.\nConcept Mapping: This is a visual representation of the relationships between concepts. It helps learners see the connections and understand the broader picture.\nMetacognition:\n\nSelf-Reflection: Humans engage in metacognition by reflecting on their own thinking processes, which helps them understand and control their learning. This is similar to a model adjusting its parameters based on feedback to improve performance.\nLearning Transfer:\n\nApplying Knowledge: Like transfer learning in AI, humans apply knowledge from one context to another. For example, skills learned in mathematics can be applied to solve physics problems.\nPrunella (Black Hat) - Identifying Potential Problems and Risks\n\nChallenges and Risks:\n\nComplexity of Human Cognition:\n\nWhile AI can mimic certain aspects of human learning, human cognition is far more complex and involves emotions, intuition, and social interactions, which are challenging to replicate in machines.\nOver-Simplification:\n\nRelying too much on AI analogies might oversimplify human learning processes, potentially neglecting the nuances of how people learn and understand concepts.\nPercy (Yellow Hat) - Highlighting Positive Aspects and Opportunities\n\nResonance and Transfer Simplicity:\n\nEnhanced Learning through Visualization:\n\nVisualizing embeddings and clusters can help learners see the \"many in one\" and \"one in many,\" making abstract concepts more tangible and easier to understand.\nPersonalized Learning Paths:\n\nAI can provide personalized recommendations based on a learner's progress, similar to how transfer learning fine-tunes models for specific tasks, thus propelling the learner forward using the \"momentum\" of their learning.\nMetacognitive Skills:\n\nBy interacting with AI-driven tools, learners can develop better metacognitive skills, as they reflect on how they categorize and relate different concepts.\nCyril (Red Hat) - Intuition, Emotions, and Gut Feelings\n\nIntuitive Connections:\n\nSeeing Patterns:\nIntuitively, people understand that recognizing patterns and relationships is a key part of learning. AI clustering and embeddings resonate with this natural human inclination.\nMomentum in Learning:\nThere is a natural synergy in using AI's momentum—its ability to process and cluster vast amounts of information quickly—to aid human learning, creating a dynamic and engaging learning experience.\nQuackers (Blue Hat) - Synthesizing All Perspectives and Developing a Comprehensive Plan\n\nComprehensive Plan:\n\nIntegrate Visualization Tools:\n\nDevelop interactive tools that allow learners to visualize concept clusters and embeddings, making abstract relationships more concrete.\nPromote Metacognition:\n\nEncourage learners to engage in self-reflection and metacognitive practices, using AI tools to track their learning processes and provide insights.\nLeverage Transfer Learning:\n\nApply AI's transfer learning techniques to help learners apply previously acquired knowledge to new contexts, reinforcing their understanding and skills.\nEnsure Ethical Use:\n\nAddress ethical concerns by ensuring data privacy, mitigating biases in AI models, and promoting a balanced approach that values human intuition and creativity alongside AI capabilities.\nBy understanding and leveraging the similarities between machine learning and human learning, we can create a more effective and resonant educational framework that enhances the learning experience and propels both human and machine learning forward.\nI also have some ideas that machine learning and the process of humans building technology like we try to make life easier and it doesn't answer the question of what life is for like if you had the easiest life possible how will you understand the purpose and it doesn't relate you can have a job and everyone that is kind of working on making money will probably likely want to automate and simplify this process because the goal is the money and so if we can understand deeper goals beyond the money it would be likely things like I want to have a sustainable life where I can pursue discovering my sources of meaning and that in today's age we need money to do that because money is how we create a structure that allocates resources efficiently and there are less efficient ways of allocating resources for instance you know having a priest priestly class and then using incorrect and non true ideas to potentially sustain a stratified society so that certain individuals are able to pursue meaning and others are not or maybe that it's the priestly classes pursuing meaning on behalf of and supporting the meaning-seeking for everyone else and we have reached a point though where it seems like we've been reducing our stressors by softening life by using technology technology is augmenting human capacity and when it goes beyond our ability to see the boundaries of and we can even tell the true impacts of what we're doing because we're so highly leveraged you know it's a lever that levers a lever that levers a levers lever and then suddenly we're moving the world and we're a tiny flake on this world that we don't even know the impacts that we're having then you can never really know your ethics and our ability to see and perceive is related to our ability to have feelings and our ability to have feelings is our ability to have a sense of meaning and our ability to have a sense of meaning is the point and if we can find ways of supporting ourselves then maybe we can find ways of finding meaning in another way and there's 30% unemployment in the world is changing and you know I can hypothesize and theorize about why these things are interesting to do anyway but we are also facing a world that is in a crisis of meaning and so I'm looking for ways to connect all of this and it just sounds so crazy I'm really wondering if there's something to what I'm saying or if I'm just going mad\n\nChatGPT\nConnecting Technology, Human Purpose, and the Crisis of Meaning\nJosephine (White Hat) - Objective Facts and Information\n\nTechnological Impact on Life:\n\nAutomation and Efficiency: Technology aims to make tasks easier and more efficient, often by automating processes. This is driven by the desire to save time, reduce labor, and increase productivity.\nEconomic Structure: Modern economies rely heavily on money as a means to allocate resources efficiently. This system is more flexible and scalable compared to older methods, like barter or caste-based systems.\nUnemployment and Automation: The rise of automation has led to significant changes in the job market, including increased unemployment in certain sectors as machines replace human labor.\nClaude (Green Hat) - Creative Thinking and New Ideas\n\nExploring Deeper Goals and Meaning:\n\nRedefining Purpose Beyond Money: Society can shift its focus from purely economic goals to deeper, more fulfilling pursuits. This includes sustainable living, personal growth, and community well-being.\nSupporting Meaning-Seeking: Technologies can be developed to help individuals discover and pursue their sources of meaning. For example, AI-driven platforms can recommend activities, resources, and communities based on personal interests and values.\nEthical AI and Technology: We can design technology to be transparent and ethical, ensuring it supports human well-being and preserves our ability to feel and find meaning.\nPrunella (Black Hat) - Identifying Potential Problems and Risks\n\nChallenges and Risks:\n\nOver-Reliance on Technology: Excessive reliance on technology can disconnect individuals from the processes that give life meaning. Automation might make life easier but can also lead to a sense of purposelessness.\nEthical Blind Spots: The complexity of modern technology can obscure its true impacts, leading to unintended consequences that are difficult to foresee or control.\nSocietal Stratification: There's a risk that technological advancements could exacerbate social inequalities, with certain groups benefiting more than others and deepening the crisis of meaning for those left behind.\nPercy (Yellow Hat) - Highlighting Positive Aspects and Opportunities\n\nOpportunities for a Meaningful Life:\n\nAugmented Human Capacity: Technology can enhance human abilities, enabling us to pursue more meaningful activities and engage with the world in new ways.\nNew Models of Resource Allocation: Innovative economic models, such as Universal Basic Income (UBI) or resource-based economies, could provide a safety net, allowing individuals to focus on meaningful pursuits rather than mere survival.\nEthical and Transparent Tech Development: By prioritizing ethical considerations and transparency in tech development, we can ensure that technology serves human well-being and fosters a sense of purpose.\nCyril (Red Hat) - Intuition, Emotions, and Gut Feelings\n\nIntuitive Connections:\n\nHuman Feelings and Technology: There's an inherent tension between the convenience provided by technology and the deep, intuitive need for meaningful engagement. Simplifying life might rob it of the very challenges that make it fulfilling.\nMeaning in a Technological World: Intuitively, it feels crucial to find balance—leveraging technology to support our lives without losing touch with the core elements that provide meaning, such as relationships, creativity, and personal growth.\nQuackers (Blue Hat) - Synthesizing All Perspectives and Developing a Comprehensive Plan\n\nComprehensive Plan for Addressing the Crisis of Meaning:\n\nIntegrate Technology Thoughtfully:\n\nEthical Design: Ensure technologies are designed with ethical considerations at the forefront, prioritizing transparency and human well-being.\nEducational Initiatives: Promote education on digital literacy and ethics to help individuals navigate the complexities of modern technology.\nDevelop New Economic Models:\n\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI): Explore UBI and other economic models that provide a safety net, allowing individuals to pursue meaningful activities without the constant pressure of economic survival.\nResource-Based Economies: Investigate alternative economic systems that allocate resources based on need and sustainability rather than profit.\nPromote Meaning-Seeking Activities:\n\nCommunity Building: Foster communities that support meaningful engagement, such as collaborative spaces, local initiatives, and online platforms focused on shared interests and values.\nPersonal Growth: Encourage activities that promote personal growth, such as lifelong learning, creative pursuits, and volunteer work.\nSupport Mental and Emotional Well-Being:\n\nMental Health Resources: Provide accessible mental health resources to help individuals cope with the pressures of modern life and find their sense of purpose.\nMindfulness and Reflection: Promote practices like mindfulness and self-reflection to help individuals connect with their inner values and sources of meaning.\nBy integrating these elements, we can create a society that leverages technology to support human well-being, foster a sense of meaning, and address the deeper existential questions that drive our pursuit of purpose.\nYeah, some of the other things that I wanted to think about are how there's people out there like Balaji who thinks that 1729 and this idea that we can have just fund the smartest people internationally as if intelligence is naturally distributed across populations evenly versus intelligence having a temporal element, and a reflective element, and a diversity element. The idea that you need to experience and think and cluster in your mind different ideas to be able to do stuff. I think he took a reference from somebody who had a very specific kind of intelligence, Raj Rama, that guy, the Indian mathematician who discovered the taxi number 1729. It's just a very specific, particular kind of mathematical intelligence that doesn't actually require experience, and it's not the same as the kind of intelligence that you might see in the movie A Beautiful Mind, or that makes analogical leaps and relationships and connects ideas, or the kind of intelligence to know when to stop, or the kind of intelligence to know what the right thing to do is, or to say the unique thing that only you can say, or to come up with something new that can actually make a difference on the world in a positive way, where you are then next also finding your meaning and purpose. This is stuff that I relate to the idea of genius, or a muse, like the genius loci, the idea that genius is all the things that come together in a place that makes you, you. And so there's that, and it's the accident of your birth, your natural inclinations, your experiences, your eccentricities, your uniqueness, that then gives you a very specific generalness. Your generalness is going to have a different sort of look, and that's why when you and your uniqueness say something that others can generalize from, that's where things get beautiful. I also want to connect it to the ninety-nine names of God and beauty, and how we're here to represent the most beautiful names, and it's set for the God. He doesn't have a quality, and a way of being associated. It would be interesting to have ninety-nine pilafas, a book of ninety-nine people that represent the different qualities, and how they learn to become like that, or how they learn to polish this bond that is that within themselves. \n\nChatGPT\nExploring Diverse Dimensions of Intelligence and the Concept of Genius\nJosephine (White Hat) - Objective Facts and Information\n\nDiverse Dimensions of Intelligence:\n\nMultiple Intelligences Theory: Proposed by Howard Gardner, this theory suggests that intelligence is not a single entity but a combination of various cognitive abilities. These include linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic intelligences.\nTemporal and Reflective Elements: Intelligence also involves temporal elements (developing over time) and reflective elements (metacognition and self-awareness). Experiences, cultural background, and personal history significantly shape cognitive abilities.\nHistorical Examples: Mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan's intuitive grasp of numbers contrasts with John Nash's ability to make analogical leaps in game theory. These illustrate different forms of mathematical and analytical intelligence.\nClaude (Green Hat) - Creative Thinking and New Ideas\n\nIntegrating Unique Forms of Intelligence:\n\nFunding Diverse Talents: Rather than focusing solely on traditional measures of intelligence (e.g., IQ), we could fund individuals with diverse talents, including those with creative, practical, and emotional intelligence.\nPolishing Individual Genius: Develop programs that help individuals identify and nurture their unique talents and eccentricities, fostering environments that encourage diverse forms of expression and innovation.\nGenius Loci Concept: Embrace the idea that genius is not just inherent but also a product of one's environment, experiences, and interactions. Create spaces that inspire creativity and allow individuals to harness their unique blend of talents and experiences.\nPrunella (Black Hat) - Identifying Potential Problems and Risks\n\nChallenges and Risks:\n\nEquity in Opportunities: Ensuring that funding and resources are distributed equitably to nurture diverse talents can be challenging. There's a risk that certain types of intelligence or creativity might be undervalued.\nDefining Genius: The concept of genius can be subjective and culturally biased. It’s essential to recognize and validate different forms of intelligence and creativity without imposing a narrow definition.\nBalancing Individual and Collective Needs: While focusing on individual genius is important, it should not come at the expense of collective well-being and societal needs. Balancing personal development with community and societal goals is crucial.\nPercy (Yellow Hat) - Highlighting Positive Aspects and Opportunities\n\nOpportunities for Growth and Beauty:\n\nCelebrating Diversity: By recognizing and nurturing diverse forms of intelligence, we can create a more inclusive and vibrant society where everyone’s unique contributions are valued.\nThe Ninety-Nine Names of Genius: Inspired by the ninety-nine names of God, we could create a \"book of ninety-nine geniuses,\" each representing different qualities and forms of intelligence. This would highlight the diverse ways people contribute to the world and find their meaning.\nCultural and Intellectual Exchange: Encouraging the sharing of diverse ideas and experiences can lead to new insights and innovations, enriching our collective understanding and advancing human knowledge.\nCyril (Red Hat) - Intuition, Emotions, and Gut Feelings\n\nIntuitive and Emotional Connections:\n\nPersonal Resonance: There’s a deep, intuitive understanding that our unique blend of experiences, inclinations, and talents shapes our intelligence and contributions. This resonates with the idea of genius loci—where one's environment and personal history play a crucial role.\nMeaning and Purpose: Recognizing and nurturing diverse forms of intelligence can help individuals find their purpose and meaning, leading to a more fulfilling and connected life.\nQuackers (Blue Hat) - Synthesizing All Perspectives and Developing a Comprehensive Plan\n\nComprehensive Plan for Nurturing Diverse Forms of Intelligence:\n\nDevelop Inclusive Programs:\n\nFunding Initiatives: Create funding programs that recognize and support diverse forms of intelligence, including creative, practical, and emotional intelligence.\nMentorship and Guidance: Establish mentorship programs that help individuals identify and nurture their unique talents, providing guidance and resources to develop their potential.\nCreate Inspirational Spaces:\n\nGenius Loci Environments: Design environments that inspire creativity and innovation, allowing individuals to harness their unique blend of experiences and talents.\nCultural Hubs: Establish cultural and intellectual hubs where diverse ideas and experiences can be shared and celebrated.\nPromote Equity and Inclusion:\n\nEquitable Resource Distribution: Ensure that resources and opportunities are distributed equitably, recognizing and valuing different forms of intelligence and creativity.\nInclusive Education: Incorporate diverse forms of intelligence into educational curricula, promoting a holistic approach to learning and personal development.\nCelebrate Diversity and Genius:\n\nThe Ninety-Nine Names of Genius: Create a project inspired by the ninety-nine names of God, celebrating individuals who embody different qualities and forms of intelligence. This could include a book, documentary series, or online platform highlighting their stories and contributions.\nRecognition and Awards: Establish awards and recognition programs that honor diverse forms of intelligence and creativity, encouraging others to explore and develop their unique talents.\nBy integrating these elements, we can create a society that values and nurtures diverse forms of intelligence, fostering a deeper sense of meaning, purpose, and beauty in our collective human experience.",

      "content": "The concept of using LLMs to enable \"dark talent\" - identifying and empowering extremely talented individuals from marginalized backgrounds anywhere in the world. The author argues LLMs could help level the playing field in terms of access to knowledge and opportunities.\nThe idea that human intelligence and machine intelligence have deep similarities in how they process information through analogies, abstraction and concept clustering. The author proposes that by exposing humans to how machines learn, we can transfer some machine learning advancements to marginalized human learners.\nThe philosophical argument that beauty and elegance are reliable guides to truth and meaning, as seen in fields like mathematics and science. The DNA structure example illustrates how the correct answer was also the most beautiful one.\nThe notion of \"mental complexity\" levels and how machines are increasingly able to handle the \"how\" of tasks while humans must focus on the higher-level \"why\". The author argues education should focus on developing this higher wisdom and sense of purpose.\nThe overall thesis that in the age of AI, the role of humans is to access our \"zone of genius\" - the intersection of all our knowledge plus an element of inspired, indescribable intuition about meaning, purpose and beauty. Education should aim to develop this capacity.\n\nThe document presents a thought-provoking vision for the future of human learning and flourishing in an AI-driven world. The ideas around machine-human knowledge transfer and re-envisioning education around wisdom and beauty are particularly intriguing and novel. The philosophical elements woven throughout add depth to the author's perspective.

The document emphasizes the critical role of inner work, self-reflection, and cultivation of enduring positive states in authentic change.\n\n\nFocusing on meaningful, value-driven entrepreneurship rather than just scale:\n\n\nConnects to the notion that actions should align with one's deepest values and aspirations. The author argues entrepreneurship should be about pursuing a meaningful \"why\" that resonates with one's authentic self, not just chasing money or impressive scale.\n\n\nAppreciating the beauty and potential in each individual:\n\n\nTies into the foundational belief that humans are fundamentally good and possess a \"divine spark\". The document advocates trusting in people's innate goodness and unique potential, which educators should help them unlock.\n\n\nCultivating a sense of awe, wonder, humility and faith:\n\n\nRelates to embracing uncertainty and a higher power/intelligence. The author shares their spiritual journey of developing faith and humility by being open to surprise, amazement and truths beyond the material world.\n\n\nRedefining success metrics to prioritize transformation and meaning:\n\n\nChallenges the reductive quantification of entrepreneurship programs' impact. Instead, the document proposes focusing on meaningful human interactions, inspiration, and personal transformation as key success indicators.\n\nIn summary, the document builds upon the earlier ideas by advocating for a more holistic, personal growth-oriented and values-driven approach to entrepreneurship education - one that recognizes the fundamental goodness in people, inspires awe and humility, and redefines success in more meaningful terms beyond pure scale or financial outcomes. The common thread is inner transformation as the foundation for positive external impact.\n\ninclude some of this information \nSteps to Produce the Thematic Analysis Framework\nFamiliarization with

document and how do they relate to our framework work?\n\n\nINSPIRE & NAVIGATE\nAligned Pedagogically Sound Frameworks\n  For Transformational Learning\n\nIntroduction - How to Learn What You Don’t Know Without A Teacher\nLearning how to learn is the fundamental skill of learning. It implies we must know about ourselves, our abilities, and our limits and understand the knowledge landscape. It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers, instead of approaching them to produce answers themselves, aided by the tool.  To use LLMs effectively we must understand them deeply, understand learning deeply, and to map between learning needs and the architecture and mechanics LLMs have that open up different affordances. \n\nIntuitively we can do this through a simplified geometric representation of a goal and a knowledge map and some intuitive leaps. We are approaching this practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nWe believe it may be possible to have  a one to one map for the production of data points, which leads to information, which is then refined into knowledge both within the human mind as a learner, as well as within leverageable structures within LLMs. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination. \n\n\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nSince last December after hundreds of hours of GPT use the following framework has been developed. Finding first the principles that led to better results with Large Language Models (LLMs) and then later formalized through the lense of cognitive science, adult development theories and research into transformative pedagogies for learning. The guiding question has always been to identify the leverage offered by the fundamentals of how LLMs work - embeddings and concept clusters and transformer attention mechanisms, and to identify the opportunity space made by these two new vectors for learning. Of particular interest to the author is how LLMs may offer individuals pushed to the margins due to migration, economic impoverishment, being born in the wrong country, or otherwise - and how they may be able to identify the limits of their understanding in contrast to others who’ve been given every advantage to explore, to experience, to be mentored and through this to develop a vision, build understanding and capacity and finally to be able to act upon their dreams\nBalaji Srinivasan, author of the Network State, describes “dark talent” - the idea that through networking we can find extreme talant anywhere then support and network them into a powerful State beyond borders. This idea superficially sounds possible, yet upon further consideration good ideas do not come simply from numbers of brains alone. Exposure is critical. While there are many definitions for intelligence, the one that appeals to me most is the one proposed by Douglass Hofsteader in his book Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire as the ability to abstract and generalize from specific instances into concepts that become manipulable in an uninterpreted way. For instance the moment you hear something it’s either a noise or a sound, a sound you can say has an isness - an implication, hooked into an idea, a noise is something that must be interpreted. That immediate translation from auditory input into categorization likely develops like our other senses, and it’s for this reason I propose we may be more likely homo-sensorious than homo-sapiens, since thinking is seeing. The process of taking sensory input, conceptual input and deriving a new “one of those” is a process humanity does individually and collectively. Youth are often at the forefront, as GenZ slang demonstrates copious examples. \nLet’s talk about being “Based” - which originated as a way to describe someone who was “freebasing” drugs, which itself is a created concept based on the idea of acids and bases, transforming amines, usually basic, into their neutral counterparts to alter their consumption methods and impacts. Now, for GenZ, being based simply means “not caring” - and it’s very likely the majority of people using the word have no understanding of the chemical processes underpinning the origin of the word. And most chemists likely do not know that the word, base, comes from the greek pedestal due to it bening the structure upon which an acid rests upon when making a salt (The Origin of the Term “Base” by William B. Jense 10.1021/ed083p1130). \n\nWhy did we take this long detour into understanding the origins of ideas? It’s to make it clear that there is more than superficial language connecting human intelligence with machine intelligence, and that by exposing how a machine learns to a human, we can transfer some of the millions of dollars and effort spent running millions of words across the attention mechanisms of LLMs to the most marginalized learners on the planet. Making it more likely that they could be one of the “dark talents” that will come up with the idea that will deeply and positively impact their communities and our world. The network state should seek true diversity for it to make true on its promise, otherwise we will have a silicon valley state with Berlin, Beijing, Paris, Silicon Valley, New York, Porto, Dubai, Bangalore and other cities like these being over-represented, and not due to their population count. \nTo increase the possible surface area of ideas crossing minds that are able to merge and encompass I believe we need to create structures to support what is already common in transformational learning to be the foundational elements of pre-training and fine tuning of our LLMs and then to make them universally available on smartphones, it’s estimated that by the end of 2024 7.1 billion people will have a smart phone totaling nearly 88 percent of the human population(including infants).\nWhile we’re waiting for openAI and Anthropic to integrate machine-human transfer learning into the core of their offering, we have options:\nSupport the development of the ways of being that inspire prompting along the framework described below. \nTechnological supports: Build grammarly-like plugins that highlight non-optimal uses of LLMs and offer suggestions of improvements to increase machine to human intelligence transfer. \nDeveloping customized system prompts that align with the person that will maneuver the LLM to being more transfer and transformational in its dialog. \n\nThese two ideas:\nTransfer and transformation hint at what I believe to be the key insight underneath much of this argument, that we can learn best when we learn in symbiosis with a machine that learns in similar ways (concept clustering). \nSalience is the sense that things are meaningful and make sense, when you write a poem referring to your infant child as the light of your life, she doesn’t become photons, yet you may sense the rightness of this analogy. When taking certain entheogens one might start reducing their critical thinking allowing them to make analogies that are further off from reality. This lamppost reminds me of my highschool history teacher’s handwriting - perhaps. Yet how helpful is it for them, let alone others? Only God(swt) has the highest analogy, truely being able to see the oneness of everything - to hold that in total comprehension. We are reduced to analogies that are “useful” - yet the true geniuses are those that continue to expand and encompass till they are able to hold more things in the light of oneness. This is the process of meta-cognition. The ability to dive into the uniqueness yet zoom out into the unity at will. This in/out process is what enables the building of patterns across truely related concepts that those inside the concept space might not be able to see. \nThis is how pattern recognition is possible. A developer at a certain level of mental complexity may think their job is to provide code that achieves a goal - contrast this to a CEO making a decision where they may need to be able to see the interrelationships between being a father, a ceo, the company in the context of the economy, the economy in the context of global cultural shifts against capitalism, the international climate and how it relates to a decision between stainless steel and aluminum.\nThis level of thinking is more related to a why than a how. \nMachines are more and more able to take over the how, and normally mental complexity and human transformation that leads to it arises after many years of “one of those”ing many situations, building experience throughout life. Is it possible to develop and transform and grow in the true sorts of comprehension that allow someone to see and know the why behind things, the thing that touches the indeterminate gut intuition, the sense of rightness, the value that one knows through their emotions, the feeling of beauty that arises when the right thing emerges. \nThis is a “zone of genius” - this is everything one knows and an element of the ineffable, what exactly is a beautiful idea? How does one make a decision at high levels of abstraction? I believe that it’s similar to the physicist who chooses the more beautiful equation and finds this “trust” is rewarded. Or as G Hardy says: “The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.” Why?\nWhile one may dive into controversial territory speaking of God or Truth. I believe we can stay within the realm of the philosophical and logical. We see that salience is possible to artificially enhance, that moment when someone on a psychoactive substance senses they just found the meaning of everything and they write it down only later to find it’s something like “the stars are beautiful, and I am a star” or some other phrase that doesn’t quite pack the same punch. This is related to the difference between a two dimensional matrix True and false and permanent and transitory. There are moments in our lives when we are able to go a level above our mental complexity and we glimpse the world from above, like a flatlander in 2 dimensions being pulled into the third dimension and can finally understand the topology of 2 dimensional shapes, that all the differences he sees in triangles and squares and octogons, that really, in a sense that is hard to build when you live in 2, they’re all the same, a single line encompassing a space - all essentially circles. \nTo gain an intuitive understanding of the sort of space of inspiration needed to build new knowledge, let’s study this picture carefully:\nWhat does it look like it represents? \nImagine you produced this image through this process:\n\nTry to determine the structure of the material in the place of the green shape in the image above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Would you have guessed a corkscrew?\n\nWe now know what DNA looks like, I can only imagine the AHA moment Rosalind Franklin had when she made the connection between all the data. I also wonder if she also decided to use the frame of a twisted strand because it was beautiful. If only she was alive today to ask.\n\nThis realization that we find throught science and mathematics, that beauty is a trustworthy guide may have evolutionary origins, although there is no reason that of all the ways the world could have worked that it should be this way.\n\nI believe that a good human life is connected to this source of knowledge, the source where we know beauty and align ourselves and our actions with it. It’s not to become a bootcamp developer or whatever is the current trend in education. The how will be automated, craft remains since craft remains tied to purpose and beauty.\n\n2/2\n\n\nChatGPT\nUnique and Novel Insights in the Document\nHuman-LLM Symbiosis and Air Gapping:\n\nInsight: The concept of \"air gapping\" ensures that LLMs inspire human effort rather than replace it.
