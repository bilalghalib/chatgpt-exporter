Sallamu’alaykum\n\nSummary\nIn this transcript, the speaker discusses a variety of interrelated topics focusing on the notion of wholeness, the role of the heart or inner faculty in discerning truth, and the way Western philosophical and historical events—such as the Black Plague, Enlightenment thinkers, and Darwin—have contributed to a fragmented mindset. They emphasize the importance of reintroducing a sense of spiritual and emotional wholeness in personal and societal development, particularly in projects aimed at social change. They also speak about their desire to connect with an authentic tradition (possibly in an Islamic context) to validate their insights and develop confidence.\nA practical method mentioned is the process of examining one’s “To Do List” through the lens of “want to” versus “have to,” with the aim of reconnecting to deeper meaning, joy, and alignment with one’s true purpose or divine guidance.\n\nConcepts, Ideas, and Themes\nFoundational Schemas and Perceptual Faculty of Wholeness\nDisconnection and Burnout in Social Enterprises\nSocratic Method and Inner Knowledge (‘Ruh’)\nGod Confidence vs. Self-Confidence\nHistorical and Philosophical Influences on Western Mindsets\nBlack Plague\nEnlightenment Thinkers (Descartes, Galileo, Hobbes)\nDarwinism\nFear, Hierarchy, and Bureaucracy\nDecolonialization and Fear\nRole of the Heart (Spiritual/Inner Perception) in Knowing\nGentle Opening of the Heart’s Insight\nBalancing Rationality with a Holistic Perspective\nHealing, Wholeness, and the Metaphor of Honey and Black Seed\nProcess of ‘Come Alive’ (Examining Tensions in the To Do List)\nDifference Between ‘Have To’ and ‘Want To’\nConnecting to Meaning, Joy, and the Source of Good\nDesire to Join an Authentic Tradition or Chain\n\nVersion 2:\nIntroduction\nI've been thinking about these foundational schemas that we use to see the world and about how this way of disconnection from a perception of wholeness—the idea that we have a perceptual faculty as a civilization—shapes our reality. As a society, we are gas lit to refuse to acknowledge, even though most people will admit their perceptual faculty of recognizing love, meaning, beauty, and truth is real. Part of my focus is on how this ties into the burnout we experience when we try to “change the world” without including ourselves in that world.\nI hope to connect these reflections to various strands of thought, possibly including Islamic psychology, to better understand how we might bring back a sense of wholeness, “whole seeing,” and a heart-centered approach to knowledge. I would be honored if anyone with more formal training could give me a gut check on where my head is going and how I might improve my thinking.\n\n1. Foundational Schemas and a Lack of Wholeness\nThis disconnection from wholeness is closely linked to how we dismiss our inherent perceptual faculty. Even though we recognize love, meaning, beauty, and truth, we often treat these as mere emotions rather than valid forms of knowing. In developing truly impactful social enterprises, or in endeavors to “change the world,” we burn out if we fail to include ourselves. The problem partially lies in ignoring the whole of our being—neglecting both heart and mind.\nConnecting these observations with principles from Islamic psychology (or other spiritual traditions) suggests that recognizing and nurturing our deeper, holistic faculties might be key. This is not merely an intellectual exercise; it is also an emotional and spiritual orientation that acknowledges how a sense of wholeness combats burnout and fuels meaningful action.\n\n2. The Socratic Method, Self-Confidence, and ‘Ruh’\nSometimes, I grapple with my own lack of confidence because I’m not formally trained. I’ve listened to a thousand YouTube videos and been to a few classes, but I wonder whether I have anything important to share. Yet the idea of the Socratic method being an indication of the ruh—the inner spirit—resonates with me deeply. It suggests we can discern knowledge from within, creating a space for people to uncover understanding through practice and introspection.\nFor me, this brings up the distinction between self-confidence and “God confidence.” It feels crucial not to doubt my curiosities, interests, and diverse educational backgrounds, as long as I stay aligned with something higher. By trusting that this curiosity comes from a place of authenticity, I’m encouraged to keep exploring and to present these thoughts in a way that is clearer and more structured.\n\n3. History, Western Philosophy, and the ‘Mind Virus’\nPart of my exploration involves history: considering what the Black Plague in Europe did to the mindset of Europeans, leading to a rejection of God and the eventual rise of Enlightenment thinking. From the Roman Empire’s hierarchy merging with Constantine’s bureaucratic approach to the influence of Hobbes and Descartes, the Western tradition has often been suspicious of human nature, viewing it as “nasty, brutish, and short.”\nDarwin tells us all humans want is to procreate, reinforcing a belief that there is nothing more profound inside each person. Consequently, this perspective encourages systems of domination, calculation, and control—market systems, fines, fees, and jails—over a more trusting and emergent sense of human goodness. This is what I sometimes refer to as a “mind virus” that has infected the world, creating fear and distrust in our inherent capacities for love, meaning, and spiritual perception.\n\n4. Perceptual Faculties and the Heart’s Knowing\nAgainst this backdrop, I wonder what it would look like to recognize another quality of perception, one that Socrates suggested we can access by continually asking questions and digging within ourselves. There’s something that knows right from wrong, echoing the saying of Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam: “Put something against your heart and see if it shakes.”\nWhere does this knowing come from? Opening the “eye of the heart” can be a way for everyone, regardless of background, to see more deeply. It may also offer a gentler approach to decolonialization—recognizing that colonialism might have been a Band-Aid covering fear of death, fear of the world, and fear of each other. So instead of simply ripping off the Band-Aid, we might try to lovingly peel it off to see what wisdom might flourish when the heart’s knowing is trusted.\n\n5. Healing, Wholeness, and Sharing the Vision\nMy thinking involves pairing the bitter with the sweet—like honey and black seed—to address how the Western mindset evolved and to offer a healthier alternative. By gently helping people who are deeply invested in a materialist worldview regain even an iota of fitra (the innate human disposition), I see a pathway toward healing.\nI’m developing this understanding for myself through a framework that I’m calling “come alive.” It’s about working with the perceptual faculty of tension, using something as simple as a To Do List to see where we linger in what we want and where we feel forced by what we have to do. This is often how we reinforce systems that go against our true desires and how we disconnect from the source of all good.\n\n6. The ‘Have To’ vs. ‘Want To’ Approach\nWhen someone brings their To Do List, we examine which items they genuinely want to do and which items they feel they have to do. The have to’s typically carry tension. We race through them, delegate them, or view them as burdens. This habit can gradually erode our connection to meaning, joy, and possibility.\nHowever, it doesn’t mean that every have to is negative. Sometimes, you might set your alarm because you want to wake up for Fajr (the pre-dawn prayer). This transforms a have to into a want to through a shift in intention. By reexamining these assumptions, we can rediscover what truly nourishes us and fosters alignment with our deeper values.\n\n7. Moving Forward with a Tradition and a Chain\nUltimately, I recognize my own need for belonging to a tradition—a clearer chain of guidance. I have intuitions, feelings, and research, but aligning with a lineage or discipline provides grounding and confidence. This could be Islamic psychology, or it might be something else that honors the interplay between heart and mind. Either way, finding a spiritual or intellectual chain ensures I’m not misled by my curiosities. It helps integrate my diverse background and God confidence into a coherent path forward.\n\nConclusion\nReconnecting with wholeness means acknowledging a perceptual faculty beyond mere rational calculation—one that recognizes love, beauty, and truth as real. We can trace the roots of our fragmented worldview back through history and philosophy, yet we also have the capacity to open the eye of the heart. By consciously distinguishing between have to and want to, by trusting the ruh or the spirit within, and by engaging in gentle decolonialization, we can heal ourselves and the systems we operate in.\nThis work, whether through an established tradition or through personal exploration, requires courage, curiosity, and kindness. It is a reminder that we need to include ourselves in the world we want to improve, bridging the gap between intellect and heart so that our actions arise from a place of wholeness.\n\nVersion 3:\nIntroduction\nIt’s my intention that this becomes a snapshot of my thinking about the truths I’ve discovered in my life and the realities they imply for living a good life—particularly in the face of our sense of speed, rush, fear, otherness, alienation, and impending disaster. My mom shared with me, back in October 2011, the Eid prayer from Mecca, and in that prayer, the speaker mentioned the idea that God is beautiful and loves that which is beautiful. At the time, I was hurt and struggling to accept the tradition I’d been raised with because it seemed to interfere with me trusting my heart. Yet that tension, that reality, set in motion a series of reflections about the interplay between text, tradition, and the aliveness I felt inside.\n\n1. Confronting Fear and Confusion\nI remember laying on the ground outside when someone asked me, “Do you love me?” Instead of taking a breath to look inside my heart for the truth, I deflected. I asked for a literal definition of love, avoiding what I already knew within me. There are places within us that know love, that can distinguish it from lust. But in my confusion—and my desire to remain confused so I wouldn’t face the pain of confronting my family or my own identity—I created more conflict for myself. I lived like a zombie, sneaking out at night to let the parts of me that were alive breathe in the shadows.\nThen, in October 2011, I received one key of a sort of trifecta that helped me open my heart, reconnect with my emotions, and trust my perception of beauty and meaning again. I realized that beauty is the splendor of truth, that beauty draws you into love, and that the faculty of perceiving beauty is also inextricable from the reality of knowing what is good, true, and meaningful.\n\n2. The Faculty That Sees Beauty\nThis faculty within us that recognizes beauty is the same place where we can answer the questions about what is really true and good, and how we should live. My background in science, technology, and philosophy often pulled me toward rational explanations and control. But I started to see that this controlling mindset can disconnect us from the reality of the bird: waking up in fear and hope, leaving its nest in search of sustenance with awe and wonder, grateful for what it finds. That way of being uses both eyes—one rational, the other connected to the heart.\nI realized that my rejection of the tradition that was originally teaching me how to open the “eye of the heart” limited my ability to walk the tightrope of life with confidence. Keeping my eyes focused on beauty while also planning and planting seeds is a delicate balance. You know the rope will move. You don’t know if the next step will land. But you trust. For me, that trust is echoed in the Islamic tradition, where God-consciousness and faith lead one to success. It is not about blind leaps but about step-by-step learning and seeing—like the bird discovering worms, or the tightrope walker feeling the invisible line beneath each foot.\n\n3. A Destructive Stasis and the Roots of Alienation\nOur society’s stasis has become destructive. We remain stuck in systems that alienate us from our perceptual faculty of beauty, truth, and goodness. We can’t keep telling ourselves that these are just “mere emotions” or illusions. If we watch a film about Nelson Mandela and feel uplifted and inspired, that sense of possibility and hope matters. Yet fear often stops us from acting on it.\nWhen I lost someone dear to me, it was because I couldn’t face the reality of my own love—of my own heart’s knowing. I didn’t understand that love is the splendor of truth, that beauty, truth, and love intertwine, and that if I want to know God, I have to “read” all three books: revelation, inner insight (feelings, thoughts, self-reflection), and the outer world (the beauty of nature, the signs of pollution and destruction).\n\n4. Signs and Missteps in Human Progress\nI began to see the signs of repulsion in polluted rivers, the squalor of 1800s London, the miseries of industrialization, and the illusions of progress. So much technology, ironically, stems from fear or the desire to dominate. The “mind virus” of materialism led us to exploit the world through hierarchical systems—like capitalism and neoliberalism—often built on a single, rational eye that sees resources, markets, profits, and efficiency, but not the other eye that perceives beauty and meaning.\nDopamine teaches us to chase rewards, imagining that tomorrow will be better, that we’re building heaven in some future realm. Meanwhile, we pollute the present. We rationalize decisions like the lobotomy and nitrogen-fixing fertilizers—originally inventions motivated by some form of love or survival—only to watch them become monstrous when adopted for profit or destructive pursuits.\n\n5. The Eye of the Heart: Rediscovering Wholeness\nYet there’s another way. We can open that other eye, the eye of the heart, and many of us caught a glimpse of it during the pandemic. People stayed home, baked sourdough, and reconnected with crafts and arts—collaborating with yeast and flour instead of rushing off to busy offices. That may seem trivial, but it reflects how we can be co-creators with nature, savor time, and share the fruits of our labor.\nWe’re always told to do gratitude practices, but they sometimes clash with an underlying entitlement or the leftover illusions of control. Opening the eye that perceives beauty requires humility. It demands daily practice, daily listening, daily risk—trusting that infinite goodness can unfold in each moment if we’re sensitive to it.\n\n6. Releasing Fear, Embracing Love\nMy own story shows how living in that fear can hold us back. Yet when I met my wife, I finally decided to trust that faculty inside me. Even though our background, cultures, and languages seemed incompatible at first glance, I felt my shoulders drop when I held her. There was a leaning-in, a “yes.” I suspect that what religions call “God” is a oneness that exists outside time, urging us toward the next step in a greater, mysterious story. Small experiments with beauty lead us deeper into trust and alive-ness.\nThis perspective helps me reflect on the frameworks and worldviews we’ve adopted. It helps me see how we’ve turned many people’s misery and the planet’s suffering into mere means to an end, as if fulfilling the UN Sustainable Development Goals or building a social enterprise is always a matter of measured outcomes and philanthropic ROI. But real transformation, I believe, requires a bottom-up blossoming, like seeds that break open in fertile soil. Let people discover their own sources of meaning and follow the threads of their own aliveness.\n\n7. Seeds of a More Beautiful World\nWhen I was younger, I worked in Iraq and saw the international NGOs arrive, looking for women’s tech businesses to fund. They cropped up overnight. But real growth and lasting change unfold more organically. It’s fluid, adaptive, daily, like the bird leaving the nest again and again, trusting worms will be found.\nIn a world accelerating toward climate crisis, social upheaval, and spiritual alienation, I believe the solution isn’t in building higher walls or “escaping” to Mars. It’s in re-engaging with the faculty that perceives deeper truth, wonders at the infinite variety of possibility, and resonates with beauty as it emerges. That place within us directs our attention in ways that complex systems and measurements can’t capture.\n\n8. Conclusion: Living in Aliveness\nI understand now that trusting the eye of the heart doesn’t exclude using our rational faculties. We can still plant seeds, manage resources, and plan for the future. The difference is that every step becomes an act of beauty, an attempt to stay in harmony with the wonders unfolding around us. Our “success” is in each stride on the tightrope, each morning the bird leaves the nest, each moment we choose to see rather than control.\nIn my life, I see that coming alive doesn’t mean racing to build unstoppable technologies or forging bulletproof retirement plans. It means receiving the gifts of each day, letting them shape us and show us our next step. I hope there are critiques or suggestions that could refine my perspective, but for now, I hope you’re having a beautiful day—and that you’re opening up, day by day, to that which makes you come alive.\n\n\nSeeing With Both Eyes: A Path to Wholeness\nWe have been taught to distrust something fundamental within us: our perceptual faculty for recognizing love, meaning, beauty, and truth. As a society, we are gas lit to refuse to acknowledge this way of knowing, even though most people will admit they have it. We dismiss it as \"just emotions\" while burning ourselves out trying to change a world we've stopped fully seeing.\nThis disconnection stems from what might be called a mind virus - one that has infected our civilization through centuries of accumulated fear and control. From the Black Plague through the Enlightenment to modern times, Western thought has increasingly viewed humans as creatures to be managed rather than beings capable of emergence and beauty. This mindset tells us that everything must be accounted for, calculated, dominated, and controlled. We see this playing out in our market systems, our institutions, and even in how we relate to ourselves.\nBut what if we recognized that we have another quality of perception? One that connects us to a deeper knowing - not mere intuition, but a faculty that lets us perceive wholeness rather than just pieces. Think of it as having two eyes: one for rational analysis and one for holistic comprehension. Most of us have learned to rely almost entirely on the first while letting the second grow dim.\nThis shows up practically in how we approach even simple things like our daily to-do lists. We divide tasks into \"have to\" versus \"want to,\" and find ourselves constantly tensing against the \"have to's\" - rushing through them, delegating them, automating them. We race through dinner with family or rush past moments of potential beauty because we're caught in systems of obligation that we've internalized so deeply we forget to question them.\nThe path forward isn't about rejecting rationality or planning. Rather, it's about inverting our usual process. Instead of starting with calculation and control, then trying to squeeze in meaning and beauty, we can begin with our faculty for perceiving wholeness. This doesn't mean abandoning practical action - it means allowing our actions to emerge from a more complete way of seeing.\nThis isn't just personal - it's about healing our collective disconnection. When we step back from rushing to \"change the world\" and instead include ourselves in the world we want to improve, something shifts. We start to see that impact doesn't always mean scaling up. Sometimes it means getting smaller, more present, more connected to what's right in front of us. The world needs this more complete way of seeing now more than ever.\n",

These versions progress from a super-short TL;DR, to a 3-paragraph summary, to a 1-page expansion, a 2-page exploration, and finally a bullet-point outline.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Key Arguments, Themes, and Concepts\n\n- **Foundational Schemas & Wholeness**  \n  We have core ways of seeing the world that can either unite or fragment our sense of self. The speaker believes we’ve lost a direct sense of “wholeness,” leading to burnout and disconnection.\n\n- **Perceptual Faculty Beyond Rationality**  \n  There’s a faculty within us (the “eye of the heart,” or an inner sense) that recognizes love, beauty, and truth. Western culture often dismisses this as mere emotion, undermining its validity.\n\n- **Historical & Philosophical Roots**  \n  The speaker traces a “mind virus” to events and ideas—from the Black Plague to Enlightenment philosophers (Descartes, Hobbes, Darwin)—creating distrust in the innate goodness of human nature and favoring control, domination, and materialist systems.\n\n- **Burnout in Social Enterprises**  \n  Many people who aim to “change the world” exclude themselves from that care, leading to burnout. The speaker suggests an alternative: include oneself in the world you’re trying to help, guided by wholeness and the heart’s knowing.\n\n- **Socratic Method & “God Confidence”**  \n  The Socratic tradition implies we can discern knowledge from within. Rather than (or in addition to) self-confidence, the speaker champions “God confidence,” trusting that inner curiosity aligns with a higher source of truth.\n\n- **Want To vs. Have To (The “Come Alive” Process)**  \n  By examining our to-do lists, we see which tasks we truly want (aligned with meaning) versus those we only do out of obligation. Shifting from “have to” toward “want to” (or imbuing “have to” with the right intention) reconnects us to joy and authenticity.\n\n- **Gentle Decolonization**  \n  Rather than ripping away Western mindsets entirely, the speaker proposes a gentle unraveling of fear and doubt, allowing “the eye of the heart” to reopen—even for those invested in a materialist worldview.\n\n- **Desire for a Tradition**  \n  The speaker feels a need for formal grounding, perhaps through Islamic psychology or another chain of knowledge, to ensure these intuitions and explorations have a firm foundation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. A Proposed “Better Flow” for the Essay\n\n1. **Introduction & The Loss of Wholeness**  \n   - Present the core problem: We’re disconnected from a sense of wholeness, leading to burnout and alienation.\n2. **Historical Context & The Western “Mind Virus”**  \n   - Explore how major European historical events (Black Plague, Enlightenment, Darwinian views) fostered distrust in innate human goodness, elevating fear and control.\n3. **The Inner Faculty: Heart-Knowing & Socratic Roots**  \n   - Introduce the concept of a deeper perceptual faculty (the “eye of the heart”), linking it to spiritual and philosophical traditions (Socrates, Islamic teachings).\n4. **Practical Application: “Come Alive” and To-Do Lists**  \n   - Show how everyday choices (want to vs. have to) either fuel wholeness or reinforce disconnection.\n5. **Implications for Social Change & Decolonization**  \n   - Explain how wholeness-based thinking could address burnout in social enterprises and gently reframe Western-dominated mindsets.\n6. **Conclusion & Call to Tradition**  \n   - Emphasize the speaker’s personal need for a spiritual or psychological tradition to ground these insights—and invite readers to explore their own heart-knowing.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Multiple Versions of the Essay\n\n### A) **TL;DR (Very Short Summary)**\n\nWe often ignore our deeper sense of love, truth, and beauty, focusing on rational control instead. Historically, Western thought reinforced distrust in human nature, causing burnout and alienation. By gently reconnecting to our “heart sense” (the inner faculty that knows goodness), questioning our “have to” obligations, and including ourselves in the care we give the world, we can find wholeness and renew our confidence in life’s meaning.  \n\n---\n\n### B) **3-Paragraph Version**\n\n**1. Rediscovering Wholeness**  \nSociety trains us to dismiss an inner faculty that perceives love, meaning, and beauty. This leads to a fragmented sense of self and burnout, especially among those striving to change the world. The root of this disconnection can be traced back to centuries of Western history, from the trauma of the Black Plague to the influence of Enlightenment philosophers who favored control and suspicion of human nature.\n\n**2. The Heart’s Knowing**  \nAmid this mindset, we forget that we possess an innate ability—what some call the “eye of the heart”—to recognize when something feels right or wrong. This resonates with both the Socratic method of inner questioning and certain spiritual traditions that emphasize the heart as a seat of knowledge. By affirming this dimension of ourselves, we can counteract the materialistic “mind virus” and gently decolonize a worldview rooted in fear.\n\n**3. Practical Steps & Tradition**  \nA practical way to begin is to examine our daily tasks: which ones do we truly want to do versus those we force ourselves to do out of obligation? By reclaiming intention and aligning our actions with our deeper values, we can avoid burnout and discover renewed energy. Ultimately, grounding these insights in a respected tradition—such as Islamic psychology or another lineage—helps ensure a more confident path forward.\n\n---\n\n### C) **1-Page Version (Approx. 450–500 words)**\n\n**Reclaiming Our Inner Faculty for Wholeness**  \nWe live in a world where rational thinking often eclipses a subtler, yet vital faculty: the one that recognizes love, beauty, and truth. Many of us sense this inner perception, sometimes referred to as the “eye of the heart,” but we’re taught to dismiss it as mere emotion. This dismissal has profound consequences. People who dedicate their lives to social change frequently burn out because they forget to include themselves in their vision of a better world. Without wholeness—an integration of both mind and heart—they lose the very force that sustains meaningful effort.\n\nThe historical roots of this fragmentation run deep. The speaker traces them to a European context shaped by the Black Plague, Enlightenment thinkers like Descartes and Hobbes, and Darwin’s emphasis on survival and procreation. These narratives fostered a worldview that mistrusts human nature as essentially self-serving, thus justifying systems built on control, hierarchy, and materialistic values. While these ideas helped society develop science and technology, they also crowded out our capacity to see people (and ourselves) as inherently capable of good, beauty, and emergence.\n\nFortunately, a solution lies in reopening the “eye of the heart.” This approach acknowledges that rational thought and holistic perception can coexist. Socrates demonstrated a method of inner questioning; Islamic teachings reference the heart’s capacity to confirm moral truths. The key is to gently reawaken this deeper insight rather than discarding rationality. As the speaker suggests, gentle decolonization means carefully peeling back the layers of fear and distrust, rather than ripping them away altogether.\n\nOn a personal level, one way to rekindle this holistic vision is by noticing how often we act out of obligation rather than genuine alignment. Our to-do lists overflow with “have to” tasks that weigh us down. Re-examining those tasks—asking ourselves why we assume they’re necessary—can reveal unconscious beliefs rooted in fear or social expectations. By infusing intention even into obligations (for example, turning “I have to wake up early” into “I want to rise for a meaningful morning prayer”), we bring ourselves closer to wholeness.\n\nUltimately, the desire for a guiding tradition, such as Islamic psychology or another lineage, can give us confidence that these insights stand on firm ground. It encourages us to see that we aren’t alone in our quest; many spiritual and philosophical legacies affirm this dual faculty of mind and heart. Through integration, we can help heal ourselves and, by extension, contribute to a more holistic, compassionate world—one that sees beyond mere calculation to the full spectrum of human experience.\n\n---\n\n### D) **2-Page Version (Approx. 800–1000 words)**\n\n**Reconnecting with Wholeness: Seeing with Both Heart and Mind**\n\nModern life often compels us to operate as if rational analysis is the only valid way of knowing. At the same time, most of us sense a deeper faculty—a “heart sense” or an “eye of the heart” that perceives love, beauty, and meaning in ways logic alone cannot capture. Yet many feel pressured to dismiss this faculty as “just emotion.” The consequences of this dismissal can be seen in widespread burnout, particularly among people trying to “change the world.” Their goals are noble, yet they forget to include themselves and their own well-being in the process. Underneath it all lies a foundational disconnect: we live in a culture that tacitly tells us to tune out the heart and rely solely on measurable outcomes.\n\n**A Legacy of Distrust in Human Nature**  \nTo understand how we got here, we can look at historical forces that shaped Western thinking. After the Black Plague ravaged Europe, many people lost faith in traditional religious explanations and sought new forms of certainty. Later, Enlightenment thinkers—Descartes, Hobbes, Galileo—elevated the scientific method and rational discourse as primary tools for progress. While these developments advanced human knowledge, they also brought a suspicion of anything deemed unquantifiable. Hobbes’s characterization of human life as “nasty, brutish, and short” fueled systems of control, while Darwin’s evolutionary theory (focused on survival and procreation) suggested that at our core, we’re driven by raw impulses rather than innate goodness or spiritual insight.\n\nThis outlook frames reality as something to be dominated or managed. It underpins many modern institutions: market-driven economies, bureaucracies, and social norms that value efficiency over empathy. The speaker refers to this as a “mind virus”—a worldview that spreads distrust and overlooks the deeper capacity in each person for love, meaning, and emerging goodness. We end up with societies that measure success via productivity statistics, while ignoring the heart’s qualitative sense of what genuinely serves humanity.\n\n**The Heart’s Knowing & Socratic Method**  \nAmid this rational dominance, the speaker invokes multiple traditions that remind us of our deeper faculty. The Socratic method, for instance, invites us to ask honest questions until we uncover truths that lie within. Islamic psychology and spiritual teachings speak of a “ruh” or soul, and a heart that can confirm right from wrong—reflecting the prophet’s counsel to “put something against your heart and see if it shakes.” These traditions suggest that rational thought isn’t the enemy; it’s incomplete when severed from the holistic knowledge that includes love, beauty, and moral insight.\n\nThis dual perspective can serve as a corrective to extreme materialism or control-based ideologies. Consider the contemporary notion of “decolonization,” which aims to remove oppressive layers of Western thought. The speaker advises a gentle approach to peeling back the protective “Band-Aid” that colonialism offered—recognizing that behind hierarchical, fear-based systems lies real terror of death, the unknown, and each other. By addressing these fears directly and compassionately, rather than trying to rip the Band-Aid off in one violent motion, we stand a better chance at true healing.\n\n**Burnout, Social Change, and the To-Do List**  \nThis has practical implications for those working in social enterprises or community initiatives. The desire to “change the world” often leads to burnout when we neglect our own humanity. We become cogs in a system of endless tasks—“have to” items on our to-do lists. In the speaker’s process called “come alive,” the to-do list becomes a mirror for understanding where we invest our energy without joy, and where we sense genuine alignment (the “want to” tasks). By investigating each “have to,” we can ask: why do I believe this is necessary? Is there another way to do it, or a new intention that transforms it into a “want to”?\n\nWhile some obligations remain vital (e.g., working for a living or fulfilling familial responsibilities), shifting our perspective can help us reclaim agency. Waking up early for dawn prayer can change from a grudging “I must” to a nurturing “I want to,” if aligned with a conscious intention to cultivate spiritual awareness. Such shifts, though subtle, have profound effects. They free us from mechanical routine and remind us that meaning is often a matter of perspective and heart engagement.\n\n**Toward a Tradition and a Chain**  \nCentral to the speaker’s journey is the desire to be part of a recognized tradition, such as Islamic psychology or another lineage that respects this integration of heart and mind. Studying within a tradition provides grounding, so these insights aren’t purely personal musings but part of a collective wisdom passed down through generations. It addresses the speaker’s lingering doubt—born of not being “formally trained”—by offering a supportive framework and community.\n\n**Conclusion: Easing Back into Wholeness**  \nUltimately, the speaker’s message is an invitation to revive the faculty of wholeness we’ve been taught to ignore. Rational analysis and planning remain invaluable, but they should serve, not dominate, our deeper sense of wonder, love, and moral clarity. Just as a bird uses two eyes to navigate its surroundings, we can learn to use both our analytical mind and our heart’s insight to see the world in 3D again.\n\nBy recognizing that “we are part of the world we’re trying to help,” we can avoid the trap of self-sacrifice that leads to burnout. We allow ourselves to be guided by a holistic intelligence that sees beyond rigid control. In many spiritual traditions, this path is considered natural—it’s simply being fully human. And as we shift from “have to” to “want to,” we transform routine obligations into opportunities for purpose and connection. Over time, this gentle realignment can help us peel back fear and rediscover the beauty at the core of our existence.\n\n---\n\n### E) **Mostly Titles and Bullet Points (Easy to Scan)**\n\n**1.
