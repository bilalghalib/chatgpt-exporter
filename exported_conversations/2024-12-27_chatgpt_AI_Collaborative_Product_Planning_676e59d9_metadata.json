      "content": "I'm going to use two different AI agents and I want both agents to work together. I want one to be optimistic and hopeful and the other to be critical and to analyze. And what I want to do is give them a task and to have them sort of ping-pong back and forth with each other in a way that makes consistent progress to a defined endpoint with a finished product. I want them to work collaboratively on the idea of the end-of-year review product. It should be something that is sellable and they should come up with a plan for producing it and selling it and making sure that it is something that people want before selling it and they can leverage social media. We can make a social media account for them. They should come up with a name and it should be done within the next four days. So give me the prompts that I can use for each of them as a system prompt and let's begin this process. Also, ask me five clarifying questions in case you need help and want to make it improve the process.",

      "content": "Okay, so, target audiences. Um, you know, I sort of want to figure out what the most likely sale is. We're at December 26 right now, and I just want to catch people before the end of year holidays. Maybe I could post some stuff on Reddit, and like, maybe you have some ideas about good marketing, but I just want this thing to get out there and have two things. One is like, I want to be excited about it for the long term, and I want it to be something I'm proud of, and I want it to be something that makes passive income that's digital. I don't mind it being a physical product, especially if we can sell it on Etsy, you know, something quick. Um, or maybe something that's related, you know? Like, I kind of like the idea of, um, you know, using API calls to generate a letter that gets sent in the mail that they read, and then they can respond through the app or through an email to an API that touches GPT or something. I'm good at programming, relatively. I can hack things together, but it should be something that is very simple, is, like, coded here in our chats, but also, um, or, like, produced as a very simple SVG that I can, um, you know, put onto Etsy or something, or Printify, or you can produce an image, or, you know, I can, um, design something very simple. It doesn't have to be complicated to be good. Like, what is the easiest, most valuable thing? Also, think about everything that you know about me, and my skills, and my curiosities, and my growth, and my mindset, and the things that I can actually share that's valuable for other people. Um, I want you to think about the unique value proposition. What is something that I can do that other people wouldn't? There should be fun, formal, and address the reality that, you know, we're facing climate collapse, and a, like, 400 days of war in Palestine. It's like, what do you want to do? What are you going to do about it? Like, I've been struggling with that. I'm sure lots of people are kind of just feeling blah, and uneasy, and I don't even know the answer. Can you help me figure all this out? And ask any more questions that these, um, bring to you, and maybe, um, you can, uh, propose half the questions to me, and half the questions to the other AI agent. Um, you can be the positive AI agent, and, uh, the hopeful agent, and I'll send it over to, um, Agent B.",
