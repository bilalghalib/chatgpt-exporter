      "content": "Oof—that’s stressful. Yes, you likely have a reasonable case to ask Google for a billing adjustment/credit, especially if (a) this is your first month of API usage, (b) you believed your personal Gemini subscription covered it, and/or (c) usage was accidental or due to a leaky key. Here’s exactly how to tackle it fast.\n\n# What probably happened (in plain English)\n- **Gemini in the browser / Google AI Studio** is free to use (rate-limited). But **calling the Gemini API with an API key** is billed pay-as-you-go once you’re on the paid tier/limits, and that usage lands in your **Google Cloud Billing** account. citeturn0search2turn0search5\n\n# Step 1 — Stop the bleeding (takes a minute)\n1) **Disable the API key(s)** you were using:\n   - AI Studio → “API keys” → disable/rotate the key. citeturn0search8  \n2) **Put a budget cap + alerts** on the billing account (Billing → Budgets & alerts). citeturn0search9  \n3) **Set quotas** (Billing → Quotas / or per API) so this can’t reoccur. citeturn0search9\n\n# Step 2 — Gather the proof\nIn Google Cloud Console:\n- Billing → **Reports** → filter by project & service (“Gemini API” / “Generative Language”). Export the **cost table** and **daily cost** graph. Note any spikes and the **time window**. citeturn0search9  \n- Screenshot that the key is now **disabled/rotated**, and add a brief note that you assumed your **Gemini subscription** covered usage.\n\n# Step 3 — Open a Billing Support case (this is free)\nGoogle provides **Cloud Billing support** to all customers (no paid support plan needed). citeturn0search10  \n- In the Console: **Support → Cases → Create case** (choose your billing account/project). citeturn0search4turn0search1\n\n**What to ask for:** a **one-time courtesy billing adjustment** for unintended Gemini API charges, explaining the misunderstanding between your personal subscription and API billing.\n\nHere’s a tight message you can paste:\n\n> **Subject:** Request for billing adjustment — unintended Gemini API charges  \n> **Details:**  \n> Hello Cloud Billing team,  \n> I was charged ~$400 for Gemini API usage on Billing Account **[ID]**, Project **[ID]** between **[dates]**. I believed my personal Gemini subscription covered my usage and didn’t realize separate API calls would bill my Cloud account.  \n> As soon as I noticed, I **disabled/rotated** the API key and set budgets/quotas (screenshots attached). This is my **first** unexpected bill, and I can’t afford it.  \n> Could you please review and consider a **one-time courtesy credit/billing adjustment**? I’ve attached the Billing Reports (cost table + daily chart) and key-disable proof.  \n> Thank you so much for your help.\n\n(Attach: cost report exports + screenshots.)\n\n# Step 4 — If you suspect unauthorized use\n- Mention it in the ticket and include logs/timestamps. If you truly didn’t make the calls, your bank can treat it as a **chargeback** for unauthorized charges—but start with Google so it’s resolved cleanly. citeturn0search0\n\n# What gives you “a case”\n- **AI Studio (browser) is free**, which reasonably causes confusion vs. **API usage (billed)**. citeturn0search2turn0search5  \n- First-time, non-abusive, promptly-fixed mistakes often receive **billing adjustments** (Google’s billing support exists for exactly these issues). citeturn0search10\n\n# Prevent it next time (quick checklist)\n- Keep **separate projects/billing accounts** for experiments.  \n- Always set a **budget cap + alerts** before testing new APIs. citeturn0search9  \n- **Restrict API keys** by HTTP referrer / IP, and rotate regularly. citeturn0search8  \n- Verify **model pricing/limits** before running loops or long context calls. citeturn0search2turn0search5\n\nIf you want, tell me your **project name**, **billing account nickname**, and **the day the spike started**, and I’ll draft the case with your specifics filled in.",
