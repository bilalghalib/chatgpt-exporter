But uh our uh w Western society, uh based on science and uh capitalism and everything, those people are kind of believing in science neither than the believer take it try to take some steps back and understand the whole like uh uh where where we are our our planet in the universe and what is the universe, based time and uh how what do we know, what we don't know and uh how earth is uh uh uh working instead of uh saying it's doing that it is and uh we are running too much fuel, we are eating too much and it's we can do uh uh in another way. Yeah.  Like fatalism. Yeah. It's fatalism scientism and fatalism that are killing the the sacred uh and yeah, the sacred uh look at the wholeness and but this is why I wanted to get a very um historic view, you know, because you just look I was happening now.  I'm trying, yeah. This is a part of what I want to share. It's like the history. like is it we' just pop up here and and we aren't necessarily like, you know, some people think of progress like this, right?  It just goes, I guess, and we are seeing the most clearly right now. We have the best ideas, the best science, then will you ever have, and tomorrow will be even more clear and more true and more real. There's a Christian of what is progress.  What is progress or like what is true knowledge? And the thing is I don't want to talk negatively about capitalism or negatively about scientism, what I want to say is uh, where did those ideas emerge from? Why is it so much a dominant?  Yeah, and to show like, oh, well, it makes sense that we did that. But also, does it make sense that it we could be overdoing it? Because it does make sense to try to protect yourself, right?  Like let's say, you know, for instance, you've got to a car accident you weren't wearinging your seatbelt. You got hurt. And then after that you start wearing your seatbelt.  That's okay. That's a good lesson, right? And so part of the lesson that, you know, we could have used science to use if we had it back then, to learn about the black plague, is people would already concentrating into cities.  People were already over like I was doing this research today. There were depleting their farms. They were overproducing on their farms, they were getting less returns, so people were under nourished like cities were crowded and dirty and like the conditions were good for a plague, you know?  But uh that doesn't happen in in cultures that don't have something that makes people think the best the right thing, you know? And the to live, to live in this way to like uh have a, uh, also a part of it was the peasant and landowner relationship at this hierarchy of dominance, and that's why I had to go back before the black plague because the black plague made me realize a little bit more about like why people left religion and why people were looking for hedonism and more like focus on life and individualism, but before that there was this bringing in of hierarchy and power structures, because when Christianity was not formalized, it was very diverse, a lot of different opinions. There was nobody to tell you might think that other person is really wrong, but you and 100 people will think that them and 100 people there was no pope, there was no like massive Catholic church. before the Myan creed was decreed, and they brought many different Christians and I think.  NIAN creed. Yeah. NIC EE So this thing.  Creed of constantinople happened in like ten first canceled Nicea 325, not like a 440 451. So it happened about like five 300 to 500 years after Jesus., basically it's after the Roman Empire uh end. Yeah, but it basically transitioned into the Christian Empire, because Constantine became Christian, uh the like it was a it was a Romanonsenseinople, there's double Chchus guy where.  Oh, wow, they have it. And so what I what I started looking into right now was like what were the things that were formalized here? That uh first Council of Contents in O Roman yes, a Roman emperor was the first one to put it together.  And so they inherited a lot of the Romans ideas about power, right? Like what's his name? Um Marcus Aurelius is considered a god, okay?  This is I bought the book uh thought for myself. Yeah, he he's an interesting guy and he's a very thoughtful guy, but in in Roman like early Roman history, the kings were considered gods, right? And so this idea of hierarchy and of an authority that is more important and can control and subjugate the under length begins in the Roman Empire and then gets brought into Christianity because now that there is a an authority in Christianity, now, like all of these people said, like, this is what Christianity is.  We can't have anybody saying that Jesus was just a prophet, we can't have people like differing about these different details. We are now going to sit down and just write like this is Christianity and everyone else is wrong. And it created this uh church people god and the churches in between kind of thing.  Yeah, the clergy and um like the this hierarchy. And and yeah, so so this is what I was sort of to to do this kind of historical analysis. And there's a gap here, like I did it I think I figured out a little bit more about like the black plague and how that led to like individualism and that, you know, at some point leads to capitalism and, you know, it keeps going from there.  But before the black plague, there were the things that gave rise to the conditions that let the black plague emerge, which is congested cities, um, uh impoverished people, uh close, like condition for Yeah. So this this part I want to understand a little bit better, and I think it has something to do with the the Nican creed and this hierarchy that gets imported into Christianity that creates this like peasant landowner divide, which you can so at a seat today in terms of like hierarchical power structures. How do you uh study all this?  I mean, I knew about a lot of these pieces before. but then I started to think like of course I knew about the church. history documentaries, studies. on all the different of these things like I found a book today for the black plague. I'm going to see if I can get it. But basically like I've I've known about, you know, I read a book called Galileo's error and it's about Galileo when he first came up with his idea about the language of the world as written in mathematics, language of the University of mathematics.  He also says, but that doesn't capture quality. That is a separate thing. My whole like mathematical science approach is to focus on what I can actually define mathematically.  But there is quality, but people ignore the quality things that you say and focus on his idea that the world is describable by this systems. And so I know all of these things I have read many books in the history, but I started thinking today about the question of just making it very simple. It's like where did Oneness go?  You know, where did the sense that everything is a cohesive, holistic thing that we're a part of, go and why do we have this alienation and the sense of me versus the world? me. So that's the that's the only question and then I want to look at history through that lens, because I think, like instead of trying to go like talk about climate collapse or talk about alienation or loneliness or war or all of these things.  I think those things are effects of a mindset of alienation, a mindset of other, a mindset of not one of of many and I must protect. And so I'm trying to like go backwards, figure that out. And then what I want to do with the book is give people an experience of wait a second, not, there is quality, you know?  Like, first of all it' be like, that's where my ideas come from. You know? For me, I had this big realization one day because I grew up in a very conservative Muslim family, but uh there's actually a lot of different ways to think about with some, you know?  And in history, there's a lot. And at some point in my life I was meeting Muslims that were like very different than me, you know? They had different behaviors, they were smoking pot and still Muslim and they were comfortable with themselves.  It was like they were g marijuana. They were ganaan Rostafarianyncretic Muslims, okay? Meaning they mixed between inside?  Yeah,. And so I met these people and they were like, yeah, well, most of them Rust God. and Allah Muslim Arabic, right? And so they were like, Jah.  I'm like, whoa, how are you who you are? How? And then I was I had this moment when I was young.  I was like, how am I who I am? And then I started deconstructing where I got my religious ideas from, and its history, which was related actually weirdly enough to the British because the British mess everything up, and Saudi Arabia, and they picked this one gahhe, maybe randomly, maybe strategically, but they p so, you know, in many traditions, everything has a bell curve, everything can be put on a bell curve, right? There's extremes, and then most people are in the middle, right?  is a science bell normal curve.ussian curve. They picked the guy that was just more extreme than everyone else, you know, the guy that's like very strict and very tight and very like difficult with his interpretation, who's like music is had on and everything is had on and you know, like a very uh once make things hard, right? But even in our book theoran it says God wants ease and not hardship, but for whatever reason he skips that that thing when he reads the book, and he gave because he is so funny the history and the accidents.  Look what happens. This guy becomes the king of Saudi Arabia because he's promoted by the British, the British, you know, kind of I handed it over to him and he becomes not the king, but he he influences the king and he kind of creates the the religion of the whole country, right? The most moral looks to Saudi Arabia because it has Mecca, as like the most Mussim place in the world, right?  But what happens is not only are they they already have like Saudi Mecah and like most people think of it as the most most place in the world, they find oil in the 70s. And now they can supercharge their ideology and spread it around the world, right? So when you open up oran in the messages that I was growing up in Michigan, on the front, it says a king, a gift from the king of Saudi Arabia that they were paying for scholars to get trained in their way of thinking, and then they would fly them around the world and implant them in mosques and that's where my ideas came from.  That's where like I was taught it's called stelapism or wabism, okay? Because the guy was named Yeah. Was his name Abdalbin and Wahb?  a very uh, like you said, uh angry thoughts, uh, very strict and controlling. And it's um those people are like, uh help theirselves withorum and no, I don't I't the thing that I was trying to get to here is the interesting thing is there were two accidents that made it so that this interpretation of Isem was mine. I grew up thinking it was just true.  It was the way I understood the religion and like one I know thinks this way and taught me that this is the right way to think. um I didn't know that there was such a thing as diversity and that maybe they have different ways of thinking. I thought everyone else was wrong and we were right, okay? Until I did the exercise and I realized like, okay, the British picked Abdalele in Wahab randomly.  I don't know why they picked them, but they picked him and then, too, is that country that uh uh is now very rich and can spread its ideas around the world. And that's why I have this ideas. And so that's kind of what I want this book to do.  I want people not to just think like, oh, down with capitalism or, oh, down with the, you know, like, let's all take, uh mushrooms and be one with the universe or something and like like dress like Native Americans and live back to the land. No, like there there were different ways of seeing the world that got filtered out and blocked systematically because of historical events and how they influenced culture and philosophy, and all of these things kind of work together, you know? And I think some of those very critical ones are the hundredyear war, the thirty Year War, where most of Europe is just fighting religious wars.  If you know a little bit about history, there was a period where there was a lot of religious wars in Europe between No, religious wars between the Protestants and the Catholics and yeah. And then those those two I don't know how those influen the the thinking, though. Tuesday should be history.  And then before that, there's the black plague and how that influences thing. and before that I think it's the IN creed and how that influences things. So the Niccing creed brings this dominance hierarchy structure, the black plague brings in the individualism. And then after that we have the hundredyear award that removes uh like makes it more secular.  So it's like hierarchical individualistic, secular, scientific, and each those things has a progression. and they add up to each other, right? hierarchy and power, like individual than individual power. Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You getting it. And so, uh, but I think once people see this and then they realize like, oh, holy crap, that's why we're like this. That's why we like people talk about like Western culture What do you expect, uh, which kind of effects?  I want first this realization, this aha of like, oh, that makes sense. That's why I feel that's why we are so disconnected from nature and why people in different cultures have a different relationship. there is like a bias. Maybe there is a bias because not every people are interested in those subjects.  And then even if uh these ideas would be spread and known by everybody, do you think that most of the people would be able to understand. This is why the so that's the prep work. That prepares the mind for the next step, which is the most important step, which is to re access a natural faculty, I think everyone has and everyone knows the faculty that is activated when they sense true love, not lust, the faculty when they see nature that makes them stop in their tracks and just look in awe, right?  This this faculty that knows truth, goodness, and beauty, as, and that those three things are three things, but there are also one thing in a moment of awe, there's no words. Words are the things that take one and make it into many, and so that experience, the faculty of what I call quality, not quantity, not numbers, the quality, is non segmentable, but when you start to put words on it, you use words like beauty, truth and love. But in reality, that's one thing, okay?  And so what I want to do is get people to understand that that used to be an experience that we have, this integrated sense of a whole, this thing where, you know, the thing that in other cultures turns into people communicating with trees and animals, and even if they're going to sacrifice an animal doing it respectfully, only as much as they need, knowing their bounds because they know they're a part of a complete system that is in harmony, that there is an idea of harmony that things are inbaled, the yin and the yang I take when I can and I give when I can and like this kind of less domineering, more integrated, more relational structure emerges from all I want people to do is acknowledge that love is love and it's not so molecule. That's it. And to do that, I think we can take two steps.  One is that this perception is true and that this perception is reliable. Okay? So what what we need to do is help people distinguish between emotions and mood and a quality perception.  Does that make sense? Because some people might think like, I am falling in love. I'm feeling love.  It's like, no, just chill for a second. Wait. Is that love or is this like, excitement?  Is it lust? Is it, uh like, how do how do you know when you're feeling something that is connected to this thing that I'm talking about that is connected to the beyond to this thing that is meaningful and true in a deep way, uh and and distinguishing it from all of these fleeting emotions that go up and down and change and definitely have hormonal and biological and physiological uh can uh relationships. uh and there are people that are studying um awe, right? They're actually looking at a in like the sense of amazement, right?  In neuroscience and cognitive science, and so actually, I think my book is going to require me to do a lot of interesting research finding those researchers that are looking into these things and in in the end, I want to do a historical thing, a scientific thing, and then an experiential thing. can you go these humanity contemplation? Which one the sense of quality? I call it a faculty.  It's just like we have a faculty of hearing and seeing and smelling and tasting. We have another faculty of perception. love, goodness and truth, is the thing that, you know, you see a sunset and you just stop and like, that's amazing. Or like a waterfall or a a beautiful antelope with huge antlers in the wild, and you have this like sense of alive awe connection, reverence, you know?  Or or love is maybe more more most people, uh find it, if they have a sense of true love, like, for instance, you're holding your baby for the first time, right? And then, you know, you might ask people, okay, what happened there? What happened when I'm realizing is like, all of these things happened with an Icyon creed and the dominant structure and then the black plague and being like, I should live my life before I die or whatever.  Like all these things kind of add up to a way of being that blocks that way of seeing, that perception, that faculty that we have. It exists, though. It doesn't go anywhere.  It's like it's like we we have been walking around with one eye closed and they were like, hey, one second, just like try opening this this eye a little bit and like, what. Whoa, I can see in 3D. And that's kind of the the the metaphor that I want to say is we're seeing the world as if we have only one eye and it's flat and we don't have depth perception. It's kind of hard to tell, you know, how far things are.  But then, like once we open that second eye, we'll have depth reception and we'll know how to navigate our difficult and challenging times. It's not that we give up rational thinking or even self-protection. Like put on your seatbelt, you know, use science.  It's okay, you know, these are good things, but it needs to be put into balance with another good thing. And I would say, you know, because this is this is how I think is the right order is truth, goodness, beauty first, and science rationality to serve it. Like, should you should your head serve your heart or should your heart serve your head?  I think your head should serve your heart, you know? So this is my like thinking about it you know the same and uh I was wondering this faculty that that was more developed in the past before I see and maybe the faculty still exists in many cultures. it's meaningful. and do you think this faculty is hurt or maybe step in now This is one of the reasons why I wanted to do the research on near death experiences. A near death experiences, most of the time people come back and they make major life decisions.  Chang non-meaningful things are cut out of their life. They orient towards relationships, um, and it shows that it might take a wake-up call for people to pay more attention and realize what really matters in life, you know. And I think near that experiences do that. um But, you know, the whole planet is having a n nearative experience right now with climate collapse and all of these things.  And so many young people are considering suicide. There are, I think we talked about it last time, underage suicides, like preteenagers killing themselves, worried about the future. That is insane, okay?  Kids, like literally kids. And so the way I see it is like we are having a kind of planetary near death experience. There's a lot of stress and fear about the future.  People aren't having children and might lead to a population collapse. Like there's a lot of these issues. um and it's spilling out into the political sphere, that anxiety about things mean me first, um the France first, America first, refugees leave, you know, it's becoming more protective because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow and has all these negative consequences. And so I think, you know, talking about this and looking at like the research in near experiences and the the qu-quote solution is, I don't really want this book to be understood by everybody.  I just want to create practices that help people like connect to that perceptual faculty and acknowledges acknowledge its existence as a source of reliable and true information that is it's not like a, you know, some people talk about intuition to talk about some of these things. Like I have an intuition. I'm feeling, you know?  But it's just an idea, it's just a feeling, you know? But no, what if we distinguish between feelings and recognition? That's what I'm trying to suggest.  That we just like you recognize something with your eyes, like, this is a pencil. That's a pencil. You you can recognize something with that faculty, that perception.  Instead of saying, this is an intuition and then blowing it off as like, an emotion. an emotional as if it's not real, it'll just come and it will just go, being like, I have an intuition. Maybe I need to like dig into it and open that eye wider to get the message to get that message, right? And so it does involve some things like meditation or prayer or contemplation or just sitting with your emotions until you can see your emotions and then see beyond your emotions.  Like at some point, if you sit with your emotions, you can be like, oh, that's a feeling, it comes, and it goes, but this thing is here and it just stays. only a fancy. Yeah, we have the non-fancy version. We'll get a fancy one someday, don't worry, dear.  No, the toilet is That's right. Only one time the Japanese toilet in our parents' house. You've never really tried it.  Only one time because I was like you can change the pressure. You can make less strong. yeah, I's it's like taking a shower. It's it's less smeary. and spreading.  Yeah, yeah Arabs think of you know like people look at Arabs like dirty Arabs, Arabs look at the Western people and like, you're actually dirty, literally dirty. Definitely dirty. We were talking about this and I don't know, it's I had a family uh during my consultation on it was uh moment dad and uh the two children and uh so one were four years old and a girl was uh I think she was nine and uh they all have the gasro.  Oh no. And uh so uh I I exam then all and um I started with the little one and uh then uh the the mother and then the uh the the two of the the two others and uh at the end I was doing the prescription on the computer and the the little, the little boy, uh four years old, he was sitting on uh the legs of his. And he said mommy, I I shoot on myself oh no it's it's it went through the pens on the mother's legs.  I saw it was shit happens you took them like to the like what did you do you give them to it was only on the legs of the moment the children they went on the toilet and I gave them a tissues, yeah some tissues. four years old if he has a guest who you should wear diapers or something. Yeah. I don't know.  Yeah. So we now have both have our thesis to write. Yeah, but all these subjects are very deep and interesting and I think it's a good uh work yard you you are doing.  And it's very hard because you have to connect a lot of different things. You can have a consensus, but it's very hard to get it get to this point because people will always say that's not true we are all other influences or is just the, you know, it's just random evolution is run down and yeah, this is why one of the things I want to do is make it a a science by trying to build a community of people working on listening to that part of them that I think is a real thing. And then I don't know.  And then basically if it exists, it's gonna be in a tradition. It's gonna be in like a religious tradition or a spiritual tradition. I'm trying to say that this is like this is just something that human beings have access to.  This is why, like I don't think of myself as a Muslim because I grew up in this tradition. Like I had a very big period of exploration and questioning and wondering and it gives me also yeah, it gives me also a structure. But also, I think it's true.  Like I actually believe in the that if people were to think and explore and feel and let go over their biases and their emotions and try to understand, like, who am I? What is the world? Are we created?  Do we just as it just biological? Where do my ideas come from all of these things? That it might not look uh super Arab, uh, but like the fun the foundational principle of the most tradition is there's only one god.  And that he is not divisible, that uh he is the first and the last, and there's uh, you know, all of these like the the foundational principle is there's only one God and that the second most important thing is he doesn't leave us alone. He actually writes writes us stories and messages. I think there's only one thing, yeah.  Oh yeah, or like, uh the the Greeks, you know, with the the god of the things and, it's sort of like just questioning Yeah, they' that's actually kind of what Joe is doing these days. She's exploring the 99 names. And so there's there is only one god, but the the names are just like the Pantheon, like, there's the god of what is this?  the promoter or the advancer? the most merciful, the source of goodness, uh the avenger, uh the so so these like often come in pairs in the in the Muslim tradition, like today is uh we're reflecting on the name of God for the all seeing. One of the qualities uh Rahman.  Yeah. So this is the only Rahman only name of God that's Rahman.. So, the the way that the name works is very much like the Pathan or like Taoism, where there's often these binaries, right?  There's the first and the last, the one that honors people, the one that actually brings people to dishonor. the giver of life, the bring her to death, right? So this is still the one God, but it has these aspects. But the only one name that is ever used on its own is the most merciful. or thou god.  Which is not a description. There's either so it's either a law, which means the god or a Rahman, which means a the most merciful, and when God describes why he sent the messengers it's only to be a mercy for all of the universes. And so you get this idea that it is oneness and the primary quality of this oneness is goodness, love, beauty, truth, how everyone to talk about this all enveloping all nurturing mercy that is a the only other the only way that oneness wants to be understood in the Muslim tradition, at least.  But what I what I want to do with the book is to make it experiential, to ask people to do these practices, to reflect on what they think it means, to look at the history to understand, to to look at like one of the things that's really interesting is most indigenous cultures do have this property of oneness about it. And and being a part of a whole rather than everything is just random and there's a lot of different pieces and segmenting and cutting the world apart. It's the relational element with with everything.  And so I think that means something. I think there's something important to realize there and that Western culture is weird in the world. It's not normal.  It does spread because of the dominance and some of the different principles that cause it to be over overreaching, but to to say like, what would Western culture look like if we brought back the part of us that saw that we were part of everything else? You know? It's not that Western culture should book like native culture and have feathers in our hair or whatever.  No, like there's some really beautiful things about baguettes and berets, you know, it's great. B. B. is really wonderful things about these things, but like it's a special expression in English now? B?  No, I just made it. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay., yes. But but like what does a French culture look like when more French people you know, French people, I feel like are very cut off from religion because of the uh French revolution and because of like its own historical uh history.  But imagine if we didn't even talk about religion and we just talked about, okay, when we got rid of religion and we overemphasized like reason and rationality, we cut ourselves off from intuition, understanding, unity, wholeness, meaning, you know, things that actually make life worth living, and it's not just about eating great cheese and having affairs, you know, and sleeping around. Like there's something more and what would it look like when French culture finally opens up that eye of perception? It will be amazing.  I don't know what it could look like. I was wondering about because there is a French his name is in the one of his show is uh is speaking about French people. And the the history of uh this uh people and uh he is uh telling that uh, yeah, uh we are Gurwa.  And uh What's Gurwa is the old name for French people, because before French, France was uh gold. Oh yeah, the Ga.. and the Gauls and the Visigoths and the Goths, yeah. uh some Spanish Arabic, Italian, uh, uh immigration and the revolution and uh basically is it is kind of speaking uh fast and uh uh t this about uh, uh we don't want a president, we want uh, a piata, you know? Pinett We want something to to to break down and hit a five years we are very how people like uh as you said, uh French are totally kind of the partially related related to this idea of like when it's our responsibility now to make things better, but it's not better, we need to fight the thing that it is and try to make it better, right?  So as it's it's very much like heaven is tomorrow, you know, if we just do the right things and we make the right plan and we create this social safety nets and you know, J John, like the yellow jacket then they won't be angry because they will have their things and and so it's it's very much we need to use our reason and our logic to make life the best. and when it's not the best, we got it wrong so we have to do it again. But the problem is, you can't use that tool to understand everything and make it work. It doesn't happen, and so you keep getting frustrated, you know, because, you know, it's we mentioned, I think the idea of the strip form, you know, uh the the farm where you reduce the number of variables so that you have fertilizer water and seed and you can expect this is the expectation.  Expectation always leads to misery and suffering because you never get what you want. But when you reduce the number of variables in a system, it's more manageable to control with the with our limited human capacities, right? We are not able to reason about all of the dynamic complexities of a food forest.  What you can only do is be a part of it. You know, do your little part, you know, uh create the conditions and and have trust and faith, you know. I think Jesus said, if you trusted God as God should be trusted, you would go out like the birds, hungry in the morning and full in the evening, but every day you will leave you this is not Jesus, this is not be dead.  You you would leave the nest. in trust and reliance and hope and fear that you'll find your warm for the day, and when you find it, you can truly be joyful, you know, and that's a difference of being a part of a system and the gratitude and joy and a wiveness that is there versus I ordered the bigmac on Uri and its taking wait long. It should have been here 15 minutes ago, and I have guests coming and I paid money for this. Okay.  This expectation and this like desire, this kind of way of yeah, and and I think that's also related to why the French keep, you know, pinataing their governments. It's like you're supposed to make everything perfect. It was a good plan..  Why don't we have utopia? What happened? Because there's this arrogance to thinking that you can figure it out.  But we can figure it. I was thinking about the movie June. There is a a part when you know black guy at the he fights with a pole in one uh Paul's dream, Janice is talking to him and he he said, uh uh to understand the process of life you just have to follow it.  And you see the the sand that is a vibrating and doing waves and yeah, I like this uh but that attitude is very not accepted, especially for for governments for businesses, for the world that we're in, it's to understand life, you need to make a map and a diagram and have S do you know the SDGs are? This sustainable development goals, I think I all develop them. yougnore the SDGs. Our government is like, okay, so we have poverty and we are gonna make a pyot and this one has to be smaller and then we're can allocate more resources here and then that's going to move this one, like expand the other part of the government because the minister uh we had the first minister and the he he had he was kicked the out because uh the budget, uh with the idea of all the other uh the group the Yeah, so they they are trying to do this now. they're trying to figure figure it out.  But I wonder sometimes like what my ideas would look like if they're more balanced. Because how does the perception of quality fit into budgeting for a country? How would it look differently if it was accepted that you know, that we can't understand everything, that we have to be integrated into systems that life actually makes sense as we go through it.  Maybe instead of starting and making a budget in the beginning of the year, we do budgeting where every day we are attuned to the reality of our society as much as possible, and allocate appropriately day by day rather than you know, make a big plan or maybe that maybe that's where it needs. Maybe it needs both. Maybe it needs the pie chart and the plan in the beginning, but then every day allocating the allocating, being attuned, talking, connecting to people connecting to what is supposed to do connecting with the feeling of what you're supposed to do you know sometimes people make a good intention in the beginning, like, for instance, me and Duol lingo.  I had a good intention. I wanted to learn French, I wanted to talk with your family, I wanted to be wanted to be. But now I do duolingo just to make the streak, right?  So if I was in touch with the reality, I would either tell myself, okay, you either commit to it or just stop, because right now you're not learning French and you're just doing things to make this number go up. You know, just like people in a budget. We allocated budget to the arts because we wanted to have a flourishing creative community.  Is that doing it the best? Or is there a different way to allocate money to make sure that we have a flourishing creative community? Because there's so many people in jobs around the world, especially in governments and in the UN, where they know that this isn't the best use of funds, but this is what they're doing and they have this creeping feeling of like, this doesn't feel right.  This is wrong, but they just do it because because they don't have this, they only have this. They only have the once a year decision. integ, you know, and countries are basically uh some uh found our lending money to countries, and I think it's so complex now. I don't know how we could maybe erase all.  I mean start again and through like this watching what we are being more grounded realistic, connected to the you know, the the the thing that people kind of hope for is like, okay. We're collecting more information than we know what to do with. AI will solve it.  That's what they're thinking. They're thinking they'll just give everything to AI and it will be able to find the patterns that matter, but what I'm trying to suggest is we can't delegate this because I think that our perception of of goodness is and that feeling of like, is this right? This doesn't feel right, you know?  You can't get that. This it doesn't feel right and we need to be able to trust that. So for instance, this is one of the stories I'm put in my book.  And I think I forget his name, but this Russian general was looking at his uh monitoring system for nuclear warheads, and he saw five nuclear missiles coming from America. and he freaked out. The red light started spinning, the alarms went off, literally he was in the control room. All he had and what his job it was was to monitor this, and if America sends missiles, Russia sends missiles.  Okay. I don't know if you know about the Cold War. Yeah, so that was the Cold War.  That was the the common response to everyone was waiting for the missiles to fall, okay? And he saw the missiles. Why don't we have a story of five nucle explosions in Russia and he didn't push the button.  He didn't call his superiors. He had a feeling that said this can't be. Right.  And he trusted it. We are alive, probably. You know, like if Russia and America had a nuclear war, the world would look very, very different today.  And five nukes from America, let's imagine that they were real hitting Russia. And of course they would target major cities. Like we would live in a very different world and Russia would have anyway, it would have just exploded. and escalated.  So we're alive today and we have the world that is relatively safe without the major nuclear war because someone trusted this insight.. Yeah, it turned out that there was an error. Yeah, it was uh it was light reflecting off of a lake in New Mexico or something like that.  And so you? Yeah, and so I think that that story is like really important. uh and people need to like know about this story and to realize like this idea of creating AI plus our data to make decisions for us and without humans to be able to feel and to be close enough to reality. And this is the other thing that I'm realizing.  This is where it gets a little bit, I'm going to need to do more research on the science element, which is that guy felt something, even though the instruments which were mediated like digitally mediated instruments told him something. It was an artifact of light reflecting off of some clouds and water and yeah, like the radar systems like the I think it was a satellite system. uh But but yeah, it was an artifact that um it confused the machines. So my dad, when his brother died, felt it before he got the phone call, okay?  Many people have stories like this. Okay? And I think it's because this faculty of perception of um of oneness is one.  It's not to it's not spatially dependent. It's so that person looking at the radar had a disconnect between this faculty and this faculty. He sees the radar and it says that missiles are coming, but this thing says that they are not right?  How did that how did that thing know? That's So so this is where it gets like kind of into the place where it's like a little bit crazy, you know, where you start saying like, okay, well, you can you can perceive the right thing to do uh because it digests everything that matters about this decision and gives you a sense of it. So, and it's trustable and reliable, but it digest everything in all time and all space for this moment, you know, like relevant for this moment, but it doesn't actually matter about how far you are from the thing.  That's the kind of this is like I'm not sure if I need to go there for this argument, but that's what this story tells us. That this person had a faculty that was connected to the reality of what was happening beyond his line of sight and the instruments that were telling him what was happening were at conflict with it, but he trusted his intuitive sense or his quality sense or whatever. I think I need a better word for it.  Like I I I use the word quality, but I don't think people um I'm trying not to say things like heart and I'm trying not to say things like soul or spirit or anything that can sound religious. uh and quality in quantity or I think really good pairs of antonms, you know, it's like the quantity of things. You can measure like how far this thing is. You can measure how many, you know, silicon atoms make up this thing if you had a really it's not enough I think it may be why you try to search another word.  Do you have any ideas isn't heart? Or intuition? I'm Yeah.  And uh I was thinking about two things? The gravitation we detected a recently? Yeah, the gravitons or yeah.  The black holes that collapsed and it made waste and we could uh detected because the crazy thing is things were squished together. like isn' that crazy? Yeah. like space time squished and we got squished too, but we we didn't feel it. a very little bitters. But no, and I was thinking also about in the movie when the woman I say uh love isn't uh meatmeasurable, but it can cross space and time, you know it's interesting movies gravitational waves the kind of keep the information and it's not uh influ influenced by its base and time, you know, it' it's crossing space time.  But isn't everything crossing space time? Like right now, if you do this, you're affecting the farthest star at the end of the the universe.? Because, you know, gravity has an R squared relationship R is the distance, right?  But it never goes to zero. And so by moving my head over here, there is slightly more mass over here and the entire center of mass of the universe has shifted because I did this, right? And so it as a real effect, but that's the idea.  You can sense it if you if you are very, very very very extremely super ultrasensitive. you could sense it on the moon, you could sense it. You know, they you can actually see these experiments with gravity here where, you know, you put a bowling ball next to something and they can actually sense the amount this thing moves towards it, right? So you have a bowling ball on a string and a on a string and they actually can see it's very, very tiny amount.  But because the bowling ball has mass and it war up space time, then this thing moves, right? And so it doesn't take the graitation waves. It just takes mov, you know?  Everything is literally connected. Everything is talking to everything at all times, even just gravitational. Like I'm pulling you towards me and you're pulling me towards you right now.  Like Newton? Yeah. I'm not sure, because uh Einstein kind of uh uh you know, change everything musicfficient. money.  Newton said the third law, when two masss are there, they are it's so Einstein's idea is space time, but you are warping space time. So I concentrate space time. Yeah, a little bit.  I concentrate space time over here, which is why you feel the effect of being run. It's not necessarily like yeah, I I'm bending you a little bit towards me instead of using the Newtonian affects uh like uh never goes to zero. Yeah, yeah, to zero.  So yeah, that's the idea. So because it does affect everything at all times. Yeah, what I want to say is that, uh scientist of physicist say says that our universe is, uh um oh, there is a name an ejective to say that the physics low are the same at each point of the universe.  Self- consistence or something like that. Yeah, it's it's a very special word in French. and uh so because it it's never going to zero, but uh at our level we can't really see the the effect. But I was thinking, does does this gravitational effect could be related to the quality??  I don't know. Maybe I don't I don't I don't want to to uh explicit or to define it to try to to figure out uh what it could be related to, because uh it could it would be reduce it just like everything else. I think it no, no.ropic.  Yeah, yeah. Is. You know, sometimes this this thing we mentioned earlier, like when you are struck by something so awe inspiring, you usually don't have words, right? You're just yeah, you your reduce it to.  I yeah, I don't know. It's just How could it be meaningful and wordless? It's it's very interesting that the most meaningful things are often associated with moments of speechlessness.  And then later, a poet tries or an artist tries their best to evoke it, right in their poetry or their art, they try to put words on the unword did. truths, love, and goodness. goodness. It's it's also it's not just my uh language. This is like one of the things that um philosophers and theologians think of as kind of foundational elements of it.  There's an additional one that I use, which is beauty, but I think beauty is sort of like electricity in a solar panel, like when they' when you uh like like love and beauty come together, uh, when you love something you find a beautiful and when you find something beautiful, you love it, and so it's like the forces, right? It's it's war big space time and pulling things towards each other. That's what love does. love like takes things that are distant and tries to bring them together.  And I think that's actually a very interesting way of thinking about love as a as a force. It is actually a unifying force. Like people see each other from across the room and if they love each other, they just want to get closer and closer and closer and so they start kissing, you know.  And then they want to get inside of each other, just like become one, you know And actually, you know the weird thing is, I know it sounds very crude, but I think there's like if you look with the eye of metaphor and that nothing, well, it my interpretation, God does, is an accident, this stuff is very meaningful, like even even the sexual act as that representation of like, what does love want to do? It wants to bring things together and to take things and bring them to make one and then actually as what life comes from and like you can think about these metaphors and you can realize like, wow, man, God is hilarious, first of all. And and he's like telling a really good story here.  I'm searching a world because I have the impression that not that far. I was thinking about contemplation and Hm. Yeah, it's hot funny. good work.  You know, there's this relationship between, um love and attraction, it reminds me of one of the you know, things that the in the Muslim tradition says, like, why did God create all of this? And it goes like this. I was a this is God speaking.  He says, I was a hidden treasure that wanted to be known, and so I created so that I could be known and uh like this idea of love and knowledge is kind of evoked in this. It's like to to love and to to to to know and to be connected and um it kind of reminds me of some of the uh Indian philosophies about the Brahmin and this idea of oneness getting bored. and then hiding in multiplicity to recognize oneness and then to awaken to go back to oneness. This kind of idea uh kind of rhymes with this idea of being a hidden treasure and not being admired or known or loved, and creating in order to be able to to love and be loved. and that the and it's kind of interesting that love is the thing that takes the many and makes one.  And and it's interesting that it's actually, you know, what we just thought of historically. It's fear that takes the one makes many, right? It's the fear, the need for control, the it's so interesting.  I think love and fear are like love love is the unifying principle and fear is the the disunifying or the dispersing principle. Maybe it could be h harmony, liality harmony? Harmony, that is a result.  I think of following your perception of well, because I I asked IGPT I could be resume in one word roof, love, beauty, and goodness. You know what we can do as well, we can ask the similar question. We can ask um, can you come up with ten different ways to say quality versus quantity?  We want to find a new word for the faculty in that perceives quality. Okay. Let's see.  Let's see what it says. Depth versus breadth, substance versus substance versus scale, essent essence, versus extent, nuance versus count, value versus volume. OK, this sounds pretty good.  Meaning versus measure. Right?? Yeah, you either measure things, you know the own space and your distance or your like sense of meaning.  I like meaning quality versus quantity or meaning, and they both start with them. versus measure. That's not bad. Beauty versus bulk no.  Integrity sensna, discernment, value versus volume. That's kind of interesting. Value versus volume.  Nuance versus count. depth versus breadth. Substance awareness. Eence essence perception. essence perception.  I like the essence perception and discernment discernment and meaning can we go down this track? pisses conscience wisdom. Yeah, I mean, I think listening to it implies like that you're getting closer to wisdom.  I think like when we are listening to our lower like feelings of like fear, like jealousy or uh, you know, these like like can be addressed by tapping into the thing. It's like, okay, it's I'm feeling really angry or uh jealous, but when you listen to that faculty, how should I respond? and this is why I think the fundamental name of mercy really matters, and the fundamental like purpose of being to know and connect with a hidden treasure of like truth, beauty, and goodness is your your quality sense will never tell you like hurt someone else or hurt yourself, right?  It will never tell you yeah, I'm not so sure if the missiles are coming or not, but just fire anyway just in case you know I don't think that's going to be what happens. Usually, like the sense of meaning is also connected to self sacrifice on the opposite side of things, right? Like when we see Jesus or Gandhi or Martin Luther King Junior or pick any famous like story of someone that the band of brothers or okay, maybe not you, uh 300 uh yeah, yeah, all those people.  They lost. They all died, but they died with like honor and it left us feeling inspired, right and left us connecting to some of these qualities of years ago something it's not beautiful and the the aesthetic sense, but there's something beautiful about how they stared together and faced instrmumentable odds, and even if they died, they died with honor and there's something beautiful and good about that, right? And so it's it's something I think there's something very interesting about self-sacrifice. uh that kind of is important in this uh in this thing because it shows like the self doesn't matter.  There's like a a things a wholeness that matters more and being in harmony and in integrity and upholding what wants to come through your your your meaning sense or whatever we're calling it, you know, is more inspiring than you staying alive. But when you're in the fear, you just want to stay alive, you want to control, you want to substigate. It's like I will, I will, I will.  And like all these billionaire, you know what they're doing? They're building homes and compounds in islands around New Zealand. because they expect ocean levels a rise, New Zealand will be okay, um, they expect that this refugee mass migration thing will happen. They don't want to be on any land mass that's contiguous with other countries that are going to be experiencing climate collapse.  And they're thinking of self and self-p protection, and it's ugly, right? Like you don't you don't hear the story of like how billionaires are looking to preserve themselves. They hired a futurist named Douglas Rushkoff.  They asked him okay, we figured out the food, we figured out the land, we figured out all this stuff and we have money and we bought our place and we can survive. um and we have the people working on the farms and and all of this. How can we be sure that they won't revolt? and take over the property and like we're just one or two billionaires.  It's like a small billionaire family. How can we be sure that the personnel don't work together to kill us and just live on the island, right? And uh the the answer uh was, you know, you want, because you're a billionaire to delegate all the work.  You don't want to go and dig in the fields and figure out food and you'll kill the chickens. You want to hire people to do that. You want to pay people with food probably, right?  Because we're imagining an ap apocalyptic situation. And so what they were suggested to do was they have to do one thing and keep one thing under their control, which is food storage. They need to have the only set of keys you know, maybe biometric, maybe it's connected to their eye retina or fingerprint or something that people can't like chop off and use that needs to be connected to a very well-p protected sealed safe of food storage.  And if you do that, then you can control the rest of the situation. So I only tell that whole story. First of all, just to show you how that's ugly.  You hear that story and you're not inspired. You think this person is horrible, you don't feel like that's what we should be doing that's a good life, that's a good way of living, and we know that, but what knows that? Because it's the world Yeah, the thing that knows that, I think is that meaning sense. is that sense that says like that's not meaningful.  You might survive, but like you'll like, if you really sat with this and you didn't look at the fear that was making you do all that planning, you wouldn't be proud of yourself likely, right? I think, yeah, but just told it's kind of how our world is actually functioning. It's a real story.  It's not a hypothetical., you already told me this story of the billionaire in New Zealand. Yeah, I think it's a million people are those rich people want to try to stay in comfort and, you know and not helping people. But I was thinking about the whole stone.  It's actually how our world isn't right now, you know, the trillioners the most rich people in the world, those people are owning the industry of meat, of chemicals, and the the system, the political system and the economic system is built. so that we are like slaves working and keeping in control and the richer people, I know it sounds like communism and but uh the idea is there and it's still a bulful uh I think somebody once told me that one of the most important things that you can do for your freedom is to grow a little bit of food. It doesn't have to be everything, but just a couple of carrots, just a couple of like potatoes or onions or eggs or chicken. Once you start to realize like self sufficiency, even in a small way, like you get that feeling like, oh wow, like, because right now, I the way that I think about what you were just saying is it's sort of like these um the system as holding security and food and shelter hostage, and we have to, even though we know the system is broken, many people know this they feel like they have to go through these steps of getting a job doing these things in a certain way to be able to access the fundamental basic needs of metal hierarchy, great food, shelter, security, stuff like that.  And it's true. It's it's actually true. Like right now that's that's how the food is behind the paywall, you know?  It's interesting that they are thinking about these universal basic income and But I think about this food thing sometimes I'm like, hmm, if we owned some land somewhere and a farm that made enough food, and I looked into it. It doesn't actually take that much land and that much uh space to produce enough food for a year. Detroit I'm looking at property and So I also have like my family and my cousin's already there and yeah, it's actually really great. in terms of water excess.  It's one of the few places in the world that will benefit from climate collapse longer growing seasons, fresh water, a lot of people are weirdly enough, a lot of people this is why we should probably buy land there before too long, is people want to come to Detroit because of climate collapse. But uh yeah, other than Detroit, Russia But why would I want to go to Russia? Montes.  I thought about um Kurtisistan, also like wanna connect with roots and history and and meaning in a broader sense, right? Like what would. It's pretty fertile.  Okay, if you like mountains, there's mountains too. I am, yeah, actually, there's probably some good claiming. Kurt anymore.  Kurtan? It's I think it exists. Curtisistan never really existed in the nation stateway because the colonizers didn't realize that that was a people and they were like, well, the map should look like this, and this should be for France and that can be for England.  England, what do you think? Okay, no, no, this can be for France. They literally did that.  Do you know that? They got together. It's called the Sykes Peaks agreement.  You know about this? And they got a big map and they they drank a lot of coffee, smoked a lot of cigars and they literally drew a map. like this, and they called it putting wines in the sand, and there's some like really funny stories, like I forget, like I want to go find the thing. It's like apparently someone had their cup on the map and like somebody went a little bit like this and had to like avoid the cup and and and so you see the map of like one Yeah, you see you map with some of these countries and and it looks like and there's like this little zigzag in it and they're like, oh yeah, that was because I just didn't want to move the cup when I was, you know It's crazy.  It's it's just like when you realize like because and the rest of the world, like you look at Europe, all the borders are like this, you know? And that's people of either mountain range or that's people fighting this way and these people fighting this way. and like at some point they're like like, let's just call it a country and, you know, so let's stop fighting, you know? And you have like these very organic borders of nature and people, right?  Africa. Middle East Africa say America, like there's one states square. Yeah, but those are states in in one country, supposedly, but uh, just like the Middle East and Africa and all these places are just so so funny.  I wonder how like it's really good to be really curious, but it takes a long time for things to come together. you know? It takes a long time for things to come together. uh so well things like this this this kind of book that I'm writing, it started off because I wanted to write something about economics and I wanted to talk about like a different economic system. And then I realized that like economic systems come from like worldviews and then I wanted to like think about world views.  But because I've been such a nerd and so curious about so many things, I can actually like piece something together and was really interesting is that finally at the end, the the thing that I'm talking about is um is one thing is just one thing. It's like, and and by talking about this one thing, I can address all of the other things. I can talk about economics.  I can talk about like, why did we build this economic system? It's like, oh, because fear and need for control after, you know, the the black plague and like the council of Nicea and like hierarchy and that led to this these philosophers and history. And then in the end, it's like, I hope it's very practical.  Like I want in the end, even if the book doesn't sell, nobody cares. I want to start a coaching process that the only thing it is, it's related to have to and want to and to help people take there to do list and break it up into one of these two columns and then over time make more of their to do list on this side. That's it.  I think if we did this, what we're doing is we're getting people to connect with meaning more in their life that brings all of these other principles that we were talking about of like connecting to oneness or understanding um like their part in a broader whole because the a lot of the have toos are the I have to work to be able to eat. I have to do these things and usually they are not how you want to be, but how you think you have to be, and they usually come with tensions. They're like I have to go to work so we able to eat, but it's not happy I have to go to work usually.  It's ling this tension. And so when we do this coaching and we look at the tensions and then we ask, is it true? That's a pretty good start.  I think just doing this with more people, we can we don't have to explain all of history and where the ideas come from and we'll connect people more with their perception of meaning. It will give them more awareness of their feelings and why they have them, their anger, where they come from, you know, just by looking at your tualist and comparing half twoss and wanttos, and then asking about tensions. So this is a coaching practice that I'm developing and it's kind of comes with the book.  Wow, that's kind of cool. I think it's all because I've been working on this for a while, and initially I was working on like the economics book and then I tried to work on this philosophy book and then I worked on the the practice, but I think I have a very clear way of explaining how they all fit together. It's like there's like the understanding of the past, um how like history and philosophy evolved over time to disconnect people from oneness and then like so the core theme is this oneness principle uh and how do we get back to that?  That's I think the simplest way of explaining everything without having to get into so much detail, because there's it could be a lot of detail. I realized that I'm pretty much uh uh like, yeah, I I'm aware and I try to change to be more connected to the quality and uh the things that I want to and but I realize that I am functioning my life that I built my life and I'm functioning really much more like uh on the quantity how it works and what I have to do to get in and if you do you want to try going through the coach? Because I still have to um develop this.  I still have I only have tried running a a few times with a few people. It might be interesting to. Yeah, it could be interesting to try and it could also help you to develop it.  I'm not sure I yeah, I think I would be a good subject for for trial. But uh the thing is that maybe uh since I I passed the the 30 I uh I studied uh changing like trying to get more want to Yeah, you know, trying to to do some meditation, to to be more healthy and to yet do things that are meaningful and hmm it's still hard to do it right. Because is there right Yeah, but that's the whole uh that's is whole problem.  It's just uh I'm too much uh control. Yes. That perfection.  Yes. Yeah. That's interesting.  Well we can um we can try this like to to do this and we might not figure it out immediately, but it could be interesting to see, you know, every emotion tells you something. It's a it's an indicator of a way of being that is being blocked or prevented from uh happening. And so when you have these um feelings of like need for okay, I need to do it right, even myself development has to be right.  And you know it's all the medicine.. I think it's a big uh influence in my life. I I already I was already a bit like this before and it it went uh exacerbate exacerbate, yeah.  Yeah, with the medical students. Yeah yeah it makes sense. So it's it's like you learn these unconscious things about needing to be right Yeah, yeah, basically yeah, it's this.  I learn to, like, you know the science uh demar the method? The method It's all about uh what we we say before. the quantity, the trying to control things. Yeah. yeah.  And and you know, one of the ideas was not to have necessarily big transformations, but the idea would be to try to listen for this quiet voice, you know, this intuition, this feeling, and to answer its call, however, best you think you can, and then to reflect on was that better or worse, you know? So, for instance, like let's say, it might be a it was an interesting one. Like, when you let go of control with the barber, you didn't come in, with a picture, right?  That's a small experiment and easy one, yeah. So can we come up with more of these things and gradually build up to the bigger ones like relationships for sure. And you know what I told you about it's one big point in my life because I still feel a little a little bit guilty, uh with uh whether I I have done to her. with the history of the pregnancy and the abortion and uh and the whole all the um the very uh conflictual relationship before and after this event and uh yeah, and kind of uh always uh um questioning myself uh, either I uh school or uh did I school at all?  Did I uh h do uh bad things uh uh should I have uh uh cultivate more on this relationship uh was she uh the woman of my life uh does the the the entuition I I had before and now, uh what does that mean? Am I uh uh am I right? uh I don't know.  It's a lot of a lot of thoughts. So, uh, you know, coming from from my perspective, there is this uh this idea, especially for people that are on the path. You know, there might not be perfect, but they're on the path that when they die, they will look back, they will give you know they say life flashes before your eyes when you die?  That people on the path will look back and they look at their life and see everything that happened and not want a single thing to be changed. But that's for, I think, especially for people that are on the path that started on the path and then sustained on the path. um throughout their life. Whenever they started, it doesn't have to be starting uh, you know, from the beginning, like from birth.  But it could be that you, you know, there's this idea of uh penance and repentance and going to the confessionary or whatever it is in the Catholic Church. But this idea of like, if you have this intuition that you've done something that you aren't proud of, uh, one is it's in the past, but just make a commitment that you won't do that again, that you've learned your lesson. That's why we do bad things.  You know, there's a saying in the lesson tradition. If you lived and never made any mistakes, God would replace you with another society that made mistakes and asked for forgiveness so that he can forgive, because he is the all forgiving, right? And so this idea of like mistakes are not a mistake.  They're actually necessary part of a process of cultivating the heart of becoming like imagine if you've never made any mistakes and you died and you you know, a lot of life is about Catharsis. It's about like okay, that happened, but this time I'm gonna do a differently and then regular and then being you can be proud of yourself for doing it differently. You know, like, I had a similar thing in my life when I had a previous partner that, uh asked me if I love her, and I was like, I define love. like bring me a diction.  I literally ask for a dictionary, okay? I was like, I don't want to say anything is not true. Like, what does love mean?  you know, and because I couldn't acknowledge it because it would require me to fight my family and like, there was a lot of, you know, difficulties around this. And so I for a long time, I felt like, oh my God, I lost the person that I loved. I many thoughts similar to yours, right?  But uh, because there is one important point, uh, you you said here is when one partner is more in love than the other, and Inez was totally in love and she was very committed and I felt like uh I was uh hurting him her and I was uh uh evil and uh and uh yeah, I felt it really bad, you know, really guilty and bad, like sad. And uh that's why I had these uh whole circus of uh getting back with her, uh stopping and then getting back but you weren't sure what to do and then when you were in it didn't feel right. 20 times and uh yeah, that's why I asked myself, do I really love her, but I was not enough material to trust myself to trust my feelings? or was that not a good relationship and and I should uh just uh trust my uh what I felt and and stop it and not come back.  I remember this idea that we said that the faculty of meaning intuition and it's hard for me to trust my intuition because I have a lot of intritions and sometimes I was like, yeah, it's it's hers and sometimes I was like, knowing it can work because we are two different and so, you know, it's even now it's still hard to really be sure. So so and I think now things are really too much uh uh painful and then it's it's it's it's over. It's too it's it's screws. everything else too distant Yeah, but everything is damaged. and it's's damaged forever.  Yeah. I mean let's go back. What was that that message I was gonna say?  It was like is it true, first of all, uh the thing that okay, two things. One is there is probably a process of view that you can get clarity on, which is I know that people don't like this idea of sin, but you mentioned it yourself like, and was I evil, right? Like, what are the things that you want Sin, right?  There's uh doing bad, right? Uh, but you don't we don't usually talk about these things or even say like I was a bad person or I did something bad, but we sometimes do things against ourselves, against our own better judgment, against what we think is beautiful or right, like sometimes we are the billionaires building things and and so maybe like one of the things that you can just get clear on is what are the what like what are the waves that I was that I don't want to ever be again? One, you know, I don't want to do XY or Z or I don't want to respond like however it was, right?  With um with avoidance and distancing saying, I don't want to, you know, and and then just like ask for forgiveness and forgive yourself, and then never do them again, you know? And instead of being clear, like was I evil or was I like was I? It just be clear for you.  It doesn't have to share with anybody. I just like decide, like these are the ways that I want to be and these are the ways I don't want to be. So instead of the lessons being a little blurry, make the lessons very clear, you know, make it very clear, and then I feel like you need some kind of very it feels like a decision should be completely closed and what you can do is say, you know, that relationship is done.  I'm going to take these lessons. I know who I want to be now. I know how I want to be in relationships. um you know, it could have been a beautiful relationship.  I don't think there's only one size fits all for relationships. I think the opportunities for loving there is this idea of oneness we talked about. And it's one of the things that I told myself is like, everyone has a heart and a and a soul that's worth loving.  It's coming from the one and it's in a lot of different people's bodies, right? If I allow myself, if somebody is like, I'm willing, why would I say no? Why don't I also try to be willing, right?  What can I do to help open that door, right? And and I had like the intuition and so we cultivated and we work on like developing a love relationship. It's not this idea of like she was in love or I wasn't in love.  It's just an opportunity for someone to open the door to their spirit was available to you, and you missed it, but everyone has a spirit. Every one you might find that opportunity you likely will find that opportunity again. right? Because I feel like when you just said, I missed it.  I feel like it. And I feel like uh there is the only one, the, you know, the the the love of my life, the only one, and and he's gone and it's over. No, no.  I don't I don't think that at all. I think I think basically like I mentioned, the way that I feel is that you can love it's. If somebody is opening their heart, like, I'm willing, and you're like, okay, well, am I willing?  And like I said, mentioned last week, it was like arranged marriages, you don't need arrange marriages. It's good to have practical things too. It's good to have um compatibility things too.  It's good to have sexual attraction, it's good to have all these other things. But then if someone's like yeah, like, I'm willing.. You willing.  Maybe it could be good, you know, like, I had these it's a feeling that I missed it. And there is one up there is nobody else, but uh but it's just a feeling and I feel like you and I uh I know that it's not true, but uh this is why I think live with this film. I think it's connected to the the regret and the remorse.  Right? So there's like this this um what is that? self-fl flagellation?  because I was bad explore this idea, you know it's it's kind of weird, but I have this masochistic, this note on my uh on my iPhone, which is called the C. Is it like understanding yourself? Yeah, yeah.  Like problems to analyze and uh some kind of introspection to try to find out and figuring out what's not working, what went bad, and uh I have this this idea of uh self uhician. I think this is why I was talking about accepting the lessons, digesting them and committing to never doing them again, asking forgiveness from you from God from whomever, from you as even maybe, it might be very cathartic to ask for forgiveness, if you can not ask to get back together, but just tell her, like, whatever it is, okay? Just ask for forgiveness. like's like I come and I ask for a forgiveness as if I wanted to to to feel better, you know?  Then do it for yourself, but what I'm what I'm seeing is if you don't forgive yourself here, you might maintain this potential I lost a love of my life and I'm never going to have this like again, uh kind of feeling, but I had some intritions that uh indicate indicated in indicated mirror that uh could be could be? Okay. The the idea of the one person is is interesting to to look into uh there there may be something about like some compatible people, but what does it mean for someone to be the one?  Where does that idea come from? versus there's many people and you know how many people find the one that are high school sweethearts, you know, they met in in college or whatever you want to call it. They fell in love.  They got married, and then they get a divorce, okay? Like, there life is hard and long and lots of things change. And there's many examples of this whole like I think that movies and culture shapes are understanding a lot of relationships.  And doing this whole movie historical analysis of like where do my ideas of love come from for yourself? uh, could be interesting. parents, movies. Yeah.  And and these stories but then also looking at it with the lens of like facts, right? Like you know, like even just this idea of what does falling in love mean? This is why I give you that book, because, you know, like there is there's and relationships and compatibility and all of these things that we're we're trying to navigate and is like living together, you know, like there's just people that they might love each other, but they have very incompatible lifestyles or whatever and and this is why I think like having this maybe the both eyes thing, like the pie chart and the uh feeling, it's like, okay, this does this make sense?  Is that person willing to gradually open their heart to me? And am I willing to do that with them and making love a process? And of course, like there could be a moment of intuition.  There could be a moment of like expansion and excitement and enthusiasm. But that just opens the door to the process. This is the thing.  I think people think that you fall in love and then that's it. Instead of viewing relationships as a craft, you know? And I think you have more of a discoverer than a craft perspective and it could be balanced a little bit more with the craft. to to fabricate to make to evolve to build together craft. craft is more like actually craft is the perfect balance between quantity and quality. because exactly. the potter making the pot, right?  It has a weight, it has specifics, they want to use the right amount of water with the right amount of clay, they measured, they mixed, right? But then when they get down to actually shaping it, it's still very precise ashemisymmmetric, but they are doing both the measurements and the feeling and the quality and the perception all at the same time. It's like You know?  And that's why I think craft is a great analogy and actually this is the analogy that I use for um how I want to do my uh my my programs and and um my trainings is to view it more of like a craft uh and putting things together with both your quality and your quantity at the same time. And of course, I'm just probably reinventing Taoism or something, but uh you know, they call it cho Have you heard of choiceless action? Wui?  Choiceless action? Yeah, it's called woo. It's, you know, you might hear it from what's his name?  uh, Bruce Lee, it's like acting without acting. Like, you're not thinking about punching, like a punch happens and it happens through you, and it's like a it's when you're in that space where maybe you could think of what way is what people do when they're in the zone, right? Where let's say that you're watching an Olympic athlete do a very complicated thing.  I don't think they're thinking about all the different steps because they've become the steps. and it's like an action that happens through them of them, and it's like craft of themselves in their bodies and whatever it is, right? Yeah. So it's called wui.  It's a Chinese like Taoist principle of it's called a choiceless action. as a one way of interpreting it. It was it would be like factories and industry and the opposite side, you have arts and in between craft. Yeah.  I think so. I think that's like a good description uh and I think though, like art and craft used to be more together. And then because of you know it's like when things get more extreme, uh there has to become a middle. you know, like Yeah, it's like here's and then like art yeah, and art just becomes weirder and weirder and less and less like yeah and then here's like industry and industry is just like getting super brutalist.  Everything is minimalist and art becomes like illegible and and kind of nonsense and what's the what that boyfriend that was making sound art when one of your cousins was dating this very tattooed guy and it doesn't matter. Well, you understand like this, so art art gets weird, okay? He he was dating one of your cousins, I think.  He's a nice guy. We saw him at some family reunions when we went to Bootzeg and saw your aunt. your grand.. Do you remember it?  Yeah So he's like moving our like way out I forget. He was a nice guy, okay? But like our life.  Yeah, it was out there. But like like you know when you go down to Mar Bell or lead and you walk by um some of these older houses and you just see like the tile work or the bricks and how they were made and like artisanship and art and practical life and uh artistic life weren't so disconnected. They were actually more harmonious.  And it was it's really beautiful to like think and then we go into modern buildings and modern life and it's an it's so funny. It's like um it's like oatmeal that you didn't mix, okay? You have the bland wall that's flats and modern and whatever, and then they hang a painting of some like really abstract art, you know, and it's it's like you have the industry of the building and the the weird art that moved all the way out this way, and then they try to mix it, but like in the middle is craft, you know, and it's you don't need to hang a you know, of course there's a lot of art in a church already, but like it's integrated into the building.  It's the windows. It's not a painting on a flat wall with like minimalist aluminum siding, you know? It's kind of interesting that there's this it's like what the balance, but they balance it by putting to extreme side by side instead of instead of like oil.s very interesting.  But this is what I think an artistic sensibility might be one of the ways that we can describe this, is the thing that we're trying to to activate here in the quality. If we talk about quality, if we talk about meaning, we talk about all this stuff. Like people might not relate.  But if we talk about like developing an artistic sensibility, you know, like to just see things more with like sense and meaning and metaphor and creativity and beauty and arts and stuff. That's hard to do for people that are not trained or not or in the opposite uh condition. And that they get trained to be more and more rational rational. oh yeah, you can't even tell a story.  What can we do this could be an interesting that's true. That's that's the problem. And it's hard when you realize it even when you realize it you try to say?  Yeah, try to it it's hard because you don't have a um I used to to read the books and how it works and uh the the The structure in the instruction, you. And so I don't have instructions to try to, yeah, andalyze my previous relationship, you know how to not uh know if it was wrong or good or yeah. Did you have this sense of quality?  Yeah. I think you might have already done it you keep a journal, like just a journal. That isn't about your patience.  Yeah. I not my patience, but uh uh my patients yes, but not me. So I think there is like good ways and not so good ways to do journaling.  I think, you know, I used to journal a lot um and one of the ways actually, maybe the next book I should give you is this one. It's called the artist's Way. and the key practice in the artist way is ad journaling, but it's in a very specific way. It's you start writing and you're not allowed to stop writing until you fill three pages, okay?  You're not allowed to stop or slow down, you're supposed to just start writing, and even if you don't know what to say, you could fill a whole page with I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, I don't know what and it's totally fine. But it's called freewriting, okay? And once you do that.  And you trying to figure out what I shouldn't. But but usually, like you say like, okay, so today is Thursday, I'm just waking up. I feel a little tired.  I'm not sure what to write, but I'm gonna try. I'm doing this artist way thing. It's kind of interesting.  I'm not really sure if I'm can be creative. is like it really what what is creativity? Well, I guess I'm writing right now. Isn't that creative?  you know, like, you start with nonsense and then by the end, you'll see like it starts coming together. But you're not supposed to read it. You're supposed to take it, put it in an envelope and seal it for at least six months, okay?  The whole point is not to judge yourself, uh, to not think that it's important or that it's not important. The whole point is to turn on the engine of creativity. Just by writing three pages and not looking.  The rest of the book is is expanding on that, uh basic thing, um including how do you get artistic inspiration? And she recommends going on an artist date. So like, what's the place that is inspiring for you could be going to the mountains or the beach or a museum or a concert, whatever it is, like, what is something that actually charges you, creatively and inspiring you and do the morning pages, which is the journaling thing.  That's it. You don't need to read the book now, like, you're good. There's a lot of practices, there's a lot of things to do, but uh like week one, yeah, there's a whole process.  You know, maybe I should do that. I think it will. I can take it.  You need it? I'm thinking about doing it. Okay. you know missing?  Yeah, I've done done the process before. but I've been wondering what my craft is, you know, like we talk about being an artisan. and I think that is important for any human to have their job, to have their life, to have their family, but to have a craft. But what is it? Is it baking bread?  Is it writing books? Is it? I guess I do a lot of my craft, but like Yeah, I guess part of me is is between this half two and one two.  Like there's there's stuff that that wants to happen through me, right? uh foraging, you know, um that just happens. I'm like, wow, I'm foraging.  I love it. It's just, you know, like I walk with a baby foraging, looking for mushrooms. Oh yeah.  Okay, so foraging is on I want to. it's not even like I want to. It's like emerges, right? And then I have to like sometimes I wish I could draw better, you know, like I want to draw more.  I and but I I don't find the flow and the I'm not sure. So there's like there's something over here about drawing, you know, when I think about like my creativity. Like I want to like draw.  I want to make um stencils. And uh yeah, I guess I'm kind of doubting my craft because I don't know why I don't you know, I feel like a craft is a very personal thing and it has identity tied into it. And I identify more as somebody who, I guess writes poetry or or does drawing than as someone who's a baker.  But maybe I could change my mind about myself. I don't know. That's kind of craft on poetry and drawing..  Yeah. What what would you think is your craft that could be what could it be? in craft.  Yeah, like what is your artisal thing that brings quality and quantity? I think music, music, making or listening? Making, but it's uh like if I if I would uh do something.  Yeah, music. you play piano? You're pretty good. you know. Yeah.  I'm I think I will never do this because okay. Yeah, it's okay. But uh yeah, I that something I could uh like to to craft.  I think, you know, touching it at least once a week, bringing it into your life and and feelings and feeling what you feel. You know I, uh um practice uh uh um piano lessons when I uh finished my residence because I have time down and I was thinking about uh uh following piano lessons. You know, do you have a piano that you can play at home?  Like a keyboard or's house, but Yeah. Because I feel like one of the interesting things to explore for you is how you can explore doing it with feeling more than doing it right. And my intuition is to explore the idea of improvisation.  You know what I mean? It's just like a feeling or like a guess from me to say like you looking for a teacher when you already have some technical skills, like you know how to move around, you know how to play pieces. um but this idea that we're we're looking for is the feeling side, right? You can even you can turn piano into a quantity all of it, right?  You can. You can make it about getting it right, getting it perfect, getting it, you know, and you can force yourself and you could have the hierarchy, and you could have the power, you can you know, or you can try to figure out like what helps you feel in that moment. A along with the technical, along with the rights and along you know, like you have to stay in the scale, you know, and jazz is about like doing that, but then breaking it sometimes and coming back and then learning how to how to flow, right?  It might be an interesting thing for you to explore, like what is improvisation or just feeling mean for you in music. Yeah. Yeah, but uh improvisition I think I would do just uhap you know Yeah, that's fine.  No one's listening at least, you know. We'll get you a in the piano example, uh to for me to to try to to feel the more an emotion and try to do something like uh improvisation and uh and I wanted to be still ammonious, but uh can be because I'm not uh uh neither uh thing uh emotions that I can translate into uh movements and doing a not. So we can play so this is doing advice And now he's doing this?  He's actually playing the key. And on the opposite way doing a harm many technical There's a a band okay, so two things. One is, I think it might be interesting for you to try to bring your meditation and your piano in at the same time. like we talk about like and make themgistic.  Um, you can you're only allowed two keys, okay? middle finger thumb, okay? And then you get into your meditation and just play the two keys..  Yeah. I can also already imagine it right now, you know, like so I feel like maybe there's something there, maybe three keys. I don't know, like you but limit yourself, don't think about technicality, don't think about harmony, don't think about anything.  And there's this band that's calledawn of Mid. um, which has a uh album called disnomia. Let me see if we can find it on YouTube. Yeah, here, this is the full album.  I'll just share it with you.]]]\n\nChatGPT\nReasoned about historical context and personal transformation for a couple of seconds\nBelow is a concise look at where the historical analysis might fit in the broader framework you’re envisioning, plus some pros and cons for making it a standalone book vs. weaving it into a single volume. I’ve also thrown in a few title/subtitle ideas if you do decide on separate books or separate sections.\n1. Why Include Historical Analysis at All?\n\nBig Picture Context: Understanding how we arrived at our current worldview (individualism, alienation, scientism) grounds the argument that other ways of seeing are possible.\nDe-Normalizing the Present: Showing that modern assumptions (e.g., competition as default, “progress” as relentless growth) came from specific historical events and are not universal truths.\nUnlocking Curiosity: Many readers, once they sense we’re in a crisis of meaning, want proof it wasn’t always like this—and get excited by real historical twists, like how the Black Plague influenced capitalism or how the Nicene Creed impacted power structures.\n2. Pros & Cons: A Standalone “History” Book vs. Integrated Chapters\n\nOption A: Standalone Historical Companion Book\nWhat It Looks Like\nBook One: “Where Oneness Went: A Brief History of How We Lost Our Sense of Wholeness.”\nBook Two: “Come Alive: Reclaiming the Forgotten Faculty of Meaning (in Work & Life).”\nPros\nDeep Dive: You can go far into the weeds—Council of Nicaea, Black Plague, the Reformation, Enlightenment scientism, the Saudi-British story, etc.—without worrying about bogging down a more practical/spiritual text.\nScholarly Appeal: Readers who love history and philosophy will devour this dedicated volume.\nClear Focus: Each book has its own mission—one about how we got here historically, one about how to change now.\nCons\nPotential Overload: You risk losing momentum and immediate applicability if the history is too separate from the “how to live” message.\nDelayed Payoff: Readers might feel “I have to read a whole other book before I get to the practical transformations.”\nExtra Writing Overhead: You create two fully fleshed-out books, which can be taxing unless you genuinely want a distinct “history deep dive” audience.\nOption B: Integrated Historical Chapters or Sections\nWhat It Looks Like\nA single book—“Come Alive: Rediscovering Our Lost Sense of Wholeness”—with one major section that uses historical highlights to explain how oneness got eclipsed by hierarchy, competition, and secular rationality.\nPros\nUnified Narrative: Readers see the through-line from ancient/medieval shifts straight into today’s crisis—and then into today’s solutions.\nMore Story-Driven: The historical parts can become “origin stories,” giving emotional resonance to the later advice or spiritual perspectives.\nAccessible Size: A single, cohesive volume often feels more approachable than a separate “history tome.”\nCons\nLength & Density: If you go deep, you risk half the book becoming a historical treatise, which may alienate casual readers looking for practical guidance.\nBalancing Act: You must carefully braid historical context with the “aliveness” or “meaning faculty” message so it doesn’t read like two unrelated books.\nLoss of Scholarly Depth: You may have to trim down historical complexities to keep the pace moving.\n3. Sample Approaches to Integrating History\n\nApproach 1: Part I – “How We Got Here”\n3–4 concise chapters summarizing major eras: Nicene Creed & hierarchy, the Black Plague & individualism, religious wars & secularism, Enlightenment & scientism.\nKeep it narrative, focusing on key turning points that fed the alienation worldview.\nThen pivot to “Now we see how the West got weird—so let’s see how to un-weird it.”\nApproach 2: “Historical Interludes”\nWeave history throughout the book in short, 3–5-page “interlude” segments at the end (or beginning) of each part.\nEach interlude highlights a single historical shift (e.g., “The Black Plague & the Birth of Competitive Survival”) to contextualize the next chapter’s theme (e.g., “How Fear Distances Us from Oneness”).\nApproach 3: Spotlight Case Studies\nThroughout the main text, sidebars or breakout boxes briefly recount crucial historical anecdotes (e.g., Galileo’s Error, the Council of Nicaea, Wahhabism & British support, etc.).\nThese boxes function like “mini-history lessons” that enrich your broader message—without requiring a dedicated “History of Everything” chunk.\n4. Title Ideas if You Do Split Off the History\n\n“Where Oneness Went”\nSubtitle: “A Brief History of How We Lost Our Sense of Wholeness—And Why It Matters Now.”\n“From Hierarchy to Hedonism”\nSubtitle: “Tracing Europe’s Religious Power Struggles & the Rise of Individualism.”\n“A World Unraveling”\nSubtitle: “Key Moments that Shaped Modern Disconnection—and How to Stitch Wholeness Back Together.”\nThen your main “Come Alive”-style book references that historical volume as needed.\n5. Recommendations Based on Your Goals\n\nIf You Love Diving into History & Don’t Want To Sacrifice Depth:\nWrite a separate smaller historical companion. Let it be more scholarly or thorough. In your main “Come Alive” book, you offer summarized highlights and refer to the companion for those who want the deeper dive.\nIf You Prefer One Book That Seamlessly Blends Context & Practice:\nIntegrate the history as a Part I or as “Interludes” so that your core thesis—“Reclaiming Our Forgotten Perception of Wholeness”—remains central. Limit the history to the essential turning points that directly explain the contemporary crisis of alienation.\nIf Your Heart Says “I Must Tell the Full Story, But I Don’t Want to Lose Readers”:\nConsider Approach 3 with short, punchy historical spotlights. You don’t have to bury your amazing research—just present it in digestible sidebars or essays within the main flow, so the grand narrative never drags.\n6. “Come Alive (at Work)” vs. A Purely “Barakanomics” Angle\n\n“Come Alive” is broader: it’s about a universal re-awakening of this meaning faculty in every sphere—relationships, personal growth, spirituality, and yes, business/economics.\nPro: Wider appeal, not pigeonholed as an economics book.\nCon: Might be so broad that readers looking for a direct focus (e.g., “How to bring meaning into business”) could feel it’s a bit diffuse.\n“Barakanomics / The Relational Economy” is more narrowly about economic life and how meaning/spiritual wholeness can reshape it.\nPro: Clear niche; stands out in “alternative economics” category.\nCon: Could imply it’s only about commerce, ignoring the personal/spiritual dimension you love.\nPossible Middle Ground:\n“Come Alive at Work: How Reconnecting with Our Forgotten Faculty of Meaning Transforms Business, Economics, and Life.”\nYou’d still have the personal dimension (and a bit of spiritual/historical analysis), but anchor it in the workplace and economic structures.\n7. Final Thoughts & Suggestions\n\nDeciding Factors:\nYour Own Energy: Do you love writing deep historical analysis, or does it start to feel like a chore?\nYour Audience: Do you foresee readers who want the big historical detail, or do they mostly want the “shift my worldview now” approach?\nYour Timeline: Writing two books vs. integrating into one is a big difference in scope.\nHybrid Strategy:\nWrite one “Come Alive” book that includes a 60–80 page Part I (or interwoven interludes) capturing the key historical leaps—just enough to illuminate why and how we became alienated.\nIf the historical research truly overflows, spin it into a follow-up or extended companion once you see if readers crave more details.\nIn short: The historical analysis can be powerful, but it doesn’t have to bury the main message. Give it enough space to ground the reader in “This didn’t all come from nowhere,” but let the heart of the book be your call to awaken the faculty of meaning/quality/essence—because that’s what you seem most energized to share."

The Original Unity: Pre-Nicene Christianity and diverse interpretations\n2. The First Split: Council of Nicaea and the birth of hierarchy\n3. The Black Death: From community to individual survival\n4. Descartes and the Mechanistic Universe\n5. The Rise of Capitalism as Symptom\n\n### Part II: The Modern Crisis\n1. Signs of Disconnection: Climate anxiety, youth suicide, political polarization\n2. The Limitations of Pure Materialism\n3. Quality vs. Quantity: Two Ways of Knowing\n4. Case Study: Near-Death Experiences and Awakening\n\n### Part III: Reclaiming Wholeness\n1. The Faculty of Meaning: Beyond Emotion and Reason\n2. Practices for Reconnection\n3. Applications in Daily Life\n4. A New Economics of Meaning\n\n---\n\n## Structure 2: The Two Faculties\n*Theme: Contrasting and integrating our two fundamental ways of knowing*\n\n### Part I: Two Ways of Seeing\n1. The Quantitative Mind: Measurement, Analysis, Control\n2. The Qualitative Faculty: Direct Perception of Meaning\n3. The False Dichotomy\n4. Case Studies in Integration (e.g., Craft traditions, Indigenous knowledge)\n\n### Part II: How We Lost Balance\n1. Historical Forces (Nicene Creed, Black Death, Scientific Revolution)\n2. Modern Symptoms\n3. The Hidden Costs of Imbalance\n\n### Part III: Restoring Balance\n1. Recognition vs. Emotion\n2. Practices for Cultivation\n3. Applications:\n   - Personal Life\n   - Relationships\n   - Work\n   - Economics\n   - Environmental Crisis\n4. Integration: The Path Forward\n\n---\n\n## Structure 3: The Recognition Revolution\n*Theme: Building from personal experience to societal transformation*\n\n### Part I: The Experience of Meaning\n1. Opening: The Russian Officer Story (trusting meaning over instruments)\n2. Moments of Recognition: Love, Beauty, Truth\n3. Beyond Emotion: The Faculty of Direct Knowing\n4. The Scientific Evidence: Research on Awe, Near-Death Experiences\n\n### Part II: The Great Forgetting\n1. Historical Context: How We Lost Our Way\n2. Modern Materialism and Its Limits\n3. The False Promise of Pure Rationality\n4. Capitalism as Symptom, Not Cause\n\n### Part III: Personal Awakening\n1. Distinguishing Quality from Quantity\n2. Practices for Cultivation\n3. Integration with Daily Life\n4. The Have-To vs. Want-To Framework\n\n### Part IV: Societal Transformation\n1. Economics Reimagined\n2. Education Reformed\n3. Politics Renewed\n4. Environmental Connection Restored\n5. Conclusion: A New Way Forward\n\n---\n\n## Analysis and Recommendation\n\n### Structure 1 Strengths\n- Clear historical narrative\n- Shows how we got here\n- Strong foundation for understanding current crisis\n\n### Structure 1 Weaknesses\n- May feel too academic initially\n- Delays personal application\n- Could lose readers seeking immediate relevance\n\n### Structure 2 Strengths\n- Clear conceptual framework\n- Balanced approach\n- Practical applications throughout\n\n### Structure 2 Weaknesses\n- More abstract\n- Could feel too theoretical\n- Historical context less prominent\n\n### Structure 3 Strengths\n- Begins with compelling personal experience\n- Builds naturally from individual to societal\n- Integrates theory and practice\n- Maintains engagement through narrative\n- Ends with concrete applications\n- Balances personal and societal transformation\n\n### Structure 3 Weaknesses\n- More complex structure\n- Requires careful transitions\n- Could feel ambitious in scope\n\n### Recommendation\n\nStructure 3 (\"The Recognition Revolution\") appears most promising because it:\n\n1. Starts with compelling personal experiences readers can relate to\n2. Builds naturally from individual to societal implications\n3. Integrates historical analysis without letting it dominate\n4. Maintains practical relevance throughout\n5. Ends with concrete applications and hope\n6. Balances personal transformation with systemic change\n\nThis structure also aligns well with your goal of showing that meaning isn't merely emergent from material reality, while maintaining accessibility for general readers. The Russian Officer story makes an excellent opening as it immediately demonstrates the reality and reliability of the meaning faculty in a high-stakes situation.\n\nThe progression from personal experience to societal transformation feels natural and compelling, while the historical analysis in Part II provides necessary context without overwhelming the narrative. This structure also allows for the integration of your coaching framework (Have-To vs. Want-To) in a way that feels earned rather than prescribed.",

The Recognition Question\n\"What if our deepest knowing isn't thought or emotion, but recognition?\"\n\n### Why This Works\n- Immediately challenges the emotion/reason dichotomy\n- Introduces the concept of direct perception/recognition\n- Resonates with personal experience\n- Opens space for exploring the faculty of meaning\n\n### Potential Drawbacks\n- Might feel too abstract initially\n- Could need more concrete grounding\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Lost Faculty Question\n\"How did we forget we have two eyes - one for quantity and one for quality - and what awakens when we open both?\"\n\n### Why This Works\n- Uses your powerful metaphor of depth perception\n- Suggests both loss and potential recovery\n- Implies natural balance rather than opposition\n- Links to practical experience\n\n### Potential Drawbacks\n- Metaphor might need unpacking\n- Could seem too poetic for some readers\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Integration Question\n\"What becomes possible when we trust both our ability to measure and our capacity to mean?\"\n\n### Why This Works\n- Bridges the apparent divide\n- Suggests practical applications\n- Points toward synthesis rather than conflict\n- Opens up exploration of possibilities\n\n### Potential Drawbacks\n- Might seem too reconciliatory\n- Could underplay the depth of the crisis\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Historical Question\n\"How did we transform from a civilization that saw meaning everywhere into one that sees it nowhere?\"\n\n### Why This Works\n- Sets up historical exploration\n- Highlights the scale of transformation\n- Suggests both loss and potential recovery\n- Connects to current crisis\n\n### Potential Drawbacks\n- Might romanticize the past\n- Could feel too academic\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Crisis Question\n\"Why do we feel increasingly empty despite having more than ever before?\"\n\n### Why This Works\n- Immediately relevant to readers\n- Connects personal experience to broader patterns\n- Opens exploration of materialism's limits\n- Points toward deeper solutions\n\n### Potential Drawbacks\n- Could seem too focused on problems\n- Might need more emphasis on solutions\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Craft Question\n\"What if meaning isn't found or made, but recognized through craft?\"\n\n### Why This Works\n- Links to practical experience\n- Suggests active engagement\n- Bridges theory and practice\n- Opens up discussion of quality\n\n### Potential Drawbacks\n- Might seem too narrow initially\n- Could need more explicit connection to broader themes\n\n---\n\n## 7. The Awakening Question\n\"What if our global crisis isn't a breakdown but an awakening?\"\n\n### Why This Works\n- Reframes current challenges\n- Suggests hope and possibility\n- Links personal and collective transformation\n- Opens up positive vision\n\n### Potential Drawbacks\n- Could seem too optimistic\n- Might need more grounding in reality\n\n---\n\n## 8. The Economics Question\n\"How would our economy change if we measured meaning as carefully as we measure money?\"\n\n### Why This Works\n- Connects to practical concerns\n- Challenges current paradigms\n- Suggests concrete applications\n- Opens up systemic analysis\n\n### Potential Drawbacks\n- Might seem too focused on economics\n- Could need more personal dimension\n\n---\n\n## 9. The Love Question\n\"What if love isn't an emotion but a faculty of recognition?\"\n\n### Why This Works\n- Immediately engaging\n- Connects to universal experience\n- Challenges common assumptions\n- Opens up deeper exploration\n\n### Potential Drawbacks\n- Could seem too focused on relationships\n- Might need broader application\n\n---\n\n## 10. The Intelligence Question\n\"What if our deepest intelligence isn't in our thoughts but in our recognition?\"\n\n### Why This Works\n- Challenges conventional views\n- Links to current AI/technology discussions\n- Opens up exploration of consciousness\n- Suggests practical implications\n\n### Potential Drawbacks\n- Might seem too abstract\n- Could need more concrete examples\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\nAfter analyzing these questions, I believe the most powerful guiding question is a variation of #2:\n\n**\"How did we forget we have two eyes - one for quantity and one for quality - and what becomes possible when we open both?\"**\n\nThis question works particularly well because it:\n\n1. Uses your compelling metaphor of depth perception\n2. Includes both historical analysis and future possibility\n3. Suggests practical implications\n4. Avoids false dichotomies\n5. Points toward integration rather than conflict\n6. Opens up both personal and societal dimensions\n7. Connects to concrete experience (vision/depth perception)\n8. Implies hope without minimizing challenges\n\nThe question could serve as both an explicit frame (perhaps as a subtitle) and an implicit guide for organizing the book's exploration.",

            "extracted_content": "From Metrics to Meaning: \nCrafting a Garden of Real Impact\n“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”\n—Martin Luther King Jr.\nPart I: The Moment That Changed Everything\nA few years ago, I was listening to the On Being podcast when I first encountered Father Greg Boyle’s story about Homeboy Industries—the largest gang rehabilitation program in the world. Mid-interview, someone asked Father Greg about the intentions for his work. He paused, then replied with disarming simplicity:\n“They’re my friends.”\nThat single line plunged me into a deep realization: I had been treating people—refugees, youth, marginalized communities—as a means to an end. Yes, the “end” was noble (jobs created, businesses launched, metrics hit), but the means were often confused between my own goals, funding, validation, and scale, hinged on chasing stories and big numbers rather than authentic human connections. I suddenly felt clear about why I had this gnawing notion that there was a disconnect between me and my work, between measurements and meaning.\nI moved more permanently to Lebanon, driven less by strategy and more by trusting a deeper calling: to truly know and be known by the people I wanted to help. Over the following years, I cultivated friendships with refugees, ex-shoe shiners, and folks living on the street. Where once I saw \"targets,\" I began to see humans with full stories.\nThat shift changed everything. It was a moment that upended my understanding of social impact. I'd been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for \"scaling impact\"—always with an eye on the next pilot or data set.\nI felt a shock of recognition, like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway. I realized that in pursuing \"doing good,\" I had been unconsciously adopting a worldview in which people became instruments for metrics: a new job created, a new training delivered, a new \"success\" story. But life is not a game, and people are not pawns. I was measuring and optimizing, yet I wasn't rooting. That single line—\"They're my friends\"—pierced me with its radical simplicity.\nAnd so I made a choice: rather than continuing my peripatetic rounds, I would anchor myself in fellowship. I put down deeper roots in Lebanon. This decision wasn’t “strategic” by typical standards; it didn’t promise massive scale on a graph. But it promised relationship—the kind that Father Greg spoke of. In stepping away from always “proving impact,” I rediscovered something I’d long neglected: the primacy of human connection over data.\n\nPart II: The Crisis in Social Impact\nMy journey might sound personal, but it highlights a wider crisis pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase scale and efficiency, they often instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change. Microfinance, for instance, started as a way to empower the poor but has sometimes devolved into aggressive loan sharking that leaves borrowers trapped in debt.\n“How you do anything is how you do everything” - Zen saying\nMany of the problems the social impact space attempts to address are related to a deeply rooted materialist understanding of reality. This leads us to see nature as resources to extract and humans as units of labor. It's as if we've set a goal to drive from Los Angeles to New York, but instead, we're going from Los Angeles to Portland... Except we're driving a tank, so it doesn't matter if our goals and destination are any \"better\" - SDGs versus profit maximization, for example. We're still going to tear up the road along the way.\n\"Bloom where you are planted.\" – Saint Francis de Sales\nNeoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong\nThe social impact world is rife with examples of good intentions gone awry when metrics are prioritized over people. Microfinance soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. But as the industry ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas, leading to tragic cases of borrower suicides in India. The metric—repayment rate—trumped any humane consideration for the poor.\nIn Palestine and the levant, international agencies pour resources into \"job creation\" for refugees and the marginalized, touting the number of short-term positions funded. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on people in the region are systemically downplayed, overshadowed by tidy employment statistics that ignore generational trauma.\nAcross the board, we chase faster gains, more significant numbers, and more impressive ratios. But in conversation after conversation, I hear a deep unease from our colleagues in the impact space—a sense that in our obsession with impact, we are losing touch with the messy, relational reality of social change.\n\nPart III: A Different Way of Seeing\nFather Greg's words offer a radical challenge to the mechanistic worldview that pervades much of the social impact space. Friendship resists objectification. Friendship isn’t about a goal in the future, it’s about a quality in the now. Friendship implies presence and empathy, refusing to hold a person at arm’s length while counting them in a tally.\nStereoscopic Vision: Both Eyes Open\nIn our quest to measure impact, we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose sight of the other eye—the one that perceives emotional truth, moral complexity, and the depth of human experience. Together, these two ways of seeing provide stereoscopic vision, revealing the nuances we'd otherwise flatten.\nIn our quest to measure impact, prove value, and access funds (often competitively with others in the “do good space”), we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. The one that loves seeing charts, even if they don’t mean much.\nIn doing so, we lose access to our other eye—the one that perceives intangible depth, emotional truth,and moral complexity. Together, these eyes provide stereoscopic vision, enabling depth perception. Without it, we see the world in 2D and might bump our heads or miss the mark.\nEye One (Metrics and Tools): We do need numbers. They can guide resource allocation and demonstrate accountability.\nEye Two (Meaning and Relationship): This eye sees the humanity behind the metrics. It recognizes that calling out genocide might matter as much as any job statistic. It sees that building a genuine friendship can be the difference between short-lived success and lasting transformation.\n“Without two eyes, we cannot perceive depth.”\n-Facts\n\nPart IV: Crafting a Garden — A New Metaphor for Impact\nIn my work, I’ve long resonated with two metaphors: “craft” and “gardening.” Lately, I’ve combined them into “crafting a garden,” which captures the delicate balance between artistry and cultivation—between carefully shaping something and letting nature unfold.\n1. Crafting a Garden: The Overall Idea\nWhen you craft something—like a potter shaping clay—you rely on skill, attention, and care. You have an intuitive sense of when the clay yields and how it wants to form. You measure, but you also feel. Similarly, a gardener sets the right conditions—soil fertility, water, sunshine—then watches growth emerge. You cannot force a seed to sprout; you can only support its natural flourishing.\nCrafting a garden merges these ideas: we pay reverent attention to every interaction (the “craft” side), while recognizing natural growth cycles (the “garden” side). We create conditions for transformation but do not rigidly control it.\n2. The Shortfalls of Factory Logic\nFactory Mindset: Standardize, mass-produce, aim for uniform outcomes on a big scale.\nGarden-Craft Mindset: Embrace diversity, local nuance, and the unpredictable beauty of living systems.\nToo often, social enterprises act like factories, chasing immediate wins without building the fertile soil of community trust. The result is a quick burst of external success—numbers—but no lasting root structure.\n3. Lessons from Craftsmanship\nA craftsperson understands:\nAttentiveness: The material (clay, wood, community) has its own story, and you must listen.\nTiming and Rhythm: Rushing can ruin the piece; waiting too long can spoil it, too. In social impact, a sense of readiness is as crucial as speed.\nEmbrace of Imperfection: Beautiful creations often bear the marks of real process, just like communities might have unique “flaws” that are actually sources of resilience.\nThis echoes how a gardener might wait out certain seasons, prune carefully, or trust the cycles of growth. When we treat a community like a “crafted garden,” we’re letting them keep their selfhood while offering supportive hands.\nSuccess at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact—drawing goals, setting metrics—but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not?\nThink about a food forest versus a factory farm. The factory farm is always waiting for the harvest, measuring inputs against projected outputs. But in the food forest, every moment is successful—even the decaying leaves in winter are doing exactly what they should. It isn’t waiting for the apples; it’s alive and successful in every moment.\n\nPart V: The Crisis of “Faster, Cheaper, Bigger”\nLet's face it: many funders, donors, and boards prefer a \"faster, cheaper, bigger\" approach. They want to see hundreds of houses built or thousands of jobs created—now. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma, building local leadership, or confronting injustice are harder to put in a bar chart.\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or build genuine relationships—as Father Greg does\n\nGenocide in Palestine: If we remain silent on the structural oppression, no number of short-term jobs will address the underlying violence.\nPost-Disaster Reconstruction: If we fail to partner intimately with the local population—crafting solutions together—our “efficiency” might yield broken or irrelevant structures in a year’s time.\nA gardener doesn’t force the seed to open by cracking it with a hammer. Instead, they ensure the soil is nutrient-rich, the sun and water are adequate, and the environment is supportive. Similarly, a craftsperson doesn’t just “shave wood faster”; they learn the wood’s grain to avoid splits and fractures.\nSustaining Long-Term Flourishing\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or take time to build genuine friendships—like Father Greg—we plant seeds that can sustain growth for decades. Short-term “scale mania” might yield impressive stats but can erode deeper bonds and obscure systemic oppression, as we see in Palestine, India, or countless other contexts. Quick wins might spike the graphs but erode community trust. Scale without soul is just another form of “mental colonization.”\n\nPart VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom — A Vision for Meaningful Work\nBloom can transform into being an organization that co-runs programs that aim to help people rediscover meaning in work and life. We used to focus on performance dashboards—like a factory. But now I’m proposing adopting the crafting-a-garden approach:\nPreparing the Soil (Community Readiness)\nInstead of imposing solutions, we spend time listening. We don’t just gather “user feedback.” We have conversations, learn local stories, and see what’s already happening under the surface.\nPlanting the Seeds (Inviting Co-Creation)\nWe collaborate with participants as partners. Instead of top-down “Here’s the solution,” we ask, “What do you envision?” We do not define “impact metrics” without them—we craft the shape together.\nTending the Garden (Sustained Support)\nLike a gardener who regularly checks moisture and weeds, we maintain ongoing relationships—coaching, reflection circles, genuine friendship. We honor participants’ autonomy and celebrate emergent growth.\nHarvesting and Sharing (Reflecting on Results)\nOf course we measure—numbers, surveys—but these metrics follow the meaning, not the other way around. We also gather stories, capturing the intangible transformations: self-confidence blossoming, communities forging new alliances, or entrepreneurs finding deeper alignment.\nOn the Edge of True Impact\nWhen we treat social impact as craft, we realize we can’t solve all problems overnight. But we can stand with communities in a lifelong posture of solidarity. We can name injustices rather than burying them under “neutral” data. In that naming, in that presence, we keep seeds of hope alive.\nImplications for Bloom:\nInstead of impact dashboards, focus on preparing the soil, planting the seeds of co-creation, and tending the garden through sustained support.\nReplace standardized programs with living apprenticeships that foster organic growth and transmission of wisdom.\nBuild technology to serve human connection, not replace it. Start with people, bring in tools only as the work demands.\nMeasure what matters: moments of meaning, quality of relationships, community vitality. Track transformation through storytelling and direct presence.\n\nWhat This Means for Our Work\nInstead of our current approach—dashboards, hockey stick projections, assessment tools—we could build like craftspeople:\nFrom Programs to Practice Spaces\nReplace fixed curriculum with living apprenticeship\nCreate conditions for natural emergence\nSupport direct transmission of wisdom\nLet timing follow organic development\nFrom Tools to Relationships\nBuild technology only when we truly have to\nStart with calling people, connecting them, figuring things out\nOnly add systems when the human work demands it\nLet tools serve connection, not replace it\nQuality recognition requires human presence\nLet technology serve connection, not replace it\nFocus on Depth Over Breadth\nBetter to work deeply with a few than superficially with many\nTrust that quality spreads naturally\nLet impact emerge from meaning\nMeasure What Matters\nTrack moments of real connection\nNotice where quality recognition develops\nDocument authentic transformation\nLet patterns emerge naturally\nThe future isn’t in better automation or control systems—it’s in better supporting our natural capacity to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true. Everything else follows from that.\nMaking Measurement Serve Life\nHere’s what this could look like:\nInstead of measuring:\nPlatform engagement\nGrowth projections\nImpact metrics\nResource utilization\nWe measure:\nMoments of meaning\nQuality of relationships\nWisdom transmission\nCommunity vitality\nThe key isn’t just changing what we measure, but how we measure: through direct relationship, story, observation, and community, not just data extraction.\n\nA Different Kind of Economy\nThis isn’t about rejecting markets or metrics entirely. It’s about putting them in service of life. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning. When we do this:\nQuality naturally reduces waste\nRelationship naturally builds resilience\nMeaning naturally guides growth\nBeauty naturally creates value\nWe can pioneer an economy that affirms our humanity rather than exploits it. Where craft and care matter more than extraction and scale. Where honoring the uniqueness of people and place generates abundance for all.\n\nPart VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\nA Different Way Forward\nWhy does a materialist approach lead to so many issues? Because it fundamentally doesn’t acknowledge that humans have access to goodness within them and therefore must be controlled. The world is scary, so we need more knowledge, more science, more data, more control to put it under our command is the answer, although there is much we don’t know and this statement itself is full of hubris.\n\nThe unwritten belief is that life is nasty brutish and short (Hobbes), we can only know our mind and the world is “out there”(Descartes), the out there world is described by mathematics (Galileo), evolution describes our behavior (Darwin) and it’s survival of the fittest. These understandings lead to seeing people as mechanistic objects that can be tracked, manipulated, and controlled. That those who are smart and kind need to enact systems of control that ensure we don’t have the 30 years war again, and religion is bad, BTW, so is God and spirituality and all the stuff that probably led up to all the violence. The issue is the baby we threw out with the bathwater is the thing that gives us access to intuitive knowledge(which is a form of knowledge), insight, meaning, access to quality, goodness, truth, beauty, and knowing it when we see it. It closed one of our eyes.\nWeaving it Together: The examples of Buurtzorg and Sounds True illustrate how we might live out the principles of the crafted garden in our organizations. By privileging quality over control and wisdom over sheer scale, these pioneers point toward a new paradigm—one that the social impact world desperately needs.\nGrounding the Vision: What could this look like in practice? Imagine a social enterprise that apprentices local youth in green building, teaching both technical and relational skills. They construct eco-homes not through a cookie-cutter blueprint, but by truly understanding the landscape and the community's dreams. The organization tracks not just houses built, but the confidence and leadership that blossoms in the youth. Funders receive not just data points, but rich stories of transformation. This is impact with the intimacy of a garden and the integrity of a well-crafted structure.\nI’ve had deep doubts about the social impact space, especially after reading Winners Take All and realizing that what we’re doing isn’t what we’re talking about. We’re not saving the world—we’re helping people find community, develop confidence, learn, grow, find agency. We’re not even really helping them establish financially successful exponential businesses, because we don’t embody that. We embody something that matters to many, yet we’re not clear about that. Instead, we pretend to sell other things, and that tension hurts.\nThis isn’t abstract theory—there are organizations showing a different way forward. Buurtzorg in the Netherlands eliminated all management and metrics-based control, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country. Or Sounds True, which built a $60M publishing company by trusting both business acumen and deeper wisdom, proving that spiritual values can drive real success.\nThese aren’t just nice stories—they point toward a fundamentally different way of working that honors quality recognition and craft. When I say craft, I don’t just mean artisanal products. I mean any work that:\nDevelops through direct relationship and apprenticeship\nValues mastery and depth alongside innovation\nCreates containers for meaningful work to emerge\nTrusts people’s natural capacity to recognize quality\nSo how do we shift from metrics mania to crafting a garden?\nPractice Stereoscopic Vision\nKeep your metrics if they help you see part of reality. But never lose the second eye: the moral, relational, or spiritual dimension that sees goodness, truth, beauty and possibilities for friendship.\nName Reality Clearly\nAvoid euphemisms. If it’s genocide, call it genocide. If microfinance turns exploitative, say so openly. Authentic relationships thrive on honesty, not polite obfuscation.\nSlow Down to Go Deeper\nSlowing the pace allows you to “listen to the clay,” to sense a community’s soul. Rushing might create short-term outputs but often yields shallow or harmful outcomes.\nTrust the Process of Craft\nAccept that not everything can be a linear blueprint. Gardening has seasons; some seeds fail. Craft has trial and error; sometimes the material cracks. This is growth, not a series of guaranteed leaps.\nAdopt the Gardener’s Long View\nA gardener invests in the soil, knowing real harvests may come years later—or bless future generations. In social impact, facing crises that range from genocide to climate disasters, we must hold a long-range vision. Even small acts of genuine friendship, alignment with our perception of beauty, can ripple beyond our immediate horizon.\n\nA Moment for Reflection\nWhat tension do you feel when pressured for quick results?\nWhich relationships in your work might you deepen rather than “scale”?\nWhere might you stand in truth—calling out systemic violence or injustice—rather than quietly conforming to funder-friendly narratives?\nAsking these questions is an act of reclaiming our second eye—the one that perceives depth and moral texture. It’s a necessary counterpart to the first eye of data analysis.\n\nConclusion: Trusting the Seeds, Crafting the Garden\nFather Greg Boyle’s line—“They’re my friends”—remains a beacon for me. It teaches that relationship can’t be an afterthought. No matter how refined our metrics or how lofty our proposals, if we lose sight of shared humanity, we drift into the same mechanistic mindset we intended to oppose.\nCrafting a garden of social impact means:\nTending relationships like precious seedlings.\nUsing skilled, attentive “craft” to shape solutions with communities, cultivating the context in the present moment - anticipating the “impact” in the future like a gardener planting seeds in the spring hopes for tomatoes in the summer, yet can’t ensure it.\n\n\nThis is not an easy path. Gardens demand consistent care; craft demands repeated practice and humility. But it’s the only path I’ve found that truly integrates rational analysis with moral imagination. We don’t discard numbers—we simply refuse to make them our God. Instead, we combine metrics with love, data with empathy, and structure with spirit. That is the heart of stereoscopic vision—two ways of seeing that yield a deeper perception of reality.\nIn the end, what we grow—in ourselves and our communities—may far surpass the limited ambitions of simple “outputs” and “outcomes.” We may witness genuine healing, solidarity, and creative flourishing where once only a graph or a donor report existed. We may craft gardens so fertile with attention, compassion, and truth that entire communities not only survive but truly come alive.\nAnd that, I believe, is what real impact looks like.\n\nFinal Thought\nWhen we stand next to someone—whether a refugee, a farmer crushed by debt, or a family in Palestine facing daily violence—and say, “You are not my data point; you are my friend,” we enact the very transformation we hope to see in the world. We show that life isn’t a mechanical series of inputs and outputs, but a shared tapestry of stories, joys, and struggles.\nMay we all become craftspeople and gardeners of this new paradigm—humans who measure thoughtfully but love wholeheartedly, who plant seeds of change with skilled hands and open hearts, cultivating relationships that outlast any spreadsheet.\nConclusion: Success at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact, but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way? Think of a food forest—it’s successful in every moment, even in winter’s decay. It isn’t waiting for harvest to declare success. Similarly, real transformation emerges when we let quality recognition guide us at each step, rather than fixating on some distant “scalable” end.\n“We can’t take down the master’s house with the master’s tools. We need to trust in something deeper.”\nMaybe we start small, document what emerges when we trust this process, build evidence through real stories of transformation, and let the work speak for itself. We could become gardeners—crafting conditions for people to come alive—rather than assembly-line managers producing forced outcomes.\nI believe we can pioneer a different way of working: trust quality recognition first, build like gardeners, develop through relationship and practice, and measure only what truly serves beauty. This approach might feel risky, but it leads to more authentic impact—one that sustains people’s dignity and fosters real transformation.\nThat, in essence, is what I think social impact can be. By trusting the deeper capacity in all of us to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true, we can finally step beyond hollow metrics into the living reality of meaningful work.\n"

            "extracted_content": "Loving My Baby Instead of Fixing the World.\nOne day, I held my 6-month-old baby, his soft face against my chest. Early morning light poured through our windows, painting the walls orange. In that instant—his tiny hand on mine, war raging in Palestine, the future uncertain—I felt a wave of awe. I remember crying and thinking: This moment is enough for a life.\nThat quiet morning would have been so boring to me when I think of my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016). I was in elite circles discussing life extension or pitches, no one seemed to value a simple life, and it seemed no one had babies. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought of the human will.\n\nWhatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, we nerds started getting rich for the same traits that led to us being bullied in school. In that bubble, Marc Andreesen’s prophecy that “software would eat the world” felt more like a battle cry than the warning it should have been. I think there’s a literal movie called Revenge of the Nerds, seems like this is another moment when life mimics fiction I guess. We devoured his essays, wrote code to cut repetitive tasks, and started businesses to solve any friction we saw—and it “worked.”\n\nIn my Muslim household in Michigan, I was raised to believe this life was just a test. Yet, everything I learned while crashing the country's elite technical university, MIT, told me the world was understandable, malleable, and ours to shape.\n\nMany of my college friends went on to leave their mark on the world, start businesses, build satellite technology, or get jobs at Google. Making money was a sign that they did something valuable, and thus the richer some of us got, the more we all believed they were on the right path. We knew that knowledge is power, innovation is king, and by our collective guidance, humanity is destined for the stars. \nDriven by optimism, I launched a makerspace in Michigan and a robotics company, confident that success was measured by dollars earned and problems solved. My mantra was, \"If we can, we should.\" Our creations would lead to a flourishing future as more people joined the movement. Around this time, the Arab Spring ignited hope among young Arabs like me, inspiring a new idea to take shape.\nWith the hackerspace growing at home and the robotics company launching our factory robot I believed we could replicate this energy around the world and create an army of positive change makers, all working on technology and entrepreneurship to shape a better world. It sounded good to me back then, and that’s how I came to found the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), to take the ideas I learned at MIT and Silicon Valley—both of which felt more like temples to a religion of science and progress than a university– “back home” to Iraq and South West Asia and North African (SWANA) more broadly. \n\nI started in Egypt with Maker Faire Africa, the thought was to infect people with transmissible ideas by giving them a direct experience of innovation hubs. In those days, the Arab Spring was still young, and people were excited to see a youth movement topple authoritarian regimes. Growing up as an Iraqi American, I remember hushed conversations in my family’s living room, stories of how a so and so had vanished after a stray comment about the government shared with only direct family members. It led me to believe that direct opposition to the leadership was not an intelligent way forward for the movement. Taking what I learned from Silicon Valley, I suggested that instead of asking for a different future - we should build it. \n\nSeeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future if its young people gathered together in spaces, collaborating, innovating, and starting businesses was an appealing idea for people around the world, and I received recognition and support. That recognition was enough to fuel me; I was on the right path; fame and glory, and probably money too, was soon to be mine. Yet somehow, I had forgotten the stories of my family members killed during a war now recognized internationally as being started by a deliberate lie about weapons of mass destruction. My work started involving me in global geopolitical issues I was dimly aware of, and I was a grain of sand swirling around in a dust storm. \n\nI promised a beautiful vision of the world, a grassroots rag-tag team of technology-powered super-hackers out to build a better future, car bombs or no car bombs. Back then, the reality of how power, money, and conflict were interrelated was invisible to me. \n\nAll I knew was that I started feeling uneasy. Once, while I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera and highlighted as a “youth leader,” I left the call feeling proud, and that pride made me uneasy. What the heck was I doing? Who was I helping? Why was I trying to help anyone? \n\nMy work took me around the world, including active conflict areas, and it was after a trip to a refugee camp in Qah, Syria, where I was working on a storytelling project for young children, that led me to start to doubt my work. I heard story after story of [[[censored for your sanity]]]. Yet those same people who experienced so much violence offered me food and shelter. I had brought solar-powered lights for a shadow puppet workshop, thinking I could be helpful. In truth, I was the one being helped.\n\nWhen I returned to San Francisco from Qah I found myself invited to Facebook’s end of year party. It was around that time I learned that two beautiful seven-year-old girls from the camp—Katya and her friend—had been killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school. All the fun and opulence of the startup scene felt obscene.\n\nThat’s when the power of the stories of technology changing the world for the better started dissolving. How could we pretend we’re “making the world a better place” when this was the reality children were facing, and this was a tiny glimpse into a world of hurt? That’s when the Silicon Valley religion of making the world a better place died for me.\n\nFor a couple of years after that, I was numb. I felt like the curtains had been pulled back, and I saw the show for what it was, (my) egocentricity and love for wealth and power disguised as a story about changing the world. Not knowing what to do, I joined another Silicon Valley religion: mindfulness meditation. It promised peace in this life without worry, and I dove in wholeheartedly, seeking to escape my inner turmoil and loss of compass. \n\nIn 2013/2014, I would meditate every day for an hour in a park. One of these days, I found that as I was doing my body scan meditation, going ring by ring down my body, at some point, when I arrived at my groin, I felt like I was pierced by a sword, and I lept out of my cross-legged position. As I hobbled over to my bike, confused and in pain, I wondered: “What just happened? Why am I in this much pain?”\n\n\nBefore heading home, I checked my phone for directions home and saw that someone from Iraq had sent me an urgent message. Back in 2013, working with [redacted], we had brought open-source radiation sensors to validate Iraqi doctors' claims that the depleted uranium ammunition from the wars was resulting in increased cancer rates. The story of that adventure is for another time; this time, let’s focus on the phone message.  [Redacted]'s call for help was the start of a turnaround for me. He was being threatened with death, allegedly for the work we did together, “collaborating with Americans.”\n\nI realized that I was far away, unable to help, and getting good people into trouble for doing “good work.” I realized that I was creating communities, yet not a part of any of them. I wasn’t even sure what good looked like anymore. Every Silicon Valley salon felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, every talk I was invited to give, a lie… until, one day, I stood at the podium and blurted out: “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.” The audience smiled and nodded, looking at me pitifully. They must have known about Katya and the girls at Qah.\n\nAfter that, the speaking agencies stopped calling. I grew increasingly insular, slept a lot, and often didn’t leave my house for days on end. My meditation practice wasn’t helping, I found greater distance from my feelings, a lack of desire, and what I felt as a growing comfort with numbness. Looking back, I can see that these were all symptoms of undiagnosed vicarious Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I knew about PTSD, yet I didn’t realize that my experiences of car bombings in Iraq, the deaths around me, and living/working in war zones could have scarred me for years without ever being physically injured. \n\nOne day, while deep in the haze of trauma, sugar-coated with the equanimity of mindfulness, I met my future wife. In those days, I was at such a loss, I was “looking within” for guidance, working on accessing my intuition, reflecting on the world, and coming up with theories of change, attempting to understand the news, social media, open source technology, impact, goodness, etc. Yet I couldn’t figure it out. I was rejected from every fellowship I applied to from Harvard to the Bay and I was going in intellectual circles. \n\nWhen I met Josephine, I remember thinking, “This time, I will listen to something else, no more ideas and explanations.” Logic had failed me thus far. Every time I came up with a theory of change, every business plan to change the world, every time I was smart in relationships, it had not worked. This time, something else spoke up. The moment I hugged Josephine, I felt my shoulders relax, and a quiet voice said, “Yes.”\n\nThat was the first time I listened to the voice of deeper meaning. In my life, I find this voice hard to listen to, and when I hear it - it’s been easy to ignore. Yet, seeing that voice was like a light in the darkness. A calling to a different way of being in the world. One that seemed irrational and unlikely to make me famous or rich. One that told me to call my mom and spend time in nature. A voice that wasn’t about understanding the world and leveraging it to serve me… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.\n\nThese were the early days of healing for me. I realized I had to stop listening to myself and listen to something else, yet I didn’t know what my new path was. What was the voice? How could I know it was trustworthy? How would I explain it to my hyper-rational, reductionist friends?\n\nI was searching for things that made my heart sing. My spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what I deeply believed: that God is beautiful and loves beauty. I chose to use my life to follow a path of beauty. That way, when I died either way life was beautiful.\nMy religious and spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what was true to me at the core. I found the Islamic principle that God is beautiful and loves beauty stood the test of reason and spirit. If I chose to live a beautiful life I’d have a beautiful life, and when I die… well, we’d see then. \n\nThis exploration led me to Krista Tippett’s On Being, a podcast full of stories about selflessness, care, and the beauty of human potential. When I heard Jean Vanier’s story of building communities for people with disabilities, something in me cracked open. For the first time in years, I cried, and those tears reminded me that I was still human.\nI listened to nearly every episode, but Father Greg Boyle’s story finally unlocked a path forward. The founder of Homeboy and Homegirl Industries, he helps former prisoners reintegrate with jobs, tattoo removal, and community support. When asked why he does this work, he didn’t say, “God told me to,” or, “It’s the right thing to do.” He simply said, “They’re my friends. So what else would I do?” That response shifted everything for me.\nFather Boyle working for a future outcome or trying to make a dent in the universe. His actions weren’t tied to expectations or good intentions—they emerged naturally from his way of being. The immediacy, focusing on living beautifully in the present moment, showed me that don’t need to have good intentions, that beauty isn’t about solving the world’s problems; beautiful actions emerge from true relationships, that truth builds relationships of love, and love gives birth to beauty. \n\n\nOver the next few months, I mulled Father Boyle’s words over in my mind and by 2016, I found myself on a plane to Beirut. Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night, where my nerd community was, and where the challenges of the Syrian refugees were most intense. It was there that we started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.\n\nSaleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas. He was born in a Syrian Palestinian refugee camp, and he had led a tough life up until we met in the refugee camps of Beirut. It was while he was hiding from the police at my house that we decided to start Beit Al Atlas. At Beit Al Atlas, we would host artists, international journalists, and for whatever reason, many people from Denmark. Early mornings the house would fill with the smell of coffee and the melodious sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our international resident from India, would make coffee for the house.\n\nSlowly, the house became a home for Saleh and me, a garden for the Syrian refugees who worked polishing shoes on our doorstep, a place for book clubs and dinners, and most importantly, a place for stories and connection. The house faced many struggles, yet through our diversity and connections through love with people around the world, we always found enough support to keep the doors open and the coffee pouring. \n\nAs beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself properly. When I moved to Beirut, Josephine had been wanting me to live with her, to marry her, to start a family together. She would visit the house, and at some point, Ahmed, one of the Syrian refugees who became part of our family, took off one of his rings and gave it to me, saying: Bilal, give this ring to Josephine to give to you. Enough already, go get married and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful.”\n\nI stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s worth of earnings for him. Yet he gave it to me so I could do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman my heart said yes to, the woman who loved me.\n\nBack then, I was too invested in having an impact. Living in Beirut and building this house was more important than love, stability, and babies. That’s when I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good,” even if Saleh was my friend, even if the house was authentically building beautiful and unlikely cross-cultural relationships, I was ignoring something profound, I was ignoring the one who loves me. Ahmed helped me see that, even though he left Syria when he was 11 after his father was shot by the Asad regime, even though he speaks with a lisp - a potential mark of deep trauma, he helped me see the beautiful thing to do. In the Muslim tradition, it’s said that the best charity is the charity one gives to one’s family, it’s said that those who are nearest to you deserve the most of you, and somehow, I was committing my life to beautiful friends, yet leaving alone and sad in France the person who wants to start a family with me. \n\nThis is when I finally started a more profound process of submission. Through Ahmed’s guidance, I was able to see that the Muslim tradition that I had left in Michigan so long ago had keys to a life in service to the quiet voice I found so hard to hear. By submitting my life to my sense of beauty, to the voice, and realized that that voice also left us many clues within us, in the world, and in the beautiful stories of the prophet and his Holy Book, the Quran. My relationship with submission to the divine could take a whole other book, let’s suffice it here to say that I started seeing the deeper wisdom in a tradition I had been ignoring. Finally, leaving the religion of progress, of what I thought goodness was, the religion that wants the self to leave a mark on the world, positive or not, made room for me to submit to a most Merciful God that is weaving the most beautiful story possible.\n\nIt was then that I finally started the long journey back to that moment in France. And so I packed my bags, leaving Beit Al Atlas in the capable hands of Saleh and friends. I flew to France to finally honor the commitment I’d kept in limbo—the commitment that opened the doors to baby Suleiman and that moment at the threshold of 2024, where I was holding my baby, feeling that all was just as it should be in this crazy world cradled in the hands of the most Merciful.\n\nThe first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity as someone who goes where the difficulties are, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, etc, and works to build community and create beauty in unexpected places. In a world that pushes us to greater heights, usually implying further and further distance from yourself, your wife and children, your parents, cousins, and high school friends, I've been working to slowly reintegrate myself with myself, build a loving home with my wife, making space for our baby Suleiman, and it all came full circle that morning as I held little Suli and cried. One eye overflowing with tears of sorrow… the other eye with tears of love.\n"

            "extracted_content": "Okay, so we're going to be writing an essay with our voice because one of my skills and competencies and something that I pride myself in is my ability to follow a thread clearly and coherently and articulated, and this content must be mine and come from my heart and not be external and also it must be connected to all realities. It's my intention that this becomes a snapshot of my thinking about the truths that I've discovered in my life and the realities they imply towards a good life and how that impacts the sense of speed, rush, fear, otherness, alienation, and impending disaster with the climate, the wars the mistrust of our neighbors and the lack of time and space and knowledge of what to do with ourselves. I'm indebted to my mom who shared with me in October of 2011 their aid prayer from Mecca, and in that prayer there was a talk and in that talk the speaker, shared the idea that God is beautiful, and he loves that which is beautiful and in that time, I was very hurt and unable to accept all of the tradition that I had been raised with because it was getting in the way of me trusting my heart, and that tension the reality that this person I respected and admired was some one that my heart honestly could lean towards and brought me aliveness was fighting with the textual reality of the lack of an articulated Islam or Christianity that I could check some box in an accounting system with the god and with my family to say that this woman is a Muslim and therefore I am allowed to have these feelings. rather than the fear, hope, trepidation, openness, wonder anticipation heart opening heart racing, mind spinning possibility, of accepting love.  I remember laying down on the ground outside and she asked me, do you love me? and rather than taking a moment to take a deep breath to look inside of my heart, and to say the truth of what I found, I deflected. I asked for literalism.  I asked how do you define love? There are places within us that know love that can distinguish love from lust and in my confusion and desire to be confused to avoid the pain and the stress and the fear of confronting my family and confronting the check box guard and religion that I had invented that wasn't the true way of interpreting are the only way I deflected and created confusion in my life and compounded that confusion for years and years I allowed myself in that confusion to create a shadow and to have the part of me that was alive to live in that shadow. I nook out of the house in the dark to be able to be with the parts of me that were actually alive and I lived like a zombie, having not slept and like a zombie because in the day I was living waiting for the night distant from my heart, distant from the thing that knows the truths of the world and the truths within myself. and in October 2011 I was given one of the keys of a trifecta that allowed me to open my heart and to connect reintegrate with my emotions, with my feelings, with my perception of beauty, with my sense of meaning and sense of self, and ultimately, at long last, the realizations that beauty is the splendor of truth. and beauty is that which draws you into love, and that the perception and recognition of beauty is a part of a faculty that is inextricable from that perception and that reality.  This faculty within us that sees beauty is the place where we can answer the questions of what is true and the confusions that we might have about what is actually good How should we live? What is real? My background as someone who loves science and technology and philosophy and rationalizations.  I think connects to this desire for control and this lack of engaging with the fear and the reality of the bird that when it wakes up and opens its eyes and sees its hungry children, and leaves its nest in fear and hope, seeking the worms, the seeds, the sustenance and the awe in the wonder and the gratitude and the aliveness at finding it. This way of seeing the world and living in the world requires both eyes, we do have a rational faculty We can think ahead to plant seeds now to organize our land, to let land rest after understanding soil depletion so that we can have a better harvest next year and I've realized that this love of planning and stability along with my rejection of the tradition that was brought to me that was teaching me how to open the eye of the heart. limited me from being able to explore in an open way, and the only way that's real on the tight rope of life to keep my eyes focused on beauty and to walk without looking down knowing and not knowing that the next step is going to land and that will be okay and that will make it. because the rope is invisible to the tight rope walker. It's just sensed, just like the worm is invisible to the bird. and in the muslin tradition were given many promises of what happens to those who trust and have god consciousness that these are those that are successful.  And these beliefs I think must be taken gradually, step by step. You take one step, that proves the rope is there, you leave one morning, you find the worms, but winter comes, things change, the wind blows, and the rope moves ever so slightly. and so I believe that it's not that we must avoid planning planting the seeds and using our mind, but that we need as a society to traverse this canyon. We are in a place where our stasis is destructive, our not changing is damaging, and I believe the roots of why staying the same is damaging is connected to the roots that have alienated us from this perception of beauty and truth and goodness, and even trusting that this means something that it's not an emotion only that it may have states ways that are uplifting inspire us.  You watch a movie about Nelson Mandela and you leave uplifted the sense of possibility and hope and maybe you think to yourself, how can I be a little more like that? And so the first thing that happened to me after my partner broke up with me because I could not face the fear. of the reality that was being that was beckoning the reality of I love this person and I don't know what to do. I'm young I don't know my faith.  I don't know myself. I don't know what love actually means. that love is the splendor of truth and that beauty and truth and love come together and that if I wanted to know God and how to live I have to read all three books the book of revelation, the book of inner insight and looking within our feelings, our thoughts, even our negative ruminations, and the book of the outer world the beauty of a river flowing down a mountain and a waterfall, and fish below in a clear pond eating the bugs on the river and then if you follow that river as it passes through human civilization on the other side, you look again into the water, and you find ugliness, a weird slimy color, a film on the top of the water potentially dead fish, a bad smell it repulses you. and why is that the case? How is this also true and how is that assign?  These signs of repulsion could have prevented us from continuing down this path the they would say the smell of London in the 1800s the squalor the tight neighborhoods with sewage flowing down the middle and Jack the Ripper and the pollution bellowing into the air and kids coming home in the morning after working at night shift in a factory and injuries and I'm sure people knew this wasn't beautiful. yet it helped increase the sense of control because there was a a power to it that could be grown resources accumulating into the hands of the owners allowing more allocating according to their desires and whims, unchecked and unpurified and unhe held up against the example of beauty and this alienation from the things that make life meaningful, require us to fill it with a hope that the future will be better. I don't feel so good right now, but I believe in this progress that we're making, this idea of progress links in deeply with this idea of how the reward system within us works. our sense of accomplishments and reward and the molecule dopamine that symbolizes it is not from achievement. It's not from making a goal and accomplishing it.  The reward comes from the expectation of a good, and so as long as we were able to tell ourselves in each other, this world might not be good to day, but to morrow it will be better when technology improves when we're able to extract more from less when we have to work less, this claim that, you know, we increase productivity and somehow work less and enjoy more is not what has happened at all. We've increased productivity and working hours, and at the same time we're reducing wages. This confusion about what is good, what do we want from life, this sense of mastery has been possible for only 200300 years and it was made possible from the primary disconnect from people with some their core faculty that is able to see and then the practice of implementing the seeing of beauty into a cycle of life that shows that you can take another step on that tight rope towards a more beautiful future and instead we went into a command and control into a cycle of allowing the things that think a we are able to control our situation and preserve our station and expand our domination and to manage people and the planet and the colonies and to do all of this in a way where we start having the science of productivity and the science of the polity and political science and we have this illusion of being able to get what we want without ever opening the eyes within us that can know what we actually want, and with only one eye, we can only see what we think we want, our needs, our fears, our expectations, and we try to address those, but it's it's a bottomless pit because the only thing that can really fill those is the eye that is able to see our true desires for love, beauty, connection, and the things that are truly satisfying.  And so what happens as we fall into lust or we fall into gluttony, or we fall into laziness, and we build escalators, and then when our bodies start falling apart, we go to the gym. And so understanding that dohamine is this reward molecule, I think is really important to see why we always imagine heaven as to morrow and that promise that things will be better, I think, kept people in a cage of anticipation and patience. of gritting our teeth kind of patience, but then, as we see in to day's world, we see that our uncontrolled, desire for control has expanded our unbeautiful ways of being into manipulating more of the world into ugliness into factories that fall on the people working to make our clothes and into promoting consumption just to be able to maintain the systems into this problematic situation that we find ourselves in that I think really is exemplified by this disconnect between this faculty that knows what is actually good and beautiful rather than the faculty that sees and wants for oneself, it's the faculty that sees and in that seeing can be satisfied in the connection and relating and and then we can talk very plainly about the rise of suicide. uh being one of the leading causes of death for young people, the beginning of suicides in preteens, which is unthinkable and it is kind of vague sense of anxiety they say that in the last 30 years the levels of anxiety have skyrocketed around the world, and we're coming to a place where I think we have to open that other eye. And I think so many people know this and part of the taste of it was during the pandemic when people uh were unable to go to the work that they were distracted by they started making sour dough, right?  connecting to the arts and to the crafts and to sharing, like you don't make a whole loaf of sourdough and eat it by yourself, and you don't even make the sourdough by yourself, you make it in collaboration with the yeast, and you wait and there's this recognition of a beauty in working with systems, working within and for systems, and they might think of it as a silly example, but as more people looked into their own lives and asked like, I'm at home and I'm with myself. What what should we do? You know people read books.  Maybe for the first time in a long time. and began to touch the parts of themselves that, you know, like when you really immersed in a book, you have a sense of it. It's not the facts of the text and the page that you're reading adding up to a narrative that you have in your mind and some kind of system of social relations that maps on to how you connect with faces and people and no, there's like there there there is a way we need to point at this reality that there's parts of us that know that I believe have been gas lit and undermined and doubted because it's not convenient. just like I couldn't say I love you to a person I loved because it would damage my relationship with my family, my self identity as a Muslim who didn't really know his religion or tradition. I think we all are unable to realize that it's way better to be that bird than to go out until eat the worm in awe and in wonder and defeat our family and to love, and to be alive, then to have complete and utter control, you know, Elon Musk and some of these transhumanists are trying to plug computers into our brains and give us, you know, cognitive capacities that far surpass what we're able to and we have to go to Mars and colonize because we want to preserve consciousness.  And these may not be the worst ideas, but we have to ask like, what's the Tological conclusion, you know? this idea of ad Astura to the stars, right, is highly motivating for many thoughtful, philosophical, wealthy, intelligent, computer science majors who have went into silicon Valley and made money somehow, like this idea of the beauty and discovery, although the beauty of nature and looking at the heavens is also connected to this realization of the grandeur of it that felt sense of oh my God, this is incredible and I get to be here and witness and the humility of seeing signs everywhere, you know, verses the kind of logical conclusion we get from how people are trying to cure death. and live forever, leading to this realization that if they had their way, what would be better then dividing the entire universe into matter that will produce energy for the conscious machines and machines that experience the ultimate pleasure constantly, you know, in the world of the effective altruists, they are talking about these things. They're talking about like, is this the most beautiful future we can imagine, which is ultra hedonistic consciousness that has colonized the entire universe and and then what, right?  and the idea of what is beautiful in every moment has infinite faces and your response in every moment can respond in a beautiful way of of infinite path gives you the infinity that we seek and the participation in a chorus and a choir in the moment right now. and sure we might have to protect ourselves if an asteroid is coming and gonna wipe out humanity, having Mars be a planet for us could be an interesting thing as an ultimate backup, but if you look at it, you know wires doesn't have a magnetic field, it would have to have a colony that is encapsulated and food grown in greenhouses and importing much from the earth. And sure it may be over time generations and generations or talking thousands of years since we live forever, it can become a habitable planet through our innovation and our our work, but I also think there is something important about knowing what the right thing to do is and the dangers. Those dangers, the vast majority of the existential dangers that Elon Musk is talking about are because we can't live together in peace on earth, and that comes about because of this lack of recognition, of a foundational faculty and perception that knows the whole that has access to seeing the end state of the entire complex system that they're trying to model and can inform us what is a beautiful way of being through residence, through self-reflection, through self understanding, and this perception directs our attention.  We can think of it like we're wr rung like a bell, and then we can hear what color or what sound we are, right? We don't know that we're a bell in the key of c or that we're a marimba and the key of sea or something. but that perception that we have that is connected to all people's perceptions of beauty and our perception of beauty and truth and love and goodness, that thing is able to inform our actions with humility rather than arrogance. All of our complex systems are false.  They measure tiny fraction of the reality, but we have access to the thing that tells us the now good thing if we can remove some of our biases and our pensions for self preservation, and if we do these things, we don't need to go to Mars. immediately sure our son will explode so we have to have options and sure that knowledge of what the universe is like will continue to evolve and, you know, the asteroid might be coming and I hope we detect it. I don't want to have this moment of looking up and feeling like I didn't live, you know, and if we look up and we're on the process of building our Mars colony, but the rockets haven't launched yet. Imagine the ultimate regret, the pain and the suffering, the infinite moment of agony if the rockets start falling, someone accidentally pushed the red button. and the opposite, imagine if you were trying your best to listen to the one thing that knows everything that also tells you how you can best use your gifts, your pensions, your natural inclinations, your place in the world, the relationships you have. to act in harmony with that, and if more people did this and connected with that part of us, if I didn't say please define love so that I can make sure that on Mars we have a checklist of loving people if I said, I feel deeply that I love you and I'm scared and I don't know what to do about it.  We could have had a very different conversation life would have been very different, but because I had that experience, I have a lesson. and I have a story and thankfully I have a turnaround because in 2004, I met the person whom I love today. And when I met her, the relationship didn't make sense. She was from a different part of the world.  She spoke a different language. We didn't resonate and play off of each other's creativity. wasn't a strong, you know, desire for intimacy was different. But I decided finally, for once in my life, I'm not going to think my way into a relationship and say, what will my parents think?  Does this make sense, according to the religion I was given? That was supposed to tell me who God was and how we want to live, and instead trust the thing that religions try to connect you with that part of us that can know truth. and when I met my wife and I held her, my shoulders dropped, I felt connected to my body and to her and there was a leaning towards there was a yes. And this is very early in our relationship. and so somehow I also kind of believe there's a non-emporal nature to that viewing, that complex system isn't just telling the story of the now that complex system that oneness is everything and every time and telling you now how to be a part of the beautiful story that wants to happen, and it's possible to listen to that.  And it requires only to trust small experiments towards becoming beautiful, and to think through logically and understand who we actually want to be. What are the worldviews that we've taken on? What are the schemas, the frameworks?  What do you think your feelings are? What do they imply? What do they mean?  Are they random? Why is it impossible to be satisfied? with so many options on Amazon and deliveroo and tinder What's happening?  What is good? I gave a talk once called good as hard. and it was about two people who chose two ways of being for two very different reasons. One chose it out of love love for their patience and developed the lobotomy, something that we now look back at and realize its tragedy, but in his time, his love defined its use case.  It was only for the most severe cases when nothing else would work, and it was only to protect themselves from themselves and their families. and it worked. The challenges people monopolized this procedure because they found a hack to do it faster and simpler and make it more efficient, and rather than risking life and having to make an incision in the skull and realize the immensity of that decision, they were able to use a thin metal stick and to use the tear duct behind the uh, right on top of the eye and to break the thin bone very easily at the back of the a bit lobe and and to conduct a lobotomy and the reasoning wasn't how best to help our patients was it let it became how can we do as many of these as possible for financial gain? and then people came back from world War II, injured and traumatized, and this rational way of thinking, this efficiency oriented way of thinking led to many more lobotomies being made than were needed, and Fritzaber, who out of fear and a desire for the longing and acceptance in a German state as a Jewish scientist decided he must solve the problem of the lack of fertilizers which were being blockaded from South America for the bombs that Germany wanted to make to kill, to conquer, to expand, to control.  And so in order to feel and to connect and to be a part of that society as someone who is at risk in that society as a Jewish person, he found a way to be useful to a death machine by creating the nitrogen fixing process. His nitrogen fixing process came from and an optimization of death. How can we make bombs out thinner?  And this technology became what fed our planet because we were able to create massively bulked produce around the world because we had nitrogen-based fertilizers that were easy to manufacture and produce, and so he wanted over a price and so did at germonitz, the inventor the lobotomy. Both of these people on stage receiving the novel Prius, must have felt differently. It must have been confusing, I imagine, for Fritzaber after the war, having his technology been used for other more humane purposes, but there seems to be something about this efficiency mindset, this orientation for something from nothing that requires nothing of us to be to extract out of thin air rather than to participate in the systems of guano and animals and digging in the dirt and people involvements and all of that rather than this mechanized world that turns air into little white pellets, and we see now that those nitrogen fertilizers are being overused are food is less nutritious the water in the Mississippi takes all that run off from the farms and creates a giant dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where nothing can live. and initially, when I first gave this talk, I was still confused.  I didn't realize that good is hard, meant that it's possible too, know what is good, but you have to stay connected to the part of you that sees, and so innovate, invent the lobotomy, but for all of us that want to apply it, we have to apply it with that connection to both efficiency, rationality, optimization, protection, systems, and the part that knows goodness and beauty. And that part that knows goodness and beauty is a step back and it requires us to step back, requires us to look at the looking and to see what we're doing and to ask, and we know these things. I think in communities where we are mirrors to each other and this is why I've been working on this process that I call come alive because our lives depend on it.  I work in social entrepreneurship and social change and impact, and I realize the challenge that we have of instrumentalizing people, we have a perverse intent incentive sometimes when you see that we need problems to exist for our businesses to exist, so do we really want to solve it. rather than the business existing taking second priority to doing something that helps us come alive and give and just like that rope is real, just like the bird leaves and trusts and knows that like we live in a beautiful planet and we know it, you know. As long as we accept that we're a part of this amazing place in these systems, as long as we stay within these systems of nurturing life and give back to them as much as we take in a sense like staying beautiful, I think there is a way into safety and into old age and in whatever is beyond, just like the bird, the good the bird does for the trees that it eats its seeds is it spreads its seeds and its poop and so sometimes when we are deeply integrated in loving ways with each other and the systems that provide life, and we are coming alive even our accidental byproducts can be sources of life. And when we reduce our need for systems and for savings accounts and retirement funds, I really believe that life supports that which supports life. and getting into these ways of being in harmony and perceiving and pursuing that which is beautiful meaningful and true connecting our eye of rationality, where our eyes of intentional submission to the good, I think we're gonna be okay. that we will be able to change in this dynamic ever changing time because that is the nature of aliveness. the fear of the future, the rate of change, is a problem for Stasis, not of a liveness.  It doesn't matter if we get holographic lenses and, you know, telepresence at some point It's going to be okay. We will know how to live then because we will be able to know the thing that is timeless within us that brings the new way of being now that we're being wr rung again that my bell is in the key of C, and this is what it looks like here, echoing off of the auditorium malls. And so I think it sounds crazy.  I think I tried to do a good job explaining my personal experience. The philosophical rigor behind it, the logical sense that it makes the historical disconnect from Descartes and Galileo, and the consequences of materialism leading to the accruel of more material to capitalism, to neolioliberalism, and the consequences of these mindsets. stemming from a hyper focus of a single part of our rational and perceptual faculties, and that all the other forms of currency that are possible and wealth that are possible, and a fourth dimension in time, along with the other three, that expands because we have access to an infinite unfolding that is clear and is evoked in everyone's life at some point if they ask for their sources of meaning, like tell me about a meaningful moment what was happening. What were you attending to?  And in doing that we can clarify one of the ways that the infinite goodness and beauty wants to enter into this world into time through you and if we do that, and we tell these stories, I think we can be our own role model and the role model for each other. We can uplift through not self sacrifice and do well and do good or whatever. It's just do good and do well, you know?  We have to flip it. do well and trust that we will do good and that good might not look like the same million dollar bank account retirement fund where you can escape climate collapse, living in New Zealand that good might be dealing with climate collapse knee deepened the flooding waters, bailing people out of their homes and planting gardens on rooftops. That could be your good. That could be your safety.  That could be a life that you love not a life that is safe and protected. And these ways of talking about values and these ways of thinking are derived from my interpretation of Sufi metaphysics and Islamic philosophy, from Joe Edelman's work on attentional policies and sources of meaning derived also inspired by Charles Taylor and my interaction in silicon Valley and growing concern and feeling of distance from the ways I used to think and I was, you know, at some point wanting to create good with technology and it wasn't working. And then I thought, okay, well, social enterprise and it's not working.  Um, what's good, you know, and I wasn't feeling good and we were rushing and racing and I really believe that we cannot create good until we are good ourselves and a part of that is letting some of our fears go, our desire for self-p protection and trusting more and that we will get the things that we want. when we direct our soldiers ourselves towards the things that we want to give now, we see how the beauty wants to unfold in our lives, how goodness wants to unfold and that it's not about sacrificing our life to create a fair trade coffee company and make less money, but be good for the planet or being good. It's not about being good by our actions and our decisions. It's about letting goodness be us, letting the goodness flow, and we know that through inspirational stories and even stories in our own lives and can we really trust that this will lead us to being just the right thing at just the right time?  I've always been inspired by the quote, don't ask what the world needs, ask. what makes you come alive because the world needs more people that have come alive and that's from Howard Thurman, one of the Christian theologians that have inspired. Martin Luther King Jr. and I believe that and I didn't know why it was true until I said deeply reflecting on it and realizing that this coming alive is related to humility and that humility is also related to learning, and that all of this is connected through one of these models that you can think of similar to the flow state. There is, you know, complexity of task and skill as axes and there's like this Goldilock zone in the metal where it's just out of reach for you, right?  And this idea that we can place ourselves in over our heads and places where we don't have the skills competencies, networks, relationships, understanding, because we think it's good and create a mess and waste investors, money and waste our life and our time versus who am I and what is the most beautiful thing that I am connected to, that I see, that wants to flow through me. am I that person that, you know, has aension for medicine and studied and and loves it and and it comes easily to me and I strive and I'm at that growth edge constantly, but also knowing that there's so much more to learn and and then maybe, if you were in the fifties, you might be the right person. if you felt care and concern for your patience to give somebody a lobotomy if they had to have one, maybe that's the most beautiful thing you could have done then. But then now, as we think about our actions and trying to find product market fit or what the world needs, or look at the SDGs because smart people at the UN design this system rationally and they have indicators and measures for everything, but everyone becomes a means to an end, even if that end is to have a thriving productive business that solves one of the challenges of the SDGs, it is using people's misery or the planet's suffering for the preservation of a system that can address it, and part of that system is the preservation of your life and its financial needs within the system versus integrating into that moment an I see it as like a bottom up and a top down. It's not that I don't like SDGs, but I think we should count SDGs after the fact.  We should be encouraging people uplifting them, asking them what they need to learn with skills, what do they see, how do they want to respond, letting the world be the classroom so that they find their growth edge and how they're going to be participating in all times and let them develop this care and this love and this aesthetic sense, and let them connect to the arts and let them know what beauty feels like and let them connect to wonder and their let's not destroy their sense of curiosity and experimentation and expansion, and let that contrast with the trip to the landfill or to the Ganges river and and let them see what rings inside of them then, you know explore tell the world your story, the story of yourself have authentic action. I remember when I was younger I was working in Iraq and suddenly there was interest from international NGO's to fund women in tech businesses, and they popped up everywhere. And I'm wondering to today how many of them remained you know, they can evolve, they might evolve, they should evolve because the nature is a constant unflow unfolding of infinity into reality when you're connected to that place where beauty comes, and you can't stand still.  You will fall behind. You must be open daily, and it's a practice daily to unfold your wings to come down and to look, and to see what new blessings are brought and to feel grateful you know, we are talking about, you know, gratitude practices, practices, but a gratitude practice is sometimes not going to be able to touch people because there is also the practice of stability, safety and protection and I deserve this, which is the complete opposite of ingratitude. It's this expectation, it's this entitlement and entitlement comes with the same mind that says, I did rather than I saw and I responded, and this shift so important because we cannot see and respond if we don't have that faculty which we do, and I think with my process of just asking people to look at their to do lists and to find the tensions within it because I believe that we are always seeing there.  And so all the things that we're doing are either aligned with that or not, some of them will bring us to life and bring us joy, and some of us won't. Some of those things that are to do that we do because we have to, and we're not questioning, but with a little bit of insight, some questioning, looking at the why behind the things, we can see which part of us we're emphasizing and until their imbalance our way of seeing the world quantitatively a way of seeing the world of entitlement to life only if and when we have clearly created value that is described through dollars otherwise irrit charity case, and there is shame and guilt involved in here until we change that by balancing that way of seeing of doing, of acting, of with the way of receiving, I realizing now that all of what I'm saying is very Taoist sounding, but even just a little bit of Taoism. you have all that yang just put that dot of yin in there, you know, and see what happens and then maybe slowly you can dive into that and come out the other side in a world of yen and then be able to shrink back when it's time for prioritization, and I think Barbara Frederickson and her work on Broden and build can be another scientifically backed way of both philosophically and scientifically understanding how pursuing these expansive states makes it possible for you to be more yourself in the right place at the right time doing the right thing and be supported and get all the things that you wanted in a way where you can receive them. I think this problem with receiving is also a problem with how we're trying to get our needs meant.  And so here I am in France, having been unable to accept the love that wants to flow through me and now I have a baby. and I'm here with my wife and that inkling of maybe this is the person has become more and more true as our love has grown more and more deep, because we are looking together towards that which invites beauty into our lives, and this openness to a meaningful life, a deeper conversation, and uh lots of forgiveness has been a blessing and what I'm working towards in my life is for success to be every step. This little framework might rhyme with the act, therapy framework, and another frameworks, but I hope the story and this way of thinking is convincing and I'm curious if there's any critiques or ways of seeing that I am missing that can either improve it or change it or show me another way that I would find beautiful. So I hope you're having a beautiful day.  And that you're opening up day by day to that which makes you come alive.\n"

Each question is a doorway into the book’s core themes.\n**Part I: The Crisis of Recognition**\n1. **What if meaning isn’t something we create, but something we recognize?**\n   * This challenges the modern assumption that meaning is *produced* rather than *perceived*—linking to your \"witnesser\" insight.\n2. **How did we lose our ability to trust direct knowing?**\n   * This dives into **The Great Forgetting**, exploring history, materialism, and the shift from direct perception to mediated systems.\n3. **Why do we measure impact, and what do we lose in the process?**\n   * This sets up the critique of social impact, rationalism, and the obsession with measurement.\n**Part II: The False Promises of Measurement**\n1. **What if rationality alone is not enough to guide us?**\n   * This tackles the **limits of materialism, data, and Enlightenment thinking**—showing why \"pure rationality\" is blind to meaning.\n2. **How does seeing people as numbers turn us into the very systems we seek to change?**\n   * This critiques the NGO, philanthropic, and development sectors that dehumanize people in the name of \"helping\" them.\n3. **Can an economy based on meaning, rather than extraction, actually work?**\n   * This moves toward practical applications—rethinking work, money, and social impact through a lens of meaning.\n**Part III: Reclaiming Direct Recognition**\n1. **What does it mean to see with two eyes—rationality and recognition?**\n   * This introduces your **stereoscopic vision** concept—seeing both *metrics* and *meaning* at once.\n2. **What happens when we shift from trying to change the world to being fully present with it?**\n   * This challenges activism and impact culture—pointing to **craft, friendship, and presence** as deeper forms of change.\n3. **How do we measure what matters—without losing what matters?**\n   * A paradox: how do we keep accountability while resisting control?\n**Part IV: The New Way Forward**\n1. **What if success isn’t a future goal, but something present in every moment?**\n* This ties into your **gardening metaphor**—the idea that real success isn’t in some distant metric, but in the **quality of each step**.\n**Book Structure: Unified & Refined**\n**Part I: The Great Forgetting**\n* How we lost **direct recognition of meaning**\n* How **measurement, control, and systems replaced trust in direct experience**\n* Historical shifts: Constantine, the Scientific Revolution, Capitalism\n* The emergence of **metrics-based meaning** (the factory mindset)\n**Part II: The False Promises of Rationality & Measurement**\n* How the **NGO/social impact sector became a mirror of capitalism**\n* Why **data and metrics aren’t neutral**\n* The **blind spots of \"rational\" approaches to impact**\n* The **problem of treating humans as instruments for our goals**\n* The **limits of optimization, measurement, and goal-seeking behavior**\n**Part III: Reclaiming Meaning Through Direct Recognition**\n* **Friendship as an alternative to impact metrics** (Father Greg Boyle)\n* **Craft, gardening, and apprenticeship as models for change**\n* **Learning to trust the second eye—the eye of recognition**\n* **How to shift from measurement to presence**\n**Part IV: The New Paradigm—Crafting a Garden of Meaning**\n* **How we build organizations, economies, and lives that prioritize meaning**\n* **Practical shifts: replacing dashboards with human presence**\n* **Scaling depth rather than breadth**\n* **The future of work: from extraction to craft**\n* **Final reflections: success at every step**\nCan you make a table to show all the different ways we've thought to organize this book?

Each question is a doorway into the book’s core themes.\n**Part I: The Crisis of Recognition**\n1. **What if meaning isn’t something we create, but something we recognize?**\n   * This challenges the modern assumption that meaning is *produced* rather than *perceived*—linking to your \"witnesser\" insight.\n2. **How did we lose our ability to trust direct knowing?**\n   * This dives into **The Great Forgetting**, exploring history, materialism, and the shift from direct perception to mediated systems.\n3. **Why do we measure impact, and what do we lose in the process?**\n   * This sets up the critique of social impact, rationalism, and the obsession with measurement.\n**Part II: The False Promises of Measurement**\n1. **What if rationality alone is not enough to guide us?**\n   * This tackles the **limits of materialism, data, and Enlightenment thinking**—showing why \"pure rationality\" is blind to meaning.\n2. **How does seeing people as numbers turn us into the very systems we seek to change?**\n   * This critiques the NGO, philanthropic, and development sectors that dehumanize people in the name of \"helping\" them.\n3. **Can an economy based on meaning, rather than extraction, actually work?**\n   * This moves toward practical applications—rethinking work, money, and social impact through a lens of meaning.\n**Part III: Reclaiming Direct Recognition**\n1. **What does it mean to see with two eyes—rationality and recognition?**\n   * This introduces your **stereoscopic vision** concept—seeing both *metrics* and *meaning* at once.\n2. **What happens when we shift from trying to change the world to being fully present with it?**\n   * This challenges activism and impact culture—pointing to **craft, friendship, and presence** as deeper forms of change.\n3. **How do we measure what matters—without losing what matters?**\n   * A paradox: how do we keep accountability while resisting control?\n**Part IV: The New Way Forward**\n1. **What if success isn’t a future goal, but something present in every moment?**\n* This ties into your **gardening metaphor**—the idea that real success isn’t in some distant metric, but in the **quality of each step**.\n**Book Structure: Unified & Refined**\n**Part I: The Great Forgetting**\n* How we lost **direct recognition of meaning**\n* How **measurement, control, and systems replaced trust in direct experience**\n* Historical shifts: Constantine, the Scientific Revolution, Capitalism\n* The emergence of **metrics-based meaning** (the factory mindset)\n**Part II: The False Promises of Rationality & Measurement**\n* How the **NGO/social impact sector became a mirror of capitalism**\n* Why **data and metrics aren’t neutral**\n* The **blind spots of \"rational\" approaches to impact**\n* The **problem of treating humans as instruments for our goals**\n* The **limits of optimization, measurement, and goal-seeking behavior**\n**Part III: Reclaiming Meaning Through Direct Recognition**\n* **Friendship as an alternative to impact metrics** (Father Greg Boyle)\n* **Craft, gardening, and apprenticeship as models for change**\n* **Learning to trust the second eye—the eye of recognition**\n* **How to shift from measurement to presence**\n**Part IV: The New Paradigm—Crafting a Garden of Meaning**\n* **How we build organizations, economies, and lives that prioritize meaning**\n* **Practical shifts: replacing dashboards with human presence**\n* **Scaling depth rather than breadth**\n* **The future of work: from extraction to craft**\n* **Final reflections: success at every step**\nCan you make a table to show all the different ways we've thought to organize this book? Perhaps it's 2 books? 3? perhaps a different kind of book\n\nLet's look at all our content and review it and make a recommendation before asking 3 questions to help make a choice",

Personal Journey (MIT to baby moment)\n2. Historical Analysis (Constantine to Silicon Valley)\n3. Social Impact Critique (NGOs to meaning)\n4. Philosophical Framework (Two eyes, recognition)\n5. Practical Applications (Craft, gardening)\n\n### Key Metaphors\n1. Two Eyes (Seeing)\n2. Bird (Trust)\n3. Bell (Recognition)\n4. Tightrope (Practice)\n5. Garden (Living)\n\n### Core Arguments\n1. Meaning is recognized, not manufactured\n2. We need both quantity and quality perception\n3. Current systems block recognition\n4. Beauty can guide action\n5. Success exists in every moment\n\n## Recommendation\n\nBased on the content analysis, I recommend a hybrid approach combining Structure Types 2 and 4:\n\n**A Single Book: \"Two Eyes Open: The Journey from Fixing to Recognizing\"**\n\nUsing personal narrative as the backbone but organized around key questions that drive each chapter. The metaphors become natural ways to illustrate the answers rather than organizing principles.\n\n### Why This Works:\n1. Personal story provides emotional engagement\n2. Questions create clear structure\n3. Metaphors illuminate naturally\n4. Historical analysis can weave throughout\n5. Practical applications emerge organically\n\n### Key Questions to Decide:\n1. Do you want to prioritize academic/historical credibility or practical accessibility?\n2. Is the personal journey strong enough to carry the theoretical weight?\n3. How important is it to maintain all the historical analysis?",

              "content": "# Strengthening the Framework: Addressing Gaps\n\n## 1. Making It Concrete\n\n### Current Gap\nAbstract concepts need grounding in tangible examples.\n\n### Solution Framework\nUse \"Pattern Triads\":\n1. Common Pattern (e.g., back pain at computer)\n2. False Solution (switching from social media to coding)\n3. Pattern Recognition (seeing the underlying worldview)\n\n### Key Questions to Develop\n- What are 5-7 clear pattern triads from your experience?\n- Which patterns are most relatable to your target audience?\n- How can each pattern illustrate the two-eyes metaphor?\n\n### Recommendations\n- Open each chapter with a pattern triad\n- Use visual diagrams to show pattern relationships\n- Include reader reflection questions to find their own patterns\n\n## 2. Strengthening Academic Foundation\n\n### Current Gap\nNeed stronger historical/theoretical framework without losing accessibility.\n\n### Solution Framework\nCreate \"Bridge Concepts\":\n1. Accessible Example (e.g., factory farming)\n2. Historical Root (e.g., Cartesian dualism)\n3. Modern Impact (e.g., current agricultural crisis)\n\n### Key Questions to Develop\n- What are the key historical turning points that shaped our worldview?\n- How do these connect directly to current problems?\n- What research/sources would strengthen these connections?\n\n### Recommendations\n- Include brief \"Deeper Dive\" sections for academic readers\n- Create clear historical timeline of worldview development\n- Reference key thinkers while keeping main text accessible\n\n## 3. Making It Actionable\n\n### Current Gap\nNeed clearer path from insight to action.\n\n### Solution Framework\nDevelop \"Recognition Practices\":\n1. Notice Pattern (what you're doing)\n2. Trace Worldview (why you're doing it)\n3. Experiment with Alternative (new way of seeing/doing)\n\n### Key Questions to Develop\n- What are 3-5 core practices for developing recognition?\n- How can readers start small and build confidence?\n- What support structures help maintain practice?\n\n### Recommendations\n- End each chapter with specific practice\n- Include success stories of pattern transformation\n- Create companion workbook/journal prompts\n\n## 4. Building Community Support\n\n### Current Gap\nIndividual readers need collective context.\n\n### Solution Framework\nDesign \"Learning Ecosystems\":\n1. Personal Practice\n2. Group Reflection\n3. Systemic Application\n\n### Key Questions to Develop\n- How can reading groups best engage with this material?\n- What organization-level practices support transformation?\n- How do we build communities of practice?\n\n### Recommendations\n- Include group discussion questions\n- Develop organizational assessment tools\n- Create online platform for practitioner exchange\n\n## 5. Worldview Transformation Framework\n\n### Current Gap\nNeed clearer process for shifting from old to new worldview.\n\n### Solution Framework\nMap \"Seeing Shifts\":\n1. Current View (metrics, control, fixing)\n2. Recognition Moment (pattern awareness)\n3. New View (relationship, cultivation, recognition)\n\n### Key Questions to Develop\n- What are the key worldview shifts needed?\n- How do these shifts manifest in different domains?\n- What supports/hinders worldview transformation?\n\n### Recommendations\n- Create worldview assessment tool\n- Map common resistance points\n- Provide transition support strategies\n\n## Critical Questions for Strengthening Book\n\n### Content Development\n1. What are your top 10 pattern triads that illustrate worldview impact?\n2. Which historical developments most clearly show the loss of recognition?\n3. What personal stories best illustrate each major concept?\n\n### Structure Refinement\n1. How can each chapter build pattern recognition capacity?\n2. What practice sequence best develops the \"second eye\"?\n3. How do we balance theory and application?\n\n### Impact Enhancement\n1. What organizations could pilot these ideas?\n2. How do we measure worldview transformation?\n3. What support structures need to be in place?\n\n## Key Recommendations\n\n### 1. Pattern Library\n- Develop 20+ clear pattern triads\n- Create visual pattern maps\n- Include reader pattern-finding tools\n\n### 2. Historical Framework\n- Create clear timeline of worldview development\n- Connect historical shifts to current patterns\n- Include key thinker profiles\n\n### 3. Practice System\n- Design progressive practice sequence\n- Develop assessment tools\n- Create support materials\n\n### 4. Community Building\n- Design group learning process\n- Create facilitator guide\n- Build online platform\n\n### 5. Impact Measurement\n- Develop worldview assessment tool\n- Create pattern recognition metrics\n- Design impact evaluation framework",

We’re stuck in a mechanistic, controlling worldview that:\nSees people (and nature) as resources to manage or fix,\nMeasures success with numbers alone,\nIgnores or undervalues quality, relationship, and meaning.\nYour Thesis:\n\"We need to reclaim our second eye—the one that perceives meaning, beauty, and living connection—if we want to solve personal, social, and ecological crises.\"\nEverything in the book should serve that central point: our worldview leads to patterns of behavior that cause insanity. Changing the behavior without changing the worldview is like swapping the poison in your cup for a different flavor of poison—still poison.\n2. Proposed Book Structure (12 Chapters)\n\nBelow is a suggested 12-chapter sequence—each chapter starts with a question that builds logically from the previous. Adapt as you see fit.\nPart I: Recognizing Our Madness\nChapter 1: \"Why Does It Feel Like We’re Dying Inside While 'Succeeding'?\"\nStory Hook: Modern anxiety: climate dread, tasteless fruit, meaningless jobs, etc.\nGoal: Show readers they’re not alone in feeling something’s off.\nChapter 2: \"Is Our Worldview at Fault?\"\nStory Hook: E.g., your grandmother’s decline or a personal anecdote about seeing “insanity” up close.\nGoal: Tease out how worldview → patterns. If we swap one tactic for another while the worldview stays the same, the result is still alienation.\nChapter 3: \"Where Did This Toxic Worldview Even Come From?\"\nStory Hook: Pick a historical moment: Constantine merges church and state, or the Black Death’s rise of individualism, or Enlightenment’s worship of numbers.\nGoal: Provide historical highlights that led to “one-eyed seeing.”\nPart II: How We Blind Ourselves Further\nChapter 4: \"Why Do 'Good' Fixes Still Yield the Same Results?\"\nStory Hook: Microfinance fiasco, or a local NGO that ends up replicating harmful patterns.\nGoal: Show that applying the same worldview to new solutions continues to produce the same alienation.\nChapter 5: \"What Happens When We Only See Quantity, Not Quality?\"\nStory Hook: The decline of food nutrients, the mania for more control.\nGoal: Illustrate that ignoring the second eye (quality) leads to deadening experiences—tasteless fruit, meaningless relationships, “fix the world with an app” illusions.\nChapter 6: \"Why Are We So Obsessed with Control (and Does It Even Work)?\"\nStory Hook: Silicon Valley’s big promises or billionaires’ bunkers.\nGoal: Critique the assumption that technology + data = real solutions; show that deeper relational/spiritual dimension is ignored.\nPart III: The Second Eye & Reclaiming Wholeness\nChapter 7: \"What If We Have Another Way of Seeing (Our 'Second Eye')?\"\nStory Hook: The Father Greg Boyle moment, the Russian officer trusting intuition, or your personal “two eyes” epiphany.\nGoal: Define “two eyes”: one for metrics, one for meaning.\nChapter 8: \"How Does Reclaiming the Second Eye Change Our Lives?\"\nStory Hook: Personal transformation examples—someone who left the corporate treadmill or built a meaningful local enterprise.\nGoal: Show how shifting worldview changes day-to-day decisions—like your “have-to vs. want-to” coaching framework.\nChapter 9: \"Can This Shift Transform Our Work and Social Impact?\"\nStory Hook: The “gardening vs. factory” analogy, success at every step, relational NGO examples.\nGoal: Illustrate new ways of measuring, new forms of business (Buurtzorg, etc.), and how that fosters real connection rather than exploitative metrics.\nPart IV: Living the New Paradigm\nChapter 10: \"If We Change Our Worldview, What Kind of Economy Emerges?\"\nStory Hook: The difference between a local food forest (every moment is “success”) and a factory farm (always pushing for yield).\nGoal: Envision an economy that’s about synergy with nature, relationships, and the sacred dimension of life.\nChapter 11: \"Aren’t We Too Late (Climate Collapse, Big Tech, etc.)?\"\nStory Hook: Real tension: despair about climate meltdown, unstoppable corporate power.\nGoal: Address the big cynicism. Affirm that worldview shifts can happen quickly, citing historical changes in consciousness (e.g., sudden leaps in social norms).\nChapter 12: \"So...How Do We Start Seeing With Both Eyes?\"\nStory Hook: End with a combination of personal reflection practices + small group or organizational steps.\nGoal: A practical blueprint for daily life—like journaling, real conversation, community activism, living with beauty and meaning at each step.\nConclusion: Summarize the entire arc. Restate that everything feels wrong because we’re using the wrong lens. Once we open the second eye, we see a living, connected reality—and that changes everything.\n3. Solve the “Worldview Leads to Patterns” Gap\n\nProblem to Address: People keep thinking “If we just do social capitalism instead of normal capitalism, we’ll fix it,” but they fail to realize they’re still adopting the same controlling, exploitative worldview, just re-labeled.\nHow to Solve It in the Book:\nIn Chapter 2 or 4: Show that each new approach (social enterprise, philanthropic capitalism, “green tech”) tries to solve problems within the old worldview.\nUse a Concrete Analogy: The back-pain scenario—switching from social media job to coding job doesn’t fix the underlying posture or worldview about “sitting at a computer all day.”\nDrive Home: “Changing tactics within the same worldview = same results.” Repeatedly highlight that the real pivot is from “seeing nature, people, and self as resources” to “seeing them as living relationships.”\n4. Guided Questions to Fill Important Gaps\n\nWhat are your best personal stories that illustrate worldview shifts?\nMake a short list. Readers remember stories more than lectures.\nWhere have you seen someone persist with the same worldview, or discover the second eye in a surprising way?\nWhich historical turning points best illustrate how worldview changed?\nYou mention Constantine, Black Death, Enlightenment, Industrial Revolution, Silicon Valley. Pick the top 2–3 that pack the biggest punch and keep the rest as brief references.\nWhere are your strongest real-world examples of “both eyes open” in practice?\nYou talk about orchard analogies, nonprofits like Buurtzorg, or Father Boyle. Plan to highlight them thoroughly in the latter chapters.\nHow do you help readers see the difference between superficial “good solutions” and real worldview change?\nIdentify a section (likely Chapter 4 or 5) to explicitly compare superficial fixes vs. deep shift.\nBe crystal clear: “Same logic, same results. Only a new lens produces new outcomes.”\nHow can you keep the book from feeling too negative or doomy?\nYou need examples of success, real shifts, hopeful glimpses.\nOffer steps, not to fix the entire planet, but to “awaken the second eye” in daily life.\n5. Recommendations to Strengthen the Book\n\nLean Hard on the Single Argument: Don’t meander with tangents. Keep hitting the “wrong worldview → insane results → we need the second eye” message.\nUse Vivid Metaphors & Anecdotes Consistently: E.g., back pain from two different desk jobs is still back pain. That’s a simple, direct metaphor people get.\nSprinkle Real “Success Stories” throughout the second half of the book to show it’s possible to live differently right now (even if the world still seems insane).\nEnd Each Chapter with a “Reflection or Practice” that helps the reader apply the concept. Could be a journal prompt, a question to ask a friend, or a micro-challenge.\nWatch Out for Information Overload: You love detail, but many readers just need the essential turning points in history. Keep it short, punchy, and connect it back to worldview change.\n6. Kickstart Your Writing\n\nPick the Chapter Questions (and finalize them) so you have a clear guide.\nBlock out a writing schedule: e.g., 2–3 days per chapter, generating a messy first draft.\nDraft fast, then refine. Don’t let perfectionism stall you. Your argument only refines once you see the big messy text on the page.\nFinal Word\nYou’ve got immense clarity on what’s wrong and how worldview shapes everything. Now, just structure it as questions, consistently hammer that worldview shift is essential, and offer practical glimpses of a new way. That’s your zone of genius—helping people see with both eyes, so the “Good Life” and “saving the world” aren’t illusions but living realities.\nNo more dithering—go write.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nwhat are some different quotes, traditions, cultures, or books/etc that say this:\n\"\"\"3. Solve the “Worldview Leads to Patterns” Gap\n\nProblem to Address: People keep thinking “If we just do social capitalism instead of normal capitalism, we’ll fix it,” but they fail to realize they’re still adopting the same controlling, exploitative worldview, just re-labeled.\nHow to Solve It in the Book:\nIn Chapter 2 or 4: Show that each new approach (social enterprise, philanthropic capitalism, “green tech”) tries to solve problems within the old worldview.\nUse a Concrete Analogy: The back-pain scenario—switching from social media job to coding job doesn’t fix the underlying posture or worldview about “sitting at a computer all day.”\nDrive Home: “Changing tactics within the same worldview = same results.” Repeatedly highlight that the real pivot is from “seeing nature, people, and self as resources” to “seeing them as living relationships.”\"\"\"\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThis idea—that changing tactics within the same worldview only produces the same results—has been echoed across many traditions, philosophies, and thinkers throughout history. Here are some quotes, traditions, and cultural references that support this argument:\nPhilosophy & Social Critique\nAlbert Einstein (1879–1955)\n“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”\nOne of the most famous articulations of the idea that new solutions require a paradigm shift, not just adjustments within the existing frame.\nMarshall McLuhan (1911–1980)\n“The medium is the message.”\nThe form of a system (capitalism, technology, governance) shapes outcomes more than any specific content within it. Just tweaking the content (e.g., making capitalism \"ethical\") doesn’t change the system’s fundamental logic.\nDavid Graeber (1961–2020)\nHis book Bullshit Jobs shows how modern capitalism creates meaningless work, and how attempts to reform it (e.g., making corporations more \"socially responsible\") still rely on the same logic of economic growth and control over people’s lives.\nThomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 1962)\nKuhn’s concept of paradigm shifts shows that true change doesn’t happen incrementally within an old framework—it requires replacing that framework entirely.\nEastern Philosophy & Wisdom Traditions\nLao Tzu (Tao Te Ching, c. 6th Century BCE)\n“The more laws and restrictions there are, the poorer people become. The sharper men's weapons, the more trouble in the land. The more cunning and cleverness, the more falsehoods appear.”\nTranslation: When we keep using the same mindset (control, laws, fixes), we recreate the same problems in new forms. Only stepping outside the control-based mentality opens new possibilities.\nBuddhism & The Middle Way\nThe Buddha saw that simply switching between indulgence and extreme asceticism wasn’t real liberation—it was just different expressions of attachment. Similarly, switching from extractive capitalism to “green capitalism” without changing the underlying relationship to consumption and domination is still attachment.\nZen Koan:\n“Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.”\nTranslation: The surface tasks might look the same, but when seen through a different awareness, they take on entirely new meaning. Changing external structures without shifting awareness doesn’t lead to transformation.\nIndigenous Wisdom & Systems Thinking\nRobin Wall Kimmerer (Braiding Sweetgrass, 2013)\n“Restoring land without restoring relationship is an empty exercise. It is relationship that will endure and sustain, not the mechanics of the world.”\nTranslation: Just doing sustainable agriculture with the same ownership & exploitation mindset still results in extraction. We need relational change, not just better techniques.\nIndigenous Australian \"Dreaming\" (Tjukurpa)\nAboriginal cultures teach that land, people, and stories are interconnected. Colonizers tried to replace these relationships with private property and “resource management,” which just replicated destruction in new forms rather than restoring balance.\nChristianity & Western Religious Thought\nJesus Christ (Matthew 9:16-17)\n“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.”\nTranslation: You can’t just tweak the old system—it will break. Transformation requires a whole new container.\nThe Protestant Reformation (1517)\nMartin Luther’s problem with the Catholic Church wasn’t just about corruption—it was about a fundamental shift from a priest-mediated faith to direct connection with the divine. Replacing indulgences with different church taxes wouldn’t have changed anything; it was the worldview shift that mattered.\nPolitical & Economic Thought\nIvan Illich (Tools for Conviviality, 1973)\n“People will be caught in a trap unless they reject the dominant mode of production, not just its products.”\nSimply reforming schools, hospitals, and workplaces within the same mechanized logic won’t free people. The system itself needs to be rethought.\nThe French Revolution (1789)\nThe revolution overthrew the monarchy but replaced it with another centralized system (Napoleon, bureaucratic nationalism). Without changing the worldview of power and hierarchy, France just got a new form of domination.\nJames C. Scott (Seeing Like a State, 1998)\nScott shows how top-down planning (even well-intentioned) fails because it applies mechanical thinking to living systems. Big governments and corporations often replicate colonialist mindsets even in their social programs.\nScientific & Systems Thinking\nGregory Bateson (Steps to an Ecology of Mind, 1972)\n“The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and the way people think.”\nTranslation: If we don’t change how we think, all solutions will simply be new manifestations of old problems.\nDonella Meadows (Thinking in Systems, 2008)\n\"You can’t ‘solve’ a system’s problem with the same thinking that created it. You have to shift the paradigm.\"\nMetaphors to Drive It Home\nThe Back Pain Analogy (Work vs. Worldview):\nSwitching from social media marketing to coding doesn’t solve the posture problem—it just relocates the issue. Similarly, switching from capitalist business to “ethical capitalism” keeps the underlying logic of control and extraction intact.\nThe Diet Analogy:\nIf you have a junk-food diet, switching from McDonald's to “organic McDonald's” doesn’t solve the issue. The relationship to food is what must change.\nThe Broken Compass Analogy:\nIf your compass is broken, switching from a speedboat to a sailboat won’t stop you from heading in the wrong direction. You need a new way of navigating, not just a new vessel.\nHow to Integrate These Into the Book\nUse a mix of philosophy, history, and real-world examples to reinforce the idea that worldview change is the real pivot point.\nBring in a punchy metaphor early on (e.g., the back pain or diet analogy) so readers get it intuitively before diving into heavier material.\nEnd a chapter with a \"Test Your Own Worldview\" Reflection:\n“Where in your own life have you tried switching tactics instead of changing the underlying approach?”\n“What problems keep recurring no matter how much effort you put in? Could it be because the deeper framework hasn’t changed?”\nFinal Summary\nThe key takeaway is that tactics (like “social capitalism” or “green energy”) within the same worldview (control, extraction, domination) still produce the same distortions.\nTrue transformation happens when we stop tweaking the same broken model and instead shift to a new paradigm of relationship, recognition, and interconnection."

How These Connect\n\n### Each Pattern Shows:\n1. Original relationship/direct knowing\n2. System of control/measurement\n3. False solutions within same worldview\n4. Living alternatives that exist\n\n### Each Historical Moment Shows:\n1. What was lost\n2. What replaced it\n3. How it shapes current patterns\n4. Paths to recovery\n\n## D. Key Questions to Develop\n\n### For Pattern Triads:\n1. What are your personal examples of each?\n2. Which resonate most with your audience?\n3. How do you teach pattern recognition?\n\n### For Historical Moments:\n1. What primary sources illustrate the shift?\n2. How do you make history relevant?\n3. What recovery paths exist?",

Historical Focus\n**Strengths:**\n- Clear explanation of how we got here\n- Strong intellectual framework\n- Shows systemic patterns\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Could feel too academic\n- Might lose practical relevance\n\n### 2. Question-Driven Structure\n**Strengths:**\n- Natural engagement\n- Clear progression\n- Builds curiosity\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Could feel formulaic\n- Might lose narrative flow\n\n### 3. Pattern Recognition\n**Strengths:**\n- Shows repeating dynamics\n- Practical examples\n- Clear framework\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Needs clearer organization\n- Could feel scattered\n\n### 4. Aliveness Framework\n**Strengths:**\n- Direct connection to experience\n- Clear practice (have-to vs want-to)\n- Hope-driven\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Needs historical grounding\n- Could seem too personal\n\n## Proposed Synthesis: The Aliveness Triad Framework\n\n### Core Structure: Each Chapter Uses Three Elements\n\n1. **Death Pattern** (Current Reality)\n- The have-to pattern\n- Historical roots\n- Systemic manifestation\n- Personal experience\n\n2. **False Solution** (Control Response)\n- The \"better control\" attempt\n- Why it fails\n- Historical examples\n- Modern manifestations\n\n3. **Life Pattern** (Aliveness Alternative)\n- The want-to possibility\n- Living examples\n- Historical wisdom\n- Personal practice\n\n### Book Structure\n\n#### Part I: Seeing the Pattern\n1. **Introduction: The Great Deadening**\n- Death Pattern: Modern alienation\n- False Solution: Tech fixes\n- Life Pattern: Recognition faculty\n\n2. **How We Lost Our Way**\n- Death Pattern: Control worldview\n- False Solution: Better systems\n- Life Pattern: Direct knowing\n\n3. **The Social Impact Trap**\n- Death Pattern: Metrics mania\n- False Solution: Better measurement\n- Life Pattern: Real relationship\n\n#### Part II: Understanding the Pattern\n4. **The Work Pattern**\n- Death Pattern: Resource extraction\n- False Solution: Better jobs\n- Life Pattern: Craft tradition\n\n5. **The Knowledge Pattern**\n- Death Pattern: Information accumulation\n- False Solution: Better data\n- Life Pattern: Wisdom tradition\n\n6. **The Nature Pattern**\n- Death Pattern: Resource management\n- False Solution: Green tech\n- Life Pattern: Living systems\n\n#### Part III: Transforming the Pattern\n7. **Personal Recognition**\n- Death Pattern: Self-optimization\n- False Solution: Better tools\n- Life Pattern: Coming alive\n\n8. **Collective Recognition**\n- Death Pattern: Control structures\n- False Solution: Better management\n- Life Pattern: Living community\n\n9. **Living Future**\n- Death Pattern: Progress mythology\n- False Solution: Better future\n- Life Pattern: Present aliveness\n\n## Why This Synthesis Works\n\n1. **Clear Structure**\n- Triad framework provides organization\n- Historical context grounds understanding\n- Personal practice makes it accessible\n\n2. **Unique Contribution**\n- Integrates pattern recognition with aliveness\n- Shows why solutions fail\n- Offers practical alternative\n\n3. **Practical Impact**\n- Clear practice framework\n- Recognizable patterns\n- Actionable steps\n\n## Three Critical Questions to Refine Further\n\n1. **Pattern Recognition**\nHow can we make the death pattern → false solution → life pattern progression most clear and compelling?\n- Need specific examples\n- Clear transitions\n- Practical recognition tools\n\n2. **Historical Integration**\nHow do we weave historical context without losing momentum?\n- Key moments that show pattern\n- Contemporary relevance\n- Clear connection to practice\n\n3. **Practice Development**\nHow do we make the shift from death to life patterns practical?\n- Recognition exercises\n- Community support\n- Measurable shifts\n\n## Recommendation for Next Steps\n\n1. **Develop Pattern Library**\n- Document clear triads\n- Find historical roots\n- Identify living examples\n\n2. **Create Practice Framework**\n- Design recognition exercises\n- Build support structure\n- Plan community engagement\n\n3. **Write Sample Chapter**\n- Use triad structure\n- Include personal story\n- Show historical connection\n- Offer practical shift\n\n## Questions to Guide Development\n\n1. For each chapter:\n- What's the clearest death pattern?\n- What's the most common false solution?\n- What's the most compelling life pattern?\n\n2. For the framework:\n- How do patterns build on each other?\n- What's the natural progression?\n- How does transformation happen?\n\n3. For impact:\n- Who needs this most?\n- What support do they need?\n- How do we measure change?\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Develop any specific triad in detail?\n2. Explore the practice framework?\n3. Design a sample chapter?",

And I think that's, you know, you talk about the Civil Rights Movement, and yeah, the Civil Rights Movement did have that kind of property. But I'd say that it had that partially because it had a religious connection and that religions are the thing that offer this possibility for acknowledging that there's, like, such thing as wisdom, you know? Such thing as wisdom and an expanded worldview that opens up these new possibilities of being and belonging in a way that's meaningful and that we prefer. But when you first started giving me all of these different ways that things, you know, the Industrial Revolution and all that, I'd say that it's not necessarily related to that. And actually there's a lot of historians that would argue that it's actually something about the kind of European mindset and worldview that is kind of weird in history. Because there were people that also had all of those, you know, wealth and the scientific and technological capacities. But they didn't wind up, you know, colonizing the world. Like, there's that General Qi from China who traveled around the world with, like, thousands and thousands of vessels. And he could have very easily colonized and taken over and exploited people. But that wasn't what he did. He was just adventuring and learning about the world. And I think that is because of the mindset that is different between what he had and what the Europeans have had. And I think it's kind of interesting to think about it from that direction. That it's not really, like, two opposing mindsets or many different mindsets that, you know, we have these, like, progression of ideas. It's more like you have a kind of way of looking that is connected to the things that you find meaningful and beautiful. And what you're looking at is the things that make us feel like we're powerful and we can talk about it. And I kind of wonder what, you know, who in the world are the people we're trying to figure out who are the things that we can study, we can think, might say about this. And I also think that it might be that if we look at the, you know, crafts and the mystical traditions of Master's students, that accessing this worldview is about a process and a practice. Like, every religious and spiritual tradition has things to do to teach us, to learn from it, ways to go about things, to come to the realization that that is what we want. And so I think that the practice element is also super critical. And so it could be interesting to think about what is a worldview when it has a business plan and a practice connected to it.",

              "content": "# Accessing the Expanded Worldview: A Practice-Based Approach\n\n## Key Insight\nWe're not trying to create a new worldview or pit worldviews against each other. Rather, we're recognizing that:\n\n1. There exists an expanded worldview that sees meaning, beauty, and relationship\n2. This worldview is accessible through practice and tradition\n3. Western Europe's \"weird\" path is the exception, not the rule\n4. The path forward is about recognition and practice, not progress or opposition\n\n## Examples That Show This\n\n### General Zheng He vs European Explorers\n- Same technological capability\n- Different worldview led to different actions\n- Not about technology or capability\n- About how you see reality itself\n\n### Religious/Spiritual Traditions\n- Practices for accessing expanded awareness\n- Methods passed through generations\n- Focus on recognition rather than progress\n- Integration of knowing and being\n\n### Craft Traditions\n- Apprenticeship model\n- Direct transmission\n- Practice-based learning\n- Recognition of quality\n\n## Structure This Suggests\n\n### Part I: Recognition\n1. The Already-Present View\n   - Examples across traditions\n   - Signs in our own experience\n   - Why it feels true when encountered\n\n2. Why We Miss It\n   - Not historical progression\n   - Western peculiarity\n   - Current blindness\n\n3. How We Know It's Real\n   - Moments of recognition\n   - Universal human experiences\n   - Living examples\n\n### Part II: Practice\n1. Traditional Approaches\n   - Religious practices\n   - Craft apprenticeship\n   - Indigenous wisdom\n   - Mystical traditions\n\n2. Modern Applications\n   - Personal practice\n   - Organizational possibilities\n   - Social transformation\n   - Economic reimagining\n\n3. The Path of Recognition\n   - Starting where you are\n   - Building capacity\n   - Growing trust\n   - Finding community\n\n### Part III: Living It\n1. Personal Integration\n   - Daily practices\n   - Relationship building\n   - Work transformation\n   - Life alignment\n\n2. Collective Possibilities\n   - Organization design\n   - Economic models\n   - Education approaches\n   - Social impact\n\n3. Ongoing Journey\n   - Continuous practice\n   - Growing recognition\n   - Community support\n   - Natural evolution\n\n## Core Elements\n\n### 1. Recognition vs Creation\n- Not making something new\n- Seeing what's already there\n- Growing capacity to recognize\n- Building trust in perception\n\n### 2. Practice vs Progress\n- Not about getting somewhere\n- About developing capacity\n- Regular engagement\n- Community support\n\n### 3. Tradition vs Innovation\n- Ancient wisdom still relevant\n- Direct transmission important\n- Living examples exist\n- Practice lineages matter\n\n### 4. Integration vs Opposition\n- Not either/or thinking\n- Both/and possibility\n- Natural harmony\n- Organic development\n\n## Key Questions This Raises\n\n1. **For Recognition:**\n- How do we know when we're seeing with expanded view?\n- What practices help develop this recognition?\n- How do traditions support this development?\n\n2. **For Practice:**\n- What practices work best today?\n- How do we adapt traditional methods?\n- What support structures are needed?\n\n3. **For Implementation:**\n- How do organizations embody this?\n- What economic models emerge?\n- How does social change happen?\n\n## Unique Contribution\n\nThis approach:\n1. Centers recognition over creation\n2. Emphasizes practice over progress\n3. Values tradition while being current\n4. Offers practical path forward\n\n## Next Development Needs\n\n1. **Practice Framework**\n- Clear progression\n- Support structures\n- Community elements\n\n2. **Recognition Guidelines**\n- How to notice\n- How to trust\n- How to develop\n\n3. **Implementation Models**\n- Personal practice\n- Organizational design\n- Economic possibilities\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Explore specific practices?\n2. Develop recognition framework?\n3. Design implementation approach?",

Time & Possession\n**Having Mode:**\n- Fixed agreements\n- Expected returns\n- Money making money\n- \"Forever\" ownership\n- Banking metaphysics\n\n**Doing Mode:**\n- Living relationships\n- Gift circulation\n- Present attunement\n- Flowing exchange\n- Craft metaphysics\n\n### 3. Historical Integration\n\n#### Contemplative Traditions\n- Benedictine \"Ora et Labora\" (Prayer and Work)\n- Zen monasteries combining meditation and manual labor\n- Sufi craft guilds\n- Christian desert fathers doing handicrafts\n\n#### Craft Traditions\n- Medieval guild system combining:\n  * Technical skill\n  * Spiritual development\n  * Social organization\n  * Economic function\n\n#### Farming Traditions\n- Monastic gardens\n- Indigenous agricultural practices\n- Seasonal rituals\n- Community harvest festivals\n\n## The Protestant Shift\n\n### Key Changes\n1. Suspicion of unquantifiable experience\n2. Individual interpretation over embodied tradition\n3. Work ethic divorced from contemplative practice\n4. Accumulation as sign of grace\n\n### Effects\n- Split between inner/outer\n- Separation of work/spirit\n- Mistrust of direct experience\n- Elevation of ownership over practice\n\n## Time & Value\n\n### Banking Time\n- Fixed returns\n- Expected future\n- Accumulation focus\n- Individual security\n- Fragile stability\n\n### Living Time\n- Present attention\n- Relational flow\n- Gift circulation\n- Collective resilience\n- Robust adaptability\n\n## The Peasant Question\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Always poor/hungry\n- No cultural richness\n- Pure subsistence\n- Nothing to teach us\n\n### Historical Reality\n- Complex social systems\n- Rich cultural practices\n- Seasonal celebrations\n- Community resilience\n\n### Peasant Revolts\n- Often about maintaining traditional rights\n- Defending commons\n- Protecting social fabric\n- Resisting enclosure\n\n## Integration Examples\n\n### Historical\n1. **Monastic Communities**\n   - Prayer and work integrated\n   - Manual and contemplative practice\n   - Economic and spiritual life unified\n   - Community-based resilience\n\n2. **Craft Guilds**\n   - Technical and spiritual training\n   - Economic and social organization\n   - Intergenerational transmission\n   - Quality recognition development\n\n3. **Agricultural Communities**\n   - Seasonal rhythms\n   - Festival calendars\n   - Community practices\n   - Ecological knowledge\n\n### Contemporary\n1. **New Monasticism**\n   - Urban communities\n   - Integrated practice\n   - Social engagement\n   - Economic experiments\n\n2. **Craft Renaissance**\n   - Maker movements\n   - Apprenticeship revival\n   - Quality focus\n   - Community building\n\n3. **Food Sovereignty**\n   - Local food systems\n   - Traditional knowledge\n   - Community connection\n   - Ecological practice\n\n## Key Insights for Book\n\n### 1. The Split Wasn't Natural\n- Integration was historical norm\n- Split served particular interests\n- Created current crisis\n- Alternative always existed\n\n### 2. Practice Integrates\n- Manual work grounds spirit\n- Craft develops perception\n- Agriculture teaches relationship\n- Community builds resilience\n\n### 3. Time Changes Everything\n- From fixed returns to living relationship\n- From expected future to present attention\n- From individual security to collective resilience\n- From fragile stability to robust adaptability\n\n## Questions to Develop\n\n1. **Historical Investigation**\n- How did contemplative and craft traditions interact?\n- What role did monasteries play in maintaining integration?\n- How did peasant communities maintain resilience?\n\n2. **Practice Framework**\n- How do we reintegrate manual and contemplative practice?\n- What role does craft play in developing perception?\n- How do we build new economic models based on gift and relationship?\n\n3. **Contemporary Application**\n- What modern examples show integration?\n- How do we build new institutions?\n- What supports this transformation?\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Research Directions**\n- Monastic economic practices\n- Craft guild spiritual traditions\n- Peasant revolt documentation\n- Contemporary integration examples\n\n2. **Practice Development**\n- Manual-contemplative integration\n- Community building methods\n- Economic experiments\n- Institutional models\n\n3. **Writing Focus**\n- Clear historical examples\n- Living alternatives\n- Practice framework\n- Implementation guidance",

How did the split between \"having\" (pure, mental, ownership) and \"doing\" (messy, manual, practice) shape our current worldview and its problems? What historical examples best show this?\n\n2. What can we learn from traditions that maintained integration of contemplative practice, manual work, and economic life? How did they do it?\n\n3. How do we build new models that reintegrate these elements while addressing contemporary challenges? What examples show this is possible?\n\nThe connection between craft, contemplation, and community seems crucial - these weren't separate spheres historically, and their separation might be key to our current crisis.\n\nWould you like to explore any of these questions further or take this in a different direction? The historical connection between practice, manual work, and ways of seeing could be a powerful lens for the book.",

Natural Principles vs Artificial Separation\n\n### Natural Principles\n- Entanglement in time (lineage, tradition, cycles)\n- Relationship with materials (wood grain, soil health)\n- Community interdependence\n- Embodied knowledge\n- Gift circulation\n- Seasonal rhythms\n- Quality recognition\n\n### Artificial Separations\n- Linear time (progress, growth)\n- Standardized materials (wood pulp, monocultures)\n- Individual autonomy\n- Abstract knowledge\n- Interest/passive income\n- Constant production\n- Quantitative measurement\n\n## 2. Key Historical Transformations\n\n### Catholic Church\n**Protagonist Role:**\n- Preserved craft traditions\n- Maintained monasteries (ora et labora)\n- Kept gift economy aspects\n- Valued embodied practice\n\n**Antagonist Role:**\n- Introduced hierarchical control\n- Mediated direct experience\n- Centralized authority\n- Standardized practice\n\n### Protestant Reformation\n**Key Shifts:**\n- Individual interpretation over tradition\n- Work ethic divorced from contemplation\n- Accumulation as sign of grace\n- Suspicion of unquantifiable experience\n- Text over embodied practice\n\n### Banking/Interest\n**Transformations:**\n- Wealth disconnected from labor\n- Time commodified\n- Passive ownership valued\n- Inheritance without practice\n- \"Pure\" profit (no messy reality)\n\n### Industrial Revolutions\n**1st Industrial Revolution:**\n- Machine over craft\n- Standardization over relationship\n- Time as commodity\n- Labor as resource\n\n**2nd Industrial Revolution:**\n- Mass production\n- Scientific management\n- Further separation from materials\n- Efficiency over relationship\n\n**3rd Industrial Revolution:**\n- Digital abstraction\n- Information over wisdom\n- Virtual over physical\n- Speed over depth\n\n**4th Industrial Revolution:**\n- AI/automation\n- Complete separation from process\n- Algorithm over insight\n- Control over relationship\n\n## 3. Pattern Analysis\n\n### What We're Losing\n1. **Time Relationship:**\n   - Cyclical → Linear\n   - Present-focused → Future-focused\n   - Seasonal → Constant\n   - Embedded → Extracted\n\n2. **Material Relationship:**\n   - Direct engagement → Standardization\n   - Working with → Control over\n   - Quality recognition → Quantity measurement\n   - Craft knowledge → Technical specs\n\n3. **Social Relationship:**\n   - Community → Individual\n   - Gift → Transaction\n   - Obligation → Freedom\n   - Interdependence → Autonomy\n\n4. **Knowledge Transmission:**\n   - Apprenticeship → Information\n   - Embodied → Abstract\n   - Practice → Theory\n   - Direct → Mediated\n\n## 4. The Freedom Paradox\n\n### The American Dream\n- Freedom from obligation\n- Individual autonomy\n- Constant innovation\n- Disruption as good\n\n### The Hidden Cost\n- Loss of belonging\n- Isolation\n- Rootlessness\n- Meaninglessness\n\n## 5. Against Natural Principles\n\n### Time\n**Natural:**\n- Cycles\n- Seasons\n- Generations\n- Present-focused\n\n**Artificial:**\n- Linear progress\n- Constant production\n- Individual lifespan\n- Future-focused\n\n### Space\n**Natural:**\n- Local adaptation\n- Place-based knowledge\n- Community bonds\n- Ecological relationship\n\n**Artificial:**\n- Standardization\n- Abstract knowledge\n- Individual mobility\n- Resource extraction\n\n### Relationship\n**Natural:**\n- Interdependence\n- Gift circulation\n- Quality recognition\n- Embodied practice\n\n**Artificial:**\n- Independence\n- Transaction\n- Quantity measurement\n- Abstract theory\n\n## 6. The Innovation Problem\n\n### Disruptive Innovation\n- Manufactured needs\n- Planned obsolescence\n- Constant change\n- Progress mythology\n\n### Natural Innovation\n- Genuine needs\n- Durable solutions\n- Organic evolution\n- Wisdom accumulation\n\n## Critical Questions\n\n1. How did we come to see \"freedom from obligation\" as desirable rather than tragic?\n\n2. Why does the Protestant/Capitalist worldview feel like progress when it violates natural principles?\n\n3. What made the Western European path so uniquely destructive of relationship and meaning?\n\n4. How do we distinguish genuine innovation serving life from disruption serving profit?\n\n5. Can we reintegrate without returning to hierarchy and control?\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Research Directions:**\n- Medieval guild practices\n- Monastic economics\n- Peasant revolt documents\n- Indigenous economic systems\n\n2. **Pattern Analysis:**\n- Map transformations\n- Identify key moments\n- Show alternatives\n- Find living examples\n\n3. **Framework Development:**\n- Natural principles\n- Practice integration\n- Community building\n- Economic alternatives",

              "content": "# The American Acceleration & Our Core Questions\n\n## 1. Beyond the \"Golden Age\" Trap\n\n### Why Institutions Are Complex\nThe Catholic Church example shows how institutions can simultaneously:\n- Preserve craft traditions while creating hierarchy\n- Maintain gift economies while centralizing power\n- Value embodied practice while controlling access\n- Keep wisdom alive while mediating experience\n\n### What This Tells Us\n- Change isn't linear degradation\n- Institutions both preserve and transform\n- Power structures can protect and destroy\n- We need nuanced understanding\n\n### Key Insight\nThe issue isn't returning to a \"golden age\" but understanding how relationships to meaning/practice transform. Some elements persist even as frameworks change.\n\n## 2. The Western European Peculiarity\n\n### What Made It Different\n- Separation of mind/body (Cartesian dualism)\n- Individual salvation (Protestant theology)\n- Linear time (Christian apocalyptic thinking)\n- Nature as resource (Scientific Revolution)\n\n### Why Others Didn't Follow This Path\n- Chinese civilization: Harmony with nature\n- Islamic Golden Age: Integration of science/spirit\n- Indigenous cultures: Relational worldview\n- Traditional societies: Cyclic understanding\n\n### Key Insight\nThe Western path combined unique elements:\n- Religious individualism\n- Scientific materialism\n- Linear progress\n- Control orientation\n\n## 3. Working with Natural Principles\n\n### What They Are\n- Cyclical time\n- Relational knowing\n- Embodied practice\n- Gift circulation\n- Quality recognition\n\n### How to Work with Them\n- Not through rigid rules\n- Not through romanticizing\n- Through practice and recognition\n- Through community support\n\n### Key Insight\nNatural principles are discovered through practice, not imposed through theory. They emerge from relationship rather than control.\n\n## 4. The American Acceleration\n\n### The Immigrant Vacuum\n- Traditions partially preserved\n- Community contexts lost\n- Festivals disappeared\n- Lineage weakened\n- Practice without framework\n\n### What Filled the Vacuum\n- National identity\n- Military power\n- Economic \"success\"\n- Technological progress\n- Individual achievement\n\n### The Measurement Trap\n- Created our own metrics\n- Optimized for them\n- Declared victory\n- Lost other measures\n\n### Key Effects\n1. **Speed of Transformation**\n   - Traditional breakdown accelerated\n   - New forms rapidly adopted\n   - Old wisdom lost faster\n   - Novel experiments privileged\n\n2. **Depth of Disconnection**\n   - Family traditions fragmented\n   - Community bonds broken\n   - Place-based knowledge lost\n   - Practice contexts disappeared\n\n3. **New Religion of Progress**\n   - Technology as salvation\n   - Growth as good\n   - Innovation as goal\n   - Disruption as virtue\n\n## 5. Implications for Today\n\n### Why We Feel \"Successful\"\n1. **Created the Measuring Stick**\n   - GDP as progress\n   - Military power as strength\n   - Technology as advancement\n   - Individual wealth as success\n\n2. **Optimized for Our Metrics**\n   - Economic growth at all costs\n   - Military dominance\n   - Technological \"disruption\"\n   - Personal accumulation\n\n3. **Ignored Other Measures**\n   - Community resilience\n   - Cultural continuity\n   - Ecological health\n   - Relational wealth\n\n### The Hidden Costs\n1. **Personal**\n   - Meaninglessness\n   - Isolation\n   - Anxiety\n   - Rootlessness\n\n2. **Collective**\n   - Environmental crisis\n   - Social fragmentation\n   - Cultural poverty\n   - Spiritual emptiness\n\n3. **Systemic**\n   - Brittle systems\n   - Dependent on growth\n   - Cannot adapt\n   - No deep roots\n\n## 6. Path Forward\n\n### Recognition\n- See the pattern\n- Understand the vacuum\n- Notice what's missing\n- Feel the loss\n\n### Recovery\n- Find living traditions\n- Build new practices\n- Create community\n- Restore relationship\n\n### Integration\n- Neither past nor future\n- Both tradition and innovation\n- Personal and collective\n- Practice and understanding\n\n## Key Questions for Further Exploration\n\n1. How do we build genuine culture without falling into nationalism or individualism?\n\n2. What role can partial traditions play in rebuilding relationship and meaning?\n\n3. How do we measure real success while living in current systems?\n\n4. What practices support this transformation without creating new forms of control?\n\n## Critical Insight\n\nThe American experiment represents an acceleration of trends already present in European transformation, but with:\n- Faster disconnection from tradition\n- Greater emphasis on individual\n- Stronger focus on \"progress\"\n- Deeper loss of context\n\nThis makes America both the extreme example of separation and potentially the place where new integration might emerge - precisely because the loss is so complete and the need so clear.",

              "content": "# America's Unique Pattern: Immigration, Assimilation & Loss\n\n## 1. Different Models of Immigration\n\n### American \"Melting Pot\"\n- Complete assimilation expected\n- Past traditions seen as burden\n- Success = letting go\n- \"New beginning\" mythology\n- Individual over collective\n\n### British Multiculturalism\n- Communities maintain identity\n- Traditions preserved\n- Multiple cultures coexist\n- Less pressure to assimilate\n- Community structures remain\n\n### French Universalism\n- Similar to American model\n- \"French values\" paramount\n- Individual citizenship emphasized\n- Cultural erasure expected\n- Republic over community\n\n## 2. The American Dream's Hidden Costs\n\n### What Drew People\n- Economic opportunity\n- Individual freedom\n- Fresh start\n- Escape from old hierarchies\n- \"Anyone can make it\"\n\n### What They Had to Give Up\n- Community traditions\n- Cultural practices\n- Relational networks\n- Generational wisdom\n- Ways of seeing\n\n### The Unacknowledged Loss\n- Meaning structures\n- Community support\n- Traditional knowledge\n- Quality recognition\n- Relationship patterns\n\n## 3. The Acceleration Effect\n\n### Why America Accelerated Disconnection\n1. **Clean Break from Past**\n   - Ocean separation\n   - New territory\n   - Fresh identity\n   - Future focus\n\n2. **Success Required Assimilation**\n   - English language\n   - Protestant work ethic\n   - Individual achievement\n   - Material measures\n\n3. **Loss of Context**\n   - No sacred places\n   - No community festivals\n   - No seasonal rhythms\n   - No craft lineages\n\n## 4. The Indigenous Paradox\n\n### Complex Relationships\n1. **Recognition**\n   - Some saw indigenous wisdom\n   - Attracted to their way of life\n   - Sensed what was missing\n   - Felt the contrast\n\n2. **Rejection**\n   - Seen as \"primitive\"\n   - Threat to progress\n   - Cultural elimination\n   - Land appropriation\n\n### Key Examples\n- Benjamin Franklin's admiration of Haudenosaunee\n- Thoreau's writings on Native Americans\n- Early settlers \"going native\"\n- Modern environmental movement\n\n## 5. Cultural Retention vs. Success\n\n### What Survived\n- Food traditions\n- Family celebrations\n- Religious practices\n- Cultural values\n\n### What Was Lost\n- Community context\n- Practice frameworks\n- Quality recognition\n- Relationship patterns\n- Wisdom transmission\n\n### The Trade-off\n- Success meant assimilation\n- Preservation meant marginalization\n- Middle ground was rare\n- Cultural loss accelerated\n\n## 6. Ground Zero for Ecological Crisis\n\n### Why America Led the Way\n1. **Blank Slate Mentality**\n   - No sacred places\n   - No traditional limits\n   - Resource mindset\n   - Progress ideology\n\n2. **Success Metrics**\n   - GDP growth\n   - Resource extraction\n   - Technological progress\n   - Individual wealth\n\n3. **Loss of Traditional Wisdom**\n   - No ecological knowledge\n   - No relationship patterns\n   - No seasonal attunement\n   - No quality recognition\n\n## 7. Research Directions\n\n### Historical Analysis\n- Immigration patterns\n- Assimilation policies\n- Cultural retention studies\n- Success metrics\n\n### Comparative Studies\n- American vs. European immigration\n- Different ethnic groups\n- Retention patterns\n- Success measures\n\n### Indigenous Relations\n- Early interactions\n- Knowledge transfer\n- Cultural conflicts\n- Modern reconception\n\n## 8. Contemporary Implications\n\n### Current Tensions\n- Rootlessness\n- Meaninglessness\n- Environmental crisis\n- Social fragmentation\n\n### Emerging Responses\n- Cultural reclamation\n- Indigenous wisdom\n- New community forms\n- Practice recovery\n\n### Key Questions\n1. Can we rebuild meaning without falling into nationalism?\n2. How do we recover wisdom without appropriation?\n3. What new forms of community are possible?\n4. How do we measure real success?\n\n## 9. The Path Forward\n\n### Recognition\n- Acknowledge the loss\n- Understand the pattern\n- See the consequences\n- Feel the absence\n\n### Recovery\n- Find living traditions\n- Build new practices\n- Create community\n- Restore relationship\n\n### Integration\n- New forms of belonging\n- Cultural regeneration\n- Ecological wisdom\n- Quality recognition\n\n## Critical Insight\n\nAmerica's unique immigration pattern created:\n- Fastest disconnection from tradition\n- Clearest example of progress ideology\n- Most extreme ecological damage\n- Greatest need for new integration\n\nThis makes America both the epicenter of the crisis and potentially the laboratory for new solutions - precisely because the loss is so complete and the need so clear.",
