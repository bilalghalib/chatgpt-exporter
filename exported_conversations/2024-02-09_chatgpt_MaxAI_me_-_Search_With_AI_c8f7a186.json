      "content": "To sort MongoDB alphabetically in a case-insensitive manner:\n\n1. Create a new field containing lowercased values of the field you want to sort. This involves duplicating the existing field and applying a lowercase transformation to its values [[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22931177/case-insensitive-sorting-in-mongodb)].\n2. Alternatively, use collations or aggregations to specify case-insensitive sorting directly in your queries [[2](https://www.baeldung.com/java-mongodb-case-insensitive-sorting)].\n   \nThese methods ensure that sorting is performed without considering the case of the characters, providing the desired case-insensitive sorting functionality in MongoDB.",
