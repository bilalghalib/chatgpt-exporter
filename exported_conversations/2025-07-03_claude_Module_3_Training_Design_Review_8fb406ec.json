  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is working as an education consultant for the ITC, developing Module 3 training for junior architects in Mosul focused on sustainable heritage design. They collaborated with Claude as a pedagogical designer to review and improve their 5-day training program, incorporating feedback from interviews with Wifaq Ahmed and other stakeholders. The user emphasized creating a \"learn-apply-sell\" cycle that would help participants develop practical skills for implementing sustainable design features while addressing cultural resistance from senior architects who view such approaches as difficult to sell.\n\nThroughout the conversation, the user demonstrated clear preferences for practical, interactive learning over theoretical approaches. They consistently pushed for real-world applications, including actual client work, supplier phone calls, and tangible physical outputs participants could take home. The user showed strong commitment to leveraging local resources, particularly Beit Turath al Mosul (a heritage house serving as the training venue), and emphasized grounding the training in Iraqi business practices and cultural context. They preferred framing sustainability in terms of \"comfort and cost\" rather than \"green\" benefits, recognizing this resonates better with local clients.\n\nThe user worked through multiple iterations of the curriculum structure, ultimately settling on a 5-day program with rotating leadership roles (groups of 4 people, 5 groups total) where participants work on one real client project throughout the week. They incorporated feedback from Larsa about adding soft skills training, ventilation design basics, and space constraint solutions for small plots. The final design includes daily social media challenges, hands-on material testing, supplier negotiations, and culminates in a public showcase leading to a design competition held one month later. The user emphasized creating a complete \"pitch kit\" that graduates could use immediately in their professional practice, connecting the training directly to job opportunities and career advancement in sustainable architecture.",

Review Wifaq Ahmed's follow-up interview for new adaptations\n7. Return a structured plan for iteration\n8. Ask 5 clarifying questions about their priorities\n\nFirst, I need to search for these documents in the project knowledge since the user has uploaded them.I'll help you review and improve your Module 3 training materials. Let me first search for and analyze the documents you've mentioned.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nI found the module 3 day 1-5 slides and text. Let me now search for the interviews to understand what was suggested.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nLet me also search for more interviews or feedback documents to get a comprehensive view.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nNow I have a comprehensive view of the materials. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. The Module 3 training covers 5 days with a \"Learn-Apply-Sell\" rhythm each day\n2. The interviews show Wifaq's feedback and suggestions\n3. I need to assess quality, structure, concept, and relevance from the interviews\n\nFrom the interviews, I can see several key insights:\n- Wifaq suggested that 5 hours per day is good\n- He mentioned that participants' attention tends to fade after the first 1.5-2 hours\n- He suggested simplifying topics and not cramming too much into 5 days\n- He recommended including practical elements like BOQ (Bill of Quantities) training\n- He suggested incorporating soft skills like empathy and trust-building\n- He recommended using digital tools like TikTok/Instagram for marketing\n- He emphasized the importance of making trainees leave their comfort zone\n- He suggested a design workshop/competition for day 6\n\nLet me provide a comprehensive analysis and ask clarifying questions.Based on my analysis of your Module 3 training materials and Wifaq's interviews, I'll provide a comprehensive review focusing on quality, structure, concept, and relevance, then propose an iteration plan.\n\n## Current Training Analysis\n\n### **What Was Suggested in Interviews**\n\nFrom Wifaq's feedback, several key recommendations emerged:\n\n1. **Time Management**: He emphasized that participant attention peaks in the first 1.5-2 hours, suggesting more dynamic activities afterward\n2. **Practical Skills**: Strong emphasis on BOQ creation, unit pricing, and cost calculations\n3. **Digital Marketing**: Integration of social media (TikTok/Instagram) for market outreach\n4. **Soft Skills**: Adding empathy mapping, negotiation skills, and trust-building components\n5. **Physical Samples**: Using actual material samples (foam, cork, Isocam) for hands-on learning\n6. **Site Visits**: Incorporating field trips to construction sites in Mosul\n7. **Competition Element**: A day 6 design competition bringing together different training cohorts\n\n### **What Was Successfully Included**\n\nYour current slides show strong implementation of:\n\n✅ **Learn-Apply-Sell Structure**: Each day follows this clear rhythm\n✅ **Digital Content Creation**: Day 4-5 focus on video creation, social media marketing\n✅ **ROI Calculations**: Integrated throughout with practical exercises\n✅ **Material Testing**: Hands-on demos with heat lamps and material samples\n✅ **Client Psychology**: Status vs. comfort pitch battles\n✅ **Local Context**: Mosul-specific examples and heritage solutions\n✅ **Peer Learning**: Reflection walls, group rotations, pitch battles\n\n### **What's Missing or Needs Enhancement**\n\nBased on Wifaq's suggestions:\n\n❌ **Site Visits**: No mention of actual field trips to construction sites\n❌ **Supplier Engagement**: Limited real-world supplier interaction (only one phone call exercise)\n❌ **BOQ Deep Dive**: While mentioned, needs more structured training time\n❌ **Mind Mapping**: Wifaq suggested this as a creativity tool - not evident\n❌ **Extended Design Time**: Current structure may rush the design process\n\n## Assessment Against Learn-Apply-Sell Cycle\n\nThe training effectively follows this structure, but there's room for improvement:\n\n- **Learn blocks** (45-60 min): Well-structured but perhaps too theory-heavy\n- **Apply blocks** (60-90 min): Good hands-on activities but could use more real-world simulation\n- **Sell blocks** (30-45 min): Strong pitch practice but needs more market validation\n\n## Five Questions to Refine Your Priorities\n\nBefore proposing specific iterations, I need to understand your constraints and priorities:\n\n1. **Flexibility Question**: Are you locked into the 5-day format, or could we redistribute content differently? For instance, could some theory be pre-work, allowing more hands-on time during the training?\n\n2. **Resources Question**: What's your capacity for organizing site visits or bringing in real suppliers/contractors as guest speakers? This would significantly enhance the practical relevance.\n\n3. **Technology Question**: Wifaq mentioned digital simulation requires powerful laptops - what's your participants' tech capability? Should we scale back Rhino/Ladybug in favor of simpler tools?\n\n4. **Follow-up Question**: Is the Day 6 competition Wifaq mentioned still planned? How does ongoing support work after the 5 days - is there a WhatsApp group or mentorship component?\n\n5. **Outcome Priority**: What's more important for your participants - being able to immediately implement small projects (like roof insulation) or having the skills to design comprehensive heritage-sensitive buildings? This affects how deep vs. broad we go.\n\n## Initial Recommendations Based on Current Analysis\n\nLike a thermally-optimized building that balances mass and ventilation, your training needs to balance information density with practical application. Here's my initial thinking:\n\nThe current structure is like trying to insulate a whole building at once - comprehensive but potentially overwhelming. Consider treating each day like optimizing a different building component: Day 1 for foundations (understanding problems), Day 2 for walls (courtyard solutions), Day 3 for materials (insulation choices), Day 4 for systems (digital tools), and Day 5 for the roof (bringing it all together with marketing).\n\nOne concern: participants might be drinking from a fire hose, especially on Days 1 and 4 where conceptual load is highest. Wifaq's right about the attention span issue.\n\nLet me know your answers to these questions, and I'll provide a detailed iteration plan that maintains your learn-apply-sell rhythm while incorporating Wifaq's valuable insights.",

Welcome to Module 3, Day 1: Green Architecture & Heritage-Inspired Design.”\n[0:20]\u000b Introduce yourself with your 1-liner:\u000b “My name is [Your Name], and I help families sleep upstairs again.”\u000b (Pause)\n[0:40]\u000b Explain the Flash-Round:\u000b “Now let’s learn names and reasons we’re here. We’ll do a quick ‘Who I help … & why’ round. Please stand in a circle.”\n[1:00]\u000b Model the first turn:\u000b “I’ll start. Pop! I’m [Your Name]—I help families sleep upstairs again, by designing homes that stay cool without noisy generators.”\u000b (Ring the little bell.)\n[1:20]\u000b Run the Flash-Round:\u000b “When you hear the bell, it’s time to pass it. You’ll have 12 seconds each—just enough time for your name and one short phrase: who you help and why.”\n[1:40]\u000b Prompt and manage time:\u000b “Ready? Here we go—Pop! [Point to someone next to you].”\u000b (Ring bell at 12 s intervals, gently encourage brevity: “Great, thank you—next!”)\n[3:30]\u000b After 8–10 participants, close:\u000b “Fantastic—thank you all! Now we know who we’re designing for and why. Let’s move on to today’s journey.”\n(Proceed to next slide.)\n\nMosul’s Double-Pain\n*Wet Walls in Winter (mould)” photo\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n[0:00]\u000b “Now let’s ground ourselves in Mosul’s realities—our double-pain seasons.”\n[0:10]\u000b Point to left image (summer heat):\u000b “Last July, temperatures topped 49 °C—homes become ovens. How do you imagine sleeping through that?”\n[0:30]\u000b Point to right image (winter damp):\u000b “Then in winter, we battle humid walls and mould that eats paint and memories. It’s a different kind of cold misery.”\n[0:45]\u000b Engage the group:\u000b “Turn to your neighbor and share in one word: ‘What does this feel like?’”\u000b (Pause 30 s for pair-share; invite 2–3 quick responses.)\n[1:15]\u000b Bridge to safety and homework:\u000b “Tomorrow evening, you’ll photograph your own roof for our shading study—remember our ladder rule. Tonight: climb safely at a 4:1 ratio and keep both hands free.”\n[1:30]\u000b “Great—let’s see how heritage-inspired design can ease both these pains.”\n(Proceed to next slide.)\n\n3 Micro-Stories: Real Impact from Mosul\nWifaq: 17 °C of Comfort\nFatima: Bridge of Renewal\nLaith: Building Trust, One Referral at a Time\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n“Now let me share three real-life examples of how heritage-inspired design is changing lives in Mosul.\nFirst, Over the last year, Fatima co-founded a grassroots heritage foundation after completing ICCROM’s Mosul training. With just two heritage grants, she and her team restored two of the four historic qunatra (“bridges”) spanning the Old City—reviving not only stone arches but community pride.",

Big round of applause!\"\nKey Additions:\nThis creates a bridge to Day 4’s digital storytelling and client deck development.\nIt reinforces that physical samples are part of both learning and sales conversation.\nThe pitch revision will prep them for client-focused presentations on Day 5.\n\nQuick Recap \nShare one ΔT you recorded in yesterday’s heat-lamp demo\nName your favorite material (Good/Better/Best) and why\nDay 4\n00:15 – Quick Recap (10 min)]\u000b Purpose : Reactivate yesterday’s hands-on findings and sales insights to prime Day 4’s digital workflows\nSetup :\nPhysical arrangement – Participants stay in their small groups but face forward\nMaterials needed – Bell or chime, visible timer, sticky-notes & pens at each table\nPre-activity checks – Ensure everyone has yesterday’s ROI printout or screenshot\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Good morning! Let’s quickly pull forward yesterday’s advances before we dig into software. I’ll ring the bell, then in your table groups share one item per prompt. Keep each under eight seconds, and let’s hear from as many tables as we can.”\nKey Points ::\nΔT recall – Connect physical demos to performance metrics\nMaterial choice – Reinforce the Good/Better/Best framework\nBudget pitch – Tie cost modeling to persuasive messaging\nLocal example ::\u000b “Remember when Team 2 spotted that 8 °C drop with cork? That’s the kind of data that wins a client’s trust in Mosul’s heat.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nRing bell → Table 1 shares their ΔT result\nNext bell → Table 2 names their favorite assembly and reason\nNext bell → Table 3 cites one top budget argument\nContinue rotating through tables until time’s up (aim for 4–5 tables)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Tables go off-topic\nSolution: Gently steer back: “Great example—now keep it to the prompt.”\nIssue: One table dominates\nSolution: Pause, invite the next table: “Thanks, now over to Table 4.”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Fantastic—those insights ground us in real numbers and client needs. Now, before our software deep-dive, does anyone have a burning question from Day 3?”\n\nYour Questions Answered\nDay 4\n00:25 Facilitator notes (10 minutes):\nSet the Stage (20 s):\u000b “Before we dive into Day 4, let’s wrap up yesterday.

Let’s go!”\n\nIce-Breaker: “Insulation Relay”\nDay 3\n00:30 - 00:40 – Ice-Breaker – Insulation Relay (10 min)\u000b Purpose: Quickly engage the group with hands-on familiarity of our three material options, reinforcing their relative R-value performance.\nSetup:\nArrange three distinct sample pieces (foam block, cork tile, Isocam membrane) at the front.\u000b\nAsk participants to form three lines (or rows) facing forward.\u000b\nEnsure open space for safe passing.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Okay everyone, it’s time to wake up our senses! We’ve got three insulation samples: foam, cork, and Isocam.”\u000b\n“Each line will pass the samples one by one down the row. When the last person receives all three, they must shout in order: ‘Good, Better, Best.’”\u000b\n“And what do those terms map to?” (Wait for answers: Good = foam, Better = cork, Best = Isocam.)\u000b\n“Exactly—foam is good, cork is better, and Isocam is best for our climate.”\u000b\n“Ready? On my whistle, start passing!” (Blow whistle.)\u000b\nAfter first round: “Great—foam felt thinnest and lightest, cork was denser, and Isocam felt like a solid membrane—just as expected.”\u000b\n“Let’s do one more round for speed!” (Repeat once if time allows.)\u000b\nKey Points:\nFoam offers basic insulation—lightweight but lowest R-value.\u000b\nCork boosts performance with natural thermal mass.\u000b\nIsocam membrane delivers top-tier performance for extreme heat.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “Remember how Fatima’s renovation used Cork in the attic and cut roof heat by 10 °C? That ‘better’ step made a real difference.”\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Samples get dropped or confused.\u000b Solution: Pause, re-label each sample clearly, and restart quickly.\u000b\nIssue: Some participants don’t hear the order.\u000b Solution: Hold up a small flash-card with the words “Good,” “Better,” “Best” during the exercise.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Well done! Having felt those differences, let’s look at our Day 3 agenda so you know what’s next.”\n\nDaily Agenda \n(3-Block Rhythm)\nDay 3\nFacilitator notes:\nBefore we dive into today’s content, I want to show you the heartbeat of our entire training: the 3-Block Rhythm.\n📘 LEARN (First Block)\nWhat it is: A focused theory segment where we introduce concepts, review real data, and demo key techniques.\nWhy it matters: This gives you the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind every tool and calculation you’ll use.\nHow long: Roughly 45–60 minutes each morning.",

            "text": "Based on my analysis of your Module 3 training materials and Wifaq's interviews, I'll provide a comprehensive review focusing on quality, structure, concept, and relevance, then propose an iteration plan.\n\n## Current Training Analysis\n\n### **What Was Suggested in Interviews**\n\nFrom Wifaq's feedback, several key recommendations emerged:\n\n1. **Time Management**: He emphasized that participant attention peaks in the first 1.5-2 hours, suggesting more dynamic activities afterward\n2. **Practical Skills**: Strong emphasis on BOQ creation, unit pricing, and cost calculations\n3. **Digital Marketing**: Integration of social media (TikTok/Instagram) for market outreach\n4. **Soft Skills**: Adding empathy mapping, negotiation skills, and trust-building components\n5. **Physical Samples**: Using actual material samples (foam, cork, Isocam) for hands-on learning\n6. **Site Visits**: Incorporating field trips to construction sites in Mosul\n7. **Competition Element**: A day 6 design competition bringing together different training cohorts\n\n### **What Was Successfully Included**\n\nYour current slides show strong implementation of:\n\n✅ **Learn-Apply-Sell Structure**: Each day follows this clear rhythm\n✅ **Digital Content Creation**: Day 4-5 focus on video creation, social media marketing\n✅ **ROI Calculations**: Integrated throughout with practical exercises\n✅ **Material Testing**: Hands-on demos with heat lamps and material samples\n✅ **Client Psychology**: Status vs. comfort pitch battles\n✅ **Local Context**: Mosul-specific examples and heritage solutions\n✅ **Peer Learning**: Reflection walls, group rotations, pitch battles\n\n### **What's Missing or Needs Enhancement**\n\nBased on Wifaq's suggestions:\n\n❌ **Site Visits**: No mention of actual field trips to construction sites\n❌ **Supplier Engagement**: Limited real-world supplier interaction (only one phone call exercise)\n❌ **BOQ Deep Dive**: While mentioned, needs more structured training time\n❌ **Mind Mapping**: Wifaq suggested this as a creativity tool - not evident\n❌ **Extended Design Time**: Current structure may rush the design process\n\n## Assessment Against Learn-Apply-Sell Cycle\n\nThe training effectively follows this structure, but there's room for improvement:\n\n- **Learn blocks** (45-60 min): Well-structured but perhaps too theory-heavy\n- **Apply blocks** (60-90 min): Good hands-on activities but could use more real-world simulation\n- **Sell blocks** (30-45 min): Strong pitch practice but needs more market validation\n\n## Five Questions to Refine Your Priorities\n\nBefore proposing specific iterations, I need to understand your constraints and priorities:\n\n1. **Flexibility Question**: Are you locked into the 5-day format, or could we redistribute content differently? For instance, could some theory be pre-work, allowing more hands-on time during the training?\n\n2. **Resources Question**: What's your capacity for organizing site visits or bringing in real suppliers/contractors as guest speakers? This would significantly enhance the practical relevance.\n\n3. **Technology Question**: Wifaq mentioned digital simulation requires powerful laptops - what's your participants' tech capability? Should we scale back Rhino/Ladybug in favor of simpler tools?\n\n4. **Follow-up Question**: Is the Day 6 competition Wifaq mentioned still planned? How does ongoing support work after the 5 days - is there a WhatsApp group or mentorship component?\n\n5. **Outcome Priority**: What's more important for your participants - being able to immediately implement small projects (like roof insulation) or having the skills to design comprehensive heritage-sensitive buildings? This affects how deep vs. broad we go.\n\n## Initial Recommendations Based on Current Analysis\n\nLike a thermally-optimized building that balances mass and ventilation, your training needs to balance information density with practical application. Here's my initial thinking:\n\nThe current structure is like trying to insulate a whole building at once - comprehensive but potentially overwhelming. Consider treating each day like optimizing a different building component: Day 1 for foundations (understanding problems), Day 2 for walls (courtyard solutions), Day 3 for materials (insulation choices), Day 4 for systems (digital tools), and Day 5 for the roof (bringing it all together with marketing).\n\nOne concern: participants might be drinking from a fire hose, especially on Days 1 and 4 where conceptual load is highest. Wifaq's right about the attention span issue.\n\nLet me know your answers to these questions, and I'll provide a detailed iteration plan that maintains your learn-apply-sell rhythm while incorporating Wifaq's valuable insights.",

      "content": "This is great context. Let me process this:\n\n1. They have 5 days + 1 competition day (a month later). The competition will involve senior architects as judges - this is smart for culture change.\n\n2. They'll host at Beit Turath al Musul - perfect for demonstrating heritage = sustainable. This addresses the site visit issue.\n\n3. Participants are architects with laptops - so digital tools are feasible.\n\n4. WhatsApp group + Mosul Space events = ongoing support structure.\n\n5. Key outcome: Skills + culture change. Not just technical skills but changing mindsets of both junior architects AND senior firm leaders. The social media component is about broader cultural shift.\n\nThe user wants to create a movement, not just train individuals. The metaphor about \"heritage design is sustainable design\" - building before electricity - is powerful.\n\nNow I need to:\n1. Review the current structure against these goals\n2. Identify where culture change elements can be strengthened\n3. Ensure the training builds toward the competition effectively\n4. Focus on practical selling skills that address senior architects' skepticism\n5. Leverage the heritage venue throughout\n\nKey insight: The training is as much about changing hearts and minds as teaching technical skills. The \"hard to sell\" perception from senior architects is the real barrier to overcome.Excellent context! Now I understand the bigger picture - this isn't just skills training, it's a culture change initiative. Like transforming Mosul's architectural DNA from the inside out.\n\nBased on your answers, here's my comprehensive iteration plan:\n\n## Revised Module 3 Structure: \"Heritage as Innovation\"\n\n### **Overarching Theme Adjustment**\nFrame the entire training as \"Rediscovering Mosul's Architectural Genius\" - position participants as innovators reviving proven solutions, not just learning \"green\" techniques. This counters the senior architects' \"hard to sell\" perception.\n\n### **Day-by-Day Iterations**\n\n#### **Day 1: Foundation & Inspiration**\n*Current*: Heavy on problems and principles\n*Proposed Changes*:\n- **Morning at Beit Turath**: Start with a guided heritage building tour, experiencing firsthand how courtyards cool, mashrabiyas shade, and thick walls insulate\n- **Live Thermal Imaging**: Use IR cameras to show temperature differences in real-time at the heritage site\n- **Senior Architect Panel** (new): Invite 2-3 respected senior architects who've successfully sold heritage-inspired projects to share their stories (countering the \"hard to sell\" myth)\n- **Homework Enhancement**: Besides roof photos, ask participants to interview one elder about pre-electricity cooling methods (creates content for social media)\n\n#### **Day 2: Courtyard Mastery**\n*Current*: Good structure but needs more selling focus\n*Proposed Changes*:\n- **Client Role-Play Enhancement**: Use actual client objections collected from senior architects\n- **Instagram Moment**: Design a \"before/after\" thermal comparison post during the cardboard model exercise\n- **Add Mini-Module**: \"Translating Heritage for Modern Clients\" - specific language that resonates with different client types (status-seekers, cost-conscious, comfort-focused)\n\n#### **Day 3: Materials & Money**\n*Current*: Technical focus on materials\n*Proposed Changes*:\n- **Supplier Speed Dating** (new): Bring 3-4 actual suppliers for 15-minute rotations where teams practice negotiation\n- **BOQ Masterclass**: Expand this section with a real contractor walking through common pricing tricks and how to avoid them\n- **WhatsApp Moment**: Teams share their material sandwich photos with cost comparisons\n\n#### **Day 4: Digital Storytelling**\n*Current*: Software-heavy\n*Proposed Changes*:\n- **Simplify Software**: Focus on one key visualization (before/after heat map) rather than complex modeling\n- **Content Creation Lab Enhancement**: \n  - Morning: Create content WITH senior architects (interview them about their concerns)\n  - Afternoon: Address those concerns in your marketing materials\n- **Viral Challenge**: Launch a hashtag like #MosulCoolsNaturally with the day's best clips\n\n#### **Day 5: Market Activation**\n*Current*: Good structure\n*Proposed Changes*:\n- **Boss Pitch Practice**: Specifically practice pitching to skeptical senior architects (role-played by trainers)\n- **Live Market Test**: Teams go to nearby cafes/shops with their materials and practice real pitches for 30 minutes\n- **Competition Launch**: End day with formal announcement of design competition rules, judging criteria weighted toward \"sellability\"\n\n### **New Elements Throughout**\n\n1. **Daily \"Culture Change\" Moments**:\n   - Start each day sharing one social media post that got engagement\n   - End each day with teams posting one key insight with #MosulHeritage\n\n2. **Senior Architect Engagement**:\n   - Day 1: Panel speakers\n   - Day 3: Contractor/pricing expert\n   - Day 4: Interview subjects\n   - Day 5: Practice pitch recipients\n   - Competition: Judges\n\n3. **Measurement & Momentum**:\n   - Track social media engagement daily\n   - Create a \"pitch win\" board for successful client conversations\n   - Document temperature/comfort improvements at Beit Turath\n\n### **Competition Preparation (Month Between)**\n\nStructure the month strategically:\n- Week 1: Site analysis and client needs assessment\n- Week 2: Design development with material selection\n- Week 3: ROI calculations and visualization\n- Week 4: Pitch deck and presentation prep\n\nWhatsApp group activities:\n- Weekly design clinics\n- Peer review sessions\n- Supplier price updates\n- Success story sharing\n\n### **Key Adjustments for Culture Change**\n\n1. **Language Shift**: Never say \"sustainable\" - always \"profitable,\" \"comfortable,\" or \"proven\"\n\n2. **Evidence Collection**: Throughout training, build a shared database of:\n   - Local project successes\n   - Client testimonials\n   - Cost savings data\n   - Comfort improvement metrics\n\n3. **Multiplier Effect**: Each participant commits to:\n   - Teaching one colleague\n   - Converting one skeptical senior\n   - Completing one demonstration project\n\n### **Success Metrics**\n\nBeyond technical skills, measure:\n- Number of senior architects engaged\n- Social media reach/engagement\n- Real client pitches attempted\n- Design competition entries quality\n- Follow-on projects initiated\n\nThis iteration maintains your learn-apply-sell rhythm while weaving in the culture change mission. Like a well-designed courtyard that draws in cool air naturally, this structure draws in skeptics and converts them through experience and evidence.\n\nThe pushback element you mentioned?

The competition will involve senior architects as judges - this is smart for culture change.\n\n2. They'll host at Beit Turath al Musul - perfect for demonstrating heritage = sustainable. This addresses the site visit issue.\n\n3. Participants are architects with laptops - so digital tools are feasible.\n\n4. WhatsApp group + Mosul Space events = ongoing support structure.\n\n5. Key outcome: Skills + culture change. Not just technical skills but changing mindsets of both junior architects AND senior firm leaders. The social media component is about broader cultural shift.\n\nThe user wants to create a movement, not just train individuals. The metaphor about \"heritage design is sustainable design\" - building before electricity - is powerful.\n\nNow I need to:\n1. Review the current structure against these goals\n2. Identify where culture change elements can be strengthened\n3. Ensure the training builds toward the competition effectively\n4. Focus on practical selling skills that address senior architects' skepticism\n5. Leverage the heritage venue throughout\n\nKey insight: The training is as much about changing hearts and minds as teaching technical skills. The \"hard to sell\" perception from senior architects is the real barrier to overcome.",

Apply Modern Sustainable Innovations in Iraq’s Context:\nDiscover Iraq's use of renewable energy, green building materials, and modern insulation for sustainable homes and buildings.\nEvaluate how combining traditional architectural principles with modern innovations can reduce energy consumption, improve living standards, and lower environmental impact.\n\nPart 1\n\nSustainability: Study the Past Build The Future\n\nSustainable Housing in Iraq\nSustainable housing refers to designing, building, and operating homes in ways that reduce their environmental impact. This approach emphasizes the efficient use of resources like energy, water, and building materials, and promotes a healthy living environment.\n\nSource: https://www.nhcnow.com/blog/sustainable-housing-innovative-solutions-for-eco-friendly-living/ \n\nSustainable Housing in Iraq\nThe UN-Habitat report provided an ideal description of the characteristics of sustainable homes that must be provided to ensure adequate housing that meets the requirements of the population and achieves healthy and comfortable housing for them, as these characteristics included:  \nHealthy, durable, safe, and secure.  \nAffordable for the whole spectrum of incomes.  \nUsing ecological low-energy and affordable building materials and technology.  \nResilient to sustain potential natural disasters and climatic impacts.  \nConnected to decent, safe, and affordable energy, water, sanitation, and recycling facilities.   \nUsing  energy  and  water  most  efficiently  and  equipped  with  certain  on-site  renewable energy generation and water recycling capabilities.  \nNot polluting the environment and protected from external pollution.\nWell, connected to jobs, shops, health- and child-care, education, and other services.  \nProperly  integrated  into,  and  enhancing,  the  social,  cultural,  and  economic  fabric  of  the local neighborhood and the wider urban areas.  \nProperly run and maintained, timely renovated and retrofitted\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381098688_Toward_Sustainable_Housing_Construction_in_Iraq \n\nSustainable Housing in Iraq\nThe conventional construction approach for housing in Iraq no longer meets environmental, economic, and social needs due to:\nHigh energy and water consumption\nEnvironmental pollution\nResource depletion\nRising energy prices\n\nShifting towards sustainable construction in Iraq can address these issues by:\nReducing resource consumption\nEnhancing environmental preservation\nDeveloping sustainable performance for all stakeholders\nPromoting a sustainable culture in the construction industry\n\nThis transition contributes to more responsible development and resource management in Iraq's housing sector.\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381098688_Toward_Sustainable_Housing_Construction_in_Iraq \n\nTechnologies Integrated into Housing\nSolar Energy\nSolar radiation, also called the electromagnetic radiation, is emitted by the sun. This light and radiation emitted is harnessed using a variety of technologies such as solar power to convert it into electricity or other forms of energy.\nToday solar energy is not only considered as an alternative power source, but is thought of as a greener, more efficient and cost-effective solution to power homes, offices & commercial buildings.\nThere are many solar technologies, but homeowners have 3 main options at their disposal:\nUsing solar energy to generate electricity.\nUsing solar energy for water heating.\nUsing the sun as a natural light source.\nSource: https://www.marketwatch.com/guides/solar/ways-to-incorporate-solar/ \n\nTechnologies Integrated into Housing\nEnergy Modeling\nEnergy Modeling is physics-based software simulation of building energy use. It allows architects and engineers to foresee via simulation how a structure will interact with its environment, anticipate energy consumption, and optimize components for efficiency.\nThis program uses a home’s size, layout, insulation, windows, appliances and HVAC systems as inputs. Local weather is also taken into consideration, and within a short time the program can output data representing an entire year’s worth of energy consumption.\nSource: https://energygeeksinc.com/understanding-home-energy-modeling/ \n\nTechnologies Integrated into Housing\nGreen Materials\nGreen building is construction that primarily uses natural materials and renewable resources. These structures look really cool but also feature design benefits such as thermal efficiency and safety features. \n\nSource: https://www.thezebra.com/resources/home/green-building-materials/ \n\nSteps in Making Your Home Sustainable\nTransforming your home into a sustainable living space is easier than you might think. Here are practical steps you can take to make your house more eco-friendly:\nEnergy Efficiency Upgrades: Start by replacing old appliances with energy-efficient models. Ensure your home is well-insulated to reduce heating and cooling costs. Consider installing smart thermostats for better energy management.\nSwitch to Renewable Energy: If possible, invest in renewable energy sources like solar panels or small wind turbines. This not only reduces your carbon footprint but can also offer long-term financial savings.\nWater Conservation: Install low-flow faucets, showerheads, and toilets to reduce water usage. Collecting rainwater for garden irrigation is another effective way to conserve water.\nUse Sustainable Materials: When renovating or decorating, opt for materials that are renewable and eco-friendly, like bamboo flooring, recycled glass tiles, or low-VOC paints.\nWaste Reduction: Practice recycling and composting to minimize waste. Choose products with minimal packaging and consider buying second-hand or repurposed items.\nGardening and Landscaping: Plant a garden to grow your food, and use native plants in your landscaping to support local biodiversity and reduce water usage.\nEducation and Awareness: Stay informed about sustainable practices and technologies. Share your experiences and learnings with your community to inspire others.\nSource: https://www.nhcnow.com/blog/sustainable-housing-innovative-solutions-for-eco-friendly-living/ \n\nPart 2\n\nIraqi Architectural Heritage\n\nBefore we dive into Iraqi architecture, let’s check out what other cool stuff the Middle East region has to offer in terms of buildings and design.\nSource: \n\nSustainable architecture is a general term that describes environmentally conscious design techniques in the field of architecture. It seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of building by enhancing efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, and development space\nSustainable Architecture in Middle East\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281282134_Green_sustainable_buildings_in_Middle-east_as_resources_for_energy_Conservation_and_less_Maintenance \n\nGlobalization blurs cultural boundaries while paradoxically heightening awareness of ethnic identities, especially in the Middle East where tradition and modernity compete.\nThe West-Middle East relationship has evolved through three phases:\nColonial (hybrid urban forms)\nIndependence (pseudo-modern design)\nGlobalization (postmodern style)\nEach shaping urban landscapes differently.\nMiddle Eastern cityscapes reflect an ongoing identity struggle, balancing cultural heritage with global influences through a mix of traditional and ultra-modern elements.\nSustainable Architecture in Middle East\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344340673_Architecture_in_the_Middle_East_Cultural_identity_sustainability_methodologies \n\nMiddle Eastern traditional architecture incorporated sustainable elements like wind towers, courtyards, and passive cooling to adapt to harsh climates.\nSustainable Architecture in Middle East\nIranian traditional courtyards as microclimate modifiers, (a) Abbāsi House, Kashan, (b) Tabātabāei House, Kashan, (c) Pirnia House, Yazd (d) Navab Vakil House, Yazd, (e) Borujerdis House, Kashan, and (f) Ameri House, Kashan\nSource: https://injarch.com/sustainable-architecture-in-the-middle-east/ \n\nIn recent decades, there has been a notable shift towards adopting contemporary sustainable practices in Middle Eastern architecture. Green building certifications, such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and Estidama in the UAE, have gained prominence, encouraging architects and developers to design and construct environmentally friendly buildings.\nSustainable Architecture in Middle East\nSource: https://injarch.com/sustainable-architecture-in-the-middle-east/ \n\nGreen building is an innovative construction approach that centers on sustainable practices to minimize the environmental impact of a structure.

His architectural designs favoured the use of economic local materials and ethnic designs.\nHassan Fathy pioneered \"appropriate technology\" in Egyptian architecture, using methods and materials compatible with local socio-cultural, economic, and ecological conditions.\nSource: https://en.wataninet.com/features/in-egypt-building-goes-green/42031/ \n\nSustainable Architecture in Middle East\nEgypt\nFathy’s most famous work was the city of New Gourna in Luxor, which he designed in 1945.\nSource: https://en.wataninet.com/features/in-egypt-building-goes-green/42031/ \n\nSustainable Architecture in Middle East\nEgypt\nGrand Egyptian Museum (GEM), was awarded the EDGE Advanced Green Building Certification, making it the first museum in Africa and the Middle East, and one of a few worldwide, to receive this certification.\nThe museum, spanning 500,000 square meters, incorporates sustainable features like reflective roofing, external shading, efficient lighting, and smart energy meters.\nThese measures save energy equivalent to removing 400 cars from Cairo's streets annually, and conserve 63.4 million liters of Nile water yearly.\nSource: https://www.ifc.org/en/pressroom/2024/ifc-recognizes-the-grand-egyptian-museum-as-the-first-edge-advanced-green-museum-in-africa-and-the-middle-east \n\nSustainable Architecture in Middle East\nEgypt\nGrand Egyptian Museum (GEM)\nSource: https://www.ifc.org/en/pressroom/2024/ifc-recognizes-the-grand-egyptian-museum-as-the-first-edge-advanced-green-museum-in-africa-and-the-middle-east \n\nNow, let's transition to the Iraqi architectural\nSource\n\nMosul and Islamic Architecture\nThe Islamic world has enriched human history with its scientific and artistic achievements, and contributed both within and outside of Islamic borders to the advent of the modern era. The field of Islamic Architecture is a key example of this rich legacy. This can be witnessed in the timeless and unprecedented buildings throughout Islamic civilization, among them.\nMosul city represents one of the cities established by Muslim architects and designers that there is a great awareness to issues of sustainability with their three pillars (Environmental sustainability, Social sustainability,  Economic sustainability)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Architecture\nSustainable practices aligned with local climates and resources.\nUsed local materials and methods, addressing community needs and fostering social interaction.\nIn Islamic regions, designs were often influenced by Islamic principles and values.\nExamples of sustainable features in traditional architecture. Al-Kadumia city in Baghdad and the narrow streets, The compact style and winding paths make apartment buildings close to each other to give the shading to the walker in these paths and block sunlight from residential and surrounding buildings.\n\nTraditional House Principles\nAdaptation and Protection:\nAdaptation is the exploitation of potential resources in harsh environmental circumstances and dealing with these circumstances to achieve heat comfort to dwellers and to exploit natural sources of energy\nProtection is to eliminate the impact of harsh environmental circumstances. There are many basic principles on which the architecture of the traditional dwelling is based.\n\n\nTraditional House Principles\nThe internal courtyard provides protection from the climate, natural light, privacy, and ventilation. By adding plants and water features, the courtyard becomes shaded and cool, with the air flowing into nearby rooms. In the morning, the courtyard is cool, and by noon, air moves from shaded areas into the indoor spaces. In the evening, the courtyard releases heat and pulls in cool air from above as the hot air rises and the temperature drops.\n\nIraq Traditional Architecture\nThe traditional Iraqi Architecture differs from the architecture of other countries thanks to a richness of elements that are in harmony with the specific climatic and social conditions of the country.\nThe local environmental and social factors have constituted the main influences for the design and the planning of traditional architecture in Iraq, from the large scale to the smallest detail. For instance, the traditional Iraqi house is characterized by distinctive features that are appropriate to the local climate and the social aspects, in so representing an ideal solution providing the Iraqi family with an indoor environment of absolute privacy.\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nTransformation of the Iraqi Architecture in the 20th Century\nColonial Era 1914-1930: A significant feature characterizing the buildings of this period is the emphasis put on the main facade, where the richness of the architectural details was concentrated, whilst the other elevations of the buildings were left almost or completely shorn of any ornament. \nAal Al-bait school – Baghdad 1922\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nTransformation of the Iraqi Architecture in the 20th Century\nThe Architecture in Iraq 1930-1950: The 1930s saw the maturation of modern architectural concepts introduced in the 1920s, translating new ideas into tangible urban environments in Iraq.\nWhile this period established a homogeneous modern design language, it maintained links to neoclassical styles rooted in mid-19th century architecture, creating a unique blend of old and new.\nThe Industrial Exhibition in Baghdad – 1932 (left)\nKing Faisal II Square - 1944 (right)\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nTransformation of the Iraqi Architecture in the 20th Century\nThe Architecture in Iraq 1930-1950\nThe central Train station in Baghdad 1949\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nTransformation of the Iraqi Architecture in the 20th Century\nIraqi Architecture between 1950 and 1960: Building facades saw significant advancements, with new plaster mixtures (lime-sand or cement-sand) becoming widespread, influencing design styles.\nThe period introduced novel architectural elements like curtains and screens of various shapes and materials, adding diversity to building finishes.\nAl -Rafidain Bank – 1954 (left)\nMerjan Building - 1954 (right)\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nTransformation of the Iraqi Architecture in the 20th Century\nIraqi Architecture between 1960 and 1980: This period focused on deepening Iraq's unique architectural character by closely examining and incorporating local environmental elements and traditional materials.\nIraqi architects became more professional, employing local craftsmen and climate-responsive design, resulting in a more refined and contextually appropriate modern architecture.\nAL-Rashid Street in Baghdad -1961 (left) \nFederation of Industries - 1966 (right)\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nPart 3\n\nSustainable Innovations in Iraq\n\nModern Innovations\nOne of the sustainable construction strategies that is beneficial for the transition to sustainable housing construction is Enhancing Sustainable Materials and Technology.\nEnhancing Sustainable Materials\nUse of environmentally friendly materials that resist weather factors\nMaterials that preserve building heat in winter and contribute to ventilation in summer\nDouble glazing for good insulation between internal and external environments\nEncourage local suppliers to produce green products\nUse of green building materials and products as an important strategy in building design\nTechnology\nImplementation of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy\nUse of more efficient water systems\nWater reuse technologies\nSystems that reduce energy consumption and costs\nTechnologies that enhance the sustainable construction approach\n\nIraq’s Heritage Buildings Post-Conflict\nMosul is one of Iraq’s richest cities in terms of cultural heritage and contains numerous archaeological, historical, cultural and religious sites, monuments and landmarks.

Because some people said that compared to Design Thinking, technical practice may be more attractive. But after the beginning of the course, I found that students can understand the importance of the reason behind a creation, and try to improve social problems through their works. I saw teams who are very creative and artistic, including a group called “Soul Box\"（魂 Box）. They noticed the low-wage issues of Taiwan and created a pressure relief mask. Users can enjoy screaming to release the pressure with head buried inside. The work is not just an idea, but also an observation of society. By the way, we did yoga before the start of the workshop. Perhaps it is nothing to do with their work, but everyone was very involved.\n\n\nDesign Thinking\nA few key principals:\nDiverge \n(lots of ideas!)\nConverge \n(test those ideas with your stakeholder!)\nThink with your hands\nUnderstand problem before you solve it\nRole play  / “Empathy”\nDiverse Teams\nHaving a process frees the mind to be creative (constraints)\nRole of space in design\n\n\nDesign Thinking Games / Ice breakers!\n30 Circles\nFridge\nBear VS Lion\n10 Ideas 2 min challenge\n\nDesign Thinking\nLet’s go through the whole process right now :)\n\n1. 4 min Each - Get Story!\nInterview partner, start with idea or theme.

Like, can ask people for stories, collect what we can, get pictures online. I'm not sure exactly. Yeah. Printed catalogs and price lists sounds good, and if we can possibly get suppliers to come in or get on calls, could be also kinda cool. Maybe we could just have, 15 minutes, and people will just, like, go around calling and trying to get information, getting that experience of talking to suppliers. Either record a video messages or role play. I think role play makes more sense. Okay. So iOS start with learn. Camera, traditional architecture principles. It's a real examples. Yeah. So it's, like, a history transformation and what happened. Yeah. That could be kinda cool. I'm not sure it'll be so easy to, like, do that to walk and get into buildings, but yeah, It could be interesting to try to have a walk around even a bit too rough and mostly so we don't have to go too far. I'm just Look at that. Also, Basarath and iOS has some really interesting old drawings and diagrams, and maybe we can look at those old drawings and diagrams and try to identify occupant comfort. And maybe this is also really important Like, day 1 should be about this isn't about green. It's about Claude. And comfort And Helping your client however you can. You know, reduce costs long term, reduce costs even for payment upfront, and make sure that they love living in their home. So that's the main thing. I like the then and now, comparison post. That's really cool. And then skeptical uncle. Yeah. One of the things is the Sirdab, s I r d a b, that is becoming less and less common It was a basement cool place in homes where they used to store food. Amongst other things. It's becoming less and less commonly used. For many reasons. I think you can look into the interviews for reasons why. And new homes aren't even built So, yeah, day 2, should we focus on the courtyard? It seems, like, way too specific. Although, it is one of the the things that is, possible to do with new construction that has a lot of benefits to have at least a tiny garden in the middle of the home. Yeah. Islamic architecture, sustainability is Yeah. Maybe it could be interesting to talk about this and all of the benefits Because know, different interventions have different benefits. And an insulated wall is one thing, but a green space in the middle of the house has Many ancillary and side benefits. So that's, the learn part of day 2. Okay. I don't if we can visit functioning courtyards in the city. Yeah. Day 2 apply is a little tough. Because people don't really let you into their houses. There is the Beitna nonprofit that has a courtyard, but it's covered. It's like you know, they modified it later to cover it, so I'm not sure it's so helpful. Yeah. I'm not sure exactly what to do for day 2, his courtyard, I think. Maybe it could be more of, design. Know, we started making models One of the things that I wanted to do is for people to have from very early on a, case study. Right? Like, if we can get cases from local architects and people are working on real people's homes, or we give them, like, a model case of you know, a 150 square meters. This is the standard then let's see what we can do for that. Over the course of the days, you know, they can say, okay. So let's take the base model home, and everyone does their own adaptation We make groups, and and groups work together to make their adaptations. Yeah. Courtyards waste space with ROI. Data. I like that, ROI case for the cell. 5 ways Courtyards save money could be interesting. Yeah. So learn about all the different materials we can use, It seems a little bit the flow is not so smooth. Right? It's like heritage design. Okay. Let's just focus on courtyards, and then we get into material. I wonder if it can be more progressive and, add up to, like, a more cohesive kind of story that we build up. Yeah. And then the cell for day 3. Yeah. The apply is also pretty lame for day 3. You're just calling people? That sounds like For 4 thing. Price database, Yeah. I guess that that's kind of useful. The idea was like, to make a BOM or BOQ And the ROI and to have these 2 things merged together. So we do them incrementally. We a case. We build up strategy and the BOQ, and then maybe do some simulation and ROI and sort of do little bits of it every day so it adds up and then at the end, we, we share the Projects. Or we share the kickoff to the projects because it it goes into the design competition. So what's the difference between day 5 and what people are doing? The design company. Okay. So visualization. I'm not sure if people are gonna learn light rhino or ladybug. Content creation masterclass. Maybe maybe. I can be yeah, something. Yeah. Share viral architecture. What makes people share? I'm not so sure about the learn section here. Although, there are some people architecture firms that do a better job, and maybe we could ask them to to do this, like, research on TikTok accounts or architecture accounts or gather, like, from people's experience as architects, what are people sharing the most and try to come up with principles and maybe a strategy for how to share more appropriate for Iraq things. That would get as much views. Although, I'm not sure to have a whole day on social media, it's a good idea. But maybe part of it. Yeah. If there's any completed sustainability projects, I don't think we'll be able to record satisfied occupant testimonials iOS. Maybe people could share from their own practice, or we can capture these stories beforehand Okay. Case study videos. I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe we could do that. AB testing, we gotta keep it simpler and more practical to do. BOSS specific ROI presentations Maybe. Yeah. So day 4 feels like it needs modified. Global innovations adapted to most of this context. Address recorded concerns and certain areas. Success metrics beyond just sales. Okay. I don't know about day 5 either. Yeah. Visiting Marcus Claude is practice real pitches, doc objections, and successes. I know one of the people said that they have their studio their their their supply shop. Insulated with a that special kind of foam concrete thing, and we could go visit that and feel what it's like. If it fits into the schedule, Hello? It would be tough to do that in 5 hours. Like, what are we gonna take an hour or 2 as we go down back? It might not be great to leave. And we're already in Beitzvahat Moslem. Pitch competition with specific personas, Okay. Yeah. That's cool. So we get people practice pitching them different things. I like that. Like, you come with a little case. You have you know, 15 minutes to come up with your pitch strategy, and then you try to sell them on different, implementations, and then you know, we see how convinced people are. Okay. Yeah. The mind mapping could be good. A negotiation could be good. And the b o q slash ROI should be connected across the board. Take this feedback and, do a round of updates and do it both in this list and table",

And the Instagram stuff that you were working on, it was, really great to have, the cell sections 5 ways Courtyard save money. You know, it's very specific and clear and kinda cool and then and now comparison posts for social media is great. So, like, having that as a part of the cell is really great. And what we can actually have is see the data that comes back from that. Like, how many likes, how many shares, and that could be a part of, what we do. Yeah. And I like the touring of the thermal camera. I study the old architecture drawings and photos online, offline, books, the history lesson is great. Maybe not just the and why it disappeared, but maybe that and other things. And we need to make it more interactive Claude 1, This is pretty like, straightforward, but maybe we could Ask, like, do you have stories? Share stories of how things were, and then if you have photos, you have family photos on your phone. You know? Maybe you can collect a family photo and bring it If it's like a printed photo. You know? And, then we can talk about the principles, you know, is one of the things that I thought would be good is that we should be collating. Maybe we can, have a wall with sticky notes on it. It's just like principles that we collect over time. And then we can have the element as, like, the costs per unit whatever it is, volume, mass, length, and then, the ROI and multiple dimensions. Right? Like, there's return on investment terms of comfort as well as price and other dimensions, that relate to probably a lot of the green, certification stuff, like, that's kind of an interesting thing that we didn't really talk about. Is the sustainability and green certification. So there is an ROI that is financial, and we should focus a lot on that because that's what motivates people mostly, especially in places like Mosul. But there is also the air quality and the health benefits that we haven't even We've begun to share. The comfort audit checklist. Maybe it's a different name. It's a little broader, but that checklist could be something that is connected to the the green and sustainability audits and you know, I know that in most of the developing, the green Zugarot system, there's the green pyramids from Egypt, and there's lead and others. Maybe we can connect somehow with that. And I like the idea of making it chill and, like, hey. Just come an audit for, like, what would be a good house? And then be like, oh, yeah. By the way, that's how you make a sustainable home. Let's start the iOS. Somehow, I like this idea of making it more incremental. Like, so the principal find the materials, get the BOQ for get the the prices, BOUQ, and then, ROI. And put putting them all together. And so maybe we could have, like, a worksheet That gets developed over time. With these, different elements and gotta think of, like, the tabs, that we may want on this worksheet. And will be, like, one of the structures that we use, that we develop. Yeah. Different strategies, not just courtyard, small benefits. Maybe we'd deepen into that. And have a presentation for it. Maybe some case studies from around the world. And maybe they're they should keep there. Case study out, like, a printed, like, 1 50, 150, and they should, like, sketch on it and then do a quick, like, BOQ ROI thing, you know, with everything that we do. It's like, does this make sense here? Does this make sense here? You know? And to keep in mind their clients at all times and to in mind their empathy. And that could be fun for the learners. It's like to make it more interactive. And I like more interactivity. Yeah. And then the apply could be like, okay. So you did these quick sketches. Which ones actually make sense, Cardboard models could be fun. I'm not sure how useful it is or is it a waste of time. What's beneficial about the cardboard models? Versus the digital models A Android minutes is yeah, think of if that's useful. Add design elements to BOQ. Don't think we need to make the BOQ a beautiful spreadsheet. Okay. I'm not sure the cell for day 2 really is that great either. Why this design serves your family better? Mean, it could be nice to do this pitch. Yeah. So the pitch, getting feedback, pitch pitch offs, you know, like, different people pitch, and then we see who did the best pitch. We record them all maybe we share them on on social media, but I'm not sure I actually have to do that easily, well, and fast. And the know, 90 minutes we have Payment plans and financing, day 3. Materials and money. Yeah. We already started talking about that. On day 1 and 2. I'm not sure new here. Material property demonstration is kinda nice. Get a feel for things. Yeah. There's no real payment plans and financing, so we don't really need to have that. And the cost of performance analysis, we've also been doing all along the way. So we need something different here. We could actually do small tour of another Claude, maybe. Or yeah. I'm not sure what to do. Day 3 materials. Supplier calling, I like that. That one sounds fun. Maybe we can go visit suppliers. Or maybe we can build with some of the materials practically, like, you know, we can get some of those concrete forms or the different things and and, built a little shelter or something. I don't know. Good, better, best packages. Upselling. Yeah. So we can start with that. Gold deloxing, the the sale, and really helping the Claude. Feel and understand that we're there for them and with them. Yeah. Simple calculation tools Improving value Yeah. I think having maybe a simple architecture software that shows the ROI could be nice. So some kind of modeling, I think, would be good. Doesn't have to be rhino. Think about which modeling software could be useful. Yeah. What's the ROI for Claude study home? Yeah. So for the case study that they've been building, are they doing it in groups? I was thinking that we do it in groups of 4, we have 5 groups. 60 second case study explanation, Yeah. I like the idea of a client presentation, dike. We can give them a template. Although clients are very much in person, traditional Maybe the presentation deck can be on WhatsApp or something. Something that's more grounded in Iraqi reality. Yeah. It could be on social media. It could be, on Instagram iOS. Or a private Instagram post. I'm not sure. Making it real. Reviewing everyone's case study, common objections, Yeah. I'm not sure what we're learning in day 5. It's a little bit just a quick overview. Final presentation preparation. Yeah. Continue working. My client meetings, I like that. It's to improve their design. They should have a mock client meeting. Go back PISH competition with the architecture firm leads their judging and scoring. I think Could be good. Public commitment to next steps. Launch design competition. It still feels like, doing 2 design competitions. So doesn't seem that exciting. Yeah.

      "content": "Let me analyze the feedback and identify key themes:\n\n1. The user wants to move beyond just \"comfort\" - include empathy but not fixate on it\n2. They really liked the social media/WhatsApp elements from earlier versions\n3. They want more interactivity and story collection\n4. They want a progressive worksheet/system that builds over time\n5. They're concerned about practical realities (no payment plans, in-person client culture)\n6. They want to connect to green certification systems\n7. They want group work (groups of 4, 5 groups total)\n8. They're worried about redundancy between the 5-day training and the design competition\n9. They want more variety in activities - not just theory\n10. Material demonstrations and hands-on building could be good\n\nChallenges I see:\n- Day 3 and 5 feel weak/redundant\n- Need more variety in learning activities\n- The progression isn't clear enough\n- Missing the social media momentum building\n- Not enough hands-on/interactive elements\n- Unclear how this connects to the final competition\n\nLet me propose improvements that address these issues while maintaining the learn-apply-sell structure.Looking at your feedback, I see several key challenges and opportunities. Let me critique and improve the structure:\n\n## Key Challenges I See:\n\n1. **Redundancy**: Topics like cost analysis and materials appear multiple times without clear progression\n2. **Day 5 Weakness**: It feels like a recap rather than a culmination\n3. **Missing Social Elements**: Lost the viral/community building aspects that were working\n4. **Too Linear**: Not enough variety in activities and learning modes\n5. **Competition Confusion**: The 5-day training and later competition feel disconnected\n\n## Improved Structure: Building Momentum Through Stories\n\n### **Core Innovation**: Progressive Group Project + Social Proof\n- Groups of 4 work on shared 150sqm case throughout\n- Daily social media challenges build public accountability\n- Worksheet grows with: Principles → Materials → Costs → ROI → Stories\n\n### **Revised 5-Day Structure**\n\n#### **Day 1: Collecting Wisdom**\n**Learn (90 min)**\n- Beit Turath thermal camera tour\n- **Story Circle**: \"Share a memory of a cool/comfortable space from childhood\"\n- Analyze old photos/drawings participants bring\n- Start **Principles Wall** with sticky notes\n\n**Apply (120 min)**\n- Groups receive 150sqm case study\n- Create empathy maps for 3 client types\n- Initial sketch incorporating 1-2 traditional principles\n- Start master worksheet: Tab 1 - Client Needs\n\n**Sell (90 min)**\n- Create \"Then vs Now\" comparison post\n- Share family photos with captions about lost comfort\n- Track engagement metrics\n- **WhatsApp Challenge**: \"What we've forgotten about staying cool\"\n\n#### **Day 2: Design DNA**\n**Learn (90 min)**\n- All intervention strategies (not just courtyards):\n  - Orientation/shading\n  - Natural ventilation\n  - Thermal mass\n  - Green spaces\n- Connect to green certification basics (LEED, local systems)\n- Guest speaker via video: Successful local architect\n\n**Apply (120 min)**\n- Groups redesign case with 3-4 strategies\n- **Speed Dating Critiques**: Groups rotate and critique each other\n- Calculate space efficiency\n- Worksheet Tab 2: Design Strategies + Benefits Matrix\n\n**Sell (90 min)**\n- Create Instagram carousel: \"5 Hidden Benefits of [Their Chosen Strategy]\"\n- Pitch battle: Best multi-benefit explanation\n- Track which posts get most engagement\n- Start building follower base\n\n#### **Day 3: Materials Lab**\n**Learn (90 min)**\n- **Hands-on Material Festival**:\n  - Touch, weigh, compare materials\n  - Build mini test walls\n  - Thermal testing with heat lamps\n- Visit nearby building using innovative materials (if possible)\n\n**Apply (120 min)**\n- **Supplier Calling Chaos**: 15-minute frenzy\n- Build material sample boards\n- Calculate quantities for case study\n- Worksheet Tab 3: Materials + Suppliers + Prices\n\n**Sell (90 min)**\n- Film \"Material Personality Test\" videos\n- Create Good/Better/Best visual guides\n- **TikTok Challenge**: \"Which insulation are you?\" (make it fun/viral)\n- Share supplier negotiation tips\n\n#### **Day 4: Proof of Concept**\n**Learn (90 min)**\n- Simple modeling software demo (SketchUp?)\n- ROI calculation masterclass\n- Health/comfort metrics beyond just temperature\n- How to document for green certification\n\n**Apply (120 min)**\n- Complete ROI calculations\n- Create simple 3D visualization\n- **Mock Site Visit**: Groups present to \"client\" (other groups)\n- Worksheet Tab 4: Complete ROI + Certification Points\n\n**Sell (90 min)**\n- Produce 60-second case study video\n- Create WhatsApp-friendly presentation (vertical format)\n- **Live Testing**: Share with real contacts, track responses\n- Refine based on immediate feedback\n\n#### **Day 5: Going Viral**\n**Learn (90 min)**\n- **Success Story Panel**: 3 groups present best elements\n- Analyze what content got most engagement\n- Address collected objections\n- Competition strategy session\n\n**Apply (120 min)**\n- **Material Building Challenge**: Groups build small demonstration models\n- Create \"pitch kit\" with all materials\n- Practice with visiting critics (local architects/suppliers)\n- Finalize master worksheet as template\n\n**Sell (90 min)**\n- **Public Showcase**: \n  - Each group pitches to panel of judges\n  - Live social media coverage\n  - Real clients invited to observe\n- Launch design competition with momentum\n- **Commitment Ceremony**: Each person states their next action\n\n### **Key Improvements**\n\n1. **Progressive Worksheet**: \n   - Tab 1: Client Analysis\n   - Tab 2: Design Strategies\n   - Tab 3: Materials & Costs\n   - Tab 4: ROI & Certification\n   - Tab 5: Marketing & Stories\n\n2. **Social Media Integration**:\n   - Daily challenges build audience\n   - Track metrics for learning\n   - Create shareable content library\n   - Build momentum for competition\n\n3. **Variety of Activities**:\n   - Story circles\n   - Material festivals\n   - Building challenges\n   - Speed dating critiques\n   - Live client interactions\n\n4. **Clear Competition Connection**:\n   - Day 5 becomes a mini-version of final competition\n   - Groups can evolve their case study for final submission\n   - Built-in audience and momentum\n\n5. **Beyond Comfort**:\n   - Health benefits\n   - Certification points\n   - Cultural preservation\n   - Economic development\n   - Environmental impact\n\nThis structure is like cultivating a garden - you plant seeds (stories/principles), nurture growth (design/materials), prove the harvest (ROI/proof), and share the abundance (viral content/competition).\n\nThe pushback you mentioned? Built in through the speed critiques and live testing. Real learning happens when their WhatsApp post gets 2 likes versus 200.\n\nWhat do you think needs further adjustment?",

They're concerned about practical realities (no payment plans, in-person client culture)\n6. They want to connect to green certification systems\n7. They want group work (groups of 4, 5 groups total)\n8. They're worried about redundancy between the 5-day training and the design competition\n9. They want more variety in activities - not just theory\n10. Material demonstrations and hands-on building could be good\n\nChallenges I see:\n- Day 3 and 5 feel weak/redundant\n- Need more variety in learning activities\n- The progression isn't clear enough\n- Missing the social media momentum building\n- Not enough hands-on/interactive elements\n- Unclear how this connects to the final competition\n\nLet me propose improvements that address these issues while maintaining the learn-apply-sell structure.",

you plant seeds (stories/principles), nurture growth (design/materials), prove the harvest (ROI/proof), and share the abundance (viral content/competition).\n\nThe pushback you mentioned? Built in through the speed critiques and live testing. Real learning happens when their WhatsApp post gets 2 likes versus 200.\n\nWhat do you think needs further adjustment?",

So Instagram and, TikTok is where things will get likes, not WhatsApp. I also like the idea of the design challenge having an element of the social media Being a part of their scoring. So You know, number of likes divided by number of days or something like that. Stories iOS all material fest I'm not sure about that. Live client interactions if possible. Speed dating critiques. You know, maybe we could design for each other somehow that way we have, like, real, quote, unquote clients in the classroom. The worksheet seems good. Although client analysis, and the you know, the case study that they'll be getting can be tab 1 Design strategies Or you know, maybe it could be, like, the historic slash yeah. I mean, they could have the the the different approaches there, historic, architecture and Modern technology, etcetera. Materials and costs, Yeah. Materials, BOQ. Do we need a BOQ? Tab and an ROI tab. ROI and certification, so we split that marketing and stories. Yeah. The the work sheet seems like it can be used in some improvements. Somehow instead of, like, just saying marketing and stories, maybe it could be more of a you know, where we actually save the information or do a design or strategically do something. Maybe we need more. Worksheets. So there's this workbook that is maybe something they could use, and there are architecture firm that is b o q b I m prices, design, clients, bid proposal pricing, ROI, all that. I think maybe we should keep it standardized to what is normally used in architecture firms, maybe simplified or something. But like that. And then we can have another sheet that has the material design strategies etcetera. Some of them might be better off not in spreadsheets and just, like, markdown files that are work workbooks. So let's, like, reflect on that and see but let's, also make sure that that stuff is connected to an improved 5 day structure plus 6th day design competition. Thermal is great. Yeah. Story circle. Maybe that could be our again. It's like, it could be either from their own personal life or their family or even a trip or something learned in school, but, like, Yeah. A story of a inspiring place that They think would be the future of Mosul's architecture. And one of the ways I frame the design, you can see in the previous PowerPoint presentation. I call it learn from the past to build the future. Maybe you can look into that document to see if there's other things that we can pull out and bring over here that would be helpful. So Yeah. Analyze old photos and drawings. Yeah. And whenever find a moment connecting it to a workbook or a worksheet either the spreadsheet or the workbook elements, you can bring them in and just indicate where we'll be using them So now we go to apply for day 1. And we see groups received the case ID, empathy maps. That's great. Although they could be doing it for each other, maybe each person could take on a different client type, how do we really use the 4, the groups of 5 groups of 4 people best, I'm worried that, you know, 1 person will do all the work rest won't So do they each need to do their own? How do they work together? Then in our comparison posts, I like that. Not sure, should be on WhatsApp. I think Instagram or social media somewhere will be better family photo with captions about lost of comfort. Sell think I also like the idea of the cell being more dynamic in person negotiations, speaking, soft skills, like that kind of stuff. Be good. Leveraging the tools that they make, not just social media stuff. Maybe that could be the thing that produces a social media content that gets shared at the end quickly, but we don't wanna spend the whole time on social media. Intervention strategies for date to Yeah. How does it connect to green? Certification? Yeah. We could make a local video of a successful architect. I think that that works. Talking about, you know, the fact that people do actually like this kind of architecture. I I think I can maybe make a 10 minute video Apply. Gupta redesigned the case with 3 to 4 strategies. Maybe each group, like, each person designs one strategy and does the BOM and ROI and then they can, like, rotate try to pick, like, the best. That way everyone does something, and then each team You know, sort of leveraging liberating structures sort of strategies. We all do that for the entire room, and then we say, okay. What's one thing. Design strategies plus benefits matrix. Okay. Cool. Yeah. You're showing the worksheet tab. That's great. Great. Instagram carousel. 5 hidden benefits of yeah. That's interesting. Start building from our base while they all probably was gonna suggest they share on their own things, and we can repost it from a new social media account we make the Claude. But they should all share it from theirs. What do you what do you think? Should we share it from theirs and report it class, or just need different Yeah. So we'll touch all the materials, do thermal testing, Supply of chaos. So that thermal testing is not just it because it's also about how you use the the materials, the design, the orientation, etcetera. How does the building sample board of materials help? With clients? Maybe it could be useful. I don't really like the material personnel that you test the video. Think it's kind of Claude. Which installation are you? Make it fun and viral. I think it's a little Claude. I like the other ones, which are, like, 5 hidden benefits of x, y, or z. Proof of concept, Yeah. I think you know, modeling software, there's some of these, like, insulation heed, h e e d, and others, we can use Take their design and and show ROI calculations based on the energy saved But it's not just health, energy. It's health and comfort. Yeah. All these things. Like, what are all the things that are gonna be better about this house? And then try to compile it and then say, how much would you pay for not getting sick every summer? You know? And try to do that. Then documentation for green certification could be interesting. Complete ROI calculation is 36 3 d visualization, mock site visit Yeah. Groups visit others Yeah. Day 4. I'm not sure. WhatsApp friendly presentations. Instagram, case studies. So this is like them selling. Right? Yeah. So maybe it's like a presentation. That they share a video of with real contacts, That'd be kind of interesting. Maybe we could get them to pick their family home to design for or somebody in there close circle that they know so they can actually feedback. 3 groups present best elements. Which content got them engagement? From the throughout the week. Right? So we gotta post on day 1. So we Some good time to get the traction. Collected objections from the real world. Yeah. That could be interesting. Maybe the poster like, somehow try to collect not just excitement, but objections where they should be Designing for someone they personally know and get real objections. I like the idea of real. Real design for a real person. So having a case study model It's great. But maybe there's a way of connecting that case study with a real person's needs in home. Yeah. And then material building challenge pitch kit. Pitch kit sounds good. Practice visiting critics. Yeah. So they pitch the panel of judges, live social media coverage. I like that. Real clients Claude. And everyone should invite people somehow to this social media event. Launch design competition. Maybe we can build up to it. On each of the other social media things.

Design competition should include social media metrics in scoring\n3. Worksheets should align with standard architecture firm practices (BOQ, BIM, pricing, etc.)\n4. Groups of 4 need structure to ensure everyone participates\n5. Less focus on creating social media content during \"Sell\" blocks - more on actual selling/negotiation skills\n6. Connect to real clients - maybe design for family members\n7. Material personality test is \"Claude\" (I think they meant \"corny\" or similar)\n8. Build up to the design competition through social media posts throughout the week\n\nLet me revise the structure incorporating all this feedback, making it more practical and aligned with real architecture workflows.Based on your feedback, here's a comprehensive revision that better integrates real-world practices and addresses your concerns:\n\n## Revised Module 3: Heritage Innovation for Real Clients\n\n### **Core Framework**\n- Groups of 4, with rotating roles each day (Designer, Calculator, Documenter, Presenter)\n- Each participant works on BOTH: shared 150sqm case study AND a real family home\n- Standard architecture firm workflow using familiar tools\n- Social media as documentation, not distraction\n\n### **Workbook Structure** (Aligned with Architecture Firms)\n\n**Spreadsheet Workbook**:\n1. **Project Brief** (Case study specs + Real client needs)\n2. **Design Options** (Strategies comparison matrix)\n3. **BOQ** (Bill of Quantities with standard format)\n4. **Supplier Database** (Shared resource)\n5. **ROI Calculator** (Energy, comfort, health metrics)\n6. **Pricing Sheet** (Professional quote format)\n\n**Design Workbook** (Markdown/PDF):\n- Historic Principles Catalog\n- Modern Technologies Guide\n- Client Interview Templates\n- Objection Handling Scripts\n- Social Media Templates\n\n### **Enhanced 5-Day Structure**\n\n#### **Day 1: Foundation & Real Clients**\n\n**Learn (90 min)**\n- Beit Turath thermal tour\n- **Story Circle**: \"Inspiring architecture for Mosul's future\" \n- Analyze Module 4's \"Study the Past, Build the Future\" examples\n- Start **Principles Wall** from stories\n\n**Apply (120 min)**\n- Introduce 150sqm case study\n- **Real Client Assignment**: Each person identifies a family member/friend's home\n- **Rotating Roles**: \n  -

      "content": "Okay. Yeah. I like this. I like having the so firm's, approaches. I like the idea of groups of 4, but you can tell me, would it be better in groups of 3 or 5? So we can either do 4 groups of for groups of 5 people or 5 groups of people or, like, 6 groups of 3 people 7 groups of 3 people. Yeah. And the question is if every participant works on shared 150 k square meter case study and a real family home Does it get confusing, get distracting? Should we orient them all towards one thing? For the design competition, saying that you know, everyone's working on this person's case. Here's that home. Then it would be, nice so you you have some comparison. But it might also be more interesting if they actually pick someone that they can actually call and talk to. And it could be a friend. And if they can't find anybody, then they can use I don't know, somebody in the class or I'm not really sure. There's, like, a pros and cons for each, but I I I feel like having somebody that's out of the classroom that they can get real feedback from and you know, you don't have to pretend it's it's better. Like, real is better. And we can get a case an architecture firm. Right? We can just tell the architecture firm, say, give us something you're working on. And we will design for that. But That then means that we don't get real feedback from the person. So we need some kind of pros and cons and deciding, but I do feel like having 2 different things is a little bit distracting. Like, The case study and the real family home might be too much to think about. I do like showing the rotating rolls. Or parallel roles. Right? So person a sketches the initial design, client needs, historic precedents and documents process, and then they kind of work together to bring it all together. Maybe there should be a lead know, someone in charge of putting things together and then if we have 5 days, that lead could rotate so that everyone gets a chance to to lead, and be one of the many So there is the designer. There's the, Claude researcher. There's The material history and technology and you know, process researcher, and then there's the documenter. Right? Documenter is probably going to be the one who's in the lead. Right? Document, collect, and support the rest. Maybe that could work. Role play gathering real needs, not just technical specs. Yeah. That's great. It could be role play, or it could be they call the real person. Although real time in Claude, if the other person doesn't pick up is a little bit challenging, so role play could work. To simulate that I think we need think of all the criteria, pros and cons. And make a decision about real design imaginary, like, iOS square meter design. Role play, or real clients, or maybe it's a mix, but how do we make it very, very clear without confusion? Okay. Day 2, all intervention strategies with ROI data. We can share that. How do we make it more interactive, though? Either lead or others And I think importantly, connecting, it's a need. Right. Okay. And then each individual develops one approach. I liked it when you actually broke it down into, like, the different roles and what they did. So for day 2, we're gonna calculate the BOQ for each strategy, ROI, 2 or 3 best strategies to combine. The lead could do that. Pitch pedals. Okay. For day 2, let's see. Each person pitches their strategy. Team goal, most convincing. Create Instagram account. So okay. I like that. 90 minutes. Hopefully, we can actually do all that in 90 minutes. Maybe we we have the we do the 5 hundred benefits first because if we go into the pitch battle, we'll go over time potentially We don't want to, but we wanna make sure that they can even show their 500 benefits They could even do that. Quick pitch and then show the benefits. Day 3 materials and money. Touch test compare. What is VOQ? Learning about VOQ. Payment structures in. Yeah. That could be interesting to get. Supplier calling, supplier database, Yeah. It could be interesting to talk about, like, supplier databases and having a shared resource that they can use later. Yeah. We could practice. Negotiation with the supplier on day 3 and also negotiation with the participants and how to be convincing and manage objections, Yeah. The visual arounds You know, why paying more is paying less, or better materials save money. Okay. So I don't know if Day 4 is just professional documentation, but I like the idea of the days being related to the roles as well. We were describing. So maybe it's, You know, 4 main days with each role. And then the 5th day iOS sort of, like, putting it together and the design competition the the the smaller competition or it's 5 days with 5 different roles, think about the 2 different way ones, and let's see which one works. And I like that idea where, you know, every day, that role might be the lead And they fill out the document. Right? For the shared group. And then for day 4, apply. They can visit each other's clients. They model energy savings. See, for both projects, it's too com complicated. I think that needs to be one project. Pricing sheet could be good. 60 second video case study for the cell section. Real client contracts, real objections. Yeah. Real is good. Define pitch based on feedback. Go to Instagram story showing process. I like that. Process. Maybe there's another way of doing it. And it could be something about, like, ROI different ROIs, how much would you pay for And then it incrementally adds the different features, shows the total price of the home, and the total, lifetime cost of the home or something like that or operational cost. And just as you scroll, you see, like, the price barely goes up, but the total lifetime cost goes down. And then you say, how much would you pay for And then there's, like, a list of all the benefits or something like that for the the final design. I'm not sure if that's the best way, but something like Okay. Design competition kickoff maybe is day 5. Review all collected objections and solutions. Social media analysis, Top 3 teams present. That's it. Competition rules. Okay. Yeah. We can share that. Share the analysis. I think the most important thing is review all call like, objections and solutions. And maybe I'm not sure actually what we're learning here on day 5. Maybe we'll figure that out once we do the the roles alignment thing. Small physical demonstration. I like the idea of doing real things physical that they can even take home or everyone could have something at the end. And they can take pictures of and put it on social media. Maybe we should do more physical, real things. Pitch kit. I like that you have a pitch kit with all materials. Something that when they graduate, they'll be like, okay. I'm gonna get a Claude, just gonna use this thing because it's really good. It's gonna help me you know, show them all of the the the b o n B0Q and the materials and you know, I can just show them this document that is where I download all of their information, the number of people in their family, the case. And I just have this packet. You know? What's the packet that we're helping them build? Live Instagram coverage is cool. But besides that, what else could it be? K. And then competition launch. Yeah. Sounds good. Day 1, abcd Okay. Let's go for it.",
