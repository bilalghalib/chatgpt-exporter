      "content": "Here’s the most up-to-date picture of how food is entering Gaza today—and the enormous challenges in getting it to the people who need it:\n\n---\n\n##  Is the food getting into Gaza today?\n\n- **Yes**, aid is entering Gaza—but **extremely insufficiently**. A famine has now been officially declared in Gaza City and surrounding areas, with over half a million people facing catastrophic hunger navlistFurther readingturn0news19,turn0news20,turn0news21.\n\n- Agricultural and fishing industries inside Gaza have been all but destroyed, making the population almost entirely dependent on external aid citeturn0news19turn0news21.\n\n- Since late July, Israel has allowed more humanitarian and **commercial food** into Gaza—but the volume remains drastically low citeturn0news19turn0news30.\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Routes: Are They Open?\n\n- **Land crossings** from Israel (like Kerem Shalom and Erez) are **partially open for aid and limited commercial deliveries**, although still heavily controlled and unpredictable due to approvals, inspections, and security concerns citeturn0news30turn0search38turn0search34.\n\n- **Sea routes**: A ship carrying **1,200 tonnes of food aid** from Cyprus reached Israel’s port of Ashdod a few days ago. The UN, via World Central Kitchen, is coordinating its transfer to Gaza citeturn0news26.\n\n- The **Egypt-Gaza border (Rafah Crossing and Salah al-Din Gate)** remains tightly restricted, under Israeli control, and not a reliable route for humanitarian access citeturn0search37turn0search35.\n\n- Temporary routes such as **Gate 96** and emergency crossings have seen some use earlier in the conflict but are not central today citeturn0search38.\n\n---\n\n## Who Brings It In, and Who Sells It?\n\n### 1. **Humanitarian Agencies**\n- **WFP** continues daily food convoys—recently delivering about **350 truckloads** in a week, though that's barely half the planned number citeturn0search16.\n\n- **Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)** and **Samaritan’s Purse** are distributing nutritional packs (enough for ~5,000 children for a month), though logistics remain chaotic citeturn0news19.\n\n- The UN, World Central Kitchen, and other groups are delivering bulk food supplies, often through Ashdod and then by truck or coordination with local distributors citeturn0news26turn0search13.\n\n### 2. **Commercial Imports**\n- Recently, Israel announced it’s allowing **approved private merchants** to import basic items—food, baby supplies, and hygiene products—with monitoring to prevent funds from reaching Hamas citeturn0news30.\n\nHowever, even when commercial goods enter, prices are sky-high due to scarcity. Aid often doesn’t reach the poorest:\n\n- A UN/OCHA report notes that **around 90% of the food trucked in** is intercepted before reaching proper distribution points—by looting or armed groups citeturn0news19.\n\n- In areas like Deir al-Balah, gangs and profiteering merchants are selling rationed or donated food at exorbitant prices—e.g., **$60 per kilogram of flour**—putting it well beyond people’s means citeturn0news32.\n\n---\n\n##  Summary Table\n\n| **Aspect**           | **Status**                                                                 |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Border access        | Partially open—aid and limited commercial allowed but under strict control |\n| Main aid sources     | UN agencies, World Central Kitchen, GHF, Samaritan’s Purse                 |\n| Commercial imports   | Permitted via vetted merchants, but very limited                           |\n| Internal distribution | Severely disrupted; looting, gangs, inflated prices hamper delivery 🙂       |\n\n---\n\n## Final Word\n\nFood **is entering Gaza**, but **not nearly enough**. Aid volumes remain critically low, and restriction of aid, stolen supplies, and profiteering continue to worsen the crisis—making famine both avoidable and unfolding at scale.\n\n---\n\nnavlistFurther readingturn0news19,turn0news20,turn0news21",
