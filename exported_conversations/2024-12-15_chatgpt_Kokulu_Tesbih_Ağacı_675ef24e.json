      "content": "The wooden **dhikr beads** you are referring to are likely made from **oleaster wood (Tesbih ağacı)** or a similar type of aromatic wood, such as **juniper, boxwood, or sandalwood**, which are often used in Turkey for prayer beads. \n\nGiven that you describe them as slightly green, the material may also be **olive wood** or beads made from fresh wood treated in a way that retains some of the natural color and scent. In some cases, these beads are infused with oils or are made from woods that naturally have a subtle, pleasant aroma when rubbed or warmed by the hands during use.\n\nIf you're specifically interested in purchasing or identifying them, they are commonly sold in bazaars or specialty shops in Turkey under the name **\"kokulu tesbih\"** (scented prayer beads).",

Another possibility could be **prayer beads made from perfumed wood or plant resin**, which are crafted to release scent during use.\n\nAnother specific material might be **Yemen Akik** or **Pistachio Wood**, which can sometimes appear greenish, but pistachio wood beads are rare. Alternatively, they could be made from seeds such as **Ruhsari beads**, which are unique and sometimes carry a mild scent.\n\nIf you can recall more details, such as the type of fragrance or any particular feature (like whether they were glossy or matte), that could help narrow it down further!",

      "content": "If the beads are definitely wooden, slightly green, and have a natural scent, they are likely made from **kuka wood** or **juniper wood**, but with some additional treatment to retain their greenish hue. However, since you've ruled out juniper, another strong possibility is **tasbih beads made from fragrant boxwood** (known as \"Şimşir Ağacı\" in Turkish), which can occasionally have a greenish tint if not fully dried.\n\nA more specific option could be **sandalwood variants** or a less common Turkish wood called **Hatmi Ağacı** (mallow tree), known for its slight greenish hue and pleasant natural aroma. \n\nAnother rare possibility is that the wood is treated with natural oils or resins during the crafting process to preserve its color and enhance its scent.\n\nIf you're certain they're greenish and not commonly found, they may come from a **regional specialty wood** like **olive or pistachio**, treated to maintain a fresh appearance. Many authentic Turkish tasbihs are handcrafted in small workshops, and the wood selection can vary by region.",
