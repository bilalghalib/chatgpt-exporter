It implies we must know about ourselves, our abilities, and our limits and understand the knowledge landscape. It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers, instead of approaching them to produce answers themselves, aided by the tool.  To use LLMs effectively we must understand them deeply, understand learning deeply, and to map between learning needs and the architecture and mechanics LLMs have that open up different affordances. \n\nIntuitively we can do this through a simplified geometric representation of a goal and a knowledge map and some intuitive leaps. We are approaching this practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nWe believe it may be possible to have  a one to one map for the production of data points, which leads to information, which is then refined into knowledge both within the human mind as a learner, as well as within leverageable structures within LLMs. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination. \n\n\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nSince last December after hundreds of hours of GPT use the following framework has been developed. Finding first the principles that led to better results with Large Language Models (LLMs) and then later formalized through the lense of cognitive science, adult development theories and research into transformative pedagogies for learning. The guiding question has always been to identify the leverage offered by the fundamentals of how LLMs work - embeddings and concept clusters and transformer attention mechanisms, and to identify the opportunity space made by these two new vectors for learning. Of particular interest to the author is how LLMs may offer individuals pushed to the margins due to migration, economic impoverishment, being born in the wrong country, or otherwise - and how they may be able to identify the limits of their understanding in contrast to others who’ve been given every advantage to explore, to experience, to be mentored and through this to develop a vision, build understanding and capacity and finally to be able to act upon their dreams\nBalaji Srinivasan, author of the Network State, describes “dark talent” - the idea that through networking we can find extreme talant anywhere then support and network them into a powerful State beyond borders. This idea superficially sounds possible, yet upon further consideration good ideas do not come simply from numbers of brains alone. Exposure is critical. While there are many definitions for intelligence, the one that appeals to me most is the one proposed by Douglass Hofsteader in his book Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire as the ability to abstract and generalize from specific instances into concepts that become manipulable in an uninterpreted way. For instance the moment you hear something it’s either a noise or a sound, a sound you can say has an isness - an implication, hooked into an idea, a noise is something that must be interpreted. That immediate translation from auditory input into categorization likely develops like our other senses, and it’s for this reason I propose we may be more likely homo-sensorious than homo-sapiens, since thinking is seeing. The process of taking sensory input, conceptual input and deriving a new “one of those” is a process humanity does individually and collectively. Youth are often at the forefront, as GenZ slang demonstrates copious examples. \nLet’s talk about being “Based” - which originated as a way to describe someone who was “freebasing” drugs, which itself is a created concept based on the idea of acids and bases, transforming amines, usually basic, into their neutral counterparts to alter their consumption methods and impacts. Now, for GenZ, being based simply means “not caring” - and it’s very likely the majority of people using the word have no understanding of the chemical processes underpinning the origin of the word. And most chemists likely do not know that the word, base, comes from the greek pedestal due to it bening the structure upon which an acid rests upon when making a salt (The Origin of the Term “Base” by William B. Jense 10.1021/ed083p1130). \n\nWhy did we take this long detour into understanding the origins of ideas? It’s to make it clear that there is more than superficial language connecting human intelligence with machine intelligence, and that by exposing how a machine learns to a human, we can transfer some of the millions of dollars and effort spent running millions of words across the attention mechanisms of LLMs to the most marginalized learners on the planet. Making it more likely that they could be one of the “dark talents” that will come up with the idea that will deeply and positively impact their communities and our world. The network state should seek true diversity for it to make true on its promise, otherwise we will have a silicon valley state with Berlin, Beijing, Paris, Silicon Valley, New York, Porto, Dubai, Bangalore and other cities like these being over-represented, and not due to their population count. \nTo increase the possible surface area of ideas crossing minds that are able to merge and encompass I believe we need to create structures to support what is already common in transformational learning to be the foundational elements of pre-training and fine tuning of our LLMs and then to make them universally available on smartphones, it’s estimated that by the end of 2024 7.1 billion people will have a smart phone totaling nearly 88 percent of the human population(including infants).\nWhile we’re waiting for openAI and Anthropic to integrate machine-human transfer learning into the core of their offering, we have options:\nSupport the development of the ways of being that inspire prompting along the framework described below. \nTechnological supports: Build grammarly-like plugins that highlight non-optimal uses of LLMs and offer suggestions of improvements to increase machine to human intelligence transfer. \nDeveloping customized system prompts that align with the person that will maneuver the LLM to being more transfer and transformational in its dialog. \n\nThese two ideas:\nTransfer and transformation hint at what I believe to be the key insight underneath much of this argument, that we can learn best when we learn in symbiosis with a machine that learns in similar ways (concept clustering). \nSalience is the sense that things are meaningful and make sense, when you write a poem referring to your infant child as the light of your life, she doesn’t become photons, yet you may sense the rightness of this analogy. When taking certain entheogens one might start reducing their critical thinking allowing them to make analogies that are further off from reality. This lamppost reminds me of my highschool history teacher’s handwriting - perhaps. Yet how helpful is it for them, let alone others? Only God(swt) has the highest analogy, truely being able to see the oneness of everything - to hold that in total comprehension. We are reduced to analogies that are “useful” - yet the true geniuses are those that continue to expand and encompass till they are able to hold more things in the light of oneness. This is the process of meta-cognition. The ability to dive into the uniqueness yet zoom out into the unity at will. This in/out process is what enables the building of patterns across truely related concepts that those inside the concept space might not be able to see. \nThis is how pattern recognition is possible. A developer at a certain level of mental complexity may think their job is to provide code that achieves a goal - contrast this to a CEO making a decision where they may need to be able to see the interrelationships between being a father, a ceo, the company in the context of the economy, the economy in the context of global cultural shifts against capitalism, the international climate and how it relates to a decision between stainless steel and aluminum.\nThis level of thinking is more related to a why than a how. \nMachines are more and more able to take over the how, and normally mental complexity and human transformation that leads to it arises after many years of “one of those”ing many situations, building experience throughout life. Is it possible to develop and transform and grow in the true sorts of comprehension that allow someone to see and know the why behind things, the thing that touches the indeterminate gut intuition, the sense of rightness, the value that one knows through their emotions, the feeling of beauty that arises when the right thing emerges. \nThis is a “zone of genius” - this is everything one knows and an element of the ineffable, what exactly is a beautiful idea? How does one make a decision at high levels of abstraction? I believe that it’s similar to the physicist who chooses the more beautiful equation and finds this “trust” is rewarded. Or as G Hardy says: “The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.” Why?\nWhile one may dive into controversial territory speaking of God or Truth. I believe we can stay within the realm of the philosophical and logical. We see that salience is possible to artificially enhance, that moment when someone on a psychoactive substance senses they just found the meaning of everything and they write it down only later to find it’s something like “the stars are beautiful, and I am a star” or some other phrase that doesn’t quite pack the same punch. This is related to the difference between a two dimensional matrix True and false and permanent and transitory. There are moments in our lives when we are able to go a level above our mental complexity and we glimpse the world from above, like a flatlander in 2 dimensions being pulled into the third dimension and can finally understand the topology of 2 dimensional shapes, that all the differences he sees in triangles and squares and octogons, that really, in a sense that is hard to build when you live in 2, they’re all the same, a single line encompassing a space - all essentially circles. \nTo gain an intuitive understanding of the sort of space of inspiration needed to build new knowledge, let’s study this picture carefully:\nWhat does it look like it represents? \nImagine you produced this image through this process:\n\nTry to determine the structure of the material in the place of the green shape in the image above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Would you have guessed a corkscrew?\n\nWe now know what DNA looks like, I can only imagine the AHA moment Rosalind Franklin had when she made the connection between all the data. I also wonder if she also decided to use the frame of a twisted strand because it was beautiful. If only she was alive today to ask.\n\nThis realization that we find throught science and mathematics, that beauty is a trustworthy guide may have evolutionary origins, although there is no reason that of all the ways the world could have worked that it should be this way.\n\nI believe that a good human life is connected to this source of knowledge, the source where we know beauty and align ourselves and our actions with it. It’s not to become a bootcamp developer or whatever is the current trend in education. The how will be automated, craft remains since craft remains tied to purpose and beauty.\n"

Conclusion (5/5\n\n\n\n\nI. Introduction\nIn a world that often prioritizes external achievements and metrics, it is easy to overlook the fundamental importance of inner development and self-reflection. However, by examining the basic principles of human experience and growth, we can come to understand that the most meaningful and lasting change begins within. This essay will explore the primacy of personal response and inner states, the cultivation of enduring positive states, the role of inner work in authentic change, the value of supportive relationships and tools, and the alignment of actions with values and aspirations. Ultimately, it will argue that a more compassionate and harmonious world is possible through a collective commitment to inner development.\n\nII. The Primacy of Personal Response and Inner States\nAt the core of human experience lies a fundamental axiom: the only thing an individual has direct control over is their ability to respond to external stimuli and internal states. This principle is self-evident and requires no prior knowledge or experience to understand. It is the foundation upon which all personal development and growth must be built. However, it is important to recognize that an individual's capacity to respond effectively is dependent on their current state of being. A person who is overwhelmed by stress or consumed by negative emotions will find it more challenging to respond in a way that aligns with their values and goals.\n\nIII. Cultivating Enduring Positive States\nGiven the primacy of personal response and inner states, it follows that identifying and cultivating states that result in preferred ways of being is a primary means of personal development and growth. In the Islamic tradition, this process is understood through the concepts of \"hal\" and \"maqaam.\" A \"hal\" refers to a fleeting positive state, such as the boost of energy and optimism one might feel after a cup of coffee. In contrast, a \"maqaam\" describes an enduring positive state, a way of being that persists regardless of external circumstances. The goal of inner development, then, is to transition from fleeting positive states to enduring positive states, to cultivate a sense of peace, compassion, and resilience that remains constant in the face of life's challenges.\n\nIV. Inner Work as the Foundation for Authentic Change\nThe cultivation of enduring positive states is a necessary foundation for creating meaningful and lasting change in oneself and the world. Authentic change and growth arise from an individual's inner work and self-reflection, rather than external factors or interventions. This principle is logically sound, as any attempt to create change without addressing the underlying states and responses of individuals is likely to be superficial and short-lived. By focusing on inner development, individuals can build the capacity to respond effectively to challenges, to maintain a sense of purpose and direction, and to create positive impact in their lives and communities.\n\nV. The Value of Supportive Relationships and Tools\nWhile inner work is a deeply personal process, it is important to recognize the value of supportive relationships and tools in facilitating growth and development. The quality and depth of an individual's relationships and connections are essential determinants of their overall well-being and capacity for positive impact. Supportive relationships provide a space for reflection, feedback, and encouragement, helping individuals to navigate the challenges of inner work and to maintain a sense of perspective and purpose. Similarly, platforms and tools that support inner development and self-reflection, such as journaling apps or meditation programs, can be valuable resources for personal and collective growth.\n\nVI. Aligning Actions with Values and Aspirations\nAs individuals cultivate enduring positive states and engage in inner work, it becomes increasingly important to align their actions with their deepest values and aspirations. The alignment of an individual's actions with their values is a critical factor in creating a sense of purpose and fulfillment. When individuals act in ways that are congruent with their beliefs and goals, they experience a sense of integrity and authenticity that enhances their overall well-being and effectiveness. In contrast, when actions and values are misaligned, individuals may experience cognitive dissonance, stress, and a sense of disconnection from their true selves.\n\nVII. Towards a More Compassionate and Harmonious World\nUltimately, the cultivation of enduring positive states and the alignment of actions with values has the potential to create a more compassionate and harmonious world. As individuals engage in inner work and develop a greater capacity for peace, resilience, and purpose, they naturally begin to have a positive impact on those around them. They become better listeners, more effective communicators, and more compassionate leaders. As this process unfolds on a collective level, with more and more individuals committing to inner development, the cumulative effect has the power to transform communities, organizations, and even entire societies. A world characterized by greater compassion, collaboration, and harmony is possible through the collective commitment to inner development and the cultivation of enduring positive states.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the path to meaningful and lasting change begins with a recognition of the primacy of personal response and inner states. By cultivating enduring positive states through inner work and self-reflection, individuals can build the capacity to create authentic change in themselves and the world. Supportive relationships and tools play a valuable role in this process, as does the alignment of actions with values and aspirations. Ultimately, the potential for a more compassionate and harmonious world lies in the collective commitment to inner development and the cultivation of enduring positive states. It is a vision that requires no prior knowledge or experience to understand, only a willingness to engage in the lifelong process of growth and self-discovery.\n\nTLDR: A transforming world needs transforming people. \n\nTo help people transform is working on the only thing anyone really has actual control of, inner states and how we respond. We can support inner states with coffee, or meditation, or good community or dancing - these states can become permanent with enough practice. The state is the place from which we have the ability to choose how to respond. Thus one of the few places we are given free will is in a moment of clarity to choose to find a friend group that takes you dancing, or to start a tiny habit which can grow into a meditation practice, etc. By choosing the states which give access to reason, we can enable the noble parts of our character to be that which responds.\n\nWe cannot actually “just stop oil” - we can build the movement, the community, the states which lead to heads of oil companies to decide differently, for people to choose to bike. We should not measure biking, we should be measuring that which leads to biking and then secondarily look into the biking. \n\nThe reason for this is because if we look at what we expect goodness to be, we will miss the thousand things that are good that we didn’t think. Also, by measuring it and asking people to bike vs getting them into a place where free will has leverage (good state, good knowledge) then we will see something beautiful. This is what I mean by surprise and why I like surprise. \n\nIt’s related to humility. A humility that comes from the realization of a truth that was hard won - I have no idea what good looks like. I know bad, for sure and that things must change, yet how Good will come about, what it could be instead of what I think it is, wow! How cool is it to have a life like this. This fits in beautifully with our pedagogy. \n\nSurprise me, think for yourself and show me what I couldn’t have thought of myself because you are there, you are touching the issue. \n\nGood knowledge does include knowledge of how others have solved the problem. It does include skills for sure, or at least knowing what skills are needed and bringing people into the team if they don’t have it. So education and having frameworks and community building is all essential. Yet it should not distract ourselves from the fundamental issue of transformation of individuals in empowering communities. \n\nThese communities can become communities of outward and inward support. \n\nMaybe the one measure during the program can be, how many people do you truly love in this cohort? \n\nAfter the program: how many people do you still love and stay in touch with. \n\nLove will create collaboration. Love is behind the care to ask the question of how can I help. Love will make the space for vulnerability where someone can say: I’m stuck and I don’t believe in my project anymore. \n\nAnd for me, this is the most beautiful thing we can do. So I guess beauty and surprise (which references awe) are my higher values. The sense of beauty I get when I see people who love each other use their lives to create beautiful things for others. The equation can be\n\nLove + Service = Beauty\n\nDon’t look too closely for reasons similar to quantum effects\nYou can't measure the energy or position of a quantum oscillator with precision. \nSimilarly, we can't measure specific measures without influencing a person's moral reasoning and damaging their moral agency. \n\nI would rather value mentorship quality and subjective experiences like \"aha!\" moments than strict measurements. These qualitative elements which are outside the purview of artificial intelligence are essential to the development of entrepreneurial self-efficacy because they are based on genuine values inquiry and a profound comprehension of oneself and the outside world.\n\nI don't think one person can make a worldwide difference on their own. Furthermore, I make no claims about what an all-around better world would entail for every person. Since the world is complicated, I think the greatest strategy is to give people more power. People's learning processes, social skills, and entrepreneurial development should be our main priorities. This entails encouraging them, supporting them, coaching and mentoring them while also having faith in their choices.  It's important to start by understanding our own purpose – the 'Why' that drives us – and then explore deeper questions like 'Why was I born?' and 'What am I meant to do?' This is why my essay touches on theological themes. I believe that our differing perspectives on humanity and the universe are fundamental to understanding ourselves and the world around us.\nOnce we agree on these principles, I believe we'll also agree on the specific measures and projects to pursue.\nLet's now discuss a few queries: Do we need to use a taskboard?

I'm curious to learn more about that … \n\nHadith:\n\nIt was narrated that Abu Dharr said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, how many Prophets were there? He said: \"One hundred and twenty-four thousand.\" I said: O Messenger of Allah, how many of them were Messengers? He said: \"Three hundred and thirteen, a good number.\" I said: O Messenger of Allah, who was the first of them? He said: \"Adam.\"…\nNarrated by Ibn Hibbaan, 361\n\nAlso … I'd be curious what most Muslims think about that.  \n\nMuslims believe in the concept that everyone is born with a natural inclination towards submission to the will of God, which is termed as being \"Muslim\" in its original sense. This innate disposition towards recognizing and submitting to the divine is seen as inherent to human nature. However, it is through the influences of upbringing, societal norms, and personal choices that individuals may adopt different belief systems or paths in life.\n\nCentral to the understanding of Islam is the recognition that all prophets, from Adam to Muhammad, were inherently \"Muslim\" in their submission to the will of God. They served as exemplars of devotion, humility, and obedience to divine guidance. Their mission was not to establish a new religion called Islam in the modern sense but rather to call humanity to surrender to the Creator's reality and embody mercy and compassion in their lives.\n\nIn essence, the message conveyed by all prophets is universal: to submit to the will of the Creator, to transcend personal desires and ego, and to manifest divine mercy and compassion in our interactions with others and the world around us. This entails embracing the qualities of forgiveness, kindness, empathy, and justice in our daily lives.\n\nTo enact our part in manifesting divine mercy on Earth, it is essential to cultivate a deep connection with the Creator through prayer, contemplation, and adherence to moral and ethical principles. This connection serves as a guiding light, inspiring us to emulate the prophetic example of mercy and compassion towards all beings.\n\nUltimately, the journey of submission and enacting divine mercy is a lifelong endeavor, requiring introspection, self-discipline, and a commitment to serving humanity with sincerity and humility. By embodying the teachings of mercy and compassion, we contribute to the realization of God's mercy on Earth, fulfilling the timeless message brought by all prophets throughout history.\n\n I hope you are getting what I'm trying to say, I'm explaining this religious stuff in such detail once you get through this part. \n\n\nSufism and Taoism: A Comparative Study of Key Philosophical Concepts by Toshihiko Izutsu | Goodreads\n\n\nWe realized we were Muslim. Why call Muslims who were atheists or of another faith \"reverts\"? \n\nIt was their society that conditioned them so, and then when they became Muslim, they \"reverted.\" It's like pressing control alt delete and rebooting the system to the original settings. This is something of preference, as you can see from the discussion here: A Convert or a Revert? How It Does Matter\n\nThis \"everyone\" is born Muslim till their culture shifts them from the innate Fitra (an essential concept). It means the natural way like all things are already in submission to God. Fitra (comes from the word for mushroom, by the way) \n\nOh, it might be interesting to note that all things in nature are submitting and in constant worship all the time, so you can consider your cat or the evergreen tree you're hugging to be a \"Muslim\" in that regard. This is also an orthodox belief. Also, it's believed that prophets and saints could hear their constant praising. \n\nIt's in the Quran directly and very explicitly:\n\n\nSurah Al-Isra - 1-111—Quran. com says all things in the universe are in worship and praise, yet only we cannot understand.\n\"Some prophets, like Solomon, are believed to have possessed the ability to communicate with animals. For instance, the Quran narrates a story where Solomon heard an ant warning her fellow ants about his approach. This incident illustrates the Quranic concept that even animals possess a level of understanding and intent, as the ants were aware of the potential danger posed by Solomon's presence.\"\n\n\nSo not only does every human community get a messenger, and not only is everyone on earth born human born in the innate natural state (note this is important for later when we get to Goodness and unlocking human potential), but all animals are already \"Muslim\", and not just that, they talk and have communities. This is directly from the Quran, Surah Al-An'am—38—Quran. com.\n\n\n\nThis is a foundational orthodox belief across Sunnis, Shia, and any sect you can consider since it's foundational and in the Quran. \n\nThe foundation of the Muslim tradition is like an \"upside-down pyramid\" (ho ho ho), with three layers that take you from basic action to belief to spiritual insight and faith.\n\nFor me, it's important because it's the process of submission of your will (physical, this is Islam/prayer/fasting/etc. follow in this regard) and then belief; in the Quran, it says that animals have communities. Do we have faith in that? Shouldn't that be verifiable? Well,\nGuess what? Using AI to Decode Animal Communication with Aza Raskin (youtube.com) Haha!\nI met this guy at the OnBeing conference. He's a long-time friend of Joe Edelman and is currently closer to Tristan Hariss, who was also at the OnBeing conference.\n\nOkay, now that we have this foundational information—that everything is in submission to God—it's important to note something about this God. First of all, what do we know about God? Well, one thing is, should we start with the Quran? What if we aren't there yet in terms of our ability to accept that content as foundational? Well, for me, I see my baby when there's no harm or hurt. The world is beautiful and full of laughter and love. \n\nMany people find solace and healing in natural environments, especially those that have been untouched by human hands. \n\nThe natural world is in perfect equilibrium and harmony, and when disequilibrium happens (forest fire), things adapt and return, and everything is in its proper place.\nThis idea of \"right place\" is called adab. \n\n\n\nGod is the origin of all things, and thus, if there is anything in the world that is ugly, it is due to the imbalance, as one knows beauty when one sees it, and often beauty has elements of balance and proportionality, perfection, elegance harmony, rain, growth, death, refresh, rebirth, these things are the natural fitri way. Seeking unlimited life, unlimited wealth, or unlimited power puts things into disarray because it breaks the scales of balance. Lions don't have refrigerators; this is why they won't kill All the deer in one night. \nWe do; we have fridges full of food that goes bad while neighbors go hungry because we are not in balance and trust.\n\nThe Prophet (S.A.W) tells us, in language very similar to his \"brother in preaching the tradition of submission :\n“If you were to rely upon Allah with the reliance He is due, you would be given provision like the birds: They go out hungry in the morning and come back with full bellies in the evening.”\n\nSunan Ibn Majah 4164 - Zuhd - كتاب الزهد - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)\nThe difficult thing is that this requires so much faith; it's said that the Prophet rarely slept with a dinar in his house overnight before giving it away in charity, knowing that provisions will come the day they're needed and due. That's faith. \n\nThe beautiful balance we are describing is something that humanity can align itself with. Adab, doing the right things or putting things in their rightful places is how we return things to balance, which God commands us to do in the Chapter of Mercy:\nSurah Ar-Rahman - 1-78 - Quran.com \n\n\n\nThese verses from Surah Ar-Rahman (55:45-47) eloquently portray the intricate balance between divine favor, mortal existence, and the eternal sovereignty of the Lord. The rhetorical question \"Then which of your Lord's favors will you deny?\" serves as a poignant reminder of the multitude of blessings bestowed upon humanity, urging reflection on gratitude and recognition of divine providence. The subsequent assertion that every being on earth is destined to perish starkly contrasts the impermanence of worldly life with the eternal majesty and honor of the Lord, emphasizing His enduring sovereignty. This juxtaposition prompts contemplation on the transient nature of human existence and the eternal significance of the Divine, encouraging believers to align themselves with divine guidance and strive for righteousness in their actions.\n\nWhy is the fact that this is in the Chapter of Mercy so important? Well, since God is the ultimate source of creation and uncreated and capable of all things, we need to understand that over ALL things is God's Mercy. In a way, we have to accept a fundamental principle that of all things that happen, good/bad, it is impossible to say God is punishing out of anything other than Mercy because this would break this logical statement:\nSurah Al-A'raf - 156 - Quran.com\n\nGod's Mercy encompasses everything. \n\nAlso, know that the Prophet's mission was to be the recipient and teacher of the holy book, the Quran, God's verbatim, uncreated word of God. (How it was uncreated—that's a whole theological discussion, haha!) \nAnyhow! So here we see THE POINT.\n The point is to be a mercy to all things. In the chapter of Mercy (which comes from the womb-like Mercy), RHM raham is the womb, and Rahman is the Most merciful lord. It's the most often repeated word in Muslim prayers. It's what we start all things with, Bismillah al Rahman al Raheem. It's the only \"non-paired\" name other than Al-Iah (Allah swt)  (The God)\n\nGod tells us his \"true\" name - the one that is Truly One - just as he is. The foundational principle of creation and how he relates to it is this: \n\nI guess they translate it to compassion. Just know it's the word \"Al Rahman.\" Here, it makes it equivalent to the word God and permits humans to call him by one or the other.\n\nIt's the only name of all the 99 different attributes, which includes \"difficult\" attributes like The Just and the Avenger; what most Muslims believe and teach their children is this:\n\n\nSo, here we are, finally, the worldview that Muslims have that underlies some important philosophical reasons. I think of structuring our programs a certain way and measuring them differently than you do. \nThe world is created by God, who is The Most Merciful, and all things that happen in this world happen under his power and influence and thus are all also acts of Mercy (if we know it or not)\nAll things are in perfect harmony (the sun and the moon, the cyclical nature of the seasons, the ebb and flow of predator pray populations, etc.) because they are in submission and trust in the most beautiful and merciful. Even a mother lion killing and eating a gazelle is doing an act of Mercy for her baby cubs. Only when one exceeds is one out of line and \"sins.\" Sinning is going out of balance in the way of nature. \n\nThe \"Fitra\" is the way we are naturally inclined towards:\n\nBabies are altruistic because they haven't been conditioned yet. Altruistic babies? Study shows infants are willing to give up food, help others | NSF - National Science Foundation\n\nAll things in the universe are in submission (a state of \"Islam\" the act, not the religion as defined in the English dictionary) \nSubmission leads to balance: up a bit one day, down a bit the next. Muslims are encouraged to close shop if they make enough money in one day. \"Seek the extra provisions, but do not rely on them. Rely on Allah. Allah has destined your rizq (wealth/provisions). He is the Provider. Wealth is like a medicine. If you take more than the right dose, it might be fatal. You might overdose on it.\"\nWhen we realize we are Muslim, we can then follow this path: Islam->Iman->Ihsan (belief and action -> belief in the unseen stuff (books/prophets, etc) and then finally being in witness or being a witness of the Divine and through this perfecting your adab/qualities.\nWhen you do that, you become like the created leaf with no will other than the will of God, as we read in the hadith: the eyes with which God sees…, the hand with which God strikes, etc. You have subsumed your will. Now, that's a high status, and that's what the Sufis and others who want to purify themselves go for. \nThe important thing is to understand that we have a part of ourselves that desires things more than the balance requests, 20 wives, cheating on our partners, a mountain of food, and unlimited wealth so we can become powerful and … uhh… enact good because we're smart enough to accumulate so much wealth we must know what is good.\n Here is one crucial difference between how we measure and why I prefer small being beautiful. If you can assure me that the person is in balance at that scale and in pure submission to the will of God, then let them be wealthy beyond measure. The Prophet Solomon and others from the people living with the Prophet had wealth. \nYet more often than not, people who aren't working on their hearts daily will not be able to pass the \"test of wealth\" - most people can, and it's likely easier, be patient with poverty. Handling wealth well is more challenging because it is likely that we are not going to be in perfect harmony and balance, which is beautiful.\n\nOkay, we have some premises already.\n\nHumans are fundamentally good because a Good God created everything under his Mercy. When humans operate in a wrong way, it is due to a scarcity mindset, fear (whispered by their lower selves and the devil(yes, Muslims believe in this guy too, yet ) \n\nSurah Al-Baqarah - 268 - Quran.com\nExcept instead of the devil being an evil, annoying thing that whispers \"Killll KILLLL KEEEELLLL\" into your ear, he makes you remember poverty and worry and fear and thus accumulate wealth beyond measure and wind up breaking the balance of justice. \nWhy is that evil? Well: Link Between Wealth and Suicide Rates (businessinsider.com) \n\n\nSo, now what? \nLet's dive a bit deeper into what Islam/submission is, what it implies, how it supports fearlessness in the face of poverty, and how this brings about the unlocking of honest Goodness and positive action for our brothers and sisters. \n\nAlso, we need to understand why I believe it is more important that our programs change people within than create change in the outside world. \nThis is important because of the purpose of creation. Why is all this here? I believe that we are not here to have a beautiful life where we all dance and party. If we could dance and party in harmony for eternity, we should design things to do that, as Aubrey Degray and other people working on curing death might lead us to want.\n\nWhy do you think we are here? If you could have an IV drip of MDMA along with all humanity so our fear is suppressed and we can create AI systems that manipulate our desires to map the needs of the world (fewer babies, perhaps, more babies if the economy is slumping) \nThe bottom of the pyramid is Islam; some say it has pillars, so it's like a house with these pillars.\n\nBelief, Praying, Fasting, Charity, Pilgrimage \n\nTo be a Muslim takes 5 seconds; all you need to do is believe and then say that there's only one God and that he didn't leave us alone and sent us many prophets and the final one who's responsible for all people on earth right now is the Prophet, Muhammed. \n\nMuslims believe if people have had the opportunity to learn about Islam (Submission) and then refuse it because of arrogance or a refusal to contemplate it seriously because they're distracted by their own whims or desires and ignore the reality of death and ethics, then you have refused. Yet, lots of people suggest that God is not unjust; most people today, especially on Fox News in the West, see the face of Islam as a murderous sect, and the image people are given is so corrupted that it turns their hearts away from what should be a natural and pure truth.\n\n Thus, they are excused and forgiven as well. If you believe in Oness and you have not heard of the Prophet (I assume lots of indigenous peoples fall into this). In that case, you are still considered a muwahid and likely to be forgiven and entered into heaven as God is not unjust. If one is given the truth clearly and honestly and then refuses out of arrogance or taqleed (just wanna do what my family or society or my whims say), then they are those who have rejected.\n\nThat's Islam (submission); once someone says the Shahada declaration of faith, they're a Muslim, and no one can say no, even if they drink and don't pray and still don't know much about the tradition.\n\nIman (faith) is essentially the next level. If you believe in a God who doesn't leave us alone and he sent messengers, you grow in faith, and that encompasses what you're probably curious about:\n\n\nFinally, the final layer, after you submit, your will realizing that God is one, and learning about the fact he didn't leave us alone and sent us many messages to teach us about belief, the prophets and their ethical moral stories, about the reality of what comes after death, and in predestination (the patience machine). You get to Ihsan, which has cognates with words for beauty. \n\nIt's described like this:\nhttps://40hadithnawawi.com/hadith/2-islam-iman-ihsan\n\nThen he (the man) said, \"Inform me about Ihsan.\" He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, \"It is that you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet (know that) He sees you.\"\n\n\n\nOne way Muslims think about \nSalafi's focus is on the outward, the practical, and the focus is on the house. Do these things or else.\n\nIslam (practices, fundamental belief to say you believe) (outward)\nIman (belief in angles, all the other prophets, life after death, predestination, etc) (inward) \nDanger, Sufism beyond here. People who want to purify their hearts focus on the \"roof.\" They focus on the love of God, and God tells us how to love him:\n\nA hadith through the Prophet (S) on behalf of God (SWT) called a Hadith Qudsi (a Holy Speech):\n\n\"My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with extra non-obligated acts of worship so that I shall love him. When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and if he asked Me for refuge, I would grant him it.\"\n\nThis letting go of oneself and becoming an instrument of God on Earth has a clear progression:\nIslam->Iman->Ihsan \n\nSo why do I explain all this? Well, because I believe the fundamental inspiration behind the pedagogy and the work that has brought Bloom such praise and enthusiastic fans is derived from my understanding of humans from a Muslim perspective. \n\nAfter articulating my foundational beliefs and reflecting on the driving forces behind my work, I am compelled to ponder a fundamental question: Are we here to save the world or are we here to be saved by the world? This existential inquiry delves into the core of my philosophical outlook, especially when considering the resilience and profound transformations experienced by individuals facing adversity, such as the courageous people of Gaza. \n\nDespite enduring unimaginable hardships and loss, they emerge with hearts purified by their trials, serving as a testament to the intricate interplay between human agency and the world around us. This reflection highlights the reciprocal nature of our relationship with the world, where both saving and being saved are integral aspects of the human experience. It underscores the interconnectedness of our actions and the environment, emphasizing the potential for mutual growth and transformation.\n\n \nSurah Al-Inshirah (94:6-8)\nThis verse from Surah Al-Inshirah (The Expansion) offers profound insight into the nature of human experience and the divine promise of relief during times of adversity. It emphasizes that hardship is inevitably followed by ease, highlighting the cyclical nature of life's challenges and comforts. When individuals face trials and difficulties, they are reminded that relief and solace will ultimately follow, providing hope and reassurance in the face of adversity.\n\nHere's another Quranic verse emphasizing the importance of patience:\n\"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:155)\nThis verse acknowledges the inevitability of trials and tests in life but encourages believers to remain patient in the face of these challenges. It promises glad tidings and rewards for those who demonstrate patience and perseverance during difficult times. \nThis verse suggests that despite the hardships faced by the people of Gaza, their unwavering faith assures them of eventual recompense for every trial endured. Despite losing everything and undergoing profound tests including fear, hunger, and the loss of wealth, their hearts remain resolute with belief and infused with spirituality. This resilience is attributed to their profound faith (eman), which sustains them through even the most trying of circumstances.\n\nThis verse offers a perspective on the inherent balance in the human experience. It suggests that while individuals may encounter hardships and trials in their journey, these challenges are not insurmountable. Rather, they are part of a larger divine plan where difficulties are followed by moments of ease and tranquility.\n\n\n\nBilal's Axioms:\n1-People are fundamentally Good.\n\nReligion or not, if I didn't believe this, I would not want to be alive on this planet. \n\nGoodness is an active force and does not remain within people; babies want to smile, neighbors want to help each other move, and lovers give massages. The reason the world isn't full of Goodness is because of blockages from hurts, wounds, and wrong interpretations, which cause people to horde wealth, withhold love, and fear the other - and sometimes for a good reason, although for usually cyclical reasons. The \"aggressors\" themselves were hurt initially. \n\nMy life's mission to \"unlock human potential for positive change\" is to find and address those blocks and create the proper context to help people identify that beauty and Goodness within and remove friction for them enacting it in the world. \n\nHelpful things to realize here are trust, faith, fearlessness, humor, a positive interpretation of reality, or desperate acknowledgment that a negative interpretation is self-referential and self-destructive. \nBilal's Beliefs on the nature of Goodness and where things become religious and not simply a rigorous philosophical framework:\n\nGoodness is the nature of Reality because God is Good. Goodness in people, the creative motive force, our sense of justice, and all things that \"bring us to life\" come when we touch the divine attributes. \n\nGod has 99 of the most beautiful names and qualities, and those qualities are latent inside humans. Most people have one (signature strength) that wants to come forth through them more than others. (See image for names on the following page)\n\nBy learning about yourself as a child, as early as possible, before wounding, before being corrupted  \n\n\n\n\n\nIhsan (belief in your ability to see/be seen by God and in this witness causing all your actions to be purified and perfected because wow. God?!? (elevation, which is what Sufi'sSufis are known for) \n\n\n2.⁠ ⁠As for Abdallah Rothman, I want to talk to him about values-oriented entrepreneurship education in the UAE, culture shift, values, etc.… both in general and about things we can do together. \n\n\n\n3.⁠ ⁠As for \"small is beautiful, \"… interesting thoughts, though I disagree with the basic premise. Writing a book, working on culture stuff, budgets in the range of billions, technology, etc.… I think values can be connected to many of them. I think the main issue is \"values\" rather than \"scale.\" The combination was popularized by people with a different value set, profit-maximizing, not caring about people or the environment, etc … \n\nBG: I concede yes, for sure. A book is small and a humble approach to impact billions (and so it's true, the Quran has, as has the Bible and The Way of the Tao, and the Baghavad Gita, etc.… \nThe question I have is, are we at the level of the Buddha? \nAre we receiving divine revelation? Have we let go enough to write this book with the right mental complexity and open-heartedness? I do not believe so, if only because if we were, we would do what we thought was 100% correct without compromise and without consideration for funders or budgets. \n\nAs for being able to fathom a billion dollars in a budget … I think that's definitely possible when broken down into tangible impacts on people's lives. $1 billion would give 1 million underprivileged university students $1000 for their education, etc., and we can talk to a bunch of them to see how the $1000 helped, etc. \n\nlet's delve into the distinctions between things that are released and not influenceable versus those that are maneuverable and influenceable, particularly concerning values and their impact on scalable endeavors.\n\nThere are entities in our world, like books or technological inventions such as a combined harvester, which are released into the world upon creation and subsequently operate beyond direct control or influence. Once released, their outcomes are largely determined by their inherent design or functionality. However, there exists another category of entities, such as technological platforms or social movements, where ongoing maneuverability and influence are possible. These platforms allow for constant learning, adjustment, and modification to enhance desired outcomes and mitigate undesired ones. Within this realm, values play a pivotal role.\n\nConsider the example of blitzscaling, militarized drones, or atomic bombs—technological advancements conceived and executed with varying values in mind. These innovations were brought into existence by individuals or entities guided by different sets of values, resulting in diverse impacts on society and the world at large. Thus, it becomes crucial to deliberate on how to foster and support endeavors driven by positive values and cultures, particularly those that are scalable.\n\nIt is imperative to direct our focus toward nurturing scalable initiatives that embody positive values and cultures. These initiatives encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from significant undertakings like movies, technological platforms, and cultural or religious movements to myriad smaller contributions that collectively contribute to larger positive transformations.\n\nIn essence, the pursuit of scalable endeavors with positive values entails a conscientious effort to prioritize ethical considerations and societal well-being in all facets of innovation and progress. By championing initiatives that align with virtuous values and cultures, we can collectively steer humanity toward a future characterized by compassion, equity, and sustainable development.\n\nI also like the idea of maintaining a connection with the people, the participants, the community, etc. This can be done for bigger or smaller things. \n\n>> BG: Interesting. I think I'd like to sit with your disagreement in a Google doc and actually reason by principles about it. \n\n>> DMN: Cool sounds good … and yes, good things there to think about. ?I think it's exciting contemplation, and I like the idea of feeling the human connection, but that also doesn't need to all be *me* feeling it to learn from it. \n\nSomething is interesting about culture, religion, or governance systems… systems, functioning systems, changing systems, etc. \n\nIn many ways, I believe in the importance of \"local governance\"… systems where people know and feel the impact of their decisions at a closer level (closer to the home). Still, other things are important and work better at a larger level (the state/region?), even larger (the country?), and even larger (international/universal / humanity / etc). \n\n~\n4.⁠ ⁠Regarding the next steps on the framework stuff … yes, I love it. Great progress on that. And sure, I would love to continue thinking about that stuff. \n\n~\n5.⁠ ⁠Regarding the next things for us … I think we should use the available overhead funds as efficiently as possible to help us move toward revenue generation. I don't think it should go to the backlog for either of us at this point (I think the backlog owed to me is probably now 3-4x more than owed to you … so that would consume all our current minimal savings and wouldn't help us move forwards) … \n\nWe have suggested focus areas for you in the OrgDev doc at the bottom of page 3 and the top of page 4.

(Bootstrap question) \nQ, DMN: is it because the library is weak? \n\nA, Bilal: Perhaps. Although selling white labeled versions of Bloom where we digest your learning library and make it actionable and fit in the DB, and also make matching assessments by reverse engineering (get the \"portfolio/evidence, make badges, make questions that lead to them) sounds like something we can make/sell right now that would be awesome. And the value add of credentialing and helping organizations make marketing material while simultaneously providing portfolio/evidence-based badges sounds like a triple win where the 'why do we have to take assessments' is answered with something valuable for everyone. \n\nDMN: We must improve our standard templates for \"what's a good library item\"… \n\nBG: Instead of a template, we can make a reviewing prompt and a script that uses it against our library to produce a report. To do this requires 3-5 good examples and some careful design; I suggest I do this and build it as a learning experience for our team. In this way, we can both have a rubric and also something that can give us a first-pass judge of what's wrong and a first-pass recommendation of where human hearts and minds need to focus. \n\nDMN: Would you like to look into that? Can you train an AI to format content for our Library of Activities? \n\nBG: Absolutely. That can be my weekly activity. It can also be where I include aligned evidence for all assessments—as long as we're there, we're there. \n\n\n\n\nDraft Text by A.I. after transcription:\nFirst Draft:\nDear Munir, \n\nIn our work, we often discuss the importance of measuring progress and tracking tasks on our taskboard. While I agree that these tools are necessary for organization and accountability, I believe that the true essence of our mission lies in the transformative moments of presence and \"A.H.A.\" that occur during our live facilitations.\n\nWhen fully engaged in the present moment, we create a space for our participants to connect with their presence and access a deeper level of understanding and self-discovery. These \"A.H.A.\" moments are the sparks that ignite fundamental transformation and growth, and they cannot be reduced to mere checkboxes on a taskboard.\n\nI remember a particular live facilitation where a participant had a profound breakthrough. As we guided them through the process, I could see the light in their eyes as they connected with a truth that had been eluding them. That moment of insight and clarity was life-changing for them, and it reminded me of why we do this work in the first place.\n\nWhen we tap into this deeper level of presence, we align ourselves with a greater sense of purpose and service. We become conduits for transformation, not just task managers.

Together, we can find a way to measure our progress while still prioritizing the magic of presence and \"A.H.A.\" moments.\n\nWith gratitude and respect,\nBilal Ghalib\n\n\n\nSecond Draft:\nDear Munir,\n\nIn our work, we often discuss the importance of measuring progress and tracking tasks on our taskboard. While I agree that these tools are necessary for organization and accountability, I believe that the true essence of our mission lies in the transformative moments of presence and \"A.H.A.\" that occur during our live facilitations.\n\nWhen fully engaged in the present moment, we create a space for our participants to connect with their presence and access a deeper level of understanding and self-discovery. These \"A.H.A.\" moments are the sparks that ignite fundamental transformation and growth, and they cannot be reduced to mere checkboxes on a taskboard. It's like in our systems that we're designing, there's a thing between, you know, creating a moment where a human is with themselves and a piece of paper, and they're taking an assessment, or, you know, on the phone or whatever, and they have an A.H.A moment. They commit in front of a colleague, their mentor, or one of their peer peers from the program, and then they're like, \"Yeah, I took this assessment. It made me realize this, and I will do this from now on.\" And I've decided to change them.\n\nI remember a particular live facilitation where a participant had a profound breakthrough. As we guided them through the process, I could see the light in their eyes as they connected with a truth that had been eluding them. That moment of insight and clarity was life-changing for them, and it reminded me of why we do this work in the first place. And, you know, like whatever it is, those moments of commitments, those moments of being witnessed, of togetherness, that's a great use of technology, right? And in terms of impact, let's count it by seconds. The rest of their life, the seconds are now in our impact bank, right? You can count on that, especially if they have confirmed their promise or if it was a deep enough moment.\n\nWhen we tap into this deeper level of presence, we align ourselves with a greater sense of purpose and service. We become conduits for transformation, not just task managers. By prioritizing these moments of \"A.H.A.\" and presence in our work, we honor the intangible, life-affirming experiences that define the success and impact of our mission.\n\nI understand that measurable progress is essential, and I'm not suggesting we abandon our taskboards altogether. However, we need to find a balance that puts the transformative power of presence at the forefront of our work. It's that moment right then and there with him, and it's present, and it's true, and it's real. And when you witness that, it's different than a recording. We need to acknowledge that and look at all of our recordings. Which ones have ever helped anybody versus which sessions have ever helped somebody? One is scalable; one we can put on WhatsApp and fast forward to a thousand people, and the other, you kind of have to have been there. And there's a thing about that - the moment, the presence, and the reality. That is also a part of what I'm getting at.\n\nPlease consider these philosophical differences and explore how we can create a working environment that honors both the mechanical aspects of our work and the life-changing potential of our live facilitations. Together, we can find a way to measure our progress while still prioritizing the magic of presence and \"A.H.A.\" moments.\n\nWith gratitude and respect,\n\nBilal Ghalib\n\n\n\n\nFreeform thought transcript:\nAlright, I'm going to do a really brief download because I feel like we had a great conversation. I am still reverberating, as I say it, with what we said, and so I'm going to try to get some thoughts out before I lose it.\n\nSo, I think one of them was around this idea of surprise and how, because of the VUCA world that we've been talking about for ages, I think it's essential to be a little bit more, \"Ah, humility is another thing that I believe is like a core value.\"\n\nAnd it leads me, it's like humility, you know how I was always like, \"Oh yeah, love of learning is my thing.\"\n\nAnd then I realized that when I love learning, it doesn't bring me to life, and you have to look deeper.\n\nThe thing that probably is bugging me about the different perspective isn't that it's just a different perspective; it is that it's like a value of humility that is missing, but humility is what leads me to value surprise.\n\nHumility is probably due to a different belief, which is why I think something about my belief system. I'm not sure what Mounier's belief system matters, and actually, one of the things I'm wondering about is how I got to that deep of a level.\n\nIt's not just your values; it's like how those values touch your perspective.\n\nFor me, many of my thoughts come from the Muslim tradition, which I think is the tradition of what I call \"Qataba today.\"\n\nIt's like the natural, the national realness.\n\nAnd yeah, this idea that people have this divine spark is really core to the concept of lighting a fire instead of filling a pail.\n\nSuppose you think in reductionist terms that there is a brain and that there's a mechanical world that humans are adapted to advantageously design systems around them to get fat and procreate more. We are winning the world because we're like that and can do it better with better systems. In that case, we have to get smarter and figure it out all of us in the world need to realize that in this dynamic, complex, crazy system, we have no idea what we're doing every time we put something in and so whenever you try to measure something it's basically like you're stepping on a water bed. You're trying to write on it while people are walking.\n\nAnd this is what Mounir is doing.\n\nSorry, please delete this.\n\nBut you get it?\n\nI'm not crazy, right?\n\nI'm not crazy about this, but I think that people are trying to reduce the world to something that one can comprehend.\n\nAnd once you can do that, you can control it to control the environment.\n\nLike, I'm sure maybe Mounir would be pro-climate control in terms of putting a bunch of, you know, would it sulfur into the air to reflect something or something?\n\nI don't know, like some people are there like we built it, we can rebuild it, and it'll be better.\n\nBut I think that instead of trusting a few people with a lot of resources to do these big-scale things that impact the ecosystem in such a horrible way if you think about it, the problem with the environment comes from the fact that wealth is controlled by such a small fraction of the population. They have outsized control because they think they know what good looks like and good looks like businesses. Initially, it was businesses where they did well, then businesses where they did well. Others do well enough, and then it's businesses where they do well, and others do well enough, and it supports the world and the planet that it's on, but it's still under the control of a few people.\n\nAnd that's what happens to complex systems is that they even more unpredictable when you have large outsized levers.\n\nAnd I think that maybe this is me and the whole vision that I have of a thousand flowers blooming, and the super bloom is not to have like a hundred billion dollar companies in the Middle East where they can then reinvest. We have the PayPal mafia, and they're trying to create the next generation of the hundred billion dollar companies, the Forbes 100 changes so dynamically all the time because people are vying for those billion-dollar spots, and the world changes.\n\nI don't think that's what I want.\n\nI think there's beauty in the small and the close, in the personal, in the meaningful, and in the humane. We have scale because we have the capacity for technology, but I also feel like technology needs to be within arms' reach.\n\nSo, for instance, it's essential that we invent the wheel.\n\nIt's a good invention.\n\nTechnology.\n\nAwesome.\n\nLove it.\n\nI think it's perfect that we invented the hoe.\n\nEven like the thing with the wheel and carriage on the calf.\n\nAwesome.\n\nIt lets us feed more people, and you can still touch your values and see them in action in the world.\n\nYou run over a cat while you're pulling the hoe.\n\nYou will cry.\n\nYou will be more careful next time.\n\nToday, we have combines that can tear up hundreds of acres in a day and are hundreds and hundreds of meters across.\n\nYou can't see the end when you're driving, and you're probably tearing up like thousands of cats, and you will never know.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat's just one.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd then there's like all sorts of technologies that have this kind of outsized reach where farmers are committing suicide instead of farmers becoming friends with their neighbors because they rely on each other, and there's so much respect for the skill and the witnessing of nature and the ability for a farmer to feed you versus a farmer that is destroying the earth for a short-term profit knowing that they won't be able to do it their whole lives to fund some Monsanto giant corporation.\n\nAnd this is this is this is scale.\n\nThis is where I need help with technology.\n\nThis is where it goes from okay, valuable, cool, and wonderful to too much.\n\nAnd I feel like in our systems that we're designing, there's a thing between, you know, creating a moment where a human is with themselves and a piece of paper. They're taking an assessment, or, you know, on the phone or whatever, and they have an aha moment. They commit in front of a colleague, their mentor, or one of their peer peers from the program, and then they're like, yeah, I took this assessment. Let me realize this. I will do this from now on, and I've decided to change them.\n\nAnd really, you know, like, whatever it is, those moments of commitment, those moments of being witnessed, of togetherness, that's a great use of technology, right? And in terms of impact, let's count it by seconds. The rest of their life, the seconds are now in our impact bank. You can count that, especially if they have been true to their promise. If it was a deep enough moment, people have near-death experiences, they're transformed for life. People go visit, what's his face, and the power within Tony Robbins; they're changed for life. That happens, I know, I met people like that, and it's changed them. And we can do that, that's possible. And Tony is slightly scalable; he writes books, he has his, you know, 'Waking the Tiger Within,' 'Empowering the Power Within,' or whatever it is online where he has screens in a giant circle around him, and people are on Zoom. \nBut he's there, and it's his time, and it's limited. It's that moment right then and there with him, and it's present, and it's true, and it's real. And when you witness that, it's different than a recording. And I feel like we need to acknowledge that and look at our recordings, all of them. Which ones have ever helped anybody, versus which sessions have ever helped somebody? And one is scalable, one we can put on WhatsApp and fast forward to like a thousand people, and the other, you kind of have to have been there. And there's a thing about that, the moment, and the presence, and the reality of it that I think is also a part of what I'm getting at in this subtle, like, linear versus dynamic, or linear versus sfumato, if you want to go Italian, or like, lingerie versus full frontal. I don't know which one to call it, but like, this approach that I've been talking to you about and thinking about, like, why, how I feel like I differ.\n And I'm just gonna, okay, I'm using count this as the thing. I might even send this as a part one and tell you not to listen to it. I didn't see, for me, like, recording to myself is very different than having a persona in mind. And that's the thing that's, here's another really important thing, Mr.\"\n\nRogers when he was doing the T.V. shows, said that every time he looked into the camera, he had a specific child in his mind. He didn't just record videos. He was recording for someone. You can't for anything, which is where your humanity shows up for a stand for something when you're creating an autonomous system that doesn't include your human element, and for me, like when I came to Lebanon, I tried to do both like I was with Munir on the scalable stuff because it's essential. I also love the facilitation. I wanted to create a dynamic learning experience rather than a linear learning experience where people can do the right thing at the right time. Actually, you know Munir the way I wonder if you know how everything started but Munir was like can you run an entrepreneurship program?\n\nHere's our program, and it was basically, you know, the business model canvas or something in a linear way, one after another, kind of boot campy or, I don't know, it was something. And I had this realization that, like, you know, we don't have to do it like this. Not everyone needs the same thing from everyone else. I think even Taro said this, like one of the problems that they were having. I was asking people what are the problems of the programs. Like, not everyone needs the same thing. And so, because I'm an aerator, I'm like, 'Okay, well, how can we make it so people can do different things at the same time?' And that became pitch-worthy, and it became boom.\nThe initial framework, the initial structure was like the pitch deck. It's like the thing that gives the person the complete information as much as possible, or at least it should, you know, the most important components. And so, if you do that right, you do everything well, right? So, once you get that right, that's why it's pitch-worthy. It'd be worth pitching if you get that right. And then it comes to the personal and interpersonal because you have to work on yourself to be able to pitch. You have to.\nAnd so, I found, I thought that was like a really leverageable moment, and I'm glad to see it still is there, actually. It's like the boot camp leads up to a pitch. The sessions, all of them, right? Like, it's there. It's not moments of together in a live way that the transmission of the idea happens. The question happens where the realness of what you're doing is palpably felt and is how people make decisions, right?\nI think it's really important, you know, and it's related. And you can even see that the intuition inside of the ecosystem has adapted, right? Of course, they always say they invest in people, not the product. They don't invest in the thing because a transforming person, not a transformed person. I think we need to change that language. It's like a transforming person continuously, a verb, is going to be able to do things differently, you know?\nThey're going to be able to be quiet as Joe is in the other room doing an interview for a job. A transforming person, you can see their trajectory. And this is kind of why I wanted to bring you onto the board earlier rather than later because I could see your transforming nature, and I could kind of see the direction. I was like, 'Yeah, that's what I want to go to,' you know?\nAnd, yeah, so I have been reflecting on so many things, and I'm going to take a pause here and then try to start again. I'm just going to tell you not to listen to this just in case I lose this audio.\n\n\nOkay, yeah, so continuing the thing that I've been trying to parse is, like, what is the relationship between the way that Muneer wanted every assessment to make these levels move on the entrepreneurship scale from beginner to end in this linear sort of way, versus that being his intuition of good, total like the bar chart, what percentage of people in our programs are moving towards an exit versus my perspective of encouraging people to internalize the scriber framework and then disappearing until they need us or watching from afar and collecting stories of impact and being surprised 10 years later and making sure that it's true, it's real, it gets implemented, it's trained well, and it's actually helping, but it's about respected as well.\n\nAnd this is like an upside-down pyramid is really like some of these other values that don't sound fun, like humility, respect, you know, the things that your dad might say, those are the things that I feel are, sorry, I don't mean your dad, I mean, you know, like not so fun and love, humor, joy stuff, which is also essential but like, I do think that the thing that might be different is this respecting people, because they contain a flame that is worth fighting and to watch and to be in witness and awe, and to be in the uncertainty of what that person will do.\n\nAnd, of course, to help them guide, help them learn how to guide themselves, connect them to new ideas and new things, inspire frameworks, help them expand their view of what's possible and what's important, tell them to value the parts of themselves that they don't value necessarily and to help them realize that that is potentially what businesses need so that when they apply when they start their business, they can say hey, I'm bringing humor and it's worth it, or hey I'm bringing humility, and it's worth it, you know, and to talk about, these are like simple ways of talking about these things, and this is not want to talk about values, and we'll talk about values in a more prosperous way.\n\nBut even in this simple way, the basic idea is coming across.\n\nAnd so, I feel like this difference might fundamentally be a difference in our perspective of what a human being is.\n\nAnd I think I think it's clear from how I talk and do programs and design things that for me, there's something precious there that needs to be respected and trusted, and that the other important thing is that God, to me, isn't a once and done God and that he didn't create the universe and step out and that we're here. It's mechanical; everything clicks and clacks and goes forward. The deterministic and even like quantum is like opening some weird doors for people, but even then, they're like, yeah, it doesn't have any real say for what happens in this world, and even if you can figure it out, once you figure out the quantum world it's just another just weird click, click, right?\n\nIt's like, okay, so that was entangled in that way, and we're creating quantum computers. You can see that even this, like quantifying the quantum and practicalizing the uncertainty of that weird world, is just another type of reductionistic perspective.\n\nBut in my worldview and in the listening worldview, I think many tribal and native people like there to be continual unfolding and new, right?\n\nAnd that new, you can, you go, and I think that's why you are in awe when you see something majestic; it's the first time you've ever seen it.\n\nThe first time the baby held his foot, he was in awe; I swear you could see it in his eyes.\n\nFirsts are always awful in the best of ways, so when you have humility and acknowledge that you trust somebody, that's the other thing; that's where love comes from, too, right?\n\nAs you say, hey listen, so here's the framework, here's how you teach yourself as I believe in your goodness, and I think that you can figure out the qualities that you were born with that make you who you are and that you can figure out how to bring that out into the world in a beautiful way.\n\nIf you have leadership qualities and are inclined toward that way, I believe that you can form a team of people around a beautiful vision.\n\nAnd if the vision is beautiful enough, you'll do the right thing.\n\nAnd we don't even have to use the word social enterprise. You know, we use the ability for people to recognize their sources of beauty and their skills and to motivate them and inspire them to act.\n\nI feel like this is how learning works, right?\n\nYou have a thing that you direct yourself towards, and this is why, sometimes, we might not know why we're learning, right?\n\nWhen you like a person, you suddenly learn a lot about the music they like and the backgrounds of the countries they visited, or, you know, it's because of love, right?\n\nOne thing.\n\nAnd so the other thing is because in our world today, you need to eat food and have a stable life and structure.\n\nThe way that we do that today is by exchanging value for money.\n\nAnd I think the challenge and the important thing is to look at this.\n\nAnd I think this is why earlier entrepreneurship education is more valuable.\n\nWhen people are in high school or college where somebody else is paying for things, they will need to figure out how to answer that question.\n\nBut if they can really know who they are and be in that transforming state when they leave college, I hope they don't have to compromise like many people today.\n\nSo many people today wind up going into, what do you say, like day trading.\n\nI know people who were super bright and loved math.\n\nThey had a talent and a divine skill, God-given, you could even say.\n\nI can sanitize my language of the word God if you prefer, but that's one simple and, for me, true; we just have to define God.\n\nBut still, God-given the talent to do mathematics, and I wanted to pursue it.\n\nThey told me that I was going to go to the stock floor in New York and work for X number of years.\n\nAnd then I'm going to get back to it.\n\nJust to pay off my student loans.\n\nAnd so these things like student loans, pressure from parents and family, these exogenous motives that aren't in AIDS corrupt the ability for someone to see clearly the question that God asked with their birth.\n\nAnd this is entrepreneurship in some way that entrepreneur is like, Who am I?\n\nWhere am I here?\n\nWhat skills have I been given?\n\nBecause I really believe that, fundamentally, the thing that makes life really meaningful is giving all that you can with all that you are and feeling used and valuable.\n\nLike the blessings that are infinitely showering down on you, the fact that you have this billion-person ancestry makes it possible for you to live in this moment, where you can take a train from Turkey to Paris and fly to New York, taste the foods of the world, and have a family to hold your nieces or nephews' hands like there's just such beauty, right?\n\nThat you've been given, we've been all given.\n\nAnd I think that there's gratitude for sure.\n\nAnd then also, what can you do to contribute to creating beauty and to doing that most meaningful thing for others?\n\nAnd sometimes that looks like you're a researcher because that's how you best utilize the things.\n\nAnd sometimes the things that were given to you from birth, and that you've, you know, whatever your early life experience, there's this, you know, they say that there's this moment of Elysium, right, the river and that when you die, you're reincarnated, you come back, you have all of the world's knowledge, but then you drink the waters of Elysium, and then you're born again.\n\nAnd that's where it all ends.\n\nBut I really think that there's everyone gets shaped into this unique crystal of, you know, however, your parents traumatized you and whatever society that you grew up in, the ideas that you've had and the innate inclinations that are, you know, partially biological, partially, you know, divine in origin, or just who you are, whatever that is, right?\n\nAll of that comes together before you're aware of it.\n\nIn my opinion, the waters of Elysium are the last sip of mother's milk because that usually starts coming when there's a little bit of awareness beginning to peak up, and you're there—you have arrived.\n\nAnd so that little kid, three or four, I don't know how old, that very little kid, I think has the qualities, maybe six, I don't know, but it's like this early childhood.\n\nThis is why I think maybe one thing we need to look into in our programs is Venso Shar's talk about her childhood.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I wanted to be an inventor.\n\nI've always had ideas.\n\nThis is me. I'm in my element when I'm coming up with ideas, implementing them, doing them, and nerding out like I'm totally in the zone. I ignore everybody, leaving me alone, and building stuff, you know.\n\nAnd if you look into your life, there's something like that.\n\nAnd I think, like, in the Muslim tradition, it says God doesn't do anything for no reason.\n\nAnd in the chaotic system that we're talking about, that is non-ambitious and locally relevant, where, you know, you don't optimize for the whole at the expense of the local, right?\n\nThat's what I think you could say that some people do when they're like, okay, screw here, I'm going to fly to New Zealand and get a bunker, but build a business that works internationally.\n\nOkay.\n\nNo, look at yourself.\n\nLook at your surroundings.\n\nThat's what the news is.\n\nThat's where the genius is.\n\nGenius loci was what genius used to be.\n\nIt's the genius in a space.\n\nIt's not a genius.\n\nBecause the person is so cool.\n\nLook, we put them on the pedestal.\n\nIt's the combination of everything right there that makes sense.\n\nAnd in Arabic, there's this thing called adab, A-T-A-B.\n\nAnd that's when things are in the right place.\n\nSomeone in the right relationship is in the right place, doing the right thing, using their gifts in the right way, and interacting in a relevant way within the context they are aware of.\n\nAnd then, if we take on this deliberately developmental framework and Leo, Theo Dawson, and P.I.J. and all that, you can realize that there are moments when it might not make sense for somebody to start an international business because they don't have the mental complexity to handle it.\n\nAnd we encouraging everybody to go big or go home destroys the possibility of people being mua-dabine, M-U-A-T-A-B-E-E-N, and being in the right place, using the skills for the right thing at the right time.\n\nAnd this ambition is the problem, which usually comes from something other than an innate place.\n\nYou know?\n\nFrequently, we would run programs, and people would say, \"I want to run a hair salon.\"\n\nAnd we're like, \"No, no, no.\"\n\nCan't you think of something scalable?\"\n\nNo, they shouldn't until that happens.\n\nThey should develop a hair salon that serves a real need, does it uniquely, and makes money.\n\nMaybe it's their kids that are going to go to school and be able to have the mental complexity for the other one.\n\nOr once they satisfy their fundamental needs, they can settle into a routine, and they start, I don't know, having evening hours for contemplating or reading, or they get exposed to different communities because they're now business owners, then maybe.\n\nBut we were trying to do that early because that's what funders want. After all, we want to impress investors.\n\nI don't want to impress investors unless they invest in transformation, not in the lining of their pockets too soon.\n\nI think investing needs to change.\n\nIt needs to have a different measure.\n\nIt's like I was talking about algebra versus calculus.\n\nYou don't just add, add, add.\n\nYou need to measure rates of change.\n\nSo, rather than an investor looking at how fast your bank account grows and how fast it's possible to get this return, I was talking to my friend Doug.\n\nAnd I like Doug, and I think he's smart, but I think he's really dumb at the same time about this particular thing: he really believes in the power.\n\nI may need to change my mind about this because I can see his point in the individual with a lot of money to do a lot of good.\n\nAnd that is what he wants to invest in because it creates the aristocracy of modernity, where people can do things that make no sense, like start a foundation.\n\nWe don't have the divine right of kings or aristocracy or the ability to enslave people officially.\n\nWe have to create structures that we own and that create outsized value.\n\nI think it's possible to do that in a good way.\n\nAnd I think Doug is that kind of person.\n\nAnd totally, it makes sense.\n\nBut I think incentivizing the entire ecosystem towards this end.\n\nFirst, one problem I see is that everyone knows capitalism needs to change very soon and must be restructured.\n\nAnd that pretending like we can build the same kind of businesses without creating wealth inequality that destroys the fabric of society that's already happening.\n\nIt's there.\n\nBillionaires are one of the most hated populations on the planet, even while their numbers keep growing.\n\nAnd I think there are some exciting things about the adab, like the right place and the right person who has the right kind of framing and structure, as well as the individual who can hold that space well.\n\nAnd it might be only held well in collectives.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI'm just thinking about this now, but I'm not sure I buy into this idea of scale, partially because of the technological element and the problems that we discussed above about expanding beyond your reach of comprehension.\n\nAnd then partially because of the systems that satisfy human needs.\n\nSo learning, returning to that as the core of what's happening, happens when there's an objective. Then, an individual explores, experiences, and reflects along the path toward the subjective.\n\nAnd so what is the objective?\n\nAnd this is why we start with why, right?\n\nBecause once you get the right way, an objective is right for you.\n\nI think that's another thing we should add to the start, which is why things need to be right for you.\n\nIt needs to be your why, not just start with why.\n\nIt's like starting with your why.\n\nWhen you get that, you will learn everything you need to know to achieve that objective.\n\nAnd if the objective is embarrassing to share in front of others, because it's like, well, somebody actually in my last cohort was like, I want money.\n\nThat's another reason you have to ask a couple of levels deep.\n\nAnd, of course, people want money.\n\nThey need money.\n\nWe're in a world where there's a lot of difficulty.\n\nThis is why, partially, I would be open to only working with college students and under and having that be a cap.\n\nAnd I don't think describing why we need this cap is a horrible idea.\n\nInitially, I wanted to change the world by getting people to do things.\n\nBut I realized that we don't know what those things are.\n\nAnd it's probably...\n\nLike if we had started with this vision 10 years ago, I would have been a youth back then, and it only makes sense now.\n\nBut if we started with this 10 years ago, today's generation would have failed the correct number of times and grown the right number of times in their mental complexity and capacity. That leadership could potentially be scalable and have a high impact and change the world businesses and their world businesses correctly.\n\nSo, I think I'm trying to develop a better language.\n\nIt's not that I don't like scale and want scale, as I want the right people doing things right for them.\n\nAnd that requires us to be more humble and trust rather than know what we want to see in the world, pay to make it happen, promise investors and funders that we will create X number of social enterprises that create Y number of impacted individuals, pull X number of people out of poverty, feed the hungry, and solve the climate crisis at the same time.\n\nI think I would instead measure those inputs rather than the outputs.\n\nLike, are we creating transformational experiences?\n\nDo we trust in the innate goodness of people, and do they feel committed?\n\nLike, how can we measure their commitments towards their why?\n\nAnd we ask them, is your why still? Are you still on fire about your why?\n\nYeah, why or why not?\n\nOkay.\n\nWell, if you're still on fire, what are you doing about it?\n\nAre you learning?\n\nWhy or why not?\n\nOkay, if you're not learning, do you need mentorship?\n\nDo you need community?\n\nDo you know yourself?\n\nThis is where we get into the inner work stuff.\n\nAnd so it's about something other than scale.\n\nIt's about the right person scaling at the right time in their life and being ready because, you know, you give a teenager a Ferrari, and they're going to kill themselves.\n\nDon't give a teenager a Ferrari.\n\nThey shouldn't even be in the car.\n\nWe shouldn't even encourage them to make crypto money to buy a Lambo, right?\n\nBut there are these kids out there.\n\nAnd I'm sure definitely, if I look, I don't want to.\n\nSome silly kid got rich in crypto and is dead in a Lambo.\n\nThat would be like the equivalent.\n\nThat would be the thing.\n\nThat could be the name of this.\n\nThis podcast or this blog post is Don't Put the Crypto Kids in the Ferrari or something like that.\n\nThat was 45 minutes.\n\nOkay, so I talked a lot.\n\nI talked a lot about a lot of things.\n\nI don't know, Dada, if I missed anything from what I shared with you.\n\nBut I will.\n\nYeah, transcribe this, cluster the concepts with A.I., and then follow the inspiring framework. By the way, it's inspiring.\n\nI'm so sorry.\n\nIt's evolving, and I'm getting deeper and deeper as I look into it and realize that we're really getting back to the fundamentals of research.\n\nThis is another thing of humility.\n\nIt's like, don't make things up yourself.\n\nRealize that you're aligning along a movement and a tiny part of a wave peeking your head up and realizing that you're an individual and a more significant thing.\n\nAnd this is why it's not about us scaling and taking over the world.\n\nImagine a tsunami.\n\nWe shouldn't be a tsunami.\n\nWe should be a wave that goes forth, nourishes the shore, leaves space for the crabs, and draws back out when the tide goes, and then somebody else is going to come in our place, and we're a part of this way.\n\nAnd we'll come back to, you know, maybe next year, maybe next program.\n\nWho knows?\n\nMaybe we do need to take this break.\n\nBut I really think that these intuitions about humility, trusting others, and being a part of a movement are already happening.\n\nInstead of Cree using our platform or us integrating with Cree or whatever, it's okay for there to be diversity.\n\nThe most beautiful world is the one where you see two birds that are almost the same, but they're different.\n\nEach of them has their unique qualities, and you love them.\n\nRight?\n\nAnd there are many people, and there's a lot of growing up to do as humanity.\n\nAnd I think we can be part of that if we're humble, respect the soul, and genuinely believe in people's fundamental goodness and their ability to sacrifice. If you think about it, working on change is to work on a mini-death.\n\nIt's like a very Jesus moment, right?\n\nIt's like, who do you need to become?\n\nAnd then when you do that, you know, the process of that, you're nailing yourselves to the cross.\n\nYou know, this is super. I figured it might as well: If I'm going to go all Muslim, I should get some Jesus style up here, too.\n\nYou know, I consider myself to be a Muslim and a very fitly, naturally oriented person.\n\nBut anyway, that's just my perspective.\n\nOkay, I'm going to work on something else now.\n\nAnd I'll let this simmer in my mind.\n\nAnd I'll listen to something else.\n\nAnd thank you for the call.\n\nThank you for the money and for actually bringing up the idea of being a co-founder.\n\nI think that's promising.\n\nAnd yeah, I should pay attention to his messages.\n\nI'm just at the point where I don't want to look and don't want to talk.\n\nAnd like when we had that call, and he was trying to do that alignment, I was like, Oh, no, yeah, this is not my place.\n\nThis is not for me.\n\nBut yeah, I think if you're right he's changing.\n\nAnd if you're right he thinks differently and wants to go slower.\n\nThat's another thing I wanted to remember to tell myself to go slower: raising enough money so that we can do the right things rather than the fast things because we think we can leverage that to do something else.\n\nI'm actually thinking about taking all of my savings from crypto, which I never touched because I'm like a 1520 30-year crypto person, and whatever it is right now, taking it out.\n\nAnd just like investing in me and spending more time working on the badges, I thought that could be cool.\n\nPay for an apartment, you know, for him to visit once a month, and I can only work with him in person.\n\nSo I would pay for that.\n\nOr to explore, like working with the boy or something else, and give myself space, right?\n\nAlso, I already paid advanced rent to Josephine for about four months because I don't want to worry about it.\n\nI want to be able to think, be free, plan, and do, and learn about myself, how I like to work, and what my role is in this world.\n\nObviously, a big part of it is talking.\n\nI hope that this isn't like arrogance or just too foul.\n\nAnd I hope that it's inspired because sometimes I do feel inspired.\n\nI feel like, where the hell is this coming from?\n\nYou know, you could give me a microphone and a topic, and I could go on for an hour.\n\nBut anything, I think, you know, because I would connect it to something else.\n\nI see within myself, and I'm learning as I speak.\n\nIt's the craziest thing.\n\nI feel this kind of trust in the Socratic method and the ability to discover something beautiful and unique in others rather than try to get them to conform to a scale.\n\nEven though I think we can do both right now,\n\nWe can build the bridge, and the glue is chagipiti.\n\nAnd I realized that Chagipiti has all of the past but not the continual present unfolding within me right now.\n\nAnd the less I go, the less I'm going to describe this phrase, these languages, these thoughts, the deeper I go and the less contrived and the less stuck on the past I am and coming from a moment of like deep stillness.\n\nI'm not orthogonally positioned to the rest of the vector spaces.\n\nAnd that is the gold of the future.\n\nAnd that is what we're trying to help the teams discover as their unique voice.\n\nAnd that is the right thing for them to say right now, not the right thing that an investor wants to hear because of the past.\n\nLet's leverage these large language models to bridge the qualitative and the quantitative by reducing the number of qualitative decisions and increasing the number of human interaction moments.\n\nAnd that measure is like quality human moments of human interaction.\n\nQ-M-O-H-I.\n\nIf you get it for a week, get their daily bread.\n\nYou only get your daily bread when you have a quality moment of human interaction.\n\nAnd you can get to that after you've exhausted your capacity to be surfing your growth edge.\n\nThe state of flow is for a person who has identified their why. They know themselves and understand the motives that might be exogenous or external.\n\nAnd they are on a developmental path where they realize this.\n\nAnd maybe that could be the next badge system.\n\nInstead of us trying to guess developmentally where people are, are they in a socialized state of mind?\n\nOr are they self-transforming?\n\nOr where on the scale can they hold a complex system and work on it because they have the mental flexibility to do that?\n\nOr should they be more in a tribal situation where they understand all their neighbors and they're going to sell them the boulangerie or get the coiffel?\n\nIf we tell people that this is an essential element and also tell people about stories of the failure points where successful people realize they had failed themselves because they didn't become, they followed a trend or something like that.\n\nAnd then also the money question is huge.\n\nSo, either, this is why I always wanted to try to turn our programs into cooperatives, where if anybody were successful, there would be a baseline salary when you came into the program.\n\nI know people think like an American would be like, that's not great.\n\nThat's not going to incentivize them to work hard and suffer.\n\nWell, that's because we're changing the incentives mechanism.\n\nAnd if people aren't incentivized by their why and they're not on fire, that should be the other thing we're measuring.\n\nIf they're not inspired by that enough to kill themselves or whatever.\n\n\nIf they're not inspired enough not to kill themselves, I really should not have said that, but like if they're not inspired enough to like to push and in a balanced way, realize, well, first of all, if they're not inspired enough by what they're doing, it won't motivate them to act.\n\nBut also, that inspiration sits in the same chest, in the same way as the love of your children.\n\nAnd this is where \"work-life balance\" comes from because it's not opposites that you're comparing; it's not you're looking at your children and thinking they're going to starve because you have to hustle to bring home the bacon.\n\nIt's, \"I will die if I don't feed my inspiration.\n\nThis is how meaning comes into my life, how I can smile honestly, and how I can show my child what it means to be human, right?\n\nAnd I need to make time for my family.\"\n\nAnd that light, they're both light.\n\nYou can hold this in your heart at the same time.\n\nI don't think you can hold your baby and stress about your boss firing you at the same time in the same kind of way.\n\nThey're different.\n\nSo, I think there's an essential financial element that we need to incorporate into our programs to relieve stress, increase duration, and really change everything.\n\nThis is the transforming nature that needs to happen.\n\nPeople are talking about new forms of work and trying to integrate more education into classrooms.\n\nAnd I really wonder if we look.\n\nThere are certainly some people that can change, right?\n\nThere are certainly people who have an innate inclination toward something in their childhood, but they're not exposed to something different in their adult lives.\n\nIt might totally invigorate and inspire them, and then they might just fall down, like, \"Oh my God, I should have been a Tibetan Buddhist, and I'm going to move to Tibet and become a follower of the Dalai Lama, and that's it.\"\n\nI met people, literally people that are like that, and her name is, it doesn't matter, she's excellent.\n\nAnd it might be a complete surprise.\n\nAnd so that is one of the questions.\n\nThe other thing about first principles is that when we talk about the foundation of things, we also need to get the first principles of things.\n\nAnd so, some of my first principles are that humans are good.\n\nThere's goodness that wants to come through humans.\n\nAnd this partially comes from two things.\n\nOne is rational, and the other is emotional, spiritual belief.\n\nThe rational one is if I didn't believe that most people don't have a potential psychological problem, mental disability, or tumor in their brain that suppresses their compassion, most people are fundamental; they have goodness that wants to flow through them.\n\nAnd if that weren't true, if that wasn't true, I would kill myself.\n\nThis is in the reductionist, \"I don't believe in God\" world, okay?\n\nBecause I wouldn't want to be in a world like that, where I had to look over my back and not trust anybody and think that everyone's a potential sociopath. It would be exhausting and complicated, and not actually the experience I have.\n\nThe reality is that if people aren't traumatized, hurt, or suffering, most of them want to be friendly, kind, and generous, and a few might, no matter what happens, have these negative traits.\n\nAlso, most people aren't living in a peaceful world where everything's okay.\n\nPeople are hurt by their families; they're hurt by society, and they're hurt by many things that create contortions that cause people to behave in ways against themselves.\n\nBut like I said at the beginning of this giant monologue, there's a good part of us that wants to come forth.\n\nSo that's like one of the foundational beliefs.\n\nAnother foundational belief, which I don't know, is that it's better to go up into the system of transformation and generation than into the systems of creation and concretization of measurement.\n\nIt's better to measure human interaction and the uncertainty of conversation that will manifest in the now and in the present and to reduce the investment in measuring the past, the done deal, and the money in the bank, especially because that's all dead.\n\nThis is a life.\n\nAnd sure, money in the bank is essential, but what if we started measuring the other thing?\n\nI think we would change capitalism in a way.\n\nWe would actually talk more about it, like, imagine if the measurement was family conversations over dinner.\n\nDinner would have to be there, right?\n\nSo the farmer has the farm and all that.\n\nBut if the farmer is stressing out and overexerting and trying to get the combine, and it's working all day and all night, and then it's getting robots, whatever, and then the farmer doesn't have a job anymore, so he's on the streets, and he's begging, then we're not having quality family conversations over dinner.\n\nAnd another important element here is quality.\n\nHow are we going to measure that?\n\nAre we going to use an A.I.?\n\nIs this a good conversation?\n\nOr are we going to ask people how they feel?\n\nWhat was meaningful about it?\n\nThis will be able to expose the values.\n\nAnd then, if these are the things that we measure, these are the types of businesses that are approaching those measurements, which are going to be the ones that are meaningful for everybody.\n\nAnd then it's like holding those two lights in your chest.\n\nIt's not my children or my inspiration.\n\nIt's not me winning in my business or you winning in yours.\n\nIt's like some values are essential, like the fundamental need for a shared humanity where people are respected, able to pursue meaning, and have lived with the fundamental human rights of food and water and all of this stuff, right?\n\nIf that is the baseline and we measure our business accordingly by finding the things that we find most meaningful, that's your why.\n\nThis is why, actually, here, this is an exciting part.\n\nThis is how we can transform the start with why.\n\nWe need to start asking people for meaningful moments and do Joe Edelman's process of values articulation.\n\nWhen they can articulate their values, they speak both their why and potentially the thing that they want to measure and see happen, or at least as a proxy for it.\n\nSo, for instance, let me think about it, and you start with emotions, which are values articulated by finding an emotion.\n\nAnd so, yeah, for me, oh my goodness, well, a lot of my emotions these days are about faith and trust and commitments to a spiritual tradition because I struggled a lot with that in my younger years.\n\nAnd, you know, the right way to do it would be to go deep into the story, but I'm already an hour and a half into this conversation.\n\nSo, I have found myself committing and walking a path based on an inner sight and knowing that it is real and as real as seeing with my eyes because there's trial and confirmation, you know, like you see with your eyes. Something looks like a step, and you can step on it, and it'll hold you up, and it's great.\n\nIt's real, you've confirmed.\n\nSimilarly, I see something that looks like a step with my heart.\n\nIt says there are promises, for instance, in the tradition that you will not give charity and will be impoverished.\n\nSo, you step on that step with faith and confidence and see if it holds you up.\n\nAnd, alhamdulillah, as I have had in the last weeks and months, there is more and more confirmation that there's a glass bridge.\n\nAnd I realize, for me, this glass bridge is real, and it elevates people.\n\nQuite like in my imagination, you see these people, and they are of good character, and they're flying high, and they're in the sky, and they yell down, and they say, I'm not flying, it's a glass bridge.\n\nI'm just walking on a glass bridge, bro.\n\nAnd then, you're at the edge of this thing and can't see it, but you stub it with your toe, and you're like, oh shoot, there's something here.\n\nWhat the heck is this?\n\nYou follow your inspiration, try to see with the eye of your heart, and start walking with trepidation.\n\nImagine you can't see anything at all, and it looks like you're in the sky, stepping one foot after another.\n\nAt any moment, you lose faith and feel like you can fall down a thousand feet, but you're walking, and the more you walk, the more confidence you gain in the reality of this unseen thing that people think you're crazy about.\n\nBut it's just glass. It's just transparent.\n\nAnd it's like, you know, you know how some things are transparent to different wavelengths but opaque to others?\n\nIt's transparent to the eyes in your head that are all thinking, but it's real and solid to the eye of the heart.\n\nAnd it will allow you to do things that will make me, allow me to do things that make me proud of myself and go through difficulty gracefully and understand things differently and cause that understanding to become a kind of a unique life that is, for me, really beautiful.\n\nAnd I think the thing—again, I'm just going to come back to it—is this idea of surprise.\n\nAnd awe and humility and all of that, and how it connects to this moment of amazement and being like, \"Oh my God, is the soul real?\n\nAre we not just meat machines?\n\nOh my God, this is real.\n\nI'm on this bridge.\n\nI think I believe this.\"\n\nAnd so, for me, realizing that I believe this and that so much of my inspiration also comes from the Muslim tradition.\n\nAs you can see in our old table, there's like the 99 names of God.\n\nI was trying to align them to the via because I really believe in these values, articulation, parallelism, and creation, and that the one God revealed only one religion to the whole world to align them with their most natural state.\n\nAnd it's just us who can get confused and get lost.\n\nAnd because we're overly complicated brains, we think, you know, to be safe, I need to hoard money or to be safe, I need to push other people down.\n\nAnd it's fear and the confusion that creates all of this stuff.\n\nAnd when you live according to your values, trust, vision, beauty, and wonder, first of all, it's true that you might die.\n\nPeople in Al-Qaza, they believe, and they die.\nThe question is:\nAre we here to save the world or are we here to be saved by the world?\nAnd you see the people of “Gaza” lose everything but they win purity of heart.\n\nBut you see also, they die with dignity, and they die happy, and they die consented with God.\n\nAngry with the people killing them, of course, but I do not see, and I have not heard so many people talking to their dead children, asking them to send their regards to the Prophet.\n\nThat's surprising.\n\nAnd that's beautiful, and that's amazing.\n\nAnd I think that when I start really realizing, \"Whoa, this is crazy.\n\nI can't believe; I believe in God.\"\n\nIt's about surprise, awe, wonder, and amazement and how that results in the frameworks, beauty, and way that we do our programs. I measure different things and values and how they're all connected to summarize this.\n\n\n\n"

Here's a summary of where we left off on the project to align learning in humans with learning in LLMs:\n\n1. **Framework for Learning**: You have been working on articulating the importance and the irrelevance of rigid frameworks for learning, emphasizing the need for adaptable frameworks that cater to 21st-century skills. The goal is to create a learning model that is flexible and can be adapted to various contexts and individual needs.\n\n2. **Metacognitive Capacity**: You consider the development of metacognitive capacity as crucial in your learning framework. This involves helping learners become aware of their own learning processes, enabling them to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning strategies effectively.\n\n3. **Theoretical Connections**: You are interested in connecting theoretical frameworks across fields to advance the idea of learning as a graph. This graph represents learning with options and flexibility, allowing for personalized and interconnected learning pathways.\n\n4. **Game-of-Life Approach**: You want to include concepts like the game-of-life approach, where learning goals are connected to motives and propulsive forces for learning.

By reframing 21st century skills as a \"21st century understanding\" and recognizing the education system's need to continually learn and evolve, it explores how to optimize learning for individual and collective meaning. The framework emphasizes supporting each learner's unique \"genius\" through a dynamic, graph-based learning process, balancing local and global context, and fostering virtues of humility, openness, and agility. It also examines the contextual fit of different leadership models and the role of technology in enabling learner-driven exploration and adaptation. The Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework offers strategies for implementation and identifies areas for further research to empower youth in shaping the future of education.\nIntroduction In an era of rapid change and increasing complexity, the need for a new educational paradigm has become increasingly evident. Traditional models of education, focused on the linear transmission of knowledge and skills, are proving inadequate in preparing learners to thrive in the 21st century. This article proposes a new framework called \"Cultivating Knowledge Gardens\" that reconceptualizes learning as a dynamic, adaptive process optimized for individual and collective meaning-making. By empowering youth to co-create their educational ecosystems, this approach aims to develop not only the skills but the understanding necessary for learners to navigate and shape an uncertain future. The article will explore the evolving landscape of 21st century education, the importance of supporting each learner's unique \"genius,\" the contextual fit of different leadership models, and the role of technology in enabling learner-driven exploration and adaptation. Through this analysis, it will articulate the core principles and strategies of the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework, as well as identify challenges and areas for further research in its implementation.\nThe Evolving Landscape of 21st Century Skills 2.1 From Skills to Understanding The concept of \"21st century skills\" has gained prominence as a way to identify the competencies needed for success in an increasingly complex and uncertain world. However, the rapid pace of change suggests that specific skills may become obsolete, requiring a shift towards a deeper \"21st century understanding.\" This understanding involves not only acquiring knowledge and skills but also developing the capacity to learn, adapt, and innovate in response to new challenges and opportunities.\n2.2 Redefining the Role of Educators and Learners In this evolving landscape, the roles of educators and learners must also be redefined. Rather than being mere transmitters of knowledge, educators become facilitators and guides, helping learners navigate the complex ecosystems of information and relationships in which they are embedded. Learners, in turn, take on greater agency and responsibility for their own learning, becoming active co-creators of their educational experiences. This shift requires a reexamination of traditional power dynamics and a move towards more collaborative, reciprocal forms of learning and leadership.\nOptimizing for Individual and Collective Meaning 3.1 Supporting Each Learner's Unique \"Genius\" At the heart of the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework is a recognition of the unique \"genius\" of each learner - the combination of talents, passions, and experiences that shape their identity and potential. By creating learning environments that allow learners to discover and develop their genius, this approach taps into intrinsic motivation and enables learners to find personal meaning and purpose in their education. This process involves providing learners with diverse pathways and opportunities for exploration, as well as the support and guidance needed to pursue their interests and overcome challenges.\n3.2 Balancing Local and Global Context Optimizing for meaning also requires balancing attention to both local and global contexts. Learners need opportunities to engage with and contribute to their immediate communities, developing a sense of place and purpose. At the same time, they must also develop an understanding of global issues and perspectives, cultivating the skills and dispositions needed for effective collaboration and problem-solving across cultural and geographic boundaries. The Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework seeks to create learning ecosystems that enable learners to navigate between these different scales of context, finding meaning in the connections and tensions between them.\n3.3 Humility, Openness, and Agility as Key Virtues Underlying the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens approach is a set of key virtues that enable learners to thrive in conditions of uncertainty and change. Chief among these is humility - a recognition of the limits of one's own knowledge and a willingness to learn from others. This humility is complemented by openness - a curiosity and receptivity to new ideas and experiences. Finally, agility involves the capacity to adapt and pivot in response to changing circumstances, while maintaining a sense of purpose and direction. By cultivating these virtues, learners develop the resilience and resourcefulness needed to navigate the complexities of the 21st century.\nLeadership and Its Contextual Fit 4.1 Decentralized vs. Hierarchical Models The Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework also requires a reexamination of traditional models of leadership in education. While hierarchical, centralized models of leadership have been dominant in many educational institutions, there is growing recognition of the need for more decentralized, distributed forms of leadership that empower learners and educators at all levels. However, the appropriate balance between centralization and decentralization may vary depending on the specific context and goals of a learning community.\n4.2 Case Studies: Successes and Failures The article explores several case studies of educational initiatives that have experimented with different leadership models, highlighting both successes and failures. For example, the author's experiences with consensus-based decision-making in a hackerspace in Michigan and a science camp in Iraq illustrate the challenges of implementing decentralized leadership in contexts where it may not be culturally or practically appropriate. These case studies underscore the importance of adapting leadership approaches to the unique needs and circumstances of each learning community.\nA Dynamic, Graph-Based Learning Process 5.1 Limitations of Linear Models Traditional educational models often rely on linear, sequential pathways that assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. However, these models fail to account for the diversity of learners' interests, abilities, and experiences. They also struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving landscape of knowledge and skills in the 21st century.\n5.2 Benefits of Learner-Driven Exploration and Adaptation In contrast, the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework proposes a dynamic, graph-based model of learning that enables learners to explore multiple pathways and adapt their learning journeys over time. In this model, learners navigate a complex ecosystem of knowledge and relationships, following their curiosity and building connections between different domains. They engage in a continuous process of discovery, reflection, and adaptation, using feedback and guidance from educators and peers to refine their goals and strategies.\n5.3 The Banyan Tree Analogy The banyan tree serves as a powerful analogy for this graph-based learning process. Like the banyan tree, which grows by sending out aerial roots that become new trunks, learners in the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework are encouraged to explore new directions and establish new bases for growth. They build on their existing knowledge and experiences, while also reaching out to connect with new people, ideas, and opportunities. Over time, this process leads to the development of a robust, interconnected ecosystem of learning that can sustain and nourish learners throughout their lives.\nThe Role of Technology 6.1 Adaptive Learning Systems Technology plays a crucial role in enabling the dynamic, adaptive learning processes envisioned by the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework. Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have made it possible to create adaptive learning systems that can personalize instruction and support based on learners' individual needs and preferences. These systems can analyze data on learners' performance and engagement, providing targeted feedback and recommendations for further exploration and skill development.\n6.2 Balancing Digital and Human Elements However, the use of technology in education must be balanced with attention to human elements such as relationships, emotions, and values. While adaptive learning systems can provide powerful tools for personalization and efficiency, they cannot replace the role of human educators in providing guidance, mentorship, and support. The Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework seeks to leverage the strengths of both digital and human elements, creating hybrid learning ecosystems that optimize for meaning and purpose.\nCultivating Knowledge Gardens 7.1 A New Framework for Meaningful Learning The Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework represents a new approach to education that prioritizes meaning, adaptation, and empowerment. By recognizing the unique genius of each learner and the importance of balancing local and global context, this framework seeks to create dynamic, collaborative learning ecosystems that can evolve and thrive in the face of uncertainty and change.\n7.2 Implementation Strategies and Challenges Implementing the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework will require significant shifts in educational policies, practices, and mindsets. It will involve redesigning learning spaces and curricula to support exploration and adaptation, as well as redefining the roles and relationships of educators and learners. It will also require investment in professional development and infrastructure to enable the effective use of technology and data in personalized learning.\nHowever, these challenges are not insurmountable. By engaging diverse stakeholders - including educators, learners, families, and communities - in collaborative design and decision-making processes, it is possible to create shared vision and ownership for the transformation of education. By piloting and iterating on new models and approaches, learning communities can test and refine strategies for cultivating knowledge gardens in their unique contexts.\nConclusion The Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework offers a transformative vision for 21st century education, one that empowers youth to co-create meaningful, adaptive learning ecosystems. By reframing the goals and processes of education around the cultivation of individual and collective meaning, this approach recognizes the unique \"genius\" of each learner and the importance of balancing local and global context. It calls for a shift from linear, hierarchical models of education to a dynamic, graph-based process of exploration and adaptation, enabled by advances in technology but grounded in the development of key human virtues such as humility, openness, and agility.\nWhile the implementation of this framework presents significant challenges, from redesigning educational structures to redefining the roles of educators and learners, it also offers tremendous opportunities for unlocking the potential of youth to shape a more vibrant, equitable, and sustainable future. Further research and experimentation will be essential to refining the principles and practices of the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens approach, but its core vision – of empowering learners to cultivate their own knowledge gardens in service of individual and collective flourishing – represents a vital direction for the future of education in the 21st century.\n\nAI Summary:\nTitle: Cultivating Knowledge Gardens: A New Framework for Meaningful, Adaptive Learning Subtitle: Empowering Youth to Co-Create Educational Ecosystems for the 21st Century\nTable of Contents:\nIntroduction\nThe Evolving Landscape of 21st Century Skills 2.1 From Skills to Understanding 2.2 Redefining the Role of Educators and Learners\nOptimizing for Individual and Collective Meaning 3.1 Supporting Each Learner's Unique \"Genius\" 3.2 Balancing Local and Global Context 3.3 Humility, Openness, and Agility as Key Virtues\nLeadership and Its Contextual Fit 4.1 Decentralized vs. Hierarchical Models 4.2 Case Studies: Successes and Failures\nA Dynamic, Graph-Based Learning Process 5.1 Limitations of Linear Models 5.2 Benefits of Learner-Driven Exploration and Adaptation 5.3 The Banyan Tree Analogy\nThe Role of Technology 6.1 Adaptive Learning Systems 6.2 Balancing Digital and Human Elements\nCultivating Knowledge Gardens 7.1 A New Framework for Meaningful Learning 7.2 Implementation Strategies and Challenges\nConclusion\n\nAbstract: This article proposes a new educational framework called \"Cultivating Knowledge Gardens\" that aims to make learning more meaningful, adaptive, and empowering for youth in the 21st century.

Use a circular diagram to represent the continuous cycle of knowledge transfer and growth.\n\n#### Chart 2:\n\n**Name**: *RLHF in LLM Training: Aligning Operations with Human Educational Goals*\n**Description**: This chart explains the role of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in shaping LLM operations to better support human learning and development. It's interesting because it delves into the training phase of LLMs and how it can be optimized for educational purposes.\n\n**Improvement**: Highlight how RLHF can be used to align LLM behaviors with goals of fostering human creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Use a flowchart to show the stages of RLHF and its impact on LLM outputs.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 4:\n\n**Title**: *Motivational Drivers in Human and LLM Learning: A Comparative Analysis*\n**Subtitle**: *Harnessing Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors for Enhanced Learning Outcomes*\n\n#### Chart 1:\n\n**Name**: *Comparing Motivational Drivers: Human vs. LLM Learning*\n**Description**: This chart identifies and compares the motivational drivers in human learning and LLM training, emphasizing how intrinsic and extrinsic motivations can be harnessed in both contexts. It's novel because it bridges the gap between human psychology and artificial intelligence in a meaningful way.\n\n**Improvement**: Introduce elements of the \"Adaptive Learning Compass\" to show how motivations are not static but evolve based on learners' goals and contexts. Include a visual metaphor, like a compass, guiding learners through changing landscapes of motivation and opportunity.\n\n#### Chart 2:\n\n**Name**: *Zone of Genius: Mapping Human Strengths and LLM Capabilities*\n**Description**: This chart maps the zones of genius in humans and capabilities in LLMs, showing how leveraging strengths can lead to optimal learning outcomes. It's interesting because it provides a framework for aligning individual strengths with learning tasks in both humans and machines.\n\n**Improvement**: Highlight the dynamic interplay between human strengths and LLM capabilities, showing how each can adapt and respond to new challenges. Use a visual representation that evolves, like a tree with branches growing in new directions, symbolizing continuous growth and adaptation.\n\n---\n\nThese revisions should provide a clearer structure for each paper, reducing overlap and emphasizing distinct yet interconnected themes. The concept of \"air gapping\" LLMs and the importance of RLHF in aligning LLM operations with human educational goals are integrated to highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in supporting human growth and learning.\n"

      "content": " Humility emerges as the core concept for learning in relation to becoming and Large Language Models (LLMs) for several compelling reasons:\n\n1. Recognizing the limits of knowledge: Humility involves acknowledging that our knowledge and understanding are always incomplete and subject to change. In the context of learning and personal growth, humility allows us to remain open to new ideas, perspectives, and experiences. Similarly, while LLMs possess vast knowledge, they should be designed and used with the understanding that their knowledge is not perfect or exhaustive.\n\n2. Openness to feedback and improvement: A humble learner is receptive to feedback, seeing it as an opportunity for growth rather than a threat to their ego. This mindset is crucial for continuous learning and development. In the case of LLMs, humility can be embodied through the process of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), where the models learn and improve based on human input and guidance.\n\n3. Collaboration and learning from others: Humility fosters an appreciation for the knowledge and skills of others, recognizing that learning is often a collaborative process. In the context of LLMs, humility can be reflected in the design of models that aim to augment and support human learning rather than replace human intelligence. By positioning LLMs as tools for collaboration and inspiration, we encourage users to actively engage in the learning process.\n\n4. Adaptability in the face of change: Humility enables learners to adapt to new situations and challenges, as they are less likely to be hindered by fixed mindsets or rigid beliefs. In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and LLMs, humility is essential for both developers and users to navigate the uncertainties and embrace the potential for growth and innovation.\n\n5. Ethical and responsible use of technology: Humility reminds us to consider the limitations and potential risks associated with powerful technologies like LLMs. By approaching these tools with humility, we are more likely to use them responsibly, acknowledging their potential biases and imperfections. This mindset promotes the development of LLMs that prioritize human agency, empowerment, and well-being.\n\nIn the context of becoming, humility is essential for personal growth and transformation. It allows individuals to embrace the ongoing process of learning, self-discovery, and adaptation. By recognizing that our identities and capabilities are not fixed, but rather continuously evolving, we open ourselves up to new possibilities and experiences.\n\nSimilarly, when developing and utilizing LLMs, humility should be a guiding principle. By designing these models to support and augment human learning, rather than replace human effort, we create opportunities for individuals to actively engage in the learning process. LLMs can serve as powerful tools for inspiration, feedback, and collaboration, but their role should be one of empowerment rather than automation.\n\nUltimately, by embracing humility as a core concept in both human learning and the development of LLMs, we foster a culture of continuous growth, adaptability, and responsible innovation. This approach not only enhances the potential for individual transformation but also promotes the ethical and effective integration of AI technologies into our learning processes.",

The concept note of Digital Learning Week 2024 is available online for your reference. This annual event has been recognized as one of the “UN Intergovernmental and Multi-Stakeholder Digital Cooperation Bodies and Forums” to convene the community of digital education leaders, policy-makers, researchers and practitioners from various organizations, including UN agencies, governments, NGOs and the private sector.\n\nDigital Learning Week 2024 aims to promote multi-stakeholder cooperation towards a human-centred and climate-friendly design and use of AI in education, with a specific focus on exploring the interlinkages between digital transformation and greening education.\n\nTo surface best practices and facilitate knowledge sharing, UNESCO is opening a call for proposals of presentations during Digital Learning Week 2024. Selected presenters will have the unique opportunity to address a global audience comprising policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, private sector partners and development agencies.\n\nPlease note that UNESCO mainly seeks proposals pertaining to practices that have been implemented at scale, which means that conceptual ideas without practical implementation are not preferable.\n\nThe form below requests a narrative description of your presentations while personal information such as email addresses will not be shared. If your presentation is selected for inclusion in the programme, the description you provide will be used directly on the UNESCO website and other communication materials. Please allow yourself sufficient time to complete the required fields and ensure clarity and readability of text. Only proposals in English or French will be considered.\n\nPresentation proposals must be submitted to UNESCO no later than 31 May 2024. Selected proposals will be notified by 28 June 2024.\n\nPlease note that only selected submissions will be notified via email.\n\nEach participant will be responsible for their own travel and accommodations to Digital Learning Week.\n\n\nI want to focus on\n1.1 National or institutional AI competency frameworks or standards for students\n3.1 Strategies developed and implemented for addressing challenges that AI, especially generative AI, poses to academic integrity and learning assessment\n2.3 Design and implementation of innovative methodologies for training and/or assessing teachers’ AI competency development\nTraining programmes implemented and/or guidelines tested to support teaching and research staff to develop AI competencies and make ethical use of AI\n\n\nwhat is a way of reformulating what I'm saying so that it's applicable here? \n\nyou can use the previous content, anything in any of our previous conversations and this content here:\n𝐇𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐭 𝐰𝐞𝐢𝐫𝐝 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐈 𝐭𝐨 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐫 𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐚𝐧 𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐥? \nThat's a clue as to why AI won't replace us and why we need to work on a new trajectory to leverage AI for our own growth and competence. \n𝘐 𝘣𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘦𝘷𝘦 𝘈𝘐 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘈𝘐 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘧𝘶𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬... 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬 𝘪𝘵 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘣𝘦. \n\n💡 𝐖𝐚𝐲𝐰𝐚𝐲.𝐀𝐈 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐦𝐲 𝐋𝐋𝐌 𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞 hashtag#𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐭𝐬𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐞𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞, 𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐞, 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐬.\nThere's a story about Picasso that I love. He once drew someone in 30 seconds and tried to sell the drawing for a high price. When questioned about it, he said, \"It took me my entire life to make it.\" \n\nThis story inspires my questions about work, effort, and value. The problem isn't that the machines wrote the blog post quickly; the issue is it includes nothing of 𝘺𝘰𝘶 in it. So my question is: what is \"you,\" and how can it be brought into the work we build together with AI?\n\n💬 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐰𝐞 𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐀𝐈 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐮𝐬 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐝?\nThis got me thinking about generative AI tools for images, like MidJourney, which creates images on a pixel level, not a brush level, not a camera lens level; it's a 16-bit unit without meaning. A letter makes a sound, a sound has meaning - a pixel is arbitrary. \n\nThis is the difference between image and text generation; the fundamental unit differs. Large Language Models like chatGPT seem to follow biomimetic principles, thus mapping to human cognition more closely and allowing a mutual exchange of intelligence—not so with the black box of midjourney.\n\n𝘏𝘰𝘸 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘪𝘵 𝘣𝘦 𝘥𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴? \nI think it has to be taken down to the atomic element, the pen stroke (pressure, angle, speed, smoothness...) and drawing styles.\n\n🖌 𝐀𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭'𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐰𝐚𝐲.𝐀𝐈 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧. \nI've been building it to explore whether we can create artificial craftsmanship.

      "content": " Here is a draft proposal for a presentation at the UNESCO Digital Learning Week 2024 that incorporates the ideas and content you provided:\n\nTitle: Cultivating Artificial Craftsmanship: A Framework for Human-AI Collaboration in Education\n\nDescription: \nAs AI, especially generative AI, rapidly advances and permeates the education landscape, it is crucial that we develop strategies and competency frameworks to harness its potential in a human-centered, ethical way. Rather than fearing AI will replace human effort and creativity, we must explore how it can enhance and augment our capabilities through thoughtful collaboration.\n\nThis presentation will introduce an innovative framework called \"Artificial Craftsmanship\" that aims to facilitate meaningful, symbiotic partnerships between educators, learners, and AI systems. Drawing upon insights from cognitive science, educational psychology, and AI ethics, the framework outlines key principles and methodologies for designing AI-enhanced learning experiences that prioritize human agency, growth, and the unique \"imprint\" of each individual.\n\nKey elements of the Artificial Craftsmanship framework include:\n\n1. Defining AI competencies and ethical standards for educators and learners that emphasize discernment, critical thinking, and responsible use rather than blind reliance on AI outputs. \n\n2. Developing pedagogical strategies and tools that leverage AI's capabilities to provide inspiration, feedback and knowledge extension while requiring active human engagement and original contribution. The goal is for humans and AI to evolve and learn together.\n\n3. Establishing methods to capture and encode the subtle, often unconscious elements of an educator's or learner's unique style, perspective and creative process. This \"human imprint\" is then integrated into the AI collaboration, resulting in outputs that reflect individual identity and agency.\n\n4. Implementing assessment approaches that evaluate the quality of human-AI collaboration and knowledge artifacts based on criteria such as originality, criticality, and ethical reasoning, rather than just efficiency or surface-level performance.\n\nThe presentation will feature concrete examples and case studies of the Artificial Craftsmanship framework being applied in various educational contexts, from K-12 classrooms to university courses. Empirical data on learning outcomes, engagement levels, and creative self-efficacy will be shared.\n\nAttendees will gain practical insights and strategies for designing AI-enhanced educational experiences that empower educators and learners to become \"artificial craftsmen\" - harnessing the power of AI as a tool for augmenting and expressing their unique human capabilities. The framework's emphasis on human agency, growth and identity offers a promising path forward for education in an AI-driven world.\n\nBy facilitating dialogue and knowledge-sharing around human-centered approaches to educational AI, this presentation aims to contribute to UNESCO's mission of promoting ethical, inclusive and transformative digital learning on a global scale. It will equip education stakeholders with conceptual foundations and practical techniques to proactively shape the future of educational AI as a force for human flourishing.",

            "extracted_content": "The concept of using LLMs to enable \"dark talent\" - identifying and empowering extremely talented individuals from marginalized backgrounds anywhere in the world. The author argues LLMs could help level the playing field in terms of access to knowledge and opportunities.\nThe idea that human intelligence and machine intelligence have deep similarities in how they process information through analogies, abstraction and concept clustering. The author proposes that by exposing humans to how machines learn, we can transfer some machine learning advancements to marginalized human learners.\nThe philosophical argument that beauty and elegance are reliable guides to truth and meaning, as seen in fields like mathematics and science. The DNA structure example illustrates how the correct answer was also the most beautiful one.\nThe notion of \"mental complexity\" levels and how machines are increasingly able to handle the \"how\" of tasks while humans must focus on the higher-level \"why\". The author argues education should focus on developing this higher wisdom and sense of purpose.\nThe overall thesis that in the age of AI, the role of humans is to access our \"zone of genius\" - the intersection of all our knowledge plus an element of inspired, indescribable intuition about meaning, purpose and beauty. Education should aim to develop this capacity.\n\nThe document presents a thought-provoking vision for the future of human learning and flourishing in an AI-driven world. The ideas around machine-human knowledge transfer and re-envisioning education around wisdom and beauty are particularly intriguing and novel. The philosophical elements woven throughout add depth to the author's perspective.

The document emphasizes the critical role of inner work, self-reflection, and cultivation of enduring positive states in authentic change.\n\n\nFocusing on meaningful, value-driven entrepreneurship rather than just scale:\n\n\nConnects to the notion that actions should align with one's deepest values and aspirations. The author argues entrepreneurship should be about pursuing a meaningful \"why\" that resonates with one's authentic self, not just chasing money or impressive scale.\n\n\nAppreciating the beauty and potential in each individual:\n\n\nTies into the foundational belief that humans are fundamentally good and possess a \"divine spark\". The document advocates trusting in people's innate goodness and unique potential, which educators should help them unlock.\n\n\nCultivating a sense of awe, wonder, humility and faith:\n\n\nRelates to embracing uncertainty and a higher power/intelligence. The author shares their spiritual journey of developing faith and humility by being open to surprise, amazement and truths beyond the material world.\n\n\nRedefining success metrics to prioritize transformation and meaning:\n\n\nChallenges the reductive quantification of entrepreneurship programs' impact. Instead, the document proposes focusing on meaningful human interactions, inspiration, and personal transformation as key success indicators.\n\nIn summary, the document builds upon the earlier ideas by advocating for a more holistic, personal growth-oriented and values-driven approach to entrepreneurship education - one that recognizes the fundamental goodness in people, inspires awe and humility, and redefines success in more meaningful terms beyond pure scale or financial outcomes. The common thread is inner transformation as the foundation for positive external impact.\n\ninclude some of this information \nSteps to Produce the Thematic Analysis Framework\nFamiliarization with

document and how do they relate to our framework work?\n\n\nINSPIRE & NAVIGATE\nAligned Pedagogically Sound Frameworks\n  For Transformational Learning\n\nIntroduction - How to Learn What You Don’t Know Without A Teacher\nLearning how to learn is the fundamental skill of learning. It implies we must know about ourselves, our abilities, and our limits and understand the knowledge landscape. It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers, instead of approaching them to produce answers themselves, aided by the tool.  To use LLMs effectively we must understand them deeply, understand learning deeply, and to map between learning needs and the architecture and mechanics LLMs have that open up different affordances. \n\nIntuitively we can do this through a simplified geometric representation of a goal and a knowledge map and some intuitive leaps. We are approaching this practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nWe believe it may be possible to have  a one to one map for the production of data points, which leads to information, which is then refined into knowledge both within the human mind as a learner, as well as within leverageable structures within LLMs. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination. \n\n\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nSince last December after hundreds of hours of GPT use the following framework has been developed. Finding first the principles that led to better results with Large Language Models (LLMs) and then later formalized through the lense of cognitive science, adult development theories and research into transformative pedagogies for learning. The guiding question has always been to identify the leverage offered by the fundamentals of how LLMs work - embeddings and concept clusters and transformer attention mechanisms, and to identify the opportunity space made by these two new vectors for learning. Of particular interest to the author is how LLMs may offer individuals pushed to the margins due to migration, economic impoverishment, being born in the wrong country, or otherwise - and how they may be able to identify the limits of their understanding in contrast to others who’ve been given every advantage to explore, to experience, to be mentored and through this to develop a vision, build understanding and capacity and finally to be able to act upon their dreams\nBalaji Srinivasan, author of the Network State, describes “dark talent” - the idea that through networking we can find extreme talant anywhere then support and network them into a powerful State beyond borders. This idea superficially sounds possible, yet upon further consideration good ideas do not come simply from numbers of brains alone. Exposure is critical. While there are many definitions for intelligence, the one that appeals to me most is the one proposed by Douglass Hofsteader in his book Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire as the ability to abstract and generalize from specific instances into concepts that become manipulable in an uninterpreted way. For instance the moment you hear something it’s either a noise or a sound, a sound you can say has an isness - an implication, hooked into an idea, a noise is something that must be interpreted. That immediate translation from auditory input into categorization likely develops like our other senses, and it’s for this reason I propose we may be more likely homo-sensorious than homo-sapiens, since thinking is seeing. The process of taking sensory input, conceptual input and deriving a new “one of those” is a process humanity does individually and collectively. Youth are often at the forefront, as GenZ slang demonstrates copious examples. \nLet’s talk about being “Based” - which originated as a way to describe someone who was “freebasing” drugs, which itself is a created concept based on the idea of acids and bases, transforming amines, usually basic, into their neutral counterparts to alter their consumption methods and impacts. Now, for GenZ, being based simply means “not caring” - and it’s very likely the majority of people using the word have no understanding of the chemical processes underpinning the origin of the word. And most chemists likely do not know that the word, base, comes from the greek pedestal due to it bening the structure upon which an acid rests upon when making a salt (The Origin of the Term “Base” by William B. Jense 10.1021/ed083p1130). \n\nWhy did we take this long detour into understanding the origins of ideas? It’s to make it clear that there is more than superficial language connecting human intelligence with machine intelligence, and that by exposing how a machine learns to a human, we can transfer some of the millions of dollars and effort spent running millions of words across the attention mechanisms of LLMs to the most marginalized learners on the planet. Making it more likely that they could be one of the “dark talents” that will come up with the idea that will deeply and positively impact their communities and our world. The network state should seek true diversity for it to make true on its promise, otherwise we will have a silicon valley state with Berlin, Beijing, Paris, Silicon Valley, New York, Porto, Dubai, Bangalore and other cities like these being over-represented, and not due to their population count. \nTo increase the possible surface area of ideas crossing minds that are able to merge and encompass I believe we need to create structures to support what is already common in transformational learning to be the foundational elements of pre-training and fine tuning of our LLMs and then to make them universally available on smartphones, it’s estimated that by the end of 2024 7.1 billion people will have a smart phone totaling nearly 88 percent of the human population(including infants).\nWhile we’re waiting for openAI and Anthropic to integrate machine-human transfer learning into the core of their offering, we have options:\nSupport the development of the ways of being that inspire prompting along the framework described below. \nTechnological supports: Build grammarly-like plugins that highlight non-optimal uses of LLMs and offer suggestions of improvements to increase machine to human intelligence transfer. \nDeveloping customized system prompts that align with the person that will maneuver the LLM to being more transfer and transformational in its dialog. \n\nThese two ideas:\nTransfer and transformation hint at what I believe to be the key insight underneath much of this argument, that we can learn best when we learn in symbiosis with a machine that learns in similar ways (concept clustering). \nSalience is the sense that things are meaningful and make sense, when you write a poem referring to your infant child as the light of your life, she doesn’t become photons, yet you may sense the rightness of this analogy. When taking certain entheogens one might start reducing their critical thinking allowing them to make analogies that are further off from reality. This lamppost reminds me of my highschool history teacher’s handwriting - perhaps. Yet how helpful is it for them, let alone others? Only God(swt) has the highest analogy, truely being able to see the oneness of everything - to hold that in total comprehension. We are reduced to analogies that are “useful” - yet the true geniuses are those that continue to expand and encompass till they are able to hold more things in the light of oneness. This is the process of meta-cognition. The ability to dive into the uniqueness yet zoom out into the unity at will. This in/out process is what enables the building of patterns across truely related concepts that those inside the concept space might not be able to see. \nThis is how pattern recognition is possible. A developer at a certain level of mental complexity may think their job is to provide code that achieves a goal - contrast this to a CEO making a decision where they may need to be able to see the interrelationships between being a father, a ceo, the company in the context of the economy, the economy in the context of global cultural shifts against capitalism, the international climate and how it relates to a decision between stainless steel and aluminum.\nThis level of thinking is more related to a why than a how. \nMachines are more and more able to take over the how, and normally mental complexity and human transformation that leads to it arises after many years of “one of those”ing many situations, building experience throughout life. Is it possible to develop and transform and grow in the true sorts of comprehension that allow someone to see and know the why behind things, the thing that touches the indeterminate gut intuition, the sense of rightness, the value that one knows through their emotions, the feeling of beauty that arises when the right thing emerges. \nThis is a “zone of genius” - this is everything one knows and an element of the ineffable, what exactly is a beautiful idea? How does one make a decision at high levels of abstraction? I believe that it’s similar to the physicist who chooses the more beautiful equation and finds this “trust” is rewarded. Or as G Hardy says: “The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.” Why?\nWhile one may dive into controversial territory speaking of God or Truth. I believe we can stay within the realm of the philosophical and logical. We see that salience is possible to artificially enhance, that moment when someone on a psychoactive substance senses they just found the meaning of everything and they write it down only later to find it’s something like “the stars are beautiful, and I am a star” or some other phrase that doesn’t quite pack the same punch. This is related to the difference between a two dimensional matrix True and false and permanent and transitory. There are moments in our lives when we are able to go a level above our mental complexity and we glimpse the world from above, like a flatlander in 2 dimensions being pulled into the third dimension and can finally understand the topology of 2 dimensional shapes, that all the differences he sees in triangles and squares and octogons, that really, in a sense that is hard to build when you live in 2, they’re all the same, a single line encompassing a space - all essentially circles. \nTo gain an intuitive understanding of the sort of space of inspiration needed to build new knowledge, let’s study this picture carefully:\nWhat does it look like it represents? \nImagine you produced this image through this process:\n\nTry to determine the structure of the material in the place of the green shape in the image above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Would you have guessed a corkscrew?\n\nWe now know what DNA looks like, I can only imagine the AHA moment Rosalind Franklin had when she made the connection between all the data. I also wonder if she also decided to use the frame of a twisted strand because it was beautiful. If only she was alive today to ask.\n\nThis realization that we find throught science and mathematics, that beauty is a trustworthy guide may have evolutionary origins, although there is no reason that of all the ways the world could have worked that it should be this way.\n\nI believe that a good human life is connected to this source of knowledge, the source where we know beauty and align ourselves and our actions with it. It’s not to become a bootcamp developer or whatever is the current trend in education. The how will be automated, craft remains since craft remains tied to purpose and beauty.\n\n2/2\n\n\nChatGPT\nUnique and Novel Insights in the Document\nHuman-LLM Symbiosis and Air Gapping:\n\nInsight: The concept of \"air gapping\" ensures that LLMs inspire human effort rather than replace it.
