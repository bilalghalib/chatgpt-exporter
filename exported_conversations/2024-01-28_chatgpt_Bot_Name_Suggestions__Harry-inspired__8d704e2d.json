Some places to draw inspiration that I can think of are names of tools that scholars used that also work as a person's name, the names of scholar helpers or assistants, the name of locations or schools. If you can think of really good names that are more modern, that'd be OK too, we don't have to restrict ourselves to the golden age of the middle east. Don't translate the words to English, keeping them in their original arabic language would be cool (I can read and speak arabic).\n\nHere's an example of a bot name that we used in the past for a similar, but different, community: \"Tahseen\" (تحسين), which is a person's name and it means improvement. People loved that name and they started addressing the bot as if it were a person. Everybody loved Tahseen.",

Here are some modified versions of the names:\n\n1. Noori (نوري): This variation of \"Noor\" maintains the essence of light and enlightenment while differentiating it from a person's name.\n\n2. Hadir (هادر): A variation of \"Hadi,\" which still implies guidance and leadership in learning but adds a distinct touch.\n\n3. Bilalat (بلالات): A modified version of \"Bilal\" that maintains the melodious aspect while making it unique.\n\n4. Samirah (سميرة): A variation of \"Sami\" with a feminine touch, if you want to differentiate it further.\n\n5. Tariqah (طارقة): A variation of \"Tariq\" that retains the idea of the morning star leading the way while making it distinct.\n\n6. Rashida (رشيدة): A feminine variation of \"Rashid\" that retains the wisdom and guidance aspect.\n\nThese slight modifications should help distinguish the bot's name from a real person with the same name while still preserving their meaningful and appealing qualities.",
