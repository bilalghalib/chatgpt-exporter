Let me search for specific information about the Maliki opinion on wiping over leather socks (khuffs) with small cracks.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nLet me search for more specific information about cracks in khuffs according to the Maliki school:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nBased on my research, I can now provide the Maliki position on wiping khuffs (leather socks) with small cracks:\n\nAccording to the Maliki school, the permissibility of wiping over khuffs with cracks or holes depends on the size and location of the damage:\n\nIf the rips or tears amount to less than a third the length of the foot, then wiping over the khuff is valid, except when the rips have completely opened up to reveal the foot beneath. This means that if your small crack is less than one-third the length of your foot, and it doesn't completely expose your foot, you can still wipe over the khuffs.\n\nAdditionally, small holes that do not transfer water to the interior of the socks when wiped with wet hands are considered harmless according to the Maliki position.\n\nRegarding your specific situation with a tiny crack on the bottom that light gets through: According to the Malikis, there is no specific limit for holes. As long as it is still called khuffs, one can wear them and wipe over them while performing wudu.\n\nThe evidence for the permissibility of wiping over khuffs in general comes from numerous hadiths. Al-Hasan reported that seventy Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) confirmed that he used to wipe over his khuffs with wet hands during ablution.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the Maliki position, if:\n1. Your leather socks still qualify as khuffs\n2. The crack is small (less than one-third the length of your foot)\n3. The crack doesn't completely expose your foot\n4. The crack doesn't allow water to transfer through when wiping\n\nThen you can still wipe over them for wudu. The tiny crack that merely allows light through appears to be well within the acceptable limits according to the Maliki madhab.",

Is there a time limit on how long a person can wear his khuffs and wipe over them instead of washing his feet? The ruling on wiping over khuffs, whilst performing one’s wudu’, instead of fully washing the feet, is that it is a dispensation (rukhsa), which is permitted by the Shari’a (as opposed to a dispensation which is recommended or sunna, such as shortening the prayer while travelling). It is not a condition that the person wearing them is travelling, he may wipe over them regardless of whether he is at home or travelling, even if his journey is of a forbidden type (such as setting out to rob people). As for jawrabs, it is only permitted to wipe over them if they are covered on the outside by leather (NOTE: So basically what is meant by a jawrab is a khuff whose inside is cotton or wool to make it more comfortable).\n\nThere is no time limit to how long a person can continue to wear his khuffs and so there is no time limit to how long he can continue to substitute wiping over them for washing his feet in wudu’ – he may do so for a year if he so wishes. If he removes them in that period, however, he must perform a full wudu‘, in which he washes his feet, before he is permitted to wipe over them again. (NOTE: The reason the issue of the time limit is mentioned is because, in some of the madhhabs, it is not permissible for a person to wear khuffs for longer than a day (or three days if the person wearing them is travelling) [ME: for example in the Hanafi Madhhab], after which he has to perform a full wudu’, in which he washes his feet, before he is permitted to wipe over them again). What are the preconditions for wiping over the khuff and jawrab? There are eleven preconditions which must be met before a person is permitted to wipe over his socks in wudu’; six preconditions relating to that which is wip",

The khuffs must cover all the part of one’s legs that must be washed for ablution, i.e. all the feet up to the ankles. If any part is uncovered, wiping over them is invalid. Ibn Taymiyyah differs with such a ruling and makes it clear in his Fatawa that this condition has no firm basis. 3-They should be permissible to wear. It is not permissible to wipe over the khuffs or socks if they are taken from their owner by force, or stolen, or made of silk because wearing silk is forbidden for men. 4-They should be pure, as it is not allowed to wipe over khuffs made of something impure, such as the hide of donkey.\n\n5-Using the concession within the time allowed.

In the same manner, one cannot wipe over footgear that is worn over bandages. After performing minor ablution, one needs to wear ...\n\nAccording to Maliki School, there is no time limit for the permissibility of wiping over the footgear. As long as nothing happens, which requires major ablution, one may continue to wipe over the footgear. However, it is recommended for those who go to Friday Prayer to take of the footgear and wash the feet on Fridays. The time for the permissibility of wiping over footgear does not begin at the moment when one wears the footgear. The time begins after something that nullifies the minor ablution happens. For example, if one performs the minor ablution and wears the footgear at 6 o’clock and something that nullifies the minor ablution happens at 10 o’clock, the time of permissibility of wiping over footgear begins at 10 o’clock. If the time for the permissibility of wiping over the footgear ends. If the footgear (even one of them) is taken off intentionally or unintentionally.\n\nThe leather footgear which covers the foot up to the ankle bone (including the ankle bone), and by which it is possible to walk is called khuff in Arabic. Wiping over khuff, a limb, or the bandages wrapped around a wound with wet hands is termed as mash. Islam is a religion which always provides easiness in times of difficulty. Wiping over a mast or a bandage during ablution is a convenience provided by Islam in times of hardship just as the convenience of performing dry ablution in times of lack of water or when it is not possible to use water. There are six conditions for the permissibility of wiping over footgear: Footgear must be worn while in the state of minor ablution. One needs to perform the minor ablution first, and then wear both khuffs. It is not an acceptable way if the person wears the right footgear after washing the right foot and wears the left footgear after washing the left foot.\n\nThe footgear must be clean. There should not be any impurity on or in them. It is not permissible to wear footgear made from un-tanned animal skin as khuffs. The footgear must cover the parts of the feet that need to be washed in minor ablution: They should cover all parts of the foot up to the ankle bone (including the ankle bone). Footgear with ties or zips must be kept tied or zipped after wearing them at all times. There should not be any torn part or hole on the parts of the footgear covering the obligatory parts of the foot. The footgear must be durable enough to continuously walk with them. They should be durable enough to walk three days and nights (about 135 km). It is not appropriate to wear footgear made from excessively thin leather, wool socks, or irritating materials and footgear that are either too large or too tight. The footgear should not let water reach the feet.\n\nThere should not be anything worn over the footgear (khuff) when wiping over them. For example if someone wears shoes over the khuff, he cannot wipe over the shoes. In the same manner, one cannot wipe over footgear that is worn over bandages. After performing minor ablution, one needs to wear footgear before anything nullifying the state of minor ablution happens. If the footgear has zip, it should be zipped after wearing. After time passes and something nullifying minor ablution happens, the person wearing the footgear (khuff) should perform minor ablution again. When it comes to washing the feet, the person instead washes his hands. By his wet right hand, he wipes his right foot from its fingers up to the ankle, while wiping the underneath the right foot beginning from the heel down to fingers by wet left hand. Then the same process is done to the left foot and wiping over the footgear is completed.",

The turban may also be called a khimar (head cover), as in Sahih Muslim: “He wiped over his khuffs and khimar. He said: That is, the turban.” Thus the word khimar was explained as referring to the turban. Were it not for this explanation, we would have said that it was permissible to wipe over the ghutrah if it is covering the head, just as it is permissible for a woman to wipe over her khimar.\"(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ 1/236). Shaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The cap is something that is worn on the head to protect it from the sun and heat, and it is shaped to fit the size of the head, but does not usually cover the ears.\n\nis wiping over the forelock [the front of the head] and turban. It was narrated from al-Mughirah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did wudu, and he wiped over his forelock and over his turban and over his khuffs. Narrated by al-Bukhari (182) and Muslim (274). ... is wiping over the turban only. It was narrated that ‘Amr ibn Umayyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiping over his turban and khuffs. Narrated by al-Bukhari (205). Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) acted in accordance with these hadiths. See: Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (1/120). The majority of scholars are of the view that it is not valid to only wipe the turban when doing wudu, and that if someone does that, his wudu is not valid. We have discussed this previously and noted that the view of Imam Ahmad is more likely to be sound, in the answer to question no.\n\nIs the ruling on taking off the turban after wiping over it in wudu’ the same as the ruling regarding the khuffs?\n\nIn the answer to question no. 70530 , we stated that the correct view is that it is obligatory to wipe over the entire head when doing wudu, and this is the view of Imam Malik and Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them). According to the Malikis, it is not permissible to wipe over the turban except in the case of necessity, which is if the wearer fears harm if he takes it off. If part of his head is uncovered, he must wipe it, then carry on and wipe over the turban, and this is obligatory, as it says in Hashiyat al-‘Adawi (1/195). It says in ash-Sharh al-Kabir (1/163), which is a Maliki book: If he can wipe over part of his head, he should do that, then carry on wiping over the turban, and this is obligatory according to the correct view.

When that amount of area is wiped, the obligation is fulfilled. This is the view of the Ḥanafis.[5] According to the Malikis, the entire upper part of the khuff must be wiped, whereas according to the Ḥanbalis, most of the upper part must be wiped, and according to the Shafiʿis, an area up to a finger from the top must be wiped to fulfill the obligation. According to the Ḥanafis and the Ḥanbalis, having the fingers separated while wiping and starting from the toes and making it towards the leg is the proper way of wiping according to the sunnah. However, according to the Shafiʿis, the sunnah way to perform wiping is to place the right hand on the toes and the left hand on the heel.\n\nAccording to the Malikis, the mandūb way to perform wiping is to place the right hand on the tip of the toes and the left hand under the toes. It is narrated from Mughira b. Shu’ba (ra) that he said: “The Prophet (saw) wiped over his khuffs. He placed his right hand on his right khuff. He placed his left hand on his left khuff, and then wiped upwards only once.”[6] Yet, it is sufficient to pour some water over the khuffs, wipe them with something like a wet cloth or sponge, wipe them crosswise, or start the wiping from the leg of the khuff. However, it is important to know that these acts do not comply with the sunnah. Moreover, wiping under the khuffs is not considered permissible. The khuffs should be worn after washing the feet for wuḍū because, in the hadith reported by Mughira (ra), the Prophet (saw) said to him, “leave the khuffs as I put them on after performing the ablution.”[7] On the other hand, wiping over the foot or over a bandage due to a legitimate justification is also \n\nAccording to the Ḥanafis, the khuffs should be robust enough to walk a long way, approximately 6 km. According to the Shafiʿis, the ruling regarding the robustness of the khuffs differs between that of a traveler and a resident. For the travelers, the footwear needs to be strong enough to walk with them for three days and nights, while for the residents it is a day and a night. The Malikis do not require any measure for robustness since the khuffs are made from leather and they are recognized as already having a certain level of robustness. The Ḥanbalis hold a similar view stating that the issue of robustness needs to be left to the customary practices of the people. The khuffs should not have holes on them. Accordingly, there should not be a hole, slit, or tear in the khuffs below the ankles or below or above the khuffs. However, minute holes are excused by some schools.\n\nThe views regarding the excused amount of the holes differ among the schools. According to the Ḥanafis, the holes cannot be bigger than the size of where three little toes can enter. According to the Shafiʿis and the Ḥanbalis, even if the tear is a small one, it is not permissible to wear it as khuffs. According to the Malikis, there is no limit for the holes. As long as it is called khuffs, one can wear them and wipe over them while performing the wuḍū. The khuffs must be thick enough to stand untied. Most of the jurists, except for the Malikis, consider wiping permissible on khuffs made of leather, thick felt, cloth, and similar materials. However, the Ḥanafis and the Shafiʿis stipulate that khuffs should be of a nature that does not immediately let the water penetrate to the skin. According to them, the existence of this condition is also considered to be implied in the texts that indicate the legitimacy of the wiping over khuffs.",

Sometimes or most of the time we’re at work or outside the house, and taking off our shoes or socks to perform Wudu isn’t easy. That’s when we start wondering, “is it permissible to perform Wudu with socks or not?” · Islam makes a ruling for every case to ease our lives, and that includes ablution. For example, let’s say you want to perform Wudu but you can’t take off khuffs because the ground is not clean, that’s when you choose to wipe over the khuff instead of taking it off. Now, let’s understand the khuffain meaning, the conditions of wiping over, and how to do so. khuff meaning in Islam is what covers the feet like socks or shoes. Khuff is what you wear to protect your feet like socks or shoes and it could be made of various materials and shapes.\n\nWiping over the Khuff o socks during ablution is permissible as stated by many scholars and hadiths. Especially if you can’t remove them because the ground is not clean or if there are any hazardous materials on the ground. The Prophet (peace and blessing be upon him) used to wipe over the Khuff whether at home or on a journey. Al-Hasan (may Allah have mercy upon him) said: “I was told by seventy of the Companions of Allah’s Messenger ( peace and blessing be upon him) that he used to wipe over his Khuffs (with his wet hands during ablution).” · Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy upon him) said, “The permissibility of wiping over the Khuffs was reported by innumerable Companions.” · Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy upon him) said: “There is not a shadow of doubt in my mind concerning the legality of wiping over the Khuffs, as there are forty Hadeeths of the Prophet ( peace and blessing be upon him) indicating its permissibility.” ·\n\nWe now know that wiping over khuff socks is allowed and we don’t have to remove them when performing ablution. But how do we wipe over them? The prophet (peace and blessing be upon him) used to wipe over the top of the Khuff. From this, we understand that we should wipe over the top of the Khuff, not the bottom, or the back of it, or the wiping will be invalid. Al-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah described how the prophet (peace and blessing be upon him) used to wipe over the Khuff and said: “I saw the Prophet (peace be upon him) wiping over his khuffs, on their top.” ... “Had things in religion always been based on logic, the bottom of the khuffs would have been more appropriate to wipe upon than the top. I saw Allah’s messenger wiping over the top of his khuffs.” · Al-Mardaawi said in al-Insaaf: “The Sunnah way of wiping (over the khuffayn) is to put the hands with the fingers outspread on the toes, then draw the hands up towards the shins once on the right and left feet.” ·\n\nIt’s a sunnah to wipe the top of the khuffayn. Also, it is a sunnah to wipe both of the Kuffayn at the same time but it’s not obligatory.",

Thus, if a person left out part of the topside, any prayers he prayed with that wudu’would be invalid, and if a person left out part of the underside, it would be recommended for him to repeat, in theikhtiyari time, any prayers he prayed with that wudu’.

If the khuff is so large that it will slip off when he walks with it (or so tight that it is impossible to walk whilst wearing it, or so thin that it will tear when he walks on it), then it is not permitted to wipe over it. 6. That there is no barrier between the water and the khuff, such as wax and the like. There are five preconditions relating to the person who performs the wiping. (If any of these preconditions are lacking then it is not permitted for that person to wipe over the khuff): 1. That he put them on when he was in a state of ritual purity (i.e. he must be inwudu’ before he puts them on). If he put them on when he was not in a state of ritual purity then he may not wipe over them and he must remove them when he wants to perform wudu’. 2. That his state of ritual purity was obtained using water, not earth (in other words, he may not performtayammum in order to put on his khuffsand then still wipe over them, it must be wudu’).\n\n1. Those things which make ghuslobligatory: That is to say, the insertion of the head of the penis into the vagina (or anus, which is forbidden), the emission of semen, the onset of menstruation and the onset of lochia (post-natal bleeding). If one is in a state of major ritual impurity then it is invalid to wipe over the khuff until such time as he has removed the state of major ritual impurity by performing aghusl. 2. Rips or tears in the khuff amounting to a third the length of the foot or more, regardless of whether those tears have opened up to reveal the foot beneath or whether the two sides of the tears are still holding together in places (such as when the stitching has come apart, but parts of the leather are still stuck together). If the rips or tears amount to less than a third the length of the foot, then wiping over the khuff is valid, except when the rips have completely opened up to reveal the foot beneath.",

There are some scholars who say that in the hadith shareef there is no distinction between thick or\n\nFrom this, it is evident that khuff means socks made from leather. All the four Imams and scholars of Islam have clearly stated that masah is permissible on these socks. There are no differences regarding this since the leather socks (khuff) have been explicitly mentioned in the Ahadith. As for the cotton socks and the nylon socks that are commonly worn today, it is about these the Fuqaha have given details about. ... 2. A person can walk with these socks (alone) to a distance of three miles without the socks being torn. 3. It is so thick that water is not able to seep through the socks to enter the feet. 4. A person is not able to see his feet through the socks. According to the Mazhab of Imam Malik (A.R.), it states that these socks, (cotton or cloth) must be made with leather inside and outside so that it resembles the leather socks (Khufain) and a person may be able to walk upon them.\n\nVolume 1, Book 4, Number 201:Narrated ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar:Sa’d bin Abi Waqqas said, “The Prophet passed wet hands over his Khuffs.” ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar asked Umar about it. ‘Umar replied in the affirmative and added, “Whenever Sa’d narrates a Hadith from the Prophet, there is no need to ask anyone else about it · .”Volume 1, Book 4, Number 202:Narrated Al-Mughlra bin Shu’ba:Once Allah’s Apostle went out to answer the call of nature and I followed him with a tumbler containing water, and when he finished, I poured water and he performed ablution and passed wet hands over his Khuffs.

All the traditions you have narrated have mentioned the word “Khuffs”. Khuff itself means leather socks. In the famous Arabic dictionary, ‘Al Mujam Al Waseet’ khuff is defined as, ‘That which is worn upon the foot and made of thin leather’. Similarly, in the dictionary of Islamic legal terminology (Mujam Lughah Al Fuqaha), khuff is defined as ‘Boot made of light leather’. (Mujam Lughah Al Fuqaha Pg. 197 – Idaratul Quran Wal Uloom Al Islamiya Karachi Pakistan). In Al Qamoos al Fiqhi, khuff is defined as ‘That which is worn upon the foot and made of thin leather’ (Al Qamoos Al Fiqhi Pg. 118 – Idaratul Quran Wal Uloom Al Islamiya Karachi Pakistan).",

Though the scholars disputed much in issues of wudu and Salah, they ensured that none of that should lead to division among Muslims or abandonment of praying behind others.

                "text": "This is the view of the Ḥanafis.[5] According to the Malikis, the entire upper part of the khuff must be wiped, whereas according to the Ḥanbalis, most of the upper part must be wiped, and according to the Shafiʿis, an area up to a finger from the top must be wiped to fulfill the obligation.\n\nAccording to the Ḥanafis, the khuffs should be robust enough to walk a long way, approximately 6 km. According to the Shafiʿis, the ruling regarding the robustness of the khuffs differs between that of a traveler and a resident. For the travelers, the footwear needs to be strong enough to walk with them for three days and nights, while for the residents it is a day and a night. The Malikis do not require any measure for robustness since the khuffs are made from leather and they are recognized as already having a certain level of robustness. The Ḥanbalis hold a similar view stating that the issue of robustness needs to be left to the customary practices of the people. The khuffs should not have holes on them. Accordingly, there should not be a hole, slit, or tear in the khuffs below the ankles or below or above the khuffs. However, minute holes are excused by some schools.\n\nThe views regarding the excused amount of the holes differ among the schools. According to the Ḥanafis, the holes cannot be bigger than the size of where three little toes can enter. According to the Shafiʿis and the Ḥanbalis, even if the tear is a small one, it is not permissible to wear it as khuffs. According to the Malikis, there is no limit for the holes. As long as it is called khuffs, one can wear them and wipe over them while performing the wuḍū. The khuffs must be thick enough to stand untied. Most of the jurists, except for the Malikis, consider wiping permissible on khuffs made of leather, thick felt, cloth, and similar materials. However, the Ḥanafis and the Shafiʿis stipulate that khuffs should be of a nature that does not immediately let the water penetrate to the skin. According to them, the existence of this condition is also considered to be implied in the texts that indicate the legitimacy of the wiping over khuffs.\n\nThe obligatory amount of wiping the feet is equal to the amount of the smallest three fingers of the hand, on the khuff that coincides with the front of each foot. When that amount of area is wiped, the obligation is fulfilled. This is the view of the Ḥanafis.[5] According to the Malikis, the entire upper part of the khuff must be wiped, whereas according to the Ḥanbalis, most of the upper part must be wiped, and according to the Shafiʿis, an area up to a finger from the top must be wiped to fulfill the obligation. According to the Ḥanafis and the Ḥanbalis, having the fingers separated while wiping and starting from the toes and making it towards the leg is the proper way of wiping according to the sunnah. However, according to the Shafiʿis, the sunnah way to perform wiping is to place the right hand on the toes and the left hand on the heel.\n\nAccording to the Malikis, the mandūb way to perform wiping is to place the right hand on the tip of the toes and the left hand under the toes. It is narrated from Mughira b. Shu’ba (ra) that he said: “The Prophet (saw) wiped over his khuffs. He placed his right hand on his right khuff. He placed his left hand on his left khuff, and then wiped upwards only once.”[6] Yet, it is sufficient to pour some water over the khuffs, wipe them with something like a wet cloth or sponge, wipe them crosswise, or start the wiping from the leg of the khuff. However, it is important to know that these acts do not comply with the sunnah. Moreover, wiping under the khuffs is not considered permissible. The khuffs should be worn after washing the feet for wuḍū because, in the hadith reported by Mughira (ra), the Prophet (saw) said to him, “leave the khuffs as I put them on after performing the ablution.”[7] On the other hand, wiping over the foot or over a bandage due to a legitimate justification is also ",

However, several Companions of the Prophet such as ʿAlī, Ibn Masʿūd, Ibn ʿUmar, Anas, ʿAmmār ibn Yāsir, Bilāl, al-Barā’, Abū Umāmah and Sahl ibn Saʿd (ra) did not restrict this concession only to leather socks but applied it to anything analogous to them as well.[4] This includes socks made from wool or cotton, and even applies to shoes since they serve a similar purpose. However, most scholars excluded socks which are very thin and semi-transparent, because they are not properly analogous to the types of socks that the Prophet ﷺ wore. The reasoning they gave is that their function is different, so socks which are permissible to wipe over should be thick enough to be able to walk around in, on average terrain.\n\nSummarized Answer It is permissible to wipe over your socks, in all circumstances, whether or not it is inconvenient, only if the following conditions are met: you must have worn the socks while you were in a state of wuḍū’, the socks must be thick enough that water does not seep through to your foot as you are wiping, each sock must cover the entire foot including the ankles [some tears or holes are overlooked] and you must wipe over the upper surface of the socks using your hand. Background of the Issue It is a mercy from Allah ﷻ that he allowed us an exemption from having to take off our socks every time we perform wuḍū’. It is even more of a mercy that this is allowed to do so even when there is no hardship involved. However, this exception comes with conditions and prerequisites. We have observed many Muslims making major mistakes when it comes to understanding the concession regarding wiping over socks.",

                "text": "The view of the majority of scholars is that it is not allowed to wipe over thin socks, and that the permissibility of wiping over socks is limited to thick socks.\n\n“The permissibility of wiping over the socks was narrated from nine of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him: ‘Ali ibn Abu Talib, ‘Ammar ibn Yasir, Abu Mas`ud, Anas ibn Malik, Ibn `Umar, Al-Bara’ ibn `Azib, Bilal, Abu Umamah and Sahl ibn Sa`d.” (Al-Awsat, 1/462) Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Abu Dawud added Abu Umamah, `Amr ibn Hurayth, `Umar and Ibn `Abbas. Thus there were thirteen Companions (who held this view). So the view that wiping over socks is permissible is based on these Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), not the Hadith of Abu Qays. Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that it is permissible to wipe over the socks, and he said that the report of Ibn Qays was flawed. That stems from his fair-mindedness and justice, may Allah have mercy on him. Rather he based it on the view of these Companions, and by clear analogy, because there is no clear difference between socks and Khuff that would make the\n\nIt is established in the Prophet’s Sunnah that one may wipe over the khuff (a kind of leather socks that covers the ankle). The majority of scholars include socks under this ruling . What is meant by socks, as was stated by Al-Khalil Al-Farahidi (may Allah have mercy on him), is a covering for the feet. (See Al-‘Ayn, 6/113) In Mawahib Al-Jalil (1/318) it says: “Socks are a kind of footwear in the shape of the Khuff, made of linen, cotton or other fabric.” · The difference between socks and Khuff is that the Khuff are made of leather, whereas socks are not made of leather; rather they are made of wool, linen, cotton or other fabrics. At the present time, socks are also made of nylon (or synthetic fabrics). There is no authentic report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about wiping over socks . With regard to the Hadith narrated by At-Tirmidhi (99) via Abu Qays from Huzayl ibn Shurahbil from Al-Mughirah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The \n\nAl-Mufaddal ibn Ghassan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “I asked Yahya ibn Ma`in about this Hadith and he said: All the narrators narrated it in reference to the Khuff , apart from Abu Qays.” (As-Sunan Al-Kubra by Al-Bayhaqi, 1/284) Among those who also classed it as inauthentic were Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Imam Ahmad, Ibn Ma`in, Muslim, An-Nasa’i, Al-`Uqayli, Ad-Daraqutni and Al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on them). An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “These are the leading scholars of Hadith. Although At-Tirmidhi said it was a sound Hadith, these scholars take precedence over him; in fact if any one of them was the only one to hold that view, he would still take precedence over At-Tirmidhi, according to the consensus of the people of knowledge.” (Al-Majmu` Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 1/500) There are authentic reports about wiping over the socks from the Companions.\n\nThat is because the ruling on socks is the same as the ruling on the Khuff, and the Khuff can only be thick, so socks cannot take the place of the Khuff unless they are like them. Al-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If (the socks) are thin and let water through , then it is not permissible to wipe over them, according to scholarly consensus.” (Bada’i` As-Sana’i`, 1/10) Ibn Al-Qattan Al-Fasi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “All scholars unanimously agreed that if the socks are not thick, it is not permissible to wipe over them.” (Al-Iqna` fi Masa’il Al-Ijma`, no. 351) Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to wipe over socks, like the khuff, or not?",

This means that if your small crack is less than one-third the length of your foot, and it doesn't completely expose your foot, you can still wipe over the khuffs.\n\nAdditionally, small holes that do not transfer water to the interior of the socks when wiped with wet hands are considered harmless according to the Maliki position.\n\nRegarding your specific situation with a tiny crack on the bottom that light gets through: According to the Malikis, there is no specific limit for holes. As long as it is still called khuffs, one can wear them and wipe over them while performing wudu.\n\nThe evidence for the permissibility of wiping over khuffs in general comes from numerous hadiths. Al-Hasan reported that seventy Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) confirmed that he used to wipe over his khuffs with wet hands during ablution.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the Maliki position, if:\n1. Your leather socks still qualify as khuffs\n2. The crack is small (less than one-third the length of your foot)\n3. The crack doesn't completely expose your foot\n4. The crack doesn't allow water to transfer through when wiping\n\nThen you can still wipe over them for wudu. The tiny crack that merely allows light through appears to be well within the acceptable limits according to the Maliki madhab.",
