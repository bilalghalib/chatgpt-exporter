This event brought together representatives from diverse sectors, including academia, engineering, local government, NGOs, and sustainability-focused organizations. The insights and feedback gathered from this engagement emphasized integrating local heritage practices with modern sustainability techniques and addressing the unique challenges of reconstruction in Iraq.\n\n#### Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n1. **Integrating Local Heritage Practices with Sustainability:**\n   - Utilize traditional architectural elements, such as natural cooling techniques, to blend cultural preservation with sustainability.\n   - Develop a catalog of effective indigenous practices to inspire sustainable building retrofits and designs.\n\n2. **Focus on Practical and Experiential Learning:**\n   - Prioritize hands-on training, such as energy audits, solar installations, and material workshops.\n   - Leverage Mosul as a \"living laboratory\" to enhance learning through real-world applications.\n\n3. **Development of Sustainability Mindsets:**\n   - Emphasize long-term education and awareness campaigns to instill sustainable practices.\n   - Incorporate flipped classrooms, user-generated content, and community engagement initiatives to foster active participation.\n\n4. **Addressing Economic and Technical Challenges:**\n   - Acknowledge barriers such as government energy subsidies, upfront costs of sustainable solutions, and market inefficiencies.\n   - Design affordable and contextually relevant programs to enhance adoption.\n\n5. **Utilizing Local Expertise and Resources:**\n   - Engage local universities, such as the University of Mosul, and new sustainability departments to integrate academic knowledge into training.\n   - Use locally sourced materials and recycle construction waste for economic resilience and sustainability.\n\n6. **Improving Home Energy Efficiency:**\n   - Focus on practical solutions, such as efficient water heating, improved insulation, and energy-efficient appliances.\n\n#### Curriculum Design Based on Meetup Outcomes\n\nThe curriculum will incorporate the following elements, derived from stakeholder feedback:\n- **Domains:** Site sustainability, water efficiency, energy efficiency, materials, and indoor environmental quality.\n- **Key Topics:** Solar systems, sustainable housing design, energy auditing, and financial literacy.\n- **Methods:** Experiential learning, green space excursions, and innovation hackathons.\n\n#### Stakeholder Contributions\n- Representatives from organizations such as Mosul Space, Qaf Labs, and Riyada for Business offered valuable perspectives on technical and community engagement strategies.\n- Contributions from professors and engineers emphasized blending traditional techniques with modern sustainable engineering.\n\nThese insights serve as a blueprint to ensure the curriculum is aligned with BEIT's goals, culturally relevant, and capable of addressing the sustainability challenges in Mosul.",
