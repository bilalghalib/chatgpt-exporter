  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is working on restructuring a 5-day workshop focused on building design and energy efficiency in Mosul. They provided a detailed transcript describing their proposed shift from values-based themes (using Arabic concepts like العلم for knowledge, الجمال والمنفعة for beauty and benefit) to component-based themes that follow a building construction sequence. The new structure progresses from \"First Principles & Pain Points\" through \"Materials & Supplier Trust,\" \"Roofs & BOQ Reality,\" \"Walls, Windows & Wellness,\" and concluding with \"Innovation & System Change.\"\n\nThe user requested Claude to review their overview and provide an updated 5-day table along with minimum and maximum slide change recommendations. Their workshop maintains a consistent \"learn/apply/sell\" framework across all days, emphasizing comfort, style, and cost considerations. The content includes technical elements like thermal scanning, R-values, U-values, BIM to BOQ workflows, and supplier relationship building, all contextualized for the Mosul climate and local building practices.\n\nClaude provided a comprehensive response including a detailed 5-day overview table preserving the user's component-based approach, minimum implementation changes focusing on updating theme headers and reframing opening questions while keeping existing content, and maximum recommended changes involving visual component trackers, restructured material flow, and enhanced imagery. The response emphasized that 90% of existing content could remain unchanged, requiring primarily repackaging from a \"learning values\" narrative to \"building better homes, component by component.\" Claude also suggested a phased implementation approach spanning three weeks, from minimum updates to full visual refresh with component-specific animations and storytelling elements featuring a character named Ahmed whose house serves as a case study throughout the workshop progression.",

I'm gonna be going over this document with some people at the IPC.\n00:07 Um, and I think, uh, I tried to get it set up well on day one so that it's very clear what we're gonna be doing.\n00:14 Um, so that we can update the rest of the slides accordingly. Uh, and so basically what are the three influences, what a client is choosing a design for a new home.\n00:21 Um, and, uh, you know, get people- start thinking about why did you become an architect. And then you go into this, cost, reputation, and style.\n00:30 And then I wanna show them, like, all this weird, like, stuff that really doesn't suit the Iraq, like, you see that the windows, um, it's just uh, you know, it doesn't have any, uh, relevance for the environment.\n00:44 Like, look at this,this most specially in the middle here. Um,and like, sss. Seriously, look at that. It just makes no sense.\n00:51 Uh, and so how did we go from this to this? And so the idea is, this is what we're gonna do.\n00:56 We're going to, hopefully, over the next five days, uh, develop a new copy and paste home design template. That's easy to replicate.\n01:08 Um, we're gonna inspire architecture firms to blend heritage with them. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And we're gonna spark a public conversation. So this is going to be a, it's gonna be a, um, design files.\n01:23 This is going to be, um, firms judging presentations, Thank for your patience. And maybe I should put this one first.\n01:42 Okay. And then this one's going to be sharing on social media. Our progress. Okay. So this is stuff that has to happen over there every day.\n01:54 This is gonna come at the end. And this is gonna come at the end. Okay. Um, and then we will do this by learning the- principles of local, heritage, and climate smart design.\n02:04 Umm, uhh, applying them to a real, to design a home for a real person. And we're gonna pitch the solution on day five.\n02:19 Umm, maybe this is where we can talk about the installation. Uhh, share- Yeah. Our solutions. Daily social media posts to inspire others when we get feedback.\n02:40 Okay, so this is it. This is like the big picture. I wanna make it very, very clear what we're doing.\n02:45 Does that make sense? So we say, okay, well, umm, uhh, why did you become an architect? You know, I'll get some ice breaking.\n02:52 And then what are the three main influences on a client that's using a design for a new home? We're gonna be talking about the cost.\n02:59 Umm. And. You know what, let's switch this. Uh, yeah, you know what? Umm, cost, reputation of family style. Let's put style on day two.\n03:19 Or part two. Style. Style and influence. And then reputation of family. And so the idea is, we can work on cost.\n03:42 We can work on reducing cost. And 18. So. So, Maybe we can call this, like, modern, copy, cat style. Now, .\n04:25 Like how it's just really hard to put things, because of all the ITC logos everywhere, and like, just make sense.\n04:33 I think we don't have to actually have the ITC logo down here, around every page. Like, the base, I don't think that's necessary.\n04:41 You can probably just go like that. All right. I said that one. Yeah. Okay. Thank very much. How do we go from this to this?\n05:18 You know, the next five days talk about that. Umm, learn. What is your job as an architect? Solve people's problems?\n05:26 Is this the future? Is this the past? Umm, what influences the comfort levels of the home? Actually, maybe we should put something fast.\n05:37 It's time and everything else. I think we need to put a new plate there. Yeah, that's nice. Cost and comfort.\n06:00 I know they're different. We should just try to keep it at one cost. Style. We'll make it three, we can make it- Uh-huh.\n06:40 So, what are the influences? What influences a client. Yeah. Yeah. When choosing a design for a new home.\n06:53 What influences a client. Cost, style, influence, comfort, representation of family. We can work on reducing cost. And making things stylish.\n07:09 And while increasing. Okay, cool. So that's the goal. So reduce cost, increase style, and comfort. And then we go over there and say, modern copycast style.\n07:35 Umm. Past? Past? That's good. Okay. So, yeah, can you, uh, see if we're doing this? So you can take the whole presentation.\n08:01 presentation. next board as a text and say, okay, this is our goal. We're trying to go every day. And by the end, have a new copy based, um, uh, have more social media posts every day, getting, talking about the beauty and practicality of climate as my home's and inspiring for him to do that.\n08:19 And we're going to do that by learning and leveraging. Thank having me. The principles of local heritage and climate smart design.\n08:33 Applying them to a home for a real family and sharing solutions. So then after this, we actually connect them to their personas.\n08:46 Okay, so maybe we should do that faster. Okay, so. We'll do this. We're going to do all that. Umm, ah, we'll do this by 2.\n08:59 Reduce cost while increasing comfort. And. and Okay. And then we can say. Speaking of cost. And then we do the financial pre-assessment quiz.\n09:29 And then from there we get into the learn second. So what is your job as an architect? Okay, so they have two challenges, they have heat, and they have moulds, and then we're gonna connect into the team, so.\n10:12 Yeah, so, better than that. Yeah, how about that? We go, what is your job to architect? Let's do this. This is a real person.\n10:27 No family. We're connecting you to your teams and your. We will do this for a local.\n10:49 Oh. Local family. family. Okay. So I got connected to the family, and these are the problems as the past is the future.\n11:28 So. Oh, actually, this is kind of interesting. We can actually have the days be about comfort, cost, comfort. So we start with comfort, and then we go to style, and then we end on cost.\n11:44 So comfort is all about this stuff. First principles, and then we learn about these, then we apply. So the apply section, I want them to go around bit throughout the muscle, and come up with, uh, this investigation method.\n12:00 Look for the different principles, measure them. Think about, umm, think. And then come up with the principle, and then find its modern usage.\n12:13 And they're gonna go and do the measurements, and color code it. And then if we need, we can actually walk them through these different things.\n12:24 And we sell. And so I need to come up. Up with this equation. Umm, and then which heritage design might help?\n12:31 Actually, all of this might be, we just, for now, hide it. Umm, and then which heritage design, right? So, this is just kind of going through the client discovery, thinking about your clients, and, um, thinking about, you know, what you learned in the heritage, uh, house, and what might actually help\n12:49 them. Umm, there's no rotation. We already did this, actually. This is part of this. Okay. And then, so, think about the feelings, what they see, their pain, again.\n13:14 And then use that to map it to a, um, uh, heritage inspired item. You know, a lot of the things here, this is like retrofitting, okay?\n13:35 Uh, we need to focus on things that, um. Let's see, example's gonna be window shades. Umm, the client pen. Umm, upper floor rooms, too hot.\n13:56 And so, uh, example, window shades, or airf- window installations. Okay. And then you have to come up with the cost.\n14:12 Okay? See, it's about, sign up. It's not an upgrade. Call roof design. Cause this is architecture. It's the new home.\n14:25 It's not retrofitting, okay? Expanding, like, on five challenge, I don't think we should do that. Voluntary share. So, then we just ask people to share what they did today.\n14:36 That's fine. Okay, so that's day one. I did day one, and I think it sets up everything for the rest of the days.\n14:42 Umm, does it make sense? I kind of like this idea of going through the comfort style and cost. And so, like, If you look at the days, we might have to modify this.\n14:55 Over here. What is the days? Days. Yeah. And for here, this is going to be theme, understanding first principles is going to be comfort.\n15:08 Right? And this is still comfort. And then this might be style. Yeah. See, this is, it's mostly comfort. How do we work on style?\n15:30 I don't really know. Innovation. Realist and realistic ones. Actually, every day we work on style when we pitch things. Okay.\n15:38 Y'know, I'm gonna go pray now. I'll be on the exporter's day that I call real suppliers. So all of these probably might need a change based on how I set things up on day one.\n15:47 What do you think?"

Now, let’s get into today’s schedule with our Daily Agenda and 3‑Block Rhythm.”\n3\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n[09:15–09:20] – Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, LEARN—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, APPLY—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, SELL—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. Structure: Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. Engagement: Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. Progress: Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: Participants lose sight of the agenda  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: Time-keeping slips\n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n4\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding first principles (comfort)\nLearn why modern home designs have difficulties for Mosul’s environment and how green/heritage designs solve them.\u000bUse IR cameras & empathy maps to find and explain pain.\n2\nMaterials & Trust\nExplore what works for Mosul. Test courtyard ideas, meet suppliers, and pitch comfort ROI.\n3\nRoofs & Realistic Wins\nUse BIM to export roof data, call real suppliers, and build honest BOQs with price proof.\n4\nWalls, Windows & Wellness\nCompare costs and proof types. Fix BOQs, respond to objections, and share proof that works.\n5\nInnovation & Enterprise\nSimulate energy savings, finish your design pack, and give a pitch for system change.\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:20 – 09:25 Day 1‑5 Overview] (5 min)\nPurpose\nGive participants a clear “big‑picture” of the week’s Learn → Apply → Sell rhythm across five days.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Participants seated, facing the screen.\nMaterials needed: Projector, pointer or clicker, overview slide loaded.\nPre‑activity checks: Slide legible from the back; pointer works; timer visible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s step back and see our week at a glance. On this table, each row is a day—Day 1 through Day 5—and each column is one of our three blocks: Learn, Apply, and Sell.”\u000b “Day 1 we focus on first principles: you’ll learn why modern designs struggle here, apply heritage tactics with IR guns and empathy maps, then sell your pain‑to‑price insight. Day 2 deepens Materials & Trust; Day 3 roofs and price‑proof BOQs; Day 4 walls, windows, and handling objections; and Day 5 is our full Innovation & Enterprise sprint and final pitch.”\nKey Points\nDaily Rhythm: Each day is structured Learn → Apply → Sell.\nSkill Progression: We move from foundational concepts to advanced enterprise-level pitching.\nOutcome Focus: Every afternoon Sell block gives you a tangible deliverable or pitch.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1: Point with the pointer across one example row (e.g., Day 1).\nStep 2: Briefly describe each block in that row (Learn – theory; Apply – hands‑on; Sell – pitch).\nStep 3: Ask participants to raise a finger for the day/block they’re most excited about (10 s).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Slide feels text‑heavy.\nSolution: Focus on one row or column at a time; keep your explanation brief.\nIssue: Participants read ahead instead of listening.\nSolution: Dim the slide briefly after each row to draw attention back to you.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—you now know where we’re headed. Let’s dive into Day 1’s first Learn block: understanding first principles of comfort and heritage design.”\n5\n\nDay 1\nخيرُ الناسِ أنفعُهم للناسِ\n“The best of people are those that are of the most benefit to people.\nHadith Prophet Muhammed (S)\n[09:00 - 09:05 – Opening & Welcome] (5 min)\nPurpose\nTo warmly welcome participants, set a positive tone, and introduce the trainer.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer stands center front; participants seated facing screen.\nMaterials needed: Projector with slide loaded.\nPre‑activity checks: Confirm slide displays correctly; microphone/audio working.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Green Architecture & Heritage‑Inspired Design workshop. I’m [Trainer Name], and I’ll be guiding you over the next five days as we explore how traditional wisdom can solve today’s housing challenges.”\u000b “Let me start with a thought from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):”\u000b (Read slide)\n“The best of people are those that are of the most benefit to people.”\u000b “This workshop is built on that principle—our goal is to empower you to create designs that truly benefit communities.”\nKey Points\nWelcome: Establish friendly, inclusive atmosphere.\nIntroductions: Trainer name and role.\nTheme: Service and benefit as guiding value.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Last year in Mosul, a small courtyard retrofit saved a family over 30 % on fuel costs—showing how simple design can deliver big benefits.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1: Trainer briefly waves to make eye contact (30 s).\nStep 2: Ask participants to nod if they’re excited to learn (1 min).\nStep 3: Encourage any quick questions before moving on (3 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants chatting quietly.\nSolution: Pause and say, “Let’s all focus on the screen for a moment.”\nIssue: Audio distortion on slide quote.\nSolution: Repeat the quote clearly, or switch off the slide and speak directly.\u000b\nTransition\n“Thank you. Now that we’ve set our shared purpose, let’s dive into our first topic: What is the BEIT project?”\n6\n\nBuild your architecture from what is beneath your feet.\n\n- Hassan Fathy\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[10:10 - 10:20 – Build Your Architecture from What Is Beneath Your Feet] (10 min)\nPurpose\nTo connect participants with Hassan Fathy’s philosophy and spark reflection on local context.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Participants in small groups of 4 around tables.\nMaterials needed: Projector with quote slide; flipchart or paper and markers for each group.\nPre‑activity checks: Ensure groups can hear the trainer; flipchart paper and markers distributed.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Here’s a powerful line from Hassan Fathy:\n‘Build your architecture from what is beneath your feet.’\u000b What does this mean in our context—Mosul and its heritage?”\u000b (Pause 15 s for groups to read.)\u000b “Hassan Fathy believed we should use local materials, traditions, and knowledge as the foundation of design. He saw mud brick, courtyards, and local crafts not as relics, but as the very essence of sustainable architecture.”\nKey Points\nLocal Materials: Emphasize indigenous resources (mud brick, stone).\nCultural Continuity: Design that resonates with community heritage.\nSustainability: Low‑impact methods rooted in place.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul, many old houses use river‑clay brick and deep eaves—practices that naturally keep interiors cool, just like Fathy’s Nubian vaults.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1 (3 min): In your group, discuss: “Which local material or tradition could you ‘build from beneath your feet’ in your next project?”\nStep 2 (3 min): Write your top idea on flipchart paper.\nStep 3 (3 min): Each group shares one idea with the room.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Groups struggle to focus.\nSolution: Prompt with an example: “Think of mud brick or courtyard shading.”\nIssue: Loud overlaps during sharing.\nSolution: Ask each group to nominate one speaker and raise hands.\u000b\nTransition\n“Fantastic insights! Now that we’ve grounded ourselves in heritage wisdom, let’s look at our Day 1 learning objectives to see how we’ll apply these ideas.”\n7\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nIce Breakers\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nWhy did you become an architect?\n(get into pairs and share)\n[09:50 - 10:00 – Ice Breakers: “Why Are You an Architect?”] (10 min)\nPurpose\nBuild rapport, energize the group, and surface personal motivations that connect to today’s theme.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Participants break into pairs, chairs facing each other.\nMaterials needed: None.\nPre‑activity checks: Ensure everyone has a partner; clear floor space.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s get to know each other a bit. Turn to the person next to you and finish this sentence: ‘I became an architect because …’”\u000b “Share for 3 minutes—1.5 minutes each—then we’ll call for a few volunteers to summarize what they heard.”\nKey Points\nConnection: Personal stories create engagement.\nDiversity: Different motivations enrich our cohort.\nRelevance: Ties individual goals to workshop outcomes.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“One of our past participants said, ‘I build homes because my grandmother had no indoor bathroom during winter’—a powerful reminder of why design matters.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1: Pair up and share your sentence for 3 min total (1.5 min each).\nStep 2: One partner listens and remembers one key word.\nStep 3: After 3 min, call out for 2–3 volunteers to share their partner’s word and why it stood out.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Pairs start off‑topic.\nSolution: Gently remind: “Focus on the ‘because…’ prompt about architecture.”\nIssue: One partner dominates.\nSolution: Signal half‑time: “Please switch roles now.”\u000b\nTransition\n“Thanks for sharing! Hearing your ‘why’ reminds us of our purpose. Next, let’s do a quick “Guess the Architectural Icon” challenge.”\n8\n\nWhat influences a client when choosing a design for a new home?\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:35 - 09:40 – What Are the Primary Choice Criteria for a New Home?] (5 min)\nPurpose\nEngage participants by eliciting real‑world priorities and set context for the pre‑assessment quiz.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer at front with slide displayed; participants seated in a semi‑circle.\nMaterials needed: Projector with slide loaded; whiteboard or flipchart and marker.\nPre‑activity checks: Ensure marker works; slide text visible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Before we dive into our quiz, let’s tap into your experience: What matters most to people when choosing or building a new home?

Next, let’s explore wind‑tower houses from the wider Middle East.”\n39\n\nPassive Cooling - Stack-Vent\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nKey Points:\n\n🔥 Incense “heat source” at bottom\n🌫️ Smoke → warm-air path upward\n🌬️ Fresh air drawn through low openings\n\nInvestigation: Why does this work?\nBuoyancy: Warm air is lighter, so it rises\nPressure difference: Rising air pulls in cooler air\nContinuous flow: No pumps, just density gradients\n*Photo or schematic of a simple shoebox “tower” with incense inside, arrows showing smoke rising and fresh air drawn in at the base\n[12:35–12:45] – Passive Stack-Vent Cooling (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\nOne sentence explaining why\n\nSetup:\n• Physical arrangement – Demo table front-center with model visible; participants seated around.\n\nMaterials needed:\n• Shoebox tower with base hole + open top  \n• Incense stick + lighter  \n• Projector + schematic slide  \n\nPre-activity checks:\n• Model sturdy & positioned under projector  \n• Incense smoke visible in demo lighting  \n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Now let’s see stack-vent cooling in action—no fans or electricity needed. Here’s our shoebox model: incense at the bottom represents sun-warmed air. Watch as the smoke rises up the chimney and pulls fresh air in from below.”  \n*(Light incense, place in base, pause 10–15 s.)*  \n“Notice the continuous flow: as warm air exits, it draws cooler air in through the hole. That’s exactly how heritage courtyards in Mosul stayed comfortable.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Stack effect moves warm air upward naturally.  \n2. Air exchange draws in cooler ambient air at the base.  \n3. Zero energy—relies solely on buoyancy and pressure difference.  \n\nInvestigation ::\n- Buoyancy: Warm air is lighter, so it rises.  \n- Pressure difference: Exiting air creates suction at the base.  \n- Continuous flow: Sustains ventilation without fans.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In a recent Mosul retrofit, adding a 3 m courtyard shaft yielded a **4 °C drop** indoors—enough to run without generators for much of the afternoon.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Observe the smoke path—note where it rises and where air enters.  \nStep 2: In your mind, map these openings onto a real courtyard or window design.  \nStep 3: Think of one way to scale this effect up for a room or roof vent system.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Smoke too faint to follow.\n• Solution: Use a fresh incense stick; dim room lights briefly.  \nIssue: Participants focus only on smoke, not airflow.\n• Solution: Ask, “Where does the new air come from?” while pointing to the base hole.\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that we’ve seen how passive ventilation works, let’s turn about what is green building.”  \n40\n\nWind Towers\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nStack effect pulls hot air up the tower.\nCool shaded air is drawn into rooms.\nTypical temperature drop indoors: ≈ 5 °C.\nNo electricity required → “zero‑energy fan.”\n[11:20 - 11:30 – Middle‑Eastern Wind‑Tower Houses] (10 min)\nPurpose\nIllustrate how wind‑towers provide continuous, energy‑free ventilation, complementing the courtyard principle just discussed.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer stands to the left of the screen.\nMaterials needed: Slide with Bastakiya section drawing (left) and Qasr Al Hosn photo (right).\nPre‑activity checks: Confirm both images are clear; bullet text visible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Our next heritage tactic is the wind‑tower—sometimes called a ‘zero‑energy fan.’”\n“Look at the section drawing on the left. Warm air rises naturally inside the tower, escaping at the top. As it exits, it pulls cooler shaded air from the courtyard into the living spaces below.”\n“Field measurements show an indoor drop of about five degrees Celsius—all without a single watt of electricity.”\n“On the right is Qasr Al Hosn in Abu Dhabi. Those white towers still demonstrate this principle today.”\u000b\nKey Points\nStack Ventilation: Rising hot air drives continuous airflow.\nPassive Cooling: Lowers indoor temperature ≈ 5 °C.\nEnergy‑Free: Operates day and night without mechanical fans.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“An architect in Basra retrofitted a small wind‑tower on a two‑story house and reduced AC run‑time by 20 %, saving fuel costs immediately.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1 (5 min): Ask participants to trace the air path with their finger in the air—up the tower, down into rooms.\nStep 2 (2 min): Poll: ‘Could this fit your client’s plot height?’ Thumbs‑up (yes) or thumbs‑down (needs adjustment).\nStep 3 (1 min): Note one barrier shouted out (e.g., extra height, building code) on flipchart.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants confuse wind direction with stack effect.\nSolution: Emphasize: “Wind helps, but the main driver is rising warm air.”\nIssue: Concern about cost or appearance.\nSolution: Mention low‑cost prefab tower modules now available.\u000b\nTransition\n“Wind‑towers use vertical airflow. Now let’s see how horizontal shading in narrow streets and compact mass cools whole neighborhoods.”\n41\n\nMashrabiyyah\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nShading elements or screens; provide diffused light and reducing heat gain such as the traditional mashrabiya\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n[11:55 - 12:00 – Mashrabiyyah Screens] (5 min)\nPurpose\nDemonstrate how traditional wooden lattice screens (mashrabiyyah) shade interiors, diffuse daylight, and drive passive cooling.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer stands beside projected mashrabiyyah collage.\nMaterials needed: Projector with high‑resolution mashrabiyyah images.\nPre‑activity checks: Ensure images and slide title are clear.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Now let’s focus on mashrabiyyah—intricate wooden lattice screens common across the Middle East.”\n“Notice how the perforations:\u000b • Diffuse harsh sunlight, creating soft indoor lighting.\u000b • Block direct solar gain, reducing heat entering the room.\u000b • Allow airflow through the screen, enhancing cross‑ventilation.”\n“These screens are often placed on upper‑floor windows or protruding balconies, shading walls below and cooling the façade.”\u000b\nKey Points\nSolar Shading: Prevents sun from striking interior surfaces directly.\nDaylight Control: Balances light and privacy—no glare, good illumination.\nVentilation Aid: Mesh openings let air pass while limiting dust and heat.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Basra’s restored heritage district, retrofitted mashrabiyyah screens cut window‑wall temperatures by 3–4 °C on summer afternoons.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1 (2 min): Ask participants: “Which room in your client brief would most benefit from a mashrabiyyah screen?”\nStep 2 (2 min): One volunteer shares their idea and why.\nStep 3 (1 min): Trainer highlights how this links back to the “Solar” and “Airflow” principles.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants confuse mashrabiyyah with full shutters.\nSolution: Point out the lattice pattern vs. solid board.\nIssue: Concern about maintenance.\nSolution: Note that modern materials (alu‑mesh) can mimic function with less upkeep.\u000b\nTransition\n“Excellent—next we’ll look at salsabil water features and how evaporation further cools the courtyard.”\n42\n\nNarrow, Shaded Streets & Compact Mass\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMutual shading keeps walls ≈ 6 – 8 °C cooler\n1 m brick walls store heat, \u000brelease it at night.\nWinding alleys cut direct sun and channel breezes.\n[11:30 - 11:40 – Narrow, Shaded Streets & Compact Mass] (10 min)\nPurpose\nIllustrate how compact urban fabric and thick masonry walls passively lower façade temperatures and improve comfort.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer front‑left; slide full‑screen.\nMaterials needed: Projector; pointer/laser.\nPre‑activity checks: Confirm images display clearly and bullet text reads: “≈ 6 – 8 °C cooler.”\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“This slide shows Al‑Kadumia’s maze of narrow streets in Baghdad. When walls shade each other, façade surfaces run about six to eight degrees Celsius cooler than wide, sun‑exposed roads.”\n“That number comes from two field studies: one by Al‑Dujaili & Al‑Anbari (2022) in Baghdad and another 2021 capstone from the University of Mosul—both used infrared scans on historic alleys.”\n“Add thick, one‑metre brick walls and you get thermal mass that stores daytime heat and releases it after sunset.”\n“The winding alleys also channel breezes, making streets walkable even at midday.”\u000b\nKey Points\nMutual Shading: Close spacing blocks direct sun.\nThermal Mass: Thick masonry delays indoor heat peaks.\nMicro‑Climate: Narrow alleys promote airflow and social interaction.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul Old City, sensors showed a shaded alley wall at 33 °C while an open road wall nearby measured 41 °C at the same hour.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1 (3 min): Ask pairs to guess the temperature difference before revealing the 6 – 8 °C figure.\nStep 2 (2 min): Quick thumbs‑up/down: could their client plot allow a shaded side alley or shared party wall?\nStep 3 (1 min): Note one barrier or opportunity voiced.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants confuse thermal mass with insulation.\nSolution: Clarify: “Mass delays heat flow; insulation blocks it—both can work together.”\nIssue: Concern about daylight.\nSolution: Remind that windows and courtyards still supply light while streets shield harsh sun.\u000b\nTransition\n“We’ve now covered courtyard cooling, wind‑tower ventilation, and narrow‑street shading. Let’s pull these physics together in our ‘Mosul Heat & Heritage Logic’ summary slide.”\n43\n\nSalsabil\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMarble niche panel with wavy grooves evokes water and wind.\nAngled surface allows water to trickle evenly, maximizing evaporation.\nEvaporation + humidity boost cools surrounding air before it flows into rooms.\nWater recirculates via a channel back to the central fountain.\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n[12:00 - 12:05 – The Salsabil: Evaporative Cooling] (5 min)\nPurpose\nExplain how a simple water‑trickle panel (salsabil) uses evaporation to lower air temperature and boost humidity in sitting spaces.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer beside projected text or image of salsabil.\nMaterials needed: Projector with slide; pointer.\nPre‑activity checks: Verify bulleted text is clear and concise.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Our next heritage tactic is the salsabil—a decorative marble panel with wavy patterns.”\n“Water is poured at the top and flows down the angled grooves.”\n“As it trickles, evaporation cools the air and raises humidity, making the adjacent room feel more comfortable.”\n“After flowing down, the water collects in a channel and returns to the central fountain—creating a continuous loop.”\u000b\nKey Points\nEvaporation: Moving water converts heat to latent energy, cooling air.\nHumidification: Slightly higher humidity improves thermal comfort in dry climates.\nLow‑tech Recirculation: Simple gravity flow with no pumps required.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Yazd’s historic houses, salsabil panels can drop courtyard air by up to 3 °C on hot afternoons.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1 (2 min): Ask: “Where in your client’s home could you place a small salsabil to catch breezes?”\nStep 2 (2 min): One volunteer shares their placement idea.\nStep 3 (1 min): Trainer affirms and notes link back to “Evaporation” and “Humidity” principles.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants think it’s purely decorative.\nSolution: Emphasize its cooling function via evaporation.\nIssue: Concern about water maintenance.\nSolution: Suggest a small trickle pump or manual refill for continuous flow.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now we’ve covered three demos.

You see here the three pillars:\n🌍 Planet: we choose materials and systems to cut waste and carbon.\n👥 People: healthy air and comfortable spaces matter as much as efficiency.\n💰 Profit: lower bills and stronger resale value keep projects viable.\n\nIn Iraq, we’re already seeing this in action. The Baghdad Green Zone pedestrian lighting uses solar-powered fixtures, and Babylon’s Green University campus is LEED-certified—proof that theoretical benefits translate into real-world impact.\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Green building isn’t just “eco.” It balances environmental, social, and economic gains.\n2. Health and comfort drive user satisfaction—never overlook the people pillar.\n3. Financial returns (energy savings, higher valuation) win over even the toughest budget guard.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In Mosul’s reconstruction, small solar street-lights in public squares reduced generator use by 70 %—that’s planet + people + profit at work.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Turn to your neighbor and name one green-building item you’ve seen locally (1 min).\nStep 2: We’ll ask three pairs to share one quick example.

Why does the top floor of a Mosul home feel like an oven?”\u000b (Pause 1–2 suggestions.)\n“On screen are the three big drivers:\u000b • ☀️ Solar gain on the roof—intense sun bakes flat concrete.\u000b • 🏠 Poor roof insulation—bare tile conducts heat indoors.\u000b • 🌬️ Lack of stack‑vent cooling—no path for hot air to escape.”\n“Those combine to push temperatures well above comfort. Speaking of which, what do you consider a ‘comfortable’ indoor temperature? Official standards say 24 °C, but many people in Mosul only feel okay around 27 °C or higher.”\u000b\nKey Points\nSolar Gain: 3 000+ hours of sun per year heat roofs like frying pans.\nInsulation Gap: Concrete tile has low R‑value—heat floods inside.\nStack‑Vent Missing: Warm air pools at ceiling level without a chimney effect.\nComfort Threshold: Cultural norms shift comfort toward 27 °C in local homes.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In a recent study, flat‑roof homes in Mosul reached 60 °C at noon, while a well‑insulated heritage courtyard house stayed below 30 °C.”\n\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1 (30 s): Shout out any other drivers you’ve observed (e.g., dark roof paint, no overhang).\nStep 2 (30 s): Call out the comfort temperature you prefer at home—24, 27, or another number.\nStep 3 (3 min): Trainer collects a few responses and notes the range, then bridges to our next slide on First Principles.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants equate wind‑towers with fans.\nSolution: Emphasize this is about stack ventilation—passive air movement.\nIssue: Debate over comfort numbers.\nSolution: Acknowledge variation; stress we’ll learn how to meet both standards.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now that we’ve named the pain, let’s dive into the First Principles framework that underpins all the heritage tactics we’ll practice.”\n50\n\nMatch the Pain to Heritage Fix\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhich heritage design might help solves your client’s pain?\nRemember cost, reputation and style.\n🔥 Roof like oven        ⇆   \n💨 Dusty, stifling air    ⇆  \n💸 High generator bills  ⇆   \n📊 SPREADSHEET MOMENT \u000b open the Client Discovery tab\n[12:55 - 13:05 – Match the Pain to Heritage Fix] (10 min)\nPurpose\nHelp teams connect their client’s main comfort / cost pain to a relevant heritage tactic, and document that pain in the Comfort Challenges table of the Client Discovery sheet.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Slide displayed; teams at tables with notebooks or stickies.\nMaterials needed: Pens or stickies; Client Discovery sheet open on each laptop.\nPre‑activity checks: Confirm each team has access to their Client Discovery sheet.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“We’ve explored three heritage ‘hacks’: Courtyard Cooler, Wind‑Tower Vent, and Salsabil Water Panel.”\n“On this slide, you see three common pains:\u000b 🔥 Roof like oven\u000b 💨 Dusty, stifling air\u000b 💸 High generator bills.”\n“Pick the one pain that matches your client’s biggest complaint.

We’ll read each, give a concise answer, and then pause for one quick follow-up if needed.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Reinforce key rules (flash-round timing).  \n2. Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker: ΔT Showdown!”  \n68\n\nIce-Breaker – ΔT Showdown\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nΔT Showdown\n\nShout out the biggest temperature drop in Beit Turath Al Mosul you recorded yesterday (°C)!\n[09:35–09:45] – Ice-Breaker: ΔT Showdown (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\nBuild energy and reinforce Day 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding demo learnings by celebrating real ΔT results.\n\nSetup:\n• Participants remain in their teams.\n• Clear space in the center for “shout-out” action.\n\nMaterials needed:\n• Bell or buzzer.\n• Small snack prize for winning team.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n• Ensure each team has their ΔT reading accessible.\n• Confirm bell/buzzer is working.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Let’s see those ΔT numbers! On my count: 3–2–1… shout your highest temperature drop from yesterday’s demos. Ready? 3–2–1… GO!”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. **Accuracy matters:** Call out the number you measured.  \n2. **Speed counts:** First to shout gets the win.  \n3. **Celebrate data:** Reinforce the value of measuring performance.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In one of our pilot sessions, a team shouted ‘8 °C!’—that matched our courtyard case study and blew everyone away.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer counts down 3–2–1.  \n2. Teams shout their ΔT simultaneously.  \n3. Trainer rings bell for the quickest correct answer.  \n4. Award snack to that team; acknowledge the group’s results.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: Multiple teams shout same number at once.  \n  Solution: Ring bell and ask those teams to raise hands; pick one randomly.  \n• Issue: Incorrect ΔT shouted.  \n  Solution: Ask for a show of hands from teams with the actual reading; confirm before awarding.\n\nTransition ::\n“Great energy—let’s carry that momentum into our morning session but before that, let’s jump to daily agenda !”  \n69\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\n[09:45–09:50] – Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale.

On the left you see heavy materials—brick, stone, concrete—that store heat by day and release it slowly at night. On the right are lightweight insulators—foam boards, fiberglass, aerogel—that block heat transfer altogether.”\u000b (Point down each column.)\u000b “Thermal mass is ideal in climates with large day–night swings—like Mosul’s desert fringe—while insulation excels when you need a strong barrier against continuous sun.”\nKey Points ::\nThermal Mass: Dampens temperature swings by storing heat.\nInsulation: Resists heat flow, keeping interiors cooler continuously.\nTrade-off: Mass is heavy and slow to respond; insulation performs instantly but can degrade.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul, thick brick walls can reduce indoor highs by 4–6 °C after sunset, whereas under-roof insulation keeps afternoon peaks 2–3 °C lower.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPair up with a neighbor and choose one material from each column.\nDiscuss briefly (3 min) which you’d prioritize for Ahmed’s roof and why.\nShare one team’s choice and rationale with the full group (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nConfusing storage vs. blocking? → Ask, “Does this material hold heat so it’s released later, or stop it from coming in?”\nWondering about availability? → Prompt: “Which option can Ahmed source locally—brick or foam?”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent—keep those distinctions in mind. Next, we’ll quantify these effects with our Heat-Gain Demo: Glass vs Shade.”\n79\n\nHeat-Gain Demo: Acrylic “Glass” vs. Cardboard “Mashrabiya”\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nZone\nIR Temp (°C)\nA: Acrylic\n______\nB: Shade\n______\nΔT =\nA – B = __ °C\n“Every 1 °C reduction ≈ X Wh cooling saved”\n10:40–10:55 – Heat-Gain Demo: Glass vs. Shade (15 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Quantify how much extra solar heat a clear glass surface adds compared to traditional shaded treatments.\nSetup:\u000b • Place two sample zones side-by-side on the demo table under a desk lamp.\u000b • Participants remain seated in small groups around the table.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Clear acrylic panel (“glass”)\u000b • Cardboard mashrabiya model (“shade”)\u000b • Adjustable desk lamp\u000b • IR gun\u000b • Tape measure or ruler to set lamp height\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Position the lamp exactly 15 cm above both samples.\u000b • Warm up the IR gun and set to surface-temperature mode.\u000b • Confirm participants can see both zones clearly.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s put our material choices to the test. We have two zones: Zone A is clear acrylic, and Zone B is our cardboard mashrabiya shade. First, I’ll switch on the lamp and let both surfaces heat for 30 seconds—just enough for them to reach a steady state.”\u000b (Turn on lamp; wait 30 s.)\u000b “Okay, let’s record temperatures. Pair up: one of you points the IR gun; the other reads aloud.”\nDemo Steps:\nMeasure Zone A (glass) (1 min):\u000b “Aim at the surface, hold steady, and call out the temperature for Zone A.”\nMeasure Zone B (shade) (1 min):\u000b “Now switch to Zone B and record that reading.”\nCalculate ΔT (1 min):\u000b “On our slide table, write ΔT = Temp_A – Temp_B. That difference shows how much extra heat the glass traps.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\nSolar penalty: Glass traps more heat, raising surface temperature.\nShade benefit: Simple overhangs or lattice can cut ΔT significantly.\nEnergy link: Every 1 °C reduction equates to roughly X Wh of cooling energy saved.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our pilot workshop, glass surfaces heated to nearly 65 °C, while shaded models stayed around 50 °C—ΔT of 15 °C translates into hundreds of watts saved.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nLamp on for consistent heating (30 s).\nRecord Zone A temp (20 s).\nRecord Zone B temp (20 s).\nCompute and announce ΔT (40 s).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nLamp drifts: Tape its base or clamp it in place.\nIR gun misreads reflections: Aim slightly off-axis at a matte spot.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—now that you’ve seen the numbers, let’s shift to how you’ll source these solutions locally with our Supplier Ecosystem overview.”\n80\n\nSupplier Ecosystem Map\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMaterial\nSupplier Type\nExample Vendor\nLocation\nClay Bricks\nBrickworks\nGypsum Plaster\nGypsum Plant\nLimestone Blocks\nQuarry\nTimber Lattice\nCarpentry Workshop\nMashrabiya Screens\nWoodcarving Studio\nReflective Coatings\nPaint Supplier\n10:55–11:05 – Supplier Ecosystem Map (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show teams where and how to source every material and craft element they’ve just learned about.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the “Supplier Ecosystem Map” slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants seated with their notebooks open.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Printed list of local supplier contacts\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the table is fully visible and legible.\u000b • Ensure any printed contact lists are at the side table.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we know which materials and patterns we need, here’s how you actually get them. On screen is a snapshot of Mosul’s supplier ecosystem: brickworks, gypsum factories, quarries, woodcarvers, and paint vendors. Each row shows a material, the type of supplier, an example vendor, and their location.”\n(Point row by row.)\u000b “For example, Mosul Clay Co. in the Old City produces high-density clay bricks, while Al-Rashid Woodworks specializes in intricate lattice screens. You’ll build relationships with these local experts to ensure authenticity, quality, and faster lead times.”\nKey Points ::\nLocal sourcing reduces cost and supports the community.\nSpecialized craftspeople maintain heritage quality (e.g., mashrabiya carving).\nProximity matters: closer suppliers mean faster delivery and lower transport energy.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our pilot, teams who partnered with the Nineveh Gypsum Factory secured custom plaster mixes in half the usual lead time.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nChoose one material from your design and note its supplier type.\nWrite down the example vendor and their location in your notebook.\nDiscuss with your neighbor which supplier you’d contact first and why (3 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Uncertain which supplier fits a custom order.\u000b → Solution: Encourage calling the workshop; many will handle small bespoke runs.\nIssue: Vendor contact info missing.\u000b → Solution: Use the printed list or ask workshop staff for introductions.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent—now let’s take a 30-minute break.

You have 15 minutes to insert a 3 × 3 m courtyard into your 150 m² plan. Use your scale ruler (3 m = 3 cm at 1:100) to draw the void. Then sketch airflow arrows showing warm air exiting and cool air entering through the courtyard.\nLabel three zones (e.g., shaded seating, direct sun, breezeway). When time’s up, take a clear photo, name it TeamX_Courtyard.jpg, and upload it to our shared folder.”\nKey Points\nScale accuracy: 3 m must measure exactly 3 cm on your plan.\nAirflow clarity: Arrows must show direction of cool-in and warm-out.\nHeritage cue: Recall Day 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding’s courtyard demos when zoning functions.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Fatima’s retrofit courtyard was only 3 × 3 m but yielded a 7 °C drop indoors—small footprints can have big impact.”\nActivity Instructions\nConfirm materials at your table (1 min).\nStart sketching your courtyard and arrows (12 min).\nRefine labels in the last 2 min.\nPhotograph & upload before rotating (upload takes < 1 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nOver-detailing: If time is tight, focus on the courtyard and airflow arrows—skip shading patterns.\nScale mistakes: If your courtyard looks off, re-measure with your ruler before adding arrows.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great work—when the bell rings at 11:55, save your image and rotate to Station 2 (Cardboard + Fan Model) to see this airflow in action.

Hands Up!”\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\n[09:25–09:35] Ice-Breaker: “R or U? Hands Up!” (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Get everyone energized and cement the distinction between R-value (insulation) and U-value (conductance) before our deep dive.\nSetup:\u000b Participants remain in their seats or stand in a semi-circle. No materials required.\nMaterials needed:\u000b None.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b Ensure everyone can see the two icons on screen and understands “right = R, left = U.”\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Alright everyone, let’s play ‘R or U? Hands Up!’ I’ll read a quick statement about a material or scenario. If you think it’s about R-value (resisting heat), raise your right hand. If it’s about U-value (letting heat through), raise your left hand. Simple? Let’s test it!”\nStatements (call 6–8):\n“A thick wool blanket in winter.”\n“A single-pane glass window at midday.”\n“A dense cork under a roof slab.”\n“An uninsulated metal roof in July.”\n“A high-performance foam panel.”\n“A thin aluminum sheet.”\n(After each, pause 3 s to let hands go up, then “Right hands! Yes, wool blankets resist heat—R-value. Left hands on glass—U-value, lots of heat gain!”)\nKey Points\nR-value = Resist → right hand.\nU-value = Ugh leak → left hand.\nRapid, hands-up response builds instinct before the formal lesson.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nTrainer reads statement aloud.\nEveryone raises the corresponding hand (right = R, left = U).\nQuickly confirm the correct answer and move on to the next.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nDelayed response: Model one round at full speed, “ready–steady–go,” then ramp up.\nMixed hands: Pause and clarify the rule again—“Right hand for Resist, left for Conduct.”\u000b\nTransition: “Great form! Now let’s flow right into our Daily Agenda.”\n104\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\n[09:35 - 09:40] Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n105\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat. Use IR cameras & empathy maps to find and explain pain.\n2\nMaterials & Trust\nExplore what works for Mosul. Test courtyard ideas, meet suppliers, and pitch comfort ROI.\n3\nRoofs & Realistic Wins\nUse BIM to export roof data, call real suppliers, and build honest BOQs with price proof.\n4\nWalls, Windows & Wellness\nCompare costs and proof types. Fix BOQs, respond to objections, and share proof that works.\n5\nInnovation & Enterprise\nSimulate energy savings, finish your design pack, and give a pitch for system change.\n[09:40 - 09:45] Day 1-5 Overview (5 min)\n\nPurpose\u000b Give everyone a fast “big picture” of what we will learn, apply, and sell each day this week.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Participants stay seated, facing the projector.\nMaterials needed: Laptop + pointer / clicker; overview slide already on screen.\nPre-activity checks: Slide is readable from the back; pointer works; timer visible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Friends, before we jump into the details, let’s look at our week on one slide.\u000b You’ll see three columns—Learn, Apply, Sell—and five rows for Days 1-5.\u000b This table shows how each day moves from new knowledge, to hands-on practice, to skills you can pitch or sell.”\nKey Points\nDaily rhythm: We always start by learning the concept, then applying it, then selling the value.\nProgression: Skills build from simple (Day 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding) to advanced (Day 5).\nOutcome focus: Every day ends with something you can explain to a client or boss.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nPoint across one row as an example (e.g., Day 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding).\nHighlight how the three blocks link (“We learn about heat flow, test it with an IR gun, then frame it as savings for homeowners”).\nInvite participants to glance ahead and spot a block they’re excited about (10-second quick show of hands).\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Slide feels text-heavy.\u000b Solution: Use the pointer to focus on one cell at a time, speak slowly.\u000b\nIssue: Participants read instead of listen.\u000b Solution: Briefly dim screen after explanation to refocus on you.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—you now see the journey from Day 1 to day 5. Let’s we jump to Day 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة) learning objective.”\n106\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة) Learning Objectives\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nLearn\nTurn R‑value numbers into a money‑saving story clients grasp \nMaster BOQ basics & live area → volume → IQD conversion \nSpot glazing‑ratio “sweet spots” to balance daylight & heat\nApply\nFill the BOQ sheet with real wall data & verify formulas \nPractice real-world supplier calls and update the shared database\nSell\nProject “The Trust Test” and structuring and narrating the BOQ table\n[09:45–09:50] – Day 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة) Learning Objectives (5 min)\n\nPurpose : Preview how insulation math becomes a money-saving story clients understand.\n\nSetup Setup : :\nPhysical arrangement -- Seated, facing screen  \nMaterials needed -- Slide deck, pointer  \nPre-activity checks -- Conversion cheat-sheet on hand\n\nFacilitator Script Facilitator Script ::\n“Today we turn numbers into money: measure R-value, cost a wall fast, and pitch the best first step.”\n\nKey Points Key Points ::\n1. R-value is our ‘warmth number’  \n2. Quick math keeps quotes honest  \n3. Pitch shows which wall side matters most\n\nActivity Instructions Activity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Walk line-by-line through Learn column -- 1 min  \nStep 2: Ask class to recall yesterday’s ROI idea -- 30 s  \nStep 3: Link to today’s ‘Sun-Side First’ pitch -- 30 s\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions Common Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Math fear -- Solution: Remind calculator allowed  \nIssue: Slide too texty -- Solution: Use pointer spotlight\n\nTransition Transition : :\n“Let’s open the insulation toolbox and start with R-value 101.”\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\n108\n\n“The higher the R-value, the better the insulation quality is”\n“The lower the U-value of a material, the better its performance”\n\n\n\nR = m²·K/W  U = W / m²·K\nInsulation Metrics 101 – R & U\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n0.03 m thickness\nConvert cm → m before using the formula\n09:50–09:55 – Insulation Metrics 101: R & U (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Ground everyone in the core insulation metrics so material choices make sense.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Leave space on the whiteboard for our quick formula work.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Three cut-samples (foam, 3 cm cork, Isocam membrane) labeled with thickness in cm.\u000b • Excerpt of λ-value datasheet.\u000b • Whiteboard & marker.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm each sample shows its thickness in cm.\u000b • Verify the board is clear and marker works.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s start by defining two metrics you’ll use today: R-value tells us how well a material resists heat flow—the higher, the better. U-value is the inverse: it’s the rate of heat transfer per square meter per degree—so lower is better.\nYou’ll see on the slide:\nR = m²·K / W  U = W / m²·K\nAnd a quick reminder: Convert cm → m before using the formula—for example, that 3 cm cork sample is 0.03 m thick.”\u000b (Point to the “0.03 m thickness” icon.)\nKey Points ::\nR = thickness ÷ λ (units m²·K/W)\nU = 1 ÷ R (units W/m²·K)\nAlways convert your thickness into meters first.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul, a 3 cm cork panel (λ ≈ 0.04 W/m·K) gives R ≈ 0.75 m²·K/W—compare that to 1 cm foam (λ ≈ 0.025) which is only R ≈ 0.4.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPass the three samples down each row—feel thickness and spot differences.\nOn the whiteboard, write R = thickness / λ using meters (e.g., 0.03 m / 0.04). Calculate R together.\nInvert that R value to get U, and record it beside your formula.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nConfusing cm vs. m? → Always divide cm by 100 before plugging into R = thickness/λ.\nThinking higher U is better? → Remind: U measures leakiness—lower is more resistant.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—we can now quantify insulation performance. Next, let’s explore typical R-values in common building materials.”\n109\n\nR-Value Table - Common Building Materials\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:55–10:00] – R-Value Table (5 min)\nPurpose : Show the spectrum of insulation performance so teams can choose materials strategically.\nSetup : Project a clear table of 8–10 common materials and their R-values. Leave space on whiteboard for jotting examples.\nMaterials needed : Printed handout or projected slide of R-Value table (foam, cork, brick, concrete, wood, PIR, XPS, EPS).\nPre-activity checks : Ensure everyone can read the smallest font; confirm marker works for whiteboard notes.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Now that we know how to calculate R and U, let’s see real values for materials you’ll actually work with. This table shows R-value per material—higher resistivity means better insulation. Take a moment to scan through and think which ones fit Mosul’s climate and budget.”\nKey Points :\nLightweight foams and PIR/XPS panels have R ≈ 3–6 m²·K/W.\nTraditional materials (brick, stone) sit below R 1 m²·K/W.\nWood and cork are mid-range (R ≈ 1–2 m²·K/W) but offer heritage appeal.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “A 10 cm layer of expanded polystyrene (EPS) gives you around R 2.8—similar to a 15 cm thick traditional mashrabiya wall, but at half the thickness.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, pick two materials—one “high R” and one “low R”—and write their R-values on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 2: Debate which you’d specify for a sun-facing wall vs. an interior partition.\u000b Step 3: Volunteer teams share their choices (1 min each) and rationale.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing material thickness vs. R-value.\u000b Solution: Remind: table is already normalized to standard thickness. Focus on relative performance.\nIssue: Assuming “best R” always wins.\u000b Solution: Emphasize trade-offs: cost, heritage look, moisture risk.\nTransition :\u000b “Great discussion—next we’ll flip these R-values into U-values so you can compare whole assemblies.”\n110\n\nU-Value Table\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[10:00–10:05] – U-Value Table (5 min)\nPurpose : Reinforce the inverse relationship between resistance and conductance so teams grasp why U-value matters in real assemblies.\nSetup : Project the U-Value table slide and leave room on the whiteboard to jot sample calculations. Arrange participants so they can see both screen and board.\nMaterials needed : Projected slide of U-Value table; whiteboard and marker.\nPre-activity checks : Verify slide is legible from back row; confirm whiteboard marker writes clearly.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Here we flip R on its head: U-value tells us how much heat passes through per square meter per degree difference. Lower U means less heat gain. Take a moment to scan: you’ll notice traditional brick sits around U 0.8, while Thermostone is down at U 0.2—four times better.”\nKey Points :\nU = 1/R, so doubling R halves U.\nDense materials like concrete block have high U (≈1.3–1.5).\nSpecialty insulators (Thermostone) can achieve U <0.3 despite light weight.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 30 cm solid brick wall (U ≈0.85) will let roughly three times more heat inside than a 10 cm Thermostone panel (U ≈0.21).”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, choose two materials from the table—one high U and one low U—and calculate the ratio of their heat gains (e.g. 0.85 ÷ 0.21 ≈ 4).\u000b Step 2: Write your ratio and material names on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 3: One pair volunteers to explain why that ratio matters for selecting sun-facing walls.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing U and R units.\u000b Solution: Remind: R in m²·K/W resists heat; U in W/m²·K conducts heat. Higher U = more heat leak.\nIssue: Thinking density improves insulation.\u000b Solution: Emphasize: density affects thermal mass, not directly conduction—focus on U-values for insulation decisions.\nTransition :\u000b “Great insight—next, we’ll see these differences in action under our heat lamp and confirm the numbers with IR readings.”\n111\n\nLow solar gain, low daylight\nGlazing Ratios: Getting It Right\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Schematics of Façade A: 20% Glazing (small window area)\n*Schematics of Façade B: 40% Glazing (moderate window area)\n*Schematics of Façade C: 60% Glazing (large window area)\nBalanced daylight & thermal control\nHigh daylight, high cooling load\n10:05–10:15 – Glazing Ratios: Getting It Right (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Help teams choose appropriate window-to-wall ratios to balance daylighting benefits against cooling penalties.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain seated, sketchbooks or notebooks ready.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Handouts of a façade template for quick sketches\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the three façade graphics and percentages are clear from all seats.\u000b • Verify participants have a pen or pencil for sketching if desired.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Next, let’s tackle glazing ratios—the percentage of your wall that’s glass. Too little, and you lose daylight; too much, and you bake your interior. On screen are three examples:\n20% glazing gives minimal solar gain but also poor daylighting.\n40% glazing hits a balanced sweet spot—good light with manageable cooling loads.\n60% glazing floods the room with light but drives up air-conditioning use dramatically.\u000b In Mosul’s summer, we generally aim for 30–45% glazing to optimize both comfort and energy.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\nLow glazing (<25%) = low solar gain but dim interiors.\nModerate glazing (30–45%) = good daylight with tolerable heat gain.\nHigh glazing (>50%) = bright, but high cooling loads and glare.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our Mosul retrofit, a 40% glazing retrofit with shade fins dropped peak indoor temperatures by 3 °C compared to a previous 60% cut-and-paste glass façade.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nSketch on your notebook one façade with ~35% glazing (2 min).\nDiscuss with your neighbor: what shading detail would you add to that ratio? (3 min)\nVolunteer one idea to the group. (2 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nMisestimating percentages? → Use the façade template handout and lightly pencil shading to count grid squares.\nFocusing only on daylight? → Remind: “Every 1% glazing above 45% can add up to X W/m² of solar gain.”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—now that we know how to size our openings, let’s turn to our next slide: Building Trust Through Accuracy, where we’ll set clear cooling-load targets.”\n112\n\nPresent real numbers—accurate data earns client trust.\nBuilding Trust Through Accuracy\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nIntervention\nCooling Load (W/m²)\nTarget\nUnshaded concrete wall\n~300\n🚫 too high\nInsulated wall (10 cm EPS)\n~200\n✓ acceptable\nCourtyard-shaded wall or overhang\n~100\n★ ideal\n10:15–10:25 – Building Trust Through Accuracy (Cooling-Load Targets)\nPurpose:\u000b Show how setting clear cooling-load targets (in W/m²) and sharing them honestly with clients builds credibility and trust.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain at their seats with notebooks.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Printed “target sheet” for quick reference\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the table and icons are legible.\u000b • Ensure participants have a pen and can sketch if they wish.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we understand how to size our glazing and materials, let’s talk accuracy. Clients value real data. On screen are three representative cooling-load figures for Mosul:\nAn unshaded concrete wall runs around 300 W/m², which is prohibitive.\nAdding 10 cm of EPS insulation brings it down to 200 W/m², an acceptable level.\nA courtyard-shaded wall or well-designed overhang achieves 100 W/m², our ideal target.\u000b\nWhen you present these numbers clearly, you earn your client’s trust—because you’re honest about performance and realistic about outcomes.”\nKey Points ::\nQuantified targets: Share W/m² goals for each intervention.\nBenchmarking: Show “too high,” “acceptable,” and “ideal” zones.\nAccuracy = Trust: Clients respect data-driven transparency.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In a recent Mosul retrofit, we showed homeowners the simulated cooling loads: they switched from an initial 280 W/m² design to a courtyard solution hitting 95 W/m²—and signed the contract on the spot.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPair up and pick one intervention from the table.\nSketch (in words) how you’d explain its W/m² target to a client in under 15 seconds. (3 min)\nVolunteer one pair to deliver their client-brief tagline. (2 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nClients balk at numbers? → Frame in relatable terms: “That 100 W/m² is like running one 100 W bulb per square metre—can your generator keep up?”\nConfusion over units? → Remind: “W/m² is energy per area under full sun—bigger walls need more shading or insulation.”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent—now that we’ve anchored our accuracy theme, let’s head to the field with our Construction Site Observation Guide to see these targets in action on real building sites.”\n113\n\n🧱 Materials ▢\n(e.g. brick type, insulation panels, shading elements)\n\n🛠️ Methods ▢\n(e.g. masonry joint quality, installation sequencing)\n\nConstruction Site Observation Guide\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n10:25–10:35 – Construction Site Observation Guide (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\u000b Equip teams with a simple, repeatable checklist for observing real-world construction quality and processes on-site.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the “Construction Site Observation Guide” slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain seated with notebooks or tablets ready to note findings.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Notebook or tablet for each participant\u000b • (Optional) Printed one-page guide if preferred\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the four checklist items and icons are fully visible.\u000b • Ensure participants have pens or devices to record notes.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Before we head into our Design Studio, let me introduce our Construction Site Observation Guide. When you visit actual sites—be it a demolition, retrofit, or new build—you’ll use these four lenses:\nMaterials: Note types, quality, and condition—are bricks consistent? Is insulation stored properly?\nMethods: Observe how trades install elements—are joints even? Are shading devices placed correctly?\nWorkers: Watch skill levels and safety—are crews using PPE? Do they follow best practices?\nOrganization: Look at site logistics—are materials staged logically? Is waste managed?”\u000b\n(Point to each checkbox as you speak.)\nKey Points ::\nHolistic view: Good buildings start with good materials and methods.\nPeople matter: Skilled, organized crews deliver better outcomes.\nSite order: Efficient site organization reduces errors and waste.\u000b\nActivity Instructions ::\nReview each checklist category silently (1 min).\nDiscuss with your neighbor one thing you’ve seen in past projects under any category (3 min).\nWe’ll apply this guide tomorrow—be ready to fill in your own observations.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nOverwhelmed by detail? → Focus on one category at a time, rotating your attention every 30 seconds.\nMissing context? → Ask site supervisors “Why do you stage materials here?” to understand organization choices.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—keep that guide in mind. Next, we’ll simplify our digital workflow with Ladybug + Rhino Transparency, showing how open data and assumptions foster client trust.”\n114\n\nEDGE Energy Modeling Demo\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n10:35–10:45 – Ladybug + Rhino Transparency (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Demonstrate our transparent digital workflow, showing exactly how we move from model to data and share every assumption with clients.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the workflow slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain seated with sketchpads or notebooks.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the icons and labels are clear from all seats.\u000b • Verify you can draw quick annotations on a whiteboard if needed.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Here’s our simplified digital pipeline:\nWe start with Model Geometry in Rhino or Revit—defining your m² façades or m³ courtyards precisely.\nNext, we Assign Materials & Context, specifying λ-values, thickness in meters, and the Mosul climate file—no hidden defaults.\nWe Run Ladybug Analysis to simulate annual kWh loads.\nFinally, we Export & Share Data as a CSV—your client sees ΔkWh, W/m² results, even m³ airflow volumes.\u000b\nEvery assumption—from thickness to emissivity to weather file—is documented and available for review. That openness builds trust, because clients know exactly how you derived every number.”\nKey Points ::\nPrecision: Model inputs are in clear units (m, m², m³).\nOpenness: All material and climate assumptions are shared.\nTraceability: Each arrow in this flow is a checkpoint clients can inspect.\u000b\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Sketch this four-step flow in your notes, labeling each step in one line. (3 min)\nStep 2: Under each step, jot one assumption you’ll document (e.g., “0.03 m cork thickness”). (4 min)\nStep 3: Be ready to share one assumption you think clients will scrutinize most. (3 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nClients question assumptions? → Show them the CSV and climate file used.\nOverwhelmed by detail? → Emphasize the simplicity of the four-step flow—each step is transparent.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—keep those documentation notes handy. Next up is our Unit-Conversion Drill, where we’ll practice converting between m², m³, and piece counts for your BOQs.”\n115\n\nUnit-Conversion Drill\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nKeep your BOQs accurate with quick conversions\nConversion Type\nFormula\nExample\n📐 Area → Pieces\nm² ÷ tile_area (0.25 m²)\n10 m² ÷ 0.25 = 40 pieces\n📦 Volume → Area Coverage\nm³ × (1 / thickness (0.02 m))\n2 m³ × (1/0.02) = 100 m²\n🧱 Piece → Area\npieces × brick_area (0.1 m²)\n50 × 0.1 = 5 m²\nRemember: m² is square meters, m³ is cubic—never mix them up!\n10:45–10:55 – Unit-Conversion Drill (m² ↔ piece ↔ m³)\nPurpose:\u000b Ensure everyone can confidently convert between area, piece count, and volume—crucial for accurate BOQs and preserving our m²/m³ clarity.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen as reference.\u000b • Hand out the mini-worksheet with three practice problems.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Printed drill worksheets (with three problems).\u000b • Pens or pencils.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm each participant has a worksheet.\u000b • Verify the slide’s formulas and icons are legible.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “This drill reinforces our unit-clarity: square meters (m²), cubic meters (m³), and piece counts. You’ll see three common conversions on screen—each row uses a clear icon: 📐 for area, 📦 for volume, 🧱 for pieces. Now, solve the three problems on your worksheet. Then swap with a neighbor to check accuracy; small errors here can multiply into big BOQ mistakes.”\nKey Points ::\nPrecision: A mis-placed decimal in m² or m³ shifts material quantities.\nUnit-awareness: Always confirm whether you’re working in m² or m³.\nPeer-review: Double-check each other’s work to catch slip-ups early.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul, one team once ordered 25% too many bricks because they forgot the 0.1 m² brick area—and corrected it here before ordering.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nWork individually on Problems 1–3 (5 min).\nSwap worksheets and review your partner’s answers (3 min).\nCall out one corrected solution and write it on the board (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nConfusing m² vs. m³? → Emphasize the icon: 📐 is flat area, 📦 is volume.\nCalculation errors? → Encourage using scratch paper: break down each step.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent accuracy! Now take a 30-minute break—we’ll reconvene at 11:25 for our Apply block.”\n116\n\n🍴 LUNCH\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\n30 minutes\n117\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\n118\n\nBOQ and ROI Accuracy Practice\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n📂 Open the BOQ Builder workbook and click Tab 1: Line Items\n📝 Enter three retrofit items:\nInsulation (m²)\nShading device (lin. m or m²)\nLabour (hrs)\n➗ Input quantity, unit rate, and unit type for each\n🔢 Check that each line’s total = quantity × unit rate\n📊 Confirm the summary at the top updates correctly\n📊 SPREADSHEET MOMENT \u000b Open the BOQ Builder Tab in your workbook\n11:25–11:35 – BOQ Accuracy Practice (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Give teams hands-on practice entering and verifying BOQ line-items in Tab 1, so their quotes are accurate and transparent.\nSetup:\u000b • Participants at laptops with the BOQ Builder.xlsx file open.\u000b • Slide projected full-screen showing the five steps.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • BOQ Builder.xlsx on every laptop\u000b • Mouse and keyboard for data entry\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm everyone can open Tab 1: Line Items.\u000b • Verify the summary row is visible above the table.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now we replace simulations with BOQ accuracy—your clients need line-by-line clarity.

We’ll read each, give a concise answer, and then pause for one quick follow-up if needed.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Reinforce key rules (flash-round timing).  \n2. Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s we go to daily agenda.”  \n134\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\n[09:25–09:30] Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n135\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat.

On the left you see the Buyer’s Settlement Range—from their worst acceptable outcome up to their desired price. On the right is the Seller’s Settlement Range, from their worst case up to their ideal price.\nThe blue band in the middle is the ZOPA, or Zone of Possible Agreement—where buyer and seller ranges overlap. Any deal within that zone benefits both parties.\nYour job as negotiators is to strengthen your BATNA—your alternative if this deal fails—so your worst‑case line moves closer to your ideal, narrowing the seller’s leverage. Notice how shifting even a few hundred IQD per unit can expand or contract the ZOPA significantly.”\n\nKey Points\nBATNA = leverage. A better backup plan moves your worst‑case point upward (for buyers) or downward (for sellers).\nZOPA is the sweet spot. Aim to negotiate terms inside that overlap to ensure both sides feel they’ve gained.\nRange width matters. Narrower ranges make for tougher talks; broad ranges create more room to explore value‑adds beyond price.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\n(2 min) Walk through each labeled element on the slide: Buyer’s Worst Case → Buyer’s Desired Price → ZOPA → Seller’s Worst Case → Seller’s Desired Price.\n(5 min) Split into buyer/seller pairs. Each buyer states their BATNA and desired price for a mock 250 m² retrofit; seller states theirs. Identify the ZOPA.\n(3 min) Pairs share with the group: “Our ZOPA is between IQD X and IQD Y per m².”\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nConfusion over axes? → Re‑draw a simpler line‑chart on the board showing just two points and the overlap.\nBATNA unclear? → Ask, “What’s your Plan B if this buyer/seller walks away?”\nNo overlap (no ZOPA)? → Highlight importance of creative value‑adds or adjusting expectations to create a deal zone.\u000b\nTransition\n“Excellent—now that you can read and apply the BATNA diagram, let’s move on to the Negotiation Primer: BATNA & Qanaʿa, where we’ll combine these concepts with local principles of persuasion and trust.”\n139\n\nNegotiation Refresher – BATNA & Win‑Win\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nBATNA: Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement  \nWin‑Win: Seek mutual gain\nNumbers First: Ask price & MOQ before discussing terms\nPrep Tip: Know your target price and fallback option\n11 : 25 – 11 : 30 – Negotiation Refresher (5 min)\nPurpose\u000b Quickly review core negotiation principles so teams can secure better deals during supplier calls and role‑play.\nSetup\nProject the Negotiation Refresher slide.\nEnsure each team has a whiteboard or flip‑chart to jot their BATNA and target price.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nFlip‑chart or small whiteboard per team.\nMarkers.\u000b\nPre‑activity Checks\nConfirm teams can see the slide.\nProvide each team a marker and surface to write on.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s pause for a 5‑minute refresher on three key tactics:\nBATNA — Your Best Alternative if this deal falls through. Always know your fallback.\nWin‑Win — Frame the negotiation so both sides gain value, building long‑term relationships.\nNumbers First — Lead with clear questions on price, MOQ, and lead‑time before discussing extras.\nTake 1 minute to write down your BATNA and your target price on your board. I’ll walk around to check your numbers.”\nKey Points\nA strong BATNA gives you leverage—don’t negotiate blind.\nAim for mutual benefit to keep suppliers engaged.\nStart with numbers to anchor the conversation.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\n(1 min) Teams note their BATNA and target price.\n(2 min) Share one team’s BATNA aloud for group feedback.\n(2 min) Quick Q&A: “What challenges do you foresee?”—facilitator clarifies.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nTeams unclear on BATNA? → Explain: “If this supplier won’t meet your price, what’s your next option?”\nToo much theory? → Keep examples concrete: “Your fallback might be a local mason offering bundling discounts.”\n140\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nNegotiation Primer: BATNA & Qanaʿa\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nPair up, switch roles, then debrief on which phrases felt most persuasive.\nRole A: Contractor\nRole B: Client\n• Pitch one BOQ option (Good/Better/Best) with your rate.\n• Respond with a request to lower cost by ~10%.\n• State your BATNA if deal falls through.\n• Use a Qanaʿa phrase: “I want this to feel fair for both.”\n• Anchor ~10% above your ideal target.\n• Listen actively & push back once before conceding.\n11:25 – 11:55 | Negotiation Role-Play (30 min)\nPurpose :\u000b Give learners hands-on practice using BATNA, Qanaʿa, and anchoring in a live negotiation scenario.\nSetup :\u000b • Participants remain in pairs.\u000b • Slide projected full-screen.\nMaterials needed :\u000b • Projector & clicker\u000b • Flip-chart & markers for debrief notes\nPre-activity checks :\u000b • Ensure each pair can see the table of instructions.\u000b • Confirm flip-chart is ready to capture key phrases.\n\nFacilitator Script :\n“Now it’s your turn to negotiate—live!”\n“On the left is Role A: Contractor—you’ll pitch one of your BOQ options, state your BATNA, and anchor about 10% above your ideal price.”\n“On the right is Role B: Client—you’ll ask for a roughly 10% discount, use a Qanaʿa phrase like ‘I want this to feel fair for both of us,’ and listen actively.”\n“You have 5 minutes for the first round. Then swap roles for another 5 minutes.”\n“After both rounds, we’ll spend 5 minutes debriefing key phrases and how each tool felt in practice.”\n\nKey Points :\nBATNA gives you confidence—state your fallback clearly.\nQanaʿa builds rapport—express fairness explicitly.\nAnchoring sets negotiation range—start high to allow concession.\u000b\nLocal example :\u000b “In Mosul, contractors who showed their alternative clients (BATNA) while offering phased payments (Qanaʿa) closed deals 30% faster.”\n\nActivity Instructions :\nStep 1 (5 min): Role A and Role B negotiate per the table.\nStep 2 (swap, 5 min): Switch roles and repeat.\nStep 3 (debrief, 5 min): Two volunteers share which phrase (BATNA, Qanaʿa, or anchor) felt most persuasive.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Participants skip using BATNA.\u000b Solution: Prompt: “What’s your backup if this deal doesn’t go through?”\nIssue: Qanaʿa phrase feels forced.\u000b Solution: Suggest simpler fairness wording: “Let’s find a win-win.”\n\nTransition :\u000b “Great work!

We’ll read each, give a concise answer, and then pause for one quick follow-up if needed.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Reinforce key rules (flash-round timing).  \n2. Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker:!”  \n161\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n[09:20 – 09:25] Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context.

With just two small grants, she and her team restored two of the four historic qunatra, reviving stone arches and community pride against all odds.”\n  “Next is Wifaq—a civil engineer who applied a simple, heritage-inspired cork render to his family’s home. He measured a **17 °C drop** indoors—enough that his children moved off the blistering rooftop and back upstairs, and that generator fuel bills fell sharply.”\n  “Finally, Laith always says, ‘Trust is our currency in Mosul.’ By delivering one exceptional heritage retrofit, he earns ten new referrals—proving that empathy and technical rigor travel hand-in-hand.”\n  “By the end of this week, you’ll have the tools to slash heat, boost comfort, and build trust—just like Fatima, Wifaq, and Laith.”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. Local Leadership: Small, community-driven projects can transform public space (Fatima).  \n  2. Tangible Results: Simple materials deliver measurable comfort gains (Wifaq).  \n  3. Emotional ROI: Empathy-driven quality work multiplies referrals (Laith).\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In 2024, another Mosul engineer applied that same cork render in a school—students reported falling asleep more comfortably during lessons.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Listen to each story (2 min).  \n  Step 2: Reflect silently: Which story resonates most with you? (1 min)  \n  Step 3: Turn to a neighbor and share your pick in one sentence. (3 min)  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: Stories feel abstract.  \n    Solution: Prompt: “Imagine living in that home—what difference would 17 °C make for your family?”  \n  Issue: Pair-shares go off-topic.  \n    Solution: Refocus: “Name the one lesson you’d take from this story.”\n\nTransition ::\n  “With those examples in mind, let’s dive into our pre-assessment and see where we all stand before we begin the training.”  \n\n\nDesign Studio Setup & Safety\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWorkstations Ready\nOpen your Revit/Rhino model & Courtyard-ROI.xlsx\nPower & Backup\nPlug in chargers 🔋\nSave frequently to TeamX_DesignStudio.*\nFile Naming\nUse TeamX_SunWall.rvt, TeamX_ROI.xlsx, TeamX_SectionSketch.png\nTiming\n70 min total → bell signals rotation\nSafety First\nTidy cables → no trips 🧹\nProtect laptops from spills ☕\n[11:20 – 11:25] APPLY Intro – Design Studio Tasks & Safety (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Orient teams to the digital‐studio workflow, tools, and safety/file‐management rules before the hands-on session.\nSetup:\nParticipants at laptop stations, models & Excel file open.\nSlide projected full-screen with key reminders.\u000b\nMaterials Needed:\nRevit/Rhino sample file & Courtyard-ROI.xlsx on each laptop\nPower strips and extension cords\nPre-printed quick-reference card with file-naming convention\u000b\nPre-activity Checks:\nConfirm all laptops are plugged in and charging.\nVerify that each team can open the model and ROI file.\nEnsure network or shared-drive access is working for saves.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Welcome to our Design Studio!

Use the template on your table, pick a color for each layer—insulation, structure, waterproofing, finish—and label the R or U-value in the legend. This visual will help clients immediately grasp how your design achieves comfort.”\nKey Points:\nClarity: Distinct colors help distinguish layers at a glance.\nData: Including R/U-values ties visuals back to performance.\nConsistency: Match colors to your BOQ materials for coherence.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In one project, teams used green for bio-insulation and gray for concrete; clients loved the instant “map” of comfort zones.”\nActivity Instructions:\nChoose your four colors and assign each to a material layer. (2 min)\nSketch the layers on the template and fill in the legend with values. (6 min)\nTake a photo of your finished sketch and upload it. (2 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Colors too similar.\u000b Solution: Pick high-contrast markers or add pattern fills.\nIssue: Forgetting to label values.\u000b Solution: Check your BOQ’s material R/U-values before you start.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great work—now let’s convert between area, piece, and volume in our final drill.”\n196\n\nStep 6 – Mind-Map Node Update\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMind-Map Refresh\nAdd new nodes for today’s insights:\nΔT savings 💧\nMaterial cost vs performance 💰\nDigital modeling benefits 💻\nUse a sticky note and place it on the mind-map board\nCluster related ideas under “Thermal,” “Cost,” or “Design”\nTime: 12:25 – 12:30 (5 min)\u000b Session: Step 6 – Mind-Map Node Update\nPurpose:\u000b Capture fresh insights from the Design Studio so our collective mind-map stays current and reflects today’s thermal, financial, and digital wins.\nSetup:\nBring teams back to the mind-map wall or canvas.\nProvide a supply of sticky notes and pens nearby.\nDisplay the prompt slide for reference.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nSticky notes (various colors)\nPens or markers\nExisting mind-map chart on wall\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nEnsure mind-map area is clear for new notes.\nConfirm each team has at least one sticky note and pen.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “We’ve gathered a lot of data today—ΔT savings, BOQ numbers, and even our first digital modeling steps. Now let’s refresh our collective mind-map. On a sticky note, jot one new insight from your studio work under Thermal, Cost, or Design. Then place it on the board in the matching cluster.”\nKey Points:\nConciseness: One insight per note keeps the map readable.\nCategorization: Align each note to Thermal, Cost, or Design for clarity.\nEngagement: Everyone’s contribution enriches the group’s knowledge.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In yesterday’s session, a team added ‘8 °C ΔT → 36 000 IQD/mo saved’ under Thermal—and that note sparked our follow-up on payback.”\nActivity Instructions:\nWrite one key insight from your Design Studio work on a sticky note. (2 min)\nPlace it on the mind‐map under the correct category. (2 min)\nStep back and take a quick look at newly added nodes. (1 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Sticky note text too long.\u000b Solution: Remind: “Keep it to a short phrase or number.”\u000b\nIssue: Misplaced notes.\u000b Solution: Prompt: “Which cluster—Thermal, Cost, or Design? Let’s place it there.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great map update! Now let’s move into our Sell block, where you’ll pitch your sun-wall ROI and digital approach.”\n197\n\nFrom BOQ → Comparative ROI\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n⚡ kWh Saved → 💰 IQD / year\nA[ΔT → kWh Savings] --> B[kWh × Tariff (500 IQD/kWh)]\n    B --> C[Annual IQD Savings]\nEnter your kWh savings in the ROI sheet\u000b\nUse local tariff of 500 IQD/kWh\u000b\nSee your annual cost savings update instantly\n[10:20 – 10:25] From BOQ → Comparative ROI (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show how energy reductions from your BOQ translate into real money saved per year, reinforcing the business value of passive design.\nSetup:\nProject the slide with the simple conversion diagram.\nPull up the team’s ROI Excel with kWh input cell highlighted.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nProjector & clicker\nSample ROI spreadsheet open\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify the tariff cell is set to 500 IQD/kWh.\nConfirm the annual savings formula (=kWh_savings * tariff * 24 h * 365 days) is correct.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now that you have your BOQ costs, let’s connect the dots to energy savings. In cell B4, enter your kWh savings from the Ladybug sim. Multiply that by our local rate—500 IQD per kWh—and you get the annual cost savings. That’s the ROI your clients will care about most: real IQD back in their pocket each year.”\nKey Points:\nTariff toggle: Always use the current local rate (⚡→💰).\nAnnualized view: Multiply daily or seasonal kWh by 365 for yearly impact.\nClient story: Framing savings per year makes budgets and pay-back clear.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, a 2 kWh/day reduction translates into about 365 kWh/year × 500 IQD = 182 500 IQD saved annually—enough to cover a month’s groceries.”\nActivity Instructions:\nI’ll demo entering 2 kWh in B4 and show the 182 500 IQD update (1 min).\nEach team enters their own kWh savings figure (2 min).\nVerify your annual savings number appears correctly (2 min).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nWrong tariff: Remind teams to check the tariff cell before multiplying.\nFormula error: Ensure the annualization factor (× 365) is included in the formula.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great—your cost story is taking shape.

First, we draw a 3 × 3 m wall—area of 9 m². Next, multiply by your planned thickness—0.2 m—so volume is 1.8 m³. Then enter your rate, say 80 000 IQD per cubic meter. Watch: the Sub-total column automatically shows 144 000 IQD. No extra calculator needed—your spreadsheet does the heavy lifting!”\nKey Points:\nArea → Volume: Always multiply area by thickness for volume.\nRate consistency: Use the same unit rate (IQD/m³).\nAuto-calc: Set formulas once—then data entry drives results.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In our Mosul pilot, one team’s 1.8 m³ of mashrabiya screen at 80 000 IQD/m³ cost just 144 000 IQD—easy for clients to compare against their generator bills.”\nActivity Instructions:\nI’ll demo on screen while teams watch (2 min).\nNow over to you: each team picks one BOQ line, draws the area, enters thickness and rate (5 min).\nConfirm your sub-total matches the live demo example (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nFormula errors: Check that your Sub-total cell uses =Rate*Qty.\nUnit mix-ups: Verify you’re using m³ rates for volumetric items, not m² rates.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent—now you’ve seen how BOQ and math tie together. Next, we’ll move into LEARN-2: From BOQ → Comparative ROI, where we’ll turn these costs into savings narratives.”\n200\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nEmbodied Energy Flash\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nTotal energy used from material extraction through construction\n\n\n✅ Pro: Local materials ↓ transport emissions\n⚠️ Con: Specialty panels ↑ upfront carbon footprint\n[10:25 – 10:30] Embodied-Energy Flash (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Raise awareness of the hidden energy cost in building materials to inform more sustainable BOQ choices.\nSetup:\nTrainer stands beside screen displaying the slide.\nNo additional handouts required.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nProjector & clicker\nSlide queued and visible\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nConfirm the “Embodied Energy” icon renders correctly.\nEnsure slide text is legible from back row.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Let’s zoom out from operational energy and look at embodied energy—the total energy invested before a building even operates, from quarry to onsite assembly. In one sentence: embodied energy sums all the upstream energy in your materials.”\n“Notice the trade-offs: using local stone slashes transport emissions, but specialty high-performance panels can carry a higher upfront carbon footprint despite their operational benefits.”\n\nKey Points:\nLifecycle View: Assess both upfront (embodied) and ongoing (operational) energy.\nMaterial Choice: Local vs. exotic materials each have pros and cons.\nBalanced Design: Aim for materials with moderate embodied energy and strong thermal performance.\n\nActivity Instructions:\nThink of one material on your BOQ—estimate whether it has high or low embodied energy.\nShare your pick in one sentence with the person next to you (2 min).\nWe’ll ask two volunteers to share back (1 min).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Confusing embodied vs. operational energy.\u000b Solution: Clarify “embodied = before use; operational = during use.”\nIssue: No volunteer insights.\u000b Solution: Prompt: “Name a material you see on site — likely high or low embodied energy?”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great insights!

Ask: ‘What’s your current per-unit price and delivery timeline?’ Jot their answer on your BOQ.\u000b Now, let’s compare how that real price will slot into a slick PDF you email versus a crisp printed deck you hand over. Notice how on-screen you can embed links; in print you simplify footers, boost chart contrast, and leave space for signatures.”\nKey Points:\nReal numbers: Live supplier rates beat guesswork.\nVisual hierarchy: Large headings & call-outs guide the reader.\nFormat fit: PDFs can link; print must stand alone.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In last month’s Mosul pilot, teams who called suppliers on the spot cut their quoting time in half—and proposals felt far more credible.”\nActivity Instructions:\n📞 Supplier call (2 min): Dial, confirm price + lead time, record on your BOQ.\n🖥 PDF scan (2 min): Note one element to add/remove for clarity.\n📄 Print check (2 min): Highlight a contrast/layout tweak on the handout.\n🔄 Pair-share (2 min): Swap insights with a neighbor.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: No answer on first ring. → Solution: Leave a quick voicemail: “Please text your per-unit cost for our quote.”\nIssue: Supplier price seems off. → Solution: Ask, “Does that include delivery?” and adjust BOQ accordingly.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great insights and real prices in hand—let’s take a 30-minute break and come back ready to apply these to our afternoon design studio.”\n202\n\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nTask 2 – Run Ladybug Simulation → kWh Saved\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🔨 Input Model\nEnsure “Sun‐Wall” layer is ON\nSet weather file: Mosul_HOURLY.epw\n\n▶️ Run Simulation\nLaunch Ladybug → Annual Energy → Cooling kWh\n\n📊 Export Results\nNote “Cooling Load (kWh)” for baseline vs retrofit\n\n💾 Save Output\nScreenshot graph → Team#_Ladybug_kWh.png\n[11:40–11:55] – Task 2: Run Ladybug Simulation → kWh Saved (15 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quantify annual cooling energy savings from your sun‐wall model by running a Ladybug simulation.\n\nSetup:\n  • Teams at digital-studio workstations with their refined 50 m² sun-wall model loaded.  \n  • Trainer computer mirroring one sample simulation to the screen.\n\nMaterials needed:\n  • Rhino/Grasshopper with Ladybug plugin.  \n  • Mosul weather file (Mosul_HOURLY.epw).  \n  • Screenshot tool.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Verify each team’s model has the courtyard layer toggled correctly.  \n  • Confirm the Ladybug plugin is installed and visible.  \n  • Ensure the weather file is loaded in each Grasshopper definition.\n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “First, toggle your ‘Sun-Wall’ model and load the Mosul_HOURLY.epw weather file into Ladybug’s Energy simulation component.”  \n  2. “Click ‘Run Annual Simulation’ and wait for the cooling-load report—this will take 1–2 minutes.”  \n  3. “Once complete, find the summary panel showing Cooling Load in kWh per year. Note both the baseline and retrofit values.”  \n  4. “Take a clean screenshot of that summary graph and save it as `Team#_Ladybug_kWh.png`.”\n\nKey Points:\n  1. Model Accuracy: The simulation only reflects what’s visible—double-check your layers.  \n  2. Consistent Weather: Always use the same Mosul_HOURLY.epw file for comparability.  \n  3. Clear Export: The screenshot is your proof of kWh savings—make sure axes and legends are visible.\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Load model & weather file (2 min).  \n  2.

Notice how quantities may be in m², m³, or piece.”  \n  2. “For each line, convert your area → volume using the formula on the slide, then enter the corresponding unit price.”  \n  3. “Watch your Subtotal column auto-populate—this is your material cost per item.”  \n  4. “Complete all key retrofit items: walls, shading screens, renders, and any extras you’ve designed.”  \n\nKey Points:\n  1. Unit consistency: Always match your quantity to the declared unit (e.g., m³ for volumes).  \n  2. Accurate pricing: Use our handout’s latest rates to avoid cost overruns.  \n  3. Formula check: Ensure your spreadsheet formulas are correct—Qty × UnitPrice = Subtotal.  \n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Convert each design element from your model into a BOQ line.  \n  2. Apply unit conversions (area→volume) where needed.  \n  3. Enter unit prices and verify each Subtotal.  \n  4. Sum all Subtotals to get your project’s total material cost.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Mismatched units: If area shows in m² but price is per m³, pause and recalculate volume first.  \n  • Missing prices: Flag any absent rate—use the average from the handout as a placeholder.  \n  • Formula errors: If the Subtotal isn’t populating, check that the cell references match your Qty and Unit Price cells.  \n\nTransition:\n  “Great work—now that you have your full BOQ, let’s convert those energy savings into real IQD figures on our Auto-ROI sheet in Task 4.”  \n204\n\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nTask 4: Auto-ROI Sheet → Yearly IQD\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🧮 Formula Flow\nΔHeat Gain (W/m²) → ΔEnergy (kWh/yr)\nΔEnergy × Tariff (IQD/kWh) = Annual Savings (IQD/yr)\nΔW/m²\nArea (m²)\nΔkWh/yr\nTariff (IQD/kWh)\nSavings (IQD/yr)\n200\n50\n(200×50×24×365)/1000 ≈ 87 600\n500\n43,800,000\n2. 📊 Example Snippet\n💡 Tip: Link your Ladybug kWh output directly into cell B2 for live recalculation\n[12:20–12:30] – Task 4: Auto-ROI Sheet → Yearly IQD (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Convert your simulated energy savings into concrete IQD values to strengthen your financial proposal.\n\nSetup:\n  • Teams remain at laptops with the Auto-ROI spreadsheet open.  \n  • Projector displays the formula snippet slide for reference.  \n\nMaterials needed:\n  • Auto-ROI Excel/Google Sheet with formulas.  \n  • Your Ladybug simulation kWh summary.  \n  • Local tariff handout (IQD/kWh).  \n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm each team’s sheet has ΔkWh/yr and tariff input cells ready.  \n  • Verify tariff value matches today’s market rate (e.g., 500 IQD/kWh).  \n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “On the slide you see how we map ΔW/m² → ΔkWh/year using your Ladybug output. Multiply by your façade area and divide by 1 000 to get annual kWh.”  \n  2. “Next, enter the local energy tariff in IQD per kWh—your sheet will auto-calculate the IQD savings per year.”  \n  3. “This number is essential: it shows clients exactly how much their retrofit saves them on fuel or electricity bills every year.”  \n\nKey Points:\n  1. Direct linkage: Pull your simulation ΔkWh/yr straight into the ROI cell.  \n  2. Live recalculation: Changing the tariff or area instantly updates IQD savings.  \n  3. Clarity: This annual figure anchors your “Ask” in the hook pitch.  \n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Copy your Ladybug ΔkWh/yr into the sheet’s “Energy Savings” cell.  \n  2. Confirm or adjust the tariff cell to today’s IQD/kWh.  \n  3. Review the “Annual Savings” output and note it for your proposal.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Formula error: If savings don’t appear, check that ΔkWh and tariff cells are formatted as numbers.  \n  • Tariff mismatch: If the figure seems too low/high, re-verify the tariff with the handout.  \n\nTransition:\n  “Excellent—now capture that Savings cell and your BOQ table as high-res visuals. In Task 5, you’ll embed them into your proposal deck along with your model screenshot.”  \n205\n\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nIntro & File-Naming\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🖼️ Gallery Placeholder\n Insert photo: Team#_Ladybug_kWh.png\n Insert screenshot: Team#_SunWallModel.png\n Insert BOQ & ROI visuals: Team#_BOQ.png, Team#_ROI.png\n📁 Filename Conventions\nUse Team<Number>_<ContentType>.<ext>\n\nExamples:\nTeam2_Ladybug_kWh.png\nTeam2_CourtyardROI.png\nTeam2_ProposalDeck.png\n💡 Tip: Export all images ≥ 300 dpi for crisp print and screen sharing.\n[12:30–12:40] – Task 5: Capture High-Res Photos & BIM Screenshot (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Prepare professional-quality visuals for your proposal deck, ensuring clarity and impact.\n\nSetup:\n  • Teams open their proposal deck template on laptops.  \n  • Slide projected shows placeholders and naming conventions.  \n\nMaterials needed:\n  • Your saved image files (Ladybug graphs, model views, BOQ/ROI snapshots).  \n  • Deck template with image frames ready.  \n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm each team’s images are exported at ≥ 300 dpi.  \n  • Verify deck template frames are unlocked and sized correctly.  \n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “Now you’ll drag your high-res images into the gallery placeholders in your proposal deck.”  \n  2. “Follow the filename convention `Team#_<Content>.<ext>` so we can track and share easily.”  \n  3. “Make sure each image fills its frame without distortion—right-click → ‘Fit to Frame’ if needed.”  \n\nKey Points:\n  1. Consistency: Uniform naming helps us collate all teams’ assets later.  \n  2. Quality: 300 dpi ensures sharp visuals both on screen and in print.  \n  3. Placement: Use the deck’s built-in frames to maintain layout alignment.  \n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Locate your “kWh Savings” graph and drag into first placeholder (2 min).  \n  2. Insert your Sun-Wall model screenshot into second frame (2 min).  \n  3. Add your BOQ and ROI snapshots into the gallery (4 min).  \n  4.
