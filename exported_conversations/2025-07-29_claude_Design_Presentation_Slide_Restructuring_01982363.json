  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is developing a 5-day training program on green architecture and heritage-inspired design for Mosul and requested help restructuring their existing slides to align with a new approach. They shifted from a values-based framework using Arabic principles (العلم for knowledge, الجمال والمنفعة for beauty and benefit, etc.) to a more technical, component-focused structure covering first principles, materials and trust, roofs and realistic wins, walls/windows and wellness, and innovation and enterprise. The user provided their current slide structure and asked for minimum-maximum changes needed to realign the content.\n\nClaude analyzed the existing comprehensive training module and proposed a new 5-day overview table with Learn/Apply/Sell columns for each day, maintaining the technical content while reframing the narrative from values-driven to component-driven learning. The recommendations included minimum changes like updating day headers and learning objectives, and maximum changes involving restructuring Day 2 to emphasize materials and supplier relationships, adding component-specific visual icons, and creating a technical progression from foundations through complete systems. Claude suggested keeping 90% of existing content including exercises and tools while repackaging the approach, noting that the content already covered the building components and just needed narrative restructuring. The user's training appears to focus on practical applications like IR camera thermal scanning, BIM to BOQ workflows, supplier verification, and ROI calculations for green building solutions in Mosul's climate.",

You’ll see four QR codes on the screen—each links to a different program.”\u000b “Feel free to scan now or later; you can register directly from your phone.”\nKey Points\nOptions: Four distinct BEIT tracks available.\nConvenience: Instant sign‑up via QR code.\nNext steps: No pressure—this is optional.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“A colleague attended our Energy‑Efficiency bootcamp via QR signup and implemented passive cooling in three local homes.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1: Invite participants to scan any code that interests them (2 min).\nStep 2: Trainer circulates to answer questions about each program (2 min).\nStep 3: Ask for a thumbs‑up when ready to proceed (1 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: QR code won’t scan.\nSolution: Provide short URL posted in chat or on flipchart.\nIssue: Participants without smartphones.\nSolution: Collect names and send links via email after the session.\u000b\nTransition\n“Thanks for exploring additional options. Now, let’s get into today’s schedule with our Daily Agenda and 3‑Block Rhythm.”\n3\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n[09:15–09:20] – Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, LEARN—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, APPLY—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, SELL—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. Structure: Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. Engagement: Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. Progress: Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: Participants lose sight of the agenda  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: Time-keeping slips\n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n4\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding first principles\nLearn why modern home designs have difficulties for Mosul’s environment and how green/heritage designs solve them.\u000bUse IR cameras & empathy maps to find and explain pain.\n2\nMaterials & Trust\nExplore what works for Mosul. Test courtyard ideas, meet suppliers, and pitch comfort ROI.\n3\nRoofs & Realistic Wins\nUse BIM to export roof data, call real suppliers, and build honest BOQs with price proof.\n4\nWalls, Windows & Wellness\nCompare costs and proof types. Fix BOQs, respond to objections, and share proof that works.\n5\nInnovation & Enterprise\nSimulate energy savings, finish your design pack, and give a pitch for system change.\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:20 – 09:25 Day 1‑5 Overview] (5 min)\nPurpose\nGive participants a clear “big‑picture” of the week’s Learn → Apply → Sell rhythm across five days.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Participants seated, facing the screen.\nMaterials needed: Projector, pointer or clicker, overview slide loaded.\nPre‑activity checks: Slide legible from the back; pointer works; timer visible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s step back and see our week at a glance. On this table, each row is a day—Day 1 through Day 5—and each column is one of our three blocks: Learn, Apply, and Sell.”\u000b “Day 1 we focus on first principles: you’ll learn why modern designs struggle here, apply heritage tactics with IR guns and empathy maps, then sell your pain‑to‑price insight. Day 2 deepens Materials & Trust; Day 3 roofs and price‑proof BOQs; Day 4 walls, windows, and handling objections; and Day 5 is our full Innovation & Enterprise sprint and final pitch.”\nKey Points\nDaily Rhythm: Each day is structured Learn → Apply → Sell.\nSkill Progression: We move from foundational concepts to advanced enterprise-level pitching.\nOutcome Focus: Every afternoon Sell block gives you a tangible deliverable or pitch.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1: Point with the pointer across one example row (e.g., Day 1).\nStep 2: Briefly describe each block in that row (Learn – theory; Apply – hands‑on; Sell – pitch).\nStep 3: Ask participants to raise a finger for the day/block they’re most excited about (10 s).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Slide feels text‑heavy.\nSolution: Focus on one row or column at a time; keep your explanation brief.\nIssue: Participants read ahead instead of listening.\nSolution: Dim the slide briefly after each row to draw attention back to you.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—you now know where we’re headed. Let’s dive into Day 1’s first Learn block: understanding first principles of comfort and heritage design.”\n5\n\nDay 1\nخيرُ الناسِ أنفعُهم للناسِ\n“The best of people are those that are of the most benefit to people.\nHadith Prophet Muhammed (S)\n[09:00 - 09:05 – Opening & Welcome] (5 min)\nPurpose\nTo warmly welcome participants, set a positive tone, and introduce the trainer.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer stands center front; participants seated facing screen.\nMaterials needed: Projector with slide loaded.\nPre‑activity checks: Confirm slide displays correctly; microphone/audio working.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Green Architecture & Heritage‑Inspired Design workshop. I’m [Trainer Name], and I’ll be guiding you over the next five days as we explore how traditional wisdom can solve today’s housing challenges.”\u000b “Let me start with a thought from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):”\u000b (Read slide)\n“The best of people are those that are of the most benefit to people.”\u000b “This workshop is built on that principle—our goal is to empower you to create designs that truly benefit communities.”\nKey Points\nWelcome: Establish friendly, inclusive atmosphere.\nIntroductions: Trainer name and role.\nTheme: Service and benefit as guiding value.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Last year in Mosul, a small courtyard retrofit saved a family over 30 % on fuel costs—showing how simple design can deliver big benefits.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1: Trainer briefly waves to make eye contact (30 s).\nStep 2: Ask participants to nod if they’re excited to learn (1 min).\nStep 3: Encourage any quick questions before moving on (3 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants chatting quietly.\nSolution: Pause and say, “Let’s all focus on the screen for a moment.”\nIssue: Audio distortion on slide quote.\nSolution: Repeat the quote clearly, or switch off the slide and speak directly.\u000b\nTransition\n“Thank you. Now that we’ve set our shared purpose, let’s dive into our first topic: What is the BEIT project?”\n6\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nIce Breakers\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nWhy did you become an architect?\n(get into pairs and share)\n[09:50 - 10:00 – Ice Breakers: “Why Are You an Architect?”] (10 min)\nPurpose\nBuild rapport, energize the group, and surface personal motivations that connect to today’s theme.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Participants break into pairs, chairs facing each other.\nMaterials needed: None.\nPre‑activity checks: Ensure everyone has a partner; clear floor space.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s get to know each other a bit. Turn to the person next to you and finish this sentence: ‘I became an architect because …’”\u000b “Share for 3 minutes—1.5 minutes each—then we’ll call for a few volunteers to summarize what they heard.”\nKey Points\nConnection: Personal stories create engagement.\nDiversity: Different motivations enrich our cohort.\nRelevance: Ties individual goals to workshop outcomes.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“One of our past participants said, ‘I build homes because my grandmother had no indoor bathroom during winter’—a powerful reminder of why design matters.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1: Pair up and share your sentence for 3 min total (1.5 min each).\nStep 2: One partner listens and remembers one key word.\nStep 3: After 3 min, call out for 2–3 volunteers to share their partner’s word and why it stood out.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Pairs start off‑topic.\nSolution: Gently remind: “Focus on the ‘because…’ prompt about architecture.”\nIssue: One partner dominates.\nSolution: Signal half‑time: “Please switch roles now.”\u000b\nTransition\n“Thanks for sharing! Hearing your ‘why’ reminds us of our purpose. Next, let’s do a quick “Guess the Architectural Icon” challenge.”\n7\n\nWhat are the 3 influences when a client is choosing a design for a new home?\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:35 - 09:40 – What Are the Primary Choice Criteria for a New Home?] (5 min)\nPurpose\nEngage participants by eliciting real‑world priorities and set context for the pre‑assessment quiz.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer at front with slide displayed; participants seated in a semi‑circle.\nMaterials needed: Projector with slide loaded; whiteboard or flipchart and marker.\nPre‑activity checks: Ensure marker works; slide text visible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Before we dive into our quiz, let’s tap into your experience: What matters most to people when choosing or building a new home? Think about your own clients or family.”\u000b (Pause 10 s for thought.)\u000b “I’ll call on a few of you—what choice criteria come to mind?”\u000b (Field 2–3 responses, jot keywords on flipchart.)\u000b “Great insights! Common themes are cost, comfort, location, culture, and sustainability. In this workshop, we’ll see how heritage design touches on all of these.”\nKey Points\nCost: Budget constraints and long‑term operating expenses.\nComfort: Thermal comfort, air quality, and daylight.\nContext: Cultural fit, local materials, and environmental impact.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul’s rebuilding, many families first worry about generator fuel cost—so passive cooling directly addresses their top criterion.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1: Invite 3 volunteers to share one criterion each (2 min).\nStep 2: Trainer summarizes and groups similar ideas (1 min).\nStep 3: Link summary to upcoming quiz (“these are the kinds of questions you’ll see”) (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Silence or hesitation.\nSolution: Prompt with examples: “What about monthly fuel bills?”\nIssue: Too many responses.\nSolution: Cluster similar ideas quickly to move on.\u000b\nTransition\n“Excellent—your answers show us the real stakes. Now let’s test your baseline knowledge with a quick pre‑assessment quiz.”\n8\n\nCost\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:35 - 09:40 – What Are the Primary Choice Criteria for a New Home?] (5 min)\nPurpose\nEngage participants by eliciting real‑world priorities and set context for the pre‑assessment quiz.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer at front with slide displayed; participants seated in a semi‑circle.\nMaterials needed: Projector with slide loaded; whiteboard or flipchart and marker.\nPre‑activity checks: Ensure marker works; slide text visible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Before we dive into our quiz, let’s tap into your experience: What matters most to people when choosing or building a new home?

Next, let’s explore wind‑tower houses from the wider Middle East.”\n32\n\nZero‑Energy Cooling\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nStack effect pulls hot air up the tower.\nCool shaded air is drawn into rooms.\nTypical temperature drop indoors: ≈ 5 °C.\nNo electricity required → “zero‑energy fan.”\n[11:20 - 11:30 – Middle‑Eastern Wind‑Tower Houses] (10 min)\nPurpose\nIllustrate how wind‑towers provide continuous, energy‑free ventilation, complementing the courtyard principle just discussed.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer stands to the left of the screen.\nMaterials needed: Slide with Bastakiya section drawing (left) and Qasr Al Hosn photo (right).\nPre‑activity checks: Confirm both images are clear; bullet text visible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Our next heritage tactic is the wind‑tower—sometimes called a ‘zero‑energy fan.’”\n“Look at the section drawing on the left. Warm air rises naturally inside the tower, escaping at the top. As it exits, it pulls cooler shaded air from the courtyard into the living spaces below.”\n“Field measurements show an indoor drop of about five degrees Celsius—all without a single watt of electricity.”\n“On the right is Qasr Al Hosn in Abu Dhabi. Those white towers still demonstrate this principle today.”\u000b\nKey Points\nStack Ventilation: Rising hot air drives continuous airflow.\nPassive Cooling: Lowers indoor temperature ≈ 5 °C.\nEnergy‑Free: Operates day and night without mechanical fans.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“An architect in Basra retrofitted a small wind‑tower on a two‑story house and reduced AC run‑time by 20 %, saving fuel costs immediately.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1 (5 min): Ask participants to trace the air path with their finger in the air—up the tower, down into rooms.\nStep 2 (2 min): Poll: ‘Could this fit your client’s plot height?’ Thumbs‑up (yes) or thumbs‑down (needs adjustment).\nStep 3 (1 min): Note one barrier shouted out (e.g., extra height, building code) on flipchart.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants confuse wind direction with stack effect.\nSolution: Emphasize: “Wind helps, but the main driver is rising warm air.”\nIssue: Concern about cost or appearance.\nSolution: Mention low‑cost prefab tower modules now available.\u000b\nTransition\n“Wind‑towers use vertical airflow. Now let’s see how horizontal shading in narrow streets and compact mass cools whole neighborhoods.”\n33\n\nNarrow, Shaded Streets & Compact Mass\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMutual shading keeps walls ≈ 6 – 8 °C cooler\n1 m brick walls store heat, \u000brelease it at night.\nWinding alleys cut direct sun and channel breezes.\n[11:30 - 11:40 – Narrow, Shaded Streets & Compact Mass] (10 min)\nPurpose\nIllustrate how compact urban fabric and thick masonry walls passively lower façade temperatures and improve comfort.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer front‑left; slide full‑screen.\nMaterials needed: Projector; pointer/laser.\nPre‑activity checks: Confirm images display clearly and bullet text reads: “≈ 6 – 8 °C cooler.”\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“This slide shows Al‑Kadumia’s maze of narrow streets in Baghdad. When walls shade each other, façade surfaces run about six to eight degrees Celsius cooler than wide, sun‑exposed roads.”\n“That number comes from two field studies: one by Al‑Dujaili & Al‑Anbari (2022) in Baghdad and another 2021 capstone from the University of Mosul—both used infrared scans on historic alleys.”\n“Add thick, one‑metre brick walls and you get thermal mass that stores daytime heat and releases it after sunset.”\n“The winding alleys also channel breezes, making streets walkable even at midday.”\u000b\nKey Points\nMutual Shading: Close spacing blocks direct sun.\nThermal Mass: Thick masonry delays indoor heat peaks.\nMicro‑Climate: Narrow alleys promote airflow and social interaction.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul Old City, sensors showed a shaded alley wall at 33 °C while an open road wall nearby measured 41 °C at the same hour.”\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1 (3 min): Ask pairs to guess the temperature difference before revealing the 6 – 8 °C figure.\nStep 2 (2 min): Quick thumbs‑up/down: could their client plot allow a shaded side alley or shared party wall?\nStep 3 (1 min): Note one barrier or opportunity voiced.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants confuse thermal mass with insulation.\nSolution: Clarify: “Mass delays heat flow; insulation blocks it—both can work together.”\nIssue: Concern about daylight.\nSolution: Remind that windows and courtyards still supply light while streets shield harsh sun.\u000b\nTransition\n“We’ve now covered courtyard cooling, wind‑tower ventilation, and narrow‑street shading.

Why does the top floor of a Mosul home feel like an oven?”\u000b (Pause 1–2 suggestions.)\n“On screen are the three big drivers:\u000b • ☀️ Solar gain on the roof—intense sun bakes flat concrete.\u000b • 🏠 Poor roof insulation—bare tile conducts heat indoors.\u000b • 🌬️ Lack of stack‑vent cooling—no path for hot air to escape.”\n“Those combine to push temperatures well above comfort. Speaking of which, what do you consider a ‘comfortable’ indoor temperature? Official standards say 24 °C, but many people in Mosul only feel okay around 27 °C or higher.”\u000b\nKey Points\nSolar Gain: 3 000+ hours of sun per year heat roofs like frying pans.\nInsulation Gap: Concrete tile has low R‑value—heat floods inside.\nStack‑Vent Missing: Warm air pools at ceiling level without a chimney effect.\nComfort Threshold: Cultural norms shift comfort toward 27 °C in local homes.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In a recent study, flat‑roof homes in Mosul reached 60 °C at noon, while a well‑insulated heritage courtyard house stayed below 30 °C.”\n\nActivity Instructions\nStep 1 (30 s): Shout out any other drivers you’ve observed (e.g., dark roof paint, no overhang).\nStep 2 (30 s): Call out the comfort temperature you prefer at home—24, 27, or another number.\nStep 3 (3 min): Trainer collects a few responses and notes the range, then bridges to our next slide on First Principles.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants equate wind‑towers with fans.\nSolution: Emphasize this is about stack ventilation—passive air movement.\nIssue: Debate over comfort numbers.\nSolution: Acknowledge variation; stress we’ll learn how to meet both standards.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now that we’ve named the pain, let’s dive into the First Principles framework that underpins all the heritage tactics we’ll practice.”\n35\n\nMosul Heat & Heritage Logic\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nFirst Principles:\nThermal: How heat transfers by conduction and radiation.\nHumidity: Moisture’s role in comfort and evaporation.\nAirflow: Buoyancy drives stack effect.\nEvaporation: Surface cooling via moisture phase change.\nMass: Thermal storage delays temperature swings.\nSolar: Sun angle, shading, and absorption.\n[11:45–11:50] – Mosul Heat & Heritage Logic (5 min)\nPurpose\nLink the six core physical factors to the heritage “hacks” we’ve just seen—so participants can recognize how each principle maps to real examples.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Trainer center‑front; slide full‑screen.\nMaterials needed: Projector with first‑principles list.\nPre‑activity checks: Ensure text is legible and the three mini‑set examples (courtyard, wind‑tower, shaded alley) are still visible on the side or referenced.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“We’ve looked at three heritage tactics—courtyards, wind‑towers, and narrow streets.

Here’s our shoebox model: incense at the bottom represents sun-warmed air. Watch as the smoke rises up the chimney and pulls fresh air in from below.”  \n*(Light incense, place in base, pause 10–15 s.)*  \n“Notice the continuous flow: as warm air exits, it draws cooler air in through the hole. That’s exactly how heritage courtyards in Mosul stayed comfortable.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Stack effect moves warm air upward naturally.  \n2. Air exchange draws in cooler ambient air at the base.  \n3. Zero energy—relies solely on buoyancy and pressure difference.  \n\nInvestigation ::\n- Buoyancy: Warm air is lighter, so it rises.  \n- Pressure difference: Exiting air creates suction at the base.  \n- Continuous flow: Sustains ventilation without fans.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In a recent Mosul retrofit, adding a 3 m courtyard shaft yielded a **4 °C drop** indoors—enough to run without generators for much of the afternoon.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Observe the smoke path—note where it rises and where air enters.  \nStep 2: In your mind, map these openings onto a real courtyard or window design.  \nStep 3: Think of one way to scale this effect up for a room or roof vent system.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Smoke too faint to follow.\n• Solution: Use a fresh incense stick; dim room lights briefly.  \nIssue: Participants focus only on smoke, not airflow.\n• Solution: Ask, “Where does the new air come from?” while pointing to the base hole.\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that we’ve seen how passive ventilation works, let’s turn about what is green building.”  \n43\n\nWhat Is Green Building?\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🌍 Planet\n“Low-impact materials”\n“Energy ↓, carbon ↓”\n👥 People\n“Healthy indoor air”\n“Comfort & well-being”\n💰 Profit\n“Lower operating costs”\n“Higher asset value”\nExamples in Iraq: \nBabylon Green University LEED campus (In development)\n[12:45 - 12:55] – What Is Green Building?

You see here the three pillars:\n🌍 Planet: we choose materials and systems to cut waste and carbon.\n👥 People: healthy air and comfortable spaces matter as much as efficiency.\n💰 Profit: lower bills and stronger resale value keep projects viable.\n\nIn Iraq, we’re already seeing this in action. The Baghdad Green Zone pedestrian lighting uses solar-powered fixtures, and Babylon’s Green University campus is LEED-certified—proof that theoretical benefits translate into real-world impact.\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Green building isn’t just “eco.” It balances environmental, social, and economic gains.\n2. Health and comfort drive user satisfaction—never overlook the people pillar.\n3. Financial returns (energy savings, higher valuation) win over even the toughest budget guard.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In Mosul’s reconstruction, small solar street-lights in public squares reduced generator use by 70 %—that’s planet + people + profit at work.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Turn to your neighbor and name one green-building item you’ve seen locally (1 min).\nStep 2: We’ll ask three pairs to share one quick example.

We’ll read each, give a concise answer, and then pause for one quick follow-up if needed.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Reinforce key rules (flash-round timing).  \n2. Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker: ΔT Showdown!”  \n65\n\nIce-Breaker – ΔT Showdown\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nΔT Showdown\n\nShout out the biggest temperature drop you recorded yesterday (°C)!\nFirst team to nail their number wins a snack.\n[09:35–09:45] – Ice-Breaker: ΔT Showdown (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\nBuild energy and reinforce Day 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding demo learnings by celebrating real ΔT results.\n\nSetup:\n• Participants remain in their teams.\n• Clear space in the center for “shout-out” action.\n\nMaterials needed:\n• Bell or buzzer.\n• Small snack prize for winning team.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n• Ensure each team has their ΔT reading accessible.\n• Confirm bell/buzzer is working.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Let’s see those ΔT numbers! On my count: 3–2–1… shout your highest temperature drop from yesterday’s demos. Ready? 3–2–1… GO!”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. **Accuracy matters:** Call out the number you measured.  \n2. **Speed counts:** First to shout gets the win.  \n3. **Celebrate data:** Reinforce the value of measuring performance.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In one of our pilot sessions, a team shouted ‘8 °C!’—that matched our courtyard case study and blew everyone away.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer counts down 3–2–1.  \n2. Teams shout their ΔT simultaneously.  \n3. Trainer rings bell for the quickest correct answer.  \n4. Award snack to that team; acknowledge the group’s results.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: Multiple teams shout same number at once.  \n  Solution: Ring bell and ask those teams to raise hands; pick one randomly.  \n• Issue: Incorrect ΔT shouted.  \n  Solution: Ask for a show of hands from teams with the actual reading; confirm before awarding.\n\nTransition ::\n“Great energy—let’s carry that momentum into our morning session but before that, let’s jump to daily agenda !”  \n66\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\n[09:45–09:50] – Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n\n67\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat. \u000bUse IR cameras & empathy maps to find and explain pain.\n2\nMaterials & Trust\nExplore what works for Mosul.

On the left you see heavy materials—brick, stone, concrete—that store heat by day and release it slowly at night. On the right are lightweight insulators—foam boards, fiberglass, aerogel—that block heat transfer altogether.”\u000b (Point down each column.)\u000b “Thermal mass is ideal in climates with large day–night swings—like Mosul’s desert fringe—while insulation excels when you need a strong barrier against continuous sun.”\nKey Points ::\nThermal Mass: Dampens temperature swings by storing heat.\nInsulation: Resists heat flow, keeping interiors cooler continuously.\nTrade-off: Mass is heavy and slow to respond; insulation performs instantly but can degrade.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul, thick brick walls can reduce indoor highs by 4–6 °C after sunset, whereas under-roof insulation keeps afternoon peaks 2–3 °C lower.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPair up with a neighbor and choose one material from each column.\nDiscuss briefly (3 min) which you’d prioritize for Ahmed’s roof and why.\nShare one team’s choice and rationale with the full group (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nConfusing storage vs. blocking? → Ask, “Does this material hold heat so it’s released later, or stop it from coming in?”\nWondering about availability? → Prompt: “Which option can Ahmed source locally—brick or foam?”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent—keep those distinctions in mind. Next, we’ll quantify these effects with our Heat-Gain Demo: Glass vs Shade.”\n76\n\nHeat-Gain Demo: Acrylic “Glass” vs. Cardboard “Mashrabiya”\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nZone\nIR Temp (°C)\nA: Acrylic\n______\nB: Shade\n______\nΔT =\nA – B = __ °C\n“Every 1 °C reduction ≈ X Wh cooling saved”\n10:40–10:55 – Heat-Gain Demo: Glass vs. Shade (15 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Quantify how much extra solar heat a clear glass surface adds compared to traditional shaded treatments.\nSetup:\u000b • Place two sample zones side-by-side on the demo table under a desk lamp.\u000b • Participants remain seated in small groups around the table.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Clear acrylic panel (“glass”)\u000b • Cardboard mashrabiya model (“shade”)\u000b • Adjustable desk lamp\u000b • IR gun\u000b • Tape measure or ruler to set lamp height\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Position the lamp exactly 15 cm above both samples.\u000b • Warm up the IR gun and set to surface-temperature mode.\u000b • Confirm participants can see both zones clearly.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s put our material choices to the test. We have two zones: Zone A is clear acrylic, and Zone B is our cardboard mashrabiya shade. First, I’ll switch on the lamp and let both surfaces heat for 30 seconds—just enough for them to reach a steady state.”\u000b (Turn on lamp; wait 30 s.)\u000b “Okay, let’s record temperatures. Pair up: one of you points the IR gun; the other reads aloud.”\nDemo Steps:\nMeasure Zone A (glass) (1 min):\u000b “Aim at the surface, hold steady, and call out the temperature for Zone A.”\nMeasure Zone B (shade) (1 min):\u000b “Now switch to Zone B and record that reading.”\nCalculate ΔT (1 min):\u000b “On our slide table, write ΔT = Temp_A – Temp_B. That difference shows how much extra heat the glass traps.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\nSolar penalty: Glass traps more heat, raising surface temperature.\nShade benefit: Simple overhangs or lattice can cut ΔT significantly.\nEnergy link: Every 1 °C reduction equates to roughly X Wh of cooling energy saved.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our pilot workshop, glass surfaces heated to nearly 65 °C, while shaded models stayed around 50 °C—ΔT of 15 °C translates into hundreds of watts saved.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nLamp on for consistent heating (30 s).\nRecord Zone A temp (20 s).\nRecord Zone B temp (20 s).\nCompute and announce ΔT (40 s).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nLamp drifts: Tape its base or clamp it in place.\nIR gun misreads reflections: Aim slightly off-axis at a matte spot.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—now that you’ve seen the numbers, let’s shift to how you’ll source these solutions locally with our Supplier Ecosystem overview.”\n77\n\nSupplier Ecosystem Map\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMaterial\nSupplier Type\nExample Vendor\nLocation\nClay Bricks\nBrickworks\nGypsum Plaster\nGypsum Plant\nLimestone Blocks\nQuarry\nTimber Lattice\nCarpentry Workshop\nMashrabiya Screens\nWoodcarving Studio\nReflective Coatings\nPaint Supplier\n10:55–11:05 – Supplier Ecosystem Map (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show teams where and how to source every material and craft element they’ve just learned about.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the “Supplier Ecosystem Map” slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants seated with their notebooks open.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Printed list of local supplier contacts\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the table is fully visible and legible.\u000b • Ensure any printed contact lists are at the side table.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we know which materials and patterns we need, here’s how you actually get them.

Whistle = time to rotate.”\nStation\nFocus & Tools\n1. Courtyard Design Sprint– Work area: A3 plan + scale rulers\nSketch a 3×3 m courtyard, draw airflow arrows\n2. Cardboard + Fan Model– Desk-fan, smoke sticks, cardboard roof\nBuild a mini courtyard model & film a 10-s smoke clip\n3. Shading & ROI Sheet– Laptop with Courtyard-ROI.xlsx\nEnter 300 W/m² → 100 W/m², capture 2.5-yr pay-back screenshot\n11:35 – 11:40 – Apply Intro & Station Timing (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Orient teams to the three hands-on stations, clarify outputs, and set the rotation timing.\nSetup:\nPhysical arrangement: Slide projected; teams seated in their station order.\nMaterials needed: Bell or whistle; printed station cue cards.\nPre-activity checks: Confirm each station’s materials are pre-set and labeled.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Now we move into our Apply block: three practical stations, each 15 minutes long. You’ll rotate through:\nStation 1 – Courtyard Sketch\u000b – On your A3 plan, draw a 3 × 3 m inset courtyard and add airflow arrows.\nStation 2 – Cardboard + Fan Model\u000b – Build a mini ‘courtyard’ tower, light the smoke stick, film a 10-second clip showing airflow.\nStation 3 – Courtyard ROI Worksheet\u000b – On your laptop, enter 300 W/m² → 100 W/m² into the ROI template and capture the 2.5-year payback screenshot.\nI’ll ring the bell at 15 minutes to signal rotation. You’ll complete all three by our Sell block.”\nKey Points:\nClarity: Each station has a single focus—sketch, model, or ROI.\nTiming: 15 minutes each keeps us on track and maximizes hands-on work.\nRotation: Listen for the bell—move quickly to the next station.\u000b\nLocal Example:\n“In our pilot, teams who timed their work well finished all three stations with extra minutes for refinement—use those 25 minutes wisely.”\nActivity Instructions:\nReview the three station descriptions on your cue card (1 min).\nOrganize your team: assign roles (sketcher, builder, scribe) per station.\nStart at Station 1 when I ring the bell—15 minutes on the clock!\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams linger too long on first station.\nSolution: I’ll give a 5-minute warning before rotation bell.\u000b\nIssue: Confusion about outputs.\nSolution: Point to the slide and station cue cards for clarity.\u000b\nTransition:\n“Get ready—when I ring the bell, head to Station 1 for your courtyard sketch. Go!”\n84\n\nStation 1: Courtyard Design Sprint\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDraw a 3 × 3 m courtyard insertion on the plan\nMark airflow arrows showing stack-driven ventilation\nLabel key zones (e.g. shaded, open, living)\nOutput\nPhoto or scan named TeamX_CourtyardSketch.jpg\n[11:40 – 11:55] – Station 1: 3 × 3 m Courtyard Sketch (15 min)\nPurpose\nPractice rapid courtyard concept design, applying passive stack-ventilation principles at true scale.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Each team at a table with A3 site-plan laid flat.\nMaterials needed:\nA3 site-plan printouts\n1:100 scale rulers\nFine-tip markers\nSticky labels for zone names\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nConfirm every table has a ruler and marker.\nEnsure each plan is oriented the same way (north arrow visible).\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Welcome to Station 1! You have 15 minutes to insert a 3 × 3 m courtyard into your 150 m² plan. Use your scale ruler (3 m = 3 cm at 1:100) to draw the void. Then sketch airflow arrows showing warm air exiting and cool air entering through the courtyard.\nLabel three zones (e.g., shaded seating, direct sun, breezeway). When time’s up, take a clear photo, name it TeamX_Courtyard.jpg, and upload it to our shared folder.”\nKey Points\nScale accuracy: 3 m must measure exactly 3 cm on your plan.\nAirflow clarity: Arrows must show direction of cool-in and warm-out.\nHeritage cue: Recall Day 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding’s courtyard demos when zoning functions.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Fatima’s retrofit courtyard was only 3 × 3 m but yielded a 7 °C drop indoors—small footprints can have big impact.”\nActivity Instructions\nConfirm materials at your table (1 min).\nStart sketching your courtyard and arrows (12 min).\nRefine labels in the last 2 min.\nPhotograph & upload before rotating (upload takes < 1 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nOver-detailing: If time is tight, focus on the courtyard and airflow arrows—skip shading patterns.\nScale mistakes: If your courtyard looks off, re-measure with your ruler before adding arrows.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great work—when the bell rings at 11:55, save your image and rotate to Station 2 (Cardboard + Fan Model) to see this airflow in action. Get ready!”\n85\n\nStation 2: Cardboard + Fan Model\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🗂️ Assemble Model\nPlace cardboard roof panel over courtyard opening\n🕯️ Generate Smoke\nLight incense stick inside model\n🎥 Record Clip\n5 s natural stack → 5 s fan-assisted → save as TeamX_StackVent.mp4\n💨 Compare Flows\nNotice smoke speed ↑ with fan on\n[11:55 – 12:10] Station 2: Cardboard + Fan Airflow Model (10 min)\nPurpose\nDemonstrate and record the difference between passive and assisted stack-ventilation in a scaled courtyard model.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement:\u000b Teams gather around their “mini-house” models arranged on low tables.\nMaterials needed:\nCardboard roof panels with central courtyard opening\nIncense sticks + lighter/matches\nUSB-powered desk fan per model\nSmartphone or shared camera tripod\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify each fan powers on at low speed\nConfirm each team has a fresh incense stick and recording device\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Welcome to Station 2! For the next 15 minutes, you’ll build a physical version of your courtyard. First, fit the cardboard roof panel so the opening sits directly over the courtyard void. Then light your incense stick inside to simulate warm air.\nStep 1: Record 5 seconds of smoke rising naturally (fan off).\nStep 2: Switch on the USB fan at low speed and record 5 seconds of the assisted airflow.\nBe sure your video clearly shows smoke movement—name your file TeamX_StackVent.mp4 and upload when you finish.”\nKey Points\nNatural stack effect: Warm air (smoke) rises without assistance.\nAssisted flow: A small cross-vent breeze triples the exhaust rate.\nVisual proof: A clear side-by-side smoke comparison makes the benefit obvious.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul courtyards, families often see similar airflow patterns—no electricity needed to flush out hot air on summer afternoons.”\nActivity Instructions\nAssemble the cardboard roof panel over your courtyard opening (1 min).\nLight the incense stick and record 5 s of natural smoke flow (4 min).\nTurn on the fan, then record another 5 s of assisted flow (4 min).\nReview your clip, rename it TeamX_StackVent.mp4, and upload to the shared drive (6 min total).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nSmoke too faint: Swap for a new incense stick or pause briefly for thicker smoke.\nOff-angle video: Position your camera lens level with the opening, not overhead.\u000b\nTransition\n“When the bell rings at 12:10, we’ll review these clips briefly before rotating to Station 3 (Shading & ROI Sheet). Ready? Go!”\n86\n\nStation 3: Shading & ROI Sheet\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n💻 Open “Courtyard-ROI.xlsx”\nGo to Design Comparator (Tab 1) and review your ΔT & shading inputs\n⚡ Then switch to ROI Calculator (Tab 2):\nBaseline W/m² → 300\nRetrofit W/m² → 100\n📊 Observe payback period (≈ 2.5 years)\n📸 Screenshot → TeamX_CourtyardROI.png & upload\n[12:10 – 12:25] Station 3: Courtyard ROI Worksheet (15 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Translate passive-cooling performance into a clear financial story—now with a quick comparator check up front.\nSetup:\u000b • Teams seated at laptops, power ready.\u000b • File “Courtyard-ROI.xlsx” already open or accessible.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • “Courtyard-ROI.xlsx” on every machine\u000b • Projected example of Design Comparator Tab 1\u000b • Sticky notes (optional)\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the Excel file opens without password prompts.\u000b • Ensure participants can see the projector showing Tab 1.\u000b • Verify the yellow ROI input cells are blank.\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Welcome to Station 3! First, click over to Design Comparator (Tab 1). You’ll see your shading scenario’s ΔT, airflow gains, and other side-by-side metrics. Take 30 seconds to confirm your values look right.”\u000b (Pause 30 s.)\n“Now switch to the ROI Calculator (Tab 2). In the yellow fields, enter 300 for baseline solar gain (W/m²) and 100 for your retrofit case. Watch the pay-back period update—you should see around 2.5 years.”\u000b (Demonstrate with pointer.)\n“Once you have your number, take a screenshot of the pay-back chart, save it as TeamX_CourtyardROI.png, and upload it to our shared folder. This figure will be a key proof point in your Sell block.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\nComparator first: Ensures your inputs match what you just modeled.\nROI metric: Quantifies the financial return of your courtyard retrofit.\nData-driven pitch: A shorter pay-back makes your proposal more compelling.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul, a 2.5-year pay-back is roughly equivalent to generator costs—after that, the courtyard basically pays for itself.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Review your Design Comparator results (30 s).\nStep 2: Enter 300 → 100 in ROI tab (1 min).\nStep 3: Screenshot, name, and upload your ROI chart (2 min).\nStep 4: Be ready to move on to Supplier Speed-Dating when time’s up.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nCan’t find Tab 1? → Ask: “Is the sheet named ‘Design Comparator’ at the bottom?”\nScreenshot tool not working? → Use Snipping Tool or phone camera as backup.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—once your screenshot is uploaded, we’ll jump into Supplier Speed-Dating to practice quick calls with our vendor list.”\n87\n\n🕛 SELL\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\n88\n\nRetrofit ROI Reel\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nUse your live workbook data (Supplier Network & Solution Designer) – keep it real!\n🎯 Price Proof\n⏱️ Pay‑Back\n📣 Call to Action\nQuote ≥ 2 supplier prices (e.g., ‘Bricks @ 250 IQD ea; Foam @ 15 000 IQD/m³’)\nState your 250 m² façade pay‑back (e.g., ‘3.8 yr at IQD X/m²’)\nEnd with ‘Book your retrofit now!’ or similar.\n12:40–12:55 – Make It Viral Challenge (15 min)\nPurpose\u000b Turn today’s supplier quotes and ROI figures into a compelling 60‑second pitch that highlights real savings.\nSetup\nProject the Retrofit ROI Reel slide full‑screen.\nClear the tables for drafting and filming.\nEnsure laptops/tablets are open at:\nSupplier Network → Price Intelligence (for prices)\nSolution Designer → Pay‑Back (for calculated pay‑back)\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nPhones or laptops for filming/drafting.\nYour workbook data: two supplier quotes + pay‑back number.\nOptional props (mini façade model, printed sample).\u000b\nPre‑activity Checks\nConfirm each team’s Current Price and Pay‑Back cells are populated.\nDevices ready to record a 60 s clip or create a slide/post graphic.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Welcome to Retrofit ROI Reel!

I’ll read each aloud, provide a concise answer, then pause for one quick follow-up.”\nQ1: \nQ2: \nQ3:\u000b\nKey Points:\nFormula clarity: ΔAmp × 12 000 IQD = monthly savings.\nSafety first: Incense demo must follow basic fire precautions.\nHybrid design: Mashrabiya + low-E glass can balance light and thermal comfort.\u000b\nLocal Example:\n“In our pilot, a team used tinted glass plus a mashrabiya screen and saw a 5 °C drop—proof that hybrid solutions work.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\nTrainer reads Q1 & answer aloud (1 min).\nPause 10 s for one follow-up comment.\nRepeat for Q2 and Q3.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nNo follow-ups: Prompt by name (“Sara, any quick follow-up on the formula?”).\nOff-topic remarks: Gently steer back: “Great point—let’s keep our focus on safety for the incense demo.”\u000b\nTransition:\n“Excellent—now that we’ve cleared those up, let’s energize the room with today’s ice-breaker!”\n99\n\nIce-Breaker: “R or U? Hands Up!”\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\n[09:25–09:35] Ice-Breaker: “R or U? Hands Up!” (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Get everyone energized and cement the distinction between R-value (insulation) and U-value (conductance) before our deep dive.\nSetup:\u000b Participants remain in their seats or stand in a semi-circle. No materials required.\nMaterials needed:\u000b None.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b Ensure everyone can see the two icons on screen and understands “right = R, left = U.”\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Alright everyone, let’s play ‘R or U? Hands Up!’ I’ll read a quick statement about a material or scenario. If you think it’s about R-value (resisting heat), raise your right hand. If it’s about U-value (letting heat through), raise your left hand. Simple? Let’s test it!”\nStatements (call 6–8):\n“A thick wool blanket in winter.”\n“A single-pane glass window at midday.”\n“A dense cork under a roof slab.”\n“An uninsulated metal roof in July.”\n“A high-performance foam panel.”\n“A thin aluminum sheet.”\n(After each, pause 3 s to let hands go up, then “Right hands! Yes, wool blankets resist heat—R-value. Left hands on glass—U-value, lots of heat gain!”)\nKey Points\nR-value = Resist → right hand.\nU-value = Ugh leak → left hand.\nRapid, hands-up response builds instinct before the formal lesson.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nTrainer reads statement aloud.\nEveryone raises the corresponding hand (right = R, left = U).\nQuickly confirm the correct answer and move on to the next.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nDelayed response: Model one round at full speed, “ready–steady–go,” then ramp up.\nMixed hands: Pause and clarify the rule again—“Right hand for Resist, left for Conduct.”\u000b\nTransition: “Great form! Now let’s flow right into our Daily Agenda.”\n100\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\n[09:35 - 09:40] Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n101\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat.

R-value is our ‘warmth number’  \n2. Quick math keeps quotes honest  \n3. Pitch shows which wall side matters most\n\nActivity Instructions Activity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Walk line-by-line through Learn column -- 1 min  \nStep 2: Ask class to recall yesterday’s ROI idea -- 30 s  \nStep 3: Link to today’s ‘Sun-Side First’ pitch -- 30 s\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions Common Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Math fear -- Solution: Remind calculator allowed  \nIssue: Slide too texty -- Solution: Use pointer spotlight\n\nTransition Transition : :\n“Let’s open the insulation toolbox and start with R-value 101.”\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\n104\n\n“The higher the R-value, the better the insulation quality is”\n“The lower the U-value of a material, the better its performance”\n\n\n\nR = m²·K/W  U = W / m²·K\nInsulation Metrics 101 – R & U\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n0.03 m thickness\nConvert cm → m before using the formula\n09:50–09:55 – Insulation Metrics 101: R & U (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Ground everyone in the core insulation metrics so material choices make sense.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Leave space on the whiteboard for our quick formula work.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Three cut-samples (foam, 3 cm cork, Isocam membrane) labeled with thickness in cm.\u000b • Excerpt of λ-value datasheet.\u000b • Whiteboard & marker.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm each sample shows its thickness in cm.\u000b • Verify the board is clear and marker works.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s start by defining two metrics you’ll use today: R-value tells us how well a material resists heat flow—the higher, the better. U-value is the inverse: it’s the rate of heat transfer per square meter per degree—so lower is better.\nYou’ll see on the slide:\nR = m²·K / W  U = W / m²·K\nAnd a quick reminder: Convert cm → m before using the formula—for example, that 3 cm cork sample is 0.03 m thick.”\u000b (Point to the “0.03 m thickness” icon.)\nKey Points ::\nR = thickness ÷ λ (units m²·K/W)\nU = 1 ÷ R (units W/m²·K)\nAlways convert your thickness into meters first.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul, a 3 cm cork panel (λ ≈ 0.04 W/m·K) gives R ≈ 0.75 m²·K/W—compare that to 1 cm foam (λ ≈ 0.025) which is only R ≈ 0.4.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPass the three samples down each row—feel thickness and spot differences.\nOn the whiteboard, write R = thickness / λ using meters (e.g., 0.03 m / 0.04). Calculate R together.\nInvert that R value to get U, and record it beside your formula.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nConfusing cm vs. m? → Always divide cm by 100 before plugging into R = thickness/λ.\nThinking higher U is better? → Remind: U measures leakiness—lower is more resistant.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—we can now quantify insulation performance. Next, let’s explore typical R-values in common building materials.”\n105\n\nR-Value Table - Common Building Materials\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:55–10:00] – R-Value Table (5 min)\nPurpose : Show the spectrum of insulation performance so teams can choose materials strategically.\nSetup : Project a clear table of 8–10 common materials and their R-values. Leave space on whiteboard for jotting examples.\nMaterials needed : Printed handout or projected slide of R-Value table (foam, cork, brick, concrete, wood, PIR, XPS, EPS).\nPre-activity checks : Ensure everyone can read the smallest font; confirm marker works for whiteboard notes.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Now that we know how to calculate R and U, let’s see real values for materials you’ll actually work with. This table shows R-value per material—higher resistivity means better insulation. Take a moment to scan through and think which ones fit Mosul’s climate and budget.”\nKey Points :\nLightweight foams and PIR/XPS panels have R ≈ 3–6 m²·K/W.\nTraditional materials (brick, stone) sit below R 1 m²·K/W.\nWood and cork are mid-range (R ≈ 1–2 m²·K/W) but offer heritage appeal.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “A 10 cm layer of expanded polystyrene (EPS) gives you around R 2.8—similar to a 15 cm thick traditional mashrabiya wall, but at half the thickness.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, pick two materials—one “high R” and one “low R”—and write their R-values on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 2: Debate which you’d specify for a sun-facing wall vs. an interior partition.\u000b Step 3: Volunteer teams share their choices (1 min each) and rationale.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing material thickness vs. R-value.\u000b Solution: Remind: table is already normalized to standard thickness. Focus on relative performance.\nIssue: Assuming “best R” always wins.\u000b Solution: Emphasize trade-offs: cost, heritage look, moisture risk.\nTransition :\u000b “Great discussion—next we’ll flip these R-values into U-values so you can compare whole assemblies.”\n106\n\nU-Value Table\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[10:00–10:05] – U-Value Table (5 min)\nPurpose : Reinforce the inverse relationship between resistance and conductance so teams grasp why U-value matters in real assemblies.\nSetup : Project the U-Value table slide and leave room on the whiteboard to jot sample calculations. Arrange participants so they can see both screen and board.\nMaterials needed : Projected slide of U-Value table; whiteboard and marker.\nPre-activity checks : Verify slide is legible from back row; confirm whiteboard marker writes clearly.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Here we flip R on its head: U-value tells us how much heat passes through per square meter per degree difference. Lower U means less heat gain. Take a moment to scan: you’ll notice traditional brick sits around U 0.8, while Thermostone is down at U 0.2—four times better.”\nKey Points :\nU = 1/R, so doubling R halves U.\nDense materials like concrete block have high U (≈1.3–1.5).\nSpecialty insulators (Thermostone) can achieve U <0.3 despite light weight.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 30 cm solid brick wall (U ≈0.85) will let roughly three times more heat inside than a 10 cm Thermostone panel (U ≈0.21).”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, choose two materials from the table—one high U and one low U—and calculate the ratio of their heat gains (e.g. 0.85 ÷ 0.21 ≈ 4).\u000b Step 2: Write your ratio and material names on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 3: One pair volunteers to explain why that ratio matters for selecting sun-facing walls.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing U and R units.\u000b Solution: Remind: R in m²·K/W resists heat; U in W/m²·K conducts heat. Higher U = more heat leak.\nIssue: Thinking density improves insulation.\u000b Solution: Emphasize: density affects thermal mass, not directly conduction—focus on U-values for insulation decisions.\nTransition :\u000b “Great insight—next, we’ll see these differences in action under our heat lamp and confirm the numbers with IR readings.”\n107\n\nLow solar gain, low daylight\nGlazing Ratios: Getting It Right\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Schematics of Façade A: 20% Glazing (small window area)\n*Schematics of Façade B: 40% Glazing (moderate window area)\n*Schematics of Façade C: 60% Glazing (large window area)\nBalanced daylight & thermal control\nHigh daylight, high cooling load\n10:05–10:15 – Glazing Ratios: Getting It Right (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Help teams choose appropriate window-to-wall ratios to balance daylighting benefits against cooling penalties.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain seated, sketchbooks or notebooks ready.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Handouts of a façade template for quick sketches\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the three façade graphics and percentages are clear from all seats.\u000b • Verify participants have a pen or pencil for sketching if desired.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Next, let’s tackle glazing ratios—the percentage of your wall that’s glass. Too little, and you lose daylight; too much, and you bake your interior. On screen are three examples:\n20% glazing gives minimal solar gain but also poor daylighting.\n40% glazing hits a balanced sweet spot—good light with manageable cooling loads.\n60% glazing floods the room with light but drives up air-conditioning use dramatically.\u000b In Mosul’s summer, we generally aim for 30–45% glazing to optimize both comfort and energy.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\nLow glazing (<25%) = low solar gain but dim interiors.\nModerate glazing (30–45%) = good daylight with tolerable heat gain.\nHigh glazing (>50%) = bright, but high cooling loads and glare.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our Mosul retrofit, a 40% glazing retrofit with shade fins dropped peak indoor temperatures by 3 °C compared to a previous 60% cut-and-paste glass façade.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nSketch on your notebook one façade with ~35% glazing (2 min).\nDiscuss with your neighbor: what shading detail would you add to that ratio? (3 min)\nVolunteer one idea to the group. (2 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nMisestimating percentages? → Use the façade template handout and lightly pencil shading to count grid squares.\nFocusing only on daylight? → Remind: “Every 1% glazing above 45% can add up to X W/m² of solar gain.”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—now that we know how to size our openings, let’s turn to our next slide: Building Trust Through Accuracy, where we’ll set clear cooling-load targets.”\n108\n\nPresent real numbers—accurate data earns client trust.\nBuilding Trust Through Accuracy\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nIntervention\nCooling Load (W/m²)\nTarget\nUnshaded concrete wall\n~300\n🚫 too high\nInsulated wall (10 cm EPS)\n~200\n✓ acceptable\nCourtyard-shaded wall or overhang\n~100\n★ ideal\n10:15–10:25 – Building Trust Through Accuracy (Cooling-Load Targets)\nPurpose:\u000b Show how setting clear cooling-load targets (in W/m²) and sharing them honestly with clients builds credibility and trust.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain at their seats with notebooks.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Printed “target sheet” for quick reference\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the table and icons are legible.\u000b • Ensure participants have a pen and can sketch if they wish.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we understand how to size our glazing and materials, let’s talk accuracy. Clients value real data. On screen are three representative cooling-load figures for Mosul:\nAn unshaded concrete wall runs around 300 W/m², which is prohibitive.\nAdding 10 cm of EPS insulation brings it down to 200 W/m², an acceptable level.\nA courtyard-shaded wall or well-designed overhang achieves 100 W/m², our ideal target.\u000b\nWhen you present these numbers clearly, you earn your client’s trust—because you’re honest about performance and realistic about outcomes.”\nKey Points ::\nQuantified targets: Share W/m² goals for each intervention.\nBenchmarking: Show “too high,” “acceptable,” and “ideal” zones.\nAccuracy = Trust: Clients respect data-driven transparency.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In a recent Mosul retrofit, we showed homeowners the simulated cooling loads: they switched from an initial 280 W/m² design to a courtyard solution hitting 95 W/m²—and signed the contract on the spot.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPair up and pick one intervention from the table.\nSketch (in words) how you’d explain its W/m² target to a client in under 15 seconds.

Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s we go to daily agenda.”  \n130\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\n[09:25–09:30] Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale.

We’ll read each, give a concise answer, and then pause for one quick follow-up if needed.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Reinforce key rules (flash-round timing).  \n2. Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker:!”  \n155\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n[09:20 – 09:25] Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context.

With just two small grants, she and her team restored two of the four historic qunatra, reviving stone arches and community pride against all odds.”\n  “Next is Wifaq—a civil engineer who applied a simple, heritage-inspired cork render to his family’s home. He measured a **17 °C drop** indoors—enough that his children moved off the blistering rooftop and back upstairs, and that generator fuel bills fell sharply.”\n  “Finally, Laith always says, ‘Trust is our currency in Mosul.’ By delivering one exceptional heritage retrofit, he earns ten new referrals—proving that empathy and technical rigor travel hand-in-hand.”\n  “By the end of this week, you’ll have the tools to slash heat, boost comfort, and build trust—just like Fatima, Wifaq, and Laith.”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. Local Leadership: Small, community-driven projects can transform public space (Fatima).  \n  2. Tangible Results: Simple materials deliver measurable comfort gains (Wifaq).  \n  3. Emotional ROI: Empathy-driven quality work multiplies referrals (Laith).\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In 2024, another Mosul engineer applied that same cork render in a school—students reported falling asleep more comfortably during lessons.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Listen to each story (2 min).  \n  Step 2: Reflect silently: Which story resonates most with you? (1 min)  \n  Step 3: Turn to a neighbor and share your pick in one sentence. (3 min)  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: Stories feel abstract.  \n    Solution: Prompt: “Imagine living in that home—what difference would 17 °C make for your family?”  \n  Issue: Pair-shares go off-topic.  \n    Solution: Refocus: “Name the one lesson you’d take from this story.”\n\nTransition ::\n  “With those examples in mind, let’s dive into our pre-assessment and see where we all stand before we begin the training.”  \n\n\nDesign Studio Setup & Safety\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWorkstations Ready\nOpen your Revit/Rhino model & Courtyard-ROI.xlsx\nPower & Backup\nPlug in chargers 🔋\nSave frequently to TeamX_DesignStudio.*\nFile Naming\nUse TeamX_SunWall.rvt, TeamX_ROI.xlsx, TeamX_SectionSketch.png\nTiming\n70 min total → bell signals rotation\nSafety First\nTidy cables → no trips 🧹\nProtect laptops from spills ☕\n[11:20 – 11:25] APPLY Intro – Design Studio Tasks & Safety (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Orient teams to the digital‐studio workflow, tools, and safety/file‐management rules before the hands-on session.\nSetup:\nParticipants at laptop stations, models & Excel file open.\nSlide projected full-screen with key reminders.\u000b\nMaterials Needed:\nRevit/Rhino sample file & Courtyard-ROI.xlsx on each laptop\nPower strips and extension cords\nPre-printed quick-reference card with file-naming convention\u000b\nPre-activity Checks:\nConfirm all laptops are plugged in and charging.\nVerify that each team can open the model and ROI file.\nEnsure network or shared-drive access is working for saves.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Welcome to our Design Studio!

Use the template on your table, pick a color for each layer—insulation, structure, waterproofing, finish—and label the R or U-value in the legend. This visual will help clients immediately grasp how your design achieves comfort.”\nKey Points:\nClarity: Distinct colors help distinguish layers at a glance.\nData: Including R/U-values ties visuals back to performance.\nConsistency: Match colors to your BOQ materials for coherence.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In one project, teams used green for bio-insulation and gray for concrete; clients loved the instant “map” of comfort zones.”\nActivity Instructions:\nChoose your four colors and assign each to a material layer. (2 min)\nSketch the layers on the template and fill in the legend with values. (6 min)\nTake a photo of your finished sketch and upload it. (2 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Colors too similar.\u000b Solution: Pick high-contrast markers or add pattern fills.\nIssue: Forgetting to label values.\u000b Solution: Check your BOQ’s material R/U-values before you start.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great work—now let’s convert between area, piece, and volume in our final drill.”\n190\n\nStep 6 – Mind-Map Node Update\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMind-Map Refresh\nAdd new nodes for today’s insights:\nΔT savings 💧\nMaterial cost vs performance 💰\nDigital modeling benefits 💻\nUse a sticky note and place it on the mind-map board\nCluster related ideas under “Thermal,” “Cost,” or “Design”\nTime: 12:25 – 12:30 (5 min)\u000b Session: Step 6 – Mind-Map Node Update\nPurpose:\u000b Capture fresh insights from the Design Studio so our collective mind-map stays current and reflects today’s thermal, financial, and digital wins.\nSetup:\nBring teams back to the mind-map wall or canvas.\nProvide a supply of sticky notes and pens nearby.\nDisplay the prompt slide for reference.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nSticky notes (various colors)\nPens or markers\nExisting mind-map chart on wall\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nEnsure mind-map area is clear for new notes.\nConfirm each team has at least one sticky note and pen.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “We’ve gathered a lot of data today—ΔT savings, BOQ numbers, and even our first digital modeling steps. Now let’s refresh our collective mind-map. On a sticky note, jot one new insight from your studio work under Thermal, Cost, or Design. Then place it on the board in the matching cluster.”\nKey Points:\nConciseness: One insight per note keeps the map readable.\nCategorization: Align each note to Thermal, Cost, or Design for clarity.\nEngagement: Everyone’s contribution enriches the group’s knowledge.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In yesterday’s session, a team added ‘8 °C ΔT → 36 000 IQD/mo saved’ under Thermal—and that note sparked our follow-up on payback.”\nActivity Instructions:\nWrite one key insight from your Design Studio work on a sticky note. (2 min)\nPlace it on the mind‐map under the correct category. (2 min)\nStep back and take a quick look at newly added nodes. (1 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Sticky note text too long.\u000b Solution: Remind: “Keep it to a short phrase or number.”\u000b\nIssue: Misplaced notes.\u000b Solution: Prompt: “Which cluster—Thermal, Cost, or Design? Let’s place it there.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great map update!

First, we draw a 3 × 3 m wall—area of 9 m². Next, multiply by your planned thickness—0.2 m—so volume is 1.8 m³. Then enter your rate, say 80 000 IQD per cubic meter. Watch: the Sub-total column automatically shows 144 000 IQD. No extra calculator needed—your spreadsheet does the heavy lifting!”\nKey Points:\nArea → Volume: Always multiply area by thickness for volume.\nRate consistency: Use the same unit rate (IQD/m³).\nAuto-calc: Set formulas once—then data entry drives results.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In our Mosul pilot, one team’s 1.8 m³ of mashrabiya screen at 80 000 IQD/m³ cost just 144 000 IQD—easy for clients to compare against their generator bills.”\nActivity Instructions:\nI’ll demo on screen while teams watch (2 min).\nNow over to you: each team picks one BOQ line, draws the area, enters thickness and rate (5 min).\nConfirm your sub-total matches the live demo example (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nFormula errors: Check that your Sub-total cell uses =Rate*Qty.\nUnit mix-ups: Verify you’re using m³ rates for volumetric items, not m² rates.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent—now you’ve seen how BOQ and math tie together. Next, we’ll move into LEARN-2: From BOQ → Comparative ROI, where we’ll turn these costs into savings narratives.”\n194\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nEmbodied Energy Flash\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nTotal energy used from material extraction through construction\n\n\n✅ Pro: Local materials ↓ transport emissions\n⚠️ Con: Specialty panels ↑ upfront carbon footprint\n[10:25 – 10:30] Embodied-Energy Flash (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Raise awareness of the hidden energy cost in building materials to inform more sustainable BOQ choices.\nSetup:\nTrainer stands beside screen displaying the slide.\nNo additional handouts required.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nProjector & clicker\nSlide queued and visible\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nConfirm the “Embodied Energy” icon renders correctly.\nEnsure slide text is legible from back row.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Let’s zoom out from operational energy and look at embodied energy—the total energy invested before a building even operates, from quarry to onsite assembly. In one sentence: embodied energy sums all the upstream energy in your materials.”\n“Notice the trade-offs: using local stone slashes transport emissions, but specialty high-performance panels can carry a higher upfront carbon footprint despite their operational benefits.”\n\nKey Points:\nLifecycle View: Assess both upfront (embodied) and ongoing (operational) energy.\nMaterial Choice: Local vs. exotic materials each have pros and cons.\nBalanced Design: Aim for materials with moderate embodied energy and strong thermal performance.\n\nActivity Instructions:\nThink of one material on your BOQ—estimate whether it has high or low embodied energy.\nShare your pick in one sentence with the person next to you (2 min).\nWe’ll ask two volunteers to share back (1 min).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Confusing embodied vs. operational energy.\u000b Solution: Clarify “embodied = before use; operational = during use.”\nIssue: No volunteer insights.\u000b Solution: Prompt: “Name a material you see on site — likely high or low embodied energy?”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great insights!

Ask: ‘What’s your current per-unit price and delivery timeline?’ Jot their answer on your BOQ.\u000b Now, let’s compare how that real price will slot into a slick PDF you email versus a crisp printed deck you hand over. Notice how on-screen you can embed links; in print you simplify footers, boost chart contrast, and leave space for signatures.”\nKey Points:\nReal numbers: Live supplier rates beat guesswork.\nVisual hierarchy: Large headings & call-outs guide the reader.\nFormat fit: PDFs can link; print must stand alone.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In last month’s Mosul pilot, teams who called suppliers on the spot cut their quoting time in half—and proposals felt far more credible.”\nActivity Instructions:\n📞 Supplier call (2 min): Dial, confirm price + lead time, record on your BOQ.\n🖥 PDF scan (2 min): Note one element to add/remove for clarity.\n📄 Print check (2 min): Highlight a contrast/layout tweak on the handout.\n🔄 Pair-share (2 min): Swap insights with a neighbor.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: No answer on first ring. → Solution: Leave a quick voicemail: “Please text your per-unit cost for our quote.”\nIssue: Supplier price seems off. → Solution: Ask, “Does that include delivery?” and adjust BOQ accordingly.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great insights and real prices in hand—let’s take a 30-minute break and come back ready to apply these to our afternoon design studio.”\n196\n\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nTask 2 – Run Ladybug Simulation → kWh Saved\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🔨 Input Model\nEnsure “Sun‐Wall” layer is ON\nSet weather file: Mosul_HOURLY.epw\n\n▶️ Run Simulation\nLaunch Ladybug → Annual Energy → Cooling kWh\n\n📊 Export Results\nNote “Cooling Load (kWh)” for baseline vs retrofit\n\n💾 Save Output\nScreenshot graph → Team#_Ladybug_kWh.png\n[11:40–11:55] – Task 2: Run Ladybug Simulation → kWh Saved (15 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quantify annual cooling energy savings from your sun‐wall model by running a Ladybug simulation.\n\nSetup:\n  • Teams at digital-studio workstations with their refined 50 m² sun-wall model loaded.  \n  • Trainer computer mirroring one sample simulation to the screen.\n\nMaterials needed:\n  • Rhino/Grasshopper with Ladybug plugin.  \n  • Mosul weather file (Mosul_HOURLY.epw).  \n  • Screenshot tool.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Verify each team’s model has the courtyard layer toggled correctly.  \n  • Confirm the Ladybug plugin is installed and visible.  \n  • Ensure the weather file is loaded in each Grasshopper definition.\n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “First, toggle your ‘Sun-Wall’ model and load the Mosul_HOURLY.epw weather file into Ladybug’s Energy simulation component.”  \n  2. “Click ‘Run Annual Simulation’ and wait for the cooling-load report—this will take 1–2 minutes.”  \n  3. “Once complete, find the summary panel showing Cooling Load in kWh per year. Note both the baseline and retrofit values.”  \n  4. “Take a clean screenshot of that summary graph and save it as `Team#_Ladybug_kWh.png`.”\n\nKey Points:\n  1. Model Accuracy: The simulation only reflects what’s visible—double-check your layers.  \n  2. Consistent Weather: Always use the same Mosul_HOURLY.epw file for comparability.  \n  3. Clear Export: The screenshot is your proof of kWh savings—make sure axes and legends are visible.\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Load model & weather file (2 min).  \n  2. Run the annual cooling simulation (5 min).  \n  3. Compare baseline vs retrofit kWh (4 min).  \n  4. Screenshot & save with correct filename (4 min).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Simulation error: Check that all geometry is baked and internalized in Grasshopper.  \n  • Missing weather file: Download from the shared folder and reload.  \n  • Screenshot overlaps UI: Collapse unnecessary panels before capture.\n\nTransition:\n  “Great—now you have your annual kWh savings. Let’s turn those into monetary terms in Task 3 by updating your full BOQ with unit-price look-ups.”  \n197\n\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nTask 3: Complete Your Full BOQ\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🔧 Item\n📐 Unit\n🔢 Qty\n💰 Unit Price (IQD)\n💵 Subtotal (IQD)\n3×3 m Sun-Wall\nm³\n1.8\n75 000 /m³\n135 000\nCourtyard Mashrabiya\npiece\n1\n40 000 /piece\n40 000\nCork Render (150 m²)\nm²\n150\n25 000 /m²\n3 750 000\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n🔄 Tip: Use the formula:\nArea (m²) × Thickness (m) = Volume (m³)\nthen multiply by your unit price\n[11:55–12:20] – Task 3: Complete Full BOQ with Unit-Price Look-Ups (25 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Translate your model and simulation insights into a detailed, client-ready Bill of Quantities.\n\nSetup:\n  • Each team at their laptop with the BOQ template open.  \n  • Projector displays the sample BOQ slide for reference.  \n\nMaterials needed:\n  • BOQ Excel/Google Sheet template loaded.  \n  • Calculator (or built-in sheet formulas).  \n  • Reference unit prices handout.  \n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm that each team’s template has the correct column headers.  \n  • Verify unit-price handouts match the latest market rates.  \n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “Review our BOQ template: Item, Unit, Quantity, Unit Price, Subtotal. Notice how quantities may be in m², m³, or piece.”  \n  2. “For each line, convert your area → volume using the formula on the slide, then enter the corresponding unit price.”  \n  3. “Watch your Subtotal column auto-populate—this is your material cost per item.”  \n  4. “Complete all key retrofit items: walls, shading screens, renders, and any extras you’ve designed.”  \n\nKey Points:\n  1. Unit consistency: Always match your quantity to the declared unit (e.g., m³ for volumes).  \n  2. Accurate pricing: Use our handout’s latest rates to avoid cost overruns.  \n  3. Formula check: Ensure your spreadsheet formulas are correct—Qty × UnitPrice = Subtotal.  \n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Convert each design element from your model into a BOQ line.  \n  2. Apply unit conversions (area→volume) where needed.  \n  3. Enter unit prices and verify each Subtotal.  \n  4. Sum all Subtotals to get your project’s total material cost.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Mismatched units: If area shows in m² but price is per m³, pause and recalculate volume first.  \n  • Missing prices: Flag any absent rate—use the average from the handout as a placeholder.  \n  • Formula errors: If the Subtotal isn’t populating, check that the cell references match your Qty and Unit Price cells.  \n\nTransition:\n  “Great work—now that you have your full BOQ, let’s convert those energy savings into real IQD figures on our Auto-ROI sheet in Task 4.”  \n198\n\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nTask 4: Auto-ROI Sheet → Yearly IQD\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🧮 Formula Flow\nΔHeat Gain (W/m²) → ΔEnergy (kWh/yr)\nΔEnergy × Tariff (IQD/kWh) = Annual Savings (IQD/yr)\nΔW/m²\nArea (m²)\nΔkWh/yr\nTariff (IQD/kWh)\nSavings (IQD/yr)\n200\n50\n(200×50×24×365)/1000 ≈ 87 600\n500\n43,800,000\n2. 📊 Example Snippet\n💡 Tip: Link your Ladybug kWh output directly into cell B2 for live recalculation\n[12:20–12:30] – Task 4: Auto-ROI Sheet → Yearly IQD (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Convert your simulated energy savings into concrete IQD values to strengthen your financial proposal.\n\nSetup:\n  • Teams remain at laptops with the Auto-ROI spreadsheet open.  \n  • Projector displays the formula snippet slide for reference.  \n\nMaterials needed:\n  • Auto-ROI Excel/Google Sheet with formulas.  \n  • Your Ladybug simulation kWh summary.  \n  • Local tariff handout (IQD/kWh).  \n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm each team’s sheet has ΔkWh/yr and tariff input cells ready.  \n  • Verify tariff value matches today’s market rate (e.g., 500 IQD/kWh).  \n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “On the slide you see how we map ΔW/m² → ΔkWh/year using your Ladybug output. Multiply by your façade area and divide by 1 000 to get annual kWh.”  \n  2. “Next, enter the local energy tariff in IQD per kWh—your sheet will auto-calculate the IQD savings per year.”  \n  3. “This number is essential: it shows clients exactly how much their retrofit saves them on fuel or electricity bills every year.”  \n\nKey Points:\n  1. Direct linkage: Pull your simulation ΔkWh/yr straight into the ROI cell.  \n  2. Live recalculation: Changing the tariff or area instantly updates IQD savings.  \n  3. Clarity: This annual figure anchors your “Ask” in the hook pitch.  \n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Copy your Ladybug ΔkWh/yr into the sheet’s “Energy Savings” cell.  \n  2. Confirm or adjust the tariff cell to today’s IQD/kWh.  \n  3. Review the “Annual Savings” output and note it for your proposal.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Formula error: If savings don’t appear, check that ΔkWh and tariff cells are formatted as numbers.  \n  • Tariff mismatch: If the figure seems too low/high, re-verify the tariff with the handout.  \n\nTransition:\n  “Excellent—now capture that Savings cell and your BOQ table as high-res visuals. In Task 5, you’ll embed them into your proposal deck along with your model screenshot.”  \n199\n\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nIntro & File-Naming\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🖼️ Gallery Placeholder\n Insert photo: Team#_Ladybug_kWh.png\n Insert screenshot: Team#_SunWallModel.png\n Insert BOQ & ROI visuals: Team#_BOQ.png, Team#_ROI.png\n📁 Filename Conventions\nUse Team<Number>_<ContentType>.<ext>\n\nExamples:\nTeam2_Ladybug_kWh.png\nTeam2_CourtyardROI.png\nTeam2_ProposalDeck.png\n💡 Tip: Export all images ≥ 300 dpi for crisp print and screen sharing.\n[12:30–12:40] – Task 5: Capture High-Res Photos & BIM Screenshot (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Prepare professional-quality visuals for your proposal deck, ensuring clarity and impact.\n\nSetup:\n  • Teams open their proposal deck template on laptops.  \n  • Slide projected shows placeholders and naming conventions.  \n\nMaterials needed:\n  • Your saved image files (Ladybug graphs, model views, BOQ/ROI snapshots).  \n  • Deck template with image frames ready.  \n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm each team’s images are exported at ≥ 300 dpi.  \n  • Verify deck template frames are unlocked and sized correctly.  \n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “Now you’ll drag your high-res images into the gallery placeholders in your proposal deck.”  \n  2. “Follow the filename convention `Team#_<Content>.<ext>` so we can track and share easily.”  \n  3. “Make sure each image fills its frame without distortion—right-click → ‘Fit to Frame’ if needed.”  \n\nKey Points:\n  1. Consistency: Uniform naming helps us collate all teams’ assets later.  \n  2. Quality: 300 dpi ensures sharp visuals both on screen and in print.  \n  3. Placement: Use the deck’s built-in frames to maintain layout alignment.  \n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Locate your “kWh Savings” graph and drag into first placeholder (2 min).  \n  2. Insert your Sun-Wall model screenshot into second frame (2 min).  \n  3. Add your BOQ and ROI snapshots into the gallery (4 min).  \n  4. Save your deck as `Team#_FinalDeck.pptx` and upload to Telegram (2 min).  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Image too large/low res: Re-export from source at 300 dpi.  \n  • Frame locked: Right-click frame → Format → Unlock or ask me to unlock.  \n\nTransition:\n  “Great—your deck is now visually ready.
