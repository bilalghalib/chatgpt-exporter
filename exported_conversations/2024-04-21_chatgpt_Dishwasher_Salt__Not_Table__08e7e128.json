      "content": "Dishwasher salt is a specially formulated product used to soften hard water in dishwashers, which helps prevent limescale buildup and aids in the effectiveness of detergents. It consists of large, pure granules of sodium chloride that dissolve slowly without clogging the softener unit.\n\nIt's important not to use regular table salt as a substitute for dishwasher salt. Table salt typically contains additives like iodine and anti-caking agents, which can damage the dishwasher's softener unit and lead to malfunctions. Moreover, the finer grains of table salt can dissolve and clump too quickly, which might block the system.\n\nFor the best performance and longevity of your dishwasher, it's advisable to use salt specifically designed for dishwashers.",

      "content": "Dishwasher salt is technically sodium chloride, the same chemical compound as table salt, but it is not intended or safe for human consumption. It is a much coarser and purer form of salt without the additives like iodine and anti-caking agents that are commonly found in table salt. Additionally, dishwasher salt may be processed in facilities that do not adhere to food-grade standards, which means it could contain impurities not suitable for eating.\n\nTherefore, it's important to use dishwasher salt only for its intended purpose in the dishwasher and not as a substitute for table salt in cooking or seasoning.",
