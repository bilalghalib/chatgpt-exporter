I'm really excited about the progress we've made so far and I wanted to first of all encourage everybody to go over the dashboard.\n\n0:15\n\nSo this is the template. This is how you're going to rock the program. This is how, you're going to be able to know how everything fits together from your assessments all the way to your budget for your project and it's actually quite important.\n\n0:30\n\nSo Richard has a video about how to do the budget planning over here and you'll be able to see how your budget breaks down into, the objectives that you have over here and the objectives are actually connected to your assessments and so we want to be sure that everybody has taken the assessment because\n\n0:51\n\nthe assessment will help you pick the right thing to work on as an objective and the right thing to fund in the budget.\n\n0:59\n\nSo it's all connected. So the way you can, take your assessment, you can see this is my results. I took the ACAP because I'm running an accelerator not an enterprise and you can see over here, take assessment and for you, you'll see fewer of them.\n\n1:11\n\nYou'll just see the enterprise capacity, V1, and you can click take assessment. You'll see your results. I want to encourage people.\n\n1:18\n\nDon't just pick the one with the smallest number. Essentially, you'll want to do more work on something that you already are making good progress with.\n\n1:26\n\nAnd if you've taken notes, you'll be able to see that in the details section. And you can see where you have comments and potentially that might give you a better insight about where to work.\n\n1:37\n\nSo who did the assessments? Let's celebrate. Keenan. Esmin, Jana, Michel, the world sucks, tenus, me, tari, dmariam, a Esmin, Jana, Michel, the world sucks, tenus, me, tari, dmariam, i'm work on your dashboard, so essentially take the assessment and then pick over here which one from the assessment\n\n2:09\n\n, which category would make the most amount of sense for you and then go to the second tab of the program dashboard, this is the template reminder and work on.\n\n2:22\n\nAnd you're budget because we're going to be working on this tomorrow. And I also want to give some shout outs to Richard for making the contents in the community home for the program.\n\n2:34\n\nThis is session three. It already has over here. If you want to know how to make the budget video, click over here and you'll see a great video from.\n\n2:43\n\nRichard about how to develop your budget and how it's all connected. If you need some instructions and then otherwise you can go back to the program to see sprint session two the videos that we've created.\n\n2:56\n\nAnd also it's been great because we've been sharing and learning and growing together here. And the, oh, nice. So they have already uploaded their dashboard for Lebanese spotlight.\n\n3:09\n\nYeah, I'm coming over here. I'm responding to everybody. Feel free to add your questions and your connections here in the Eon program on the community platform along with your your budget plan.\n\n3:23\n\nAfter you make the template, please share it. In sprint session three, this will be a good place to upload it.\n\n3:29\n\nIf you want to know how to do that, you create a new topic. And then you say rooms program, budget budget, and then you can actually just put in links over here.\n\n3:43\n\nAnd that would be great. You can add some questions, we can tag each other. And that's all. So I hope you guys are having a beautiful day.\n\n3:51\n\nI just wanted to walk you over the importance of why we're taking these assessments, how these assessments break down into your program dashboard all the way to the budget so we can see what.\n\n4:03\n\nThe right thing to spend money on is, you know, we have not many opportunities to do things well and do things right.\n\n4:12\n\nSo let's take some time to take the assessment to reflect. And then to design our objectives here in the organization development plan, and then to see how best to spend.\n\n4:23\n\nThe potential funding to take our project forward and make it more established. Okay. I hope you're having a beautiful day.\n\n4:31\n\nAnd I will see you guys tomorrow for day three of the sprint. So that and I'll put this in the community page as well.",
