This system is designed to evaluate the sustainability levels of existing and new buildings. The GZRS is intended as a local rating system that will be formulated and applied within the context of Mosul and Iraq.\n\nProject Description\nThe Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS) is named after the ziggurats, which were iconic structures in ancient Mesopotamian architecture, symbolizing the unique historical and cultural identity of Iraq. The ziggurat, an Akkadian word meaning \"the high place,\" has become emblematic of Iraqi architectural heritage.\n\nThe system will provide a standardized national benchmark to assess the sustainability of buildings, helping to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of construction and promoting a sustainable architectural approach. The objectives of the system include:\n\nProviding a national standard: This will help in assessing the sustainability level of buildings and provide unified national results to achieve sustainability.\nReducing environmental impacts: The system aims to reduce the negative environmental effects of buildings.\nRaising awareness: The system will enhance awareness among the community regarding the environmental aspects of sustainability and the importance of sustainable buildings.\nPreserving identity: The system seeks to preserve and highlight the architectural and cultural identity of Iraq.\nDetails and Rating Criteria\nThe GZRS assesses projects based on their adherence to sustainable development principles. It provides a comprehensive evaluation by examining various dimensions such as energy efficiency, resource management, and environmental impact. The system is designed to encourage improvements in sustainable practices across university projects.\n\nRating Criteria\nThe GZRS includes a detailed scoring system that evaluates projects according to multiple criteria:\nEnergy Efficiency: 10%\nResource Management: 28%\nEnvironmental Impact: 32%\nWater Efficiency: 12%\nWaste Management: 18%\nSustainable Building Materials: 10%\nSustainable Transportation: 5%\nInnovation in Design: 105%\n\nVisual Indicators\nThe system uses visual indicators to demonstrate the overall rating of projects:\n60-70%: 5-level Ziggurat Rating System\n48-60%: 4-level Ziggurat Rating System\n40-48%: 3-level Ziggurat Rating System\n35-40%: 2-level Ziggurat Rating System\n30-35%: 1-level Ziggurat Rating System\n\nCertificates\nCertificates will be awarded to buildings based on their sustainability rating:\n85-100 Points: N/A (Top Level Certificate)\n70-84 Points: 4-Level Ziggurat Certificate\n60-69 Points: 3-Level Ziggurat Certificate\n50-59 Points: 2-Level Ziggurat Certificate\n40-49 Points: 1-Level Ziggurat Certificate\n\nParticipants\nProf. Dr. Qusay Kamal al-Din al-Ahmadi\nProf. Dr. Abd al-Rahim Ibrahim Jassem\nDr. Riham Ali Talib al-Shammari\nDr. Basim Ihsan Abd al-Qadir al-Hafiz\nEng.
