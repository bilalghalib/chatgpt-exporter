He says this in a moment of deep sorrow, showing his reliance on God alone in times of distress. It’s often used to express spiritual surrender and heartfelt connection in hardship.",

      "content": "Yes, you're right—there are a few phrases and sentiments in Islamic tradition that express the idea of turning only to God, especially in times of hardship. Here are a few relevant ones:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **\"Hasbiyallāhu wa ni‘ma al-wakīl\"**  \n**(حَسْبِيَ اللَّهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ)**  \n**\"Allah is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs.\"**\n\nThis reflects full reliance on God alone, often said when facing difficulty or injustice.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **\"Wa ilā Allāhi al-maṣīr\"**  \n**(وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ)**  \n**\"And to Allah is the final return.\"**\n\nUsed to express that everything ultimately goes back to God—including our concerns, actions, and fate.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **\"Lā ḥawla wa lā quwwata illā billāh\"**  \n**(لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ)**  \n**\"There is no power and no strength except with Allah.\"**\n\nThis is a powerful expression of humility and total dependence on God.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **\"Innamā ashkū baththī wa ḥuznī ilā Allāh\"** (as mentioned above)  \nFrom Surah Yusuf 12:86, meaning:  \n**\"I only complain of my suffering and grief to Allah.\"**\n\n---\n\nIf you’re thinking of a more poetic or Sufi phrase that translates to “I complain only to God” or “Only to God do I speak of what is in my heart,” it may not be a direct Qur’anic verse but rather a paraphrase or interpretation of the above concepts—common in Islamic poetry, du’a, or reflection.\n\nWould you like the phrase written in calligraphic Arabic or transliterated for pronunciation?",
