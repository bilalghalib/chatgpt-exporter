      "content": "**Analyzing economic impacts**\n\nI’m piecing together the economic benefits of solar water heaters in Iraq, focusing on energy consumption and potential cost savings.\n\nSure, let me break this down: I’m mapping out the energy consumption partitions in Iraq, then translating this into water heating's energy footprint.\n\n**Calculating total consumption**\n\nI’m piecing together Iraq's total energy consumption, using estimates like the International Energy Agency's data and Iraq's 2023 population of 42 million. This helps set the baseline for my calculations.\n\n# Analyzing energy use\n\nI'm exploring total electricity and energy consumption in Iraq, focusing on household use and water heating. This includes estimating costs and potential savings from solar water heaters.\n\n**Breaking down savings potential**\n\nI’m piecing together a calculation of annual household energy consumption in Iraq, roughly estimating it to be 2,500 kWh, which is higher than in Europe due to cooling needs in the summer.\n\n**Evaluating household consumption**\n\nI’m piecing together Iraq's per capita electricity consumption, estimating it around 1,400 kWh per person annually. With an average household size of 6, this sums to roughly 8,400 kWh per year, though I’m also considering a lower estimate of 6,000 kWh. This estimate focuses on electricity used, excluding generators and other sources.\n\n**Calculating energy use**\n\nI’m figuring out that water heating consumes about 900 kWh per year in a household, given a 15% energy use in warmer climates.\n\n**Estimating cost**\n\nOK, let me see. I’m thinking the cost of electricity per kWh in Iraq could be around 2 to 0.02 US cents, given the subsidized rates.\n\n**Analyzing energy expenses**\n\nI’m calculating the yearly electricity costs for water heating in a household, assuming $0.05 per kWh. The annual cost is $45, which raises questions about the impact of solar water heaters or alternative fuels like gas or LPG.\n\n**Assessing impact**\n\nThe energy savings from solar water heaters, achieving up to 70-80% reduction, are examined. Considering higher energy costs and comprehensive expenses ensures a thorough analysis.\n\n**Taking a closer look**\n\nI’m examining energy costs in different households, noting that subsidized energy in Iraq might offer non-monetary benefits like reduced grid demand and environmental gains.\n\n**Assessing renewable energy**\n\nI’m evaluating the benefits and moves, focusing on how higher energy costs in Iraq make solar water heaters highly cost-effective, considering other gains and future price hikes.\n\n**Analyzing economic feasibility**\n\nI’m considering the cost of installing a solar water heater—$1,000—with payback periods depending on annual savings. The feasibility appears strong with a lifespan of 15-20 years.\n\n**Weighing energy costs**\n\nI’m thinking through energy and efficiency, considering yearly savings of $70 or $200 based on the cost of 2,000 kWh for water heating.\n\n**Weighing benefits**\n\nOK, let's break this down: Low energy costs in Iraq mean modest direct savings. However, the environmental benefits and potential future cost reductions offer significant overall advantages.\n\n**Estimating energy usage**\n\nI'm working on approximating how much energy Iraq uses for water heating, which requires detailed national data that isn't always accessible.\n\n**Measuring water heating**\n\nI'm analyzing global and Iraq-specific data to estimate how much energy water heating consumes in households, considering Iraq's climate and energy patterns. This leads me to determine it contributes 15-20%.",

Al-Hafidh*\nwaelhashem_67@uomosul.edu.iq mahmood14@uomosul.edu.iq alhafidms@uomosul.edu.iq\nElectrical Engineering Department, Collage of Engineering, University of Mosul*\nMechatronics Engineering Department, Collage of Engineering, University of Mosul**\nReceived: 18/8/2021 Accepted: 21/10/2021\nABSTRACT\nThe Iraqi electrical system suffers from an increased electrical load for the available generation, which leads to the\nseparation of a large number of consumers, especially during the peak load period. The water heating load represents a\ngreat value, so reducing water heating consumption can reduce the cut-off times. Solar water heaters possess many\nbenefits. Therefore, they are used in many countries in the world today. The climate of Iraq is mostly hot and sunny. This\nmakes using a solar water heater is convenient for consumers, especially in urban areas. For studying the use of solar\nwater heaters in the residential sector, three consumers were selected in Mosul city in northern Iraq. Each consumer\ndiffers from the others by the value of their consumption of electrical energy (high, medium, and low). Electricity tariffs\nfor the residential sector in Iraq vary, depending on consumption. The information for the three consumers was obtained\nfrom a previous questionnaire. In addition to obtaining their needs for hot water, the results of using solar water heaters\non the roofs of the three houses of consumers showed a decrease in electricity consumption and a noticeable saving in\nthe electricity bill. The payback period of the solar water heater system was calculated for each consumer. Reducing\nconsumption reduces the gap between generation and load, resulting in reduced programmed shedding times for\nconsumers. For these benefits and environmental features, it is necessary to generalize the use of solar water heaters in\nthe residential sector in Iraq.\nKeywords:\nSolar Water Heaters, Iraqi Residential Sector, Electricity Energy Saving, Payback Period.\nThis is an open access article under the CC BY 4.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\nhttps://rengj.mosuljournals.com\n=============================================================================\n1. INTRODUCTION\nDue to the high cost of conventional fuels\n(fossil fuels), the serious environmental problems\nassociated with them, also the growing need to\nrationalize consumption, and use-demand\nrenewable resources, solar energy usage is\nincreasing in both developing and developed\ncountries [1].\nThe problem of energy consumption of\nhousehold appliances has increased in recent\nyears due to the increased load density in the\nresidential sector. Increasing efficiency,\nrationalizing energy consumption, and using\nrenewable energies are the main key to manage\nenergy in the houses [2].\nDue to its share in total consumption, water\nheating in residential units is one of the major\nconcerns in energy consumption for buildings.\nEnergy demand for hot water is being met in\nseveral ways such as the use of electricity or\nfossil fuels. However, heating water with these\nresources is expensive [3].\nResidential loads represent the largest\nconsumer of electrical energy in Iraq. 32.29% of\nthis value is used for heating water [4]. A large\nportion of this demand can be met by using\nrenewable energy (solar water heater) [5].\nHot water is used in houses, hotels,\nhospitals, and factories. The most common way to\nuse a solar heater is to use solar water heaters to\nget hot water. Solar water heating systems\n(SWHS) are used in millions of buildings around\nthe world and they contribute significantly to\nsustainable earth development [1]. The main\ncountries that have benefited from the advantages\nof SWHS are (China [6], Turkey [7], India [8],\nBrazil [9], and Germany).\nTo promote the use of solar heating in a\nresidential building, financial support, tax\nexemptions, and mandatory policies are policies\nadopted by countries such as China, New\nZealand, and many European countries [10].\nThe use of SWHS is a long-term\ninvestment. It brings many benefits like reducing\nAl-Rafidain Engineering Journal (AREJ) Vol.27, No.1, March 2022, pp.56-63\nWael H. Hamdon: Energy Efficiency Enhancement for Residential 57\nenergy demand, saving money spent on heating\nwater. In addition to, reducing emissions of gases\nthat cause environmental problems. The\navailability of hot water for these systems is safe\nfrom power outages [11].\nThe current research shows the use of solar\nheaters in providing hot water to residential units,\nreducing electrical consumption, and reducing the\nelectricity bill. The results showed that these\nbenefits were achieved, in addition to minimizing\nprogrammed cutting.\n2. Research Methodology\nThe Iraqi electrical power system suffers from\nmany problems. One of these problems is the lack\nof sufficient capacity to supply the loads. This\nshortage of generation causes the source to be cut\nfor long periods (programmed cut). Despite the\nrelentless pursuit to increase generation capacity,\nthe growth of loads leads to the continuation of\nprogrammed cuts. Therefore, the appropriate\nsolution is to rationalize loads. The residential\nload represents the largest load in the Iraqi\nelectricity system. Some components of a\nresidential load can be compensated by using\nrenewable energies. The use of renewable\nenergies in rationalizing residential loads, reduces\nprogrammed cutting times, reduces the electricity\nbill, and reduces pollution . . . etc.\nIn cooperation with the Nineveh Electricity\nDistribution - State Company of the Electricity\nDistribution for North – Ministry of Electricity,\nthe electrical load for the residential sector was\nstudied. Studies began to find the Diversity Factor\nof the distribution system [12]. Then to study the\npeak load of residential units [13]. Previous\nstudies led to the conclusion that rationalizing\nconsumption and using appropriate alternatives,\nespecially renewable energies, is the solution. To\ntake appropriate rationalization steps, you must\nfirst know the electric load components.\nThe components of the residential load in\nthe Iraqi system were studied. The residential load\nwas classified into five components. Lighting,\nhome appliances, heating, cooling, and water\nheating. The amount of each component was\ndetermined over months of the year. These\ncomponents were drawn with months for a whole\nyear [14]. In another apervious study, the\npossibility of reducing the Lighting component\nwas studied [15].\nIn another study, the possibility of reducing\nthe water heating component using solar water\nheaters was studied. Solar water heaters were\nadded to a number of houses in the city of Mosul.\nA SWHS reduces, but does not eliminate, the\nneed for electric or fossil fuel heating water. The\nperformance of a SWHS can be defined by a solar\nfraction. The effective solar fraction of a SWHS\ndepends on the intensity of a solar radiation, the\ntechnical characteristics of the individual system\nand the load characteristics [4, 16].\nA small electric heater (1 kW) was added to\nthe solar heater to provide complementary\nheating. The readings recorded the energy\nconsumed in heating water with and without the\nsolar water heater for a full year. The results\nshowed that using a solar water heater reduced\nconsumption from 32.29% to 13.1% (19.19%)\n[4].\nComplementary aspects of previous\nresearch were studied in this research. The current\nresearch aims to study the effect of using solar\nheaters on electricity consumption and electricity\nbill. Also, study the investment payback period.\nThe study was applied to three consumers of\nvarying electricity consumption, low, medium,\nand high consumption. The results showed a\nsignificant reduction in electricity consumption,\nsignificant savings in the electricity bill, as well\nas an adequate payback period. In addition to the\nabove, reducing consumption contributes to\nshortening programmed cutting times.\n3. Weather effect on residential load\nResidential electrical load in Iraq is affected\nby weather, especially temperature. The electric\nload increases in winter due to the use of heating\nequipment and water heating. On the other hand,\nthe electrical load during summer is high due to\nthe use of cooling and refrigeration types of\nequipment. For spring and autumn seasons, when\nthe temperature is moderate, the electrical load is\nrelatively lower compared to summer and winter\nseasons.\nFigure 1 shows the daily minimum (blue) and\nmaximum (black) temperature changes for a full\nyear in Iraq [14]. Readings begin on April 1st and\nend on March 31st. Due to the significant change\nin temperature, the need to heat water in the\nseasons varies. The need to heat water can be\ndivided into four categories:\n1. No need to heat water: There is no need to heat\nwater when the temperature exceeds 40° C. This\ncondition occurs in summer and lasts between 90\n- 100 days.\n2. No need for supplemental heating: The solar\nwater heater provides hot water that is sufficient\nfor the need, without the need for complementary\nheating. This condition occurs at temperatures\nbetween 30-40° C. This condition lasts between\n90-100 days and occurs in spring and autumn.\nAl-Rafidain Engineering Journal (AREJ) Vol.27, No.1, March 2022, pp.56-63\n58 Wael H. Hamdon: Energy Efficiency Enhancement for Residential…..\n3. The need for low complementary heating: The\nsolar water heater does not provide enough hot\nwater at appropriate temperatures for the entire\nhousehold needs. Therefore, the need for\nsupplementary electric heating at a small value is\nnecessary. This condition occurs at temperatures\nbetween 20-30° C. This condition lasts between\n85-95 days in a spring and fall procedure.\n4. The need for high complementary heating: At\nlow temperatures, below 20° C, the need for\ncomplementary heating is high. This condition\nlasts between 70-80 days in winter.\nFigure 1 Daily minimum and maximum\ntemperatures in Iraq.\n4. Solar water heating system SWHS\nIraq receives the highest solar energy in June & July\nwith a values of (5.8 - 7.6) kWh/m2/day, while the\nlowest solar energy in December is (2.5-2.8)\nkWh/m2/day, [17]. The long term average global\nhorizontal irradiation is between (5.0-5.8)\nkWh/m²/day [17, 18], which encourages the use of\nthe SWHS in Iraq.\nA solar water heating system has to be installed\non the rooftop of the houses under this study to\neliminate, or reduce, the electricity consumption\nspent on heating the needed hot water for residential\nusages and evaluate the real application of the\nSWHS.\nSWHS requires some auxiliary or\ncomplementary heating during days of low or not\nenough solar radiation. The auxiliary energy source\nwith installed SWHS is a small capacity of about 1\nkW electric heater.\nThe SWHS types are mainly divided into two main\ngroups, the active systems and the passive system\n[19-22].\n4-1 The active system\nIt contains a pump to circulate the heat\ntransfer fluid throughout the system elements. It\nrequires an electric supply (DC or AC) to run so.\nIt does not work when no electric current. It\nshould be supplied with the control system and it\nmay require the use of freeze-resistant heat\ntransfer fluid, which made this system not\navailable in the Iraqi market [19, 20].\n4-2 The passive system\nIt does not contain a water pump to circulate\nthe working fluid. Its heat transfer fluid circulates\nin the system by bouncy effect, i.e. naturally\nwithout the need for electric power to circulate, as\nrequired in the case of the active system. Also, the\ncontrol units are not needed and the heat transfer\nfluid is normal water available in the house and\nno antifreeze addition is required. Therefore,\nthese systems are simpler and cheaper than the\nactive systems and they are available in the Iraqi\nmarket. The passive SWHSs found in the Iraq\nmarket is divided into two types [19-21]:\n4-2-1 Water-in-glass type passive SWH\ncollectors\nThese systems consist of several evacuated\nsolar Pyrex tubes, directly connected to a metallic\nheat-insulated hot/cold water tank, and\nhorizontally mounted to a metallic frame that\nmounts the solar collector’s parts. These systems\nwere not chosen for this study as they require\nmore careful operating conditions, for example, if\nsome water leak from the sealant has happened,\nsome troubles may result related to water spread\nand if one of the solar evacuated tubes is broken,\nthe whole system completely stops working until\nit would be fixed or replaced [21, 22].\n4-2-2 Flat plate solar collectors\nThe flat plate solar collector is consisted of\nan absorber plate (black coated) to absorb the\nenergy of the solar radiation and conduct the\nabsorbed heat energy to several metallic pipes\nattached or welded to this absorber plate, which\nthrough them the heated water is passed, see\nfigure 2-a. The absorber plate is weather proofed\nby enclosing it in a heat insulated metallic box of\nglass cover from the top side to allow the solar\nradiation to reach the absorber plate. The cold\nwater comes from the bottom of a storage tank\nthrough a pipe to the footer distributing pipe at\nthe bottom of the collector then rises up through\nthe pipes mentioned above as its density becomes\nless when heated. The heated water is collected\nby the header pipe then it continues the flow to\nthe top of the hot/cold water storage tank through\na connecting pipe. The heated water is pushed out\nof the storage tank, to the bathroom, under the\npressure of the makeup water tank installed about\n1.5 m higher than the storage tank, as shown in\nfigure 2-b, [22].\nAl-Rafidain Engineering Journal (AREJ) Vol.27, No.1, March 2022, pp.56-63\nWael H. Hamdon: Energy Efficiency Enhancement for Residential 59\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2 Solar Water Heater used in the\nresearch.\nThe selected SWHS by the authors is a\nsimilar type to those discussed in 4-2-2 mentioned\nabove. It consists of two flat plate collectors\nconnected in parallel and the assembly is\nconnected to a single thermal insulated hot/cold\nwater storage tank. The capacity of the selected\nsystem can be increased, if needed, by adding a\nthird or more collector unit to the system.\n5. Case Study- Iraqi system\nThe current research aims to study the\nsavings in residential electric bills. The electrical\nenergy tariff for the residential sector in Iraq is\nbased on the amount of consumption as in Table 1\n[15].\nTable 1 The electrical energy tariff for the\nresidential sector in Iraq.\nobtained results in the questionnaire were used in\nthis study for three consumers, which are high,\nmedium, and low consumption consumers.\n6.1 Total energy consumption\nThe annual electrical energy consumption of\nthe three consumers (high, medium, and low\nconsumption) with and without solar water\nheaters was studied. Figure 3 shows the monthly\nload of the three consumers. The total annual\nconsumption of the three consumers (without\nsolar water heater) is 40441, 24755, and 14695\nkWh respectively. When adding a solar water\nheater, the consumption is reduced to 32,040,\n19659, and 11,610 kWh respectively. The saving\nis the difference between consumption without\nand with a solar water heater. The ratio between\nsavings and consumption without a solar water\nheater represents the percentage of savings. Table\n2 summarizes the annual consumption with or\nwithout a solar heater, the amount, and the\nsavings percentage. The annual electrical energy\nconsumption savings range between 20.6-21%.\nTotal Consumption\n5000\nConsumption (KWh)\n0\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nTime (Months)\nHigh Medium Low\nlevel of\nconsumption\nthe amount of\nconsumption kWh\nThe price of\nkWh (ID)\nThe price of\nkWh ($)\nlow 0-1500 10 Lessthan1C.\nmedium 1501-3000 35 About 3 C.\nFigure 3 Monthly consumption of the three\nconsumers without SWHS.\nTable 2 Annual consumption and saving of\nthe three consumers.\nhigh 3001-4000 80 About 6.5 C.\nHigh Medium Low\nVery high >4000 120 About 10 C.\nThe study was applied at different levels\nof consumers (three consumers).

SWHS play a pivotal role in addressing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, making it imperative to conduct in-depth studies on their utilization. Hence, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of SWHS. It starts by explaining the principles behind these systems, including their components and classification. Moreover, this review consolidates various studies that have been conducted on SWHS to highlight both their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, a case study is conducted in which it takes into consideration important economic and environmental factors. In particular, it focuses on several scenarios present in Lebanon such as family homes, schools, restaurants hotels and gyms to estimate potential cost savings achieved through implementing SWHS as opposed to relying solely on electric heaters. Furthermore, this investigation also examines the corresponding payback period associated with adopting SWHS along with assessing the significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions possible if these systems were widely implemented. The findings of the study demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the extent to which SWHS are utilized and both the payback period and reduction in CO2 emissions. It was observed that when SWHS are used more frequently, with a high percentage of time (Pr=0.9), significant advantages can be achieved. For instance, for different types of establishments such as family homes, schools, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, it was estimated that average payback periods would be 14.2 years, 4.6 years, 9.2 years, 4.4 years, and 5.3 years, respectively. These results indicate that adopting a greater dependency on SWHSs not only leads to quicker cost recovery but also significantly contributes towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The analysis reveals that the yearly decrease in carbon dioxide emissions per individual is 0.16 t within a household, 0.016 t per student in an educational institution, 0.04 t per customer within a dining establishment, 0.37 t for each occupied bed in a hotel accommodation, and 0.11 t per individual at a gym. This paper serves as guidelines to SWH community. Additionally, it adds a practical insights into economic and environmental issues relevant to both Lebanon and countries with similar climates.\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\nKeywords\nSWHSRenewable energyReviewClassificationEnvironmentEconomy\nNomenclature\nCp\nspecific heat\nρ\ndensity\nC\ncost\nm\nmass\nM\nammount\nN\nnumber\nP\nprice\nPbp\npayback period\nPE\nmonthly price of energy consumed\nPr\npercentage of time when SWHS is utilized\nQ\nenergy\nSM\nsaved money\nV\nvolume\nAbbreviation\nCO2\nCarbon dioxide\nCOP\ncoefficient of performance\nEDL\nÉlectricité du Liban\nEFDM\nexplicit finite difference method\nICSSWH\nintegrated collector / storage solar water heater\nPCM\nphase change material\nSWHS\nSWHSs\nSubscripts\nin\ninlet\nout\noutlet\ns\nsuumer\nw\nwinter\nGreek symbols\nη\nefficiency\nT\ntotal\n1. Introduction\nOver the past few decades, there has been a growing awareness of the critical nature of energy and its impact on human lifestyles. The increasing demand for energy is largely met by conventional sources, which currently account for 80 % of total global energy consumption \n[1]\n. However, it is projected that this demand will continue to rise at a rate of 1.5 % per year until 2030 \n[2]\n, \n[3]\n, \n[4]\n. This dependence on conventional sources raises concerns about their depletion as well as economic and environmental implications. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need to shift towards renewable energy sources \n[5]\n, \n[6]\n, \n[7]\n or implement effective strategies for managing energy through techniques such as energy recovery \n[8]\n, \n[9]\n, \n[10]\n, \n[11]\n, \n[12]\n, \n[13]\n, \n[14]\n. Renewable resources like wind power \n[15]\n, \n[16]\n, solar thermal technologies \n[17]\n, \n[18]\n, \n[19]\n, \n[20]\n, \n[21]\n, \n[22]\n, \n[23]\n, \n[24]\n, biomass utilization [\n25\n,\n26\n], and geothermal options [\n27\n,\n28\n] have emerged as promising alternatives that can mitigate reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, reducing waste in existing systems by implementing measures to capture lost or dissipated energies are also gaining attention.\nSolar energy is widely acknowledged as a highly prospective solution for fulfilling the ever-increasing global energy demands. It offers two main avenues of utilization: thermal applications and electricity generation. While various technologies have been devised to harness solar power, they have often faced limitations when compared to traditional fossil fuel-based systems. Nonetheless, among these approaches, capturing solar thermal energy stands out as an especially efficient method. To shed light on the wide range of possibilities offered by solar thermal technology, \nFig. 1\n presents a visual representation showcasing its primary applications.\nFig 1\nDownload: Download high-res image (348KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 1. Solar thermal energy applications.\n\nSWHSs have long been regarded as an elegant and efficient application of solar thermal energy. These systems operate by absorbing the sun's radiant energy and converting it into usable heat to warm water. The concept behind SWHS is relatively simple yet remarkably effective in harnessing solar radiation, offering both economic and environmental benefits. The origin of SWHS can be traced back to the 18th century when Horace-Bénédict de Saussure developed the first known system for efficiently capturing solar heat \n[29]\n. However, it was not until 1891 that Clarence Kemp introduced the first commercially produced SWHS. This pioneering batch system featured a metal tank enclosed within a wooden box covered with glazing material. On sunny days, this rudimentary setup could achieve hot water temperatures as high as 38.8 °C. In 1909, William Bailey revolutionized the SWHS by patenting the first thermosiphon-type SWHS. This innovative design featured a tank positioned above the level of the solar collector \n[30]\n. As sunlight heats up the water in the collector, it becomes lighter and rises to the top of the tank. Simultaneously, cooler water enters from below to replace what has risen. Since then, SWHS systems have gained popularity worldwide and currently dominate about 80 % of the global solar thermal market \n[31]\n. These systems are widely utilized not only in homes but also in various service sectors due to their efficiency and reliability. It is worth mentioning that globally, residential and service sectors account for approximately 35.3 % of total energy consumption. Out of this significant percentage, an astonishingly high proportion (75 %) is attributed solely to meeting the needs for water and space heating purposes \n[32]\n.\nE. Douvi et al. \n[33]\n reviewed technologies for solar energy storage using phase change materials (PCMs) to produce domestic hot water. Commonly studied PCMs have melting temperatures between 40 and 80 °C, including paraffins, fatty acids, salt hydrates, and alcohols. Solar collectors, such as flat plate or evacuated tubes, are used to harvest solar radiation, either commercially or modified. Storage units can consist of PCM alone or a hybrid with water. Adding PCMs increases heat release duration and solar collector efficiency, reducing temperature fluctuations. However, challenges arise in selecting appropriate storage materials with optimal melting temperatures and investigating the ideal water flow rate. Low thermal conductivity of PCMs is also a challenge, prompting performance-enhancing methods. For this purpose, the authors explored and reported on various methods for enhancing the performance of these systems. Pandey et al. \n[34]\n conducted a review of recent studies on SWHSs (SWHSs), both with and without the use of phase change materials (PCMs), from the perspective of energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and enviro-economic approaches. The review also highlighted the technical challenges that SWHSs face. The authors concluded that the incorporation of PCMs can enhance the exergy and energy efficiency of SWHSs. I. Harris et al. \n[35]\n provided a comprehensive review and discussion of recent advancements in the field of solar water heaters (SWHs) utilizing phase change materials (PCMs). The author identified the areas for further research, highlighted potential research opportunities, and proposed promising efforts to advance the maturity of SWHs with PCM technology. The focus is on addressing long-term performance, scalability, economic viability, and technical feasibility aspects in order to drive progress in this field. A. Y. Al-Rabeeah \n[36]\n explored the thermal efficiency of a compound parabolic trough solar collector (PTSC) by evaluating different absorber tube coatings. The study involves two identical PTSCs, each equipped with a distinct absorber coating: one with a matte coating (MC) and the other with a nanocoating (NC) incorporating Fe3O4 and graphene nanoparticles into the MC. Initially, a series of similarity tests were conducted on both collectors, employing the matte coating, and operating under identical conditions with a mass flow rate of 120 L/h. The results of these tests indicated that the average thermal efficiency of the collectors did not exceed 0.11 %. To further investigate the PTSC's performance, a comparison was made with various mass flow rates, including 30, 60, 90, and 120 L/h. The findings demonstrated that, at a flow rate of 120 L/h, the PTSC utilizing the nanocoating achieved a maximum heat removal factor of 52.72 %, while the one with the matte acrylic coating reached 50.33 %. Moreover, the maximum thermal efficiency at this flow rate was 41.58 % for the PTSC with the nanocoating, and 40.37 % for the PTSC with the matte acrylic coating. It was concluded that the addition of iron oxide and graphene nanoparticles to the matte acrylic coating resulted in improved radiation absorption, leading to enhanced optical and thermal efficiency of the PTSC. Kalair et al. \n[37]\n conducted a comprehensive analysis using the TRNSYS software to simulate an evacuated glass tube SWHS. Their study focused on determining the optimal configurations and sizes of key components, such as heat exchangers, solar collectors, and tank volumes, to achieve efficient yearly performance. Through their parametric analysis, they concluded that for a single-family dwelling's heating demands to be met effectively by the system, it should have a collector area of 6 m2 along with a tank volume and height of 0.42 m3 and 1.2 m, respectively. In addition, Al-Mamun et al. \n[38]\n conducted a comprehensive review on SWHSs which examines the design aspects of their major components, including the solar thermal collector, storage tank, heat exchanger, heat transfer fluid, and absorber plate. The analysis extends to recent research endeavors aimed at enhancing SWH systems and exploring their practical applications. Furthermore, the authors explored a relatively innovative concept within SWHSs, which is the utilization of nanofluids as heat transfer fluids in solar collectors, by assessing design criteria for advancing SWH technology.\nThe literature shows that although many studies have been conducted on SWHSs, few have provided a comprehensive review of the system and emphasized its economic and environmental benefits. In this context, the aim of this paper is to provide a detailed review of SWHSs, including their principles, components, classifications, and modes of operation. Additionally, recent research on SWHSs, as well as their advantages and disadvantages, will be reviewed. Moreover, a case study which exposes the great impact of this system economically and environmentally is implemented. The case study is conducted on Lebanon which compromises an economic and environmental analyses to demonstrate the benefits of using solar energy for water heating instead of electric heaters.\nThe novelty of this research lies in its diverse contributions. Firstly, it serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers by consolidating and summarizing the extensive body of work related to SWHSs. This detailed review offers a holistic perspective and captures the latest advancements in SWHSs. Additionally, the paper offers valuable case studies that can greatly benefit the SWH community. Furthermore, it conducts in-depth economic and environmental analyses of SWHSs, enabling a thorough investigation into the ramifications and potential advantages of their widespread adoption. The case study which offers an economic and environmental analyses adds a practical and real-world dimension to the work in which it provides concrete evidence of the system's benefits within a specific regional context.\n2. Principle of swh\nSWH is an innovative and efficient method that harnesses the power of solar radiation to generate thermal energy, specifically for the purpose of heating water \n[39]\n. This technology proves essential in various sectors such as industries, hostels, hospitals, and households. Extensive research studies have been conducted to explore and understand the intricate details of SWHSs \n[40]\n, \n[41]\n, \n[42]\n, \n[43]\n, \n[44]\n, \n[45]\n, \n[46]\n, \n[47]\n, \n[48]\n. These investigations delve into topics like thermal performance evaluation, identification of factors impacting system effectiveness, as well as optimization techniques aimed at achieving optimal performance. According to recent statistics, there has been a significant global increase in installed capacity for SWHS over the past decade. In 2010, a capacity of 160 GW was reported worldwide. Capacity then grew dramatically from 185 GW in 2011 \n[49]\n to 483 GW by the end of 2018 \n[50]\n.\nThe water heating system operates by utilizing a solar collector, which is a dark surface designed to absorb solar radiation and minimize heat loss [\n51\n,\n52\n]. This concept can be visualized in \nFig. 2\n of the provided schematic. The two main types of collectors used in SWHS are flat plate collectors \n[53]\n and evacuated tube collectors \n[54]\n. A flat plate collector consists of an absorber plate attached to fins or tubes that facilitate efficient heat transfer. Transparent glazing covers the entire structure, preventing heat from escaping while allowing sunlight to penetrate. On the other hand, an evacuated tube collector comprises a vacuum-sealed tube containing a heat pipe. Inside this structure, solar thermal energy is captured and then transferred through the heat pipe for further use. The fluid employed within SWHS can vary; it may either be water itself or a separate heat transfer fluid such as glycol/water mixture. In systems using plain water as the working medium, direct utilization occurs where heated water is utilized directly without any intermediate step involved. However, if another liquid serves as the working medium like glycol/water mixture, a separate process involves passing this solution through a heat exchanger before transferring its acquired temperature to regular tap water.\nFig 2\nDownload: Download high-res image (276KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 2. Schematic of principle of SWHS.\n\nA SWHS can be employed in various settings, including homes, hospitals, hotels, swimming pools, and gyms. These systems are relatively easy to construct and install, and their maintenance and operating costs are significantly lower compared to other types of solar systems.\n2.1. Components of SWHS\nWhen discussing SWHSs, it is important to understand the components that make up such a system. Typically, there are three primary components: the solar collector, storage tank, and heat transfer fluid. However, depending on the specific SWHS configuration, additional elements may be included such as piping units, heat exchangers, pumps, and auxiliary heating units. The solar collector serves as a specialized form of heat exchanger within an SWHS framework. Its main function is to absorb solar energy and convert it into thermal energy which can then be transferred to the working fluid circulating through the system - typically water, oil, or air. Amongst the different types of collectors frequently used in SWHS installations are flat plate collectors, evacuated tube collectors, and parabolic trough collectors.\nTo fully understand the functioning of a solar collector, it is essential to recognize the crucial role that the working fluid plays. Acting as a vital link between the collector and the water contained in the storage tank which requires heating, this fluid completes an intricate system. As heat energy is absorbed by the solar collector, it is transferred to this working fluid before being passed on to directly or indirectly warm up water within the storage tank via a heat exchanger. Careful consideration must be given when selecting a suitable heat transfer fluid for optimal performance. Factors such as high specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity, low viscosity, appropriate thermal expansion coefficient, cost-effectiveness, and anti-corrosive properties are considered during this selection process. Commonly employed options include water itself along with silicon oils, hydrocarbon oils, and glycol groups. Water proves favorable due to its affordability, availability, and thermal efficiency. However, it is important to note some drawbacks like its vulnerability towards freezing and potential corrosion issues.\nWithin SWHS, the storage tank plays a crucial role as the third major component. It can be seamlessly integrated with the solar collector or positioned separately above it. In certain systems, an insulated storage tank becomes necessary to effectively minimize any potential heat loss.\n2.2. Pros of SWHSs\nThe SWHS has gained significant attention and popularity worldwide due to its numerous advantages. One of the key benefits offered by SWHS is its ability to harness free and limitless energy from the sun for heating water. This not only provides a sustainable solution but also helps reduce energy bills associated with traditional methods of water heating. By lessening reliance on expensive conventional sources, consumers can save money on utility bills, which can contribute towards paying off the initial investment in installing an SWHS. Notably, once installed, SWHS requires minimal maintenance while boasting a longer lifespan compared to conventional heating systems. Additionally, it exhibits remarkable efficiency by utilizing up to 80 % of solar radiation for water heating purposes. In contrast to other photovoltaic solar systems that require substantial installation space, SWHS presents itself as a practical choice for homes and buildings with limited available space. From an environmental perspective, SWHSs play a crucial role in promoting sustainability through the utilization of clean and renewable energy sources. By harnessing the power of sunlight to heat water, SWHS significantly reduces our reliance on fossil fuels and consequently mitigates greenhouse gas emissions. This not only helps combat climate change but also contributes to improving air quality by minimizing pollution associated with conventional water heating methods.\n2.3. Cons of SWHSs\nDespite their numerous advantages in terms of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, these systems have drawbacks. The high initial investment and installation costs associated with a SWHS can pose a significant barrier for many individuals or businesses looking to adopt this technology. This cost factor may deter potential users from embracing SWH solutions. Additionally, the performance of SWHS is heavily reliant on weather conditions, particularly during cloudy, rainy, or foggy days. Such unfavorable weather conditions can reduce the system's overall efficiency or even render it non-operational at times. Consequently, backup heating systems become necessary to compensate for the absence of solar energy during these periods. Unfortunately, integrating additional heating sources not only increases the overall cost but also leads to higher energy bills. To ensure continuous supply of hot water even during unfavorable weather conditions or nighttime hours when no solar energy is available for heat generation, an insulated storage tank becomes imperative as part of a SWHS setup. This enables excess heated water generated throughout the day to be stored and used later when required. Furthermore, protective measures from overheating or freezing must be taken into account as well due to the rooftop installations of these systems.\n3. Classification of SWH\nSWHSs can be categorized in multiple ways \n[55]\n. In this comprehensive review, SWHS has been classified based on two key factors: the method of flow circulation within the system and the type of solar collector utilized. The first factor is related to how fluid circulates between the storage tank and solar collector. In passive systems, natural convection or gravity is employed to enable the movement of heated water from the collector to a storage tank located above it. On the other hand, active systems use pumps or fans to actively circulate fluid between these components. The second factor pertains to different types of solar collectors used in SWHS installations. These include flat plate collectors, which consist of an insulated box with a black absorber plate; evacuated tube collectors that house individual glass tubes containing metal heat-conductive fins; and parabolic trough collectors characterized by their curved reflective surfaces. \nFig. 3\n illustrates these classifications further [\n56\n,\n57\n].\nFig 3\nDownload: Download high-res image (242KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 3. Classifications of SWHS [\n56\n,\n57\n].\n\nIn order to examine recent developments in this field, Jamar et al. conducted a thorough analysis on SWHSs and notably concentrated on three crucial elements that have a substantial impact on the thermal performance of these systems \n[58]\n. The paper gave a thorough analysis of several SWH collector types, including concentrating collectors like parabolic dish reflectors and parabolic trough collectors as well as non-concentrating collectors like flat plate and evacuated tube collectors. Furthermore, Patel et al. \n[59]\n, Chaudhari et al. \n[60]\n, Tiwari et al. \n[61]\n, and Shelke et al. \n[62]\n have carried out their own independent reviews illuminating the current SWHS technologies and examining their wide-ranging applications.\n3.1. Method of flow circulation\nPassive SWHSs have distinct advantages over active systems, as they do not require pumps or moving parts to circulate the fluid between the storage tank and collector. This lack of mechanical components significantly reduces both installation costs and maintenance requirements. In contrast, active SWHSs rely on mechanical forces to ensure proper fluid circulation throughout the system \n[63]\n. These systems employ pumps, valves, and controllers to facilitate the movement of heat transfer fluid through the collector in what is known as forced circulation. While these active systems offer certain benefits such as enhanced control heat distribution control, their reliance on more complex technology makes them costlier to install and maintain compared to passive alternatives.\n3.1.1. Thermosiphon system\nThe thermosiphon system is a type of SWHS that operates based on natural convection \n[64]\n, \n[65]\n, \n[66]\n, \n[67]\n. It utilizes the principle that when water in the collector is heated by the sun, it expands and becomes less dense. This causes the cooler and denser water from the storage tank, which is located above the collector, to flow down towards the collector. Consequently, this downward flow forces hot water to rise into an insulated storage tank. To ensure smooth circulation of water within the system, a large-diameter pipe is employed to minimize friction as it facilitates movement driven primarily by small density differences between different parts of circulating liquid. Additionally, proper positioning plays a crucial role in preventing reverse motion of flow during nighttime occurrences by ensuring that there is around 30 cm distance between bottom position of the storage tank and the top part of the thermal collector. This configuration prevents cool-water backflow from entering the collectors at night while maintaining thermal stratification through separation A pressure-reducing valve may also be necessary if city supply lines are directly connected without any cold-water-storage tanks since direct connections can lead to excessively high pressures. \nFig. 4\n presents a schematic and an actual image of the thermosiphon system.\nFig 4\nDownload: Download high-res image (507KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 4. (a) Schematic and (b) Real image of thermosiphon system.\n\nThe thermosiphon system is widely recognized for its installation and maintenance cost-effectiveness and relatively high efficiency. However, it is important to acknowledge that impurities present in the water supply can lead to potential issues such as pipe clogging or corrosion within the collector. Additionally, from an aesthetic perspective, these systems may appear tall and unappealing. In a study conducted by Liu et al., eight thermosiphon SWHSs were installed in series with the objective of evaluating their thermal performance and temperature profiles under specific charge conditions \n[68]\n. The authors performed tests on the system under various load scenarios including no load, interrupted load, and continuous load conditions. The results obtained indicated that when subjected to interrupted loads, which involved periods without any active demand for hot water followed by bursts of usage requirements, there was a notable increase in thermal efficiency ranging between 5.8 % and 7 % compared to situations with no applied load.\n3.1.2. Integrated collector storage\nThe integrated collector storage system, also known as a batch system, functions similarly to the thermosiphon system \n[69]\n, \n[70]\n, \n[71]\n. However, there is one key distinction - the storage tank doubles as a collector in this setup. The storage tank is placed inside an insulated box that has one glazed side which allows solar radiation to warm up the tank. In their review paper, Singh et al. discussed recent advancements and developments related to integrated collector storage SWHSs \n[72]\n. One major drawback of this type of system is thermal losses experienced during nighttime hours, winter season or on days with cloudy skies and low ambient temperatures where less sunlight can be absorbed by the glazed surface of the box surrounding the tank itself. To better visualize this concept, \nFig. 5\n provides both a schematic diagram and an actual prototype model showcasing how an integrated collector storage system looks like.\nFig 5\nDownload: Download high-res image (386KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 5. (a) Schematic and (b) Real prototype of integrated collector storage \n[70]\n.\n\nAdvanced integrated collector storage systems are an innovative technology that enhances the performance of SWHSs. These systems utilize two tanks, with one tank being glazed and the other insulated to minimize heat losses. Additionally, some systems employ a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) installed on the glazed tank to further increase thermal efficiency when exposed to sunlight \n[73]\n. A numerical study conducted by Kessentini and Bouden examined the thermal performance of a specific type of double-tank integrated collector storage system incorporating a CPC \n[74]\n. The researchers implemented a prototype of this system and conducted experiments to validate their model's results. The experimental findings demonstrated that during daylight hours, there was a substantial rise in water temperature within the system due to efficient energy absorption from sunlight. Conversely, during nighttime periods, moderate water temperatures were preserved within the tanks.\n3.1.3. Open-loop system\nThe direct active SWHS operates by circulating water directly from the storage tank to the collector using a pump. The function of this open-loop system is illustrated in \nFig. 6\n. After being heated by solar energy, the water is returned to the storage tank for later use. It should be noted that both the collector and storage tank can be positioned either above or below each other depending on various factors. Typically, this type of system utilizes a single storage tank, although it can also be integrated with two-tank storage systems. Additionally, it has the flexibility to receive water from either a cold-water storage tank or directly from service water. However, if there is higher city-water pressure compared to its working pressure requirements, then incorporating pressure-reducing and pressure-relief valves becomes necessary. This design is cost effective and suitable for areas where freezing conditions are not permanent throughout the year but may occur seasonally. However, it cannot tolerate hard or acidic waters since they can cause corrosion and damage system components.\nFig 6\nDownload: Download high-res image (257KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 6. Open loop system.\n\n3.1.4. Closed-loop system\nThe closed-loop active system for heating potable water is designed to indirectly heat the water by circulating a heat transfer fluid through the collector. This heat transfer fluid, commonly a mixture of water and ethylene glycol, absorbs solar energy from the sun-exposed collector and transfers it to the water in the storage tank through a heat exchanger. \nFig. 7\n illustrates this closed-loop system configuration. In addition to using a water/ethylene glycol solution, alternative fluids such as silicone oils or refrigerants can also be utilized as the heat transfer medium. However, if toxic or non-potable fluids are employed in this process, it is necessary to incorporate a double-wall heat exchanger for safety reasons. Depending on specific requirements and constraints of each installation scenario, placement options for the heat exchanger include inside the storage tank itself, around its outer surface area, or externally connected but still part of the overall system design. To accommodate potential expansions due to temperature changes within these closed loops systems (especially pertinent in regions with extended freezing temperatures), an expansion tank along with pressure relief valves must be incorporated into their design. This ensures reliable operation while ensuring appropriate freeze protection properties.\nFig 7\nDownload: Download high-res image (309KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 7.

Flat plate collectors\nA flat plate collector is a type of solar collector that is commonly used in SWHSs, achieving water temperatures ranging from 40 °C up to 70 °C. It is designed to harness both direct and scattered sunlight, making it highly efficient. The main components of a flat plate collector include glazing, tubes, an absorber plate, a header, insulation, and casing. The glazing material allows up to 90 % of shortwave solar radiation to pass through while blocking long-wave radiation from the absorber plate. This helps minimize convection losses by preventing air from coming into contact with the absorber plate. The tubes in the collector are connected to large header tubes at both ends. These headers facilitate the transportation of heat transfer fluid from the inlet to the outlet. The primary function of the absorber plate is to absorb as much sunlight as possible and transfer this heat energy efficiently to the heat transfer fluid. Insulation materials surrounding these components help reduce any potential heat loss. Lastly, the casing serves as a protective frame for all these components against environmental factors such as dust and moisture.\nIn Al-Samawa city, Iraq, A. Al-Manea et al. \n[75]\n concentrated on the creation and testing of an active flat plate solar collector (FPSC) with an internal absorber tube receiver. The experimental site's ambient temperature was 39 °C, and 840 W/m2 of incoming solar radiation was present. This study updated the standard FPSC design, which consists of several riser tubes attached to headers and coated in a glass sheet. Instead, a single collector tube with a serpentine shape that was wrapped in plastic was employed. A smooth copper tube with an internal and external diameter of 9.5 mm and 12 mm, respectively, and a total length of 1000 mm was used to construct the solar collector. Using experimental data, a TRNSYS model was created, simulated, and validated. During the studies, temperature and flow rate data were gathered simultaneously to evaluate the effectiveness of the solar collector. The water flow rate was kept at 0.75 L/min, while the solar collector's intake temperature stayed steady at 37.7 °C. The findings revealed that the solar collector's outlet temperature varied from 52 °C to 61 °C, with an average of 58 °C. The proposed solar collector has an efficiency ranging from about 45 % to 67 %, with an average of 58 %. The experimental data and the simulation results from the TRNSYS model were in excellent agreement, with an average disagreement for temperature differential and collector efficiency of little under 1 %. Kalogirou et al. conducted a study to evaluate the energy performance of thermosiphon SWHSs using solar flat plate collectors \n[76]\n. They developed a new TRNSYS type and compared its simulation results with experimental data. The findings demonstrated that there was good agreement between the two, validating the accuracy of their developed model. In another research by Hashim et al., they experimentally investigated the performance of a SWHS equipped with a flat plate collector \n[77]\n. The study focused on evaluating different flow rates and their impact on achieving higher water temperatures. The results indicated that at a flow rate of 5.3 L/min, the maximum temperature reached was 51.4 °C while at 6.5 L/min it was slightly lower at 49 °C. Consequently, based on these studies, it can be concluded that for optimal performance in terms of attaining higher water temperatures, lower flow rates are favorable.\nThrough the use of a parallel tube configuration, T. R. Desisa \n[78]\n concentrated on experimentally examining the heat transfer properties of a solar flat-plate collector (SFPC) using Al2O3/water as the working fluid. The effectiveness of the SFPC was assessed using nanoparticles with mean diameters ranging from 15 to 50 nm and at various mass flow rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 kg/min). Additionally, using ANSYS Fluent 17.1 software, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used to numerically investigate steady and laminar flow in the SFPC while taking into account nanofluids (CuO/water, Ti2O/water, and Si2O/water) that were not tested in the trials. The author examined the coefficient of heat transfer, represented by the Nusselt number, for various nanofluids compared to the SFPC using water alone. At a mass flow rate of 0.2 kg/min, the Nusselt number increases by 4.1423 %, 3.3429 %, 3.3011 %, and 0.6887 % for 3 % volume concentration of CuO, Al2O3, Ti2O, and Si2O, respectively. CuO and Si2O nanoparticles exhibit the highest and lowest improvements, respectively, compared to other nanoparticles. Furthermore, the study indicated that the pressure drop remains negligible under all tested conditions. Sint et al. conducted a theoretical analysis to examine the efficiency of solar flat plate collectors that utilize nano-fluids \n[79]\n. The researchers developed a mathematical model and used a MATLAB code to calculate the efficiency of these collectors specifically designed for domestic hot water heating systems in a city located in Myanmar, taking into consideration local weather conditions. Their investigation revealed that the efficiency of solar flat plate collectors increases by approximately 2 % with each incremental increase in volume concentration of nanoparticles within the fluid. However, they noticed that nanoparticle size has only marginal influence on collector efficiency. Interestingly, when comparing working fluids, it was observed under identical ambient, operating, and radiant conditions that utilizing CuO-water nano-fluid led to an improvement of up to 5 % in collector efficiency compared to using plain water as the working fluid.\nFlat plate collectors are reasonably priced and have a minimal upfront cost. They are therefore an affordable choice for residential, commercial, and industrial applications—especially when long-term energy savings are taken into account. Besides, Flat plate collectors offer a relatively quick return on investment. Despite the fact that the initial installation cost may vary based on elements like size, quality, and installation requirements, the long-term energy savings produced by these collectors can quickly make up for the initial investment. Moreover, such collectors are also renowned for their durability and low maintenance requirements. With proper care, they frequently live for more than 20 years. This reduces the ongoing operational costs associated with repairs and maintenance. Furthermore, Flat plate collectors can be integrated into various systems, such as domestic hot water systems, space heating, and swimming pool heating. Their versatility allows for customization based on specific needs and applications, making them adaptable to distinct economic sectors.\n3.2.2. Evacuated tube collector\nAn evacuated tube collector is a highly efficient type of stationary solar collector commonly used in SWHSs. Unlike flat plate collectors, which are less efficient but cheaper, evacuated tube collectors can reach higher outlet temperatures ranging from 50 °C to 200 °C. This design consists of multiple parallel rows of glass tubes that are interconnected through a manifold system, as shown in \nFig. 9\n. Each individual tube in the collector contains a heat pipe filled with a small amount of liquid-vapor phase fluid, typically methanol. The heat pipe operates on the principle of continuous evaporation and condensation cycles. Attached to the heat pipe are black copper fins that absorb solar radiation and facilitate transferring thermal energy to the fluid inside. Upon absorbing sunlight, the fluid within each tube evaporates due to increased temperature and rises towards the top section of the pipe. At this point, it undergoes condensation by releasing its latent heat into the moving fluid present in the manifold.\nFig 9\nDownload: Download high-res image (368KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 9. Evacuated tube solar collector.\n\nIn a study conducted by Wannagosit et al., the researchers aimed to investigate an evacuated tube thermosiphon SWHS through both experimental and theoretical methods \n[80]\n. The authors developed a mathematical model for the system, which was validated using the thermal resistance method and explicit finite difference method. Based on their experiments, it was found that the SWHS exhibited a thermal efficiency of 58.3 %. Moreover, when comparing different analysis methods, they observed that the thermal resistance method yielded a slightly lower efficiency value of 56 %, while EFDM provided an efficiency value of 57.6 %. As such, it was concluded that EFDM is more accurate in predicting the performance of this particular SWHS than the traditional thermal resistance method.\nFeliński and Sekret conducted a study to assess the impact of incorporating phase change material (PCM) into evacuated tube collectors on the operational characteristics of SWHSs. They proposed a systematic approach to evaluate the thermal performance of an evacuated tube collector combined with PCM storage. The results indicated that utilizing PCM in conjunction with the evacuated tube collector led to a significant improvement in the annual solar fraction of domestic hot water systems, showing a remarkable increase by 20.5 % compared to using only an evacuated tube collector without any storage system.\nTo assess the effectiveness of a SWHS using an evacuated tube collector, Daghigh and Shafieian conducted a thorough analysis \n[81]\n. In their research, they created a system prototype for experimental testing in addition to a mathematical model based on thermal and energy analysis. The ideal number of collection pipes in this configuration, according to the researchers, is 15. In addition, they noted that under perfect circumstances, the collector's maximum water temperature may reach 64 °C. The authors contrasted the predictions with the outcomes of their practical experiments in order to validate their theoretical model. The validation process demonstrated that their mathematical model is capable of accurately predicting the performance characteristics of heat pipe solar water heaters, exhibiting maximum relative error percentage as low as 8.4 % and standard error percentage at around 1.91 %.\nIn \n[82]\n, Shafieian et al. conducted a comprehensive analysis, both theoretical and experimental, to evaluate the performance of evacuated tube heat pipe SWHSs specifically during cold seasons. Their study included the development of a mathematical model that was used to determine the optimal number of glass tubes required for an efficient collector. They designed, constructed, and tested a 25-glass tube collector to obtain experimental data. The findings revealed that one crucial factor affecting the overall performance of the SWHS is hot water extraction. It was observed that how hot water is extracted significantly impacts key metrics such as exergy efficiency and thermal efficiency. The results obtained from their experimentation indicated that achieving an exergy efficiency value as high as 15.58 % along with a remarkable thermal efficiency value of 92.7 % are possible outcomes with this type of solar collector.\nThrough the application of various nanofluids and carefully managed mechanical stimulation, A. A. Eidan et al. \n[83]\n reported a parametric investigation designed to improve the thermal performance of a solar-evacuated tube collector embedded with a heat pipe (SETCsingle bondHP). Six SETCsingle bondHP configurations that were exactly alike and operated under the same circumstances were used in the experiment, with one setup containing only pure acetone serving as a reference. Al2O3 and CuO nanofluids with a 0.5 % volume concentration were used in the second and third settings, respectively. To study the effect of vibration on thermal performance, the remaining three setups were altered by applying controlled mechanical excitation at various frequencies (27–82 Hz). The outcomes showed that mechanical vibration pulses at 82 Hz produced the biggest increase in efficiency, with improvements of 91 % and 86 % for Al2O3-based acetone and CuO-based acetone, respectively. With sun intensity and vibration, the effective heat transfer coefficient (EHTC) and convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) enhancement percentages changed. For Al2O3 and CuO (0.5 % volume) acetone-based nanofluids, the increases ranged from 26 % to 160 % and 5 % to 60 % for EHTC, respectively, and 6.5 % to 140 % and 6.5 % to 54 % for CHTC. In the case of pure acetone, the gains ranged from 5 % to 82 % for EHTC and 3 % to 53 % for CHTC. The thermal efficiency improvement of an evacuated tube solar collector (ETSC) was experimentally explored by E. Elshazly et al. \n[84]\n utilizing a variety of working fluids, including multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and a hybrid MWCNT/Al2O3 50:50 mixture. The researchers investigated three different mass flow rates and four volume concentration percentages (0.5 %, 0.025 %, 0.01 %, and 0.005 %) for each nanofluid. According to the results, utilizing a hybrid MWCNT/Al2O3 50:50 mixture increased efficiency by 20 % when compared to using Al2O3 alone, as had previously been reported. The ETSC's energy and exergy efficiency specifically attained 73.5 % and 51 % while employing a 0.5 % MWCNT/water nanofluid at a mass flow rate of 3.5 L/m. Under the same test conditions, using AL2O3 produced results of around 60 % energy efficiency and 44 % exergy efficiency, whereas using a hybrid MWCNT/Al2O3 mixture (50:50) produced results of about 69 % energy efficiency and 38 % exergy efficiency.\nIn capturing solar energy, evacuated tube collectors are renowned for their great efficiency. Even in colder areas or on overcast days, the collectors may reach greater temperatures because to the vacuum insulation's reduction of heat loss. Over time, this elevated efficiency results in improved energy output and cost savings. Besides, although evacuated tube collectors may have a higher upfront cost compared to other solar thermal technologies, their superior efficiency and energy production result in a relatively quick return on investment. Long-term financial gains may result from the energy savings gained over time, which may balance the original cost. Moreover, Evacuated tube collectors are built to last and have an extended lifespan of at least 25 years. In comparison to some other solar technologies, they are built with high-quality materials to resist a variety of weather conditions and are less prone to damage. Their durability lessens the requirement for frequent replacements or repairs, which lowers the cost of maintenance. Additionally, these collectors may be deployed in domestic, commercial, or industrial settings and incorporated into a variety of systems, including space heating and hot water systems. Customization is possible depending on the economic requirements of various industries thanks to this flexibility.\n3.2.3. Parabolic trough collector\nUtilizing solar energy to heat water through the use of a parabolic trough collector is a highly advanced solar technology, capable of producing heat up to 400 °C. The collector is comprised of a reflective material that has been shaped into a parabola and angled towards the sun. It also features a receiver that contains a black glazed metal tube positioned along its focal line. To minimize convective losses, the space between the receiver and the glass cover is evacuated. When the sun's rays hit the parabola, they are reflected onto the receiver, where a working fluid flows through. The heated working fluid then transfers its heat to the water, which can be used for various purposes. A schematic and a real image of a parabolic trough collector are illustrated in \nFig. 10\n.\nFig 10\nDownload: Download high-res image (454KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 10. (a) Schematic and (b) Real image of parabolic trough collector.\n\nS. Chantasiriwan \n[85]\n used models of thermal power plants, parabolic trough collectors, oil-water heat exchangers, and feed water heaters to compare the power outputs obtained by integrating solar feed water heating systems into a thermal power plant. The results of a numerical analysis done on a case study of a 50-MW power plant show that the total heating surface area of the first system needs to be increased by about 3.48 % in comparison to the second system's in order for both systems to produce the same amount of power. Additionally, if the total heating surface area of both systems is the same, the second system can produce up to 0.26 % more electricity than the first system. Through the use of various absorber tube designs, A. Y. Al-Rabeeah \n[86]\n carried out an experimental investigation to improve the thermal efficiency of a parabolic trough solar collector (PTSC) system. A single evacuated absorber tube, a double evacuated absorber tube, a loop evacuated absorber tube, and a double evacuated absorber tube with a flat plate were all created and tested. All four receiver tubes were made of copper. To examine how well these absorber tubes performed in Hungarian weather, two PTSC models were created and tested. A similarity test was performed before the experiment to make sure that both collectors would produce reliable findings. The similarity test findings showed that the lower and higher collectors' average efficiencies were 39.798 % and 39.842 %, respectively. These results verified that the two collectors' performance was equivalent. Further investigation revealed that the greatest heat removal factor for the double evacuated absorber tube with a flat plate was reached at mass flow rates of 60 and 120 L/h, corresponding to roughly 73.478 % and 65.7048 %, respectively. Furthermore, at flow rates of 60 and 120 L/h, the maximum thermal efficiency of the PTSC outfitted with the double-evacuated absorber tube and flat plate was found to be 52.7 % and 59.05 %, respectively. In conclusion, the study showed that, regardless of the mass flow rate, the thermal performance of the PTSC can be greatly improved by using loop-evacuated and double-evacuated absorbers with flat plates. These new absorber tube designs outperformed conventional tubes, demonstrating their potential to raise PTSC systems' general efficiency.\nRamadan et al. conducted a study to develop and test a prototype of a new heating water design using a parabolic trough with a solar tracking system \n[87]\n. They aimed to evaluate the performance of the system under different weather conditions. The experimental results showed that by utilizing a parabolic trough collector measuring 0.6 m2, the temperature of the water could be increased from an initial value of 23 °C up to 57 °C without activating the tracking system. However, when they activated the solar tracking system, temperatures as high as 69 °C were achieved. Additionally, Khaled et al. carried out theoretical and case studies on another novel residential water heating design employing parabolic troughs \n[88]\n. In their investigation, they compared this type of collector with flat plate collectors for efficiency analysis purposes. Their findings revealed that, when considering constant volume requirements, the time needed to heat water up to 70 °C is minimized by 33 % and 22.4 % when using parabolic trough with and without tracking, respectively.\nIn addition to the findings presented earlier, Zou et al. conducted a study on a compact parabolic trough collector and thoroughly analyzed its properties through experimental analysis and testing \n[84]\n. The researchers observed that the collector exhibited good performance even under low solar radiation conditions of less than 310 W/m2, with a thermal efficiency reaching up to 67 %. Notably, it was also found that maximum attained efficiencies were 26 % and 56 % during frosting and at 5 m/s wind velocity, respectively.\nHigh optical efficiency is a well-known characteristic of parabolic trough collectors. High temperatures and effective energy conversion are produced as a result of the curved mirrors' concentration of sunlight toward limited area. When compared to other solar thermal collectors, this high efficiency permits a higher energy output, which increases energy production and may result in cost savings. Additionally, parabolic trough collectors may be sized up or down to accommodate different energy needs. They can be installed into either utility-scale power facilities or smaller distributed systems. This scalability enables flexibility in the design of solar thermal systems that suit the financial requirements and energy requirements of various sectors. While parabolic trough collectors may have higher upfront costs compared to some other solar collectors, they offer long-term financial benefits. With proper maintenance, these collectors have a long lifespan, typically exceeding 25 years. Over time, a return on investment may be possible due to the energy cost reductions and potential income from power generation or process heat. Furthermore, parabolic trough collectors are a well-established technology with a proven track record. This maturity leads to lower risks associated with performance and reliability, making them attractive from an economic perspective. Processes for installation and maintenance are more affordable because of the industry's well-established supply networks and skilled labor.\n4.

CASE study in lebanon\nFor years, Lebanon has been grappling with meeting the energy needs of its people \n[158]\n. Specifically, in 2009, the country's electricity demand reached 2300 MW while its primary electricity provider, EDL, is continuously attempting to deliver a maximum power output of 1500 MW \n[159]\n. As a result, the country's sustained electricity production and its ever-growing population have made it impossible to fulfill the energy requirements. According to Yathreb \n[160]\n, by the year 2030, Lebanon's energy demand is projected to increase to 250 % of the energy consumption in 2010.\nAccording to a pie chart presented in \nFig. 11\n \n[161]\n, electricity consumption in Lebanon is dominated by heating and water heating, which accounts for 30 % and 21 % of total consumption, respectively. Given the persistent electricity deficit in Lebanon, this high demand for water heating could be met by investing in solar energy. Therefore, the implementation of SWHS could be a viable solution for the electricity crisis in Lebanon. This would not only help address the country's energy shortfall but also promote energy savings, leading to economic and environmental benefits.\nFig 11\nDownload: Download high-res image (176KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 11. Electricity consumption in Lebanon \n[161]\n.\n\nThe forthcoming sections of this document will present economic and environmental analyses to highlight the importance of utilizing solar heating systems for water heating in Lebanon.\n5.1. Economic study\nMartinopoulos and Tsalikis \n[162]\n carried out an in-depth analysis of a standard solar heating system for both space and water, taking into consideration the four climate conditions outlined by Greek regulations. The evaluation encompassed technical, economic, and environmental aspects of the system.\nA study is being conducted to assess the economic impact of using solar energy for water heating and to determine the payback period for a typical SWHS based on the cost of the system and the savings it can generate. The study is specifically focused on Lebanon and will consider various scenarios of different sizes, including households with 4, 6, and 8 members, schools with 400, 850, and 1200 pupils, restaurants serving 25, 60, and 150 patrons, four-star hotels with 50, 100, and 200 beds, and gyms with 30, 50, and 100 members. By evaluating the amount of money saved through the use of SWHS instead of electric heaters, the study aims to highlight the importance of solar energy in water heating and the potential economic benefits of adopting this technology.\n5.1.1. Saved money\nTo determine the monthly energy consumption required to heat water to 60 °C, \nequations (1)\n and \n(2)\n can be utilized:\n(1)\n(2)\nIn the above equations, \n and \n (kJ/month) represent summer and winter amounts of energy needed for water heating, respectively, Ndays = 30 is the days per month, m = ρ.V is the water mass which is equal to the product of the water density (ρ=1000 kg/m3) and its volume (V in m3), Cp=4.1855 kJ/kg.K is the specific heat of water, Tout = 60°C is the outlet water temperature which is equal \n[163]\n, \n=28°C and \nare the inlet water temperatures during summer and winter, respectively \n[164]\n, and η=80 % is the efficiency of the electric heater \n[165]\n.\n(3)\nwhere ρ is the density of water which is 1000 kg/m3 and V is the volume of water. The daily amount of hot water needed for each scenario is presented in \nTable 3\n, measured in L/day \n[166]\n.\nTable 3. Amount of HW demand for each scenario \n[166]\n.\n\nType of HW costumer\tHW demand (L/day)\nFamily\t30 L/person\nSchool\t3 L/person\nRestaurant\t8 L/service\nHotel\t70 L/bed\nGym\t20 L/person\nAfter evaluating the energy needed for water heating in both summer and winter, the cost of this energy is determined using \nequations (4)\n and \n(5)\n:\n(4)\n(5)\nwhere \n and \n are the monthly price of energy consumed ($/month) during summer and winter and P1kWh is the price of one kilowatt hour. \nTable 4\n illustrates the price of kWh in Lebanon.\nTable 4. Price of kWh in Lebanon \n[167]\n.\n\nRange\tPrice ($)\nBelow 100 kWh\t0.023\n100–300 kWh\t0.040\n300–400 kWh\t0.053\n400–500 kWh\t0.080\nAbove 500 kWh\t0.133\nTo evaluate the amount of money saved when utilizing SWHS, \nequation (6)\n can be utilized.\n(6)\nwhere SMyear is the amount of annual saved money ($/year) and Pr is the percentage of time during when SWHS is utilized. \n and \n are the number of summer and winter months per year. It is assumed that there are six summer and six winter months per year.\nFig. 12\n shows the changes in financial savings for families of 4, 6, and 8 people. It is clear that the amount of money saved increases linearly with the size of the family and the Pr value. The annual savings for families of 4, 6, and 8 people in a moderately efficient scenario with Pr equal to 0.6 are around $48, $81, and $127, respectively. The annual amount of money saved for families of 4, 6, and 8 people, respectively, doubles to $71, $121, and $190 in a highly efficient case when Pr is 0.9. Additionally, for households of 4, 6, and 8 people, the average annual saved money ratio is $10.8, $12.3, and $14.5 per person, respectively. As a result, a family's average annual savings is about $12.5 for each member.\nFig 12\nDownload: Download high-res image (185KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 12. Variation of saved money for family of 4, 6 and 8 persons.\n\nFig. 13\n illustrates the correlation between the number of pupils and the amount of money that can be saved through the use of SWHSs. As shown on the graph, there is a positive relationship between these variables; as more efficient systems are employed (with Pr values increasing from 0.6 to 0.9), greater amounts of money are saved annually for schools with varying numbers of pupils. For instance, in schools with 400, 850, and 1200 pupils, when transitioning from moderately efficient cases (Pr = 0.6) to highly efficient cases (Pr = 0.9), annual savings increase from $1073, $2412, and $3453 to $1609, $3618, and $5180, respectively. Additionally, noteworthy is that on average each pupil at these respective school sizes would save approximately $2.5, $2.6, and $2.7 per year, respectively thus indicating an overall yearly saving per student estimated around $2.6.\nFig 13\nDownload: Download high-res image (192KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 13. Variation of saved money for school of 400, 850 and 1200 pupils.\n\nFig. 14\n depicts the fluctuation in accumulated financial benefits across restaurants providing 25, 60, and 150 services. The findings highlight a direct correlation between the amount of accrued savings and these two variables. For instance, in a scenario of moderate efficiency characterized by a 60 % reliance on SWHSs (SWHS), the yearly cost reduction stands at $81, $359, and $1073 for establishments catering to 25, 60, and 150 services, respectively. However, elevating SWHS usage to 90 % results in an increase of the annual savings to $121, $538, and $1609 for the respective service capacities. Furthermore, the mean ratio of annual savings per service amounts to $2.9, $5.5, and $6.6 for venues offering 25, 60, and 150 services, signifying an average annual savings of approximately $5 per service.\nFig 14\nDownload: Download high-res image (157KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 14. Variation of saved money for restaurant of 25, 60 and 150 services.\n\nThe cost savings for four-star hotels with 50, 100, and 200 beds are shown in several ways in \nFig. 15\n. For hotels with 50, 100, and 200 beds, respectively, the annual savings grow from $3,354 to $5,031, $6,826 to $10,239, and $13,770 to $20,655 as the efficiency coefficient (Pr) rises from 0.6 to 0.9. This emphasizes the link between higher bed capacity and improved SWHS efficiency. In addition, the average annual savings per bed for hotels with 50, 100, and 200 beds, respectively, is $61.5, $62.6, and $63.1, indicating an average annual savings per bed of roughly $62.4.\nFig 15\nDownload: Download high-res image (185KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 15. Variation of saved money for hotel of 50, 100 and 200 beds.\n\nFig. 16\n graphically presents the variations in savings for fitness centers accommodating 30, 50, and 100 individuals. Elevating Pr from 0.6 (moderate efficiency) to 0.9 (high efficiency) correlates with an augmented annual savings from $478 to $796, $874 to $1457, and $1866 to $3110 for gyms accommodating 30, 50, and 100 individuals, respectively. This establishes a direct connection between participant count and Pr's impact on heightened savings through SWHS utilization. Correspondingly, the mean annual savings per person stands at $14.6, $16.0, and $17.1 for fitness centers housing 30, 50, and 100 individuals, respectively, reflecting an average per-person annual savings of approximately $15.9.\nFig 16\nDownload: Download high-res image (191KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 16.

Payback period\nBecause the thermosiphon system is the predominant type of SWHS used in Lebanon, it will be the focus of this analysis. As a result, \nequation (7)\n will be employed to calculate the payback period of this system.\n(7)\nwhere Pbp is the payback period (month) and \n is the total cost of SWHS ($). \n is calculated using \nequation (8)\n.\n(8)\nwhere CSWHS is the cost of specific type of SWHS and  NSWHS is the number of SWHS required, computed from \nequation (9)\n.\n(9)\nwhere Size is the size of SWHS.\nTable 5\n illustrates the sizes and costs of SWHS in Lebanon and \nTable 6\n shows the number, type and total cost of SWH systems required for each case.\nTable 5.

According to \nequation (7)\n, it is clear that there is an inverse relationship between payback duration and money saved. Additionally, the size of the household and the solar percentage (Pr) have a direct impact on how much money is saved. As a result, increased solar usage and household size result in shorter payback times. Payback durations for families with 4, 6, and 8 people, respectively, are roughly 18.3 years, 14.1 years, and 10 years under a moderately efficient scenario (Pr = 60 %). These times, however, are reduced to roughly 12.2, 9.4, and 6.7 years for the corresponding household sizes when Pr is 90 %. Therefore, for moderate solar utilization, the average payback period for families using SWHS is 14.2 years, whereas under high usage, it is 9.5 years.\nFig 17\nDownload: Download high-res image (181KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 17. Variation of payback period for family of 4, 6 and 8 persons.\n\nFig. 18\n illustrates the variability of payback periods across schools with enrollments of 400, 850, and 1200 students. Evidently, an inverse relation exists between payback period and the extent of SWHS utilization. Moreover, the payback period remains relatively consistent across the three enrollment scenarios. For instance, when Pr equals 0.6, payback periods hover around 4.7 years for schools with 400 and 850 students, and 4.4 years for those with 1200 students. Upon increasing SWHS reliance (Pr = 0.9), payback periods reduce to around 3.2 years for schools with 400 and 850 students, and 2.9 years for those with 1200 students. Consequently, amplified SWHS adoption results in shorter payback periods irrespective of student count. The mean payback period for SWHS adoption in a school is about 4.6 years for moderate utilization and 3.1 years for high utilization.\nFig 18\nDownload: Download high-res image (169KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 18. Variation of payback period for school of 400, 850 and 1200 pupils.\n\nFig. 19\n shows the variations in payback period for restaurants catering to 25, 60, and 150 services. Notably, payback periods decline with increasing Pr, moving from 15.8 to 10.5 years, 7.1 to 4.7 years, and 4.7 to 3.2 years for restaurants with 25, 60, and 150 services, respectively. This underscores Pr's direct influence in shortening payback periods when SWHS is integrated. Consequently, higher SWHS efficiency translates to shorter payback periods. Moreover, the mean payback period for SWHS integration in a restaurant is approximately 9.2 years under moderate efficiency and 6.1 years under high efficiency.\nFig 19\nDownload: Download high-res image (180KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig 19. Variation of payback period for restaurant of 25, 60 and 150 services.\n\nFig. 20\n captures the variation in payback periods for hotels featuring 50, 100, and 200 beds. Notably, payback periods decrease in tandem with elevated Pr values, while bed count doesn't significantly affect payback period variations. For instance, payback periods for Pr = 0.6 are approximately 4.5, 4.4, and 4.3 years for hotels with 50, 100, and 200 beds, respectively. With Pr = 0.9, payback periods decrease to about 3.0, 2.9, and 2.8 years for the respective bed counts. Thus, payback periods in hotels are primarily influenced by Pr rather than bed count. The average payback period for SWHS integration in a hotel is about 4.4 years under moderate utilization and 2.9 years under high utilization.\nFig 20\nDownload: Download high-res image (154KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 20. Variation of payback period for hotel of 50, 100 and 200 beds.\n\nFig. 21\n illustrates the relation between payback periods and SWHS utilization percentage for fitness centers accommodating 30, 50, and 100 individuals. The outcomes affirm that increased SWHS utilization percentages lead to decreased payback periods. Specifically, for fitness centers with 30 individuals, payback periods drop from 5.3 to 3.5 years as Pr elevates from 0.6 to 0.9. Similarly, for fitness centers with 50 individuals, payback periods decrease from 5.8 to 3.9 years, and for those with 100 individuals, payback periods decrease from 4.8 to 3.2 years in the same Pr range. Additionally, the mean payback period for SWHS adoption in a fitness center is approximately 5.3 years under moderate utilization and 3.5 years under high utilization.\nFig 21\nDownload: Download high-res image (186KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 21.

Environmental study\nKoroneos and Namaki undertook an investigation employing life cycle assessment to evaluate the technical and ecological consequences of solar water heaters \n[169]\n. The study encompassed an array of environmental implications, including greenhouse gas effects, ozone layer depletion, acidification, eutrophication, heavy metal presence, carcinogenic substances, winter smog, and summer smog. Their findings revealed that acidification constituted the foremost environmental influence, contributing to 54 % of the impact, followed by winter smog at 25 %. The impact associated with CO2-induced global warming stood at 12 %, ranking third, whereas the remaining ecological impacts held a smaller contribution of 9 %. Furundzic et al. identified the advantages associated with utilizing SWHS instead of conventional water heating systems reliant on fuel oil, electricity, or gas \n[170]\n. Bessa and Prado estimated the potential reduction in carbon dioxide emissions when implementing SWHS as opposed to electric showers in social dwellings across diverse climatic zones in Brazil \n[171]\n.\nA comprehensive examination was conducted in Lebanon to gauge the environmental implications of SWHS. The study encompassed quantifying the monthly carbon dioxide emissions stemming from electric water heater use and subsequently appraising the potential reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that would be realized through the adoption of SWHS in lieu of the electric heater. The central aim of the study was to showcase the advantages of incorporating solar energy for water heating, specifically highlighting its positive environmental impact.\nThe annual amount of CO2 produced can be calculated from \nequation (10)\n.\n(10)\nwhere \n is the annual amount of CO2 produced (ton/year) and \n is the amount of CO2 produced from 1 kWh electricity. In Lebanon it is estimated to be about 0.47 kg CO2/1 kWh \n[165]\n . Qyear is the annual amount of consumed energy (kJ/year) which is calculated using \nequation (11)\n.\n(11)\nThe annual amount of reduced CO2 emissions can be computed using the following equation:\n(12)\nwhere \n is the annual amount of CO2 reduced (ton/year).\nIllustrated in \nFig. 22\n is the yearly decline in CO2 emissions for households with varying sizes, encompassing 4, 6, and 8 occupants. The graph displays a positive and distinct correlation between the extent of SWHS utilization and the volume of mitigated CO2 emissions, as well as the relationship between family size and the degree of CO2 reduction. To illustrate, as the Pr value goes from 0.6 to 0.9, the annual CO2 mitigation for households with 4, 6, and 8 individuals increases from 0.7 to 1.0, 1.0 to 1.6, and 1.4 to 2.1 tons per year, respectively. Additionally, the proportion of annual CO2 emission reduction per family member stands at 0.17 tons in the context of moderately efficient SWHS and rises to 0.26 tons for highly efficient SWHS. Furthermore, the mean annual reduction in CO2 emissions per individual within a family utilizing SWHS amounts to 0.16 tons.\nFig 22\nDownload: Download high-res image (224KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 22. Variation of amount of CO2 reduced for family of 4, 6 and 8 persons.\n\nFig. 23\n exhibits the annual reduction in CO2 emissions for educational institutions featuring 400, 850, and 1200 students. With an increase in Pr from 0.6 to 0.9, the annual CO2 reduction goes from 7.0 to 10.5 tons, 14.9 to 22.3 tons, and 21.0 to 31.5 tons for schools accommodating 400, 850, and 1200 students, correspondingly. This underscores the direct correlation between the volume of CO2 reduction and both Pr and the student count. Consequently, in scenarios of moderate and high efficiency, the proportion of yearly mitigated CO2 emissions per student within a school is 0.017 tons and 0.026 tons, respectively. Furthermore, the mean annual CO2 reduction per student in schools implementing SWHS is approximately 0.016 tons.\nFig 23\nDownload: Download high-res image (238KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 23.

The CO2 reduction scales up from 1.2 to 1.7 tons, 2.8 to 4.2 tons, and 7.01 to 10.5 tons annually for restaurants providing 25, 60, and 150 meals, sequentially, with the augmentation of Pr from 0.6 to 0.9. Evidently, both Pr and the service count exert a direct influence on the magnitude of CO2 reduction attained through the adoption of SWHS over electric heating. Furthermore, the relationship between the yearly reduction in CO2 emissions and the number of services rendered in a restaurant is 0.05 tons per service for moderately efficient SWHS and 0.07 tons per service for highly efficient SWHS. Additionally, the mean annual CO2 reduction when SWHS is adopted in a restaurant stands at around 0.04 ton per service.\nFig 24\nDownload: Download high-res image (225KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nFig. 24.

Conclusions\nSolar energy is a type of energy that can be renewed and has a significant impact on both humans and the environment. One of the most efficient ways to utilize solar energy is through SWHSs, especially because hot water is a necessary resource in public buildings such as schools, hotels, and restaurants. By utilizing thermal solar energy to provide hot water, this application can help alleviate some of the current issues surrounding the depletion of fossil fuels and the resulting economic and environmental disasters.\nWith a brief explanation of each type's operation mode, this study gave a succinct review of SWHS, including its concepts, components, and classifications. It also provided an overview of earlier research on SWHS and discussed the benefits and drawbacks of implementing such a system. In order to assess the advantages of utilizing SWHS instead of electric heaters, economic and environmental analyses were done, as well as special attention was paid to the electricity situation in Lebanon.\nIn Lebanon, where Pr ranged from 0.1 to 1, an economic analysis was done to establish the payback period for various scenarios. The scenarios comprised 4, 6, and 8-person families, 400, 850, and 1200-student schools, 25, 60, and 150-seat restaurants, 50, 100, and 200-bed hotels, and 30, 50, and 100-person gyms. The findings revealed an antagonistic link between payback period and Pr. Average payback periods were determined to be 14.2 years and 9.5 years for families, 4.6 years and 3.1 years for schools, 9.2 years and 6.1 years for restaurants, 4.4 years and 2.9 years for hotels, and 5.3 years and 3.5 years for gyms, respectively, for moderate and high SWHS usage.\nThe environmental analysis concentrated on how using SWHS will affect carbon dioxide emissions in different contexts, such as homes, schools, restaurants, hotels, and gyms. It was discovered that SWHS significantly contributes to lowering carbon dioxide emissions and that there is a connection between Pr and the decrease in CO2 generation. The annual CO2 reduction was found to be approximately 0.17 tons per person and 0.26 tons per person in families, 0.017 tons per pupil and 0.026 tons per pupil in schools, 0.05 tons per service and 0.07 tons per service in restaurants, 0.41 tons per bed and 0.61 tons per bed in hotels, and 0.12 tons per person and 0.17 tons per person in gyms. Therefore, by utilizing SWHS, the average annual amount of CO2 mitigated in families, schools, restaurants, hotels, and gyms is estimated to be 0.16 ton/person, 0.016 ton/pupil, 0.04 ton/service, 0.37 ton/bed, and 0.11 ton/person, respectively.\nThis paper provided a thorough analysis of the impact of SWHS on the economy, the environment, and human health. The findings suggest that SWHS has a significant positive effect on all these areas. Therefore, it is expected that the adoption of SWHS will become a priority and will gain popularity not only in Lebanon but also around the world.\nAs part of future research endeavors, it is advisable to carry out case studies in regions with climates distinct from that of Lebanon. These studies can shed light on how climate variations impact economic and environmental aspects. Moreover, there is a need to incorporate parametric analyses, exposing the effects of various parameters on the system performance. These parameters mainly comprise factors such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature, collector tilt and orientation, type and design of the system, heat transfer fluid, storage tank size, insulation, system size, etc. Furthermore, the results of the parametric analysis can be validated by conducting experimental setups. Also, the exploration of the integration of solar water heating systems with other renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, to develop hybrid systems that enhance energy generation and reliability should be a subject of investigation.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nData availability\nThe authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used.\n\"\"\"\n\nwhen you're done compiling the evidence from these papers let's redo the calculations and then let's create the output as if they were going to be a few slides in a training presentation on solar energy helping create the evidence for the use of solar water heaters in Iraq ",

The goal is to craft a training presentation on solar energy, ensuring precision with accurate data.\n\nFocusing on the relevant paper, \"The Use of Solar Water Heaters in Iraq: An Economic Study\" by Wael H. Hamdon, Mahmoud U. Jasim, and Majid S. M. Al-Hafidh.\n\n**Exploring solar energy**\n\nI’m thinking through the influence of solar water heaters on residential energy consumption. Their potential to cut electricity use and boost savings makes them both economical and beneficial. Progressing through the analysis, I see promising trends in energy efficiency.\n\n**Adjusting for enhancements**\n\nIt’s becoming clear that using solar water heaters reduced the residential electrical load for water heating in Iraq from 32.29% to 13.1%, resulting in a significant 19.19 percentage point decrease.\n\n**Assessing savings**\n\nI analyzed the annual electricity consumption before and after the installation of solar water heaters (SWH) for three consumer groups with different consumption levels, showing significant savings and reductions in water heating costs.\n\n**Calculating energy usage**\n\nI'm laying out consumption brackets and kWh rates, then figuring out annual bills with and without the solar water heater (SWH), focusing on savings and payback time.\n\n**Evaluating tariffs and savings**\n\nI’m reviewing electricity tariffs with consumption levels ranging from low to very high, and comparing annual bills with and without solar water heaters. The payback periods vary based on consumption levels.\n\n**Assessing payback periods**\n\nIraq's electricity tariff increases with consumption, leading to varied payback periods. Solar water heaters reduce electricity usage, potentially lowering bills and meeting a larger portion of hot water needs. Progressing towards factoring in annual energy consumption data.\n\n**Revisiting consumption figures**\n\nI’m noting the three consumption levels: high, medium, and low, ranging from 14,695 to 40,441 kWh/year. These values appear higher than previous estimates, suggesting the previous calculations might have underestimated actual consumption.\n\n**Revisiting energy estimates**\n\nOK, let me see. Reassessing per capita electricity consumption in Iraq from the paper's data to accurately gauge economic benefits from installing solar water heaters, considering their switch to water heating.\n\n**Calculating energy savings**\n\nI’m determining the annual electricity consumption and cost with and without solar water heaters (SWH). Then, I’ll calculate the savings percentage and payback period to present a compelling case for their adoption in a training presentation.\n\n**Highlighting household energy**\n\nI’m focusing on how much energy households in Iraq use for water heating (32.29%), their overall energy expenditure, and potential savings from solar water heaters, including payback periods and broader economic and environmental benefits.\n\n**Setting the stage**\n\nI’m working through the economic benefits of solar water heaters in Iraq, given the nation’s high electricity demand and frequent shortages. It’s crucial to explore solutions that reduce household power use.",
