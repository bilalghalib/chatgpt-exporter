      "content": "Yes, the Qur’an contains multiple verses expressing the idea that people are only punished or suffer due to the wrongs they themselves commit. This reflects the principle of **divine justice** in Islam — that individuals are not wronged by God, but rather suffer the consequences of their own choices.\n\nHere are a few key verses that convey this concept:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Surah An-Nisa (4:79)**\n> **\"Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself.\"**  \n> _**مَّا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ ٱللَّهِۖ وَمَآ أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍۢ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ**_  \n(Qur'an 4:79)\n\nThis verse clearly separates good (as grace from God) and harm (as a consequence of one’s own actions).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Surah Al-Anfal (8:51)**  \n> **\"This is for what your own hands have sent before, and indeed, Allah is not unjust to the servants.\"**  \n> _**ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلَّـٰمٍۢ لِّلْعَبِيدِ**_\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Surah Ash-Shura (42:30)**  \n> **\"Whatever affliction befalls you is because of what your own hands have earned, and He pardons much.\"**  \n> _**وَمَآ أَصَـٰبَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍۢ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُوا۟ عَن كَثِيرٍۢ**_\n\nThis emphasizes that even when we suffer, much has already been forgiven — again pointing to divine mercy.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Surah Aal-Imran (3:182)**  \n> **\"This is for what your own hands have sent before. And Allah is not unjust to [His] servants.\"**  \n> _**ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلَّـٰمٍۢ لِّلْعَبِيدِ**_\n\n---\n\nThese verses form part of the Qur'an’s moral framework: God is just, and people are accountable. No one is punished unfairly. There is also a profound balance: God forgives often, but He allows consequences to serve as reminders or tests.\n\nWould you like these quoted in a particular translation (e.g., Sahih International, Pickthall, etc.), or in Arabic calligraphy for presentation?",

      "content": "Yes, the Qur’an and Hadith are very clear that **intent (niyyah)** is central to the acceptance of deeds — and that actions must be done **sincerely (ikhlāṣ)** for the sake of Allah alone to be accepted.\n\nHere are the foundational sources that establish this principle:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Surah Al-Bayyina (98:5)**\n> **\"And they were not commanded except to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth...\"**  \n> _**وَمَآ أُمِرُوا۟ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ حُنَفَآءَ**_\n\nThis verse establishes that sincerity (ikhlāṣ) is the very core of religion.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Hadith: \"Actions are by intentions\" (niyyah)**  \nFrom **Sahih Bukhari & Sahih Muslim** — considered the **first hadith in many collections**:\n> **\"Actions are but by intentions, and every person will have only what they intended. So whoever emigrated for Allah and His Messenger, his emigration is for Allah and His Messenger. But whoever emigrated for some worldly gain or to marry a woman, his emigration is for what he emigrated for.\"**\n\nThis hadith is considered a foundation of Islamic ethics and jurisprudence. It emphasizes that **even identical outward actions** are judged differently depending on the **internal motive**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Surah Al-Kahf (18:110)**  \n> **\"So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord – let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone.\"**  \n> _**فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُوا۟ لِقَآءَ رَبِّهِۦ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًۭا صَـٰلِحًۭا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِۦ أَحَدًۭا**_\n\nThis verse implies that even **good deeds** must be **free of riyaa'** (showing off) or **shirk** (associating partners) — otherwise, they are **not accepted**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Statement:\n> ❝**No deed is accepted by Allah unless it is done sincerely for His sake and in accordance with His guidance.**❞  \nThis is a synthesis of the above verses and hadith and is widely taught in Islamic theology.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re looking for a short Arabic phrase that captures this, scholars often cite:\n\n> **لَا يُقْبَلُ الْعَمَلُ إِلَّا مَا أُرِيدَ بِهِ وَجْهُ اللَّهِ**  \n> _\"No deed is accepted except that which was intended for the Face (sake) of Allah.\"_\n\nWould you like help turning this into a teaching slide, a khutbah note, or a poster design with calligraphy?",
