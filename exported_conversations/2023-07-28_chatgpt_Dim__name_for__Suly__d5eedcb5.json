Over time, these types of surnames became fixed and were passed down from generation to generation.",

It is derived from the Arabic form of Solomon, who was a biblical figure and King of Israel known for his wisdom. The name Solomon itself comes from the Hebrew name Shelomoh, which is related to the word \"shalom\" meaning \"peace.\"\n\nIn Arabic, Sulaiman is used as a male given name and is very popular in Muslim communities due to its association with the Islamic Prophet Sulaiman, known as Solomon in the Judeo-Christian tradition. In the Quran, Sulaiman is a prophet and a king, known for his wisdom and his ability to speak with animals, particularly birds.",
