      "content": "So good morning everybody. Today I would like to speak with you at length in a rambling all sort of to-do list task idea kind of way and share a bunch of things. And then I'd like some help with prioritization of what I'm going to do today and to have a clear to-do list, idea list, to-don't list, and for-later list. Are you ready to help me with that? Take on the persona of a professional coach and go.",

      "content": "Okay, yeah, so I have a bunch of things to do today, I think, um, like usual, but one of the things I want to do is start prioritizing and getting better at organizing my mind. You see, it's been a bit crazy with moving, and there's just a bunch of stuff in the garage, and I don't even know where my clothes are, and I guess I can focus on that, or I can focus on finishing the UN stuff, which I think may be the most primary thing, because if I finish the UN stuff, then I can move on to potentially getting the contract and figuring out when I need to buy tickets. I need to buy tickets to Mexico, or get tickets for Mexico. I should, well, the people from the Mexico thing, I should finish the proposals and essays for that. I also should message Sherry, because Sherry wants to, I want to work with Sherry. Sherry, I need somebody to help me ship stuff, and maybe that's another thing we can do is talk to GPT or LLMs to identify different ways that I can take the business I have for the essential oils and find someone to help us do the shipping. I should call my family. I want to talk to my brothers and my sister. I should send the gifts over to my nieces and nephews, and I've paid off my credit cards, but I haven't done my taxes in a while. I'll probably figure out if there's an organization that will help me do some sort of",

Finishing the UN tasks to move forward with the contract.\n3. Buying tickets for Mexico and finishing proposals and essays for that trip.\n4. Messaging Sherry about working together and possibly helping with shipping for the essential oils business.\n5. Finding someone to help with shipping the essential oils.\n6. Calling your family, specifically your brothers and sister.\n7. Sending gifts to your nieces and nephews.\n8. Doing your taxes and finding an organization to help with that.\n\nNow, let's prioritize:\n\n1. **High Priority (must do today)**:\n   - Finish the UN tasks (to move forward with the contract).\n   - Buy tickets for Mexico.\n   - Message Sherry about working together.\n\n2. **Medium Priority (important but can wait a bit)**:\n   - Finish proposals and essays for Mexico.\n   - Call your family and send gifts to nieces and nephews.\n   - Organize the garage (finding clothes can be part of this).\n\n3. **Low Priority (for later)**:\n   - Find someone to help with shipping the essential oils (this might need more time and effort).\n   - Do your taxes (find an organization to help).\n\nDoes this look good to you? Feel free to add, remove, or adjust anything.",
