      "content": "As of my last update in April 2023, Frontier Airlines charged for carry-on baggage, and the fees varied depending on when and how you purchased the carry-on allowance. The fee for a carry-on bag at the gate was typically higher than if it was purchased in advance. As of that time, the gate fee for a carry-on bag was usually around $60, but this could vary.\n\nPlease note that airline fees can change, so I recommend checking Frontier Airlines' official website or contacting their customer service for the most current information.",
