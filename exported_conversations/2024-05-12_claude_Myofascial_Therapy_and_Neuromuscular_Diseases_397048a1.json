      "content": " Here is the information you requested, along with follow-up questions:\n\nThe 3 main names for this field of research are:\n1. Myofascial therapy \n2. Neuromuscular therapy\n3. Somatic bodywork\n\nSeven important keywords:\n1. Myofascial release\n2. Trigger point therapy \n3. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF)\n4. Neuromuscular diseases\n5. Fascia\n6. Massage therapy\n7. Manual therapy\n\nTop 5 foundational researchers and their most important papers:\n\n1. Robert Schleip \n- \"Fascia: The Tensional Network of the Human Body\" (2012) - comprehensive book on fascia research\n2. Leon Chaitow\n- \"Fascia: What it is and why it matters\" (2014) - overview of fascia's role in the body\n3. Thomas Findley\n- \"Fascia Research: What Do We Notice?\" (2007) - early paper highlighting importance of fascia research\n4. Siegfried Mense \n- \"Muscle Pain: Mechanisms and Clinical Significance\" (2008) - explores neurobiology of muscle pain\n5. Helene Langevin\n- \"Connective tissue: A body-wide signaling network?\" (2006) - proposes fascia as a body-wide communication network\n\nQuestions to clarify your goals:\n1. Are you focusing specifically on the efficacy of manual therapies for treating neuromuscular diseases? Or are you interested in the mechanisms by which these therapies may impact the nervous and muscular systems more broadly?\n2. What specific neuromuscular diseases are you most interested in (e.g. multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, ALS, etc.)?  \n3. Are you looking only at hands-on manual therapies or are you also interested in other bodywork modalities like movement therapies, mind-body techniques, etc.?\n\nQuestions I can answer based on the information provided:\n1. The three main umbrellas for this research are myofascial therapy, neuromuscular therapy, and somatic bodywork. Myofascial therapy focuses on the fascia, neuromuscular therapy targets the nervous system's influence on muscle function, and somatic bodywork is a broader term encompassing mind-body integration.\n\n2. Some of the most influential researchers who have helped establish the scientific foundation for this field include Robert Schleip, known for mapping the body's fascial network; Leon Chaitow, who connected fascia research to clinical practice; and Helene Langevin, who proposed fascia as a body-wide communication system. Thomas Findley and Siegfried Mense have also made important contributions to our understanding of fascia and muscle pain.\n\n3. Key treatment techniques that fall under these umbrellas include myofascial release, trigger point therapy, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), and various forms of massage therapy and manual therapy. The mechanisms and efficacy of these treatments, especially as they relate to neuromuscular diseases, are active areas of research.\n\nQuestions only you can answer given your background:\n1. What motivated you to choose this topic for your graduation thesis? Is it based on personal interests, clinical experiences, coursework, or something else?\n\n2. How much exposure have you had so far to fascia research and manual therapies, either through your studies or any hands-on training? \n\n3. Are there any researchers or practitioners in France that you are hoping to connect with for mentorship or guidance as you develop your thesis? Or any leading institutions in France doing important work in this area?\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to provide before I suggest next steps for your literature review. I'm happy to brainstorm further once I have a clearer sense of your background and specific interests within this broad field.",

Given your personal connection to the topic through your father's experience with MS, your interest in sports medicine, and your preliminary exposure to manual therapies, it sounds like you have a strong foundation to build upon.\n\nHere are some suggestions for researchers and institutions to consider reaching out to, both in France and internationally:\n\nIn France:\n1. Isabelle Quere, Professor of Vascular Medicine at the University of Montpellier, has published on the role of fascia in lymphatic functioning and manual lymphatic drainage techniques.\n\n2. Pascal Pommerol, President of the French Society of Myofascial Chains, teaches myofascial techniques and has written on the fascial network.\n\n3. The Centre de Formation Universitaire en Thérapie Manuelle (CFUTM) at the Université Paris-Saclay offers training in manual therapies and conducts research in this area.\n\nInternationally:\n1. The Fascia Research Society, based in the US, hosts international research conferences and maintains a directory of fascia researchers worldwide.\n\n2. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), part of the US National Institutes of Health, funds research on complementary therapies including massage and bodywork for various conditions.\n\n3. The Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health, a US-based international organization, promotes research and education on integrative therapies at academic medical centers.\n\n4. Researchers at A.T. Still University in the US, including Michael Hamm and Jerry Draper-Rodi, have published on osteopathic manual techniques for neurological conditions.\n\n5. The Sutherland Cranial Teaching Foundation in the UK offers courses on craniosacral therapy, which involves gentle manipulations of the fascia and cranial bones and has been studied for neurological conditions.\n\nI would recommend starting by reaching out to Prof. Thevenon and any other local experts he might recommend. You could also consider contacting some of the researchers mentioned above, especially those with experience in manual therapies for neurological conditions like MS. The organizations may also be helpful for identifying additional researchers or learning about relevant conferences and training opportunities.\n\nAs next steps, I would suggest:\n\n1. Clarify the specific scope of your review, i.e. which manual therapies and which neuromuscular diseases you plan to focus on. This will help guide your literature searches.\n\n2. Conduct preliminary searches on PubMed, Google Scholar, and other databases using combinations of your keywords to get a sense of the existing literature. \n\n3. Begin organizing the papers you find into categories based on the specific therapy, disease, and/or mechanism of action being studied.\n\n4. Identify gaps in the literature or areas of controversy that warrant further exploration in your review.\n\n5. Consider any clinical applications or research directions you might want to propose based on your findings.\n\n6. Develop an outline for your review that will allow you to synthesize the current state of the field and highlight your original insights.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions!
