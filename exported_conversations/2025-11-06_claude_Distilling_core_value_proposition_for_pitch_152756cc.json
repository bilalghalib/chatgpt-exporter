  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is working on Cursive, a digital platform they're developing, and sought help refining their pitch strategy. They were struggling to distill their complex product vision into clear, compelling messaging for different audiences. The user described Cursive as having several key features: auto-navigation where pages \"know themselves and you,\" handwriting embodiment, absence of images as proof of human creation, emphasis on craft, and innovative \"page objects\" with dynamic properties like pinball balls that can be magnetized and bounce.\n\nClaude helped the user identify their core insight: \"In an age of AI that can fake any output, the only proof of humanity is process.\" This framing positioned Cursive as capturing and verifying the human creation process rather than just final outputs. The conversation developed tailored pitches for three target audiences: schools (focusing on seeing student thinking processes rather than just final answers), people dissatisfied with social media (emphasizing authentic, provably human content in a calm environment), and facilitators using platforms like Circle (offering human-rhythm-respecting tools that support rather than replace facilitation).\n\nThe user also inquired whether Cursive would become an internet protocol or remain an application. Claude outlined a three-phase evolution path: starting as a functional app, then enabling exports to open formats, and eventually becoming a protocol standard while making the original platform optional. The conversation established \"Cursive proves you made it\" as a potential one-liner and positioned the platform as \"handmade certification for digital content\" in an AI-saturated world. The user demonstrated deep technical thinking about their product's unique properties and showed particular interest in the metaphor of pages as objects with physical properties and mass.",

            "extracted_content": "# The Cursive Protocol\n\n**Software for hospitality, reflection, and human craft.**\n\nCursive is a quiet stand for humanity on the internet. The protocol encodes a way of working where hosts extend invitations, people respond with their own hands, and intelligence appears as a whispering companionâ€”not an author. Everything in this repository is the constitution that keeps the software, database, and vocabulary aligned with that promise.\n\n**New here?** Read [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) for the public-facing vision, or [VALUES.md](VALUES.md) for the philosophical foundation.\n\n---\n\n## Preamble Â· Software for Human Connection\n\nWe build tools that deepen connection to:\n\n- **Self** â€“ Journaling, reflection, embodied handwriting.\n- **Others** â€“ Shared prompts, cohorts, quorum-gated gatherings.\n- **World** â€“ Situated practice: â€œlook up,â€ capture a leaf, walk outside.\n- **Truth** â€“ Doubt, exploration, provenance, open-mindedness.\n\nThe protocol exists so that any implementation of Cursiveâ€”our reference app or yoursâ€”remains faithful to these values. Pages stay human-authored. Suggestions arrive as whispers. Facilitators are hosts, not automation. Every artifact can travel to another system that speaks the protocol.\n\n---\n\n## Core Values (Operationalized Principles)\n\n1. **Human Agency Is Sacred**  \n   The user is the craftsperson. Tools assist; they never take the final action. Structured outputs must be ratified by the human who created them.\n\n2. **Embodied Cognition & Situated Practice**  \n   Thinking happens with bodies, tools, and places. The protocol treats handwriting, drawn ink, GPS context, and physically present collaborators as first-class signals.\n\n3. **Transparency & Provenance**  \n   Every action records who initiated it (human vs. suggested), what context was present, and how confident the interpretation was. Provenance travels with exports.\n\n4. **Hospitality Over Automation**  \n   Hosts guide the rhythm. Software nudges, summarizes, and prepares, but never usurps the social contract of facilitation.\n\n5. **Verifiable Craft & Process (Competence Over Automation)**  \n   The system records the process of makingâ€”stroke counts, drafts, and timingsâ€”while letting humans decide what to reveal. AI scaffolds competence rather than replacing skill.\n\n6. **Durable Sovereignty & Portability**  \n   Content, badges, and interaction receipts belong to their authors. Everything can be exported, verified, and re-imported into another Cursive-compatible tool.\n\n---\n\n## Domain Primitives (Vocabulary + Value Alignment)\n\nEach primitive is defined once, here. Implementations **must** keep terminology, schema, and behavior consistent with these definitions. For detailed field-level mappings see `docs/CORE_PRIMITIVES.md`.\n\n### Page\n- **Definition:** The sacred artifact. A TipTap-compatible document containing only human-entered content (text, handwriting, drawings).  \n- **Schema:** `public.pages` (content JSONB, metadata JSONB, provenance flags).  \n- **Values:** Human Agency, Verifiable Craft, Transparency.  \n- **Affordances:** Multiple sheets, process fingerprint, export receipts.\n\n### Collection\n- **Definition:** A top-level container (journal, guide, cohort archive).  \n- **Schema:** `public.collections` with `kind` (`workspace`, `template`, `shared`).  \n- **Values:** Hospitality, Durable Sovereignty.  \n- **Notes:** Replaces legacy term â€œnotebook.â€ Terminology audit enforces this.\n\n### Folder\n- **Definition:** Optional organizational layer within a collection.  \n- **Schema:** `public.folders` (supports nesting, visibility).  \n- **Values:** Agency (self-organization), Hospitality (curated experiences).\n\n### Page Break\n- **Definition:** Visual marker in a Page indicating A4-sized boundaries (297mm intervals).\n- **Schema:** Stored in `pages.metadata.page_breaks[]` with offset and ID.\n- **Values:** Embodied Cognition (A4 metaphor), Slowness, Craft.\n- **Note:** Pages are paginated for performance; breaks are logical markers. See [ADR-003](adrs/003-paginated-documents-with-session-recording.md).\n\n### Invitation\n- **Definition:** A scheduled prompt authored by a host for a cohort.\n- **Schema:** `invitations` (renamed from `released_prompts`), `mail_items` (delivery), `pages` with `page_type='template'` (source material).\n- **Values:** Hospitality, Connection to Others.\n- **Note:** See schema migration `20251106000000_surgical_schema_cleanup.sql` for table renames.\n\n### Tool Plugin\n- **Definition:** A consciously invoked aid (e.g., Leaf Identifier, Mood Tracker). Presents its own UI (modal/sidebar), records outputs with provenance, and never writes directly to the page.  \n- **Schema:** `tool_plugins`, `tool_runs`, `tool_cards`.  \n- **Values:** Embodied Cognition, Competence over Automation, Transparency.\n\n### Quorum\n- **Definition:** A proof that *N* authenticated humans were present/engaged, unlocking content or actions.  \n- **Schema:** `quorum_events`, `page_events`, future on-chain receipt.  \n- **Values:** Connection to Others, Verifiable Craft, Durable Sovereignty.  \n- **Export:** Includes receipt (timestamp, participants, validation contract).\n\n### Transclusion\n- **Definition:** Reference to external page/block rendered in situ while preserving ownership.  \n- **Schema:** `transclusions` table + backlinks.  \n- **Values:** Connection to Self/Others, Provenance, Portability.\n\n### Insight Lens\n- **Definition:** Creator-defined analysis or scaffolding (LLM-assisted or deterministic). Produces suggestions (whispers) with confidence & reasoning.  \n- **Schema:** `insight_lenses`, `insights`, `insight_evidence_links`.  \n- **Values:** Connection to Truth, Competence over Automation, Transparency.\n\n### Host Prompt Cycle\n- **Definition:** The rhythm of a facilitated experience (schedule, releases, pauses, digests).  \n- **Schema:** `mail_items`, `host_tasks`, `compilations`.  \n- **Values:** Hospitality, Slow Correspondence.\n\n### Session Recording\n- **Definition:** Time-series log of user actions (scroll, typing, drawing) for playback and reflection.\n- **Schema:** `pages.metadata.session_recordings[]` with timestamps and event data.\n- **Values:** Verifiable Craft (process visibility), Reflection, Teaching.\n- **Affordances:** Replay creation process, share workflow, teaching demonstrations.\n\n### Export Receipt\n- **Definition:** Bundle describing exported content, provenance, quorum proofs, badges, and encryption metadata.\n- **Schema:** `.cursive` archive manifest + optional smart-contract reference.\n- **Values:** Durable Sovereignty, Transparency.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nThe reference application is designed around practical layers:\n\n1. **Page (Human craft)** â€“ Sacred, printable, accessible.\n2. **Whisper layer** â€“ Suggests relationships, never writes; records `origin = suggested`.\n3. **Hospitality Layer (Host rhythm)** â€“ Guides invitations, pauses, compilations.\n4. **Presence & Quorum** â€“ Verifies embodied participation.\n5. **Portability** â€“ Everything is exportable, with receipts and citations.\n\nSee `docs/CORE_PRIMITIVES.md` for current implementation details and `docs/SHARE_AND_VERIFY.md` for the active development roadmap.\n\n---\n\n## Guarantees of the Protocol\n\n1. **Human-only Page Content** â€“ No automated writes. Provenance flag required for all modifications.\n2. **Whispers, Not Commands** â€“ Suggestions appear in chrome, are dismissible, and require explicit insertion.\n3. **Ratified Structured Data** â€“ Structured answers include raw input, confidence, and human confirmation state.\n4. **Process Preservation** â€“ Stroke counts, edit timelines, and quorum events are recorded for verification but shared only with user consent.\n5. **Portability & Export** â€“ `.cursive` export includes pages, metadata, receipts, and optional encrypted badges. Receiving systems can verify provenance.\n6. **Schema Alignment** â€“ Generated TypeScript types from the schema are authoritative. Terminology audits ensure vocabulary alignment.\n\n---\n\n## Working with the Protocol (Contributor Workflow)\n\n1. **Start with Vocabulary (Docs â†’ DB â†’ Frontend begins here)**\n   Propose new concepts or field changes in `docs/CORE_PRIMITIVES.md`. Call out the value alignment and reference links you will cite in code reviews.\n\n2. **Document Architectural Decisions**\n   For significant changes, create an ADR in `adrs/` capturing the context, decision, and consequences.\n\n3. **Evolve the Schema from the Spec**\n   Write migrations (with backfill scripts) that align with the primitives. Regenerate Supabase types (`npx supabase gen types ...`) immediately after landing the migration so TypeScript stays authoritative.\n\n4. **Practice Test-Driven Implementation**\n   Before wiring UI or services, add or update failing tests (Vitest for pure logic, Playwright/manual checklists for flows). The RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR loop should cite the related primitive definitions to keep intent visible.\n\n5. **Run Terminology & Schema Checks**\n   `npm run terminology-audit` and schema diff jobs must pass before merging; they confirm the docs â†’ schema contract has stayed intact.\n\n6. **Implementations Follow the Typed Contract**\n   Reference applications (e.g., `reference-app/`) import the regenerated types, avoid `any`, and cite primitive definitions in PR descriptions. Each feature branch should document the doc â†’ schema â†’ code handshake in its QA notes.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Map\n\n```\nprotocol/\nâ”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # You are here â€“ constitution + values + primitives\nâ”œâ”€â”€ MANIFESTO.md                 # Public-facing vision (start here if new)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ VALUES.md                    # Core values and philosophical foundation (for implementers)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ FINAL_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md     # Documentation reorganization summary\nâ”‚\nâ”œâ”€â”€ docs/\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ START_HERE.md            # New developer onboarding (90 min)\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CORE_PRIMITIVES.md       # Data model and current reality\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SHARE_AND_VERIFY.md      # Active development roadmap (4 weeks)\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md     # Schema cleanup procedures\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md     # UI/UX implications of values\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sarec-integration-guide.md # Assessment authoring guide\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ QUICK_REFERENCE.md       # Cheat sheet\nâ”‚   â”‚\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ archived/                # Replaced docs and premature specs\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ replaced/            # Superseded by better versions\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ protocol-exploration/ # Premature protocol abstractions\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ architectural-decisions/ # Exploratory ADRs\nâ”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ feature-specs/       # Future feature specs\nâ”‚       â””â”€â”€ meta-docs/           # Cleanup documentation\nâ”‚\nâ””â”€â”€ adrs/                        # Architecture decision records\n    â””â”€â”€ 003-paginated-documents-with-session-recording.md # Implemented\n```\n\nRelated repository: `reference-app/` (closed-source implementation following this protocol).\n\n---\n\n## Current Status (November 2025)\n\n- **Active Development:** Share + Verify MVP (4-week sprint) - See `docs/SHARE_AND_VERIFY.md`\n- **Schema Cleanup:** Ready to run surgical migration - See `docs/MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md`\n- **Documentation:** Reorganized for practical implementation focus\n- **Next:** Confidence tracking for SAREC assessments, proof-of-human fingerprints\n\nFor questions, open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.

            "extracted_content": "# The Cursive Manifesto\n\n**Software for human hands and hearts.**\n\n---\n\n## What Cursive Is\n\nYou write with ink on digital paper. Your processâ€”the pauses, corrections, and deliberate strokesâ€”creates an unfakeable fingerprint proving you made this.\n\nTeachers assign work with embedded assessments. Students see exactly what's measured and why. Routes adapt to understanding, not just scores.\n\nHosts facilitate groups on human rhythms. Software reminds when to release prompts but never replaces the facilitator.\n\nEverything exports. Your pages, your data, your badgesâ€”truly owned, cryptographically yours.\n\nThis is the alternative to the hostile web.\n\n---\n\n## The Problem We're Solving\n\nThe modern internet optimizes for engagement, not depth. It treats your attention as inventory to be captured and monetized. It automates away the friction that creates meaning.\n\nWe choose differently.\n\nWe believe that:\n- **Depth beats velocity** - Some things deserve sustained attention\n- **Process matters as much as output** - How you made it is part of what it means\n- **Humans should guide, AI should assist** - The craftsperson holds the tool\n- **Beauty should be calm, not stimulating** - Aesthetics can create space for thought\n- **Your work should be yours** - Truly owned, fully exportable, cryptographically verifiable\n\n---\n\n## Our Core Commitments\n\n### 1. Pages Are Sacred\n\nYour journal is yours aloneâ€”no AI ever writes in it.\n\n**What this means:**\n- Content comes from human hands: typing, handwriting, drawing\n- AI suggestions appear as whispers in margins, never auto-applied\n- Every change requires human intention and action\n- \"Origin flags\" track what's human-authored vs. suggested\n- Automated writes are prohibited by design\n\n**Why it matters:**\nYour page is proof of your thinking. When you share work, others know it's authentically yours.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Process Is the Proof\n\nStroke timing, idle pauses, and error patterns create unfakeable fingerprints of human work.\n\n**What this means:**\n- Background recording captures how you create (not just what)\n- Fingerprint algorithm detects human patterns AI can't fake\n- Session playback shows your creation process\n- Verification badges certify craft, not just outcomes\n- Teachers/reviewers see both product and process\n\n**Why it matters:**\nIn an age of AI-generated everything, process is the new authenticity. Your work carries proof it's yours.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Assessment Serves Learning, Not Sorting\n\nRubrics are authored alongside content, not bolted on later. Students see the logic, understand the measures, and can contest with reasoning.\n\n**What this means (SAREC framework):**\n- Rubrics created during content authoring (not after)\n- Evidence is transparent: you see what's measured and why\n- Routes adapt to understanding, not just scores\n- Confidence scores show uncertainty, not false precision\n- Students can challenge assessments with their reasoning\n- Teachers calibrate rubrics against sample work before deploying\n\n**Why it matters:**\nAssessment should scaffold learning, not gatekeep it. When you understand what's measured and why, evaluation becomes a learning conversation.\n\n---\n\n### 4. AI as Apprentice, Never Author\n\nTools appear as whispers in margins, never in the page. Every suggestion shows reasoning and confidence. Humans ratify; AI never auto-applies.\n\n**What this means:**\n- LLMs scaffold understanding, don't replace thinking\n- Suggestion + ratification pattern (never auto-accept)\n- All AI output includes confidence scores and reasoning\n- Tools help structure freeform input (multi-select from essay)\n- Process beats output: learning matters more than answers\n\n**Why it matters:**\nAI should make you more competent, not more dependent. Competence requires doing the work yourself, with scaffolding that fades.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Hosts Guide on Human Rhythms\n\nSoftware reminds and prepares; humans release. Hosts can pause, skip weeks, or go off-script. The software never sends on your behalf.\n\n**What this means:**\n- Human hosts required for group experiences\n- Software prepares releases, humans approve sending\n- Email/SMS responders extend host capacity (but don't replace)\n- Hosts can pause cohorts (vacations, illness)\n- Facilitation is a human relationship, not automation\n\n**Why it matters:**\nHospitality requires presence. When you receive an invitation, a real person sent it at a deliberate moment.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Beauty Is Not Decoration\n\nJapanese woodworking aesthetic: minimal, precise, functional. Stone colors, not attention-grabbing primaries. Calm is designed, not accidental.\n\n**What this means:**\n- 2px corners, not rounded everything\n- No animations, transitions, or \"delight\" micro-interactions\n- Typography and white space create hierarchy\n- Stone colors (warm grays, soft earth tones)\n- Deliberate friction: page edges, finite sheets, visible boundaries\n\n**Why it matters:**\nBeauty creates space for thought. When interfaces are calm, your attention stays on your work, not the tool.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Pages Have Edges\n\nDocuments end at 297mm, like real paper. Overflow creates new sheets, not infinite scroll. Digital can learn from physical constraints.\n\n**What this means:**\n- A4 page size (210mm Ã— 297mm) as default canvas\n- Page breaks create rhythm and decision points\n- Adding sheets requires intention (anti-infinite-scroll)\n- Pagination helps you gauge scope and plan work\n- Fixed-size surfaces encourage deliberate expansion\n\n**Why it matters:**\nConstraints create craft. When you know the page ends, you compose differently. Boundaries are features, not limitations.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Everything You Make Is Yours\n\nExport to `.cursive` archives with full provenance. Verification badges you truly own (cryptographically, not just \"displayed on profile\").\n\n**What this means:**\n- Complete export: pages, metadata, fingerprints, badges\n- Provenance receipts travel with your work\n- Quorum proofs (group achievements) cryptographically signed\n- Import into any Cursive-compatible tool\n- No lock-in, ever\n\n**Why it matters:**\nTrue ownership means leaving is always possible. If you don't like our choices, take your work elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n## From Values to Design\n\n**How philosophy becomes features:**\n\n### Value: Qualitative Perception\nâ†’ **Design:** Process visibility, stroke-level recording, time-on-task tracking\nâ†’ **Feature:** Verification badges celebrate craft and sustained effort, not just correct answers\n\n### Value: Embodied Cognition\nâ†’ **Design:** Pen-first interface, GPS context, photo prompts\nâ†’ **Feature:** \"Look Up\" tool identifies trees around you; drawing is a first-class citizen\n\n### Value: Competence over Automation\nâ†’ **Design:** Suggestion + ratification pattern, confidence scores, contestable assessments\nâ†’ **Feature:** SAREC shows rubric logic transparently; students can say \"I actually did understand this\"\n\n### Value: Hospitality over Hostility\nâ†’ **Design:** Human hosts required, software reminds only, email-based releases\nâ†’ **Feature:** Hosts can pause/resume cycles for vacations; no auto-sending without approval\n\n### Value: Verifiable Craft\nâ†’ **Design:** Background session recording, fingerprint algorithm\nâ†’ **Feature:** Unfakeable proof-of-human via stroke variance, idle patterns, revision sequences\n\n### Value: Sovereignty\nâ†’ **Design:** `.cursive` export format, cryptographic signatures\nâ†’ **Feature:** Take your work, badges, and provenance anywhere; import into compatible tools\n\n---\n\n## What We Refuse to Build\n\nSome features are popular but antithetical to our values. We will not build:\n\n- âŒ **Algorithmic feeds** that optimize for time-on-site\n- âŒ **Notification badges** fighting for attention\n- âŒ **Infinite scroll** removing natural stopping points\n- âŒ **Gamification** creating false urgency (streaks, leaderboards)\n- âŒ **Auto-posting** or scheduled AI responses\n- âŒ **Engagement analytics** visible to users\n- âŒ **Growth hacking** features of any kind\n- âŒ **Dark patterns** of any form\n- âŒ **Attention capture** mechanisms\n- âŒ **AI auto-apply** (ever)\n\nIf something makes the tool more \"sticky\" at the cost of user agency, we don't build it.\n\n---\n\n## Who This Is For\n\n### Students & Learners\nYou deserve tools that make you more capable, not more dependent. Cursive scaffolds understanding without doing the work for you. Your process is visible proof of your learning.\n\n### Teachers & Facilitators\nYou need assessment tools that don't require becoming data scientists. SAREC lets you author rubrics alongside content, see process alongside product, and maintain human-centered facilitation at scale.\n\n### Writers & Creators\nYou want a journal that's truly yoursâ€”no AI polluting your thinking space. Export everything, own your process, share your craft with proof it's authentically yours.\n\n### Groups & Cohorts\nYou need rhythms that respect human presence. Hosts guide, software supports, and nobody gets automated communications pretending to be personal.\n\n---\n\n## What Success Looks Like\n\nWe'll know Cursive works when:\n\n1. **Students contest assessments with reasoning** - Not just \"I think this is wrong,\" but \"Here's why my approach demonstrates understanding.\"\n\n2. **Teachers author rubrics during content creation** - Assessment feels native, not bolted-on.\n\n3. **Process fingerprints become standard proof** - Sharing work includes sharing how you made it.\n\n4. **Hosts facilitate without burnout** - Software reminds and prepares; hosts remain present.\n\n5. **Exports are common** - People take their work elsewhere, and that's celebrated.\n\n6. **Calm is the default experience** - No one describes Cursive as \"engaging\" or \"addictive.\"\n\n---\n\n## Technical Philosophy\n\n### Protocol vs. Implementation\n\n**Protocol** = Export format (how work travels between tools)\n**Implementation** = Our reference app (one way to honor these values)\n\nThe protocol ensures your work is portable. Our implementation shows one way to build for these values. Others can build different implementations that respect the same commitments.\n\n### Open Core, Open Values\n\n- The protocol spec is open (MIT license)\n- The reference implementation may stay closed\n- The values are universal: any tool can adopt them\n- `.cursive` archives let you leave anytime\n\n---\n\n## The Alternative Web\n\nThe hostile web:\n- Optimizes for engagement over depth\n- Treats humans as inventory (attention to monetize)\n- Uses dark patterns to capture time\n- Makes AI replace rather than scaffold\n- Locks you in with proprietary formats\n\nThe alternative (Cursive):\n- Optimizes for depth over velocity\n- Treats humans as craftspeople\n- Uses deliberate friction to create meaning\n- Makes AI assist rather than replace\n- Gives you full ownership and portability\n\n---\n\n## A Manifesto, Not a Business Plan\n\nThis document describes what we believe, not what's profitable. Some of these choices limit growth. That's intentional.\n\nWe'd rather build for depth than scale, for craft than convenience, for sovereignty than stickiness.\n\nIf you want another engagement-optimized platform, dozens exist. If you want software that treats you as a craftsperson with agency, we're building it.\n\n---\n\n## Join Us\n\n### As a User\nTry Cursive when it's ready. Export often. Contest assessments. Share your process. Own your work.\n\n### As a Developer\nRead `docs/START_HERE.md`. Build implementations that honor these values. Propose improvements to the protocol.\n\n### As an Educator\nHelp us understand how assessment authoring really works. Calibrate rubrics. Give feedback on SAREC.\n\n### As a Fellow Traveler\nIf you're building tools that resist the hostile web, talk to us.

            "extracted_content": "# The Cursive Values\n\n**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025\n**Purpose:** To define the philosophical foundation of the Cursive Protocol\n\n---\n\n## Preamble: Reintegrating the Human Heart\n\nCursive is a quiet stand for humanity on the internet. It rejects the post-Cartesian split that severed mind from body, reason from feeling, objective from subjective. We believe that true knowing is qualitative, embodied, and feltâ€”not just measured and analyzed.\n\nThis is software for the human heart. It creates space for:\n- **Awe** - The feeling when we witness someone's genuine craft\n- **Pride** - The satisfaction of working hard on something beautiful\n- **Depth** - The productive friction that comes from sitting with difficulty\n- **Connection** - The recognition that comes from truly seeing another's work\n\nWe use modern technology not to optimize away the human experience, but to amplify and celebrate it.\n\n---\n\n## The Six Core Values\n\n### 1. Qualitative Perception & The Human Heart\n\n**Core Idea:** There are ways of knowing that cannot be reduced to data. Beauty, meaning, connection, and understanding are felt realities that precede and transcend measurement. The system must honor qualitative experience as a legitimate form of knowledge.\n\n**How This Value Speaks:**\n> \"...productive friction, helping people make time/space to really enjoy the beauty of human connection and depth and working hard on something and being proud of the work and craft and seeing other people's work/effort and being in awe...\"\n\n**Implications for the Protocol:**\n- The protocol must have primitives for expressing and preserving qualitative dimensions: beauty, effort, meaning, connection\n- Metrics exist to serve understanding, never to replace felt experience\n- The system deliberately creates \"productive friction\" - moments that require patience, care, and sustained attention\n- Features are designed to help people notice and appreciate the texture of human work: the hesitation in a drawing, the revision history of a thought, the care in a response\n- Success is measured not in engagement metrics but in reported depth of experience and quality of connection\n\n**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\n- Reducing human experience to quantifiable metrics (likes, followers, engagement scores)\n- Optimizing for speed and efficiency over depth and meaning\n- Treating all content as equivalent \"data\" regardless of its human context\n- Gamification that manipulates behavior rather than supporting intrinsic motivation\n\n---\n\n### 2. Embodied & Situated Knowing\n\n**Core Idea:** True understanding is not abstract or disembodied. It is rooted in our physical bodies, our senses, and the specific places we inhabit. The digital tool must honor and connect with the physical world, not replace it.\n\n**How This Value Speaks:**\n> \"...connecting people to their qualitative perspectives, connecting to place (GPS, looking around you, a tool that allows you to upload a photo of a leaf to know what kind of trees are growing nearby, etc) and to the body, using a pen, drawing...\"\n\n**Implications for the Protocol:**\n- The protocol must support sensory input: location, images, audio, physical gestures\n- The page metaphor respects the haptic reality of paper - it has size, texture, resistance\n- Drawing with a pen is a first-class citizen, not a secondary feature\n- Tools can connect writing to place: what trees surround you, what season is it, where are you sitting\n- The system assumes users are whole people in real places, not disembodied \"users\"\n\n**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\n- Assuming all interaction happens at a desk on a large screen\n- Treating physical context as \"metadata\" rather than essential information\n- Making handwriting/drawing second-class to typing\n- Creating experiences that require sustained screen attention at the expense of being present in place\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apprenticeship & Mastery (Competence over Automation)\n\n**Core Idea:** Technology should function as a master craftsperson's tool, designed to help an apprentice gain competence. It scaffolds skill, it doesn't automate it away. Its purpose is to make the user better, not to make itself indispensable.\n\n**How This Value Speaks:**\n> \"...the idea that the LLM doesn't DO anything for you, it helps you gain competence not decays it... people can talk freeform and the LLMs can help provide a structured answer (multi/single select, number, etc) without making the person a button presser, they can share freely...\"\n\n**Implications for the Protocol:**\n- AI interactions must be designed as learning opportunities, not shortcuts\n- The protocol favors \"suggestion and ratification\" over \"generation and acceptance\"\n- The system tracks the user's engagement with the process as a measure of growing skill\n- Complexity is revealed progressively - beginners get scaffolding, masters get full control\n- Every automated assistance must have a manual override that teaches the underlying skill\n\n**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\n- AI that completes tasks without user involvement (e.g., \"write this essay for me\")\n- Hiding complexity in ways that prevent understanding\n- Creating dependency on the tool rather than building user capability\n- Optimizing for quick results over deep learning\n\n---\n\n### 4. Gardens, Not Battlefields (Hospitality over Hostility)\n\n**Core Idea:** The digital world should be a cultivated space for growth, reflection, and connectionâ€”a gardenâ€”not a battlefield for attention. This requires human tending, deliberate paths, and a rejection of algorithmic manipulation.\n\n**How This Value Speaks:**\n> \"...hospitality (courses are together, hosts //must// send you the prompts on schedule, the tool just reminds them when to send it)... we want to create a calm, connecting publishing platform where we can show ourselves as one of the last stands for humanity on the internet, webrings not algorithmic... we recognize in the background - not as a way to manipulate people into behaviors (badges)...\"\n\n**Implications for the Protocol:**\n- The protocol must prioritize human-curated connections over machine-generated feeds\n- It must have primitives for \"hosting\" and \"guiding\" that empower human facilitators\n- The system operates on human rhythms, not algorithmic optimization for engagement\n- Recognition exists to honor genuine accomplishment, never to manipulate behavior\n- Connections happen through deliberate invitation (webrings), not opaque algorithms\n\n**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\n- Infinite scroll, autoplay, or other engagement-maximizing dark patterns\n- Algorithmic feeds that optimize for attention capture\n- Gamification designed to create addiction (streaks, points, leaderboards)\n- Automated notifications that interrupt flow\n- Making human facilitators optional or replaceable by automation\n\n---\n\n### 5. Authenticity & Verifiable Craft (Process as Proof)\n\n**Core Idea:** In an age of effortless digital reproduction, the process of human creationâ€”with all its effort, messiness, and intentionâ€”is a precious and verifiable act. The system must be able to distinguish and celebrate authentic human work.\n\n**How This Value Speaks:**\n> \"...we don't allow pasting without provenance/citation and maybe no images unless you drew them yourself... making it so you do your work out loud, in public, sharing your page/process... proof-ish of human (save stroke count/monitor for human patterns and personal fingerprints)...\"\n\n**Implications for the Protocol:**\n- The protocol must be a high-fidelity recorder of the creative act\n- It needs primitives for provenance, citation, and process_metadata (stroke data, edit history, time spent)\n- The system defines what constitutes a \"proof-of-human\" signature\n- Content created by AI must be clearly marked and cited\n- The process of creation is as valuable as the final artifact\n- Users can choose to share their \"making-of\" as evidence of authentic work\n\n**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\n- Allowing uncited copying or pasting from external sources\n- Treating AI-generated and human-generated content as equivalent\n- Hiding the process and only showing polished final products\n- Making it easy to falsely claim work as one's own\n- Optimizing for productivity at the expense of genuine craft\n\n---\n\n### 6. Sovereignty & Durability (True Ownership)\n\n**Core Idea:** A person's thoughts, identity, and reputation are their own. They must be cryptographically owned, truly portable, and durable enough to outlive any single platform. The protocol, not the platform, is the guarantee.\n\n**How This Value Speaks:**\n> \"...encrypted profiles where badges are truly owned by people and exportable off the system... all this must be exportable and transposable to other systems operating by the same protocol, the protocol must encode the values...\"\n\n**Implications for the Protocol:**\n- The protocol is the ultimate guarantor of user sovereignty\n- It must define data structures not just for content, but for verifiable credentials, reputation, and identity\n- All user data must be exportable in a clean, documented format\n- The protocol must be built on open, durable standards (not proprietary formats)\n- A user must be able to pack up their entire digital self and move elsewhere\n- The protocol itself must encode these values so that any compliant implementation respects them\n\n**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\n- Proprietary data formats that lock users in\n- Making export difficult, incomplete, or lossy\n- Claiming ownership over user-generated content\n- Building features that only work within the platform ecosystem\n- Using network effects to trap users rather than serve them\n\n---\n\n## Living These Values: Design Principles\n\nEvery feature, every decision, every line of code must be judged against these values. When in doubt, ask:\n\n1. **Does this honor the qualitative, felt experience?** Or does it reduce humanity to metrics?\n2. **Does this connect people to their bodies and places?** Or does it further disembodiment?\n3. **Does this help users gain competence?** Or does it create dependency?\n4. **Does this create a cultivated garden?** Or does it exploit attention?\n5. **Does this honor authentic craft?** Or does it enable easy forgery?\n6. **Does this ensure sovereignty?** Or does it trap users?\n\nIf a feature violates any of these values, we either redesign it or we don't build it.\n\n---\n\n## The Promise\n\nWe promise to build technology that:\n- Respects the human heart and qualitative knowing\n- Honors the body and the physical world\n- Helps people grow in skill and understanding\n- Creates calm, hospitable spaces for connection\n- Celebrates authentic human effort\n- Ensures lasting ownership and portability\n\nThis is the Cursive Protocol. This is our stand for humanity on the internet.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- See [DATA_DICTIONARY.md](./docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md) for how values translate into primitives\n- See [DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md](./docs/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md) for UI/UX design principles\n"

Proof of Human (No Platform Needed)\nOld way:\nUpload to Cursive platform → platform verifies → trapped in platform\nNew way:\nhtml<article id=\"my-essay\" data-crs=\"context.crs\">\n  <p>My essay...</p>\n</article>\ncss/* context.crs */\n#my-essay {\n  provenance: human;\n  provenance-fingerprint: \"sha256:abc...\";\n  provenance-data: url(\"strokes.json\");\n}\nAny browser can verify it. Any platform can read it. Any employer can check it.\n2. Curation Without Likes\nOld way:\nPlatform shows \"347 likes\" → engagement trap\nNew way:\ncss#my-essay {\n  curation-featured: true;\n  curation-reason: \"Demonstrates clear thinking about complex topic\";\n  curation-curator: \"prof-smith@university.edu\";\n}\nReasoning is built into the file. Travels with the content. Inspectable.\n3. Semantic Navigation\nOld way:\nAlgorithmic recommendation engine → black box → engagement optimization\nNew way:\ncss#my-essay {\n  semantic-embedding: url(\"embedding.bin\");\n  routing-suggests: \"#essay-2\" 87%, \"#stoicism-intro\" 76%;\n  routing-reasoning: \"Similar themes about meaning and practice\";\n}\nRelationships are declared. Confidence is explicit. Reasoning is visible.\n4. Cross-Site Cohorts\nOld way:\nCohort trapped in one platform\nNew way:\nStudent A's site:\ncss#my-response {\n  context-cohort: \"philosophy-101-fall-2025\";\n  context-response-to: url(\"https://prof.com/prompt-1.html\");\n}\nStudent B's site:\ncss#my-response {\n  context-cohort: \"philosophy-101-fall-2025\";\n  context-response-to: url(\"https://prof.com/prompt-1.html\");\n}\nProfessor's aggregator:\njavascript// Fetch all responses with matching cohort ID\nconst responses = await fetchByCohort(\"philosophy-101-fall-2025\");\n// Display in gallery, even though they're on different sites\nNo central platform. Just convention.\n\nBrowser Extensions\nToday, you could build:\n1. Provenance Checker\n\nReads CRS files\nShows \"✓ Human-made (94%)\" badges\nLets you inspect the proof data\n\n2. Semantic Navigator\n\nReads routing suggestions\nShows \"Related content\" sidebar\nExplains why things are related\n\n3. Curation Reader\n\nHighlights featured content\nShows curator reasoning\nFilters by curator you trust\n\n4. Cohort Aggregator\n\nFinds all responses to a prompt\nDisplays as gallery\nRespects curation decisions\n\nTomorrow, browsers could natively:\n\nShow provenance badges (like HTTPS indicators)\nFollow semantic routing (like \"next chapter\" in ebooks)\nDisplay curation reasoning (like edit history on Wikipedia)\nAggregate by cohort (like RSS readers)\n\n\nThe RSS Parallel\nRSS did this for syndication:\nxml<!-- RSS makes content syndication standard -->\n<rss version=\"2.0\">\n  <channel>\n    <item>\n      <title>My Blog Post</title>\n      <link>https://example.com/post</link>\n      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\nResult: Any feed reader can subscribe to any blog. No platform lock-in.\nCRS does this for context:\ncss/* CRS makes context standard */\n#my-post {\n  provenance: human;\n  curation-featured: true;\n  semantic-topics: \"tech\", \"ethics\";\n  routing-suggests: \"#related-post\" 87%;\n}\nResult: Any browser can understand provenance, curation, relationships. No platform lock-in.\n\nThe Upgrade Path\nPhase 1: Extension (Now)\nBuild browser extensions that read .crs files and enhance pages\nPhase 2: Tools (3 months)\nBuild tools to generate .crs files:\n\nCursive editor exports HTML + CRS\nObsidian plugin generates CRS\nVS Code extension adds CRS to markdown\n\nPhase 3: Libraries (6 months)\nJavaScript libraries to make it easy:\nhtml<script src=\"cursive.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  Cursive.init({\n    provenance: true,\n    curation: true,\n    routing: true\n  });\n</script>\nPhase 4: Browsers (1-2 years)\nBrowsers add native support:\n\nChrome extension API for CRS\nFirefox context API\nSafari semantic navigation\n\nPhase 5: Standard (2-3 years)\nW3C working group:\n\nFormal CRS specification\nTest suite\nMultiple implementations\n\n\nWhy This Could Actually Work\n1. Progressive Enhancement\nWorks without browser support (just HTML). Better with support (provenance badges, smart routing).\n2. No Platform Lock-In\nIt's just files. Put them anywhere. GitHub Pages, your own server, IPFS. They work.\n3. Composes with Existing Web\nNot replacing HTML/CSS/JS. Augmenting it. Existing sites work fine.\n4. Solves Real Problems\n\nProvenance (AI detection)\nCuration (quality over engagement)\nRouting (meaningful connections)\nContext (who is this for?)\n\n5. Gradual Adoption\n\nStart with CRS files (manual)\nAdd browser extension (enhancement)\nTools generate automatically (convenience)\nBrowsers support natively (default)\n\n\nComparison to Your Original Idea\nOriginal: Cursive Platform\nPros: Full control, can innovate fast, cohesive experience\nCons: Platform lock-in, requires adoption of whole system, dies if you stop maintaining\nNew: CRS Extension to Web\nPros: Works anywhere, composes with existing web, survives beyond you, no lock-in\nCons: Slower adoption, requires coordination, less control\n\nThe Answer to Your Question\n\"Could we actually just extend HTML and get a big part of what we're working on?\"\nYes. By adding a context layer (CRS) that handles:\n\n✅ Provenance (proof of human)\n✅ Curation (featured with reasoning)\n✅ Semantic relationships (how things connect)\n✅ Routing (where to go next)\n✅ Context (who is this for)\n\nIt would work like:\n\nCSS (declarative, separate from content, progressively enhanced)\nRSS (standard format, works anywhere, no platform)\n\nYou'd ship:\n\nSpecification (define CRS syntax)\nTools (generate CRS from Cursive editor)\nExtension (read CRS, enhance pages)\nAdvocacy (push for browser support)\n\nThis is actually more ambitious than a platform. You're proposing to extend the web itself.\nShould we spec this out for real?RetryBGhow do we proove who curated what, who people really are? how do people create courses? where are courses found? is it possible to have javascript plugins that transform any text fields into cursive editors? where does the markup go? seems like a lot of technical things to figure outWeighed practical challenges against idealistic protocol vision honestly.17sThe user is rightfully pumping the brakes. They're pointing out all the hard, unsexy problems that make \"just extend HTML\" not so simple:\n\nIdentity - How do you prove who curated what? Who people really are?\nCourse creation - How do people actually make courses? What's the authoring experience?\nDiscovery - Where are courses found? How do people find them?\nTechnical implementation - Can JavaScript transform text fields? Where does markup go?\nGeneral overwhelm - \"Seems like a lot of technical things to figure out\"\n\nThis is the classic moment where a beautiful abstraction meets messy reality. I should:\n\nBe honest about what's hard\nDistinguish between \"can do now\" vs \"needs new infrastructure\"\nShow practical paths forward\nNot hand-wave the identity/trust problem\nBe realistic about adoption challenges\n\nLet me break down each concern:\nIdentity/Curation Proof:\n\nThis IS hard\nOptions: PGP keys, Web of Trust, platform-issued keys, blockchain (ugh)\nReality: most people won't manage keys\nPractical path: Start with platform-issued keys, evolve toward portable keys\n\nCourse Creation:\n\nIf it's \"just files,\" how do you actually make a course?\nNeed authoring tools (not just specs)\nCursive editor could be one, but need others\nReality: Without good authoring tools, specs don't matter\n\nDiscovery:\n\nIf courses are scattered across sites, how do you find them?\nNeed aggregators, directories, search\nThis is the RSS problem all over again (and RSS never fully solved discovery)\nReality: Probably need some centralized discovery even if content is decentralized\n\nTechnical Implementation:\n\nJavaScript that transforms text fields = possible but clunky\nWhere does markup go = in the HTML or in separate files?\nReality: Browser extensions are easier than JavaScript injection\n\nThe Big Picture:\nThey're asking: \"Is this actually simpler than just building a platform?\"\nI see two fundamental paths with clear trade-offs. A platform offers immediate usability but locks users in, while a protocol provides flexibility but demands significant upfront complexity. The protocol approach requires solving challenging infrastructure problems around identity, discovery, and authoring - each presenting substantial technical and user experience hurdles. The platform route looks more pragmatic from a shipping perspective, offering a smoother initial experience at the cost of long-term openness.You're Right. Let's Be Honest About the Hard Parts.\nThis is the moment where beautiful abstraction meets messy reality. Let me break down what's actually hard:\n\nThe Identity Problem (Really Hard)\nQuestion: \"How do we prove who curated what, who people really are?\"\nThe brutal truth: This is the hardest part of the open web.\nOption 1: Platform-Issued Keys (Practical)\nUser signs up on cursive.com\n→ Gets a keypair (managed by platform)\n→ Signs their content: \"signed by alice@cursive.com\"\n→ Anyone can verify it's really alice@cursive.com\n\nProblem: Still requires platform trust\nOption 2: DIY Keys (Principled but Painful)\nUser generates PGP key locally\n→ Signs their content with private key\n→ Publishes public key somewhere\n→ Anyone can verify signature\n\nProblem: 99% of people won't do this\nReality: Only nerds manage PGP keys\nOption 3: Web of Trust (Theoretical)\nAlice vouches for Bob\nBob vouches for Carol\nCarol vouches for David\n→ Trust network emerges\n\nProblem: How do you bootstrap?\nReality: This never really worked for PGP\nOption 4: Platform + Export (Hybrid - Probably Best)\nWhat Cursive could do:\njavascript// User signs up on cursive.com\n// Platform manages keys for them\n// But keys are exportable\n\nuser.export() → {\n  identity: \"alice@cursive.com\",\n  publicKey: \"-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY-----...\",\n  privateKey: \"-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY-----...\" (encrypted),\n  keyDerivation: \"password-based\",\n  backupCodes: [\"abc-123\", \"def-456\"]\n}\nUser experience:\n\nSign up (platform manages keys for you)\nPlatform signs your content automatically\nBut you can export your keys anytime\nTake them to another platform if you want\nOr self-host with your exported keys\n\nThis is how email worked (before it all became Gmail):\n\nStart with hosted email (easy)\nExport your identity if you want to self-host (hard but possible)\nMost people stay hosted, power users self-host\n\nHonest assessment: You probably need to start centralized (Cursive manages keys) and evolve toward decentralization (exportable keys).\n\nThe Course Creation Problem (Medium Hard)\nQuestion: \"How do people create courses?\"\nIf you go the CRS route, you need authoring tools. The spec alone isn't enough.\nBad Answer: \"Just write .crs files by hand\"\ncss/* Nobody will do this */\n#lesson-1 {\n  provenance: human;\n  provenance-fingerprint: \"sha256:abc...\";\n  routing-suggests: \"#lesson-2\" 87%;\n}\n```\n\n### Good Answer: \"Use Cursive Editor (or others)\"\n\n**Cursive Editor could export to open format:**\n```\nCursive Editor (your tool)\n├─ Create course in visual UI\n├─ Write prompts, add routing\n├─ Preview student experience\n└─ Export as:\n   ├─ HTML files (one per prompt)\n   ├─ CRS files (context for each)\n   ├─ manifest.json (course structure)\n   └─ README.md (how to host)\n\nThen deploy to:\n├─ cursive.com (hosted, easy)\n├─ GitHub Pages (static, free)\n├─ Your own server (self-hosted)\n└─ IPFS (decentralized)\n```\n\n**The key insight: You build the authoring tool, but export to open format.**\n\nLike:\n- Figma (centralized tool) exports SVG (open format)\n- VS Code (centralized tool) edits markdown (open format)\n- Obsidian (centralized tool) stores plain text (open format)\n\n**You need to build:**\n1. ✅ Cursive Editor (visual authoring)\n2. ✅ Export to open format (HTML + CRS)\n3. ❓ Import from open format (so others can edit)\n4. ❓ Competing authoring tools (healthy ecosystem)\n\n**Honest assessment:** You still need to build a great authoring tool. The difference is you export to an open format, not a proprietary one.\n\n---\n\n## The Discovery Problem (Really Hard)\n\n**Question:** \"Where are courses found?\"\n\n**This is the RSS problem all over again.** RSS solved syndication but never fully solved discovery.\n\n### Option 1: Central Directory (Practical)\n```\ncursive.com/explore\n├─ Courses directory (curated or algorithmic)\n├─ Submit your course URL\n├─ Platform indexes it\n└─ People discover it\n\nPros: Works, people know where to look\nCons: Creates dependency on cursive.com\n```\n\n### Option 2: Federated Discovery (Principled)\n```\nMultiple directories:\n├─ cursive.com/explore\n├─ education.org/cursive-courses\n├─ myuniversity.edu/open-courses\n└─ Each indexes different courses\n\nYour course submits to multiple directories\nPeople search across directories\n\nPros: No single point of failure\nCons: Fragmented, harder to use\n```\n\n### Option 3: Search Engine (Ideal but Distant)\n```\nGoogle/DuckDuckGo adds support for CRS\nIndexes courses with metadata\nPeople search \"philosophy courses with proof-of-human\"\n\nPros: Truly decentralized discovery\nCons: Requires search engine adoption (years)\n```\n\n### Option 4: Hybrid (Realistic)\n\n**What actually works:**\n```\nPhase 1 (Year 1): Central directory\n├─ cursive.com is the main place to find courses\n├─ You curate featured courses\n├─ Algorithm surfaces good ones\n└─ Easy for users\n\nPhase 2 (Year 2): Federation\n├─ Other platforms add Cursive import\n├─ They run their own directories\n├─ Your directory remains primary but not only\n└─ Cross-platform search starts emerging\n\nPhase 3 (Year 3+): Decentralized\n├─ Search engines index CRS\n├─ Browser extensions add discovery\n├─ No central directory needed\n└─ Truly open ecosystem\nHonest assessment: You probably need cursive.com to be the main discovery hub initially, even if the content format is open. Like GitHub for git repositories - git is open, but GitHub is where people look first.\n\nThe Technical Implementation Problem (Medium Hard)\nQuestion: \"Is it possible to have JavaScript plugins that transform text fields into Cursive editors? Where does markup go?\"\nLet's be specific about what's actually possible:\nApproach 1: Browser Extension (Most Practical)\nWhat it does:\njavascript// Chrome extension watches for contenteditable fields\ndocument.querySelectorAll('[contenteditable]').forEach(field => {\n  if (shouldEnhance(field)) {\n    // Replace with TipTap editor\n    new CursiveEditor(field, {\n      provenance: true,\n      recording: true,\n      exportFormat: 'html+crs'\n    });\n  }\n});\nWhere markup goes:\nhtml<!-- Original page -->\n<textarea id=\"response\"></textarea>\n\n<!-- Extension enhances it -->\n<div class=\"cursive-editor\" data-original=\"response\">\n  <!-- TipTap editor renders here -->\n  <!-- Stroke data saved to localStorage -->\n  <!-- Exports to HTML + CRS when done -->\n</div>\nPros:\n\n✅ Works on any site (Gmail, LMS, forums)\n✅ User opts in (installs extension)\n✅ No site cooperation needed\n\nCons:\n\n❌ Requires browser extension install\n❌ Mobile is harder (extensions limited)\n❌ Each browser needs different extension\n\nRealistic assessment: This could work well for desktop users. Less good for mobile.\nApproach 2: JavaScript Embed (Like Disqus)\nWhat sites would add:\nhtml<div id=\"cursive-editor\"></div>\n<script src=\"https://cursive.com/embed.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  Cursive.render('#cursive-editor', {\n    provenance: true,\n    exportFormat: 'html+crs',\n    onSubmit: (data) => {\n      // Site handles submission\n      submitResponse(data.html, data.crs);\n    }\n  });\n</script>\nPros:\n\n✅ Works on mobile\n✅ Site controls integration\n✅ Can be styled to match site\n\nCons:\n\n❌ Requires site cooperation\n❌ Site needs to handle CRS storage\n❌ Not truly \"transform any text field\"\n\nRealistic assessment: This requires sites to actively adopt it. Doesn't happen magically.\nApproach 3: Bookmarklet (Hacky but Immediate)\nWhat it does:\njavascript// User clicks bookmarklet\n// Injects Cursive editor into page\n// Replaces focused text field\njavascript:(function(){\n  const script = document.createElement('script');\n  script.src = 'https://cursive.com/inject.js';\n  document.head.appendChild(script);\n})();\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- ✅ No extension install\n- ✅ Works immediately\n- ✅ Cross-browser\n\n**Cons:**\n- ❌ Clunky UX (remember to click bookmarklet)\n- ❌ Might break on some sites\n- ❌ Still limited on mobile\n\n**Realistic assessment:** Good for early adopters. Not mainstream.\n\n---\n\n## Where Markup Actually Goes\n\n**The CRS approach has three options:**\n\n### Option A: Separate Files (Clean but Complex)\n```\nmy-response.html        (the content)\nmy-response.crs         (the context)\nmy-response-strokes.json (the proof)\nPros: Clean separation\nCons: Need to keep files together\nOption B: Embedded in HTML (Practical)\nhtml<article data-crs='{\n  \"provenance\": \"human\",\n  \"provenance-fingerprint\": \"sha256:abc...\",\n  \"provenance-data\": \"strokes.json\"\n}'>\n  <p>My response...</p>\n</article>\nPros: Single file\nCons: Clutters HTML\nOption C: Link Header (Web Native)\nhtml<head>\n  <link rel=\"context\" \n        type=\"application/crs+json\"\n        href=\"context.json\">\n</head>\n```\n**Pros:** Web standards compliant\n**Cons:** Requires server support\n\n**Honest answer:** Probably start with Option B (embedded) because it's simplest, evolve to Option C (link header) as you get adoption.\n\n---\n\n## The Honest Comparison\n\nLet me give you the real tradeoffs:\n\n### Building a Platform (Cursive.com)\n\n**Pros:**\n- ✅ You control the whole experience\n- ✅ Identity solved (you manage keys)\n- ✅ Discovery solved (your directory)\n- ✅ Authoring tools work great\n- ✅ Can iterate fast\n- ✅ Can ship in 3-6 months\n\n**Cons:**\n- ❌ Platform lock-in (users trapped)\n- ❌ Single point of failure (if you die, it dies)\n- ❌ You're responsible for everything\n- ❌ Harder to get institutional adoption (\"another platform?\")\n\n### Building a Protocol (CRS Extension)\n\n**Pros:**\n- ✅ No lock-in (truly portable)\n- ✅ Survives beyond you\n- ✅ Can integrate with existing tools\n- ✅ Institutional-friendly (open standards)\n- ✅ Multiple implementations possible\n\n**Cons:**\n- ❌ Identity is hard (key management)\n- ❌ Discovery is hard (no central place)\n- ❌ Requires ecosystem (tools, extensions, adoption)\n- ❌ Slower to ship (12-24 months minimum)\n- ❌ Coordination overhead (specs, standards, politics)\n\n---\n\n## The Realistic Hybrid Path\n\n**What probably actually works:**\n\n### Year 1: Platform First\n```\nBuild cursive.com as a great platform\n├─ Manage keys for users (identity solved)\n├─ Host courses (discovery solved)\n├─ Great authoring tools (creation solved)\n└─ Export to open format (future-proofing)\n\nBut design everything to be exportable:\n├─ HTML + CRS export works from day 1\n├─ Keys are exportable (even if managed)\n├─ Course manifests are portable\n└─ Protocol spec is public\n```\n\n### Year 2: Ecosystem Building\n```\nNow that platform works, enable others:\n├─ Browser extension (read exported courses)\n├─ Import tools (bring courses from other places)\n├─ Alternative hosting (GitHub Pages guide)\n└─ Developer docs (build your own tools)\n\ncursive.com remains primary but not only:\n├─ Best discovery (but not only discovery)\n├─ Best authoring (but not only authoring)\n├─ Best hosting (but not only hosting)\n└─ Reference implementation (but others work)\n```\n\n### Year 3+: Decentralization\n```\nIf you've done it right:\n├─ Other platforms adopt CRS\n├─ Search engines index it\n├─ Multiple authoring tools exist\n└─ You've become optional\n\ncursive.com is now:\n├─ One of many directories\n├─ One of many authoring tools\n├─ One of many hosts\n└─ But the content format is universal\nThis is the email path:\n\nPhase 1: One provider (cursive.com = AOL)\nPhase 2: Multiple providers (universities run their own)\nPhase 3: Protocol is universal (SMTP/CRS is everywhere)\n\n\nWhat to Build First (My Honest Recommendation)\nShip this in 6 months:\n\nCursive Editor (web-based, beautiful)\n\nWrite content with proof-of-human recording\nVisual course builder\nPreview student experience\n\n\nCursive Platform (cursive.com)\n\nHost courses\nManage keys for users\nDirectory of courses\nStudent portfolios\n\n\nOpen Export (future-proofing)\n\nExport course as HTML + CRS + manifest\nDownloadable .cursive.zip\nREADME: \"How to self-host\"\n\n\n\nShip this in 12 months:\n\nBrowser Extension (Chrome + Firefox)\n\nRead exported courses\nVerify signatures\nShow provenance badges\n\n\nImport Tools\n\nImport from Markdown\nImport from Google Docs\nImport from LMS exports\n\n\nFederation Docs\n\nSpec for running your own instance\nAPI for aggregating courses\nGuidelines for course indexing\n\n\n\nShip this in 18-24 months:\n\nAlternative Tools\n\nObsidian plugin (generates CRS)\nVS Code extension (edits courses)\nCLI tools (deploy/validate)\n\n\nDecentralized Discovery\n\nMultiple directories\nSearch engine support\nRSS-like subscription\n\n\n\n\nThe Answer to \"Seems Like a Lot\"\nYou: \"Seems like a lot of technical things to figure out\"\nMe: Yes. It is. Let me be clear:\nIf you want it to be truly open and decentralized from day 1:\n\n👎 That's 2-3 years of work\n👎 Requires coordination with many parties\n👎 Slower to market\n👎 Higher risk of failure\n\nIf you build platform first, open later:\n\n👍 Can ship in 6 months\n👍 Prove the concept works\n👍 Get users now\n👍 Export format keeps door open to decentralization\n👎 Risk of never decentralizing (Gmail effect)\n\nMy recommendation: Build the platform, but design for export from day 1.\nLike:\n\nFigma (centralized) but exports SVG (open)\nNotion (centralized) but exports Markdown (open)\nObsidian (centralized) but stores plain text (open)\n\nThe test: If cursive.com disappeared tomorrow, could users take their content and run it elsewhere?\nIf yes → you've succeeded at portability even if centralized\nIf no → you've built a prison\n\nSo What Should You Actually Build?\nThe honest answer:\nStart with a platform (cursive.com) that:\n\nWorks great (best-in-class UX)\nSolves real problems (proof-of-human, curation, facilitation)\nExports to open format (HTML + CRS + keys)\n\nThen evolve toward decentralization:\n\nExtension reads exports\nOthers can host courses\nFormat becomes standard\nYou become optional\n\nDon't try to build the open web version first. Build something that works, then make it portable.\nSound right?"

Requires human action for content creation\n\n### Test Suite (Future)\n\n```bash\ncursive-protocol-test --level core ./my-implementation\ncursive-protocol-test --level hospitality ./my-implementation\n```\n\n---\n\n## Versioning\n\n### Current: v0.1 (Draft)\n- CPL page format\n- CHL invitation format\n- Export manifest\n- Fingerprint algorithm\n\n### Planned: v0.2\n- Federation protocol\n- Cross-instance consent\n- Canonical identifiers\n\n### Planned: v1.0\n- Finalized specs\n- Compliance test suite\n- Multiple reference implementations\n\n---\n\n## Governance\n\n### Specification Process\n\n1. **Proposal** - GitHub issue or RFC\n2. **Discussion** - Community feedback\n3. **Draft** - Specification document\n4. **Implementation** - Reference implementation\n5. **Finalized** - Version number assigned\n\n### Backwards Compatibility\n\n- Breaking changes require major version bump\n- Implementations should support N-1 versions\n- Export format includes version number\n\n---\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### Fingerprint Spoofing\n\n**Attack:** Generate synthetic content with fake timestamps\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Use cryptographic signatures\n- Require device attestation (optional)\n- Cross-reference multiple sessions\n- Human verification as fallback\n\n### Cross-Site Transclusion\n\n**Attack:** Embed malicious content via transclusion\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Require explicit consent\n- Sandbox transcluded content\n- Show clear attribution\n- Allow blocking by domain\n\n### Privacy\n\n**Concern:** Process fingerprints reveal too much\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- User controls fingerprint visibility\n- Can share page without process data\n- Coarse timestamps (minute-level, not millisecond)\n- Aggregated metrics only\n\n---\n\n## Philosophical Foundation\n\n### Why This Protocol Exists\n\nIn an age of:\n- Effortless AI content generation\n- Engagement-optimized platforms\n- Algorithmic feeds and dark patterns\n- Unclear authorship and provenance\n\nWe need a protocol that:\n- Proves human authorship\n- Preserves process and craft\n- Respects user sovereignty\n- Prioritizes meaning over metrics\n\n### Core Values\n\n1. **Qualitative over Quantitative** - Experience > engagement metrics\n2. **Embodied over Abstract** - Bodies, places, hands matter\n3. **Competence over Automation** - Tools scaffold skill, don't replace it\n4. **Hospitality over Hostility** - Human hosts, not algorithms\n5. **Craft over Convenience** - Process as proof, effort as value\n6. **Sovereignty over Captivity** - Export everything, move anywhere\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Q: Why not use ActivityPub?\n**A:** ActivityPub is for social networking. Cursive Protocol is for human-authored content with verifiable provenance. Different concerns.\n\n### Q: Why not blockchain/web3?\n**A:** Cursive works with or without blockchain. Provenance is cryptographic but doesn't require distributed ledger. Can add later.\n\n### Q: Can AI use Cursive Protocol?\n**A:** Yes, but AI-generated content must be marked `origin: \"synthetic\"`. The protocol is neutral but transparent.\n\n### Q: Is this anti-AI?\n**A:** No. It's pro-human. AI can assist (marked `ai-assisted`), but cannot autonomously author pages marked `human`.\n\n### Q: Who owns this protocol?\n**A:** It's open. Like HTTP or HTML, anyone can implement. Specification is MIT licensed.\n\n---\n\n## Conformance Statement\n\nAn implementation claiming **Cursive Protocol v0.1 compliance** MUST:\n\n1. Support CPL page format (JSON)\n2. Include provenance metadata on all pages\n3. Export to `.cursive` archive format\n4. Display origin badges (human/ai-assisted/synthetic)\n5. Require human authentication for page creation\n6. Preserve fingerprint evidence (if Level 3)\n\nAn implementation MAY additionally:\n- Support CHL hospitality format\n- Calculate human fingerprints\n- Enable federation (future)\n- Add custom block types (namespaced)\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nCursive Protocol Specification: **CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)**\n\nReference implementations may use any license.\n\n---\n\n## Contact\n\n- **Specification:** github.com/cursive-protocol/spec\n- **Discussion:** github.com/cursive-protocol/spec/discussions\n- **Reference App:** (separate repository)\n\n---\n\n**This is Cursive Protocol v0.1.

      "content": "The user is asking for help with their pitch/positioning for Cursive. They're drowning in details and struggling to identify what's most important. Let me break down what they're mentioning:\n\n1. Auto navigation (pages that know themselves and you + navigation/tools)\n2. Handwriting embodiment\n3. No images - proof of human origin\n4. Craft\n5. \"Page object\" metaphor - like a pinball ball with interesting properties\n\nThey want to pitch to:\n- Schools\n- People sick of social media\n- Facilitators of online experiences (using Circle)\n\nThey also ask: protocol vs. app?\n\nLooking at their manifesto and values, the core insight is about **proof of humanity in an age of AI**. But they're building it through a specific lens - not just \"detect AI\" but \"celebrate human craft.\"\n\nLet me think about what's actually most important:\n\n**The Core Problem They're Solving:**\nIn an AI-saturated world, how do you prove something is authentically human-made? Not just \"not AI\" but \"made with human hands, time, thought, and effort\"?\n\n**Their Solution's Key Insight:**\nProcess creates proof. The *how* of making something is what proves it's human. AI can fake outputs but can't fake the messy, variable, iterative process of human creation.\n\n**The Pinball Metaphor:**\nThey mention a \"page object\" like a pinball ball - metal, can be magnetized, rolls fun and bouncy, has interesting properties. This is actually brilliant. A page in Cursive isn't just content, it's an object with:\n- Mass (took time to make)\n- Material properties (stroke data, process fingerprint)\n- Can interact with other objects (routing, tools, transclusions)\n- Has physics (can't fake the process)\n\n**What's Most Important:**\nLooking at the manifesto, I think the most important thing is the **shift from outputs to process**. Everything else flows from this:\n\n- Handwriting/embodiment → captures process\n\n\n- No images → forces human creation process\n- Craft → values process over product\n- Auto-navigation → uses process data to understand you\n- Proof-of-human → fingerprint of process\n\n**For Different Audiences:**\n\nSchools are desperate to combat AI-driven academic dishonesty. Cursive offers a radical solution: revealing the entire creative journey. Students can't simply generate a final product; their work becomes a transparent narrative of learning and effort. The platform transforms assessment from a static endpoint to a dynamic exploration of intellectual growth.\n\nSocial media refugees crave authentic connection. Cursive promises an escape from algorithmic manipulation, offering a space where human creativity isn't just a commodity. It's a sanctuary where the messy, imperfect process of creation matters more than polished, AI-generated perfection.\n\nA human-crafted digital environment emerges, calm and intentional. No engagement metrics, no algorithmic pressure—just pure, traceable human creativity. The platform becomes a calm workshop where process is the true product.\n\nFacilitators find a powerful tool for maintaining genuine human connection. By preserving and showcasing participant journeys, they can prove the depth and quality of collaborative work. The platform respects human rhythms, transforming group interactions from transactional to transformative.\n\nThe vision oscillates between practical app and future protocol. Currently, they're building a functional application with export capabilities, similar to Figma's design approach. Their long-term goal is a protocol, but they wisely prioritize creating a working, user-friendly platform first.\n\nThe roadmap involves:\n1. Crafting a compelling core narrative\n2. Tailoring audience-specific entry points\n3. Developing the innovative pinball metaphor\n4. Clarifying the app-to-protocol transition strategyYou're drowning in details because you're building something genuinely new, and **the frame doesn't exist yet**. Let me help you find it.\n\n## The Core Insight (One Sentence)\n\n**In an age of AI that can fake any output, the only proof of humanity is process.**\n\nThat's it. Everything else in Cursive is a consequence of that insight.\n\n## The Pinball Metaphor (This Is Good, Keep It)\n\nA Cursive page isn't a document, it's an **object with mass and memory**:\n\n- It has **weight** (took time to make)\n- It has **fingerprints** (stroke patterns you can't fake)\n- It has **magnetism** (attracts related content via semantic similarity)\n- It **bounces** (routing logic sends you places based on what it learned about you)\n- It has **physics** (can't violate causality - edits come after creation, pauses reveal thinking)\n\nA Google Doc is weightless. A Cursive page has **material properties**.\n\n## What's Actually Most Important (For Each Audience)\n\n### For Schools: \"See How They Thought, Not Just What They Wrote\"\n\n**The pain:** AI plagiarism + you can't tell if students learned anything\n\n**The insight:** Assessment should reward *understanding*, not just correct answers\n\n**What Cursive does:**\n- Shows the **creation timeline** (when they paused, what they revised, how long they spent)\n- Embeds **assessments in the content itself** (rubric is transparent, logic is visible)\n- Routes students who struggle to **remedial content automatically**\n- Gives teachers a **\"rewind button\"** - watch how the student thought\n\n**The pitch:**\n> \"Instead of grading outputs, grade understanding. See when they got stuck, where they self-corrected, what they revised. The process *is* the proof they learned.\"\n\n**Why it matters:** Students can't fake the messy, iterative process of actually learning something.\n\n---\n\n### For People Sick of Social Media: \"The Anti-Feed\"\n\n**The pain:** Everything feels fake, algorithmic, engagement-optimized\n\n**The insight:** You want a place where everything is **provably human** and **calm by design**\n\n**What Cursive does:**\n- **No infinite scroll** (pages have edges, like real paper)\n- **No engagement metrics** (no likes, no follower counts)\n- **No algorithmic feed** (you navigate via meaning, not virality)\n- **Proof-of-human badges** (you can see that someone actually made this with their hands)\n\n**The pitch:**\n> \"A journal that proves it's yours. A publishing platform where craft matters more than clicks. The hostile web has infinite scroll; we have edges.\"\n\n**Why it matters:** In a sea of AI slop, human-made content becomes valuable again.\n\n---\n\n### For Facilitators (Circle refugees): \"Facilitation That Respects Human Rhythms\"\n\n**The pain:** Scaling connection without losing intimacy; proving participants did the work\n\n**The insight:** **Hosts should guide, software should support** (not replace)\n\n**What Cursive does:**\n- **Email-based releases** (you approve every send, software never auto-posts)\n- **Process receipts** (participants can prove they did the work - with fingerprints)\n- **Pause/resume cycles** (take a vacation, pick up where you left off)\n- **Cohort galleries** (see everyone's work + creation process)\n\n**The pitch:**\n> \"Circle gives you a feed and hopes you fill it. Cursive gives you a rhythm: you send prompts, participants respond with their hands, you see both the work and the process. No automation pretending to be human.\"\n\n**Why it matters:** Your facilitation becomes **verifiable** - participants leave with proof they engaged deeply.\n\n---\n\n## The Frame That Doesn't Exist Yet\n\nYou're trying to say \"pages with interesting properties\" but the world thinks in:\n- Documents (Google Docs)\n- Posts (social media)\n- Assignments (LMS)\n\n**Cursive pages are none of these.** They're closer to:\n- **Lab notebooks** (provenance + process)\n- **Artisan signatures** (craft + verification)\n- **Chess recordings** (every move logged, replayable)\n\nThe closest metaphor: **\"Handmade goods in a factory world\"**\n\nWhen everything can be mass-produced (AI-generated), handmade becomes valuable. Cursive is the \"handmade\" certification for digital content.\n\n---\n\n## Protocol vs. App: The Honest Answer\n\n**Right now:** You're building an app (cursive.com)\n\n**Long-term:** You want to be a protocol (like email)\n\n**The path:**\n1. **Year 1:** Ship the app, prove it works, get users\n2. **Year 2:** Export to open format (HTML + CRS), let others host\n3. **Year 3:** Become optional (others can build compatible tools)\n\n**Like email:**\n- Started centralized (one provider)\n- Became protocol (SMTP)\n- Now universal (anyone can run a server)\n\n**The test:** If cursive.com disappeared, could users take their content elsewhere?\n\n**Design for that from day 1** (export to `.cursive` archives), but ship a great app first.\n\n---\n\n## The Pitch Framework (For Anyone)\n\n### Problem\n[Pick one based on audience]\n- Schools: \"AI plagiarism makes assessment meaningless\"\n- Consumers: \"Everything online feels fake and manipulative\"\n- Facilitators: \"Can't scale human connection without losing quality\"\n\n### Insight\n**Process creates proof.** AI can fake outputs but can't fake the messy, variable, human process of creation.\n\n### What Cursive Does\n[Pick 3 most relevant features]\n- Captures creation process (every keystroke, every pause)\n- Shows proof-of-human badges (confidence scores, verifiable)\n- Routes you intelligently (pages know you + themselves)\n- Requires human facilitation (hosts approve, software reminds)\n\n### Why It Matters\n[The transformation]\n- Schools: \"Grade understanding, not outputs\"\n- Consumers: \"Own your work, prove it's yours\"\n- Facilitators: \"Scale without losing humanity\"\n\n---\n\n## What to Lead With (My Recommendation)\n\n**Don't lead with features. Lead with the transformation.**\n\n### For Schools:\n> \"What if you could see *how* students think, not just *what* they write? Cursive turns assessment from 'did you get the right answer' to 'do you understand the concept' - because you can watch them work.\"\n\n### For Consumers:\n> \"In a world of AI-generated everything, how do you prove something is yours? Cursive gives your work a fingerprint - a process signature that says 'a human made this with their hands.'\"\n\n### For Facilitators:\n> \"What if facilitation software helped you host, instead of replacing you? Cursive gives you the rhythm of great teaching - you send prompts, people respond with proof of engagement, you see both product and process.\"\n\n---\n\n## The One-Liner You Need\n\n**\"Cursive proves you made it.\"**\n\nThat's it. Everything else is how.\n\n- Made it with your hands (handwriting/drawing)\n- Made it over time (process fingerprint)\n- Made it with thought (pause patterns, revisions)\n\nIn an AI world, **proof of making** is the new premium.\n\n---\n\n## Are You a Protocol or an App?\n\n**Both, eventually.**\n\n**Phase 1 (now):** App that works great\n**Phase 2:** App that exports to open format\n**Phase 3:** Format becomes standard, you become optional\n\n**Like:**\n- Figma (app) → exports SVG (protocol)\n- Obsidian (app) → stores markdown (protocol)\n- Email (was app) → became SMTP (protocol)\n\n**Ship the app. Design for the protocol. Become optional later.**\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** You're not building better Google Docs. You're building **the handmade certification for digital content**. In an AI-saturated world, that's the only thing that matters.\n\nDoes this help clarify the pitch?",

Cursive is the \"handmade\" certification for digital content.\n\n---\n\n## Protocol vs. App: The Honest Answer\n\n**Right now:** You're building an app (cursive.com)\n\n**Long-term:** You want to be a protocol (like email)\n\n**The path:**\n1. **Year 1:** Ship the app, prove it works, get users\n2. **Year 2:** Export to open format (HTML + CRS), let others host\n3. **Year 3:** Become optional (others can build compatible tools)\n\n**Like email:**\n- Started centralized (one provider)\n- Became protocol (SMTP)\n- Now universal (anyone can run a server)\n\n**The test:** If cursive.com disappeared, could users take their content elsewhere?\n\n**Design for that from day 1** (export to `.cursive` archives), but ship a great app first.\n\n---\n\n## The Pitch Framework (For Anyone)\n\n### Problem\n[Pick one based on audience]\n- Schools: \"AI plagiarism makes assessment meaningless\"\n- Consumers: \"Everything online feels fake and manipulative\"\n- Facilitators: \"Can't scale human connection without losing quality\"\n\n### Insight\n**Process creates proof.** AI can fake outputs but can't fake the messy, variable, human process of creation.\n\n### What Cursive Does\n[Pick 3 most relevant features]\n- Captures creation process (every keystroke, every pause)\n- Shows proof-of-human badges (confidence scores, verifiable)\n- Routes you intelligently (pages know you + themselves)\n- Requires human facilitation (hosts approve, software reminds)\n\n### Why It Matters\n[The transformation]\n- Schools: \"Grade understanding, not outputs\"\n- Consumers: \"Own your work, prove it's yours\"\n- Facilitators: \"Scale without losing humanity\"\n\n---\n\n## What to Lead With (My Recommendation)\n\n**Don't lead with features. Lead with the transformation.**\n\n### For Schools:\n> \"What if you could see *how* students think, not just *what* they write? Cursive turns assessment from 'did you get the right answer' to 'do you understand the concept' - because you can watch them work.\"\n\n### For Consumers:\n> \"In a world of AI-generated everything, how do you prove something is yours? Cursive gives your work a fingerprint - a process signature that says 'a human made this with their hands.'\"\n\n### For Facilitators:\n> \"What if facilitation software helped you host, instead of replacing you? Cursive gives you the rhythm of great teaching - you send prompts, people respond with proof of engagement, you see both product and process.\"\n\n---\n\n## The One-Liner You Need\n\n**\"Cursive proves you made it.\"**\n\nThat's it. Everything else is how.\n\n- Made it with your hands (handwriting/drawing)\n- Made it over time (process fingerprint)\n- Made it with thought (pause patterns, revisions)\n\nIn an AI world, **proof of making** is the new premium.\n\n---\n\n## Are You a Protocol or an App?\n\n**Both, eventually.**\n\n**Phase 1 (now):** App that works great\n**Phase 2:** App that exports to open format\n**Phase 3:** Format becomes standard, you become optional\n\n**Like:**\n- Figma (app) → exports SVG (protocol)\n- Obsidian (app) → stores markdown (protocol)\n- Email (was app) → became SMTP (protocol)\n\n**Ship the app. Design for the protocol. Become optional later.**\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** You're not building better Google Docs. You're building **the handmade certification for digital content**. In an AI-saturated world, that's the only thing that matters.\n\nDoes this help clarify the pitch?",
