      "content": "In European electrical systems, the color coding for wires typically follows this standard:\n\n- **Red or Brown**: Live or Phase wire (current carrying)\n- **Blue**: Neutral wire (returns the current to the source)\n- **Yellow/Green**: Ground or Earth wire (safety mechanism)\n\nIt's always important to consult local codes and regulations, as color coding can vary slightly by country or region within Europe.",
