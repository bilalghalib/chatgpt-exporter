Some popular choices for beginners include:\n\n- **Python**: Known for its simplicity and readability.\n- **JavaScript**: Great for learning web development concepts.\n- **Scratch**: A visual, block-based programming tool, excellent for younger learners.\n- **C++/Java**: For those interested in more structured or object-oriented programming.\n\nLet me know your preference, or if you'd like suggestions based on your audience!",
