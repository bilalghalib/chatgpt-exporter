      "content": "The hadith you are referring to aligns with the principle in Islamic jurisprudence that emphasizes the importance of lawful (halal) means in achieving lawful ends. While there isn't a direct hadith that states *\"What ends in haram is haram itself\"* in those exact words, the concept is derived from broader Islamic principles and teachings.\n\n### Relevant Hadith and Teachings:\n1. **Means to Haram are Haram**:\n   - The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:  \n     > **\"Indeed, Allah is pure and accepts only what is pure.\"**  \n     (Sahih Muslim, Book 12, Hadith 2214)  \n     This emphasizes that the methods and means must also be pure and lawful to be acceptable to Allah.\n\n2. **The Principle of Avoiding Doubtful Matters**:\n   - The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:  \n     > **\"That which is lawful is clear, and that which is unlawful is clear, and between the two of them are doubtful matters about which many people do not know. Thus, he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honor.\"**  \n     (Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim)\n\n3. **Prohibition of Facilitating Haram**:\n   - Facilitating haram acts, even indirectly, is also prohibited in Islam. For instance, in the Qur'an, Allah says:  \n     > **\"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.\"**  \n     (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:2)\n\n### Jurisprudential Principle:\nThe principle \"What leads to haram is itself haram\" (*ما أدى إلى الحرام فهو حرام*) is derived from Islamic legal theory (usul al-fiqh). This means if a permissible act directly leads to an impermissible (haram) outcome, that act also becomes impermissible.\n\n### Practical Example:\nIf earning money through interest (riba) is haram, then actions that directly lead to riba, like facilitating an interest-based loan, would also be considered haram.\n\nIf you are looking for a more specific reference or application, let me know, and I can assist further.",
