      "content": "To find out how much **gold 1,000 Iraqi dinars (IQD)** would have bought in **July 1980**, we need to look at two key pieces of data from that time:\n\n### 1. **Official Exchange Rate of the Iraqi Dinar (1980)**\nIn 1980, the **Iraqi dinar was strong and relatively stable**, pegged to the U.S. dollar. The **official exchange rate was around 1 IQD = $3.22 USD**.\n\nSo:\n- 1,000 IQD × $3.22 = **$3,220 USD** in July 1980.\n\n### 2. **Gold Price in July 1980**\nAfter peaking in January 1980 at around **$850/oz**, gold prices declined mid-year. In **July 1980**, the average price of gold was around **$650 per ounce**.\n\n### Calculation:\n- $3,220 ÷ $650 per oz = **~4.95 ounces of gold**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**In July 1980, 1,000 Iraqi dinars could have bought approximately 4.95 ounces of gold.**\n\nLet me know if you’d like this adjusted for inflation or converted to today's gold value.",
