      "content": "It appears that the document you've uploaded is an image file. I am unable to directly extract text from images. However, you can use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to convert the handwritten text in the image into machine-readable text.\n\nThere are many OCR tools available online, both free and paid, that can process images and extract text. Some popular ones include Adobe Acrobat, Google Docs, and various smartphone apps designed for OCR purposes. Simply upload the image to one of these tools, and it should be able to provide you with the text. If you encounter any issues with the handwriting being difficult to read, some tools offer the ability to manually correct errors in the extracted text.",
