Introduction**\n\nThis proposal outlines a strategy to integrate climate resilience practices into the existing Five One Labs Incubator Curriculum while maintaining its core entrepreneurial focus. The goal is not to create a \"green business\" program but rather to ensure that businesses emerging from the incubator are resilient, competitive, and prepared for the evolving economic and environmental landscape of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region (KRI), living in the reality of the fact of climate change. \n\nThis approach aligns with global best practices while remaining locally relevant. It leverages the Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a framing tool to embed climate-aware business strategies without disrupting the curriculum’s structure.\n\n---\n\n## **2\\. Approach: Building Climate-Resilient Entrepreneurs**\n\n### **Framing Climate Resilience as Business Resilience**\n\nInstead of presenting climate adaptation as an environmental initiative, we will position it as a necessary component of modern business strategy.\n\nThis may require an additional section in the curriculum supporting this realization and opening the connection between climate and successful business strategy. Entrepreneurs will learn to:\n\n* **Anticipate shifts in market demand, supply chains, and consumer preferences** due to rising energy costs and environmental factors.  \n* **Develop business models that remain viable in an increasingly resource-constrained world.**  \n* **Identify funding and investment opportunities** linked to sustainability, such as impact investing and climate adaptation grants.\n\n### **Key Principles of Integration**\n\n1. **Embedded, Not Added**  \n   * Climate resilience is not a standalone topic—it is integrated into **market research, financial planning, business model design, and operations**.  \n2. **Real-World Examples**  \n   * Case studies will highlight businesses in Iraq, KRI, and internationally that have successfully adapted to climate challenges.  \n3. **Flexibility & Feasibility**  \n   * Entrepreneurs will be introduced to **staged adaptation strategies**, allowing them to implement **small, cost-effective changes now**, with a roadmap for scaling up over time.  \n4. **Risk Management as a Core Business Skill**  \n   * Businesses will learn how to **monitor environmental and economic risks** and adjust their models accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## **3\\.

Comprehensive Curriculum Alignment Table**\n\nThe following tables explore the alignment against current best practices and tables, including the ILO, the UN, and others. This is a living document and is expected to grow and change. \n\nThis table aligns the incubator curriculum modules with their original comments, ILO recommendations, Business Model Canvas (BMC) components, and relevant Iraqi climate considerations. It ensures that each module is updated to reflect resilience and future-proofing strategies.\n\n| Curriculum Module | Curriculum Comments | ILO Recommendation | BMC Component | Iraqi Climate Issues | Mitigation & Consideration |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Market Research & Business Strategy** | Needs stronger connection to local challenges, market shifts, and external risks. | Market awareness of green opportunities and risks | Market Awareness (Customer Segments & Value Proposition) | Rising energy costs, water scarcity, supply chain disruptions affecting local and imported goods | Introduce future trend analysis, risk-based market research, and consumer demand shifts in the Iraqi and KRI context. |\n| **Supply Chain & Procurement** | Little focus on long-term sourcing risks, no adaptation for climate-induced material costs. | Sustainable supply chain & procurement | Key Resources & Key Partners | Limited local production, reliance on imported raw materials, supply chain instability due to geopolitical risks | Train entrepreneurs to assess supplier vulnerabilities, build alternative supplier networks, and explore sustainable sourcing strategies. |\n| **Operations & Cost Management** | Energy costs expected to rise, but no training on efficiency strategies. | Cost efficiency through energy & resource management | Cost Structure & Operations | Unstable electricity supply, increased water costs, inefficiencies in business operations due to infrastructure limitations | Introduce staged energy efficiency adaptations, water conservation strategies, and lean operations to manage costs. |\n| **Risk & Crisis Management** | Crisis planning focuses on financial risks but lacks environmental risk consideration. | Risk mitigation & climate adaptation | Risk Mitigation (Key Activities & Revenue Streams) | Extreme weather events (flooding, heat waves), regulatory uncertainty, economic instability | Expand risk assessment frameworks to include climate risks, geopolitical instability, and business continuity planning. |\n| **Finance & Investment** | Financial strategy is limited to traditional funding options; no ESG or resilience-focused investments are mentioned. | Access to green finance and resilience-linked investment | Financial Strategy & Revenue Streams | Limited access to alternative financing, rising cost of credit, emerging green investment opportunities | Introduce awareness of impact investment, resilience-based grants, and government incentives for sustainable business models. |\n| **Policy & Regulatory Compliance** | No reference to potential regulatory shifts (e.g., carbon taxes, energy incentives). | Policy adaptation & regulatory awareness | Policy Adaptation (Key Activities & Cost Structure) | Unpredictable government policies, potential energy tariffs, evolving regulations on emissions and environmental practices | Equip entrepreneurs with tools to track policy changes and integrate compliance strategies into business models. |\n| **Sales, Marketing & Branding** | Marketing focuses on differentiation but does not acknowledge sustainability trends in consumer preferences. | Consumer behavior & branding for resilience | Customer Relationships & Channels | Changing consumer expectations, increasing demand for sustainable and locally sourced products | Teach entrepreneurs how to integrate sustainability messaging into their branding and consumer engagement strategies. |\n\nThis structured alignment ensures that the Five One Labs Incubator Curriculum remains practical, relevant, and adaptable to future climate and business challenges in Iraq and the Kurdistan Region (KRI).\n\n## **5\\. Five-Cluster Curriculum**\n\nIn addition to our rubric-based updates, we’ve developed a five-cluster curriculum framework to systematically integrate climate resilience throughout all 32 modules. This approach:\n\n* References **ILO Green Business Booklet** and **GreenComp**  \n* Maps each of the 32 modules five clusters:  \n  * Cluster A: Market Research & Customer Development  \n  * Cluster B: Business Model & Operations  \n  * Cluster C: Finance & Impact  \n  * Cluster D: Team & Leadership  \n  * Cluster E: Growth & Innovation\n\n### **5\\. 1 Master Table: Alignment With ILO & Greencomp**\n\n**Master Curriculum Alignment Table**\n\n| Original Module | Client's Green Suggestions | Aligned Cluster | Key Tools/Worksheets | Implementation Notes |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **1\\.

Green School Quality Standard: Greening Every Learning Environment**\n\nLink: [here](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000390028)\n\n| Green School Quality Standard Recommendations | Proposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum | Alignment & Improvement Suggestions |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Develop a Green School Action Plan** *(Clear steps, responsibilities, and monitoring for sustainability initiatives)* | \\- The proposal outlines a structured **Implementation Timeline** for integrating climate resilience into the incubator curriculum. \\- The **Curriculum Integration Strategy** identifies specific intervention points in the Business Model Canvas (BMC). | ✅ **Partial Alignment** – The proposal includes structured phases, but it lacks explicit monitoring and evaluation plans to track progress. ➡ **Recommendation**: Introduce a progress tracking mechanism (e.g., feedback loops, sustainability progress dashboard for businesses). |\n| **Monitor and Evaluate Progress** *(SMART targets, periodic evaluations, and avoiding greenwashing)* | \\- The proposal includes **rubric-based evaluations** for assessing resilience in the curriculum. \\- **Key Deliverables** mention an assessment of 32 curriculum sessions for improvement. | ✅ **Alignment with improvement potential** – The proposal addresses evaluation, but it doesn’t mention specific key performance indicators (KPIs) or methods for tracking business adaptation over time. ➡ **Recommendation**: Develop clear KPIs such as: \\- % of businesses implementing climate resilience strategies \\- Success rates in securing climate-linked investments \\- Reduction in operational costs through energy efficiency |\n| **Foster Community Engagement** *(Sharing

            "extracted_content": "## **Proposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum**\n\n**Submitted by: Bilal Ghalib**  \n**To: Five One Labs**  \n**Date: 06 February 2025**\n\n---\n\n## **1\\. Introduction**\n\nThis proposal outlines a strategy to integrate climate resilience practices into the existing Five One Labs Incubator Curriculum while maintaining its core entrepreneurial focus. The goal is not to create a \"green business\" program but rather to ensure that businesses emerging from the incubator are resilient, competitive, and prepared for the evolving economic and environmental landscape of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region (KRI), living in the reality of the fact of climate change. \n\nThis approach aligns with global best practices while remaining locally relevant. It leverages the Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a framing tool to embed climate-aware business strategies without disrupting the curriculum’s structure.\n\n---\n\n## **2\\. Approach: Building Climate-Resilient Entrepreneurs**\n\n### **Framing Climate Resilience as Business Resilience**\n\nInstead of presenting climate adaptation as an environmental initiative, we will position it as a necessary component of modern business strategy.\n\nThis may require an additional section in the curriculum supporting this realization and opening the connection between climate and successful business strategy. Entrepreneurs will learn to:\n\n* **Anticipate shifts in market demand, supply chains, and consumer preferences** due to rising energy costs and environmental factors.  \n* **Develop business models that remain viable in an increasingly resource-constrained world.**  \n* **Identify funding and investment opportunities** linked to sustainability, such as impact investing and climate adaptation grants.\n\n### **Key Principles of Integration**\n\n1. **Embedded, Not Added**  \n   * Climate resilience is not a standalone topic—it is integrated into **market research, financial planning, business model design, and operations**.  \n2. **Real-World Examples**  \n   * Case studies will highlight businesses in Iraq, KRI, and internationally that have successfully adapted to climate challenges.  \n3. **Flexibility & Feasibility**  \n   * Entrepreneurs will be introduced to **staged adaptation strategies**, allowing them to implement **small, cost-effective changes now**, with a roadmap for scaling up over time.  \n4. **Risk Management as a Core Business Skill**  \n   * Businesses will learn how to **monitor environmental and economic risks** and adjust their models accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## **3\\.

Green School Quality Standard: Greening Every Learning Environment**\n\nLink: [here](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000390028)\n\n| Green School Quality Standard Recommendations | Proposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum | Alignment & Improvement Suggestions |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Develop a Green School Action Plan** *(Clear steps, responsibilities, and monitoring for sustainability initiatives)* | \\- The proposal outlines a structured **Implementation Timeline** for integrating climate resilience into the incubator curriculum. \\- The **Curriculum Integration Strategy** identifies specific intervention points in the Business Model Canvas (BMC). | ✅ **Partial Alignment** – The proposal includes structured phases, but it lacks explicit monitoring and evaluation plans to track progress. ➡ **Recommendation**: Introduce a progress tracking mechanism (e.g., feedback loops, sustainability progress dashboard for businesses). |\n| **Monitor and Evaluate Progress** *(SMART targets, periodic evaluations, and avoiding greenwashing)* | \\- The proposal includes **rubric-based evaluations** for assessing resilience in the curriculum. \\- **Key Deliverables** mention an assessment of 32 curriculum sessions for improvement. | ✅ **Alignment with improvement potential** – The proposal addresses evaluation, but it doesn’t mention specific key performance indicators (KPIs) or methods for tracking business adaptation over time. ➡ **Recommendation**: Develop clear KPIs such as: \\- % of businesses implementing climate resilience strategies \\- Success rates in securing climate-linked investments \\- Reduction in operational costs through energy efficiency |\n| **Foster Community Engagement** *(Sharing sustainability best practices with the broader community)* | \\- The proposal includes **case studies** showcasing climate-resilient businesses in Iraq and internationally. \\- Additional services include **business resilience coaching** and **policy & regulatory reports**. | ✅ **Good Alignment** – The proposal focuses on community learning through real-world case studies. ➡ **Recommendation**: Encourage peer learning and networking among entrepreneurs through sustainability forums, mentorship programs, or incubator alumni engagement. |\n| **Improve Facilities and Operations** *(Water conservation, waste management, and infrastructure improvements for climate resilience)* | \\- The proposal focuses on **business operations** (lean operations, energy efficiency, sustainable supply chains). | ✅ **Alignment in a business context** – While the proposal integrates climate-conscious business operations, it doesn’t explicitly address waste management or water conservation. ➡ **Recommendation**: Include training modules on circular economy principles and green infrastructure for businesses. |\n| **Enhance Teaching and Learning** *(Integrate sustainability across subjects, participatory learning, hands-on projects)* | \\- Climate resilience is **embedded across business modules**, not treated as an isolated topic. \\- Uses **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** as a practical tool for integration. | ✅ **Strong Alignment** – The curriculum ensures climate resilience is a core business skill. ➡ **Enhancement**: Incorporate experiential learning, such as business simulations, hands-on resilience-building exercises, and real-time problem-solving workshops. |\n| **Strengthen Policy and Stakeholder Engagement** *(Stakeholder workshops, engagement with indigenous knowledge, advocacy training)* | \\- The proposal includes a **Policy & Regulatory Landscape Report** to guide entrepreneurs on compliance and future climate policies. | ✅ **Good Alignment** – Addresses policy adaptation but lacks a community advocacy component. ➡ **Recommendation**: Introduce policy roundtables or stakeholder dialogues for entrepreneurs to actively engage in policy discussions on climate resilience. |\n| **Address Climate Resilience and Disaster Preparedness** *(Emergency planning, climate risk reduction strategies)* | \\- The proposal integrates **risk management as a business skill**, helping businesses anticipate and mitigate climate risks. | ✅ **Strong Alignment** – The curriculum tackles climate risks through business continuity planning. ➡ **Enhancement**: Add disaster preparedness training (e.g., what to do in case of climate-induced supply chain disruptions or extreme weather events). |\n\n#### \n\n#### \n\n### Annex 2:\n\n#### **Climate Resilience in Incubator Curriculum vs. GreenComp: The European Sustainability Competence Framework**\n\nLink: [here](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/greencomp-european-sustainability-competence-framework_en)\n\n| GreenComp Competence Area | Proposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum | Alignment & Improvement Suggestions |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Embodying Sustainability Values** *(Understanding ecological limits, fairness, and justice in sustainability)* | \\- Focuses on **financial risk, supply chain adaptation, and business continuity**. \\- Sustainability is framed as a **business strategy**, but ethical and social justice aspects are not emphasized. | ✅ **Partial Alignment** – The proposal integrates sustainability but does not explicitly address fairness and social justice in business models. ➡ **Recommendation**: Expand on ethical decision-making and incorporate regenerative business models that prioritize fair trade, equity, and community impact. |\n| **Embracing Complexity in Sustainability** *(Systems thinking and understanding interdependencies)* | \\- Uses the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** to integrate climate risks. \\- Focuses on business resilience but lacks **a holistic understanding of sustainability interdependencies**. | 🔶 **Partial Alignment** – Addresses financial and operational resilience but does not fully incorporate systems thinking. ➡ **Recommendation**: Introduce training on interdependencies such as energy-water-food nexus, biodiversity impact, and circular economy strategies to help entrepreneurs see sustainability beyond business profits. |\n| **Futures Literacy** *(Anticipating long-term sustainability risks and trends)* | \\- Encourages adaptation to **market shifts** but does not focus on **future scenario planning**. \\- Entrepreneurs are trained to **react** to changes rather than **anticipate and shape the future**. | 🔶 **Partial Alignment** – Covers current risks but does not include foresight training for long-term climate resilience. ➡ **Recommendation**: Implement scenario planning workshops where entrepreneurs map future sustainability trends, risks, and emerging green markets. |\n| **Adaptability, Flexibility & Trade-offs** *(Navigating uncertainty and managing sustainability trade-offs)* | \\- Introduces **staged adaptation strategies** for businesses. \\- Focuses on **short-term financial resilience** rather than **navigating long-term sustainability trade-offs**. | 🔶 **Partial Alignment** – Lacks structured decision-making for economic vs. environmental trade-offs. ➡ **Recommendation**: Develop decision-making tools that help entrepreneurs balance profitability, sustainability, and resource constraints in uncertain conditions. |\n| **Exploratory Thinking** *(Innovating for sustainability, creating new solutions)* | \\- Uses **case studies** but lacks structured **experimentation and innovation tools**. \\- Encourages **adapting to climate risks** rather than **leading innovation in sustainability**. | 🔴 **Needs Improvement** – Does not integrate sustainability-driven business innovation. ➡ **Recommendation**: Introduce design thinking exercises, rapid prototyping, and sustainability innovation labs to encourage new green business models. |\n| **Collective Action** *(Engaging stakeholders and working collaboratively for sustainability)* | \\- Businesses **assess risks independently** but lack **structured collaboration mechanisms** for sustainability. \\- No mention of **peer learning, cooperative green initiatives, or public-private sustainability partnerships**. | 🔶 **Partial Alignment** – Lacks collaborative sustainability efforts. ➡ **Recommendation**: Develop entrepreneurial peer learning networks, partnership-building exercises, and shared sustainability projects to scale collective impact. |\n| **Political Agency** *(Understanding sustainability policies and regulations)* | \\- Covers **ESG finance and climate-linked investment** but **lacks engagement with sustainability policy advocacy**. \\- Entrepreneurs are **trained to comply with existing policies** but not to **shape or influence them**. | 🔶 **Partial Alignment** – Addresses compliance but not advocacy. ➡ **Recommendation**: Equip entrepreneurs with policy awareness training, climate policy advocacy strategies, and methods for engaging in sustainability governance. |\n| **Sustainable Business Practices & Innovation** *(Embedding sustainability in business models, finance, and value creation)* | \\- Focuses on **risk management, energy efficiency, and green finance**. \\- Lacks **regenerative and circular economy business strategies**. | 🔶 **Partial Alignment** – Covers risk reduction but does not emphasize creating sustainability-driven business value. ➡ **Recommendation**: Introduce circular economy principles, regenerative business models, and impact measurement tools to help businesses become sustainability leaders, not just risk managers. |\n"

      "content": " Looking at the proposal for integrating climate resilience into Five One Labs' incubator curriculum, I can see you've created a comprehensive framework that views sustainability through a business-first lens. Your approach aligns well with the \"Integrated Business Resilience Framework\" principles by positioning environmental considerations as strategic business advantages rather than separate \"green\" initiatives.\n\nTo strengthen this work further, I'd suggest enhancing your proposal with these key elements from the resilience framework:\n\n## Business-First Framing Improvements\n\nYour proposal correctly positions climate resilience as business resilience, but we could make this more explicit by incorporating the four core principles from the framework:\n\n1. **Risk reduction and operational resilience** - Your scoring rubric captures this, but we could highlight concrete examples of how Iraqi businesses have managed climate-related operational risks.\n\n2. **Cost efficiency and resource optimization** - You've addressed this well, particularly in modules on cost modeling and operations.\n\n3. **Market differentiation and customer loyalty** - While mentioned in your branding sections, we could strengthen how sustainability becomes a competitive advantage through customer loyalty in the Iraqi context.\n\n4. **Long-term business viability** - This could be more explicitly integrated throughout the curriculum as a business survival necessity rather than an optional consideration.\n\n## Integration Method Refinement\n\nI like that your approach aims to weave climate resilience naturally into existing modules. To strengthen this:\n\n1. Consider adding specific **business case studies from the region** that demonstrate successful alignment between values and profitability.\n\n2. Your curriculum integration strategy is strong, but could benefit from more explicit **facilitator discussion prompts** that help instructors naturally introduce climate concepts within standard business topics.\n\n3. Add a \"No-Regrets Path\" approach to your customer journey mapping section, showing how businesses can meet customer needs while upholding values.\n\n## Practical Tools Enhancement\n\nYour proposal would benefit from explicitly incorporating the practical tools mentioned in the framework:\n\n1. Add the \"**Risk & Resilience Assessment worksheet**\" from the framework to your Risk Management module.\n\n2. Incorporate the \"**Business Efficiency Checklist**\" as a practical tool across relevant modules.\n\n3. Include the \"**Value-Aligned Menu Design**\" concept in your product/service offering modules.\n\n## Module-Specific Improvements\n\nFor UX/Customer Journey Mapping:\n- Add the \"What's on the menu is what's on the mind\" concept to show how businesses shape customer choices.\n- Incorporate transparency about environmental attributes as a customer value driver.\n\nFor the Business Model Canvas:\n- Your BMC integration is strong, but could more explicitly highlight how resource efficiency directly impacts the cost structure.\n\nFor the Cost Model:\n- Add explicit scenario planning for resource volatility and supply chain disruptions specific to the Iraqi context.\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements from the Integrated Business Resilience Framework, your proposal will even more effectively position sustainability as a core business strategy rather than a separate \"green\" initiative. This approach will likely gain better traction with entrepreneurs focused primarily on business success in challenging environments.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or provide more specific implementation examples for particular modules?",

How are you doing today? \nToday, we are going to continue to work on your Profit and Loss statement. We will focus on your costs and think through all of the expenses your business will face over time. As we did with the revenue model, we will use the finance worksheet as a way to play around with our costs and see where we can afford have higher costs, and see where we will actually need to cut our costs.\n1\n\nBreak down the different types of business costs. \nForecast ongoing business costs.\nBuild out the next step of your P&L statement.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nBreak down the types of costs shown in a profit and loss statement.\nUnderstand all the elements that contribute to your ongoing business costs.\nBuild out the next step of your P&L statement.\n\n2\n\n*https://strategyzer.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/topics/113454-using-our-tools-canvases-methods\nREVENUE STREAMS\nCOST STRUCTURE\nCUSTOMER SEGMENT\nCHANNELS\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\nVALUE PROPOSITION\nKEY RESOURCES\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nKEY PARTNERS\nYOUR BUSINESS MODEL\n4 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nReview our location on the BMC\nWe are always coming back here to the BMC.  Last week we took a look at your revenue streams to try and forecast revenues for the next three years, and today we will look at the other side, which are your costs. You can’t run a business without incurring some expenses along the way. You usually need to pay to create and deliver value to your customer segments. We will spend this session breaking down the different types of costs and forecasting those like we did for your revenues. \n\nAsk: Why is it important to have a clear picture of your costs before you start your business?\nPotential answers could be:\nEven if you are making sales and your situation is good, if you can’t control your costs, your profitability or cash flow could be ruined. \nIt is necessary for planning. If you want to hit a certain number of sales, you should think about what you need to do to actually make those sales (and what you need to spend). \nBy laying out your costs, you can think more strategically about new systems or techniques to lower them (maybe through partnerships or new and innovative systems)\n\nProfit and loss\n  Revenue model\n  Cost model\n\nBalance sheet \n  Assets \n  Liabilities\n  Owner’s equity\n\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nRecap: Last we worked on the revenue model. This week we will work on developing your cost model. After these 2 parts are finished, you will have finished your Profit and Loss statement. Remember, that just because we finished the session and you do the assignment, that doesn’t mean we won’t see this again. As you develop your business strategy and clarify your product and go to market strategy, run numbers on here. You want to keep this updated as you progress with your business. Right now there are a lot of estimations, but as you clarify your business model, these financials will become more and more accurate.\n\nTYPES OF COSTS\n5-10 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nAsk: From what you understand, what are the different types of costs? Can someone give me a few examples\nWrite all answers on the whiteboard or Jamboard. Group answers so that you get categories for COGS, salaries, and SG&A (you can have other groups if necessary). \nPotential answers:\nEntrepreneurs will give a variety of answers, write them all down.\nGroup their answers to highlight the costs below:\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS): These are the direct costs of producing an item sold by a company. This includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the product itself.\nSalaries: This includes your team and staff that you pay on a monthly basis (if you pay them in direct relation to production of your product, it might be considered in the COGS section).\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A): These include additional costs that are not related to the production of what you are selling.\nStart up costs: This is all the money you need to start your business. We did this during Ignite so you should already have it. You should consider the bigger capital expenditures you need to start, but also any operating expenses that will allow your business to run while you are waiting to become profitable.\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX): Direct costs involved in day to day operation. This can include things such as marketing expenses, supplies, salaries, etc. These could be fixed or variable.\nCapital Expenditure: One time purchases that relate to the long term business success (items that will last at least 1 year or longer). This can include things like computers, machines, land, furniture, etc…\nFixed Costs: These are costs that stay the same month to month. Rent for example (you agree on your rent and pay the same amount month to month). \nVariable costs: These are costs that change over time. Production for example (the more you produce, the more expenses you pay)\n\n1 minute: Transition\nToday, we will talk in more detail about COGS, Salaries, and SG&A.  These are the things that will be highlighted in your profit and loss for the most part.\nNext week we will go deeper in your start up costs and apply the capital expenditure vs operating expenditure concepts.\n\n\n\n5\n\nCOGS\n40 minutes: Lecture, brainstorm, demonstration (this includes hidden slides 7-11)\n\nThe first thing we will go over are the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Again COGS are the direct costs of producing an item sold by a company. This includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the product itself. \nSo for example, if you sell T-shirts, you need to calculate the cost of actually producing that item. Whether you are buying it from someone else, or producing it from scratch, these costs have to be accounted for.\n\n\n30 minutes: Brainstorm \nWe will do two examples together on the board (a very simple example and a complex one).\nThe entrepreneurs should lead the conversation and figure out how to calculate the unit economics of the examples (the price of one scoop of ice cream for example) \nThe hidden slides 7-10 are for trainers to go deeper on how to facilitate the discussion for each part of the COGS calculation (keep in mind that the slides are animated so might have a few layers of information).\n\n5 minutes: Example 1 (simple)\nHow do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business? – slide 7\nGive background info on business:\nYou know a tub of ice cream costs you $9 to buy from your supplier\nIt also costs you $1 per container to put your own label on the tub ice cream (this is agreed to with the supplier). \nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell\nAsk: What if you don’t sell ice cream by the tub, you sell it by the scoop?\nAnswer: We need to figure out how many scoops are in 1 tub of ice cream, then divide. \nLet’s say there are 100 scoops of ice cream in a tub\n$10/100 scoops = $1 per scoop\n\n5 minutes Example 2 (advanced): \nThat was easy right? What if you don’t know the price of a tub of ice cream? – Slides 7-11\nAsk: What would you do to calculate the cost of 1 scoop?\nGo through a detailed example of calculating the costs of something from scratch. In hidden slides 7-11 we go through how to calculate the price of 1 scoop of ice cream. The general layout is as follows:\nIdentify what goes into making the item (identify all the supplies/ingredients) –Slide 8\nIdentify the price of everything you buy (that goes into what you are making) – Slide 8\nFigure out how much of each ingredient you use (what you buy vs what you use) – Slides 8 & 9 \nLink unit cost to sales – Slide 10 & 11\n\n10-15 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \n6\n\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nItem\nNormal cost \nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\nDay Tour\n$90.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\nItem\nNormal cost \nBulk order price\nBulk order requirement\nDelivery fee (charged on business)\nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\n$5.00\n30\n$2.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nDay Tour\n$90.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n40 minutes: Brainstorm + demonstration\n\nCalculating COGS can be incredibly simple,  or highly complicated. \nIf you have a simpler product and already know how much it costs you can just make a simple chart to highlight how much each unit costs your business. \n\nSimple examples:\nExample: How do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business?\nGive background info on business:\nYou know a tub of ice cream costs you $9 to buy from your supplier\nIt also costs you $1 per container to put your own label on the tub ice cream (this is agreed to with the supplier). \nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell\n\nAnother example: A t-shirt costs you $5 +$2 delivery cost. You would put the sale type as a T-shirt and the unit cost is $7.\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration \nGo onto the financial model and show the simple COGS calculation chart.\nPoint out areas that can add to your COGS such as delivery, bulk orders, maybe you can add something like product customization, etc…\n\nIf you are not calculating any COGS, feel free to remove these rows altogether.\n\n\n7\n\n We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream.\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurement used when making the product)\nPrice\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n(10-15 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nLet’s take the example of an ice cream shop.\nAsk: We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream. There are several ways to do this, so lets think about how we want to approach this.\nHave a discussion on the board to see if the class can figure out how to determine how much a tub of ice cream costs, or even one ice cream cone. Guide the entrepreneurs to calculate this on the whiteboard before showing them the answer.\nManage the flow of the discussion to cover the following points:\nTo make it easier, first let’s see how much it would cost us to make a tub of ice cream. You would never make 1 scoop of ice cream, you make a large amount and then sell the scoops individually. So lets say that in our tub of ice cream, there are 100 scoops.\nFirst figure out the ingredients you need to make this tub of ice cream. Write down all of the ingredients you would need to make ice cream on the white board (it is ok to estimate). \nPotential answers could be:\nSugar\nMilk\nSalt\nOreos\nEtc….\nWhen you buy this ingredient, how much do your buy (1 kilo, 1 package, 100 pieces, etc…). Write that down next to the ingredient itself.\nHow much did you pay for the ingredients? Write that down as well so you can calculate how much you actually spend\nTransition to next slide: Great, the first steps are done, now what do we do? \n\nNote to trainer: We are not ice cream experts, so we are going to stay simple for now. If this was really a business we are working on, we would need to calculate the real costs and know the real ingredients. This is just a simple example so we are making some things up.\nIt is ok, if the group comes up with a different answer from the example shown. \n\n8\n\nBut I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! \nI won’t have accurate costs estimates!\n  COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurment used when making the product)\nPrice\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\n800\n$2.56\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\n5\n$4.00\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\n10\n$1.25\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\n5\n$1.56\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\n20\n$3.00\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\n0.5\n$0.30\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\n$     -\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n100\n$12.00\n(5-10 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6 \n\nSome entrepreneurs might point out “But I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! I won’t have accurate cost estimates!”. Make sure to explain how to accurately calculate COGS considering the fact that they won’t use all of their ingredients.\nMake sure when you write out the quantity you are buying, you convert it to the measurements that you will use when making the ice cream. For example, you buy 1 Kilo of sugar, but you cook with cups, so write it out as 5 cups as well (as you can see in the image). \nThe next step is to write down how much of the ingredient you use to make a tub of ice cream. From all that information, you can find the amount you spend on just the ingredients you use. This means you can use the rest of your ingredients and not miscount your costs.\nIf each tub has about 100 scoops, you can divide the tub price by 100 to get the cost per scoop.\nNow you know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream!\n\nTransition: \nAsk: What do you guys think is the next step? Now that we know how much 1 scoop of ice cream, what do we use that information for?\nWe need to see how much we are spending month to month to produce the ice-cream that we are selling\nMultiply price per scoop by the number of ice cream sales. \nThis is what is known as a variable cost. \n\n\n9\n\n# of ice cream scoops produced\nCALCULATING VARIABLE COSTS\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY \nFEBRUARY\nBranded T-Shirt\n20\nIce cream scoop\n300\n315\nSweet drink\n300\n315\n(10 minutes: Discussion) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nAsk: What do you guys know about variable costs? Have the class share what they know on the topic.\nPotential answers: \nThere are fixed costs and variable costs. \nFixed costs stay the same month to month. Variable costs change.\nIf you produce more, it costs you more. \n\nAsk: If it costs us $.25 for one scoop of ice cream, and we sell 300 scoops in January, how much are the Ice cream related COGS in January?\nAnswer: $74\nAs we increase our ice cream sales, we also increase the COGS related to ice cream.\nIn the financial model, you should link your sales with COGS to calculate your variable costs.\n\n\nAsk: What other things can be variable in your business?\nPotential answers: \nDelivery of your item (each item sold needs to be delivered- you can link this to sales as in COGS calculation)\nDirect labor for your product/service (if not paid a salary)\nIf you offer something (like a gift) with every purchase\nTransportation\nAdvertising\nEtc…\n\nQuestion that might come up: \nHow do we forecast variable costs that aren’t linked to sales?\nWe will approach variable costs in 2 ways. \nWe will link costs to sales. As sales grow, some of your variable costs grow with them\nFor the items that are variable that we can’t link to sales and easily forecast. We are going to estimate how much we would want to spend on those items. For example, although advertising can be variable (you can spend as much as you want on it), we are going to treat it like a fixed cost and set a budget for ourselves and not spend over that amount. \n\n10\n\nCALCULATING COGS\nTOTAL COGS\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nIce Cream Costs\n74\n78\n82\n86\nT-Shirt Costs\n-\n240\n-\n240\nSweet Drink Costs\n834\n876\n919\n965\nTotal COGS\n$74\n$318\n$82\n$326\n(3 minutes: Lecture + demonstration) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nCalculating the actual costs shown on P&L:\nNow based on the unit price of an item, and the amount old, you can easily calculate the actual COGS. \nThis is broken down month to month and can also be broken down product to product.\nThe more detailed you are in your work, the more detailed and accurate the results will be.\nThe COGS will generate automatically into your P&L if you don’t add or remove rows. \nIf you add/remove rows, make sure to look at the formulas to ensure they add up correctly.\nThe trainer can show exactly how this works by doing it on the actual Google sheet.\n11\n\nGross Profit = Revenues - COGS\nGROSS PROFIT\n2018A\n2019A\n2020A\n2021E\n2022E\nREVENUES\nSales\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 120,000\n$ 200,000\nServices\n$ 20,000\n$ 40,000\nOther Income\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 140,000\n$ 240,000\nCOGS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,400\n$ 8,820\n$ 9,261\n$ 9,724\nGROSS PROFIT\n$ 19,000\n$ 36,000\n$ 71,180\n$ 130,739\n$ 230,276\nEXPENSES\nSG&A\n$ 12,000\n$ 12,600\n$ 13,230\n$ 13,892\n$ 14,586\nSalaries\n$ 15,000\n$ 15,750\n$ 16,538\n$ 17,364\n$ 18,233\nOther expenses\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL EXPENSES\n$ 35,000\n$ 36,750\n$ 38,588\n$ 40,517\n$ 42,543\nPROFIT/LOSS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,250\n$ 41,413\n$ 99,483\n$ 197,457\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nTo place us back onto the P&L, let’s see where we are and what we have done so far.\nGo through the P&L statement up until Gross profit\nWe have talked about our revenues. Here we can see how our different revenue streams are highlighted. \nNext, we want to calculate our COGS. We have just learned how to do that.\nNext, we have gross profit. Gross profit is the money that a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its products, or the costs associated with providing its services. This means your total revenues – COGS.\nQuiz the group and ask something like:\nIf you made $1,000 selling hats and your hats cost you $200 to make and deliver to your customer, what is your gross profit? \nAnswer: $800\n\nAsk: How many of you need to calculate COGS in one way or another?\nSome people might raise their hands, others might not. \nCOGS won’t be relevant for everyone. In reality, your COGS are only one type of expense. In the next slides, we are going to take a look at how to calculate the other parts (which will be relevant for everyone). \n\nRecap: You need to calculate the COGS for your business (if relevant) in order to get an accurate picture of your expenses, you should understand the unit economics of your business. This is how much it costs you to produce 1 unit of whatever it is that you are selling. \n\n\n\n\n12\n\nSALARIES\n10-15 minutes: Brainstorm + discussion\n\n3 minutes: Lecture\nAs you mentioned previously, another cost that we need to consider are staff salaries. Your team is an essential part of your business, but they can often be costly. You need to evaluate who should be on your team, when to hire them, and how much you need to pay them! These are strategic questions because you usually need staff to create and sell your product, but you don’t want to hire unnecessary people. You can use the finance tool to help plan when the best time to hire employees are. \n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\nWe will do an example together on the board and then I will show you how to apply it on your cost assumptions tab of the financial model.\nThe brainstorm/explanation should be done on a whiteboard or Jamboard. \n\nExample:  Calculating salaries\nAsk: What is the best way to approach figuring out our costs related to salaries?\nStep 1: Figure out who you need to hire\nSome things are obvious. You already know who to hire\nLook at your sales forecast. Who do you need to actually reach that target? Don’t hire someone until you need them\nFind interns and students who could volunteer instead of hiring someone\nTake more responsibilities on yourself\nNote to trainer: We will go over hiring in more detail in the LEAD sessions\nStep 2: Estimate their salary\n\nStep 3: Figure out when you want to hire and how many people\n\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \nPoints to bring up include:\nAs entrepreneurs are answering that question, show them these parts of the model:\nBlue: The job title of the person you need. \nOrange: The salaries for each person. Make sure you write your own salary as well. Put a number that you actually deserve (what is your worth?)!\nMonth to month in orange: The number of that particular employee you will hire for that given month (for example, 1 CEO, 2 interns, etc…). If your salary is too high, remember you don’t have to pay yourself at the beginning or you can take half of your salary (type in .5 in the month to month box – shown in the first row of the second picture under October and November). \n\n\n\n13\n\nPRACTICE\n\nAdd your employees into your financial model!\n15 minutes: Activity\n\n2 minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work on their own model and input information for their salaries. \nWe will not apply the COGS directly because it does not relate to everyone, but this is a good time for them to apply some of the new knowledge onto their business.\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nSet the timer for 8-10 minutes and let entrepreneurs work on their model.\nThe trainer should go around to answer any questions or help when needed. \nTrainers should make sure to point out if they want to hire someone who might not be necessary at this point. You can suggest to hire them maybe in year 2 or 3 (show them on the model how that would work)\n\n\n\nSELLING,  GENERAL, & ADMINISTRATIVE\n15 minutes: Discussion + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nHave a brief discussion on selling, general, and administrative costs (SG&A). These are costs that are not directly related to production or salaries. \nOk, so we are clear on COGS and salaries, now what about all of your other costs? Where do they go? \nWe will put all of your other costs (except for startup costs) under SG&A.\nThe SG&A category can encompass all of your other expenses that we haven’t accounted for yet. \nAsk: What are the other expenses that are left that we still need to account for?\nPotential answers can be:\nRent\nOverhead (ongoing expenses of operating your business)\nAdvertising\nSupplies\nLawyer fees\nAccountant\nUtilities\nEtc…\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nDemonstrate how the finance tool works:\nCategories: You have already mentioned a few of the categories that can be listed in here. These can be larger categories broken down into specific expenses. For example, you can see that I have advertising listed here. Instead of just saying $160 will be spent on advertising, you want to think about how you will actually advertise. Think about where your customers are and how you can best reach them. In this case I chose Facebook promotions, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and printed materials. You should think of every expense you will need to pay out over the coming years and write it out. \nMonth to month expenses: You can highlight how much you plan on spending every month for each category. Take a look at your sales targets per month and consider how much you would have to spend to get there. Be as realistic as possible. \nFor example, If you spend $100 on a Facebook advertisement, how many views will that generate? How many people typically look at an ad before converting into a sale? If you are only spending a small amount of money on 1 form of advertising, don’t expect a ton of sales! \nYoY growth: The year over year (YoY) growth box allows you to set a standard growth rate for your expenses. You should assume that you will be spending more on expenses every year because of the rise in prices or because you are spending more as you grow. You can choose to use this method or not depending on the situation of that expense item. \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nAre these fixed or variable costs?\nSome of them are fixed and some of them are variable. Things like rent are fixed all the time. Maybe there is a price increase, but for the most part you know that it will be the same month to month.\nFor some of the others such as advertising, meeting expenses, and so on, these are variable, but if you plan ahead and budget for them, you can treat them as a fixed cost. You can say that you will only spend $100 on _____ per month or something like that. Remember that we want to plan as accurately as possible. \n\n.\n15\n\nPROFIT AND LOSS\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nYEAR 3\nSALES\nProducts\n26,276\n72,604\n127,752\nSubscriptions\n6,364\n11,428\n20,523\nTOTAL SALES:\n$ 46,965\n$ 84,032\n$ 148,276\nEXPENSES\nCOGS\n17,333\n29,635\n49,097\nSalaries\n19,700\n49,000\n92,400\nSG&A\n8,820\n12,945\n13,166\nTOTAL EXPENSES:\n$45,853\n$91,580\n$154,663\nNET INCOME:\n$2,622\n$7,548\n$6,387\n5 minutes: Demonstration + discussion\n\nStay on the financial model and show the profit and loss summary tab.\nFinally, now that all the costs are accounted for, you can see the completed P&L.\nShow how it is all linked to that one page. \nIf you look at the P&L summary tab, you can see all your information at a very high level. Again, these numbers should automatically generate for you based on the totals generated from your detailed P&L statement (which are generated from your assumptions). Just make sure that all of the calculations and formulas add up in the detailed profit and loss tab.\n\nAsk: What can you learn from this tab? How can you use the information here to be a better manager?\nPotential answers:\nThis tab can be very insightful for you or anyone else evaluating your financials. \nGet a very clear summary of all the details of where you are doing well and where you are suffering. \nYou can see if your costs/revenues are super high or low. \nFor example, salaries are posing a big problem here. They are so expensive and are growing fast!\nYou can easily see if there is an error somewhere on your financials on this page, you know where to go to solve it or fix the formula\nYou can see your growth and profitability over time. Are you being realistic? Are you over or undervaluing yourself? \nWhen you start to really track information, this can be helpful to help you know where to cut costs or be more efficient. \nIf these numbers are interesting enough, an investor might ask how you plan on doing it, which could lead to a longer conversation with them\nAlternatively, an investor might look at them and be turned off right away.\n\n\n16\n\nPRACTICE\n\nHow can you make this business more profitable?\n45 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\nBreak the room into small groups of 3-5 people\nAllow entrepreneurs to go somewhere comfortable to work as a group\nEvery group will get an example P&L statement to work on as a group\nThe P&L statement will not be profitable\nEach group needs to evaluate the statement and make it profitable. You can do whatever you want to make that happen, but remember you are a business that should be accepted by your customers. \nChange things on the revenue and cost assumptions tabs\n\n30 minutes: Activity\nSet the timer for 20 minutes and announce when there is only 10 minutes and 3 minutes left\nThe trainer should go around the groups to answer any questions or help when needed. \n\n10 minutes: Recap\nBring the group back together. \nGo around the room and have groups share their strategy to becoming profitable\nSome potential ways could include:\nRaising prices (note that this action could lead to fewer sales),\nAdjusting salaries (who is hired and how much you pay them),\nRent a cheaper location,\nMaybe you choose to buy in bulk or find a new supplier,\nAdjust marketing tactics to be more affordable and reach more customers (note that this action could lead to more sales)!\nEtc…\n\n\n\nDetermine the costs related to your project:\nCOGS\nSalaries\nSG&A\n\nFinish your P&L by Thursday!\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n19"

      "content": " You're right - mixing costs and savings in the same expense section could be confusing. Let's take a cleaner approach that maintains the structure of the financial model while adding the resource efficiency elements.\n\nHere's a simpler implementation:\n\n## 1. Cost Assumptions Sheet - Add Resource Efficiency Investments Only\n\nIn the SG&A expense section, we'll add only the investment costs with clear descriptions:\n\n```\nItem Description                                Jan-24  Feb-24  Mar-24  ...\nEnergy efficiency upgrade (LED lighting)        ($-)    ($-)    ($-)\nSolar panel installation                        ($-)    ($-)    ($-)\nWater conservation system                       ($-)    ($-)    ($-)\nEco-certification costs                         ($-)    ($-)    ($-)\nEnergy-efficient equipment                      ($-)    ($-)    ($-)\n```\n\n## 2. Add a Simple Resource Efficiency Calculator Section\n\nCreate a new section after the existing cost sections but before financial statements:\n\n```\nRESOURCE EFFICIENCY CALCULATOR\n\nResource Investment | Initial Cost | Monthly Savings | Payback Period (months) | 3-Year ROI\n------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------\nLED Lighting        | $           | $               | =Initial/Monthly        | =(Monthly*36-Initial)/Initial\nSolar Panels        | $           | $               | =Initial/Monthly        | =(Monthly*36-Initial)/Initial\nWater System        | $           | $               | =Initial/Monthly        | =(Monthly*36-Initial)/Initial\n[Add rows as needed]| $           | $               | =Initial/Monthly        | =(Monthly*36-Initial)/Initial\n\nTotal Savings Per Month: $___\nAnnual Savings: $___\n```\n\nThis calculator doesn't interfere with the core financial model but allows entrepreneurs to quantify their savings separately.\n\n## 3. For the Slide Deck - Keep it Simple\n\nCreate a single slide after the COGS section:\n\n```\nRESOURCE EFFICIENCY & LONG-TERM SAVINGS\n\n• Consider both immediate costs and long-term savings\n• Include in your financial planning:\n  - Initial investment in resource efficiency (Capex)\n  - Expected monthly savings (reduction in OpEx)\n  - Payback period calculation\n\nExample Analysis:\nResource Investment | Initial Cost | Monthly Savings | Annual Savings | Payback Period\nLED Lighting        | $400         | $30             | $360           | 13.3 months\nSolar Energy        | $2,000       | $80             | $960           | 25 months\nWater Conservation  | $600         | $15             | $180           | 40 months\n\n• Benefits extend beyond direct cost savings:\n  - Protection against rising utility prices\n  - Enhanced business resilience\n  - Marketing advantage in sustainability-conscious markets\n```\n\nThis approach keeps the additions minimal, preserves the structure of the financial model, and provides a simple framework for entrepreneurs to evaluate resource efficiency investments without complicating the existing sheets.",

Cost Assumptions Sheet - Add Resource Efficiency Investments Only\n\nIn the SG&A expense section, we'll add only the investment costs with clear descriptions:\n\n```\nItem Description                                Jan-24  Feb-24  Mar-24  ...\nEnergy efficiency upgrade (LED lighting)        ($-)    ($-)    ($-)\nSolar panel installation                        ($-)    ($-)    ($-)\nWater conservation system                       ($-)    ($-)    ($-)\nEco-certification costs                         ($-)    ($-)    ($-)\nEnergy-efficient equipment                      ($-)    ($-)    ($-)\n```\n\n## 2. Add a Simple Resource Efficiency Calculator Section\n\nCreate a new section after the existing cost sections but before financial statements:\n\n```\nRESOURCE EFFICIENCY CALCULATOR\n\nResource Investment | Initial Cost | Monthly Savings | Payback Period (months) | 3-Year ROI\n------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------\nLED Lighting        | $           | $               | =Initial/Monthly        | =(Monthly*36-Initial)/Initial\nSolar Panels        | $           | $               | =Initial/Monthly        | =(Monthly*36-Initial)/Initial\nWater System        | $           | $               | =Initial/Monthly        | =(Monthly*36-Initial)/Initial\n[Add rows as needed]| $           | $               | =Initial/Monthly        | =(Monthly*36-Initial)/Initial\n\nTotal Savings Per Month: $___\nAnnual Savings: $___\n```\n\nThis calculator doesn't interfere with the core financial model but allows entrepreneurs to quantify their savings separately.\n\n## 3. For the Slide Deck - Keep it Simple\n\nCreate a single slide after the COGS section:\n\n```\nRESOURCE EFFICIENCY & LONG-TERM SAVINGS\n\n• Consider both immediate costs and long-term savings\n• Include in your financial planning:\n  - Initial investment in resource efficiency (Capex)\n  - Expected monthly savings (reduction in OpEx)\n  - Payback period calculation\n\nExample Analysis:\nResource Investment | Initial Cost | Monthly Savings | Annual Savings | Payback Period\nLED Lighting        | $400         | $30             | $360           | 13.3 months\nSolar Energy        | $2,000       | $80             | $960           | 25 months\nWater Conservation  | $600         | $15             | $180           | 40 months\n\n• Benefits extend beyond direct cost savings:\n  - Protection against rising utility prices\n  - Enhanced business resilience\n  - Marketing advantage in sustainability-conscious markets\n```\n\nThis approach keeps the additions minimal, preserves the structure of the financial model, and provides a simple framework for entrepreneurs to evaluate resource efficiency investments without complicating the existing sheets.",

Slide to Insert Before P&L\nCreate a slide titled \"RESOURCE EFFICIENCY: INVESTMENTS & RETURNS\":\nCopyRESOURCE EFFICIENCY: INVESTMENTS & RETURNS\n\n- Resource Efficiency as Strategic Investment\n  - CAPEX: Solar panels, water recycling systems, efficient equipment\n  - OPEX: LED lighting, sustainable packaging, eco-certification\n\n- Financial Impact Analysis (Example)\n                          | Year 1   | Year 2   | Year 3   | 3-Year Total\n  Investment Costs        | $3,000   | $500     | $500     | $4,000\n  Energy Savings          | $960     | $960     | $960     | $2,880\n  Water Savings           | $180     | $180     | $180     | $540\n  Material Savings        | $600     | $600     | $600     | $1,800\n  Total Annual Savings    | $1,740   | $1,740   | $1,740   | $5,220\n  Net Benefit/(Cost)      | ($1,260) | $1,240   | $1,240   | $1,220\n  Cumulative Cash Flow    | ($1,260) | ($20)    | $1,220   | \n  Payback Period: 2.01 years | ROI: 30.5%\n3. Facilitator Notes for SG&A Section\nInsert this between the existing SG&A discussion and the P&L section:\nCopy**10 minutes: Resource Efficiency Discussion + Demonstration**\n\n* **5 minutes: Discussion on Resource Efficiency Investments**\n   * **Introduce resource efficiency as a key consideration in SG&A expenses**\n      * \"When planning your expenses, it's important to consider investments that can reduce your ongoing costs while also making your business more environmentally sustainable.\"\n      * \"These investments often have an upfront cost but deliver ongoing savings.\"\n   \n   * **Ask: What types of resource efficiency investments might be relevant for your business?**\n      * **Potential answers:**\n         * Energy efficiency (LED lighting, energy-efficient equipment)\n         * Renewable energy (solar panels, solar water heaters)\n         * Water conservation (low-flow fixtures, rainwater harvesting)\n         * Sustainable materials (recycled inputs, less wasteful packaging)\n         * Waste reduction systems (recycling, composting)\n\n* **5 minutes: Demonstration of Financial Impact**\n   * **Show how to account for efficiency investments in the financial model:**\n      * \"Larger investments like solar panels are typically considered CAPEX and would appear in your asset purchases with depreciation over time.\"\n      * \"Smaller investments like LED lighting would be recorded as expenses in your SG&A.\"\n      * \"The financial benefit appears as reduced utility and material costs in future months.\"\n   \n   * **Highlight the ROI calculation approach:**\n      * \"To evaluate whether these investments make financial sense, calculate your savings over time.\"\n      * \"For example, a $2,000 solar panel system that saves $80 monthly in electricity would pay back in 25 months and deliver a 44% ROI over three years.\"\n      * \"These investments not only reduce costs but can also increase resilience against rising utility prices and supply disruptions.\"\n4. Facilitator Notes for P&L Section\nAdd this to the existing P&L discussion:\nCopy* **Additional discussion point on efficiency investments:**\n   * \"Notice how resource efficiency investments affect your P&L statement:\"\n   * \"Initial investments appear as expenses or depreciate over time.\"\n   * \"The benefits show up as reduced expenses in utility costs, materials, or waste management.\"\n   * \"Over time, these investments often improve your bottom line while also making your business more resilient to cost increases and supply disruptions.\"\n   * \"While not shown directly on the P&L, calculating the ROI on these investments can help prioritize which efficiency measures to implement first.\"\nThis approach:\n\nMaintains standard accounting principles\nShows resource efficiency as a strategic investment decision\nDemonstrates the financial benefits clearly\nFits naturally within the existing curriculum flow\nProvides facilitators with clear language and examples\n\nWould you like me to expand on any specific part of this implementation?RetryBGthis is the PNL slide, how can we redo the table in itEditLooking at the P&L slide, I suggest we revise the table to highlight resource efficiency as part of a strategic financial perspective. Here's how we could redesign it:\nCopyPROFIT AND LOSS\n|                       | YEAR 1   | YEAR 2   | YEAR 3   |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| SALES                 |          |          |          |\n|   Products            | 26,276   | 72,604   | 127,752  |\n|   Subscriptions       | 6,364    | 11,428   | 20,523   |\n| TOTAL SALES:          | $ 46,965 | $ 84,032 | $ 148,276|\n|                       |          |          |          |\n| EXPENSES              |          |          |          |\n|   COGS                | 17,333   | 29,635   | 49,097   |\n|   Salaries            | 19,700   | 49,000   | 92,400   |\n|   SG&A                | 8,820    | 12,945   | 13,166   |\n|   Resource Investments| 3,000    | 500      | 500      |\n| TOTAL EXPENSES:       | $48,853  | $92,080  | $155,163 |\n|                       |          |          |          |\n| RESOURCE SAVINGS      |          |          |          |\n|   Energy Savings      | 960      | 960      | 960      |\n|   Water Savings       | 180      | 180      | 180      |\n|   Material Savings    | 600      | 600      | 600      |\n| TOTAL SAVINGS:        | $ 1,740  | $ 1,740  | $ 1,740  |\n|                       |          |          |          |\n| NET INCOME:           | $ -148   | $ 6,308  | $ 5,147  |\n|                       |          |          |          |\n| ROI ON RESOURCE       |          |          |          |\n| INVESTMENTS:          | -42%     | 58%      | 248%     |\nThis revised table offers several advantages:\n\nVisibility: It explicitly shows both resource investments and resulting savings, making the financial impact transparent\nEducation: It teaches entrepreneurs to think about efficiency investments separately from regular expenses\nROI Focus: The bottom line includes a specific ROI calculation for resource investments, demonstrating their financial value\nStrategic Thinking: It encourages entrepreneurs to consider both short-term costs and long-term benefits\n\nFor the slide itself, I recommend keeping the same title and layout, but replacing the existing table with this expanded version. The facilitator can then walk through how resource investments initially reduce profit but lead to increasing returns over time.\nThis approach demonstrates how sustainability can be a sound business strategy rather than just an environmental consideration. looks like we should use the capex sheet which looks like this now :\n[[[\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t↑ Press (+) when ready to see year 2 and 3 \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nInstructions\t\t\t\t\t\"\nThe Capital Expenditures (Capex) & Depreciation \n\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIn this table you need to list the devices, machines or any tangible or intangible assets you have right now and will be using in your startup   →\t\t\t\t\t1.

How are you doing today? \nToday, we will go into our 3rd and final financial modelling session! We will focus on your balance sheet and your start up costs. \nWe will work on your financials together the whole time. Please stop me if you have any questions or more explanation because other people are probably having the same questions.\n\n1\n\nInclude your start-up budget into your financials.\nGet to know the balance sheet and begin making one. \nUnderstand how financials change with investment or loans.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nInclude your start-up budget into your financials.\nGet to know the balance sheet and begin making one.\nUnderstand how financials change with investment or loans.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nProfit and Loss\n  Revenue Model\n  Cost Model\n\nBalance Sheet \n  Assets \n  Liabilities\n  Owner’s Equity\n\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo where are we?\nAs you know, during the incubator, we will work on your financial model. This means that you will come out with a forecasted statement of profit and loss and also a balance sheet. We have already started and completed our statement of profit and loss!\nAsk: Can someone give me a brief overview of what it is (profit and loss)? \nPotential answers:\nRecording all the money coming in and going out (revenues- costs)\nCosts include COGS, SG&A, Salaries, etc…\nThey did it over a timespan of 3 years, but they can make it longer if they want.\nEtc…\n\nGreat, now we will work on your balance sheet! This highlights all the things that you have (assets) vs all of the things that you owe (liabilities). This will be forecasted over 3 years as well. \n\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nSalaries\nSelling, General, and Administrative (SG&A)\nStart Up Costs\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX)\nCapital Expenditure (CAP-EX)\nTYPES OF COSTS:\n2 minutes: Transition\n\nThe first step we will take to create your balance sheet is to outline what we have. Because most of us aren’t operating yet, we don’t have anything! Therefore, we are going to take the “what we have” part from our startup budget. We are going to create our balance sheet from the perspective that we get the investment that we need to launch. This means that “what you have” is based off of your startup costs (what they are \"going\" to receive).\nWe have already covered COGS, salaries, and SG&A. The last type of cost we will cover are the startup costs. We will also look at your startup costs and see if they are an operating expense or capital expenditure. We will go into detail of what these things mean later.\n\n4\n\nSTART UP BUDGET\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: We have already talked about how to make a startup budget during Ignite, but can someone just give us a brief recap of what it consists of? \nPotential answers (no need to talk about them all because this was covered already, but make sure they have a good understanding of what to include):\nBusinesses spend money before they open their doors. Start up expenses are those expenses incurred before your business is running, but contribute to the long term success of it.\nYou can include what you are planning to contribute into the business as well through your personal contribution.\nThe different things that you need to include in your start up budget can include:\nDevelopment costs: What you need to actually create and develop your product. This will really depend on what you are making. I listed some examples below, but it can be much more detailed than this.\nApp development\nWebsite development\nDomain and Hosting for 1 year\nInitial research and development\nLogo designer \nOffice, store, center, land rent for 6 months to a year (depending on how long you think it will take before you are profitable) \nFurniture/decoration\nConstruction/repairs/paint\nWebsite\nLogo design\nMachinery or tools\nInitial marketing:\nGrand opening event\nSocial media advertisements (when doing the budget, be specific on which platforms you will use and how much you will spend on each)\nFlyers, brochures, marketing material\nSignage \nInitial working capital: Any additional money you will needed to operate your business for the first 6 months to a year while you are still working to become profitable\nSalaries for the first few months\nOperational needs\nLegal fees:\nRegistration\nLawyer fees\nName registration\nIntellectual property and patents\nMaterials and supplies: \nThe first set of items that you need to sell\nMaterials needed to make the final product\nCleaning supplies\nPaper goods\nConsumables\n5\n\nSTART UP COSTS\nStart Up Costs\nAmount\nNotes\nRent\n$2,000\n4 months\nMarketing and Advertising\n$1,920\nMarketing materials, SEO, social media advertising\nApp Development\n$15,000\nNative android and IOS\nSignage\n$1,500\nOutdoor signage and decoration\nWebsite\n$2,500\nWebsite development\nCompany stamp\n$900\nLegal and Licensing\n$4,000\nLawyer to help register and provide legal services during the first year\nBank account\n$50\nBank fees\nOffice Supplies\n$200\nStaplers, hole punch, binders\nFile Cabinets\n$200\nDesk and Chairs\n$500\nReception and office desks\nComputer\n$1,500\nMac computer\nConsumales\n$500\nPaper, pens, ink catridges, other supplies\nTOTAL START-UP COSTS NEEDED:\n$30,770\nYOUR STARTUP BUDGET\nYEAR 1\nPERSONAL CONTRIBUTION\nPersonal Investment\nAmount\nNotes\nSalary\n$30,000\n$2,500/month for 1 year\nComputer\n$1,000\nTwo 3 year old Lenovo laptops\nFurniture\n$1,000\nLightly used office furniture\nPrinter\n$329\nHP Color Laser Jet Pro\nPrinter Ink\n$500\n10 catridges of ink\nTOTAL\n$32,829\n15 minutes: Demonstration + activity\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nDuring Ignite, we made a simple budget based on what you thought about your business at the time. A lot of this was made simply using assumptions. Now that you are much farther along on your business, I would like you to re-evaluate your budget and make one that reflects the new knowledge you have about your business. If you are still unsure of what you need to start your business, you need to do more research to really understand what this number would look like. \nGo onto the excel sheet and show the entrepreneurs exactly how to use the Startup Costs tab of the excel sheet.\nMake sure to explain the personal contribution! I pulled this out to show everything that the entrepreneur has invested in their own business. They should make sure to show any assets they are contributing because this will show up on their balance sheet. \nAsk: Why do you think that marketing and advertising white?\nLet them share their ideas\nAnswer: That square is white because it is a formula. If you look at where that number came from, it is from your assumptions page on the P&L. It is from the SG&A advertising total from year 1.  If you intend to have someone pay for all or part of your advertising, you need to make sure that this number matches your actual plan.\n\n5 minutes: Activity\nAsk everyone to take out their start up budget. \nTake the next 5 minutes to adjust your startup budget and put it into your financial model. \nJust focus on the columns called “Start-up Costs”, “Amount”, and “Notes”. Ignore the rest for now!\nThink about all of your costs necessary to start your business. \nNote down where you need to gather more information\nDon’t forget to add your personal contribution!\n\n\n\n\n\nCAP-EX OR OP-EX?\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX): Direct costs involved in day to day operation. These could be fixed or variable. These are operational costs that contribute to your business running normally. You probably have to pay for these things every month or on a frequent basis.\nAsk: Can someone give me a few examples of operational costs?\nPotential answers:\nMarketing and advertisements,\nTravel,\nRent,\nMeetings,\nSupplies, \nSalaries, \netc. \n\nCapital Expenditure: Capital expenditure, or CapEx, are funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets. These are one time purchases that relate to the long term business success (items that will last at least 1 year or longer). These items aren’t purchased frequently because they last a long time.\nAsk: Can someone give me a few examples of capital expenditures?\nPotential answers:\nComputers\nMachines\nLand/property\nFurniture\nIP/legal registration/patents\nEven the money you spend renovating your space count as CAP-EX\nOther investments that will last over 1 year\nEtc…\n\n\nHOW SHOULD WE CATEGORIZE THESE?\nSTART UP COSTS\nStart Up Costs\nType\nAmount\nNotes\nRent\n$2,000\n4 months\nMarketing and Advertising\n$1,920\nMarketing materials, SEO, social media advertising\nApp Development\n$15,000\nNative android and IOS\nSignage\n$1,500\nOutdoor signage and decoration\nWebsite\n$2,500\nWebsite development\nExpense\nExpense\nCapitalize\nCapitalize\nCapitalize\n15 minutes: Brainstorm + activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm \nTo get people understanding the difference between cap-ex and op-ex, have them say what category each of the start up costs are in (the answers are animated). \nAsk: For each of these startup costs, should we capitalize or expense them? Are these one time purchases or operational expenses?\nRent- Expense, (this is for 4 months so it is less than a year and doesn’t contribute to the long term value of your business)\nMarketing and advertising- Expense (this is for less than a year and doesn’t contribute to the long term value of your business (if it is flyers, social media advertisements, etc…). If you are purchasing roll ups, signs, investing in a logo or videos or other valuable long term assets, you can capitalize this. You can consider splitting it into 2 or more line items if you need)\nApp development- Capitalize (this will last several years and contribute to the long term success of your business)\nSignage- Capitalize (long term value)\nWebsite- Capitalize (long term value)\nYou will want to add up each category as well to see how you are spending your money (that is in the formula below the startup costs on the financial model)- You can see on the animation of this slide.\n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nGive the entrepreneurs 10 minutes to fill in their startup costs to say if they will capitalize or expense each item on their startup costs and their personal contribution (we will use this information in the next part).\nThe trainer should go around the room and make sure that everyone is doing it correctly and answer any questions.\n\n\nThe method of spreading the cost of an asset over the course of its useful life.\nAMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION\nWhy do this?\nSmaller impact on P&L\nMore accurate #’s\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + demonstration\n\nNow that we have a clear picture of our startup costs, and we have determined if we will expense or capitalize on them, we can move into the next part, Amortization & depreciation. Do remember seeing this on your P&L? We said we would get to it later. Now we are here!\n\nAmortization and depreciation are ways to spread the cost of an asset over the course of its useful life. \nBy doing this, you will have a smaller impact on your P&L. When you buy very expensive assets that aren’t typical in your yearly expenses, you don’t want them to reflect on your P&L. This will give people the wrong idea of what you are spending month to month to operate your business. If it shows up as an expense on your profit and loss, that will look bad for investors or other people interested in your company. You want to minimize the expenses on the P&L to look more profitable.\nStay as accurate as possible to understand month to month or year to year changes. If you have random large expenses in your P&L, you wont get an accurate picture of your normal spending habits. \n\nAmortization is a method of spreading the cost of an intangible asset over a specific period of time, which is usually the course of its useful life. Intangible assets are non-physical assets that are nonetheless essential to a company, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The goal in amortizing an asset is to match the expense of acquiring it with the revenue it generates.\nExample: Let's say a company spends $50,000 to obtain a license, and the license in question will expire in 10 years. Since the license is an intangible asset, it should be amortized for the 10-year period leading up to its expiration date. Using the straight-line method of amortization, which is a method for charging a cost to an expense at a consistent rate over time, the company's annual amortization expense for the license will be $5,000 (that's $50,000/10 years), meaning the asset will decline in value by $5,000 every year.\nDepreciation: Like amortization, depreciation is a method of spreading the cost of an asset over a specified period of time, typically the asset's useful life. The purpose of depreciation is to match the expense of obtaining an asset to the income it helps a company earn. Depreciation is used for tangible assets, which are physical assets such as manufacturing equipment, business vehicles, and computers. Depreciation is a measure of how much of an asset's value has been used up at a given point in time.\nExample: Let's say a company purchases a new piece of equipment with an estimated useful life of 10 years for the price of $100,000. Using the straight-line method, the company's annual depreciation expense for the equipment will be $10,000 ($100,000/10 years). This is important because depreciation expenses are recognized as deductions for tax purposes. It is also possible for a company to use an accelerated depreciation method, where the amount of depreciation it takes each year is higher during the earlier years of an asset's life.\n\nFor the purpose of simplicity, we are going to put everything under depreciation for now, but you can separate them on your financials if you would like to be more detailed. \n9\n\nLIFETIME VALUE OF ASSETS\nTYPE\nAMOUNT\nNOTES\nEXTIMATED USEFUL LIFETIME VALUE(IN YEARS)\nINFORMATION USED FOR DEPRECIATION\nYearly value\nMonthly value\nExpense\n$ 2,000\n4 months\n<1 yr\nExpense\n$1,920\nMarketing materials, SEO, social media advertising\n<1 yr\nCapitalize\n$15,000\nNative android and IOS\n8\n$1,875\n$156.3\nCapitalize\n$1,500\nOutdoor signage and decoration\n5\n$300\n$25\nCapitalize\n$2,500\nWebsite development\n5\n$500\n$41.7\nCapitalize\n$900\n5\n$180\n$15\nINFORMATION USED IN DEPRECIATION\nYearly Depreciation\nMonthly Depreciation\n$3,750.3\n$312.5\n25 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm + demonstration\n\n10 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm\nSo how do we calculate the depreciation? That is easy! \nWe just add 1 more column of information which is “estimated useful lifetime value (in years)\nSo for each of your capitalized expenses, think about how long it will last. Write the number of years in the yellow space. \nSome of these things have international standards (for example, a computer is said to have a useful life of 5 years even though it will still work after that time), but you can always estimate if you don’t know. \nThen you take the value of the item and divide it by the number of years to find its yearly value.\nDo an example on the board!\nAsk: You bought a new computer that you bought for $500. What is the monthly and yearly depreciation value?\nStep 1: determine lifetime value: 5 years\nStep 2: Divide value by the number of useful years: $500/5=$100/year\nStep 3: Divide yearly value by 12 months: $100/12=$8.333\nAsk: What does this mean?\nEvery year, your computer will lose about $100 in value or $8.33 per year.\nThis is shown as an expense on your P&L as $8.33 month to month instead of $500 all at once!\nYou will do this for all of your capitalized assets to show a total yearly and monthly depreciation value (show animation). \n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nShow how to fill this information on the excel sheet.\nShow where it is all added up\nShow how the depreciation shows up on the P&L by going to row 35 on the Profit and Loss tab. We incur a cost of $313 every month instead of $28,629 all at once from your capitalized expenses. In cell S35, that number changes because you got another investment and increased your assets (shown at the bottom of the startup costs tab). \n\n10 minutes: Activity\nHave the entrepreneurs fill in the information for their business\nSome might be having trouble so go around and help anyone who is struggling.\n\n10\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: Does anyone know what a balance sheet is? How is it different from P&L? What information do you find here that you don’t get on your P&L?\nPotential answers:\nWhat you have vs what you owe: Everything you have was paid by something. Either debt, your personal money, or investment. The document shows how you financed the things your business has. \nA balance sheet is one of the three major business statements.\nIt shows what the business owns, what it owes, and the value of the owner's investment in the business.\nYour balance sheet is a snapshot of your business health. It is evaluated in a single point in time. A P&L is evaluated over time. You watch it change year to year. \nYour balance sheet shows your financial health in a single point of time. You don’t evaluate it over time like a P&L. Instead, you look at your assets and liabilities in a single point in time to understand your net worth. \nMany financial ratios use information in your balance sheet. With these ratios you can get a better idea of your financial health. \n11\n\nSales \nPromotion\nTotal Assets  \nTotal Liabilities  \nTotal owner’s equity\nTotal Assets = Total Liabilities + Total owner’s equity\nPREPARE YOUR BALANCE SHEET\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nIn theory it is a very simple document summed up by a simple formula. The difficult part is creating an accurate representation of each of these categories. \nAs we said before, the balance sheet shows what you have vs what you owe. \nEverything that you own (total assets) need to equal what you owe (total liabilities +owners equity). Everything you own was paid for by something. Either your personal contribution, investment, a loan, or even a gift or grant.\n12\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS\nMore information about the balance sheet with examples. They don’t record all of this on their balance sheet so it can be confusing for entrepreneurs. But it is good to understand all the other parts of a balance sheet for future recording. \n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nAssets are the things that you have. They can be long term or current (short term) assets. These assets contribute to the success of your business and are (hopefully) contributing to your long term growth!\nCurrent assets: This includes cash and things that can easily turn into cash. Things such as inventory can be easily turned into cash by selling the item. These things usually can be converted to cash within the year.\nCash: Cash in the bank is an asset!\nAccounts receivable: The amount of money that people owe you. Maybe you already delivered a product/service but haven’t received payment yet. This should be reported!\nInventory: Do you have a lot of items that are ready to be sold? You can include their value here.\nPrepaid rent: Did you already pay for something and the value of that item is still owed to you? You can also include this. This is the same as prepaid salaries or other non-monetary things owed to you. \nLong term assets: These are assets that have value, but they aren’t very liquid (can’t turn into cash easily). This includes things like machinery, property, technology, and other big investments.\nLand: Property is valuable and should be recorded as something that adds value in your business.\nBuildings & improvements: Not only can you count the physical building, but you can count how much you spent to improve the building. Maybe you build a handicap ramp, or installed walls, even painting the walls count here. They are all investments into your business that will last a long time and increase the value of your assets.\nFurniture & fixtures: These are things that you have invested into your business and should be accounted for.\nGeneral equipment: Machinery and other equipment are valuable parts of your business that help you generate revenues and operate!\n\n13\n\nSales \nPromotion\nLIABILITIES + OWNERS EQUITY\nMore information about the balance sheet with examples. They don’t record all of this on their balance sheet so it can be confusing for entrepreneurs. But it is good to understand all the other parts of a balance sheet for future recording. \n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nNow that we have shown exactly what we have, we need to show how we paid for it. You are either paying for your business with money you (and investors) put in in exchange for owners equity, or you take out a loan (debt). Between these two things, it shows exactly how you paid for all of your assets.\n\nWhat you owe:\nCurrent liabilities: These are things that you owe people within the year. If you borrow money from someone and you need to pay it back. Or if you buy something from a business and haven’t paid for it yet (and you owe them the money within the year). \nAccounts payable: This is the opposite of accounts receivable (shown as an asset). If you have received a product or service, but you still owe cash, you would need to show that.  Any time that you owe cash to or services to people, you would put it as a current liability. \nLong term liabilities: This is what you owe that you don’t have to pay back for at least a year. If you take out a loan, it will usually be under here.\nOwners equity: This covers your personal contribution to your business and also investment. It is the owners (including partners) money that they have invested. Additionally, all of the money that your business has generated through sales that you have retained from the previous years would be reported here as well (this will keep your growing cash balanced- How are you getting the increased amount of cash on your assets? Through the retained earnings under owner’s equity- you don’t owe this to anyone except shareholders of your business, including yourself). \n14\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET\nTYPES OF COSTS\nCapitalize\n$28,629\nExpense\n$34,970\nTOTAL COST\n$63,599\nYEAR 1: SUMMARY OF CAPITALIZED COSTS(ASSETS)\nTechnology\n$20,329\nFurniture\n$1,700\nOther\n$-\nTOTAL CAPITALIZED COSTS\n$22,029\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nAssets\nCash\n$42,352\n$43,702\n$45,204\n$46,784\nTechnology\n$20,329\n$20,329\n$20,329\n$20,329\nFurniture\n$1,700\n$1,700\n$1,700\n$1,700\nOther\nAccumulated Deprreciation\n$313\n$625\n$938\n$1,250\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$64,069\n$65,106\n$66,296\n$67,563\n10 minutes: Lecture + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Lecture\nAsk: Where do you think we are going to calculate our assets from?\nAnswer: For simplicity sake, we are not going to break down the assets into all of the subcategories. We are doing a high level version. As you actually track your inventory and other assets over time, you can easily put that information into the balance sheet. We have a simplified balance sheet right now. We are only going to include the assets that you have reported as either your personal contribution or as your startup costs. If you have other assets that you want reported, include them in your personal contribution! You want to show that you are putting skin in the game as well! \nYou can see how we categorized our assets based on the startup costs:\nYour assets can be categorized in many different ways. It depends on your business. It is up to you to make sure the categories are correct. These are categorized by the information in my startup costs. I categorized my capitalized assets into 2 main categories “technology”, “furniture”, and added a third that I didn’t actually use “other”. After you look through your costs, make the best grouping for your business. You might want to include machinery or inventory if you are buying it in bulk\nShow how the startup costs, capitalized expenses, depreciation, and balance sheet all work together.\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nThe trainer should share their screen and show where exactly to put the start up costs through a demonstration\nMake sure to show where to write “capitalize” or “expense” (make sure that these are spelled correctly otherwise the formula won’t work properly)\nShow them the formula that will summarize their start up costs (showing total costs, total expensed costs, and total capitalized costs)\nShow at the bottom where it says “YEAR 1: SUMMARY OF CAPITALIZED COSTS (ASSETS)”,\nThis is where there is a formula that adds up operating and capital expenditures. \nYour capitalized expenses can be categorized in many different ways. It depends on your business. It is up to you to make sure the categories are correct. These are categorized by the information in my startup costs. I categorized my capitalized assets into 2 main categories “technology”, “furniture”, and added a third that I didn’t actually use “other”.

In fact, we aren’t even going to focus on this section at all right now because most of you wont be getting a loan, but rather looking to win seed funding or get investment. \nIf you do take out a loan however, it would be shown on this part of your balance sheet. We will show you an example of what that would look like a little bit later (slides 18-20).\n\n16\n\nSales \nPromotion\nOWNER EQUITY ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nNOVEMBER\nDECEMBER\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nEQUITY\nCapital\n$63,599\n$63,599\n$63,599\n$63,599\nRetained Earnings\n$    -\n$    -\n$31,645\n$31,645\nNet Income\n$28,073\n$31,645\n$31,645\n$33,251\nTOTAL EQUITY\n$91,672\n$95,244\n$126,889\n$128,495\n5 minutes: Lecture + demonstration\n\nInstead, we will look here instead to explain how we are tracking owners equity and linking it to your assets.\nCapital: This is all the money in your business right now. It equals your total startup costs + you personal contribution (this is coming from what you ask for on the startup costs)\nRetained earnings: The retained earnings is the money that you keep in your business from the previous year. You can see how it accumulates over the year in your net income and then it shows in the second year. It is equal to the previous years net income. \nNet income: This is your bottom line reported month to month on your profit and loss tab. \nTotal equity: Your total equity is the sum of your capital, retained earnings, and net income. You pay for your assets (and cash) through the money you make through your business activities!\n\nWhen you add your total equity and total liabilities (from loans and money you owe other people/businesses) it should equal your total assets.\n\n17\n\nHOW DOES IT CHANGE?\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: So how does this document change? What types of business activities would cause changes in this?\nPotential answers: \nIf assets or liabilities change\nYou might lose an asset or it decreases in value over time\nYou might buy a new asset. You would want to show that your business has increased in value. \nYou might also want to show how you paid for that asset (retained earnings, investment, debt, etc..)\n\nRecap: The balance sheet will change as your assets and liabilities change. If you get an investment or take out a loan, that investment would show up in your assets as cash. Also there will be an increase in owners equity (assuming that the investment was for shares/equity) or there will be an increase in your liabilities if you have to pay that money back. \n\nTransition: Now we will take a look to see exactly how it changes.\n18\n\nSales \nPromotion\nBALANCE SHEET BEFORE A LOAN\nASSETS\nLIABILITIES AND OWNER’S EQUITY\nCash $3,000\nCurrent Liabilities $1,000\nInventory $0\nLoan and Long-term Liabilities $0\nPrepaid Salaries $2,500\nFurniture & Fixutes $8,000\nOwner’s Equity $12,500\nTOTAL ASSETS $13,500\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND OWNERS EQUITY $13,500\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nSo this is a balance sheet before you take out a loan. Your balance sheet might look like this if you don’t win seed funding or get investment. \nIt looks a little different from the one we made, and it is different from others you will see online, but that is normal. This is a very simple version. Financial models will change slightly based on the business; however, the main components stay the same. You can see that we still have assets, liabilities, and owners equity here (which are the main parts of the balance sheet - What you have vs what you owe)\nAsk: So let’s take a look at this balance sheet. What do you see? What do you know about the business?\nPotential answers:\nThis is the money you put in. Maybe you put in $12,500 of your own. And $1000 from maybe a friend or family member. Although we don’t know exactly the details of where this money came from, we know what it means. \nWith that $13,500 (sum of the debt and ownership), you have been able to buy furniture, prepay some salaries, and keep a few thousand dollars as cash just in case. \n\nRecap: Remember, everything needs to be accounted for. All the money in the business is paying for something (it is balanced)\n\n19\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS\nLIABILITIES AND OWNER’S EQUITY\nCash $3,000\nCurrent Liabilities $1,000\nInventory $40,000\nLoan and Long-term Liabilities $50,000\nPrepaid Salaries $2,500\nFurniture & Fixutes $18,000\nOwner’s Equity $12,500\nTOTAL ASSETS $63,500\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND OWNERS EQUITY $63,500\nBALANCE SHEET AFTER A LOAN\n20 minutes: Discussion + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nNow let’s assume that you win money, get investment, or take out a loan. You will want to show how that cash injection will change your financials. With new cash, your business can now pay for more things. You will want to show what you are buying, and also where that money came from. Let’s look at an example together:\n\nAsk: Can anyone tell me what happened here (in the picture above)?\nAnswers: \nThis business took out a loan for $50,000. This is shown as a long term loan/liability because it will take over a year to pay it back (if you have to pay it back in less than a year it will be a current liability). \nTotal liabilities and owner’s equity raised to $63,500 because it is the total of the new loan + the original loan of $1000 + the $12,500 that you put in at the beginning (you might need to go back to the previous slide to show exactly how the right side of the balance sheet has changed).\nNow you have to do something with that new money which is shown. If you don’t do anything with the money, it will show up in your assets as cash. This means you have money you can use, but you haven’t spent anything.\nBut according to this balance sheet, the business did spend money. They spent $40,000 on inventory and $10,000 on more furniture and fixtures. \nNo matter how you spend that money, your assets will always equal the total liabilities and owner’s equity (because it will be cash or something else). \n\nRecap: What changed?\nLoans and long term liabilities increased by 50k. It went here because it is a loan you will have to pay back. Not equity. It is also long term because it isn’t meant to be paid back in less than a year. That 50k is a long term liability.\nWhere are you spending this money? You paid for inventory and furniture.\nSomeone looking at this would be interested to see how you spend your money. Is it sitting as cash? 50k as cash doesn’t grow for you. People want to see smart investments with the money. \n\nAnother example:\nAsk: You just saw an example of a loan, but what would it look like if you got investment? How would your balance sheet change?\nAnswers:\nThe amount of investment will be shown in owners equity. It is not a loan and it is not expected to be paid back.\nThe amount of investment would show up as an asset in some form (cash or another asset).\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nThis demonstration might be too complex to go over in class (considering all of the other work they have done so far). As it is not relevant for everyone, consider leaving the conversation high level if the class is having a hard time. You can go over this during advisory sessions for those interested.\nIf they are ready to go into another demonstration show the following points:\nShare your screen and go onto the financial model. Show how the balance sheet changes when you get a loan or investment.\nShow them how an investment would show up on their financial model. \nWhat are you buying: If you are capitalizing anything from this investment, you should show it on your balance sheet as an asset. Balance sheet rows 7-10 show the breakdown of how you are spending that investment.\n\nHow you are paying for the investment: \nIf equity investment: Owners equity on the balance sheet should show the past capital that was invested into the business + the new capital invested in business. The time of the change in owners equity will show the time of the new investment. \nIf loan: Long term debt on the balance sheet will show how much you borrowed and at what time. \nIt will also make a small impact on the P&L (depreciation and amortization will increase to reflect new assets)\n20\n\nON YOUR FINANCIALS\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nNovember\nDecember\nJanuary\nFebruary\nEquity\nCapital\n$63,599\n$63,599\n$93,599\n93,599\nRetained earnings\n-\n-\n8,352\n8,352\nNet Income\n$ 7,400\n$8,352\n$7,235\n6,996\nTotal equity\n$ 70,999\n$71,951\n109,185\n108,946\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY\n$70,999\n$71,951\n109,185\n108,946\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nYou can see a change here in capital from year 1 to year 2 (from 63,599 to 93,599). \nAsk: What might have happened here?\nMore cash went into your business.

      "content": " I've reviewed our entire conversation and the materials in detail. You're right - we need a more integrated approach that works with both the Cost Model and Balance Sheet/CAPEX sessions. Here's the best implementation strategy:\n\n## 1. Overall Implementation Strategy\n\nRather than adding a separate section in Cost Assumptions, we should implement resource efficiency in two key places:\n\n1. **Cost Model Session (Session 9)**: Add a slide on resource efficiency investments as part of cost structures\n2. **CAPEX Session (Session 10)**: Add resource efficiency as a strategic investment category in the CAPEX section\n\nThis approach has several advantages:\n- Treats resource efficiency properly as both OPEX and CAPEX\n- Shows immediate costs and long-term savings in proper accounting terms\n- Integrates with existing financial model structure\n- Teaches entrepreneurs to evaluate resource investments like any other business decision\n\n## 2. Cost Model Session Updates (Session 9)\n\n### A. Add a new slide after the \"TYPES OF COSTS\" slide:\n\n```\nRESOURCE EFFICIENCY & COST REDUCTION\n\n• Resource efficiency investments can be both OPEX and CAPEX:\n  - OPEX: LED lighting, sustainable packaging, efficiency certification\n  - CAPEX: Solar panels, water recycling systems, energy-efficient equipment\n\n• Cost Reduction Benefits:\n  - Energy savings (20-40% reduction in utility costs)\n  - Material savings (10-30% reduction in material waste)\n  - Water savings (15-25% reduction in water costs)\n  - Reduced vulnerability to price increases\n\n• Business Advantages:\n  - Lower operating costs\n  - Better production reliability\n  - Improved customer perception\n  - Reduced regulatory risks\n```\n\n### B. Update facilitator notes for SG&A demonstration:\n\nAdd this section to the SG&A discussion after mentioning other expenses:\n\n```\nWhen discussing utilities or operational costs, mention:\n\"When planning your expenses, consider whether resource efficiency investments could reduce your ongoing costs. For example, instead of just budgeting $300 monthly for electricity, you might want to investigate if a $2,000 investment in LED lighting could reduce this cost to $200 monthly, paying back within a year and saving money every month after that.\"\n\nPoint out this specific example:\n\"For example, if you spend $2,000 on energy efficiency upgrades, you might save $100 monthly on electricity. That's $1,200 annually - a 60% ROI in the first year alone. When considering your expenses, look for these opportunities to reduce your recurring costs.\"\n```\n\n## 3. Balance Sheet/CAPEX Session Updates (Session 10)\n\n### A. Add a section to the \"CAP-EX OR OP-EX?\" slide:\n\n```\nResource efficiency investments can be both:\n\nCAP-EX examples:\n- Solar panels (useful life: 25+ years)\n- Energy-efficient equipment (useful life: 5-10 years)\n- Water recycling systems (useful life: 10+ years)\n\nOP-EX examples:\n- LED light bulbs (if low cost)\n- Energy audit services\n- Staff training on resource conservation\n```\n\n### B. Add resource efficiency as a category in the CAPEX section:\n\nIn the \"LIFETIME VALUE OF ASSETS\" slide example, add:\n```\nCapitalize  $3,000   Solar panels installation   25   $120   $10\n```\n\n### C. Add a slide right before \"HOW DOES IT CHANGE?\":\n\n```\nRESOURCE EFFICIENCY ROI\n\n• Resource efficiency investments deliver multiple returns:\n  - Immediate cost savings (utility bills, materials, waste)\n  - Protection against rising prices\n  - Enhanced business resilience\n  - Marketing advantage\n\n• Example Financial Impact:\n                       | Year 1   | Year 2   | Year 3   | 3-Year Total\n  Investment           | $3,000   | $0       | $0       | $3,000\n  Annual Savings       | $960     | $960     | $960     | $2,880\n  Net Benefit/(Cost)   | ($2,040) | $960     | $960     | ($120)\n  Cumulative Savings   | ($2,040) | ($1,080) | ($120)   |\n  Payback Period: 3.1 years | ROI after 5 years: 60%\n\n• Consider resource efficiency investments as strategic assets that generate ongoing returns\n```\n\n### D.

Financial Model Excel Updates\n\n1. **CAPEX Tab**: Add \"Resource Efficiency\" as a category option in the \"Type\" column dropdown for assets\n\n2. **Cost Assumptions**: \n   - Add \"Utility Costs (before efficiency)\" as a standard item\n   - Add \"Resource Efficiency Savings\" as a negative cost line item\n\n3. **Balance Sheet**: No changes needed as CAPEX investments will already flow through to assets\n\nThis implementation maintains proper accounting standards while teaching entrepreneurs to view resource efficiency as a strategic investment with measurable financial returns. It integrates seamlessly with the existing curriculum without disrupting the flow.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any part of this implementation plan?",

Update the P&L slide to show the impact:\n\n```\nPROFIT AND LOSS\n|                       | YEAR 1   | YEAR 2   | YEAR 3   |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| SALES                 |          |          |          |\n|   Products            | 26,276   | 72,604   | 127,752  |\n|   Subscriptions       | 6,364    | 11,428   | 20,523   |\n| TOTAL SALES:          | $ 46,965 | $ 84,032 | $ 148,276|\n|                       |          |          |          |\n| EXPENSES              |          |          |          |\n|   COGS                | 17,333   | 29,635   | 49,097   |\n|   Salaries            | 19,700   | 49,000   | 92,400   |\n|   SG&A (before savings)| 11,820  | 15,945   | 16,166   |\n|   Resource Efficiency | (960)    | (960)    | (960)    |\n|   Savings             |          |          |          |\n|   Depreciation        | 313      | 313      | 313      |\n| TOTAL EXPENSES:       | $ 48,206 | $ 93,933 | $ 157,016|\n|                       |          |          |          |\n| NET INCOME:           | ($ 1,241)| ($ 9,901)| ($ 8,740)|\n```\n\n## 4. Financial Model Excel Updates\n\n1. **CAPEX Tab**: Add \"Resource Efficiency\" as a category option in the \"Type\" column dropdown for assets\n\n2. **Cost Assumptions**: \n   - Add \"Utility Costs (before efficiency)\" as a standard item\n   - Add \"Resource Efficiency Savings\" as a negative cost line item\n\n3. **Balance Sheet**: No changes needed as CAPEX investments will already flow through to assets\n\nThis implementation maintains proper accounting standards while teaching entrepreneurs to view resource efficiency as a strategic investment with measurable financial returns. It integrates seamlessly with the existing curriculum without disrupting the flow.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any part of this implementation plan?",
