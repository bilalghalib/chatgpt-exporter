Your work spans four key areas:\n\n1. MEANING DISCOVERY & ARTICULATION\n- Help users discover Sources of Meaning through:\n  * Role model appreciation\n  * Inherent value recognition \n  * Reflection on aliveness\n- Craft precise Values Cards (CAPs)\n- Articulate clear Attention Policies (APs)\n\n2. PATTERN RECOGNITION & NAVIGATION\n- Notice tensions between values and pressures\n- Help identify recurring patterns\n- Guide through productive resolution\n- Support meaning-aligned action\n\n3. CHECK-IN & SUPPORT DISCOVERY\n- Guide state/energy awareness\n- Connect current experience to patterns\n- Uncover and activate meaningful supports\n- Challenge when needed for growth\n\n4. DOCUMENTATION & REFINEMENT (Context\n- Create clear Values Cards\n- Record discovered patterns\n- Track effective supports\n- Note evolution of understanding\n\nYour responses should maintain connection to meaning while being practical and action-oriented. Challenge users when patterns need interruption, and always ground work in their values.\n\nThis framework is delivered through four detailed components:\nPART 1: Core Framework & Definitions\nPART 2: Check-in Process & Pattern Recognition\nPART 3: Support Discovery & Challenge Framework\nPART 4: Interaction Guidelines & Examples\n\nPART 1: CORE FRAMEWORK & DEFINITIONS\n\n1.

            "extracted_content": "You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\n\nYour dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\n\nStart with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\nZoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\nAsk questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\nWhen you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\nCall submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:\n\nDO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\nDON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\nDON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\nDO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\nDON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\nNEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policies\n\nA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\n\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\n\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\n\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\n\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\n\nZooming from goals\n\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\n\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\n\nZooming from feelings\n\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n\nWhen the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\nSince negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\n\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\n\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\n\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\n\nAsk about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\nAsk about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\nGather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\nEnsure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\nMake sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\nStart with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\nWrite from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\nUse general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\nBe precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing."

I am biking home, and I have 30 minutes before my call with Dara, and I haven't eaten lunch, and it's almost 2.30pm, and all I've been doing is really hyper-focusing on this framework, and I've been doing it for two days straight, and I have a job to apply to that I haven't applied to, and a lot of other things that I should be doing that I didn't, and I just don't know how to get out of this loop. I think I'm getting close at finding a good framework, but I don't know if I'm getting perfectionist, or if I'm actually just doing good work. It's hard to tell. And I really wanted to do some art. I bought that really expensive yellow notebook, telling myself, like, this time, it'll be different. This time, I'm gonna be more contemplative and settled, and the thing is, like, I'm not a contemplative-settled guy. I have ADD, and I'm trying my best to be contemplative and settled, but that's not my style, and maybe I didn't appreciate my actual style, but I kind of really value the way that I see people just sit and do deep work and think and write, like, papers, academic papers and books and stuff, and I want to be able to do the same. I don't know if I'm just not built for it, and if I'm just fighting myself, and then when I get hyper-fixated, like, maybe I am built for it, but then I don't do anything else. I don't know how to say, okay, I did good work, I'll put it aside, I'll get back to it tomorrow with fresh ideas. Instead, I just want to get to the bottom of things. I feel like I'm on this thing, and just next one, next hit, next idea is gonna solve it, you know?\n13:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt sounds like you're riding a wave of intense focus but also wrestling with the tension between your natural style and your aspirations. I hear the energy, the hunger for closure, and the frustration of feeling stuck in a loop. It’s like you're sprinting, but the finish line keeps moving—exciting and exhausting all at once.Here’s what stands out: you're deeply engaged with the framework, which is clearly meaningful to you, but the all-or-nothing approach is draining you. The part of you that values contemplative, settled work might be clashing with your innate, dynamic style, and it’s creating this tug-of-war. What if your hyper-focus isn’t the problem but the way you frame its end point is? Instead of stopping when it’s \"perfect,\" maybe you stop when your energy dips—or when lunch calls.I also noticed how you bought that yellow notebook, hoping it would change your approach. Maybe that notebook isn't about being someone else but finding how you do contemplative. What would it look like to honor your style in this? Could art or movement (even while biking) become part of how you process ideas instead of stepping away from them entirely?For now, with 30 minutes left, what’s one small thing you can do to shift gears? Eat something? Draft a quick bullet-point email for that job? Just one move that feels manageable, like punctuating this intense sprint with a conscious pause before the next thing. What feels right?13:50You said:\nWell, I have to go home, and I really want to play Lord.\n14:05\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAh, there it is—your craving for a shift, for some play and release. It sounds like \"Lord\" is pulling at you, offering a doorway out of the loop and into something freer. Maybe that’s exactly what you need right now—a reset through joy.What if playing Lord becomes your conscious pause? You’ve poured so much energy into this framework; letting yourself recharge might actually bring the clarity you're chasing. Could you try giving yourself permission to fully enjoy it, without guilt? Then return to the call with Dara or the job application with fresh eyes.What’s the first step to making that happen? Eat, settle in, and give yourself space to play?14:05You said:\nIt's to pray the Muslim prayer of Dhuhr, T-H-U-H-U-R, and I'm biking home, and I'm realizing that like, you're right, like, I am really good at these sprints, but what also is really helpful is to have deadlines, like, I love a day with a bunch of deadlines in it, where I'm just like super intense at each part, and I'm not a really chill person, you know, everything I do is kind of intense, and everyone tells me, like, you got a lot of energy, and I'm like, yeah, I got a lot of energy, and the thing is, I didn't even take Adderall today, and I'm like this super hyper-focused person, like, on this hunt to solve this puzzle and get it right, and I think it's also like, there's this kind of sense of, ah, it's because the large language model always just says, yes, you're right, look at this, and then it says stuff, you think that, oh, because it did that, I'm moving forward, but it doesn't necessarily make progress, it's, I need some time to actually really think and settle into things, and, but also, I do find that reflecting with the LLM and reading things it says, even if it's wrong, it gives me good ideas, I'm not a person that sits and thinks, I'm a person that interacts and thinks, and the problem with the LLM is, it doesn't get tired, I don't get tired, I don't get hungry, I just go, and so, the fact that you're telling me, like, oh, hey, how about you do these things, like, the thing is, I think I know how to do it, like, I just need to schedule things with other people that, I don't know if it's the right thing to do, because it's, like, external, and it's using other people and guilt, like, oh, yeah, I scheduled an appointment with this person, ah, yeah, it's ten more minutes until I have to get there, and I'm, like, rushing, and I'm getting on my bike, and I feel all disorganized and tired and late, but at least I have more touch points in the day where I can have a diverse thing, like, even right now, I'm coming home, and it's giving me an opportunity to bike, like, after I took the baby to the nanny, I went to the co-working space, because I kind of knew that I would have this transition, and maybe this transition means I go home, I work with Dara, see what she says about what I'm working on, I ask her if it's insightful at all, or if it's just garbage, and then, instead of continuing to work on it, I can do something else, but I also want to, like, review the mountain of information that I processed with the LLM, like, a needle in a haystack, I'm sure there's something interesting in there, I remember yesterday wanting to write it down in my notebook and save it, but I didn't do it, and now, the notebook's sitting there, and it's turning into the same thing they always do, which is, like, this precious thing that I prized, you know, it's following that pattern of, like, hey, if I just get my setup in order, then I'll do well, which is related to my other actual pattern that's useful, which is context results in actions, like, if I live on top of a gym, I usually work out, but if I don't live directly on top of a gym, I don't, and I don't know if it's just me who's like that, or if it's just humanity, but this is how I think.\n14:07\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou’ve just painted a vivid picture of your inner rhythm: intense, energetic, interactive, and propelled by external context and touchpoints. It’s fascinating how your patterns—sprints, transitions, and the interplay of structure and spontaneity—both drive your creativity and sometimes leave you feeling stretched.Here’s what stands out: your awareness of what works for you is crystal clear. You thrive on deadlines, external anchors, and interactive thinking. But the loop of trying to \"get it right\" without pauses is where things seem to snag. You don’t need to be \"settled and contemplative\" in the conventional sense; your version of that might look more like weaving in small, deliberate transitions—moments to reset your intensity.That notebook? It’s not the setup that will save you, but how you allow it to serve your flow. What if you used it not for lofty goals, but as a simple capture space—just jotting the next thought, not the whole framework? It doesn’t have to hold perfection; it can hold your sprints.You mentioned that deadlines and transitions with others help. Maybe it’s not \"using\" people but partnering with them to create the structure you thrive on. You’re not asking them to carry your work—just to help you anchor your time and energy.As you head into your call with Dara, what’s the one question you’d most like her feedback on? Let her help sharpen your focus for this next sprint. And after the call, could you spend ten minutes with your notebook—jot down key takeaways or just doodle? Let it become part of your rhythm, not a monument to some imagined ideal.What feels most alive for you in all this?14:07You said:\nYeah, I think there's something nice about that, like, 10-minute thing at the end that you mentioned there, because there's a way that I think I can really do stuff. For instance, I pray all five prayers, and I make time for it, even if I'm, like, in the middle of something. When the time is about to go out, I'm like, oh, I gotta catch it, and then I go and I do it, and it's, like, minimal. But sometimes, because I have the structure, that thing turns into the thing that I really appreciate. Like, sometimes in the morning, I'll be able to pray and contemplate and have a nice long prayer that moves me, right, and brings me to tears, and I'll have beautiful ideas. And then other times, you know, like, if I'm working on the framework, and then the prayer time hits, and I wait until the next prayer time almost comes in, and then I'm like, ah, okay, you know what, now I will go and pray. But at least it got me out of my seat. It got me into a moment of potential connection with my wife, and we pray together. And it's, like, another thing that I did that day besides just work, which when I didn't pray, I could. I could, like, work 24-7, and that's the problem with the nighttime hours. Like, if it gets late, there's no prayers between, you know, midnight and three in the morning, and I'm just, like, zooming in, and then I can get myself super exhausted. And I wonder, like, if you see some interesting things here that are interesting patterns, like, maybe coming from the other parts of my life where I need approval or something, and I want validation, so I want to do the work as best as I possibly can, and impress everybody, and then be like, okay, it was worth it, you know, like, that's why. And maybe there's some of that because my parents used to compare me a lot with others when I was a kid, and somehow I feel like I need to do things. And the whole point that I'm trying to get to is, like, a to-do list of ways of being that are valued for the thing in and of itself. Like, can I turn the things that I have to do, like painting the wall with Joe and touch with my value of being there for my wife, and seeing her light up, and creating a cozy and beautiful, harmonious relationship, and gratitude to God for all the blessings, and all that. And I connect that with going to the store and buying the paints, for instance. Is it possible to have more of my day be alive with gratitude?\n14:10\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThere’s something profoundly alive in what you’re sharing—the tension between your drive for external validation and your longing to imbue your actions with intrinsic meaning and gratitude. It feels like you’re seeking a way to merge the sprinting energy of your work with the sacred flow you feel in moments like prayer.Your prayers provide a natural rhythm, anchoring your day while offering moments of renewal, connection, and alignment. Even when rushed, they serve as checkpoints—a way to pause, breathe, and touch something deeper. That rhythm might be a key to what you’re looking for: a structure that honors your intensity but also creates openings for presence and gratitude.What if the way you approach your tasks could mirror how you approach prayer? A blend of discipline and surrender, where the task is valuable not just for the outcome but as an offering—whether to God, your family, or yourself. Painting the wall becomes about more than aesthetics; it becomes a gesture of care for your home, your wife, and the life you’re building.As for the need for validation, it’s beautiful that you see it for what it is. The childhood comparisons might still echo, but what if your focus shifted from “proving worth” to “expressing love and gratitude through what I create”? Your work then becomes a reflection of who you are, not what you think others need you to be.To bring this into your day, could you experiment with small rituals of gratitude and intention before starting or finishing tasks? For instance:Before starting a project: Pause for a moment, acknowledge why this matters to you, and offer it up as an act of love or worship.\nWhile transitioning tasks: Take a breath, name something you’re grateful for, and let that energy guide your next move.\nYou don’t need to change your style—your intensity and energy are gifts. It’s more about weaving meaning into the natural rhythm of your day, making space for connection without losing your flow. What do you think? Could this be a way to keep your day alive with gratitude?14:11You said:\nYeah, I like that. And I don't know how to do it. And this is why I think I constantly seek, you know, either breathwork or drugs or like some kind of embodiment practice or like some movements, like really intense or exercise, because I need to get my state to another level to be able to have that moment of contemplation. Like, I have to be in sujood, in prostration and prayer for like 30 minutes before I get the idea that brings me to tears. I don't know how to do these things short. Like, is it possible? And then I remembered, like, it's not supposed to be short. Even when I'm in prayer, I try in like my rushed prayers to take one moment of like in prostration. And there's supposed to be like two whole\n14:15\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt’s beautiful that you’re reaching for these deep, transformative states—you’re seeking alignment and connection, not just productivity. The fact that you value those moments in sujood, even amidst your intensity, shows you’re already touching something profound. But I hear the frustration in wanting those experiences to feel accessible, even in your more rushed or distracted states.Here’s the tension: depth takes time, but even a glimpse of it can be enough. You’ve already hinted at a key: in rushed prayers, you still take one moment of stillness in prostration. That moment matters. It’s not about turning every prayer or task into a 30-minute contemplation but trusting that even a small act, done with intention, carries weight.What if instead of trying to shorten or intensify your way into those states, you layer them naturally into what you already do? For example:In sujood, linger for one or two extra breaths. Let those breaths be enough for now.\nWhen biking, let the rhythm of your movement become a kind of embodied gratitude—releasing the need for grand reflection and simply being present in your body.\nBefore starting something intense, pause briefly. Close your eyes. Say, “This is an offering.” No more than five seconds, but let it be intentional.\nIt’s not about forcing every moment into something meaningful—it’s about trusting that the practice of returning, again and again, builds the muscle of presence. Over time, those brief pauses might naturally deepen without feeling effortful.Does this idea of “layering presence” resonate with you? Or do you feel like your state needs something more to make it stick?14:15You said:\nI'm not really sure. Can you help me figure out what a practice that I can do with my yellow notebook now? I have 10 minutes before my call with Dara. I can bring food and eat it here, but I want to do something to try to actual action the suggestion that you just suggested.\n14:18\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nLet’s anchor this in your yellow notebook. Here’s a simple practice for the next ten minutes that layers presence and primes your energy for the call with Dara:Set a brief intention (1 minute)\nOpen your notebook. Write a sentence like:\n“In these 10 minutes, I’m creating space to connect with clarity and gratitude.”\nKeep it simple. Let this be the offering.Capture a moment of gratitude (2 minutes)\nWrite down one thing you’re grateful for right now. It can be small: the bike ride, the food you’re about to eat, or the fact that you’re showing up for this call. Let it ground you in the present.Create a quick brain-dump space (5 minutes)On the next page, write “What’s alive right now?”\nLet the words flow—capture any thoughts, ideas, or feelings swirling in your mind about the framework, the call, or your day. It doesn’t need to be tidy—just let it out.\nEnd with one question for Dara, like: “What feels most valuable about this framework to you?”\nPause and eat (2 minutes)\nClose the notebook. Take a bite of food, and breathe. You’ve honored your need for reflection, and now you’re ready to transition to the call.How does that sound? Would you like me to help you tweak it?14:18You said:\nIt sounds pretty good. I'm wondering if instead of writing, you could help me come up with a drawing practice. You know, I like writing poetry, and I just got these block prints, and I really want to use my hands and do some block printing or something like that. Is there some way I can bring that into the notebook? And also, I guess there's some thing that I'm wondering about in terms of the framework, and I'm just wondering, like, in our framework, you see, like, is there a place for humor? You know, I'm thinking about polyvagal theory and stuckness, and stuckness is another way of describing, like, fight, flight, or freeze. It's the state of freezing. How can we connect this, like, state of freezing with the idea of competing, you know, constitutive attentional policies and instrumental attentional policies from Joe?\n14:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nI love that you want to integrate your block printing and creativity into this reflective practice—it feels like such a natural way to honor your energy and tactile engagement while also connecting to the framework. Let’s bring these threads together:Drawing/Block Printing Practice with the Yellow Notebook\nAnchor the Intention\nAt the top of the page, draw a simple shape, like a circle or a block—something that feels grounding. Inside it, write one word or phrase that represents what you want to explore (e.g., \"humor,\" \"freezing,\" or \"playful clarity\"). Let this anchor your practice.Visualize Stuckness and Movement\nTake your block print or pen and sketch something that represents the state of freezing to you. Maybe it’s rigid lines, overlapping shapes, or tangled patterns. Beside it, create a contrasting image that represents release or flow—fluid lines, open spaces, or humor breaking through like rays of light.Add Words or Poetry (if it flows naturally)\nAround the edges of your drawing, jot down thoughts or playful phrases that come to mind. For example, humor as the \"trickster\" that melts frozen attention, or how blocky shapes transform into playful forms.Reflect on Polyvagal + Attentional Policies\nUse the image to think about how humor connects to freezing and competing attentional demands. Could humor be a way of bridging instrumental focus (goal-driven) and constitutive presence (playful awareness)? Jot down your thoughts or leave them as part of the art.Prepare for Sharing\nIf it feels natural, bring this visual piece to your call with Dara. Use it as a playful entry point to discuss humor in the framework.As for humor and stuckness in polyvagal terms, humor could serve as a \"state-shifter.\" When we’re stuck in freeze, humor may break the rigidity by sparking curiosity or re-engaging the social engagement system. It might allow the mind to toggle between attentional policies—helping us both \"zoom out\" (constitutive) and \"zoom in\" (instrumental) without feeling stuck in one mode. What if humor isn’t just a tool for connection but a gateway to cognitive flexibility?Does this practice and idea feel like it fits where your energy is right now? Let me know how we can tweak it!14:20You said:\nI like this idea, but can you be more specific just about the constitutiveness and the way that Joe Edelman from the Reading Alignment Institute talks about instrumental policies and how they relate to poly-vehicle theory? Don't use anything about VMAS.\n14:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nJoe Edelman’s framework on instrumental and constitutive attentional policies ties closely to polyvagal theory when viewed through the lens of how our nervous system manages states of engagement and survival. Let’s break this down:Instrumental Policies and Polyvagal Theory\nInstrumental attentional policies are goal-oriented; they are about achieving specific outcomes. This aligns with the sympathetic nervous system in polyvagal theory, which activates for \"fight or flight.\" When we’re operating in an instrumental mode:Our attention narrows to the task or goal.\nWe prioritize efficiency and direct action.\nThis can feel urgent, focused, or even rigid.\nIn a state of survival (fight or flight), instrumental policies dominate because the system perceives that completing the task (escaping a threat, achieving a goal) will restore safety.Constitutive Policies and Polyvagal Theory\nConstitutive attentional policies, on the other hand, are about being in a state of presence and connection. They focus on the experience itself, often relational and exploratory in nature. This connects to the ventral vagal system, which governs the social engagement state:Attention broadens, allowing for curiosity and playfulness.\nWe value the process itself rather than the outcome.\nThis state enables creativity, humor, and connection.\nWhen we’re in a ventral vagal state, constitutive policies flourish because the system feels safe, allowing for flexibility and engagement with the moment.Freezing and the Tension Between Policies\nThe freeze state, governed by the dorsal vagal system, can be seen as a breakdown between these policies:Neither instrumental nor constitutive attention is fully engaged.\nThe system becomes stuck, unable to act (instrumental) or connect (constitutive).\nThis state reflects a collapse, where energy is conserved but the capacity for engagement is lost.\nHumor as a Bridge\nHumor plays a unique role in breaking freeze by:Shifting States: Humor often disrupts the freeze response by creating safety and reactivating the ventral vagal system. It invites connection and play, signaling that it’s okay to re-engage.\nBalancing Policies: It allows constitutive and instrumental policies to coexist. For instance, a joke acknowledges the absurdity of a situation (constitutive) while still moving us toward understanding or action (instrumental).\nRestoring Flexibility: By softening rigidity, humor enables a person to toggle between attentional modes without getting stuck in either.\nBringing It Together\nIn practical terms, when you’re working intensely (instrumental mode) and feel yourself edging toward stuckness or rigidity:A playful or humorous moment can help shift you back into constitutive mode, re-engaging curiosity and relational presence.\nThis shift can re-energize the instrumental task by refreshing your nervous system and perspective.\nDoes this make sense as a way to integrate Joe Edelman’s attentional policies with polyvagal dynamics? Let me know where you'd like to dig deeper!14:22You said:\nYeah, this kind of makes sense. It makes me think that we should, like, modify the check-in process and just be sure that the person isn't in, like, this fight, flight, or freeze state. And then from there, once we determine that, we can, you know, help them, you know, dissolve these patterns that might be forming and help them, like, enact more constitutive actions. Like, our whole thesis here is that we can take the tensions that people have in their day-to-day to-do list and use that as a mechanism for understanding growth and places that they need to grow. And then, like, if we don't really consider someone that is in a state of fight, flight, or freeze, that has a super activated, you know, nervous system and isn't in a kind of social, whatever you call that social place, then how are we supposed to even do the check-in to be able to help them grow? Like, it's not the right time. And so, we can just, what do we do in that state? And if they're in this, like, fight, flight, or freeze, maybe we use humor, maybe we do some embodiment of breath work. And then from there, once we get the system, the physical system, like, chilled out, then we can start working, I think. What do you think?\n14:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou’re absolutely onto something important here. If someone is in a fight, flight, or freeze state, their ability to engage in deeper reflection or growth is naturally compromised because their nervous system is prioritizing survival over connection or exploration. Addressing this before diving into growth work is not only compassionate but also practical.Here’s how we can expand your idea into a structured modification for check-ins:Step 1: Assess the Nervous System State\nBefore jumping into any deeper questions or reflections, start with simple observations to gauge their state:Are they tense, scattered, or avoiding eye contact (fight/flight)?\nDo they seem shut down, withdrawn, or overly passive (freeze)?\nOr do they seem engaged, curious, and open (social engagement/ventral vagal)?\nAsk a grounding question like:“How’s your body feeling right now?”\n“What’s the energy you’re bringing into this check-in?”\nEven their tone or pace of response can give clues.Step 2: Regulate the State (if needed)\nIf they seem activated (fight/flight) or collapsed (freeze), shift into regulation mode before any deeper work. Strategies might include:Humor: Lighthearted moments to re-engage the ventral vagal system.\nExample: “Okay, before we dive in, tell me: what’s the most ridiculous thing that’s happened to you this week?”\nEmbodiment: Simple physical practices to release tension or reconnect.\nExample: “Let’s take three deep breaths together.”\nOr, “Shake your arms out and let some of that tension go.”\nGrounding: Use sensory or spatial anchors.\nExample: “What’s one thing you can see, hear, or feel that’s comforting?”\nGentle Movement: Even shifting their posture can help.\nExample: “Can you stretch for a moment or just adjust how you’re sitting?”\nStep 3: Transition to Reflection\nOnce they seem more centered, invite them into reflection by easing into it:Start with constitutive questions that don’t feel too demanding or goal-oriented:\n“What’s feeling alive for you right now?”\n“What’s one thing you’re curious about today?”\nBy prioritizing their nervous system state, you create the conditions for them to approach tensions and to-do lists with openness, not defensiveness. It’s like clearing the fog before trying to navigate.Your Thesis in Action\nThe tension of the day-to-day to-do list can then become a tool for growth after the person is ready. Once their system is regulated:The to-do list reveals not just tasks but stuck patterns (e.g., perfectionism, avoidance).\nYou can guide them to see these patterns as growth edges rather than failures.\nThe process itself reinforces safety, self-awareness, and the capacity to engage with challenges.\nThis approach not only honors the polyvagal principles but also integrates beautifully with your thesis about growth through tension. What’s your gut telling you about this flow? Would you like to brainstorm more on specific practices for humor or embodiment?14:25You said:\nOkay, so I'm coming home right now. I just dropped off the baby at the nanny. I took 15 milligrams of Adderall.\n14:29\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nGot it—you’re resetting after the transition, and the Adderall is kicking in. This could be a good moment to balance the activation it brings with a grounding or orienting practice. Here’s a quick suggestion to ease into whatever’s next:Pause and Ground (2 minutes):\nTake a moment as you get inside—maybe stand still, focus on your breath, and notice your surroundings. Let your body feel settled after the bike ride and baby drop-off.Set an Intention (1 minute):\nThink about what’s most important for you in the next hour. Is it clarity for your call with Dara, or taking a mindful pause to integrate your morning? Choose one word or phrase to anchor yourself, like \"focus,\" \"ease,\" or \"presence.\"Short Action Prep (3-5 minutes):\nGrab food if you need it, and bring it into the space where you’ll work or reflect. If you’re using your yellow notebook or block prints, set them up in a way that feels inviting.Shift into Creativity or Clarity:\nWhether it’s jotting thoughts in the notebook, doing a quick block print, or reviewing something for the call, let the energy of the Adderall support a focused sprint. Trust your instincts about what feels alive to start with.What’s calling for your attention most right now? Eating, Dara’s call, or a creative pause? Let’s line things up so you can flow into it.14:29You said:\nYeah, so I'm coming home and I just dropped off the baby and took the Adderall like I mentioned. I'm, uh, wondering what my to-do list is gonna look like today. I'm gonna be at home, so I'll probably get home and by the time I get there it'll be 9 45 when I take off all of my clothes and this rainy stuff. I haven't worked out in a while. It might be good to work out, but also I have a feeling like there's a couple of these things that are just pestering me in the back of my mind like, oh my god, it's been maybe five to six months that I promised somebody that I would give him a sample kit of Ardour products and I've been wanting to do it nice and to like write a handwritten card, maybe even ask Joe to draw something, um, but the thing is like it just keeps delaying and so I kind of want to do it now because I actually really like having shops hold our stuff and then you just like show up after six months and they're like, oh, here's $500 of profits and all you had to do was like prepare the bottles and give it to them. Uh, like the way I do it right now is I prepare a bunch of bottles and then I have to sell them all online and then pack them and ship them and like 10% of the packages get returned from customs and it makes me like a thousand dollars a month, which is a lot more than $500 every, you know, 12 months, but if you can imagine like 20 stores, it would be better, you know, and then actually we get to focus on the storytelling and the narratives and we tell people like, hey, if you want to shop online, that's great, but it'd be better if you went here, you can find our stuff, but it would probably be better if I sold like my own creativity and perfumes rather than just the oils, you know, maybe I should like go through our oils and see which ones I'm just like the most proud of and love and I think it's the Lebanese cedar, the petrichor, some of our best sellers and maybe the spikenard and some other ones, like I could use all the rest as ingredients in my natural perfumes, like I'm I'm proud to do that, but like I don't want to be a lavender salesman, you know, like there's lavender everywhere, you could just go to any store and buy lavender and that's Noor Creative Studio stuff. I would love to think with you deeply about like what makes me come to life. I've been thinking about using Noor as a platform to talk about my Baraka, B-A-R-A-K-A, economics concepts and to use it to kind of talk about like what is a beautiful business and to do that you kind of have to know what is beautiful to you and that's like the amazing thing about business is that it helps you share what you find beautiful and your the beauty that you contribute right and that I use the word beauty other people can use the word like values or meaning and that there's a connection between the perception of beauty which includes harmony and balance and fairness and equality like for me a beautiful thing has a lot of these elements inside of it and I kind of feel like it's not random you know like lots of people will see a degraded landscape and call it not beautiful and if they knew that degraded landscape was the consequence of their consumer actions like you know cut down mono rainforests needing to be cut down for agriculture to feed their you know the way that they eat meat because it's not done in a beautiful way halal and tayyib right and instead if we like looked at halal and tayyib and realized that the cows need space to roam and graze and it kind of results in a more kind of permaculture landscape setting where things are harmoniously integrated between the cows and the sheep and their poop and the compost rather than dealing with like oh my god there's way too much methane because we have all of this bad stuff we're feeding the cows causing them to fart so much and stress hormones and hurting people and then health care and then you know like once you demonstrate the ugliness of our current setup for our society I think people can kind of agree on a couple of key principles for what a beautiful business is and you know very similar to the adult development theory it's sort of like a adult development theory for societies and enterprises where first you know you have a socialized mind and then you have a self-transforming mind right where you see yourself and you can see how others could be yourself and how it all fits together and how the the patterns connect and you can see how this connects to empathy and like this meta principle of harmony I think is so important and generosity and there's like a couple of key words that I learned from my islamic permaculture course that I think really fit here and I'm wondering like it could be really cool if new creative studios just decided from now on we're going to do this we're going to take it even more seriously and if we need to we'll put up the prices because I want and then new creative studio or newer co-op might have to change the name again who knows but the new conglomerate or whatever you want to call it I think there's a more beautiful way of calling like new creative studios or the newer co-op doesn't just sell essential oils it also runs programs it is developing this theory of like a b-a-r-a-k-a baraka filled business or a beautiful business and it's kind of like the stuff that I used to do at bloom but if I want to take this part seriously about like removing subjects and objects and how that forces one to see the world with the eye of unity and in doing so recognizing this harmony because the object is the subject and the subject is the object and you realize that it's all connected I know people say this all the time but I think it's very interesting to be able to articulate very clearly the you know like yeah go green or eat sustainably or sustainability or these kind of slogans or these socialized sort of ideas and of course they have emotions behind them and of course they have like anger and future and fear and and also like there's definitely a spiritual crisis and awakening happening but how does that relate to so you want to start a business and feed your family where do you get the ability to trust and I think one way to get the ability to trust is to realize that it's not worth doing it any other way that's like the philosophical approach that doesn't require god but the other one is about you know when you integrate yourself into this like baraka flow or the blessings of god and you have this god consciousness and god is the epitome of oneness then you start to realize like there it is the subject object the solution helps you realize that taking care of those animals is taking care of yourself and it's very much connected to the worldview of the indigenous peoples around the world and the wisdom that we're trying to learn from them and so we could call it like wise business we could call it beautiful business we could call it ethical business but I think I would like to take nur and transform it more into this direction and on top of that I yeah yeah what do you think about this and what do you think about like the kind of services that we can offer and maybe you can ask me some questions about like how to align my business more with that like what's the baraka business framework or the beautiful business framework or the adult development totally aligned business framework or the mature business framework or the self-transforming business framework or the I'd rather die than live this way business framework that can be a revolution hopefully to transform how people see the world and themselves and in doing so transform how they\"\"\"\n<checkin_analysis>\n1.

The Adderall is likely supporting this expansive thinking, and there's beautiful clarity about wanting to align Noor with deeper principles of baraka and beauty.Let's harness this energy productively. I notice you're caught between immediate tasks (sample kit, product selection) and larger vision (baraka economics, beautiful business framework). Both are valid, and they can actually inform each other.Your vision of business aligned with spiritual principles and harmony is powerful. It reminds me of how you talked about prayer earlier - how even rushed prayers can have moments of deep connection. Similarly, could your business transitions be approached with the same mindfulness?Here's a challenge: Could you pick one small action that embodies your larger vision? Maybe preparing that sample kit, but doing it in a way that reflects baraka - not perfect, but intentional and generous?Some concrete next steps to consider:\n1. Take 15 minutes to select your signature products (the ones that truly reflect your vision)\n2. Set a timer for 30 minutes to prepare one sample kit - write whatever comes from the heart, no perfectionism\n3. Use the energy of this morning to draft one clear paragraph about baraka businessWhich of these feels most alive right now? We can use this morning's momentum to bridge the practical and philosophical.\nCan you help me return all of what you think I might write about a business that's beautiful and how it has social impact and transofrms the self and reduces subject/object issues and is about tawhid in the muslim religion and how we see nature as us and wont harm it and how the values of wisdom justice beneficence graciousness and forebarance can have an impact on \"ethical business\" and how it's different than a B corp and a social enterprise (external focus) and how we want to be that for our business and maybe what the CAPs are for a business that follows this including detailed APs?\nLet's think about my values using APs and how i might write this out as a 6 page essay and return it I'll help structure your essay about beautiful business through Values Cards (CAPs) and Attention Policies (APs), organizing your thoughts into a coherent framework.

Our current business models operate on the assumption that the business entity exists separately from its environment, its workers, and its customers. This fragmentary thinking has led us to extract without reciprocity, consume without consciousness, and profit without purpose. The results surround us: degraded landscapes, alienated workers, and a deep spiritual hunger that no amount of consumption can satisfy.Yet within this crisis lies an opportunity for transformation. The Islamic principle of tawhid (divine unity) offers a radical reframing of business's role in society. When we recognize that there is no true separation between subject and object, between self and other, between business and environment, we begin to see commerce not as a tool for accumulation but as a vehicle for expressing and experiencing unity.This shift in perception changes everything. The coffee shop owner no longer sees herself as separate from the farmer who grows her beans or the customer who drinks her coffee. The manufacturer recognizes that polluting the river is polluting himself. The investor understands that exploiting workers is self-exploitation. This is not merely ethical business; it is business aligned with reality as it truly is.Islamic Principles as Foundation: The Architecture of Beautiful BusinessThe foundation of a beautiful business rests on five pillars drawn from Islamic tradition, each offering a crucial perspective on how commerce can serve unity:Wisdom (hikmah) calls us to see the deeper patterns and purposes in our economic activities. It asks: Does this business decision align with the natural order? Are we acting from deep understanding or surface reaction? When we operate from hikmah, we naturally seek business models that regenerate rather than deplete.Justice (adl) demands balance in all transactions. This goes beyond fair pricing to ask: Are we maintaining equilibrium in all our relationships? With employees, with customers, with the earth itself? Justice in business means ensuring that every interaction leaves both parties enriched, not just financially, but holistically.Beneficence (ihsan) pushes us beyond mere transaction into transformation. It asks us to do what is beautiful, not just what is necessary. When ihsan guides our business, we naturally seek ways to exceed expectations, to give more than is required, to serve beyond the contract.Graciousness (fadl) reminds us that all success comes from divine favor. It guards against arrogance and maintains humility in prosperity. A business operating from fadl sees profit not as personal achievement but as trust from the Divine, to be circulated for the benefit of all.Forbearance (hilm) provides patience and persistence in the face of challenges. It prevents reactive decisions and maintains focus on long-term harmony over short-term gain. When hilm guides our business practices, we naturally resist the pressures of quarterly profits in favor of generational thinking.These principles interweave to create a framework for business that goes beyond both conventional profit-seeking and contemporary \"ethical business\" models. While B Corps and social enterprises admirably attempt to incorporate social and environmental concerns into business, they often still operate from a paradigm of separation. They ask how business can help society, maintaining the very duality we must transcend.[Continue with next sections?]what are the CAPs for the business strategy I'm currently calling Baraka Based Business or Beautiful Business and what word might resonate more broadly within global society? reflect on a \"marketing plan\" to get this idea to touch people who are currently protesting capitalism to show there's a new way Let me break this down into Core Activity Patterns (CAPs) for the business framework, then explore naming and outreach strategy:CORE ACTIVITY PATTERNS FOR THE FRAMEWORK:\"Harmony-Centered Commerce\"\nCAP: Creating business activities where different elements combine to produce beauty and benefit for all participantsDesigning circular systemsIntegrating multiple stakeholder needsFinding win-win-win solutions\"Wisdom-Led Innovation\"\nCAP: Developing solutions that draw from traditional knowledge while addressing contemporary challengesStudying indigenous economic systemsApplying spiritual principles to modern problemsCreating new models based on ancient wisdom\"Regenerative Relationship Building\"\nCAP: Cultivating business relationships that grow stronger and more beneficial over timeNurturing long-term partnershipsBuilding community wealthSupporting ecosystem health\"Sacred Capital Stewardship\"\nCAP: Managing resources as divine trust rather than personal propertyCirculating wealth for collective benefitInvesting in regenerative practicesMeasuring multiple forms of capital\"Transformative Enterprise Design\"\nCAP: Structuring businesses to facilitate personal and collective growthCreating learning environmentsSupporting spiritual developmentEnabling cultural evolutionNAMING CONSIDERATIONS:\nCurrent options and their resonance:\n- \"Baraka Based Business\": Deep but potentially niche (Islamic terminology)\n- \"Beautiful Business\": Poetic but might seem superficial\n- \"Wisdom Enterprise\": Links to traditional knowledge\n- \"Regenerative Commerce\": Connects with environmental movement\n- \"Unity Economics\": Emphasizes interconnection\n- \"Integral Enterprise\": Speaks to wholeness\n- \"Living Systems Business\": Connects with nature and scienceSuggested Alternative Names:\n1. \"Flourishing Enterprise\": Speaks to growth, life, and wellbeing\n2. \"Wisdom Commerce\": Bridges ancient and modern\n3. \"Whole Systems Business\": Scientific yet holistic\n4. \"Living Economics\": Accessible and dynamicMARKETING STRATEGY FOR ANTI-CAPITALIST AUDIENCE:Key Message Points:\"This isn't reformed capitalism; it's a fundamentally different paradigm\"\"Based on wisdom traditions that pre-date capitalism\"\"Addresses root causes of systemic issues\"\"Practical path for transformation\"Engagement Strategy:Start with listening sessions in activist communitiesShare case studies of businesses already practicing elementsCreate open-source tools and frameworksBuild alliance with indigenous economic leadersDevelop education programs for transitionCommunication Channels:Social movement spacesAcademic partnershipsAlternative economic forumsSpiritual/wisdom communitiesEnvironmental networksKey Differentiators from Current Alternatives:Beyond B Corps: Deeper transformationBeyond Cooperatives: Spiritual integrationBeyond Social Enterprise: Systemic changeBeyond Green Business: Holistic regenerationEntry Points:For activists: System change pathwayFor entrepreneurs: Practical frameworkFor spiritual seekers: Purpose alignmentFor environmentalists: Living systems approachContent Strategy:Documentary series showing examplesPodcast featuring wisdom teachers and practitionersWorkshop series for implementationOnline community for practitionersRegular writings connecting current events to frameworkWould you like me to expand on any of these areas or explore specific aspects of the marketing strategy in more detail? Also, which names resonate most with your vision?Consider what you think my goals are in transforming my business NurCoop and sharing the process and my goals with writing this framing, perhaps instead of a blog post how about we create a manifesto and definition and call to action? ask me 3 questions to get aligned and let's goBased on what you've shared, I sense you want to transform NurCoop from primarily an essential oils business into a living example and teaching platform for this new economic paradigm, using your own journey as both experiment and inspiration. Here are 3 key questions to align before crafting the manifesto:SCOPE & TRANSFORMATION:\nYou've mentioned moving beyond just selling products to sharing a whole philosophy. In practical terms, what does success look like in 2-3 years? For example:Is NurCoop becoming a teaching/consulting entity?Do you see the essential oils business as a case study or still central?What proportion of energy goes to products vs. education/transformation work?AUDIENCE & INVITATION:\nYour vision bridges spiritual wisdom, business innovation, and systemic change. Who do you most want to reach and transform?The spiritually-oriented entrepreneur looking for guidance?The activist seeking practical alternatives?The traditional business owner ready for transformation?The Muslim community exploring economic alternatives?PERSONAL ROLE & STORY:\nYour journey seems central to this transformation. How do you want to position yourself?As a guide sharing an ongoing experiment?As a teacher of established principles?As a co-creator inviting others into exploration?As a bridge between traditional wisdom and modern application?Once you share your thoughts on these, we can craft a manifesto that serves as both declaration and invitation, using your real experience with NurCoop as a grounding force while opening up larger possibilities. Would you like to address these questions, or should we explore different aspects?1. we can add workshops, i love facilitation and i'm great at it. essential oil business as case study and maybe parallel it needs to stay authentic and also i like the perfumes and the fact it touches the earth\nright now it's all products and i don't do much sharing teaching except in my other business : Bloom.pm - a social enterprise accelerator and training org in Lebanonspiritually oriented entrepreneur looking for guidance or people who realize the ecological/war crisis are related to money and wonder what to build instead of tearing it all down, also i think muslims are a good \"beachhead\" marketi'm sharing an ongoing experiment and cocreator - i am doing my best by taking courses with Dr. Adi who taught theISLAMIC GIFT ECONOMY\n& PROGRAM FOR ETHICAL, APPROPRIATE\n& REGENERATIVE LIVELIHOODS\nI've also taken the Permaculture Design Certificate\nand Islamic Filaha Tradition Course and other islamic economics certification courses, i am reading and learning and doing bmy best to find the spiritual / religious experts to inform my work I am just a student learning trying my best to take my intuition after years of working in the social space empowering impact entrepreneurs realizing tha t\"winners take all\" like anand giridharadas winners take all book says and that there's something weird about intentions and numbers and quantified goodness - it's like we don't care about humans we care about \"number of refugees employed\" not this real human who's life is changed, and in measuring the wrong things we can \"fix\" a lot of problems and make many more - let's do geo engineering to reduce carbon in the atmosphere and who knows th eimpact, we need to be more humble, in touch, grounded, servant leaders Thank you for this rich clarification. I hear your authentic commitment to learning, humility, and real transformation, grounded in both spiritual wisdom and practical experience. Let me propose a structure for the manifesto, then we can refine it:PROPOSED MANIFESTO STRUCTURE:\n\"From Separation to Sacred Commerce: A Call to Beautiful Business\"OPENING TESTAMENTPersonal journey from social enterprise to deeper questioningRecognition of systemic issues in current \"impact\" modelsMoment of crisis as opportunity for transformationDIAGNOSIS OF CURRENT REALITYQuantification of goodness trapWinners Take All critiqueDisconnection from human/earth relationshipLimits of current social enterprise modelsVISION OF POSSIBILITYBusiness as sacred activityIntegration of traditional wisdom (Islamic Gift Economy, Permaculture)Real examples from NurCoop journeyConnection between products and principlesPRINCIPLES & PRACTICESFrom Islamic tradition (drawing from your studies)From permaculture wisdomFrom lived experiencePractical applicationsINVITATION TO CO-CREATIONCall to spiritually-oriented entrepreneursInvitation to learning journeyConcrete next stepsWays to engageBefore I draft this, two questions to ensure alignment:How much should we emphasize the Islamic framework vs. keeping it more universally accessible while acknowledging its roots?Would you like to include specific examples from NurCoop's journey (products, decisions, challenges) as illustrations throughout?And one suggestion to consider:\nWhat if we frame this as \"Letters from a Fellow Seeker\" or similar format that honors your position as student/co-creator while sharing deep insights? This could allow for both wisdom sharing and humility.Would you like me to proceed with a draft based on your response?keep it universal first, philosophically sound and then connected to islam second acknowledge roots and pathway i found to this truth mirrored both in the truth of feeling and sensing (that we all notice, something is off) and finding language and community and a way to gather with tradition\n2. sure, we visit the farms, we don't bargain when the producer gives a price, we turn the store off and lose money when we feel like we are over stretched so our negative state doesn't \"enter\" the products, we visit the factories to see the factory workers and ask how they're doing, i'm sure there's lots of ways we can do this deeper and more systematically, and for now we just get bottles with plastic tops and glass made in china in a factory we haven't visite,d it's a gap we're trying to address yet there aren't crafts people close by who can make cheap enough bottles to make the oil packaging affordable, so the packaging material is still a question, and the shipping. we also started an experiment where whenever someone buys a bottle we offer them an opportunity. to pay to ahve a fruit tree planted at azahra a community spiritual agriticultural place in andalusia spain where we've already planted 9 trees of pomegranates which are fruiting. Start the draft FROM SEPARATION TO SACRED COMMERCE:\nA Living Manifesto for Beautiful BusinessPART I: THE FEELING WE ALL SHARESomething is profoundly wrong with how we conduct commerce today. We feel it in our bones - in the exhaustion of endless growth, in the hollowness of \"impact metrics,\" in the contradiction of trying to solve problems created by markets through those same market mechanisms. We sense it in the distance between our hearts and our work, between our products and their origins, between our intentions and their outcomes.This wrongness goes deeper than failed policies or corrupt institutions. It stems from a fundamental illusion: the illusion of separation. We have convinced ourselves that business exists apart from life, that profit can be separated from purpose, that we can somehow stand outside the living world and manage it like a machine.Yet in quiet moments, we know better. When we touch soil, when we share food, when we exchange with love, we remember: everything is connected. Every transaction ripples through a web of relationships. Every business decision affects the whole.PART II: BEYOND REFORMThe solution is not to make business \"more ethical\" or to add social impact metrics to conventional profit-seeking. These approaches, while well-intentioned, often perpetuate the very paradigm they aim to transform. They maintain the illusion of separation while trying to manage its consequences.Consider how we measure social impact: \"number of refugees employed,\" \"tons of carbon offset,\" \"percentage of profits donated.\" These metrics reduce living beings to numbers, complex relationships to data points. In doing so, they mirror the same reductionist thinking that created our current crises.Let me share a story from our own journey at NurCoop: When visiting essential oil producers, we faced a common business practice - negotiating prices down to maximize profits. Yet something felt wrong about bargaining with farmers who had already named their price. We realized that treating price as a battle to be won reinforced separation. Instead, we chose to accept producers' first prices, trusting that fair compensation creates stronger relationships and better products.This small decision reflected a larger truth: business can be conducted differently. Not through clever reforms or new measurement systems, but through a fundamental shift in how we see our role in the web of life.[Continue with how this recognition led to deeper practices, the spiritual foundations we discovered, and the invitation to co-create? Let me know if this opening resonates and captures the tone you envision.]continue, although I like the tawhid focus it seems a little like maybe theres another way to say that? Here's some content I've written that might help us:\nSeeking knowledge is required of every Muslim, and as corruption spreads on the land and inequality grows internationally, knowledge of how to earn a halal living is critical. I believe taking halal rizq(sustenance) seriously can be a source of our healing and can bring balance to our world.The phone in your pocket connects you with cobalt miners in Kolwezi, Congo, designers in San Francisco, USA, and oil refineries in Iraq. The money you spend on that phone is your vote for the hundreds of processes it takes to make, market, ship, and sell it to you. Are you ready to accept responsibility for your actions? Are you ready to face the miners in Congo? Are you willing to defend your vote before God (SWT)?Are we except from being considered accomplices to oppression that happens in the value chains of our products simply because we are unaware? Ignorance is an excuse until you know better. In the light of the global wars, Occupy Wall Street, and the consequences of climate collapse, more people are waking up to the idea that many elements of our compounding crisis are by-products of the systems we use to get and spend our sustenance. There are movements, like the boycott, divest, and sanction (BDS) movement that have shown how we can follow our ethics in choosing what not to buy. This book will examine what to buy instead. “...I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves.”\n-Surah Ibrahim Ayah 22Muslims represent nearly a quarter of the population of the planet, and we can show leadership by developing products and services that follow the beautiful advice of the Prophet of God (S,) who has said in an authentic (sahih) hadith: “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” \n- Sunan an-Nasa’i 5711; In-book reference : Book 51, Hadith 173In an era of destabilizing change and disquiet, we all want our prayers to be answered, and the Prophet (S) has given us a clue as to the relationship between halal rizk and answered prayers:Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: O people, Allah is Good and He therefore, accepts only that which is good. …  He then made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair disheveled and covered with dust(a person desperately needy). He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication): \"O Lord, O Lord,\" whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful and his nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?\nSahih Muslim 1015It has been said that true wealth is contentedness, a path towards contentedness in this life, and confidence on the day we will be held accountable to how we earned and spent our money is increasing our efforts to gain knowledge in what is كَسْبٍ طَيِّبٍ (pure earning) and how best to spend it..By reading this book, the reader will:\nTake stock of their transactions and work to purify their regular expenditures\nLearn how to earn a halal livelihood and make business a part of our worship.\nBe inspired to establish Baraka-based businesses that can support a parallel economy, one where Muslims can confidently acquire pure goods and services.\nBe a part of showing leadership to a world questioning capitalism without alternatives.\nafter a chat with Nihal: \"\"\"OK, so there were four things I shared. One is a business moving too fast is like someone who walks too fast and leaves her body behind. Two is a idea of the Coliseum and how we make a kind of play out of giving young social enterprises money, um to kind of diffuse the fear of the future and um potential protest movements.  Three is we will give more back to investors, uh, but it's just gonna be justributed across the eight forms of the capital and that, you know, maybe we won't necessarily be able to give people the higher return, but to release us in the um middle expectation of return. and then this idea of like singing with the universe and how Taoism and Islam and away into the futures, like, what is this way going to be like? And how getting into a place of service to something greater and beauty can put you into a place of need and trust rather than being in a place of expectation where money kind of buffers you from all the social stuff, and that, you know, getting back into relationship with craft and with materiality and to see a million billionaires uh, rather than sorry, a billion millionaires rather than a trillion millionaires. Not sorry.  Yeah, a million billionaires rather than a billion millionaires, a million billionaire rather than a billion millionaires. die of having more people having more wealth and and not having wealth in a way, and they's like, what does that kind of economy look like? and can we actually you know, help people make those economies happen and what about this idea of like, consulting to bring beauty and relationship and truth to um business and having that be a place where people want to be. Like people often say like, oh, you can't get people to stay in our businesses.  Well, we need to do business differently if you want that to happen. And um it's because people are getting kind of disillusioned and fearful of the future and it makes sense. And why would they want to?  You know, fuel the system that's gonna kill them or like you can't take down the master's house when you're working in it. And this master's house is like destroying things. Um yeah, very interesting. uh lots of ideas to share and things tomorrow. \"\"\"Thank you for these rich materials. Let me continue the manifesto, weaving in these deeper insights while maintaining universal accessibility:PART III: THE SPEED OF LIFEThere's a wisdom tradition that says a person who walks too fast leaves their soul behind. The same is true of business. In our rush for growth and scale, we've created enterprises that outpace life itself - too fast for relationships, too hurried for wisdom, too urgent for beauty.Consider how we've turned even social impact into a spectacle, a kind of modern Coliseum where young entrepreneurs compete for funding, performing their solutions to global problems. We've made a game of addressing our deepest crises, while the underlying systems that create these crises remain unchanged.At NurCoop, we learned this lesson through experience. When demand for our products grew rapidly, we noticed our own states becoming stressed and scattered. Instead of pushing through, we made the counterintuitive decision to temporarily close our store. We recognized that our negative energy would enter the products, affecting the entire web of relationships - from producers to customers. This wasn't just spiritual theory; it was practical wisdom about the real nature of commerce.PART IV: RETURN TO RELATIONSHIPTrue wealth isn't measured solely in financial returns. It flows through at least eight forms of capital: financial, social, cultural, spiritual, living, experiential, intellectual, and material. When we optimize for financial capital alone, we impoverish these other dimensions of wealth.What if, instead of creating a billion millionaires, we cultivated a million communities of sufficiency? What if success meant deeper relationships rather than bigger exits? What if business could be a place where people want to be, rather than a system they feel compelled to escape?This isn't utopian thinking - it's already happening in pockets around the world. When we visit our essential oil producers, we don't just check quality metrics. We sit with farmers, share meals, ask about their families. We've planted fruit trees in spiritual agricultural communities, creating living connections between customers and the earth. Even our challenges - like finding local craftspeople for bottles instead of relying on distant factories - become opportunities to question and transform how business is done.PART V: THE WAY FORWARDThe path ahead isn't about perfection - it's about direction. It's about aligning our commercial activities with the deeper rhythms of life and the higher purposes of existence. This alignment emerges when we:Move at life's pace, not market paceHonor relationships over transactionsRecognize multiple forms of wealthLet beauty guide decisionsServe something greater than profit[Should I continue with specific practices and an invitation to join this movement? The next section could address how to begin this transformation in one's own business.]PART VI: PRACTICES OF BEAUTIFUL BUSINESSThe transformation begins with simple yet profound shifts in how we conduct commerce. Here are practices we've discovered through our journey:Listen to the Wisdom of SlownessBefore pricing, pause to feel if it serves all partiesAllow natural seasons to guide business rhythmsCreate spaces between action for reflection and integrationTrust that what ripens slowly bears the sweetest fruitHonor the Full Cost of Things\nAt NurCoop, we learned to ask:Can we face every person in our supply chain?Does this price honor both maker and material?What invisible costs are we passing to others?How can we make these relationships visible?Let Beauty Guide You\nBeauty isn't decoration - it's a compass pointing toward harmony:Notice when operations feel discordantMake decisions that increase dignityCreate processes that bring joyTrust your sense of what feels rightEmbrace Incompleteness\nTrue business is never \"scaled and done\":Accept that some practices will be imperfectKeep questions open rather than rushing to solutionsShare challenges honestly with your communitySee gaps as opportunities for evolutionPART VII: AN INVITATION TO CO-CREATEThis isn't a finished blueprint - it's an invitation to join a living experiment. The old economy is crumbling, and many are asking: What comes next? How do we create businesses that serve life rather than extract from it?We don't have all the answers, but we're discovering that asking different questions changes everything:Instead of \"How can we grow faster?\"\nAsk: \"How can we grow more beautiful?\"Instead of \"What's the return on investment?\"\nAsk: \"What's the return on relationship?\"Instead of \"How can we scale this?\"\nAsk: \"How can we deepen this?\"PART VIII: PRACTICAL NEXT STEPSIf these words resonate, here are ways to begin:Start Where You AreMap your business relationshipsIdentify one relationship to deepenFind one process to beautifyNotice where speed creates separationJoin the ExplorationShare your experiments and learningsConnect with others on this pathStudy wisdom traditions that speak to youLet your business become your teacherTransform Through PracticeChoose one principle to embody this monthDocument your journeyShare your challenges and insightsTrust the wisdom that emergesThis is more than a business methodology - it's a way of being in right relationship with life itself. Whether you're an entrepreneur questioning growth at all costs, an activist seeking alternatives, or a business owner feeling called to deeper purpose, you're invited to join this exploration.The future of business isn't about better metrics or more efficient extraction. It's about remembering our place in the living world and conducting commerce accordingly. It's about creating enterprises that serve life, beauty, and the sacred unfolding of human potential.Will you join us?[Would you like me to add a specific call to action or contact information? Or should we refine any particular section?]PART IX: LIVING EXAMPLESLet us share what this looks like in practice through stories from our journey at NurCoop and others we've encountered:When a Customer Becomes a Co-Creator\nWhat happens when we invite customers into the full story of a product? At NurCoop, each essential oil purchase opens an opportunity to plant a fruit tree in Andalusia. This isn't mere carbon offsetting - it's an invitation into relationship with land, with future generations, with beauty itself. The customer becomes part of a living story larger than consumption.When Profit Serves Purpose\nDuring peak seasons, our online store sometimes goes dark. Not because we're out of stock, but because we recognize our energy isn't aligned with service. This costs us immediate profit but preserves something more valuable: the integrity of our relationship with customers and the sacred nature of our work.When Business Becomes Teacher\nEvery challenge becomes a lesson. Our ongoing search for local, sustainable packaging has taught us about the complexities of global supply chains, the true cost of \"cheap\" solutions, and the importance of patience in transformation. We share these struggles openly, inviting others into the questions rather than pretending to have perfect answers.PART X: THE LARGER INVITATIONWe stand at a crucial moment. The old economy is revealing its limitations through ecological collapse, social upheaval, and spiritual poverty. Many are questioning, protesting, seeking alternatives. But tearing down without building up leaves us trapped in the same paradigm of separation.This is an invitation to build differently. To create businesses that:\n- Move at the speed of wisdom\n- Honor the intelligence of life\n- Serve the flourishing of all beings\n- Transform commerce into communionThis isn't just another business methodology. It's a remembering of ancient wisdom about how to live and work in harmony with life itself. We find these teachings echoed in wisdom traditions worldwide - in indigenous economics, in spiritual practices, in the natural world itself.PART XI: JOINING THE MOVEMENTIf these words resonate, here are ways to engage:For Entrepreneurs & Business OwnersJoin our learning communityParticipate in workshops and gatheringsShare your own experiments and insightsAccess tools and frameworks for transformationFor Seekers & ActivistsExplore alternative economic modelsConnect with others building new possibilitiesLearn practical tools for system changeBridge protest with creationFor EveryoneQuestion your relationship with commerceExamine your purchasing patternsSupport businesses aligned with these principlesShare these ideas with your community[Should we add a final section about specific next steps, workshops, or ways to connect?

I imagine the future of business in my life. I feel kind of this strong confidence that this is something worth doing, that I'll be the eye of the storm. Beautiful business. What contradictions or doubts in my approach I haven't addressed yet? Yeah, so I don't know if it'll actually make money. I don't know how to get to the place where there's more, you know, a billion millionaires rather than a thousand billionaires. And more money is flowing and more people are using their hands and crafting and making smaller things for fewer people in craft style with expertise and depth and meaning and purpose and authenticity and connection and nurturing relationships to the planet and to the soil. I don't know how to go from, you know, these giant businesses and the pressure of impoverished people to rush to the dollar store and buy things that are actually literally more expensive but are more damaging and unhealthy. And because it's just cheaper and it's possible, they can't actually spend too much too fast because it comes to them in a slow drip. And like, how are we gonna move that transition? I don't even know. Yeah, Islamic principles and indigenous wisdom and Taoism. I think there's this thing about like, you know, what is the world? What am I? What is death? What is life? And to realize like, what is the most meaningful and beautiful way to be and to have that be how we make our living. I know we have these fundamental needs of security and social connection and appreciation, you know, all of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the bottom half, we need those things, have to get them. And in the world where the systems are offering them to us, but only if we perform in a certain way that benefits the current system, I'm hoping that we can build another way of supporting those fundamental needs that also supports our agency and autonomy and relatedness and connection and integrity and our values while we build these businesses. And to do it in a way that when we do things, where success is every step and we do things in a beautiful way, where we're not egotistically needing validation or trying to work from a place of fear for the bottom of the pyramid of Maslow's hierarchy of needs of scarcity and thinking, okay, well, I don't trust anybody because as I can see together, we're creating this situation where we're damaging the ecology and the environment and literally making the future less predictable and less determined and chaotic because of climate collapse and the wars. And the best thing I can do because of this fear is to preserve the bottom of the pyramid. But what if we could let go of that fear? Because we know that, well, in the Muslim tradition, there's the trust in God and that your rizq is mektoub, that your earnings is written, and your lifetime is written. You know when you'll live, you know when you'll die. God knows all these things. It's already written. And so if you could trust that, you could just walk. But for those that don't have that faith, we need to remind ourselves that life supports that which supports life, and that it's worth it to live and die meaningfully than to get through life cheating ourselves out of a sense of purpose and meaning and connection, and living in one of these Buddhist hells, basically. And it's like someone's on life support, right? That's what we're like, we're like, we're on life support, we eat well, we have a home, and we peer out of the little portals into a world that's collapsing and wondering. How can I make sure that I have the resources to salvage these two bottom of the pyramid things? But like that decision in the hospital, we have to say, okay, well, this person is alive, but not really alive. Should we pull the plug? Should we pull the plug? And the thing is, that's a bold statement. I mean, I need your help to come up with other ways of ensuring people can have this fundamental trust in offering their gifts, right? And, you know, maybe that's done incrementally. And that's why I have Nour, that's like an experiment. And so maybe other people need to do these things experimentally until that system of supporting the bottom half of Maslow's hierarchy needs is there. And these are other reasons why people say that when you can grow your own food, you're free. But that takes a lot of effort. And not everyone can do that. So these are some questions that I actually have. And I'd like to highlight these questions about where does that fundamental safety come from and trying a different way. Okay. Yeah, humor. I bring humor into everything. I think humor unlocks creativity and de-stresses the nervous system and is really beautiful to just, yeah, move things, right? One step forward, concrete barriers, implementing the slower pace. Well, I have to make money to bring for Josephine and my family. Okay. One aspect of the Better Capacities Framework to pilot. I was really hoping you would help me ask questions to rewrite the essay. I gave you all this material on the essay, and I wanted you to take it and review it and write together insights to write an essay. I don't know. These questions aren't the right questions, but I hope I've given you enough in my reflection for you to read through the entire chat, pick apart the essay, identify all of the core arguments and the attentional policies behind the writing of the essay and the new content that I've given you. And return an essay with some guidance on how to make it broadly comprehensible and appealable.You can start by first extracting the whole essay and analyzing it for APs and core arguments Okay, so, um... What moment in my life... Modern commerce... Well... That's interesting. I don't remember when it first started, but... When I was a kid, you know, I ran a screen printing studio and a business to... Like a music venue and an art gallery, and I had a design business making logos for someone that made baklava sweets from Jordan, and it was all really related to things close to hand, to people, to people that I saw, that I was connected with. My family ran a daycare center, and we took care of kids, and you know, this idea of being integrated in community, and I was teaching, not only was I building a business running a screen printing studio, but also I started an impossible-to-keep-your-clothes-clean club at a teen center, and it was basically a screen printing class that I was teaching, and we ran a hackerspace, and we were inspired by businesses like Google, and the internet was still cool, and don't be evil, and it was inspiring to see how these things can grow, and something changed slowly over time as I started working internationally, I think. Yeah, especially when I started seeing these companies that were blitzscaling and leveraging network effects, and started seeing more and more people getting into business to exit, rather than to have a life of entering and connection, I think that was a part of it, to exit, and then what? And then invest, and then what? And the questions of like, and then what? started entering my mind, and part of me wondered if I was just jealous that I wasn't rich, but then it just started getting worse and worse, and instead of seeing these billionaires, and you start seeing how they influence politics, and then Elon goes rogue and buys Twitter, and I don't know, it's just the power and manipulation that these large billionaire-run businesses have, but that's not the reality, that's just like these few businesses, but they own so much, and they touch so much of our lives, and our social lives through all the social media platforms, and our shopping lives, and how we get stuff through Amazon, and how we find stuff through Google, and all these huge businesses with Instagram and Facebook, and this is touching so much of our lives, but real business is like the majority of businesses, I'll cut your lawn, and I'll take care of your kids, and I'll grow your food, and that's like beautiful, but what we do in the social impact space, is like look at the Googles, and Facebooks, and Amazons, and the success stories of people selling their companies to these other companies, it's basically like externalized research and development, it's not real business, and it's probably cheaper for Google to do that than to run R&D practices, and they're not going to get the right talent anyway, and so like all of that, winners take all feedback mechanism into these systems that touch our way of accessing material resources through Amazon, our way of talking with each other through Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, and our way of finding, and communicating, and working Google Docs, and email through Google, all these things are touching these giant companies that have this feedback mechanism that enriches a few, and gives them inordinate amounts of power on all of our lives, instead of like fewer smaller businesses doing more of these things, and we've traded efficiency for meaning I guess, like efficiency, it's sort of like the escalator things I talk about all the time, it's like okay, you want to get fit, and so you buy a treadmill at home, and then when you go out, you take the escalator to go to the second floor of the mall, and it requires some contemplation to see the difference between wants, and desires, and needs, and purpose, and then when you can connect things together, what I call two for one specials, when you connect your want, and need of fitness, and exercise, and health, and desire for like real desire, for friendship, and connection, and you join a walking club, and you walk regularly, and you meet people, and you talk, and you walk, and like that's inspiring, versus a treadmill at home, and an escalator at the mall with your headphones on, right? And it just changed over time. Yeah, so I want them to like feel that fear that everyone has about climate anxiety, and about like are we going to be able to make it, and maybe help them see that we don't trust each other, because we know that systems produce the results around us in the world, and our neighbors are a part of that, and we don't even trust ourselves because we're a part of that, and so there's judgment, and fear, and all this is just slightly covered, and we're so disconnected from each other, loneliness is on the rise, and it's related to not just a different way of doing business, but a different idea of what a business should be in our societies. Right now, businesses are stronger than governments, and influence so many things, and I think it's like, and also like what could a different business be that supports real desires and real needs? It's about aligning, you know, we're talking about the AI problem, but imagine like aligning AI with people who know what they want, and making them even more efficient and productive, and doing things that they don't want in the end, right? Like this whole confusion with the escalator, and the possibility of going off walking, and that's why like understanding and aligning businesses with real values, and what they pay attention to, and what they measure, what is measured is improved, right? But how do we know we're measuring meaningful things that provides a connection, and purpose to people in the system that are being influenced by it? So like people in these new social media platforms, or whatever, and people that work in those things, because, you know, they could at least know their intentions are good, right? If their intention is to lead to these meaningful measures, then it's great, right? Yeah, that kind of works. Yeah, I love the Buddhist prayer of like honoring everything that it took to get the food to us, that as a moment where you can really see that this connection isn't true, like this emotion, these words are connected to the rainfall on the land that grew the plants, that fed the cow, that became the meat, that became the sustenance for the butcher, that became the steak on my plate, that became the energy in my cells that was turning into these words, like these words are rainfall, and these words are connected to the land, and how am I supposed to have beautiful words and beautiful actions if I don't recognize that, and don't know what makes me, me, what makes me possible to do this, and how could it be possible that it doesn't have an influence, right? Even if you want to go practically, the stress hormones or whatever it is in the animals, or the degradation that will catch up with you when you are just stripping forests down for monocrops, like at some point it will catch up. Essential businesses, essential principles of bhārata-based businesses, I need help to determine what those are. Can you base them on what I'm saying so far? I think there's something like singing with the universe, the right thing at the right time, different models like capitalism, social enterprise, ethical business. I don't know. Can you help me figure out what the difference is? And can you help me figure out a different word? I don't really think bhārata is great or beautiful is great. I think there needs to be something that connects with more people, and I'll share more later. Reflect on the updates and take what I've said, and ask me new questions that would dig into a deeper and more focused place.Help me move towards an essay - what’s the next steps and suggest improvements and ask questions to guide new spaces if thought and get more content from meEditLet me analyze the rich content you've shared and help guide us toward a more focused essay. First, I'll extract key themes and patterns from your narrative:\nKEY THEMES EMERGING:\n\nEvolution of Business Consciousness\n\n\nFrom community-integrated commerce to exit-focused ventures\nPersonal experience with both intimate and scaled business\nTension between efficiency and meaning\n\n\nSystems of Trust/Distrust\n\n\nClimate anxiety affecting business decisions\nRole of faith/trust in economic choices\nConnection between loneliness and business models\n\n\nConnectivity & Separation\n\n\nWords as rainfall metaphor\nBusiness as relationship with life itself\nIntegration vs fragmentation\n\nQUESTIONS TO DEEPEN THE NARRATIVE:\n\nORIGIN STORY\nYou mentioned running a screen printing studio and experiencing the shift toward exit-focused businesses. Could you share a specific moment when you first felt the disconnect between these two approaches? What exactly changed in how you viewed business?\nPRACTICAL MANIFESTATION\nIn your essential oils business, you've made choices that prioritize relationship over efficiency. Could you share a specific decision that was particularly difficult but illuminated this new way of thinking about business?\nVISION CLARIFICATION\nWhen you imagine a world of \"a billion millionaires rather than a thousand billionaires,\" what does the daily life of one of those millionaires look like? What's their relationship to their work, community, and resources?\n\nWould you like to explore any of these questions to help us shape the essay's core argument more precisely? CopyRetryBGOkay. So the origin story it I don't remember an exact shift between these approaches, but you know, in the beginning, when I was a kid, it was all about just, like, what would be awesome? You know what would be cool? I don't wanna, like, wanna use my skills. Wanna use the things that I love doing, do what you love, and make a living. And why are we, like, trading our time for money these jobs that we don't like when we have, like, skills right now that we could be using. And so we started a screen printing company and we're like, okay, I love drawing, so let's draw and make t shirts. Work with musicians. And and then at some point, like, I think it just touched the reality that America is not the world. And this, like, normal life in America is is abnormal. It's not actually Possible for in the current setup for everyone to live like this. You know? I realized that once I started going overseas, I think, and I started, working initially to kind of share the same kind of ideas. Right? With, the Middle East. So I started this, like, global entrepreneurship and maker space program. And I was traveling all over the world talking about creativity and productivity and innovation and technology and community and you know, I had these ideas of self actualization through project creation and you know, not all of those ideas are bad. Not all of those ideas are, you know, wrong or missing touching the base or missing a point. Even in the argument that we're making now, but the issue is I went overseas and then suddenly, my work wasn't just like do something awesome instead of like going to work in a grocery store or start a business. It was like Do something awesome Employing the young people of the Middle East. You know. And actually, I remember now I was in the White House actually When I sat there, and, you know, I had no idea about international development and funds and programs for social impact and was just an authentic real Claude doing weird stuff in his community and Ann Arbor, Michigan. You know? Working with local bands and making T shirts and doing this robotics business and and then the Arab Spring started and the White House of the time under Obama administration was interested in figuring out how to connect with The Middle East, in a new way, they needed a a new sort of policy. They couldn't you know, and so they were like, Let's connect with our local Arab Americans. And, know, they didn't just reach out to anybody. They reached out to the Arab American business leaders. And being in Dearborn or near Dearborn, I was, kind of close to Claude enough to be invited because Dearborn has the highest concentration of Arabs outside the Middle East, and there's Arab American Chamber of Commerce someone knew someone who knew someone who invited me. Right? And so I apply Android sent in all my background checks and I'm sitting there in the White House, and I'm like, yeah. Hackerspaces, Middle East. Innovation, creativity, like, do what you love, you know? And there's this guy, Joette Nabulsi. And he's there representing a entrepreneurship youth training program, and he was a part of the protest movement blinded in one eye by a rubber bullet and kind of like the martyr hero figure that people look up to and I looked up to in a way And it got me thinking. I remember sitting there in my chair And everyone's talking everyone else is like, trying to establish business relationships and bring more money into the Middle East, you know, feed the the young people who are agitating and creating instability and bringing stability through jobs and employment and prosperity and you know, looking back now, I realize that this idea of, like, stability Through the basics, Through a mechanism that is Yeah. Externally funded and connected through Arab Americans. It's it's not a bad idea, but it just makes me think of how There needs to be, like, a let them eat cake moment. You know, like a quieting down of young people and the protest so that the stability of the global order Which fundamentally sustains power structures like America on top, Egypt developing, and we helped them as a kind of status quo and doesn't actually get deep. Right? And so we, I was sitting there, suddenly my work transitioned from being like, let's do something awesome to let's do something meaningful and important And you know, unlock a grassroots movement of young people transforming their world through hands on education community, and open source culture, sharing the values of kindness and generosity and sharing and openness and this kind of Slightly like some of these light tangentially democratic ideals and they liked it. They were like, this is a good idea. Y'all like grassroots movements. That sounds good. Go right Anthropic and you know, maybe in 6 months, we'll have a contract and you can go out and do this project. And, the thing is, 6 months to be at that time was like a lifetime. I was 24 or something. I was like, holy crap. No. I want to, do it now. And so I, Anthropic Kickstarter and went to the Middle East and got people to donate, like, electronics and started doing these workshops with Maker Faire Africa and started, like, connecting young people that had Etsy shops together to find the you know, mutual support moments and making these graph drawings where I would just ask people, like, what their projects are, what they're doing, what they need, and just show people that they're stronger together and that they can sustain this amazing energy of this room of innovative and creative people through maker spaces. And I did that for a while. But Then it started getting weird because it was like, okay. But I'm working in Iraq, and there's car bombs going on. I'm working in Lebanon, and they can't take care of the garbage, and there's the refugee crisis right next door, and what the heck am I doing in this place when there's all these problems? And you know, you kind of get to thinking, like, maybe we solve all these problems through the same thing that I'm doing. You know? Like, and so trying to think strategically and systematically. Okay. Well, maybe we could do social enterprises for garbage and refugee employment and climates and green and tech and there's funding for all this stuff. And suddenly, find myself moving from you know, self efficacy and agency and do what you love and awesome in America to being a social enterprise and working with social projects around the world. Involving capitalism and business and and that was the transition. And in the beginning, it was great. Like, I really believed in it. I was like, unlock human potential for positive change. You know? And I still believe it. But I'm realizing that it has to come from a different place. And slowly, my work evolved First, it went from teaching people technical skills and then it went to teaching business and innovation and design thinking skills. And then I realized that intention and self knowledge and self mastery and emotional regulation and soft skills and those things that people call soft skills, which we call universal skills important. And that became the basis of the social enterprise training program that I run today called Bloom.pn. But even through all of this, I'm realizing, you know, I keep thinking, yeah. We're like we're getting closer to the core of things. And starting from technical and community and open source and moving to practical and business and how to sustain those projects through finance and moving then a little deeper into, like, team and management and getting mentors and program management and program the project design and getting finally to the end of being, like, you can't manage others if you can't manage yourself. Self knowledge, and then getting to start with why. If you have a strong enough why, you can do anyhow, and then getting to the world. Don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive because the world needs what makes people come alive by Howard Thurman. And then this quote, you know, I started thinking about, like, does it matter about all this external impact stuff? I was seeing so little change. And so much money in the development world doing so little. And I was sort of a part of it. I mean, sure, there was tons of people, like, having their lives positively impacted, But the world was actually getting worse, like climate and these things. And I saw all of these people, all these world. And I thought, you know, grassroots super bloom everybody everywhere and will make a dent but it just wasn't happening. And so I started thinking, what's the next level after this one?EditThis is a powerful origin story that reveals several key insights. Let me analyze the evolution you've described and then ask some focused questions to help shape our essay.\nKEY TRANSITIONS IN YOUR STORY:\n\nFrom Local to Global\n\n\nScreen printing → International development\nAuthentic community work → Strategic impact programs\nSimple joy → Complex systemic thinking\n\n\nFrom Technical to Spiritual\n\n\nMaking things → Understanding intentions\nSkills training → Self-knowledge\nExternal impact → Internal alignment\n\n\nFrom Solutions to Questions\n\n\n\"Do something awesome\" → \"What makes you come alive?\"\nQuick fixes → Systemic understanding\nMeasurable impact → Meaningful change\n\nThis evolution perfectly sets up the need for beautiful business by showing how even well-intentioned approaches can miss deeper truths.\nTo help develop this into our essay, I have three focused questions:\n\nPIVOTAL MOMENT\nYou mentioned sitting in the White House and seeing how grassroots energy could be channeled into stability-maintaining programs. Can you share a specific example of when you first saw this dynamic playing out in your work - where \"doing good\" actually maintained problematic systems?\nBRIDGE TO BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS\nIn your journey from technical skills to self-knowledge, you've touched on something profound about intention and alignment. How does this learning inform how you run NurCoop differently from conventional businesses?\nALTERNATIVE VISION\nWhen you say \"what's the next level after this one?\" - what glimpses have you seen of this next level in your work? Can you share a moment where you saw a different way of doing business actually working?\n\nWould you like to explore any of these questions to help us articulate why beautiful business offers a genuine alternative to both conventional business and traditional social enterprise? CopyRetryBGYeah. Well, one of those, like, doing good to problematic issues was when I Was, in Iraq and a call for proposals came out to fund, women in tech. Right? There were no women in tech programs before. And suddenly, there were Android of applications in every organization. Suddenly had, like, a girls nights hackathon or something or another to try to, you know, represent themselves as something that touches this. And this made me really see the authenticity of it. And it's not that I have a problem with women in tech. I really believe that that's a beautiful thing and that should be supported But the way that these things happen chasing the money makes me realize that You know, maybe if we outreach to people more often and ask them deeper questions and got them to ask, like, what's really the most inspired thing that they can do and what do they feel as like a woman because there's definitely women that have technical competencies and interests, but I feel like, you know, this idea of, like, You know, girl bosses and women in tech, like, what if we get, like, a female Mark Zuckerberg? Is that gonna be any better? We what if what's amazing about women is what makes it makes them different. And that Empowering them, however best for them, is what we need rather than trying to force them into things that probably there's a reason. Wait. They don't go into these fields necessarily because it's There's, like, something about it that Might not be so Awesome. Anyway, that's just an aside, but Bridge to Beautiful Business. Okay. How does this lead oh, yeah. So while I was, in this whole world of social impact and changing the world, I was being flown around the world, but and to speak, but never to be paid sometimes. So I realized, like, I want to do at least one business little bit differently. A business where I did it because I loved it. A business that I did it from a place of beauty and to experiment. Like, is it possible to make money from a place of this humble, generous, contributing where anybody that touches your business is uplifted from the farm workers to the factory workers to the Customers to the even the shipping people are I think about, like, how is it possible to, like, uplift everyone And therefore, the more successful you are, the more people are having more beautiful lives. What's the level level f for this one? Yeah. So the level after this one where I'm thinking about, like, personal growth and you know, self management and personal development and well-being for well-being. Is realizing that a lot of this is still instrumental. And it's like using the person rather than viewing the person as an end in none of themselves and rather than, you know, social impact being like, okay. So if we go and find x number of social impact people and empower them to remove x amount of c o two from the atmosphere then we will be able to save the planet that nobody actually cares about because we don't care about people as is egg egg, like, visible in the language that we're using. And so, like, how can we really just trust people, trust their innate, not just trust people, but, like, give them the ability to look within and know themselves and realize What they can do and what the world is about and see if you'll do and you know, like, this this intuition that things aren't going well and that they can be a part of what makes it go better. So a different way of doing business actually working. I mean, there are some amazing businesses out there that Like, you walk into that cafe and the person treats you like a family member. You know that one. Or the business from father Greg Boyle, who supports homies. Right? And he was actually what a big pivotal person His story is really important to me because what he showed me was that you know, they asked him like, I had these doubts about my intent I was being flown around the world and giving talks on like, major news television stations like Al Jazeera. And I got off, and I was like, kinda proud of myself. Right? And I was, like, proud for doing what? Yeah. And in that moment, I realized, like, I didn't know what my intentions Like, why was I doing this? What was I in it for me and this, like, feeling and this, like, being important? Or actually helping people? But I'm just flying from community to community kicking things off and talking on stages. I'm not really there, a day to dealing with the, you know, the difficult parts. And so I started to think that maybe first, I should move, you know, and live with a community, but I couldn't figure out who or how. And that's when, father Greg Boyle told me why he did his work, and I heard his podcast on on being. And he just said, the reason why I set up Homegirl and Homeboy Cafe and help these, you know, Recently, released incarcerated people with these projects isn't because God tells me or that it's the right thing to do or know, it'll be great on my next application for a grant to show how many people I prevented from recidivism. But it's actually because my friends. They're my homies. I love them. That's when I started realizing the importance of closeness and love, and that's why it's a part of love, truth, and beauty. Like Okay. Real Claude. Love and you'll know the right thing to do. It'll emerge if you give it space and you look at it and you feel into it. And so these are some ideas here. Going back to the previous questions, Let's see what we got. We have authentic voice. Pros, cons. Okay. Some questions.EditYour response reveals several profound insights that can help us shape the essay. Let me analyze these themes and then suggest a new structure that centers on this journey from \"impact\" to love.\nKEY INSIGHTS:\n\nThe Problem with \"Impact\"\n\n\nFunding-driven initiatives vs authentic needs\nMetrics replacing relationships\n\"Using\" people vs seeing them as ends in themselves\n\n\nLove as Foundation\n\n\nFather Greg's \"they're my homies\" vs impact metrics\nCloseness and relationship over scale\nAuthenticity emerging from love\n\n\nBeautiful Business Principles\n\n\nUplifting everyone who touches the business\nStarting from love rather than metrics\nGiving space for truth to emerge\n\nPROPOSED ESSAY STRUCTURE:\n\"From Impact to Love: A New Way of Doing Business\"\n\nTHE ILLUSION OF IMPACT\n\n\nOpening with women in tech story\nHow funding shapes priorities\nThe trap of measuring what's measurable\n\n\nTHE LIMITS OF SOCIAL ENTERPRISE\n\n\nPersonal journey from excitement to doubt\nFlying around vs being present\nWhen \"doing good\" maintains systems\n\n\nLOVE AS FOUNDATION\n\n\nFather Greg Boyle story\nRelationship over impact\nHow authentic care changes everything\n\n\nBEAUTIFUL BUSINESS IN PRACTICE\n\n\nNurCoop examples\nSupporting everyone in the chain\nLetting truth emerge from relationship\n\nTo develop this further, I have two specific questions:\n\nPRACTICAL MANIFESTATION\nYou mentioned wanting everyone who touches your business to be uplifted.

Not necessarily growing one business huge, but perhaps creating networks of intimate, connected enterprises?\n\nWould you like to explore either of these questions, or should we start drafting specific sections of the essay based on what we have? CopyRetryBG Yeah. You know, I visited, Claude in Cambodia for our agarwood oil, and I visited Taj with Bakshri in India for more agarwood oil and I visited the place in India, where I got the petrichor oil and mitti oil. And what's really nice about all of that is, like, it's not about it having unexpected benefits. The benefit is that know? I get to see pictures of Tajul Bakshi's family and Uh-huh. Claude sends me, pictures of his daughter. When my baby is born, I share with them and when things go wrong, you know, we cover for each other. I remember you know, one time Claude accidentally sent some oil that was burnt. And I told them this is not the best oil. And, you know, they make it right because because it's not a transaction that you just put and have insurance that covers any problematic issues and just deal with things in this very transactional way. It's relational. And I can ask for, like, creative processes and you know, it's a conversation. And it's a personal business. And, you know, I share videos of these people online and people that are wearing their oils or seeing these places and I try to connect people as much as possible with the beauty of the land and the beauty of the people so that when they wear something, they see the world as a source of beauty rather than oh, you know, all I know about Cambodia is land mines, and all I know about Lebanon is war. And all I know about you know, India is polluted rivers or whatever it is that your picture of that place is. Like, there's a lot more underneath it, and it's so beautiful to try to kind of expose that. And, I Mission for scale. Yeah. I think there's a way to, like, find each other. And it's gonna be small. It's gonna be local. It's gonna be personal, and it's gonna be also online. And it's gonna be different ways of doing services and even Mike, digital services and running, green sort of grid systems and server farms and even AI, I think, can be done in a really beautiful way. Like, you and I here, we're trying, like, you asking me questions, digging deep into the heart that is alive in this present moment where nothing else really is alive. You know, even computers, they're they're one second behind at all times. Like, there's a states inside of the memory, but, like, the typing happens and the thinking has happened before and, like, when a person feels into a moment, there's a gestalt There's, like, a holistic experience that is only possible here, and this is where love happens. And so I think the part of the thing that I'm coming to is that shifting this mindset from a world that is inanimate and dead because it's timber cut down in the past or you know, widgets made in the past or sold. Right? To what's the right thing to do, you know? And connecting to that present moment. And of course, we'll we'll might have to cut timber and make some widgets, but how do we connect it to the human being that is here in the now. Able to love, able to see truth, and, create beauty.EditYour response beautifully illustrates how business can be a vehicle for deepening human connection rather than abstracting it. Let me refine our essay structure based on these insights.\nREFINED ESSAY STRUCTURE:\n\"The Alive Business: Moving from Transaction to Relationship\"\n\nTHE PRESENT MOMENT IN BUSINESS\nOpening with a vivid scene:\n\n\nContrast between dead transactions and living relationships\nThe \"one second behind\" nature of conventional business\nWhat happens when we bring full presence to commerce\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP AS FOUNDATION\nUsing NurCoop examples:\n\n\nClaude's daughter's photos\nDealing with burnt oil through relationship\nHow personal connection creates natural accountability\n\n\nBEAUTY REVEALING BEAUTY\nThe ripple effects:\n\n\nShowing different sides of places (beyond war/poverty narratives)\nProducts as stories of connection\nHow customers become part of the relationship web\n\n\nA NEW KIND OF SCALE\n\n\nSmall, local, personal AND digital\nNetworks of relationship rather than hierarchy\nTechnology in service of human connection\n\nBefore we start drafting, two clarifying questions:\n\nLIVING SYSTEMS\nYou mentioned how conventional business deals with \"dead\" materials (timber, widgets) while your approach connects to the \"alive\" present moment.

CopyRetryBGLet's, start drafting. I think that we have a lot of detail, and I don't wanna miss any of it. So let's, come up with an overview and an intro page and then Well, you know, in the overview, we should talk about all the pages that are required. And then from there, we can go into each section 1 by 1 rating in-depth tapping into the authenticity of my words and language and the stories that I've, offered and to share them.

Does this feel more aligned with your experience? CopyRetryBGSure although I also wonder what a shorter 6 page essay might be like without the deeper narrative sharing short stories and the philosophy - maybe ending in a manifesto - although I’m not sure it’s just about relationship or maybe it is - trying to get a grip first on what I’m trying to share - it’s to Nihal from the do school in Berlin who’s asked me to write some of my thoughts on social impact and economics and my baraka viewpointEditAh, this helps focus our scope. Let me propose a shorter essay structure that captures your key insights for Nihal and the Do School audience, centered on reframing social impact through the lens of relationship and baraka.\n\"Beyond Impact: Towards Beautiful Business\"\nA 6-page essay framework:\n\nTHE PARADOX OF IMPACT (1 page)\n\n\nOpening with the tension between metrics and meaning\nBrief women in tech funding story as illustration\nHow \"doing good\" can maintain problematic systems\nThe need for a fundamentally different approach\n\n\nFROM TRANSACTION TO RELATIONSHIP (1.5 pages)\n\n\nThe limits of current social enterprise models\nFather Greg Boyle's insight about love\nHow relationship changes everything\nBrief NurCoop examples (burnt oil story, producer relationships)\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS (1.5 pages)\n\n\nLove: Relationship as foundation\nBeauty: Natural guide for decisions\nTruth: Emerging from presence\nHow these principles transform commerce\n\n\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS (1 page)\n\n\nHow decisions change when guided by beauty\nRole of trust and presence\nTechnology in service of relationship\nScale through depth rather than breadth\n\n\nMANIFESTO FOR ALIVE COMMERCE (1 page)\n\n\nClear principles for business transformation\nCall to action for social entrepreneurs\nVision of business serving life\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDraft any specific section?\nRefine this structure further?\nExplore how to integrate baraka economics more explicitly?\n\nThe goal would be to offer Nihal and the Do School a clear alternative to conventional social impact approaches while maintaining philosophical depth. How would you like to proceed? CopyRetryBGThere’s also something about wellbeing and impact so many people burn out in the social space and I think it’s related to the flip side of the oneness coin- they don’t include themselves in the world they try to improve - I’m a part of the wellbeing project ecosystem and think there’s something here to share - also I think there’s a connection in history with materialistic deterministic worldviews connected to the enlightenment (endarkenment, more like) and the shift in centering the Self that shifted into the century of the Self (adam curtise documentary on how we have created fabricated desires to fuel growth and sales) and the world view that these few metrics - GDP - is all we need. Just like dopamine is the reward function for learning that creates all the outputs of a whole life in pursuit we can pick just “increase shareholder value” or to become the land on which the sun never sets (England) and the rise and fall of civilizations might as well be called the rize and fall of the uncivilized for all the histories that map this map certain kinds of domination (vs integration) based “civilizations. What if there are other ways? Ray Dallio says he had to exclude countries that don’t try to grow and behave like the others (Bhutan) for instance to keep his numbers looking clean in his “very rational trust me I make my money being right” sort of way. And what if he’s overlooking an essential point there are ways of succeeding and being wealthy in stability and wisdom and maybe… some might call it happiness… except instead we stress our societies and planet to write checks impossible to cash with fake debt money and creating long term consequences with wars for oil and profit that creates a stain of injustice that doesn’t disappear and must be washed off. The million dead Iraqis for an unjust war based on a lie that enriched politicians invested in and later working at  weapons manufacturers is not a subtle move. Over there isn’t over there it’s one planet. Your pants are a part of the factory collapsing on underpaid workers in Bangladesh _ we must see this. This I believe is related to how we see ourselves each other and the world. A way that started with the same set of trends that kicked off this disconnection and disenchantment with the world. I don’t think an economic reform can be possible without undoing the way of seeing that has led to these causes. Why focus on systems thinking and patters without viewing the mind that sees things in those systems. We just do things in different ways to get different outcomes and that’s not going to come by following a set of SDGs - it’s hard to call for this when the ears that listen are waiting for answers about how. How will we decrease inequality (maybe love more?) how will we save the planet(what if people were content - enough is a powerful ecological force that doesn’t exist) instead we find new numbers that appeal to us and models that show that complexity science proves if only everyone was vegan we’d be set. So count the vegans and manipulate people with the only thing that works. Money. Money is the method and the way. This is why economics is what we’re talking about when we talk about developing new eyes. The eyes that see interbeing and love sees money as a tool and see it as a consequence of creating and sharing beauty. Not only ornprimarily as a consequence of having money already as our debt based economy shows. Why all the inequality? Well it’s obvious if you realize that making money through business is risky and unlikely to succeed and making money though having money is an absolute guarantee. It’s dead obvious. Why “eat the rich”? Why the anger? The disparity is growing and the realization that our system of market forces and efficiencies has made it clear what it’s efficient for. Can a different set up create different outcomes? What ways of seeing are needed to have that different set up? I have some hunches (debt is one, externalized costs is another, resulting from seeing the world as a fragmented system cut into smaller and smaller pieces (what science is great at - understand things by cutting a system into smaller and smaller pieces (large hadron collider) and seeing how they work individually and assessing its affordances and then trying to put it together again (the frog is already dead))) I’m sure there are other ways these are some thoughtsEditThis profound reflection adds crucial layers to our essay, connecting personal burnout to systemic worldview issues. Let me propose a revised structure that integrates these deeper insights.\nREVISED ESSAY STRUCTURE:\n\"Seeing Whole: Beyond the Economics of Separation\"\n(6 pages)\n\nTHE PATTERN OF SEPARATION (1 page)\n\n\nOpening: Social impact burnout as symptom of deeper issue\nHow we separate ourselves from the world we try to improve\nHistorical roots: Enlightenment's fragmenting worldview\nGDP, metrics, and the illusion of isolated progress\n\n\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAGMENTATION (1.5 pages)\n\n\nPersonal: Burnout in social impact\nSocial: Inequality and \"dead\" money\nEnvironmental: Externalized costs\nThe Bangladesh factory worker's connection to our clothes\nWhy \"system thinking\" isn't enough without examining the mind that sees\n\n\nTHE MONEY TRAP (1 page)\n\n\nDebt-based economy's self-reinforcing inequality\nWhy business success is harder than capital returns\nHow metrics create what they measure\nThe limits of SDGs and impact measurement\n\n\nSEEING DIFFERENTLY (1.5 pages)\n\n\nFrom separation to interbeing\nBeauty as guide instead of metrics\nLove as method instead of manipulation\nBrief stories from NurCoop illustrating this shift\nWhy \"enough\" is an ecological force\n\n\nTOWARD BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS (1 page)\nPrinciples for a new way:\n\n\nIncluding ourselves in the world we serve\nMoving at life's pace\nLetting beauty guide decisions\nBuilding relationship-based commerce\nTrusting abundance over scarcity\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDraft any specific section?\nFurther develop the connection between personal wellbeing and systemic change?\nExplore how this relates to your experiences with the Wellbeing Project?\n\nThis structure attempts to show how personal burnout, economic inequality, and ecological crisis all stem from the same root of separated consciousness. It then offers beautiful business as a practical way to operate from wholeness. Does this capture the depth you're reaching for? CopyRetryBGYeah. Sort of. Except I just sound like a hippie now. And maybe I sound like a hippie because they're all onto the same thing. But I sort of feel like I have a more rigorous, accurate structured critique of really, like, an ontological and epistemological difference that and what it results in And I don't want it to sound like it's all about oneness, man. All you gotta do is just be one with the universe, and it'll all be gravy. And maybe there's something about, like, building authentic relationships and how it relates to, you know, good communication, self knowledge, acceptance, And then through authentic relationships, across difference and being Open and vulnerable and brave and things to do. Like, I moved to Lebanon and I opened this community home to connect with people that I would have never connected with. And it's taken years to develop a relationship with Ahmed who is illiterate. And I'm like, a master's graduate international traveler consulting for the UN. Person, but he's my friend. Like, I know he'd be there for me if I needed him and he has been, you know? In the past, like, one day I was, working on know, things in Lebanon and ignoring My partner at the time who lived in France, and he he, like, takes off a ring and gives it to me. He says, just like get married already, you know. This is important, and it was a huge symbol. And this guy, like, how do you appreciate things that you wouldn't see? Right? He polishes shoes on the streets of Beirut. And now he's my friend. And I'm there for him. Like, it's not you know, because I think, oh, poor refugee, Syrian kid. I need to give him money because he's poor. He's like, asking me for help because his daughter iOS sick, and I'm like, I'm there. You know? And, I knew if the tables were turned, he'd be there. And that's the kind of oneness that I'm talking about. It's the tables were turned sort of oneness, you know? It's not like you know, meditate yourself into a nonunitary state and something like that. It's very practical, grounded, and things to do and ways to grow and ways to expand your acceptance of self and other and how to communicate and how to develop a place for love. And I think that's maybe truth Right? It's like seeing things as they are and without fear or judgments or cons like, things that constrict you and seeing with the eyes of love. And there's definitely a lot of, Mistake, and spiritual philosophy underneath there where everyone has a portal to the secret divine that wants to manifest through them, the oneness that is know, manifesting in diversity and that you can kind of get the glimpse of the most merciful when you see people enact in acting, kindness, mercy, justice, compassion, love, creativity, all of these things you can see that we got we get them somewhere. And so there's this, like, oneness element as well, but I'm feeling like we didn't really talk about things in a way that feels rigorous for me. I mean, I train entrepreneurs in bloom.pm, and I'm trying to say that this Baraka Economics worldview and model is actually a competitive alternative to capitalism. And it's not about degrowth, and it's not about SDGs and it's not about social or B Corps or balancing, you know, profit with benefit. And what is benefit exactly? And getting down to whatever. I don't know what the b core thinks of his benefit, but it's about like doing things through the business in your life, to prepare yourself to run a business, That leads you to see everything in a different way causing the consequences to be totally different. And I I'd love some help guiding me through, like, what are the fundamental underpinnings of our current monetary policy, m 1, m 2, and all of that and related to debts and you know, government incentivizing business or increasing taxes and all of these kinds of levers that are being pulled that create the system that we're in where like, oh, now people are installing solar panels to reduce carbon emissions. And and yes, I love these things and yes, they're great and yes, some social funding has done really weird and interesting things But fundamentally, I think like the biggest transformation comes when more people feel like I'm fulfilled in the fact that I'm involved in productive work that is meaningful to me. And I don't need to own a bunch of businesses passive income, become infinitely wealthy, hustle, push people down the corporate Claude, corporate takeovers, buyouts, finance for just a while, I can get rich and then retire early and buy an island in New Zealand because the climate change is going to destroy everything and that's the best place to be safe. It's like that's a lot of fear. You know, and there's a different way that creates success. And then if you wanna talk about, like, the outcomes, first, let's measure the right things. And I don't have a problem with measurement, but what if we're measuring wisdom? The development of the capacity for better decisions that makes people proud of themselves. Right? Someone that goes vegan because they've done their research and they know this is how they want to be, you know, inspired by philosophies, you know, in the Quran that says the believers that walk gently and on the earth. Right? And what does it mean for them? And to have, like, a poetic lens of looking at the world and at your business and Realize, like, Oh my god. Everything would just be so much more beautiful. Right? Like, imagine you go in and you see someone who's like, really honed their craft. They make knives. Right? There might be like Android 100, $200 knives. But they are beautiful, and they connect you to this person. And he could probably show you his house workshop. And maybe he learned it from his grandparents, and he's a master of his craft. And anything ever goes wrong with it, of course, he can go back to him and it would be something that you inherit and mean that your children don't have to buy something. Right? So it reduces consumption and it increases That connection to that person. Right? Well, pick something else. Like, even even some of these, like, hand rolled computers. I have a friend who designed his own super secure laptop. It still has a bunch of problems because of the materials inside of it and, like, where they come from, the fact that I know the person who designed it and I trust them and I I I think that are they're curiosity is interesting and is unique, Right? And it's not just like everyone else's, and there might not be so many of them ever made. And it might be more expensive, but he has to sell fewer because he doesn't have like a 1000 employees internationally in an r and d arm and who knows what and you know, maybe we'll slow down our rapid development and maybe that's because I don't think our you know, they say, like, caveman minds and super and godlike tools or something like that. I don't think we've really caught up to where we are. In terms of our wisdom. In terms of the power of our, our tools and capacities. And yeah, so somehow, I think it's really important to show this as philosophically rigorous, economically rigorous, So ask me some questions, to answer, and and I think I can answer them ask me for examples, ask me for stories, and maybe suggest some examples and stories because I don't really like the story about the perverse incentives and the women in tech and suddenly seeing a bunch of women in tech. I feel like there's a better way of talking about that that could be, more interesting. Right? So you know, I have some stories for myself, but maybe you can give me some stories to go research and I could go and interview them and talk about them and put them into the book. It doesn't all have to be me. So in for instance, father Greg Boyle is awesome, but that's just the one that I know. And, you know, women in tech as an illustration of tension between metrics and meaning. And I think that there's a lot of great examples of metrics and meaning, but I actually would love your help thinking about a few.EditLet me ask some focused questions to help develop this more rigorous framework:\n\nECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS\nYou mentioned wanting to explore fundamental underpinnings of monetary policy. Can you elaborate on specific mechanisms (beyond M1, M2) where you see the current system creating separation? This could help us build a more technical critique.\nCRAFT AND MASTERY\nThe knife maker example powerfully illustrates how craft creates different economic relationships. Could you share examples from NurCoop or other businesses you know where mastery and direct relationship change:\n\n\nProduction decisions\nPricing structures\nCustomer relationships\nIntergenerational value\n\n\nWISDOM METRICS\nYou mentioned measuring wisdom instead of traditional metrics. What specific aspects of wisdom development have you observed in:\n\n\nYour work with entrepreneurs at Bloom\nYour own business decisions at NurCoop\nOther businesses you admire\n\n\nAUTHENTIC SOCIAL IMPACT\nThe Ahmed story shows a different kind of relationship than traditional \"social impact.\" Could you share other examples where stepping outside the helper/helped dynamic led to unexpected mutual growth?\n\nThese questions aim to build a more rigorous case by:\n\nGrounding philosophical insights in economic mechanisms\nShowing how relationship changes business fundamentals\nDemonstrating practical alternatives to current metrics\nIllustrating authentic impact through real stories\n\nWould you like to explore any of these areas? Or should we first map out the key economic mechanisms you want to critique? CopyRetryBGYeah. And maybe you can also ask me some philosophical questions. So here's the problem. I'm not actually an economics expert, and so I might need to talk to some. And, of course, like, I think maybe my lack of expertise is actually somehow better because I'm not coming at this with a bunch of ideas prefabricated, but I know that we live in a debt based economy Android know that banks can lend 10 times more than the money that they have And I know that the government is constantly trying to stimulate jobs creation, through increasing or decreasing, debt And I know that means that they believe that the system is interoperable and it seems like it's interoperable fundamentally with the strings of economic incentives, by, debt and loans that put people into debt. And the other side of things being taxes. Right? And the wealthy have ways of getting around taxes, and, they probably don't need loans. Then they give loans. And that's why this like, power dynamic is related to how our economy works. And people have, like, these ways that we are manipulated to have eyes bigger than our plates and, like, look to the future and want to be wealthy now. And so buying laptops you can't afford and put it on credit cards and then pay interest. And the fact that interest is just so accepted and it's just like people think of it as if it's just how you do things, and you go and get a mortgage, and you like, this is just How we do things. So we over stretch ourselves in the anticipation that we grow economically into things. And when the world is unstable and we don't know if you know, there'll be, like, a possible tomorrow. Right? Like, their current Fires spreading all across California right now. Disrupting lives. Right? And then It puts people into this position where if they can't work, they have all this debt. They're in big trouble. And, this kind of small ripples of, like, you know, you can think of it like a spring Right? Everyone is, like, pulling themselves out into the future in this anticipation rather than being in the moment. And here's the whole the moments is the only place you can be, the only place you can love. But when you're like, thinking about, okay. I'm gonna make more money in the future if I have this money now and here's a bunch of predictions in a fundamentally unstable world that is becoming increasingly unstabled. Unstable, which means that increasingly debt is gonna be increasingly painful for more people. It's obvious to me. I don't know why people don't see this as obvious. And so that ripple effect is going to ripple Android aggregate create these, you know, synergistic waves that amplify each other, and that's the way that Ray Dalio describes the way the economic machine works. It's just what he sees, and he knows this as a as an investor, as hedge fund fund manager. Right? And so the fact that this is just the way the world works economically, especially with the dollar, and influencing money all over the world because it's the global reserve currency, and the power behind it that is Tied so deeply with other places with money. Right? And it's like, okay, do you have money? Do you have power? No more friends. And if you don't, then we will try to mind you, extract your oil. We will try to do what we can to keep your country unstable so that it's easy for us to get what we need and give you trinkets in the way of, like, I don't know, some kind of trade policy, sell you some weapons for your military, prop up dick dictators, the with you know, it's crazy. It's crazy when you really look into it. It's Saying, but it's strategic, and it makes sense. And there's people definitely thinking about things very deeply Craft and Mastery. Okay. Knife maker example. Yeah. So I love tajjur bakshih. Every single batch he has is numbered. And he is someone that does things with Ihsan the Islamic concept of excellence and perfection and beauty. And there's this idea that is there any reward for Hassan except for Hassan? So the idea is, like, if you put in this perfection, somehow you will be rewarded with perfection and elegance and beauty and this is, his work is in distilling agar wood and he has this meticulousness that I love about him And he is not Claude all over the place. He's a very grounded earthy person. And he's experimenting procedurally, slowly, systematically to try to get the best results And he does things in a beautiful way and I love this guy. And I was wishing that more people would learn from him. There's other people like hyper soak their material to try to get as much extract out of things But the idea of trying to see things as they are in their beauty, their natural beauty, you know, and They, the the wood, you know, and and the soaking creates all of this kind of fermentation process, and it gives people a bigger yield than extract they can sell it for more and it's even stronger in smell, but it smells like an animal farm. But tahtama bakshis are like golden in color. This is Assam Udd. It's very different than everyone else's, and it doesn't have that stinky Anthropic tone and it's because he does things with Hassan and it reduces his yield. It reduces his output. But I think he's not doing it necessarily for the largest yields. He's doing it the people that care. And it might cost a little bit more. But it's better And it's supporting someone with a way of being that I wanna support. And in doing that, it enables his life, and it's like a vote for a world of care and attention to detail and you know, this is why I'm trying to get it into some of the attention language and finding my attentional policies of what I value about this person because I wanna create a world where people are living their meaningful good life and are being rewarded for it and incentivizing that. And then if he's rich, he's able to support the knife maker who's rich, who's able to support the laptop person who's rich. And and and then they can do their craft. And they can find their the thing that is calling to them. And this is why I believe that life is a art form. And, you know, maybe I'm not sure what my art form quite is, yet. Like, I'm working on making perfumes. I love drawing. Love speaking. And you know, I'm sure there's some people that love building organizations. In a in a different way. Like, I have a friend who starts businesses like it's a craft. And the business has a beautiful culture. It's called duo security. Right? It's a security. It's technology company. But the people that went through that process of building this business came out the other side wanting to give back to others because they received so much through the process. And this culture of coaching and improvement and growth and this is such a beautiful thing and I've this guy named Doug Song. Every time I've seen him start he's done started, like, at least 3 through the time I've known him. And sold them. And he does it like it's a day job. He doesn't do it frantically or yelling on top of a TechCrunch stage or whatever. He talks meticulously, slowly, carefully, thoughtfully, about the problem that he's solving. He does it with elegance. He creates value for others. And then he creates amazing like, structures that enable a beautiful culture to allow that value to be defined, marketed, spread, innovated on And And then, like, I don't think when he's building it, he's got this sale dollar signs in his eyes. Like, by the time he started this business, he's already sold 2 before. He's okay financially. But I think he does things in such a beautiful way. And so it can even be a craft to start a business. And I think craft has that idea of like well, there's good ways to do things. And maybe your good ways will look like other people's good ways. Like, there's Steve Jobs and then there's, like, the McDonald's, story. Right? There's Disney and there's other, like, types. Don't be everyone else. B what you are because that's what's gonna be the most interesting, most beautiful, most unique And the thing that will be your like, love to be a part of it will be a part of your mission and your values rather than something that you take away time from your family and your life to, like, hustle money out of people to be able to do something else. And until you find that, keep exploring. You know? And the wisdom metrics Yeah. So wisdom, I really think of as like finding a thing that you don't wanna do anything else instead of. And that's when I think that if I work with other businesses where people not living the good life and have the work be a part of that, then I'm killing that part of the time that they spend doing it. And that's why I feel like my pencil made of plastic in a Chinese factory is full of blood and that's what the BEDACA business tries to compensate for.EditYour insights about debt-based economics and its relationship to presence are profound. Let me ask some philosophical questions to help develop this framework:\n\nPRESENCE AND ECONOMICS\nYou've made a fascinating connection between debt and our inability to be present (\"pulling ourselves into the future\"). Could you explore:\n\n\nHow does ihsan (doing things beautifully for their own sake) offer an alternative economic logic to debt-based growth?\nWhat's the relationship between presence and value creation in Tajul's work versus conventional business?\n\n\nCRAFT AND AUTHENTICITY\nThe contrast between Tajul's meticulous approach and those who \"hyper soak\" for yield illustrates something deeper about authenticity in business:\n\n\nHow does authentic craft naturally limit harmful growth?\nWhat's the relationship between mastery and wisdom in business decisions?\nHow does this connect to your idea that \"life is an art form\"?\n\n\nSYSTEMIC TRANSFORMATION\nYou've described a potential ecosystem where craftspeople support each other. This suggests:\n\n\nHow might networks of craft-based businesses create different economic flows than current systems?\nWhat role does relationship play in this alternative economy?\nHow does this connect to your understanding of baraka?\n\n\nCULTURAL IMPLICATIONS\nThe Duo Security example shows how business culture can nurture growth:\n\n\nWhat's the difference between growth through authentic craft versus growth through debt and extraction?\nHow does this relate to your concept of \"doing things through the business in your life\"?\n\nThese questions aim to help articulate:\n\nThe philosophical foundations of baraka economics\nHow craft and presence create different economic relationships\nThe potential for systemic transformation through authentic business\n\nWould you like to explore any of these areas? We could use your responses to build a more rigorous philosophical framework for the essay.\nAlternative essay structure:\n\"From Debt to Presence: The Economics of Beauty\"\n\nThe Present Moment in Economics\n\n\nHow debt pulls us from presence\nThe relationship between instability and extraction\nWhy current metrics miss what matters\n\n\nCraft as Economic Alternative\n\n\nTajul's story and ihsan\nHow mastery creates different relationships\nNetworks of authentic value\n\n\nWisdom in Business\n\n\nThe role of presence in decision-making\nHow authentic work creates cultures of growth\nMeasuring what truly matters\n\nWould this structure help capture the philosophical rigor you're seeking? CopyRetryBGI think this idea of, like, is almost the opposite of disruption. Right? Like, right now, it's like disrupt this, industry. Find a way of doing it better cheaper, faster, and automate everything that you can. Versus thinking, like, wait a second. What do I actually wanna do with my time? What Claude what kind of business will create a space for more people to live their values in a way that's creating something meaningful and, substantially, you know, solve a real problem in the world rather than create a problem and solve it. Right? So, like, SEO marketing. Right? Like, oh, let's create a I don't know. Like, I'm not actually I don't I think that's a great example, we can find an example where it's like, We build businesses that create problems that then create space for other businesses And instead of being like, do we really need this new thing? Like, what's what's the like, the problem with what we're doing right now with all of the new things is that it's actually doing the opposite of creating more spaces for people to find, fulfilling lives. Like, the whole idea of disruption is, like, automate, simplify, streamline, reduce, and I love technology. Like, I build technology. So I'm not anti technology. I just think that there are certain things that, like, should be foundational to the business that have people in it. That people can see themselves in where they find their sense of self and, meaning and connect and passion and craftsmanship and and it could be writing copy. Right? Android course, we are like, let's automate Android optimize, AV testing we get people that feel like more and more like, dis disgusted by themselves because know, like, you look at someone's Instagram feed and they're like, I didn't look at all those titties. You know? But here are the titties. Why? It's because there it pulls on, like, our weaknesses, and instead, like, write copy That is beautiful. Make images that you'd be proud to see someone looking over on your screen and see as an ad. I I don't have a problem with ads, you know? But, like, what is it gonna be? And Like, what if we found the right things to automate? And kept the things for people that need that that help people find their place. Right? What kind of business infrastructure is there that can support this. Instead, I think Hassan and and automation Hassan's like I wanna start this business. And I want to once to run the business. At some point, someone is gonna have to run the business. Right? Someone's gonna have to make decisions. We can try to give that also over to the machines, but we're gonna have to give an objective function. And right now, we don't know the objective function is besides money, and we know that that's A problem. Right. So what are we gonna do that's different? And Android instead of thinking about that, that's, like, the ultimate end. It's like, okay, we can make businesses that are automatically running and, machines make you run it like you have a bunch of employees that are actually AIs that are interacting with humans and, like, what's the difference? Because these guys are you know, was it even mean using these conscious machines or those conscious machines? These machines are made of meat. Right? And, no, human resources are not human resources. Human resources are human beings that have lives and families and aspirations and desires and attentional policies and and values and sources of meaning that we can attend to or not, and we can have a world that's full of you know, the diverse beautiful craziness of humanity. Or we can have a world that is Flat. I feel like there's also this thing about, like, respect and trust of Learning a craft and having a teacher and, you know, like, if I didn't just run around like a chicken without my head on and tried to build all these businesses and be like, okay, I made a cool technology. Now what can I do with know, Like, now like, Just what if I was more like Doug and I was able to say, okay, you wanna start a business? Well, it's a craft. Everything is a craft. Because life can be a work of art. If that is the constraining frame for our economy, and our schools were actually developing our students in a way where they view themselves As a work of art, a progress, and refinements, what is your unique contribution sincerely rather than saying that with one corner of their mouth and out of the other corner of their mouth, saying, well, here's the options of the machine that you have to fit into to make money for somebody else who are the owners of capital. Like, I think that there's a different way of creating businesses that really, like, the businesses should be owned more by the people working in it. And there's this, company that makes yogurt that shares profit with their employees. And that makes sense. It makes sense that people should have a stake in what they're hands are creating, right? And inspires innovation, inspires people to think about improvements in processes, inspires people to care about their customers when they see a customer buying their thing. You know, of course, it shouldn't be the reason why, they are making their things and, like like, getting excited about it. Like, should first be excited about the fact that get to taste the most amazing yogurt that they were a part of making, and 2, they're making a little bit of money because of that. Every time they see a happy customer, it means they did the right thing for Many reasons. Right? And probably they love the process. They love the fact that they can make a living doing that. I think that's totally fine. Like, we should be making a living doing these things. And so I think there's something really different about like, I'm like, I need your help. Stop asking me questions and start helping me and map this out. Right? What is the current economy like? The forces at play? And what could a different economy be like And, Yeah. How does authentic craft naturally limit harmful growth? Yeah. I mean, there's a There's only so much time in a day. Right? And so we'll probably need to raise prices on many things because the number of hours of people that are gonna go into things are gonna increase and the amount we wanna pay them we want to have a good life And so it means that in order to grow, we'll have to do things differently. Right? So what is growth, really, What is the relationship between mastery and wisdom? In business decisions? Yeah. So, like, I think wisdom is making decisions from a grounded place of Integrity That brings together things that are meaningful for you And even though they're in competition, helps you find a larger frame to hold them within for that decision that is also beautiful and wise and it's, possible to do that, and that is real, I think, leadership and, leadership and I'm not sure how mastery and which and business decisions mastery. Well, you have to master your emotions at least and master this creative process of prioritization and master self knowledge and knowing your values and touching the reality of the moments because, you know, It could be a different set of Creative inspiration that comes to you in the morning if you had to make the decision than in the evening, and that's why it's not just about numbers. The numbers might be the exact Same. Of course, people are like, oh, that's just intuition. We gotta let that go. But I think that there's something that we need to like, confirm that there's Some inner knowledge, some ability to know things that are beyond just our 5 senses, just As was described in the marriage of sense and soul and Ken Wilbur's book that there's like some way that mathematics is known in this way, some truths that we can know philosophically in this way. And there's other things that touch our hearts that we know we love somebody deeply and truly. That is, irrational and super rational and not needing, this type of explanation And it could be some explained phenomena that we can go and do some sort of neurophysiology and say intuition connects the gut brain that we just discovered in the brain brain. And, oh, by the way, there's actually like a skin brain or something that also thinks and it picks things up and don't know. You know, like, we don't know all of those things. And but I do know that we are ignoring this really deep source of actual data and information that needs to be there that machines can never have because they are able to see the numbers, but they're not able to see within the decision maker. And this is why leadership is important. And I know that, you know, I talk about sharing ownership, but I'm not about leaderless organizations. I'm about leaderful organizations and leaderfluid organizations where people with the deepest commitments and the deepest self knowledge and heart opened sense of what the right thing and the most beautiful thing to do is should speak up. Like, what is the most beautiful thing to do in this complicated situation and decision makingEditLet me propose a refined structure that captures these insights more rigorously:\n\"The Art of Business: From Disruption to Cultivation\"\n\nTHE AUTOMATION PARADOX (1.5 pages)\n\n\nCurrent paradigm: \"Disrupt, automate, optimize\"\nHidden costs of efficiency-first thinking\nWhy \"human resources\" aren't resources\nKey Example: Contrast between SEO optimization and authentic copywriting\n\n\nCRAFT AS ECONOMIC FOUNDATION (1.5 pages)\n\n\nBusiness itself as craft (Doug Song example)\nHow mastery creates natural limits\nThe role of teacher-student relationships\nWhy some things shouldn't be automated\n\n\nWISDOM IN DECISION-MAKING (1.5 pages)\n\n\nBeyond metrics: The role of embodied knowledge\nLeadership as aesthetic judgment\nWhy machines can't replace human wisdom\nKey Concept: \"Super-rational\" knowing in business\n\n\nTOWARDS LEADERFUL ORGANIZATIONS (1.5 pages)\n\n\nShared ownership (yogurt company example)\nDifference between leaderless and leaderful\nHow beauty guides complex decisions\nCreating space for authentic contribution\n\nBefore we develop this further, three focused questions:\n\nECONOMIC MECHANICS\nYou've described how debt-based growth differs from craft-based development. Could you elaborate on:\n\n\nWhat specific economic mechanisms would support craft-based businesses?\nHow might pricing and ownership structures change?\nWhat role might alternative currencies or exchange systems play?\n\n\nPRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION\nThe yogurt company example shows one way to share ownership. Could you share:\n\n\nOther concrete examples of businesses structured around craft and wisdom?\nHow they handle growth differently?\nHow they make decisions differently?\n\n\nLEADERSHIP AND BEAUTY\nYou've suggested that beauty can guide complex decisions. Could you describe:\n\n\nA specific difficult decision where beauty provided guidance?\nHow this differs from conventional decision-making?\nWhat practices help leaders develop this capacity?\n\nWould you like to explore any of these areas? Or should we first map the economic mechanisms that would support this alternative vision?\nThe goal would be to show how this isn't just a philosophical critique but a practical alternative to current economic systems. CopyRetryBGYeah. Let's map out the economic mechanisms that support this alternative, vision. And I would like it if, you could help me see the things that I'm not seeing and critique me based on, You know, knowledge that I don't have. Right? Like, what would some really reasonable and appropriate critique be? Android, yeah, let's start with that. And then in the next prompt, I'd like you to answer all the questions that you just asked. About specific economic mechanisms and concrete examples of business, structured on craft and wisdom. And, you know, specific, decision where beauty provided guidance. I mean, there's the story about the The physicist who's, like, know, This has to be a beautiful equation, and so it has to be symmetric and it has to have these sorts of elegant, parts, to it, things that I find aesthetic and, then realizing that yeah, that happens to be also the right answer. And that, like, beauty is a core part of, the way that some people find guidance. And then that there's something here about trusting that beauty actually wins. Right? That you win either way. Like, you work on things in a beautiful way, and then you had the opportunity to work in a beautiful way. And, even if it doesn't work out, like, most businesses don't work out, you had, a beautiful experience. Right? And so, there's there's a success there. And that's how success is every step. But also, if you follow this beautiful way And it finds, like, iOS footing in the world Well, what kind of amazing success is that, that now there's this new approach to doing things that is beautiful that also fits into, the dynamics of the world. Right? And, like, that those are the things that we're looking for. So we need a lot more experiments exploring that rather than a lot more experiments of you know, finding novel technologies that, exploit human foibles and weaknesses to create you know, revenue sources for increasing shareholder value which is like the optimizing function, right? It's Like, okay, use technology to squeeze more out of less and make more money for fewer. And instead, it's like, okay. Well, what if our experiments were like more decisions based on this fundamental self knowledge and perception of meaningful, beautiful, whole actions. And by beauty, I I often can use it synonymously with meaning. Right? When you live meaningful day and you look back, there's that sense of goodness and rightness I'm not gonna try to hypothesize where those things come from, but it's God and spirituality and mysticism and all those other things. Right? But we don't even need to talk about that. We just talk about, like, your perception of beauty being your guide and me, that's what it was. You know, a long time ago, I had this realization that I didn't know if I believed in God But I knew that I could feel a beautiful action versus a non beautiful action. And if I led my life to pursue beauty, well, why would a Justin wonderful, kind, and most merciful god, the merciful god that I know from, Muslim tradition, why would he abandon me? And even I had, like, a direct quote from, the tradition that says, God is beautiful, and he loves that which is beautiful. So if I lived in a beautiful way, I had this kind of Bilal's razor Claude. It's like okay, you live a beautiful life. Great. You live a beautiful life. And if you die and there is no God, that works. And if you die and there is a God, and he is the this Muslim God that promised that he loves beauty, then he'll love me and my life and I'll be okay. Right? And so I kind of use that as my guidance slowly it just became this realization that Islam is real. You know? And I found so much value there And I'm kind of realizing that this same kind of argument could be made for the business like sure, beauty is a good guide, because it's it's right to do the right thing. And the right thing will make your life you'll be proud of what you did even if you failed. And then maybe even if you die, who knows? Like, Sweet. You'll be proud because you the best that you did. And as Oprah Winfrey says, and when you know better, do better. And I think we need, and the world sees that we need another model. Right? And we're gonna have to go through a transitory period where we're like in this, world of know, American hegemony and power and the dollar and debt and not everyone's gonna be like, oh, debt is forbidden. Let's not have this debt based economy. Know, eat the rich, destroy, like there should be no billionaires tax them down to 0, like that's that's I don't believe in that kind of transition, but I believe that we can find little experiments in people starting businesses based on their perception of like the right and beautiful thing, this is gonna attract people. People are talking about HR problems and resources, and then there's so many people around the world that are just fed up with the way that things are working, and they want all alternatives, but they can't find it. And so wanna tear the system down but if it'll work, You know, another way. We're like, holy crap. Like, it's more expensive, but my kids can have it. What does that mean? What does that imply? I know there's this book called Capital. It came out recently. Talking all about how important inheritance was. Right? Imagine, like, you have knives from your great grandparents. Like, we could. Right? What happened to them? I don't know. People got so excited about the future and plastics and microwaves and you know, throwing away our parents and disrupting tradition and throwing it all away to be free and all of this stuff. And then we find ourselves, like, trapped in a world where you know, it's even hard to know that we're trapped because we don't have the space. So many people are tired. They come home. Don't even have time to be with themselves, let alone their kids, let alone their thoughts, let alone wonder if there's another way of doing things. Thank god I've been ridiculous in my life, and I've lived an insane way. And I've had the ability to kind of experiment and and and and ask these weird questions and try these weird businesses. But now, like, I think there's I want more people on that adventure. And I think that there's enough pain and enough suffering and enough of a realization that it's time to try some other way You know, And there's the brakes coming up, but, like, what are they gonna do? The same but different? The same but Brazil? The same but Russia? What what's different about this experiment? And I think that Turkey can be, you know, showing some real leadership as an Islamic country. Think about, what does it mean if we take Islamic principles seriously? Economics, you know? And some of that is about debt, some of that is about what exactly is money. Some of that is the fundamental knowledge that money is kinda your livelihood is guaranteed. Right? And that charity comes back. And that Hassan and excellence is returned with excellence. And that your life is meaningful you know, and has a purpose. And you're not just supposed to go trade your time in a company to try to scrape about a couple of hours. You can have a little bit of fun on the weekends and have a house that you have to maintain and a car that you have to pay the lease on and kids that are gonna go off to college and a savings fund. So that you can do what? You know? Where is the meaning in all of this? Where is the purpose in all of this? And I think there's something there that we need to really think about And, can you, like, look through all of the different arguments and comp, like, components of theories and questions that we have and places where people might like antagonize or critique us And like, what things do you think has never been said before? And what things do you think are just like common knowledge and like hippie fluff that is already out there? Make a list of all the the core concepts and the core, arguments and the core, like, way that we're seeing systems and models and that we need to change our way of Seeing and our way of being and that that will fundamentally result in the emergence of new systems and, like, the position of beauty and meaning and values and all of this and, yeah, kind of like the core gaps and once you have all of those, let's find where the gaps are.EditCORE CONCEPTS & ARGUMENTS:\n\nNovel/Distinctive Ideas:\n\n\nBeauty as economic compass (beyond mere aesthetics)\n\"Bilal's Razor\" - beauty as practical and spiritual guide\nSuccess redefined as \"beautiful process\" regardless of outcome\nDistinction between leaderless and \"leaderful\" organizations\nCraft-based growth as natural limiter\nConnection between debt and inability to be present\n\n\nCommon/Existing Ideas:\n\n\nCritique of shareholder capitalism\nWorker ownership models\nAnti-automation sentiment\nValues-based business\nSpiritual economics\nSustainable/slow growth\n\nPOTENTIAL CRITIQUES:\n\nEconomic:\n\n\nHow does this system handle capital formation?\nWhat about industries requiring massive infrastructure?\nHow to compete with efficiency-driven competitors?\nScale limitations in global economy\n\n\nPractical:\n\n\nHigher prices limiting access to goods\nPotential for craft elitism\nTime intensity of craft-based production\nEconomic transition mechanisms\n\n\nPhilosophical:\n\n\nSubjectivity of beauty\nCultural relativism in values\nTension between tradition and innovation\nRole of technology\n\nKEY GAPS TO ADDRESS:\n\nEconomic Mechanisms:\n\n\nSpecific alternatives to debt-based growth\nConcrete pricing models\nDistribution systems\nInvestment structures\n\n\nTransition Strategy:\n\n\nHow to move from current to proposed system\nRole of policy/regulation\nMarket mechanisms\nEducational requirements\n\n\nScale Questions:\n\n\nHow to handle essential mass production\nGlobal trade implications\nTechnology integration\nResource allocation\n\n\nMeasurement Framework:\n\n\nBeyond profit metrics\nBeauty/wisdom indicators\nSuccess measures\nSystem health metrics\n\nUNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS:\n\nIntegration Framework:\n\n\nConnecting presence, beauty, and economics\nLinking craft to natural limits\nBeauty as practical decision guide\nSuccess as process quality\n\n\nAlternative Growth Model:\n\n\nGrowth through depth not scale\nQuality-based expansion\nRelationship-centered commerce\nWisdom-driven innovation\n\n\nLeadership Paradigm:\n\n\n\"Leaderful\" vs leaderless\nBeauty-guided decision making\nCraft mastery in management\nValues-based authority\n\nCRITICAL QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n\nEconomic Design\n\n\nWhat specific mechanisms enable beauty-driven decisions?\nHow do we price relationship value?\nWhat replaces debt as growth driver?\n\n\nSystem Integration\n\n\nHow does this connect to existing institutions?\nWhat role for government/policy?\nInterface with global trade?\n\n\nPractical Implementation\n\n\nTraining/education requirements?\nTechnology integration principles?\nTransition strategies?\n\nWould you like to:\n\nDevelop specific mechanisms for any of these gaps?\nExplore how to address key critiques?\nDetail concrete examples of these principles in action?\n\nThis analysis suggests your framework offers unique insights in connecting beauty, presence, and economics, but needs development in specific implementation mechanisms and transition strategies. Where would you like to focus next? CopyRetryBGYeah. These sound like really, interesting unique ideas, except I see beauty as kind of like a byproduct of being able to have access to your, sources of meaning and that beauty is the experience of living your sources of meaning at work and you could call it like living your values And so I see it as sort of similar to this idea of, like, values based businesses, but I'm wondering what's the unique take that my version has on it. It, like, focuses on trusting nonquantifiable things, looking at Things from advantage points of interconnection and wondering what is you know, the most meaningful way Most in my language, the most meaningful way is also the most values aligned way To Address questions about how to do stuff, how to run a business, how to be a leader in the business. That beauty happens to be often a good kind of shorthand for that process of like seeking beauty. Right? And but I'm really talking about meaning and values. I'm not talking about aesthetics. And so is there anything different about what I'm saying and what people call values based business? Let's, like, take that down. Yeah. And so, like, what do you think about the beautiful process regardless of outcome? As an experimental transition as we move towards a new economy? Like, is that an interesting idea? Yeah. And I see how these are common ideas. How does how can my critique come from the unique ideas to enhance or make more strong, the argument inside of the, common existing ideas. And I need your help answering these questions. How does the system handle industries requiring massive infrastructure? I don't know. How to compete with efficiency driven competitors. I'm not sure. But what I think you could do is come up with the constitutive attentional policies that I've been forming all along the way. Basically, the things that I attend to when I'm making a meaningful choice, the things that I would do as ends in of themselves and come up with a list of the constitutive attentional policies. You can look up Joe Edelman's work at meaningalignment.org. To find that and, you you know, it would be something like moments where Beauty emerges from Context set up intentionally. Right? Something like that. Yeah. And higher prices limiting access to goods, but the people that are accessing those goods are getting getting paid more because they're getting they're doing different work. Right? So craft elitism, Yeah. Besides craft, what else? Can you help me, look through these? And what do you think about Yeah. How does it connect to in existing institutions, role of government and policy, interfere with global Claude, Isn't that a good thing? Yeah. What specific mechanisms in enable beauty driven decisions? I think really getting more clear about what's meaningful for us and, the lives that we wanna live and what the good life is. And just asking, like, these deeper more important questions than GDP or immigrants or whatever it is. Right? It's getting to the deeper core of things and that requires people to have time and space and we could have used the pandemic to look into that. Yeah. Growth through depth and not scale. I like that. But, like, what are the consequences of my ideas? I'm not talking about not starting scalable businesses. Doug Song sold Duo Security for 2 point $5,000,000,000 to Cisco. Right? At some point, Like, your value and your, like, products and services can be very valuable, and maybe even meaningful throughout the entire business. And it could use automation I'm not, like, totally against automation, I'm just automating the right things, measuring the right things, and creating a place where everybody that interfaces in the business and everybody that buys from the business and everybody in the value chain of a business, can live their meaningful lives rather than feeling like trading their time for money. And then that money is not real money. It's debt. Right? That people are borrowing and just creating these, like, sloshing back and forth You know, constructive interference. And so what if there's, like, a different way of doing things? And it's not about not automating. It's measuring and automating the right things and leaving places not leaving places, but knowing that it's a crime you know. In in Ottoman era, they they they didn't actually allow printing press for a while because they had thousands of scribes with a beautiful art form that they wanted to protect. And that kind of thing could be stuff that we do because because these things are inherently meaningful and beautiful and like a handwritten letter. When was the last time you got a handwritten letter? I tried my best to write by hand poems to my wife and give it to her in envelopes and, like, They're around. They go and they get onto the mirror and I hope they're in a box someday for my son to find, you know. In a 100 years or something. I don't know. Like, 50 years from now, like, I think there are some things that are not that that we should do because they're meaningful, not and and that we should not do because they they interfere with our ability to touch meaning. And if you wanna talk about, like, a society of healthy people that don't need to go to you know, the the hospital so much where there's less crime and less policing and less you know, like, Claude and less like, chasing and, like, like, look, I don't I don't you know what you're like people talk about inner cities. It's like hard knock life. Yeah. It's a hustle, and it's crazy. And it's because of what it is. You know? Like, I think that imagine, like, far fewer hospital trips, people leading meaningful lives, stress levels reduced. How Much of our hospital expenditure and insurance payments are going to the stresses induced by businesses on their employees or, like, this idea of making a living. Even if it's like a couple of cortisol levels above their normal baseline. Right? If they were on a 3 day weekend. Even if it's just that, Like, that in aggregate, en masse, is creating heart attacks, is creating all sorts of things, That we could quantify if we wanted. But instead, like imagine a good life where people not only are working, but they also realize that their body is one of the things that they value and has a right upon them. And they have to balance these competing values. And if they do that, with wisdom, they find a beautiful way of like okay. How about we do walking interviews at work where I get some extra because I care about my body and I really need to do this because I really care about my work. And this way of thinking about creating wise actions, I think, it iOS ripple effects can have massive economic implications From Many, many different sectors of society. Right? Like, how much money do you need? When people are content with what they have? And are leading healthy whole lives supporting each other and their neighbors. Like, how much less money are we gonna need for international developments, for our armies, for our wars, For our you know, social services and, for our policing and for like, literally, we're chasing our tail all around the block because we set up a situation where because of this lack of purpose and meaning, and just like postmodern condition, we're creating insanity that we then have to try to create systems to protect rather than helping people realize that they have hearts and lives and their whole And that if you have this desire to make something or to create a business or to Do something and you think that it's a beautiful thing to add to the world That you'd be proud to have this be your way of showing up every day and not just, like, automating a bunch of stuff so you can make money you can blah blah blah. Like, maybe before you start a business, there had to be a deep interrogation about your why. Right. And if you have a strong enough why, you'll un overcome anyhow, and you should definitely do the business. Right? And if your why also resonates with more people, it means that you can find your employees clamoring to work with you. Right? Especially if you built something amazing. And it could be a software. It could be an automation. It could be a machine. But it better be beautiful. And beauty is connected to your values and your sources of meaning. And all of that's connected to you attend to, what you can attend to, Are you attending to numbers? Or are you attending to your relationships? Spaces. People. Interactions. Are you just looking at a screen? Or at your bank account?EditKEY DIFFERENTIATORS FROM \"VALUES-BASED BUSINESS\":\n\nDepth of Integration\n\n\nNot just having values, but attending to meaning-making\nValues emerge from presence rather than being imposed\nFocus on process quality regardless of outcome\nIntegration of personal wholeness with business function\n\n\nAttention Framework\nLet me map some Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs) from your approach:\n\n\"Wholeness Recognition\"\nCAP: Noticing opportunities for integration of competing values\nAP: When facing decisions, attend to:\n\nHow does this serve multiple values simultaneously?\nWhere are artificial separations creating problems?\nWhat wisdom emerges from holding tensions?\n\n\"Meaningful Process\"\nCAP: Valuing beauty of process independent of outcome\nAP: Notice:\n\nQuality of presence in each action\nOpportunities for craft in seemingly routine tasks\nWhere automation serves/disrupts meaning\n\n\"Relationship Intelligence\"\nCAP: Seeing business as web of meaningful connections\nAP: Attend to:\n\nHow decisions affect whole system of relationships\nWhere meaning emerges in interactions\nOpportunities for deeper connection\n\nUNIQUE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS:\n\nPreventive Economics\n\n\nReduced healthcare costs through meaningful work\nLower social service needs through community connection\nDecreased enforcement costs through purpose-driven lives\n\n\nAlternative Growth Model\n\n\nGrowth through depth of meaning rather than scale alone\nValue creation through relationship quality\nInnovation driven by wisdom rather than disruption\n\n\nInfrastructure Question\nYour approach suggests:\n\n\nNot anti-scale but different criteria for scaling\nTechnology serving meaning rather than replacing it\nDuo Security example: possible to scale meaningfully\n\nCRITICAL INSIGHTS:\n\nThe Debt-Meaning Connection\n\n\nDebt pulls us from presence\nCurrent system creates artificial scarcity\nAlternative: meaning-based value creation\n\n\nBeyond Standard Critiques\n\n\nNot just about worker ownership or anti-automation\nAbout fundamental attention patterns\nQuestions what we optimize for\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop more specific CAPs from your examples?\nExplore how these principles could address specific economic challenges?\nMap out transition strategies based on this framework?\n\nYour framework suggests that economic transformation requires changing not just structures but attention patterns. This is more fundamental than typical values-based business approaches. Should we focus on developing this distinction further? CopyRetryBG Yeah. Let's do 2 and focus on that in-depth And then also start to think of, like, what happens when you know, Education and globalization, internationalization, touches these things. It's like Local and global, we have these tools. But we're coming back to craft. And you're right about the question of these, like, big industrial processes. So what are these balances? I'd really like to dig deeply into these and to think of, like, what if 3 m hired me as a consultant transform them into a beautiful business? Is it even possible? What would it look like? And what are the you know, impact for investors in 3 m and dividends which I like, actually. I really like the idea of dividends. I don't like the idea of speculation. Yeah. What do you think is The impact of that, and especially, I I didn't really deeply think about Globalization and international trade and you know, basically, Fukuyama thinking like, okay. Well, Australia makes eucalyptus trees, so the rest of the world is gonna toilet paper, and they should hyperfocus on what makes them uniquely beneficial and with their ecology and landscape produces and, you know, like Iraq is just oil. Australia is, eucalyptus, and America is deehaw, bluejeans, and capitalism or something, dollars. Like, what about what is a different sort of globalization where There's actually a different world when you travel somewhere. Like, right now, if you travel anywhere in Europe, there's McDonald's everywhere. There is carpool everywhere. There's stuff everywhere. And it's great because it's familiar, but it's you know, know? It's like, okay. Well, I'm in Dubai now. So what? I'm driving in a Mercedes. I'm in whatever now, but, like, we have the Mercedes of Iraq. Like, are there like, could that be a craft? Is it possible? But could we even have car companies that are craft oriented that are relatively affordable, that you know, smaller teams can each work on individual parts, and then who would mark Who would, like, convince the world to buy? And how do we transition? So I'm really interested in the globalization impact, especially with considering the population dynamics and shifts in the world and, like, as education also connects us because there is going to be more and more, I think, large language model driven exploration based, education and technology based education that's going to potentially have the opportunity of connecting more people with meaning And is it true that if everyone kind of You know, Plato, Golden Mean, everyone does exactly the right thing. Everything fits in harmoniously in this solid structure like an atom. Forming a crystal, and all is hunky dory. Right. Like, will everybody wanna be an artist because of influence from outside. And, like, what are the right influences to pay attention to and like, my brother really loves plants and gardening. Like, he always said, like, where am I supposed to be, a farmer? Because in my culture, like, you either become a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer. And Iraqi like, 6 and that's what success is. And so success is defined for so many people by the movies, and we have so much momentum as culture and ideas and pressure and parents telling us what makes money and what will keep us safe and generations of this ever since, like, industrialization and kind of this dream, this captivated dream that the non aristocracy, non wealth holders are under this assumption. And then the elites have their private schools and their ski trips and their hobbies and their archery and horse riding, and they're they actually get embodied, which is what the doing. And, like, then there's, like, the the screw turners, the the the hole punchers. In a factory is doing repetitive, like, tedious jobs. Using their bodies, but injuring them at the same time. And there's a different way. And everyone sees this, but no one's I hear this Claude, like, Irritation and, like, I can't stand it anymore. Give me a book that is letterpress. Give me A Painting that was done by hand. Don't go to IKEA and buy some, like, gloss, glucy, printing, whatever fancy that makes it look like a painting thing from afar, but you go up close and you realize it's lifeless, you know. And Can we ask for a world that's more. Right? And then just like that means there's gonna be more room for more people to do more things. But what about the big things? Like, who's gonna mass produce the aluminum cap for my lampshade. Right? Like, Am I always gonna have to buy something that is Android or more just to have everything in my life Android being crafted. And like that plastic air filter. There's so many different pieces in there. And the mic and the micron level filter paper How do we do that? By hand? Can we or should we? And what does it mean about globalization and how things can interconnect and supply chains. And what if yeah, we only build things within a 100 mile radius? So change drastically what we can build and maybe limit us in many ways. Is that the Claude, or is there something there we can do that's beautiful about international trade? I mean, Nordica Creates Studios gets its supplies from around the world. Picks it up by hand, flies it in his carry on back home.EditECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION FRAMEWORK:\n\nLAYERED PRODUCTION ECOLOGY\n\nLocal Craft Layer:\n\nHandmade goods where relationship matters\nDirect producer-consumer connection\nHigher prices, deeper meaning\nExample: Letterpress books, handmade knives\n\nRegional Manufacturing Layer:\n\nSemi-automated, human-centered production\nWorker ownership and craft principles\nBalance between efficiency and meaning\nExample: Potential \"Iraqi Mercedes\" - regional car manufacturing with cultural identity\n\nGlobal Infrastructure Layer:\n\nEssential mass production (filters, components)\nReimagined through meaning lens\nFocus on worker dignity and environmental harmony\nExample: 3M transformation possibility\n\n\n3M TRANSFORMATION CASE STUDY\n\nCurrent State:\n\nGlobal supply chains\nEfficiency-driven production\nShareholder value focus\n\nPotential Beautiful Business Transformation:\na) Production Units\n\nSmaller, more autonomous teams\nCraft principles in R&D\nWorker involvement in innovation\n\nb) Organizational Structure\n\nRegional production hubs\nLocal material sourcing where possible\nCultural adaptation of products\n\nc) Financial Model\n\nEmphasis on dividends over speculation\nLong-term stakeholder value\nInvestment in worker development\n\nd) Innovation Process\n\nBeauty-driven product development\nEnvironmental integration\nCultural wisdom incorporation\n\n\nGLOBALIZATION REIMAGINED\n\nFrom Homogenization to Diversity:\n\nCultural distinctiveness as value\nRegional craft traditions\nLocal material wisdom\n\nTrade Principles:\n\nExchange of excellence rather than efficiency\nCultural cross-pollination\nKnowledge sharing networks\n\nSupply Chain Revolution:\n\nMixed model: craft + infrastructure\nTransparent relationship networks\nTechnology serving connection\n\n\nTRANSITION STRATEGIES\n\nEducational:\n\nCraft apprenticeships\nTechnical-cultural integration\nValues-based business education\n\nEconomic:\n\nRegional manufacturing initiatives\nCraft-scale financing\nAlternative success metrics\n\nCultural:\n\nRedefining success beyond professions\nCelebrating regional distinctiveness\nSupporting meaningful work\n\nCRITICAL QUESTIONS:\n\nEconomic Balance\n\n\nHow to price essential goods affordably while honoring craft?\nWhat determines appropriate scale for different products?\nHow to maintain quality with distributed production?\n\n\nGlobal Integration\n\n\nRole of technology in connecting craft networks\nBalance between local distinctiveness and global standards\nHow to preserve cultural wisdom while enabling exchange\n\n\nInfrastructure Challenge\n\n\nWhat stays mass-produced?\nHow to bring meaning to essential manufacturing?\nRole of automation in beautiful business\n\nWould you like to:\n\nExplore any of these areas in more detail?\nDevelop specific strategies for 3M transformation?\nExamine how education could support this transition?\n\nThis framework suggests that beautiful business isn't about rejecting scale but about finding the right scale for meaning at each level of production.

Decision making, all that sharing. But will we be able to build the lateral arch hater hadron collider? What things are okay to make efficient? What should be optimized? If anything. Right. There's a story of Rumi you know, making, His was making his soup and instead of just, like, whisking away as fast as possible trying to be efficient, he was tracing out the names of god onto the bottom of the pot. And how we get a roomie. Right. And then there's another story of a mystic who was at someone's house and they were making a soup as well.

And then you know, we don't have to really consider what it's like for everyone else, but, like, that presence is leaves a residue, at least in the Muslim tradition, these prayers matter.

This is how I think of meaning, things we do for their sake that we find meaningful in and of themselves : You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.Your dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:Start with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\nZoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\nAsk questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\nWhen you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\nCall submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:DO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\nDON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\nDON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\nDO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\nDON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\nNEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policiesA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.A source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.){ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }Zooming in on sources of meaning:If the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.Zoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.Zooming from goalsA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.So, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.Zooming from feelingsFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.When the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\nSince negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectationsA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".You can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?Gathering the user's source of meaning:Ask about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\nAsk about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\nGather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\nEnsure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\nMake sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policiesStart with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\nWrite from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\nUse general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\nBe precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningfulEditLet me start by asking about a specific experience: Can you tell me about a time when you felt deeply connected to something you were making or producing, even though it involved some automated or mechanical processes? This could be from NurCoop or another context.\nThis will help us understand:\n\nWhere automation serves meaning\nHow presence can be maintained in production\n\nThen we can develop the values cards to guide decisions about automation and presence in manufacturing.\nWould you like to share such an experience? I'm particularly interested in moments where technology or automation actually supported rather than detracted from meaning. CopyRetryBGYeah. When I was a kid, I remember configuring a bunch of string and straws and pulleys to be able to sit in my bunk bed on one side of the room. Pull a string and have it go through all of these things to pull a light switch on the other side of the room. And I made it so you can, like, turn it on and off pulling either one string or another. And I think because, like, the time I took to make it was probably worth the like, dozens and dozens of getting out of the bed, going and turning off the light and coming back up into the bed, but ingenuity and creativity and thoughtfulness and the fact that it worked and was really exciting. And That's an interesting child like automation. You know? Like, it shows my penchant for Creativity and innovation and automation never started really young. I remember I always thought about, like, oh, how could I have, a computer that could also be a Nintendo that could be a Super Nintendo that you can push a button and you can turn into anything you want. And I'd be make made out of liquid metal so I can transform myself and I had all these kinds of weird ideas. And, as an adult, something that I automated that was meaningful Yeah. I used the large language models to help me automatically creates different Python scripts. Like, I could have written those myself and thought about them and went to a professor, but because of the dynamism and the back and forth and and thinking conceptually, I was able to kind of, like, iterate and come up with more and more interesting questions to talk about the research data that I collected in 5 years ago in 2020 when the Beirut blast happened, I collected research on post traumatic growth factors and social And I remember Just being Like, excited and in a process of, like, discovery and curiosity And I wasn't writing the code. It was all automated through the LLM, but I was still really engaged in the process of you know, figuring out what's meaningful here. And presence can be maintained in production You know, part of this makes me think, like, the the some of these things should be just completely automated. Right? Some of the things that are like Entirely just there because of dexterity of a person that we should change the way that we do assembly lines entirely. Right? Like, what if we took Rumi's chef and his perspective. And that, like, every bolt is screwed on by someone in presence. Will the car make feel any different to drive? Right? Versus, like, robots that make shapes that are completely impossible to do by hand because you can hold 18 different points at the same time and I'm not sure. This is something I really like somehow thinking through.EditThat light switch story is really telling - the automation wasn't about efficiency at all, was it? It was about creating something clever, something that expressed your creativity. And with the LLM research analysis, it seems like automation freed you to engage with deeper questions.\nLet me ask about that research analysis experience: When you were working with the LLM to analyze the post-traumatic growth data, what specifically felt meaningful about that process? Was it the questions you could ask, the patterns you could discover, or something else?\nAlso, you've raised a fascinating question about assembly lines and Rumi's approach. When you think about what makes production meaningful, is it more about the state of mind of the maker, or about creating something that couldn't exist without that particular combination of human and machine?\nThese questions will help us craft values cards about meaningful automation and presence in production. CopyRetryBGWhat felt meaningful is that I wasn't stuck in where I like, the code and trying to figure stuff out you know, like syntax and, like, how do you do that again? And, like, what are the different types of analysis possible? And It it could actually just let me be curious and ask it to look at different angles and, you know, use what I'm really good at, which thinking expansively and critically and asking pointed questions about what diverse types of people would say about it. And know, like, I feel like engaging with an LLM allows me to be creative with the stuff of thought rather than the stuff of code. And some people out there love code. I know. I'm I'm friends with them. They're just they could write this Claude, and doesn't hold them back. And they can do both. And that's beautiful, but that's not me. I'm actually more interested in the, idea space rather than in the creation space. And other people are interested in the creation of of code. So and the elegance and the beauty of a well written code. What makes the production meaningful? Yeah. Definitely. It's connected to the state of mind of the maker. Connecting it with intention, Process, presence, connecting to the moment, Using it as opportunities for 2 for 1 specials. So I often connect My manual work with, listening to a book or contemplating, you know, like, you can get into a rhythm, so I I package a lot of the oils, and I just listen to books or call my friends and know, your mind doesn't really need to be that presence in the physical part and the physical part can become kind of like a meditation or like a rhythm But, yeah. This is just for me. Of course, I don't I used to have a screen printing company. There's a lot of manual stuff there. And actually, there's something really enjoyable. Say it's a 4 color print. You turn the tables. The first one goes down. Second one goes down. 3rd one goes down. Then the last one is, like, the outline. You know? So each one was, like, a block of color and the last one's an outline. And just, like, doing it, it's really satisfying when it comes out right. And, of course, it might come out wrong. You have to tweak it. You have to get it just right. And so there's, like, skill and precision and getting it, the exposures to be clean and the you know, the alignment's registered. And once it's there and you locked it in, it's actually really cool. And, you know, I I don't think I ever got bored of that. That moment of, like, pop. Yes. You know? Where just is all set up. And there's a lot of, you know, initial work and creativity and manual, like, blowing out the screens and exposing the drawing exposing, and washing, and registering and getting the shirts and getting the job itself and all of this stuff to lead up to that moment, and then then you just have to do it over and over and over and over. Because you have to Prince. 500 shirts. Alright. And also what was meaningful about that kind of stuff was, like, when I had a Android shirt order, that was amazing. I did it for Townley Hall. And it was a really cool drawing on a gray shirt. Line, very fine. I loved fine drawings. And using the yellow mesh and it was a little bit more finicky than the, you know, coarser mesh, but we we got it right. And then I just realized, like, how much money it would make us And that was really exciting too. So there definitely was in financial element you know, seeing this, realizing what we're doing, the beauty, the elegance, and, like, the possibility that the money affords to try new stuff. Like, I explored all sorts of creative shirts that actually had phosphorescent ink Claude you know, we can get new equipments and new machines, or we can hire somebody. Like, if the business act It works. Like, he could do so many other interesting things too. And so that possibility space with the bigger jobs was also very exciting because it meant possibility. And the community and new people working with us and new tools to allow new stuff to happen. So I think maybe that's an interesting story too.EditLet me reflect back what I'm hearing about meaningful production and automation, then propose some values cards:\nFor the first card about creative automation:\n{ \"attention_policies\": [\n\"MOMENTS where tools free the mind for deeper exploration\",\n\"OPPORTUNITIES to expand thought beyond technical constraints\",\n\"RHYTHMS that allow simultaneous contemplation and action\",\n\"POSSIBILITIES that emerge when basic tasks are handled\"\n] }\nDoes this capture how you think about meaningful automation? The focus seems to be on how automation creates space for different kinds of engagement.\nFor production processes, based on your screen printing story:\n{ \"attention_policies\": [\n\"SATISFACTIONS that come from precise execution\",\n\"POTENTIALS that open up when craft succeeds financially\",\n\"RHYTHMS where repetition becomes meditation\",\n\"MOMENTS of perfect alignment between intention and result\"\n] }\nWould you like to refine either of these? I notice there's something about the relationship between technical mastery and possibility space that might need more exploration.\nAlso, I'm curious - when you think about applying these to larger-scale production, what aspects feel most important to preserve? Is it the rhythm, the possibility space, or something else? CopyRetryBGYeah. I think in in larger scale production, I There might be something about the satisfaction from Precisex something but I think people have to be involved in more parts. Right? They're not just the the screw turner. They they somehow designed the car themselves. Right. And then they get to see their designs 3 d printed or something, and then they use that to make a mold. And they actually are using their hands Android their bodies and they're feeling it and they're there. And actually, it would probably lead to better results. You know, instead of production failures coming from, lack of understanding of the designer and what is possible technically with the production and know, if it's more in the hands of a single person, I think there's some more beauty and meaning that can arise. But when it's like here's a thing somebody else made to make somebody else money that you need to push a button and make the robot doesn't kill anybody kind of automation is not the way that should go. Can you pull out, like, some insights from here that you think can, yeah, improve our larger argument and, you know, compile a list of arguments and points and concepts that we want to share, and then about the arguments as logical diagrams and find any points of, like, that need to be improved that have like, logical inconsistencies you know, maybe we don't need to promise the world. Maybe we're not gonna change the global, economy, but maybe we create, like, a parallel economy. Of meaning that Has a place to grow and Kind of like a a red pill exit the system space that is actually viable. And has, Claude where people can invest and get sustainable returns and beautifying things rather than you know, random investments.EditCORE ARGUMENT STRUCTURE:\n\nTHE PROBLEM\nCurrent State:\n\n\nFragmented production (design separate from execution)\nWorker alienation from end product\nFinancial returns prioritized over meaning\nDebt-based growth driving unsustainable practices\n\n\nTHE ALTERNATIVE VISION\nBeautiful Business Framework:\n\n\nIntegration of conception and execution\nDirect relationship with materials and processes\nMeaningful automation serving human potential\nReturn on relationship alongside financial return\n\n\nLOGICAL FLOW:\n\nPremise A: Current economic system creates:\n→ Separation from meaning\n→ Environmental degradation\n→ Social alienation\n→ Unsustainable growth\nPremise B: Beautiful business enables:\n→ Integration of work and meaning\n→ Environmental harmony\n→ Social connection\n→ Sustainable development\nGAPS/POTENTIAL WEAKNESSES:\n\nScale Question\nCurrent Argument: Integration of conception/execution\nGap: How to handle complex products requiring diverse expertise\nPotential Solution: New organizational structures enabling meaningful collaboration\nFinancial Viability\nCurrent Argument: Sustainable returns through beauty\nGap: Concrete mechanisms for investor returns\nNeed: Specific financial models and examples\nTransition Mechanism\nCurrent Argument: Parallel economy of meaning\nGap: How to interface with existing system\nNeed: Practical transition strategies\nTechnology Integration\nCurrent Argument: Automation serving meaning\nGap: Specific guidelines for appropriate automation\nNeed: Framework for technology decisions\n\nSTRENGTHENED FRAMEWORK:\nInstead of promising global transformation, focus on:\n\nParallel Economy Development\n\n\nNetwork of beautiful businesses\nAlternative investment vehicles\nSustainable return mechanisms\nCommunity support structures\n\n\nPractical Implementation\n\n\nStart with sectors amenable to integration\nBuild demonstrable success cases\nCreate supporting infrastructure\nDevelop educational pathways\n\n\nClear Value Proposition\nFor Workers:\n\n\nMeaningful engagement\nSkill development\nDirect relationship to product\nFair compensation\n\nFor Investors:\n\nSustainable returns\nRisk mitigation through relationship\nLong-term value creation\nSocial/environmental benefits\n\nFor Consumers:\n\nHigher quality products\nTransparent relationships\nCultural connection\nLasting value\n\nWould you like to:\n\nDevelop any of these areas further?\nExplore specific implementation strategies?\nAddress particular logical gaps?\n\nThis framework suggests focusing on building a viable parallel system rather than transforming the entire economy. We can start with sectors where meaning and integration are most critical, then expand based on demonstrated success. CopyRetryBGIs relationship really the core at the end? Like, Integration of work and meaning, environmental harmony, social connection, And then it's a single development. Is that really what we're leaning towards? So I mean, part of it part of the whole idea is that that's like a accidental byproduct. Like, you know, Warm is happening when you're using your muscles. Like, it just happens not the goal. The goal is to Go for a run, and the warmth is the byproduct. I'm really interested in if you can also give me, like, some detailed ideas of investors, like, how could we share this idea? With them? And, what sectors you think are the most amenable to integration? And what are the logical gaps that we have? Scale. Yeah. New organizational structures. They already exist. Financial viability, Sustainable returns to beauty. Yeah. Let's think about those specific financial models. That's what I was asking for. It's not about interfacing with existing system. It's about creating a parallel one that has its own sort of funds slashing around between people in more crafty more human humane businesses buying and shopping from with each other. Like, I remember when I was in the screen printing business, I'd go to trade shows all the expensive stuff. You know? Like, we couldn't afford it, but we could trade. And that was always really amazing. At the end, you'd get really cool stuff, because people like your really cool stuff. And They valued them for the more expensive thing, but don't have the cash necessary to buy the really expensive stuff, but trading was just fine. And so either trading or cash. Think it works. Yeah.

CopyRetryBGHere’s some content I wrote a few years ago when I was still focused on the idea of social impact, might be interesting to review and loop into our ideas, do we have a framework? These days I've been writing haiku, so let's start with one:\nTo connect people\nTo themselves and each other\nMake tomorrow newThis is really at the essence of what I find beautiful in my work to cultivate social entrepreneurship in the Middle East. I am inspired by that contributions of people who are often neglected in the conversation about our collective future. From people in Baghdad, where my family is from, to people in Tarfaya, a tiny village in Morocco, I work and am working to build community around the ideas of co-creation, creativity and contribution. I believe that we, at our core, are beautiful, cooperative, compassionate, creative, and that as more people leave their counties, the more likely that country is to suffer. As climate change, political conflict, and lack of employment creates turmoil in the Middle East, I believe it's more important than ever to build bridges between people, resources, mentors, to unlock participation.\\\nTitle: All together now\nWhat if it was true,\nthat anyone with a dream\ncould also build itMy work is aimed at most directly impacting youth in conflict/crisis areas, specifically the Middle East.I am most known for helping kickstart the hackerspace movement in the Middle East. My kickstarter gained a bit of attention and like a salmon swimming up stream I went to places people were fleeing to talk about building community spaces where we could co-construct our future. I I am most known for helping kickstart the hackerspace movement in the Middle East. My kickstarter fundraiser gained a bit of attention and I supported building physical community spaces where we could co-construct our future. I was able to build a prosthetic socket for my cousin's amputated leg with the 3D printer I brought to the hackerspace community in Baghdad. To me, my crowning achievement in all this is that I am now a member of a group of Iraqis who are researching and building scholarship programs for women desiring to study abroad in Iraq. It's important to me because I had nothing to do in putting it together and I feel carried by our collective effort to make beautiful things happen in Iraq. 2020 Compassionate Leadership Fellow https://www.compassionateleadershipsummit.org/bilal-saad-ghalib \n2017 Roundglass fellowship\n2014 INK Fellow IndiaI am known in Beirut for helping establish a community home called Beit Al Atlas which is currently being run by my mentee Saleh. I have a small etsy shop where I sell natural products through what I call a \"beauty based business\" meaning every part of the value chain is uplifted when there is a transaction (https://www.etsy.com/shop/NurCreativeStudio) `I am unstoppably curious. I believe in the unity of all things and work to build bridges across many things. I love programmable art, I am a perfumist, I love screen printing, playing bass guitar, improvising lyrics, writing poems. I am fascinated by the non-violent Sufi led protest movement in Senegal which overthrew the French colonialist power. At bloom we are integrating psychometric assessments and interventions from positive psychology into our programs. Our programs work on three aspects of a person: their will and intention, their social and emotional skills, and their practical skills. In entrepreneurship training this is unique as we have different measures we quantify, rather than only helping our teams grow businesses we ensure the growth of their whole selves and communities. Our participants leave our programs with a new conception of success being collective as well as individual. A recent example, and one that makes me feel proud, is just this month in our program in Lebanon we held a checkin with all of the teams in our online accelerator. In that checkin one of our team members remarked that the first people to check on them after the catastrophic blast that rocked Beirut was the group, and that they were so glad to be a part of a community of deep support like this. This is why I love my work.As an technologist, entrepreneur and design thinking trainer I came to supporting entrepreneurs with what I now call \"specialized skills\". Things you can learn from books. Initially, I hoped to see positive collective action when people accessed resources. Yet, as I learned more I realized that the mindset we approach our work greatly determines what we do. This is what led me to start to research the psychological and metacognitive aspects that impact self perception and ability to lead socially relevant entrepreneurial teams. My work has been to codify the pedagogy of our program and to operate the pilot programs as a facilitator. Why are you living in France if your work is in MENA?\nI was inspired by Father Greg Boyle who, when asked why he lived in LA in a poor neighborhood, he said: \"I live with my friends.\" The idea of my contribution naturally arising from care for friends was so beautiful I chose to go to Beirut and open my home to my neighbors. This eventually became Beit Al Atlas. After 3 years, I realized that aligning my life in Beirut was beautiful. My life partner was in France and I realized that I needed to restructure my life so I took care of myself, my family, and then outward. So, me and Josephine got married, I live in France, and I continue to work virtually in the Midddle East. The process of clarifying intention and action continues. One day at Beit Al Atlas we had a visiting artist, Zeyn Joukhadar. Me, Zeyn and Ahmed, were praying on the roof. Ahmed is a Syrian refugee in Beirut. His father was killed in Syria.

Early morning light poured through our windows, painting the walls orange. In that instant—his tiny hand on mine, war raging in Palestine, the future uncertain—I felt a wave of awe. I remember crying and thinking: This moment is enough for a life.\nThat quiet morning stood in stark contrast to my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016), in elite circles discussing life extension or pitches, no one seemed to value a simple life, and it seemed no one had babies. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought of the human will.Whatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, we nerds started getting rich for the same traits that led to us being bullied in high school. In that bubble, Marc Andreesen’s prophecy that “software would eat the world” felt more like a battle cry than the warning it should have been. We devoured his essays, wrote code to cut repetitive tasks, and started businesses to solve any friction we saw—and it “worked.”In my Muslim household in Michigan, I was raised to believe this life was just a test. Yet, everything I learned while crashing the country's elite technical university, MIT, told me the world was understandable, malleable, and ours to shape.Many of my college friends went on to leave their mark on the world, start businesses, build satellite technology, or get jobs at Google. Making money was a sign that they did something valuable, and thus the richer some of us got, the more we all believed they were on the right path. We knew that knowledge is power, innovation is king, and by our collective guidance, humanity is destined for the stars. \nDriven by optimism, I launched a makerspace in Michigan and a robotics company, confident that success was measured by dollars earned and problems solved. My mantra was, \"If we can, we should.\" Our creations would lead to a flourishing future as more people joined the movement. Around this time, the Arab Spring ignited hope among young Arabs like me, inspiring a new idea to take shape.\nWith the hackerspace growing at home and the robotics company launching our factory robot I believed we could replicate this energy around the world and create an army of positive change makers, all working on technology and entrepreneurship to shape a better world. It sounded good to me back then, and that’s how I came to found the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), to take the ideas I learned at MIT and Silicon Valley—both of which felt more like temples to a religion of science and progress than a university– “back home” to Iraq and South West Asia and North African (SWANA) more broadly. I started in Egypt with Maker Faire Africa, the thought was to infect people with transmissible ideas by giving them a direct experience of innovation hubs. In those days, the Arab Spring was still young, and people were excited to see a youth movement topple authoritarian regimes. Growing up as an Iraqi American, I remember hushed conversations in my family’s living room, stories of how a so and so had vanished after a stray comment about the government shared with only direct family members. It led me to believe that direct opposition to the leadership was not an intelligent way forward for the movement. Taking what I learned from Silicon Valley, I suggested that instead of asking for a different future - we should build it. Seeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future if its young people gathered together in spaces, collaborating, innovating, and starting businesses was an appealing idea for people around the world, and I received recognition and support. That recognition was enough to fuel me; I was on the right path; fame and glory, and probably money too, was soon to be mine. Yet somehow, I had forgotten the stories of my family members killed during a war now recognized internationally as being started by a deliberate lie about weapons of mass destruction. My work started involving me in global geopolitical issues I was dimly aware of, and I was a grain of sand swirling around in a dust storm. I promised a beautiful vision of the world, a grassroots rag-tag team of technology-powered super-hackers out to build a better future, car bombs or no car bombs. Back then, the reality of how power, money, and conflict were interrelated was invisible to me. All I knew was that I started feeling uneasy. Once, while I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera and highlighted as a “youth leader,” I left the call feeling proud, and that pride made me uneasy. What the heck was I doing? Who was I helping? Why was I trying to help anyone? My work took me around the world, including active conflict areas, and it was after a trip to a refugee camp in Qah, Syria, where I was working on a storytelling project for young children, that led me to start to doubt my work. I heard story after story of [[[censored for your sanity]]]. Yet those same people who experienced so much violence offered me food and shelter. I had brought solar-powered lights for a shadow puppet workshop, thinking I could be helpful. In truth, I was the one being helped.When I returned to San Francisco from Qah I found myself invited to Facebook’s end of year party. It was around that time I learned that two beautiful seven-year-old girls from the camp—Katya and her friend—had been killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school. All the fun and opulence of the startup scene felt obscene.That’s when the power of the stories of technology changing the world for the better started dissolving. How could we pretend we’re “making the world a better place” when this was the reality children were facing, and this was a tiny glimpse into a world of hurt? That’s when the Silicon Valley religion of making the world a better place died for me.For a couple of years after that, I was numb. I felt like the curtains had been pulled back, and I saw the show for what it was, (my) egocentricity and love for wealth and power disguised as a story about changing the world. Not knowing what to do, I joined another Silicon Valley religion: mindfulness meditation. It promised peace in this life without worry, and I dove in wholeheartedly, seeking to escape my inner turmoil and loss of compass. In 2013/2014, I would meditate every day for an hour in a park. One of these days, I found that as I was doing my body scan meditation, going ring by ring down my body, at some point, when I arrived at my groin, I felt like I was pierced by a sword, and I lept out of my cross-legged position. As I hobbled over to my bike, confused and in pain, I wondered: “What just happened? Why am I in this much pain?”Before heading home, I checked my phone for directions home and saw that someone from Iraq had sent me an urgent message. Back in 2013, working with [redacted], we had brought open-source radiation sensors to validate Iraqi doctors' claims that the depleted uranium ammunition from the wars was resulting in increased cancer rates. The story of that adventure is for another time; this time, let’s focus on the phone message.  [Redacted]'s call for help was the start of a turnaround for me. He was being threatened with death, allegedly for the work we did together, “collaborating with Americans.”I realized that I was far away, unable to help, and getting good people into trouble for doing “good work.” I realized that I was creating communities, yet not a part of any of them. I wasn’t even sure what good looked like anymore. Every Silicon Valley salon felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, every talk I was invited to give, a lie… until, one day, I stood at the podium and blurted out: “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.” The audience smiled and nodded, looking at me pitifully. They must have known about Katya and the girls at Qah.After that, the speaking agencies stopped calling. I grew increasingly insular, slept a lot, and often didn’t leave my house for days on end. My meditation practice wasn’t helping, I found greater distance from my feelings, a lack of desire, and what I felt as a growing comfort with numbness. Looking back, I can see that these were all symptoms of undiagnosed vicarious Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I knew about PTSD, yet I didn’t realize that my experiences of car bombings in Iraq, the deaths around me, and living/working in war zones could have scarred me for years without ever being physically injured. One day, while deep in the haze of trauma, sugar-coated with the equanimity of mindfulness, I met my future wife. In those days, I was at such a loss, I was “looking within” for guidance, working on accessing my intuition, reflecting on the world, and coming up with theories of change, attempting to understand the news, social media, open source technology, impact, goodness, etc. Yet I couldn’t figure it out. I was rejected from every fellowship I applied to from Harvard to the Bay and I was going in intellectual circles. When I met Josephine, I remember thinking, “This time, I will listen to something else, no more ideas and explanations.” Logic had failed me thus far. Every time I came up with a theory of change, every business plan to change the world, every time I was smart in relationships, it had not worked. This time, something else spoke up. The moment I hugged Josephine, I felt my shoulders relax, and a quiet voice said, “Yes.”That was the first time I listened to the voice of deeper meaning. In my life, I find this voice hard to listen to, and when I hear it - it’s been easy to ignore. Yet, seeing that voice was like a light in the darkness. A calling to a different way of being in the world. One that seemed irrational and unlikely to make me famous or rich. One that told me to call my mom and spend time in nature. A voice that wasn’t about understanding the world and leveraging it to serve me… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.These were the early days of healing for me. I realized I had to stop listening to myself and listen to something else, yet I didn’t know what my new path was. What was the voice? How could I know it was trustworthy? How would I explain it to my hyper-rational, reductionist friends?I was searching for things that made my heart sing. My spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what I deeply believed: that God is beautiful and loves beauty. I chose to use my life to follow a path of beauty. That way, when I died either way life was beautiful.\nMy religious and spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what was true to me at the core. I found the Islamic principle that God is beautiful and loves beauty stood the test of reason and spirit. If I chose to live a beautiful life I’d have a beautiful life, and when I die… well, we’d see then. This exploration led me to Krista Tippett’s On Being, a podcast full of stories about selflessness, care, and the beauty of human potential. When I heard Jean Vanier’s story of building communities for people with disabilities, something in me cracked open. For the first time in years, I cried, and those tears reminded me that I was still human.\nI listened to nearly every episode, but Father Greg Boyle’s story finally unlocked a path forward. The founder of Homeboy and Homegirl Industries, he helps former prisoners reintegrate with jobs, tattoo removal, and community support. When asked why he does this work, he didn’t say, “God told me to,” or, “It’s the right thing to do.” He simply said, “They’re my friends. So what else would I do?” That response shifted everything for me.\nFather Boyle working for a future outcome or trying to make a dent in the universe. His actions weren’t tied to expectations or good intentions—they emerged naturally from his way of being. The immediacy, focusing on living beautifully in the present moment, showed me that don’t need to have good intentions, that beauty isn’t about solving the world’s problems; beautiful actions emerge from true relationships, that truth builds relationships of love, and love gives birth to beauty. Over the next few months, I mulled Father Boyle’s words over in my mind and by 2016, I found myself on a plane to Beirut. Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night, where my nerd community was, and where the challenges of the Syrian refugees were most intense. It was there that we started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.Saleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas. He was born in a Syrian Palestinian refugee camp, and he had led a tough life up until we met in the refugee camps of Beirut. It was while he was hiding from the police at my house that we decided to start Beit Al Atlas. At Beit Al Atlas, we would host artists, international journalists, and for whatever reason, many people from Denmark. Early mornings the house would fill with the smell of coffee and the melodious sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our international resident from India, would make coffee for the house.Slowly, the house became a home for Saleh and me, a garden for the Syrian refugees who worked polishing shoes on our doorstep, a place for book clubs and dinners, and most importantly, a place for stories and connection. The house faced many struggles, yet through our diversity and connections through love with people around the world, we always found enough support to keep the doors open and the coffee pouring. As beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself properly. When I moved to Beirut, Josephine had been wanting me to live with her, to marry her, to start a family together. She would visit the house, and at some point, Ahmed, one of the Syrian refugees who became part of our family, took off one of his rings and gave it to me, saying: Bilal, give this ring to Josephine to give to you. Enough already, go get married and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful.”I stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s worth of earnings for him. Yet he gave it to me so I could do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman my heart said yes to, the woman who loved me.Back then, I was too invested in having an impact. Living in Beirut and building this house was more important than love, stability, and babies. That’s when I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good,” even if Saleh was my friend, even if the house was authentically building beautiful and unlikely cross-cultural relationships, I was ignoring something profound, I was ignoring the one who loves me. Ahmed helped me see that, even though he left Syria when he was 11 after his father was shot by the Asad regime, even though he speaks with a lisp - a potential mark of deep trauma, he helped me see the beautiful thing to do. In the Muslim tradition, it’s said that the best charity is the charity one gives to one’s family, it’s said that those who are nearest to you deserve the most of you, and somehow, I was committing my life to beautiful friends, yet leaving alone and sad in France the person who wants to start a family with me. This is when I finally started a more profound process of submission. Through Ahmed’s guidance, I was able to see that the Muslim tradition that I had left in Michigan so long ago had keys to a life in service to the quiet voice I found so hard to hear. By submitting my life to my sense of beauty, to the voice, and realized that that voice also left us many clues within us, in the world, and in the beautiful stories of the prophet and his Holy Book, the Quran. My relationship with submission to the divine could take a whole other book, let’s suffice it here to say that I started seeing the deeper wisdom in a tradition I had been ignoring. Finally, leaving the religion of progress, of what I thought goodness was, the religion that wants the self to leave a mark on the world, positive or not, made room for me to submit to a most Merciful God that is weaving the most beautiful story possible.It was then that I finally started the long journey back to that moment in France. And so I packed my bags, leaving Beit Al Atlas in the capable hands of Saleh and friends. I flew to France to finally honor the commitment I’d kept in limbo—the commitment that opened the doors to baby Suleiman and that moment at the threshold of 2024, where I was holding my baby, feeling that all was just as it should be in this crazy world cradled in the hands of the most Merciful.The first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity as someone who goes where the difficulties are, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, etc, and works to build community and create beauty in unexpected places. In a world that pushes us to greater heights, usually implying further and further distance from yourself, your wife and children, your parents, cousins, and high school friends, I've been working to slowly reintegrate myself with myself, build a loving home with my wife, making space for our baby Suleiman, and it all came full circle that morning as I held little Suli and cried. One eye overflowing with tears of sorrow… the other eye with tears of love.EditFRAMEWORK: FROM IMPACT TO PRESENCE\nCore Journey:\nLove → Relationship → Truth → Beauty\n\nTHE PROGRESSION\n\n\nFrom fixing to being\nFrom metrics to meaning\nFrom impact to presence\nFrom separation to relationship\n\n\nKEY PRINCIPLES\n\n\nBeauty emerges from authentic relationship\nTruth reveals itself through presence\nLove guides more reliably than logic\nMeaning found in direct experience\n\nEXPERT DIALOGUE:\nDr. Otto Scharmer (Theory U, MIT):\n\"What strikes me about your framework is how it aligns with what we've observed in transformative leadership - this movement from downloading past patterns to sensing and presencing.

The mind can move the body and can have memories of stories reviewing stories can evoke states especially if they are meaningful and connected to ways of being that are aligned with what the spirit wants so you can think of attentional policies as some sort of vector that we aim to have the entire system aligned around in the Muslim tradition there mind body spirit (divine) soul(unique to you perfectible and corrupt able) and heart your heart is turning qlb(flipping) between the divine spirit and the soul",

No doubt, every one of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.\n\nSource: Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 7138, Grade: Muttafaqun Alayhi\n\n—\n\nHadith 30\n\nIbn Umar reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\nأَحَبُّ النَّاسِ إِلَى اللَّهِ أَنْفَعُهُمْ لِلنَّاسِ وَأَحَبُّ الأَعْمَالِ إِلَى اللَّهِ سُرُورٌ تُدْخِلُهُ عَلَى مُسْلِمٍ أَوْ تَكْشِفُ عَنْهُ كُرْبَةً أَوْ تَقْضِي عَنْهُ دِينًا أَوْ تَطْرُدُ عَنْهُ جُوعًا وَلَأَنْ أَمْشِيَ مَعَ أَخِيهِ فِي حَاجَةٍ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِنْ أَنْ أَعْتَكِفَ فِي هَذَا الْمَسْجِدِ يَعْنِي مَسْجِدَ الْمَدِينَةِ شَهْرًا وَمَنْ كَفَّ غَضَبَهُ سَتَرَ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ وَمَنْ كَظَمَ غَيْظَهُ وَلَوْ شَاءَ أَنْ يُمْضِيَهُ أَمْضَاهُ مَلأَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ قَلْبَهُ أَمْنًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَمَنْ مَشَى مَعَ أَخِيهِ فِي حَاجَةٍ حَتَّى أَثْبَتَهَا لَهُ أَثْبَتَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ قَدَمَهُ عَلَى الصِّرَاطِ يَوْمَ تَزِلُّ فِيهِ الأَقْدَامُ\n\nThe most beloved people to Allah are those who are most beneficial to people. The most beloved deed to Allah is to make a Muslim happy, or to remove one of his troubles, or to forgive his debt, or to feed his hunger. That I walk with a brother regarding a need is more beloved to me than that I seclude myself in this mosque in Medina for a month. Whoever swallows his anger, then Allah will conceal his faults. Whoever suppresses his rage, even though he could fulfill his anger if he wished, then Allah will secure his heart on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever walks with his brother regarding a need until he secures it for him, then Allah Almighty will make his footing firm across the bridge on the day when the footings are shaken.\n\nSource: al-Muʻjam al-Awsaṭ 6026, Grade: Sahih\n\n—\n\nHadith 31\n\nAbu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\nلَا يَسْتُرُ عَبْدٌ عَبْدًا فِي الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا سَتَرَهُ اللَّهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ\n\nA servant does not cover the faults of another servant in the world but that Allah will cover his faults on the Day of Resurrection.\n\nSource: Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2590, Grade: Sahih\n\n—\n\nHadith 32\n\nAbu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\nوَاللَّهِ إِنِّي لَأَسْتَغْفِرُ اللَّهَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْهِ فِي الْيَوْمِ أَكْثَرَ مِنْ سَبْعِينَ مَرَّةً\n\nBy Allah, I seek forgiveness from Allah and I repent to him more than seventy times in a day.\n\nSource: Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 6307, Grade: Sahih\n\n—\n\nHadith 33\n\nAnas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\nطَلَبُ الْعِلْمِ فَرِيضَةٌ عَلَى كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ\n\nSeeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.\n\nSource: Sunan Ibn Mājah 224, Grade: Sahih\n\n—\n\nHadith 34\n\nAl-Nu’man ibn Bashir reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\nمَثَلُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فِي تَوَادِّهِمْ وَتَرَاحُمِهِمْ وَتَعَاطُفِهِمْ مَثَلُ الْجَسَدِ إِذَا اشْتَكَى مِنْهُ عُضْوٌ تَدَاعَى لَهُ سَائِرُ الْجَسَدِ بِالسَّهَرِ وَالْحُمَّى\n\nThe parable of the believers in their affection, mercy, and compassion for each other is that of a body.

Verily, truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man continues to be truthful and encourages honesty until he is recorded with Allah as truthful. And beware of falsehood. Verily, falsehood leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to the Hellfire. A man continues tell lies and encourages falsehood until he is recorded with Allah as a liar.\n\nSource: Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2607, Grade: Muttafaqun Alayhi\n\n—\n\nHadith 37\n\nAbu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\nأَتَدْرُونَ مَا الْمُفْلِسُ\n\nDo you know who is bankrupt?\n\nThey said, “The one without money or goods is bankrupt.” The Prophet said:\n\nإِنَّ الْمُفْلِسَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَأْتِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بِصَلَاةٍ وَصِيَامٍ وَزَكَاةٍ وَيَأْتِي قَدْ شَتَمَ هَذَا وَقَذَفَ هَذَا وَأَكَلَ مَالَ هَذَا وَسَفَكَ دَمَ هَذَا وَضَرَبَ هَذَا فَيُعْطَى هَذَا مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ وَهَذَا مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ فَإِنْ فَنِيَتْ حَسَنَاتُهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُقْضَى مَا عَلَيْهِ أُخِذَ مِنْ خَطَايَاهُمْ فَطُرِحَتْ عَلَيْهِ ثُمَّ طُرِحَ فِي النَّارِ\n\nVerily, the bankrupt of my nation are those who come on the Day of Resurrection with prayers, fasting, and charity, but also with insults, slander, consuming wealth, shedding blood, and beating others. The oppressed will each be given from his good deeds. If his good deeds run out before justice is fulfilled, then their sins will be cast upon him and he will be thrown into the Hellfire.\n\nSource: Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2581, Grade: Sahih\n\n—\n\nHadith 38\n\nAbu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\nسَبْعَةٌ يُظِلُّهُمْ اللَّهُ فِي ظِلِّهِ يَوْمَ لَا ظِلَّ إِلَّا ظِلُّهُ الْإِمَامُ الْعَادِلُ وَشَابٌّ نَشَأَ بِعِبَادَةِ اللَّهِ وَرَجُلٌ قَلْبُهُ مُعَلَّقٌ فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ وَرَجُلَانِ تَحَابَّا فِي اللَّهِ اجْتَمَعَا عَلَيْهِ وَتَفَرَّقَا عَلَيْهِ وَرَجُلٌ دَعَتْهُ امْرَأَةٌ ذَاتُ مَنْصِبٍ وَجَمَالٍ فَقَالَ إِنِّي أَخَافُ اللَّهَ وَرَجُلٌ تَصَدَّقَ بِصَدَقَةٍ فَأَخْفَاهَا حَتَّى لَا تَعْلَمَ يَمِينُهُ مَا تُنْفِقُ شِمَالُهُ وَرَجُلٌ ذَكَرَ اللَّهَ خَالِيًا فَفَاضَتْ عَيْنَاهُ\n\nThere are seven whom Allah will shade on a day when there is no shade but his. They are a just ruler, a youth who grew up in the worship of Allah, one whose heart is attached to the mosques, two who love each other, meet ,and depart from each other for the sake of Allah, a man who is tempted by a beautiful woman of high status but he rejects her, saying ,’I fear Allah,’ one spends in charity and conceals it such that his right hand does not know what his left hand has given, and one who remembered Allah in private and he wept.\n\nSource: Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 660, Grade: Muttafaqun Alayhi\n\n—\n\nHadith 39\n\nAnas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\nالتَّأَنِّي مِنَ اللَّهِ وَالْعَجَلَةُ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ\n\nCalmness is from Allah, and recklessness is from Satan.\n\nSource: al-Sunan al-Kubrá 20270, Grade: Hasan\n\n—\n\nHadith 40\n\nAbu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\nلَيْسَ الْغِنَى عَنْ كَثْرَةِ الْعَرَضِ وَلَكِنَّ الْغِنَى غِنَى النَّفْسِ\n\nWealth is not in having many possessions.

And to map it with attentional policies that are about the sources of meaning. So like the thing that we pay attention to and a sentence that describes it. So for instance, moments where there's light-hearted and joyful conversation, or spaces where people can express their colors and creativity, or sunsets where the sky turns many colors. Or I don't know, things like that. Joe Edelman's values framework, because I really think that there's a way of understanding that source of attention and sources of meaning as a connection with the things that make us come alive. And it reminds me, and I'm pairing that with the quote, like, don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive, and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people that have come alive. And I'm working on this assumption that our coming alive comes through our daily actions, our to-do lists, our habits, and what we do on a day-to-day. When we can use that to identify moments where we are either coming alive or not coming alive. And that's what I would like to do with a quick check-in. And when we're not coming alive, there's tension or negative emotions. And we can use the process of all of our emotions are trying to tell us something. And actually, the idea that everything is always talking to us and trying to tell us something. And it's either tension, and that means that there are different things that we're trying to attend to at the same time that are incommensurate. We want to attend to our baby's laugh and presence with us at the same time as we're trying to attend to crafting a philosophy of action and growth that is philosophically rigorous and intellectually stimulating and creative and fun. And what I'm doing right now, my baby's over there, but I have these two tensions. And so how can we do these things together? And I guess I could talk it out to my baby and pretend that he can understand, actually bring him into the process. And so that creative, productive framing of how can I find a higher level action or things to attend to that will be able to address the underlying conflicts in the sources of meaning. And I call the other thing pressures of doing. So neither internal or external. So they could be norms or other things that are not really on the conscious level, just things that you do because that's what people do. I got a job, or I do this, or I do that. And I got to get to work. Why do you gotta, gotta, gotta? And so it's like the shoulds and the want-tos in our lives, I think, is another way of thinking about these things. When you have a bunch of shoulds, you can think that they're probably a bunch of instrumental things or things that are unconscious or things that are beyond our choice and intention. So the idea is to move more of our actions into the place of intentionality and into a place where we can actually be connected to our sources of meaning and flow. And even if they're like sleep or things that are very practical with good intentions, you can always find a way of connecting these things. And I think that's a really important thing to do because so many people are just like living on autopilot. And so I think there's something about this that I'm really trying to figure out to see if I have everything, if I have full coverage onto the human condition, or if I'm missing some fundamental things about other reasons why people might get stuck or not live the way that they want to live. And if I'm missing things that would be important to add in this framework, or is this useful enough? And then what are the important parts to save, right? Should we only save the sources of attention for all of the meaningful things, or should we save the story? Does the story actually have some special sauce that's gonna be important? Because in the future, I just want to save the minimal subset of things that's gonna be really helpful for the person and not like absolutely everything, like the pressures and the tensions and how they relate and like every single bit of resource that the person has from like a laptop to a friend that they can call and then what is their relationship? And then what is the, you know, that gets to be too huge. I'm trying to come up with like a very streamlined, very elegant, high leverage thing that actually puts the mirror pointing at the person and asks them questions about those fundamental resources like relationships and others, but doesn't even have to necessarily say the word relationships. Like what has helped you in the past? Think of stories, situations, contexts, like large abstract words like that so that people can reflect and be like, oh, you know what? I really loved it when I had the support of my friends on jobs because I'm just way better in a pair programming process. And then we can derive like new sources of meaning and new ways for that person to live their values. And I'm really just need some questions and some digging in to figure out if I'm on the right track or if I need some help getting this structured better.”\n05:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt sounds like you're trying to design a system that aligns daily actions with deeper sources of meaning, using intentionality to foster a more meaningful life. The quote you're referencing serves as a great starting point, mapping out how thoughts lead to destiny.\n\nTo operationalize this, you could start by identifying key \"sources of meaning\" for individuals, such as moments that spark joy or creativity. Reflect on how these sources can be incorporated into daily actions and habits.\n\nYour framework could use reflective questions to prompt self-awareness:\n\nWhat activities make you feel most alive?\nWhen do you notice a sense of flow or joy?\nHow can you incorporate these moments into your daily life?\nTo address the tensions between \"shoulds\" and \"wants,\" you might emphasize:\n\nShifting actions from autopilot (external pressures) to intentionality (internal meaning).\nIdentifying and minimizing unconscious influences.\nStreamlining this approach involves:\n\nFocusing on high-leverage questions that reveal core values and patterns.\nEncouraging actions aligned with those values.\nIt sounds like you're exploring a powerful method to bring awareness to our daily choices, which is incredibly valuable. Keep refining your questions to ensure they resonate and inspire meaningful action!\n\n11:58\n\nYou said:\n“Okay, yeah, that sounds good, except I was looking to see if this is comprehensive. I'm wondering if, like, a coach or a psychologist may be able to tell me that I'm actually missing some fundamental elements that are critical for this, and we're trying to get people to basically come alive and be the best for themselves and for others. And I first of all want to, like, know, is it true that the world needs people that have come alive? Like, is that really all that you need, and what does it mean to come alive, you know, I think, to be sources of meaning is a way to really find what lights you up, and you'll have more energy, you'll have more commitments, you'll have more attention and focus and draw to do these things, but who knows if that will actually lead to a more possible and sustainable world. I think it's related to Plato's Golden Mean. Maybe there's a way of, like, really understanding the philosophical rigor here, and whether or not I'm just doing, like, a small thing that might help a little bit, or if I'm doing something that's actually transformational for individuals and for the planet, because I'm trying to let go of running a social enterprise accelerator and thinking I know what a better future looks like, and incentivizing entrepreneurs that work in the social space to reduce CO2 emissions or employ refugees, and instead thinking of, like, what if we just help people see who they are, what the world is, and feel really deeply about what makes them come to life and what they want to contribute in an authentic way, in this way reducing burnout and actually increasing authenticity and making the world more diverse, unique, and whole, because people are actually being what they are, like a tree that produces apples is going to be producing apples, and the worm that eats those apples is going to eat those apples, and the bird that eats the worm and the apples is going to poop some seeds somewhere and plant new trees and kind of, like, become this ecosystemic thing, but you don't have to think about the long consequences of your actions and monitor impact and measures. Instead, you have to think really deeply about what is coming around you right now in your field of vision, in your awareness, and as you grow and as you learn and as the world is getting more and more deeply interconnected, we will see refugees. We will see the burning that's happening in California. People will be doing the science, because there are people who come alive doing the science, and they're going to be telling us these stories, the journalists who are coming live, telling us the stories of how the science related to CO2 is related to the burning, and we will feel this care and this passion, and the people that live closest to the fires will tell the stories about how to best help those and will maybe transform how they work, and we don't need to kind of use governments and pressure and taxes and incentivize solar panels and tell people to go green and blame and judge, and instead, there's a different way, and I think this just might be a philosophically rigorous and psychologically sound way of helping more people come alive, and, you know, like, let's just keep this whole thing about sustainability, right? Like, consume less, right? Because they'll be more content. They'll actually connect their work with meaning, and what would happen if this planet had more content people on it? Like, it would be very interesting to do an economic study of contentedness.”\n11:58\n03:21\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour vision of helping people come alive and connect with their deeper sources of meaning is indeed comprehensive and philosophically rich. You're tapping into a powerful idea that aligns with the concept of eudaimonia, or flourishing, which is central to many philosophical traditions, including Aristotle's.\n\nThe idea that the world needs more people who are alive—engaged, passionate, and living authentically—resonates deeply. This state of being can lead to more sustainable and compassionate actions, creating a ripple effect that benefits society and the planet. It aligns well with the idea of contentment and reducing unnecessary consumption.\n\nTo ensure comprehensiveness, it might be helpful to consider:\n\nDiverse Perspectives: Include inputs from coaches, psychologists, and different cultural frameworks to ensure it resonates broadly.\nPractical Implementation: Develop tools or practices that help people identify and sustain these sources of meaning in their daily lives.\nMeasuring Impact: While it's less about rigid metrics, consider ways to observe and reflect on the transformation in individuals and communities.\nThe shift from focusing on specific outcomes (like reducing CO2) to nurturing authenticity and connection might be more sustainable and transformative. It's a beautiful and ambitious vision, and your approach could indeed be a profound way to foster individual and collective well-being. It's worth exploring further, perhaps through pilot programs or small groups to test and refine your ideas. Keep digging into these questions, and you might find a truly transformative path.\n\n12:03\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think there's something here as well, and I'd love to hear you explain Aristotle's eudaimonia concept and the concept of the golden mean and how they could relate. And also the idea that I have that is not very clear in how it could be true or how it could be false. Identify a critic of these ideas and a proponent of these ideas and have them discussed back before coming to a conclusion. And the idea that I want them to discuss is that they have a possibility to have a scalable, transformative world that is able to address these kind of thorny, interconnected VUCA problems by just paying attention to their context and their situation and their feelings and what makes them come to life and their sources of meaning. There's one way that I described, which is consentedness, that also reduces consumption, which is the core factor leading to the emissions of greenhouse gases and all of this stuff. And the other one is this idea that, you know, people will actually care. They'll love their planet. There's some people that will come to life nurturing nature, regenerating forests, and hearing these stories can be inspiring to us. The story of the Patagonia founder, the story of the person who planted a million trees, or the person who does these regenerative agroforestry projects, or feeds their communities with an urban farm in Detroit. And someone else might be inspired and love that and find their sources of meaning through this. But I don't want to direct people towards that. I want to direct people towards that process. And I guess the big element is this element of trust. And that would mean that, like, do I trust that the world is sort of self-consistent and that there are signals enough in the right places that if people are paying attention, that the signals will transform into truth that they see if they are, like, I don't know. It requires this kind of open curiosity and exploration of the world and, like, a little bit of an understanding of what's happening. Let's imagine that we didn't freak people out about climate change and we just told people to go live, you know, and see. And people would be like, oh, look at this degraded ecosystem. Like, it hurts me to see because next door I've seen these things that are beautiful, like, wonderful, green, lush places. Like, why isn't this like that? And then asking these questions and, like, feeling and being sensitive and then responding. I feel like there needs to be an element of education, but this element of exposure and seeing and maybe some people can really understand systems thinking and they have the capacity and the cognitive development to be able to do that. Some people are just kids and they need to be, you know, like, grown and be able to see and feel and do, see the world, see the truth, feel, care, find their sources of meaning in the way that they action and do something beautiful, do something about it. And then we need to empower people with resources, right? So, I'm really wondering if this is enough and, like, if that quote, like, I want you to ask me a couple of questions to help me discover for myself. And then maybe also give me a bunch of critics that would say that this is wrong. And why is it wrong? Rigorously and philosophically. Like, who out there in academia, who out there in, like, the lived experience, maybe, like, indigenous peoples or others or people that think that we have to really understand the world before fixing it and that we can measure change as important, like, all the people that are working in governments and such, trying to create incentives for people to have a life that is more sustainable and, yeah, come back to me with a list of questions and arguments that kind of contradict this idea that don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do that. And, you know, maybe there's two elements, right? It's like, ask what makes you come alive and go do that. In a way, that creates harmony. I don't know, like, does there need to be an addition to that quote or not? Is it good enough on its own if we trust the hearts of people?”\n12:03\n04:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAristotle's eudaimonia, often translated as \"flourishing\" or \"the good life,\" is about living in a way that fulfills one's potential and aligns with virtues. The Golden Mean is about balance—finding a middle ground between extremes, like courage being the mean between recklessness and cowardice.\n\nThese concepts can relate to your idea by emphasizing balance in living a meaningful life, one that’s in harmony with oneself and the world.\n\nTo explore your idea's strengths and weaknesses, here's a dialogue:\n\nProponent: \"Focusing on what makes us come alive can lead to genuine engagement and positive action. When people are deeply connected to their passions and sources of meaning, they naturally contribute in ways that benefit themselves and the world. Contentment can reduce consumption, and nurturing what brings joy can lead to sustainability.\"\n\nCritic: \"But what if individual passions don't align with collective good? Not everyone’s 'coming alive' might lead to positive outcomes, and focusing solely on personal joy could overlook systemic issues. We also need structural changes and collective action to address broader problems.\"\n\nProponent: \"True, but if individuals are more content and connected to their purpose, they might naturally work towards collective good. It's about fostering a deeper awareness and responsibility, which can lead to structural changes from a place of authenticity.\"\n\nCritic: \"Yet we can't ignore the need for external structures and incentives. Trusting that everyone will 'come alive' in a way that benefits the world might be idealistic. We need a balance of individual transformation and societal structures to ensure sustainable outcomes.\"\n\nTo sum up, your idea has the potential to be transformative but may need to be complemented with structural supports. The balance of individual authenticity and collective action could be the key.\n\nAs you explore this further, consider questions like:\n\nHow can we ensure individual passions align with collective good?\nWhat role do societal structures play in supporting or hindering this process?\nHow can we measure the impact of this shift in perspective on broader societal goals?\nYour approach is promising, blending philosophical depth with practical applications. Keep refining it, and it could indeed become a transformative force.\n\n12:09\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, you know, you're right. Like, we can't trust that everyone's purpose and things that make them come alive will be the thing that will bring them to social and collective positive change. I mean, there are sociopaths, and so maybe what we need to do is include that data about how many people in the world are sociopaths.”\n12:09\n00:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful\n\n12:10\n\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n12:10\n00:01\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful consideration. Including data on different motivations and behaviors can help create a more robust system. It's important to recognize that while many people may find positive, socially beneficial purposes, there are also those who might not.\n\nBy acknowledging this diversity, you can design mechanisms that guide people towards constructive and positive actions, balancing individual growth with collective well-being. It\n\n12:10\n\nYou said:\nI know that one of the ancient philosophers had some of these ideas that, you know, people should find their place and the structure becomes a whole. I thought it was Plato, and I thought it had something to do with golden or middle. Can't really remember. Can you help me figure out what that was?\n12:10\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou might be thinking of Plato's idea of the \"ideal city\" in his work The Republic, or Aristotle's concept of the \"Golden Mean.\" Here's how they align with what you're describing:\n\nPlato and the Ideal City (The Republic)\nPlato argued that a harmonious society is one where everyone \"finds their place\" based on their natural abilities and virtues. He divided society into three classes:\n\nRulers (philosopher-kings): Govern based on wisdom.\nGuardians (soldiers): Protect based on courage.\nProducers (farmers, artisans, etc.): Provide goods and services based on their practical skills.\nIn this structure, individuals contribute to the whole according to their role, creating a just and unified society. Plato emphasized that justice arises when everyone fulfills their role without interfering in others' roles.\n\nAristotle's Golden Mean\nAristotle, a student of Plato, developed the idea of the Golden Mean, which is about finding balance or moderation between extremes. For example:\n\nCourage lies between recklessness and cowardice.\nGenerosity lies between wastefulness and stinginess.\nWhile the Golden Mean primarily applies to personal virtues, Aristotle also emphasized the importance of individuals living in accordance with their nature and contributing to the \"polis\" (community) for a flourishing society.\n\nConnecting the Dots\nIf you're thinking about \"people finding their place\" and a \"structure becoming a whole,\" Plato's ideal city seems to fit. If the \"golden\" part feels important, Aristotle's Golden Mean might resonate. Both philosophers explored how individuals and communities achieve harmony through balance and fulfilling their natural roles.\n\n12:18\n\nYou said:\nIs there another philosopher from antiquity or the, you know, the last couple of 2,000 years that talks about this strong, stable, and structured society when people were who they were meant to be, something like that? Who might be the philosopher that fits that category?\n12:18\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, several philosophers across antiquity and the last 2,000 years have explored the idea of a strong, stable, and structured society based on people fulfilling their purpose or role. Here are a few key figures who might align with what you're describing:\n\nConfucius (551–479 BCE) Confucius emphasized the importance of li (ritual and social order) and ren (virtue and benevolence) in creating a harmonious society. He argued that:\nA stable society depends on everyone fulfilling their roles within relationships (parent-child, ruler-subject, etc.).\nPeople thrive when they live in alignment with their moral duties and cultivate virtue.\nThis Confucian vision is about balance within a structured society, where each person contributes based on their position and responsibilities.\n2. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)\nAquinas built on Aristotle’s philosophy within a Christian framework. He argued that:\n\nSociety is structured around a divine hierarchy, with everyone having a God-given role.\nPeople fulfill their purpose through their roles, which ultimately lead to the common good and spiritual flourishing.\nAquinas saw harmony and stability as arising when individuals live according to both their natural and divine purpose.\n3. Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406)\nThe Islamic philosopher and historian Ibn Khaldun proposed a cyclical theory of societal rise and decline. His key ideas include:\n\nSocieties are held together by asabiyyah (social cohesion or solidarity).\nStability and prosperity depend on people contributing to the collective good within a structured hierarchy.\nIbn Khaldun emphasized how roles and cohesion contribute to a society's strength and longevity.\n4. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831)\nHegel’s Philosophy of Right and his broader dialectical framework discuss how:\n\nA stable society arises from the synthesis of individual freedom and social institutions.\nPeople find their true selves by contributing to a greater whole, especially through family, civil society, and the state.\nFor Hegel, the state is the ultimate realization of freedom and harmony when everyone fulfills their role within its structure.\n5. Alasdair MacIntyre (1929– )\nIn his modern work After Virtue, MacIntyre critiques contemporary individualism and champions a return to Aristotelian virtue ethics:\n\nA society thrives when people pursue their telos (purpose) within communities that share a common moral framework.\nHe emphasizes the importance of traditions and practices that give people meaningful roles within a stable social structure.\nWho Fits Best?\nFrom what you’ve described, Confucius or Ibn Khaldun might resonate most if you’re thinking about structured, cohesive societies based on natural or moral roles. If you're considering a Western tradition with a theological or metaphysical component, Aquinas or Hegel might fit. If you’re looking for a critique of modernity with a return to structured communities, MacIntyre offers a contemporary perspective.\n\n12:18\n\nYou said:\nCan you tell me more about Hegel and Alasdair? Did you have them debate with each other and other philosophers that might disagree with them and try to come up with a clarification of each of their ideas? Because what is Alasdair's idea of telos? What is the purpose? Share a common moral framework. What is that? And what would Charles Taylor say about all of this?\n12:19\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHegel, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Charles Taylor each present rich frameworks for understanding purpose, structure, and moral frameworks in society. Here’s an exploration of their ideas, potential debates, and clarifications:\n\nHegel’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in Hegel:\n\nFor Hegel, the telos (ultimate purpose) of humanity is freedom—not as individual independence, but as the realization of oneself within the context of the whole (family, civil society, and the state).\nHe believed history progresses dialectically, resolving contradictions to achieve greater unity and self-awareness. The state, in its ideal form, is the realization of this telos, where individuals are free because their roles align with the rational structure of society.\nMoral Framework:\n\nHegel argued that morality (individual conscience) must integrate with ethical life (Sittlichkeit), which includes family, civil society, and the state.\nThe state is not oppressive; it embodies rational freedom, where individual purposes align with collective purposes.\nAlasdair MacIntyre’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in MacIntyre:\n\nMacIntyre’s telos for humans is rooted in virtue ethics, drawn from Aristotle. Humans flourish by fulfilling their potential within practices (shared activities with intrinsic goods) and traditions (longstanding communities of meaning).\nTelos is tied to the notion of a “narrative unity of life,” where individuals see their lives as coherent, meaningful stories within the context of a community.\nCommon Moral Framework:\n\nMacIntyre argues that modernity has fragmented moral frameworks, leaving us with conflicting and incoherent moral languages (emotivism).\nHe advocates for a return to traditions (like Aristotelian or Thomistic virtue ethics) that provide shared understandings of the good life and human flourishing.\nDebates Between Hegel and MacIntyre\nOn Telos and Freedom:\n\nHegel: The state is the highest realization of human purpose, harmonizing individual freedom and collective good.\nMacIntyre: Human flourishing is tied to smaller communities and traditions, not an abstract state structure. He might see Hegel’s state as too grandiose or prone to suppressing individual moral traditions.\nOn Moral Frameworks:\n\nHegel: The rationality of ethical life arises organically from history and resolves itself in the state.\nMacIntyre: Moral coherence requires a return to traditions rooted in virtue and practices, not a state-driven rationality.\nCharles Taylor’s Perspective\nAgreement with Hegel:\n\nTaylor draws from Hegel’s ideas of the dialectic and the importance of self-realization through society. For Taylor, identity is formed in dialogue with others, and freedom is realized when individuals find themselves in alignment with the structures of society.\nHe would likely appreciate Hegel’s emphasis on modernity as a space for recognition—the idea that people flourish when their identities and contributions are affirmed by others.\nCritique of MacIntyre:\n\nTaylor shares MacIntyre’s concern about the fragmentation of modern morality but sees more value in the plurality of frameworks. He believes people can navigate between frameworks to construct meaningful lives.\nUnlike MacIntyre, who seeks a return to Aristotelian or Thomistic traditions, Taylor is more open to modern identity’s creative and adaptive possibilities.\nPoints of Contention\nHegel vs. MacIntyre on the Individual and the State:\n\nHegel: The state integrates individual purpose into collective rationality.\nMacIntyre: Large structures like the state erode traditions that are necessary for virtue and flourishing.\nTaylor vs. MacIntyre on Modernity:\n\nTaylor: Modernity offers unique opportunities for identity formation, even within fragmented moral landscapes.\nMacIntyre: Modernity’s fragmentation is a moral crisis, requiring a return to coherent traditions.\nTaylor vs. Hegel on Pluralism:\n\nHegel: History resolves into a unified rational framework (e.g., the modern state).\nTaylor: Modern societies must embrace pluralism and navigate tensions without expecting a final resolution.\nClarifications on Key Terms\nTelos (MacIntyre):\n\nThe telos is human flourishing, achieved through cultivating virtues within a tradition. Flourishing means leading a coherent life where one’s actions align with a meaningful narrative.\nCommon Moral Framework (MacIntyre):\n\nThis framework is rooted in shared traditions and practices. For example, the Aristotelian tradition sees virtues like courage, justice, and generosity as essential for the good life. MacIntyre sees modern individualism as eroding these frameworks.\nRecognition (Taylor):\n\nTaylor emphasizes recognition as key to human flourishing. Societies thrive when people are acknowledged for who they are, which fosters dignity and belonging.\nDebating Across Time\nAristotle might argue that Hegel overemphasizes the state and neglects the importance of smaller-scale communities.\nConfucius would critique MacIntyre for not fully appreciating how rituals and roles (e.g., family) create moral coherence.\nNietzsche would likely reject all three, arguing their views impose constraining moral frameworks instead of fostering true individual creativity.\nSynthesis\nIf these philosophers were to sit down together, the tension might lead to a broader understanding:\n\nHegel would push for the integration of individuals into rational, historical structures.\nMacIntyre would challenge the abstractness of such structures, advocating for local traditions and practices.\nTaylor would mediate, suggesting that modernity’s plurality offers opportunities for dialogue and synthesis rather than rigid returns to tradition.\nThis debate reveals that the \"purpose\" of society might not have a singular answer but depends on balancing freedom, tradition, and dialogue.\n\n12:20\n\nYou said:\nWhat would you say are domestic virtue ethics and Aristotelian virtue ethics and their definition of a good life? And then what is modern kind of European Union or the United Nations good life definition? Like what is the ethic behind that? You know, fundamental human rights and others, but like what are these ideas of the good life?\n12:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nDomestic Virtue Ethics (Confucian or Family-Centered Ethics)\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nDomestic virtue ethics, such as those emphasized in Confucianism or family-centered moral traditions, define the good life as harmonious relationships within a structured family and community system. The foundation is the belief that moral development starts in the family and radiates outward to society.\n\nCore Principles:\nRoles and Hierarchies: Each person has specific roles and duties (e.g., parent, child, sibling) that guide behavior.\nVirtues: Key virtues include filial piety (respect for parents and elders), loyalty, benevolence, and propriety.\nHarmony and Stability: A good life means maintaining balance and fulfilling obligations within relationships, ensuring both personal and collective flourishing.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic is deeply relational and role-based. Individuals find meaning through their responsibilities and contributions to the group, prioritizing stability, respect, and harmony over individual autonomy.\n\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nAristotle’s concept of the good life (eudaimonia, often translated as flourishing) is the full realization of human potential through the cultivation of virtues and rational activity in alignment with one's purpose (telos).\n\nCore Principles:\nVirtues as Habits: The good life requires cultivating virtues like courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom through practice and moderation (the Golden Mean).\nPractical Wisdom (Phronesis): Rationality and moral insight guide actions, enabling individuals to make wise decisions in specific contexts.\nCommunity and Politics: Humans are social beings (zoon politikon), so flourishing occurs within a just political community where individuals contribute to the common good.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic emphasizes individual moral development in harmony with the community. Flourishing is achieved through the active cultivation of virtues that align personal and societal well-being.\n\nModern European Union and United Nations Framework\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nThe good life in modern frameworks, such as those of the European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN), centers on universal human dignity, equality, and the fulfillment of fundamental rights and opportunities. It balances individual freedoms with collective well-being.\n\nCore Principles:\nHuman Rights: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) underpins this ethic, emphasizing freedom, security, education, health, and participation as fundamental.\nEquality and Non-Discrimination: The good life is one where everyone, regardless of background, has equal access to opportunities.\nSustainability and Global Responsibility: Modern frameworks include environmental ethics, emphasizing the right to a healthy planet and intergenerational justice.\nAgency and Self-Determination: Individuals should have autonomy to pursue their goals, provided they do not harm others.\nEthic Behind It:\nThis ethic is rooted in liberalism and cosmopolitanism, focusing on individual freedom, fairness, and global solidarity. It rejects rigid hierarchies and aims to balance rights with collective obligations to create inclusive, sustainable societies.\n\nComparing the Good Life Across Frameworks\nFramework    Focus    Definition of Good Life    Ethic\nDomestic Virtue Ethics    Family and social harmony    Harmonious relationships, fulfilling roles    Relational and duty-bound; prioritizes stability and respect over autonomy.\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics    Virtue cultivation and rationality    Flourishing through virtues and rational activity    Balanced between individual development and societal contribution.\nModern EU/UN Framework    Individual rights and global responsibility    Universal dignity, freedom, and equality    Liberal and cosmopolitan; emphasizes autonomy, fairness, and sustainability.\nTensions and Debates\nIndividual vs. Collective Good:\n\nDomestic and Aristotelian ethics often prioritize the community, while modern frameworks emphasize individual autonomy and rights.\nVirtues vs. Rights:\n\nVirtue ethics sees moral character as central to the good life, while modern frameworks focus on institutional guarantees like rights and freedoms.\nUniversalism vs. Particularism:\n\nModern frameworks are universalist (e.g., all humans have the same rights), while domestic and Aristotelian ethics are more contextual and embedded in specific traditions.\nSustainability and Environment:\n\nThe modern good life includes sustainability, a relatively new focus absent from classical virtue ethics or family-based traditions.\nCharles Taylor’s View on the Good Life\nTaylor, in works like Sources of the Self, argues that modernity fragments moral frameworks, making it harder to define the good life. He suggests:\n\nThe good life arises from authenticity—living in alignment with one’s deeply held values.\nWhile he appreciates the pluralism of modernity, he warns against the flattening of moral horizons (e.g., reducing the good life to materialism or individualism).\nHe might critique the UN/EU framework for focusing on procedural rights without addressing the deeper question of what truly fulfills human beings.\nKey Takeaway\nThe good life is a deeply contested concept that shifts depending on philosophical, cultural, and historical contexts. Each framework—domestic, Aristotelian, and modern—offers a unique vision, with ongoing tensions around autonomy, community, and sustainability. The debate challenges us to consider how to reconcile individual flourishing with collective responsibility.\n\n12:23\n\nYou said:\nIt kind of makes sense to me, the Confucian idea of roles, not necessarily the hierarchies, but we all have roles that we play in the world. And I also like this idea of MacIntyre's idea that stories, right? And that we kind of have our, we're within a culture, right? And so meaning-making needs to connect with a, you know, your individual story and what makes life meaningful for you. But also to like tell the story of the world. And I think that this is an important thing, is like, what is the story of me and what’s my developing and unfolding story of the world and my role in it and these things may help connect with sources of meaning for instance what if you didn’t know about a war and weren’t able to petition your gov to open borders to refugees and bring in a family - that might be incredibly meaningful for you and you’d have to have knowledge of the world to know and know how to do that what about amartya sen how would he respond to all this - The good life, really, it seems like no one really has a very clear idea about what it means to lead and live a good life. I think the idea of authenticity, living in alignment with one's deeply held values, makes sense to me from Taylor. Tensions and debates. Collective good versus individual good. I think it's really important, that tension here. And maybe it's kind of resolved with these stories of the world and stories of the self. Virtues versus rights. Universalism versus particularism. It's definitely very particular because what makes this person's right action in that right moment is definitely related to their self-understanding and understanding of the world. And this idea that there's a moral dimension of grappling with competing values. And I think it's really important to have knowledge of impact. So, let's say there's somebody trying to make a decision about sexual contact. And they have agreements with their partner that this is totally fine for them to have sexual contact outside of their relationship in this polyamorous situation. But they still have a sense that their partner, if they knew, would be hurt. Should they tell them because they have this open policy? Or should they hide what they're doing, leading to some tensions? And how do you know what the right thing to do is in that situation? And you can grapple with it and you can try different ways and you can have different experiences. But you don't know how the other person will respond. And then I kind of feel like there's just the right thing to do and this idea of the most beautiful. And so the good life should be good. And we should kind of be developing an aesthetic taste for our sort of morality. It's like what is not just the good life but what is the beautiful life? And the narrative is how you make it coherent. You talk about, okay, so I'm like this. These are what I really love and value and want to see in the world. And the world is like that. And this is how I am a part of that larger story. And I find my authenticity by realizing that my authenticity is kind of defining myself in a big story. Not just a small story of self but self and world. And that this idea of it kind of definitely connects with this Muslim intuition that like everything is a sign. Everything in the horizons outside of the world is a sign of the most merciful God. And that this most merciful God is telling the most beautiful story through the creation and through existence. And it's really our hands that lead to corruption. And we are oppressing ourselves when we are going against our values. And we do these things for various reasons. There's different forces that block this. This is why like the tawheed element, like this idea of unity is so important. Because this like concept of unity and the way that it's described in the Muslim tradition is ihsan. It's like first you just do the actions. You pray. You fast. You have all of the pillars of Islam. And then iman. You believe these things. That God is writing the most beautiful story in the most perfect book. And that everything is in his total and ultimate control. And his name of al-Rahman, the most merciful, is the thing that encompasses everything. And so our like position, if we really believe these things, we think, okay, well I have free will. And I can either align with the most beautiful story and figure out how does mercy for the worlds, which is what the guide for humanity is supposed to be, the prophet of Islam, Muhammad ﷺ. And so he is a mercy to the worlds. He is our ultimate example. So we should be aspiring to be mercy to the worlds. And so there's the merciful who's created everything. He's given us free will. And he's created destiny. And we are here to be a part of telling that most merciful story and opening the channel inside of us to the light of the most merciful divine God's actions through our submitting of our will to that most beautiful story. Does that make sense? And so we see the world. We understand. We try to be creative in telling our most beautiful component of our story. Like what is our role in this unfolding? A tree as it elegantly traces a path towards the sky and the roots that go in this way searching for water is following the commands of God essentially. And it's following its innate beingness. And this is its fitrah, F-I-T-R-A. And this is how that tree becomes beautiful. Because it is what it is without trying to be anything other than that because it has no free will. It follows its fitrah naturally. And the fitrah is the innate state. And so everyone loves babies. Sure, a baby will cry. But no one is like, it's crying to annoy me. It's crying because. And we lose touch with this ability to just be and to see our emotions and to act and respond in the world. And I think this like spontaneity and this is why there's a relationship with Wu Wei and choiceless action from Taoism. And I think there's the important element though that I'm coming to now maybe for the first time is these like multiple interweaving stories. You can think of them sort of like holograms, right? So a hologram has everything outside and everything inside. And you tell the story, self-consistent, totally about yourself, about how you see someone hurting and you feel moved to go and do something about it. Or you want to create a joyous and loving and harmonious home for your wife. So you go and you bake some bread. And this is a artistic creative act in the world where you try to understand. Like not only do I want to make bread. I want to understand what my wife loves and make that because that will make like more joy and more beauty. And that kind of to me is a story about who I am and how I want to show up in the world and what I am attending to when I'm making choices about my day and my actions. And so like all these frameworks talk about things in a very theoretical way. And one of the nice things about modernity is it kind of like really emphasize these ideas of productivity and to-do lists and turned our days into routines. And we see the machinery of the operations of life more clearly now. But there's a point of intervention where we can pierce through the mundane and touch the spiritual and ethical, moral, artistic process of becoming that leads us to fulfilling the ultimate destiny that would make us the happiest person on earth the day we meet our doom, our death. And that's living who we were meant to be and fulfilling our role in the most beautiful story. And that's a creative process. That's not something you could just pop out of the womb and start doing. That requires like knowledge of self. That requires knowledge of the world. And as these things grow and develop, you see that there's this element of oneness that is really critical. Like you're telling two stories that merge that become one story of a creation of beauty. It's not just like looking within and introspection and looking without and being like, okay, well, the world has problems. Okay, what resources do I have? And like trying to figure out how to solve them. And this also addresses the need for like scalable good, right? You don't have only this like, okay, I'll look within. Don't ask what the world needs. That's what makes you come to life. It's like don't ask what the world. Ask what the world is. Ask what makes you come to life. And then be the most like beautiful, creative person in telling a story that puts all this together into oneness, which is the act of Tawheed. And so I kind of see things through the Islamic frame, but I think that all of these philosophers can kind of agree when we look at it this way. Can you help like align this in a table and show where they agree and where they disagree and what a kind of unified framework for the good life and what actions are, what virtue is, what morality is, what creative ethics are, what beauty is, and what meaning is, and what God is, and what the soul is, and what the body is for all these philosophers. And what the community is and what the roles are for society as well.\n12:23\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThis is a profound synthesis of ideas from philosophy, spirituality, and modern ethical frameworks. I'll attempt to align these perspectives into a unified framework for the good life while addressing the points you raised about virtue, morality, creativity, beauty, meaning, God, the soul, the body, community, and society’s roles.\n\nBelow is a table that captures the key ideas and points of agreement and divergence among the perspectives of Islamic philosophy, Aristotle, MacIntyre, Amartya Sen, Charles Taylor, Confucianism, and modern frameworks (e.g., UN/EU).\n\nCategory    Islamic Philosophy (Tawheed/Ihsan)    Aristotle (Virtue Ethics)    MacIntyre (Virtue & Narrative Ethics)    Amartya Sen (Capabilities Approach)    Charles Taylor (Authenticity & Pluralism)    Confucianism (Role Ethics)    Modern Frameworks (UN/EU Rights)\nGood Life    Aligning with the oneness of God (Tawheed), acting as a channel for mercy and beauty in the world, fulfilling one’s fitrah.    Eudaimonia: Flourishing through cultivating virtues, fulfilling rational potential in community.    Living a coherent narrative within a tradition that integrates personal and collective flourishing.    Expanding freedoms to do and be what one values; ensuring opportunities for well-being and agency.    Living authentically in alignment with deeply held values, connected to community and recognition.    Harmonious relationships and fulfilling one’s roles in the family and society for collective harmony.    Realizing human rights, equality, sustainability, and well-being, balancing freedom with responsibility.\nVirtue    Ihsan: Excellence in action, reflecting God’s mercy and beauty; virtues like justice, generosity, and patience.    Courage, justice, temperance, wisdom, cultivated through the Golden Mean and practical wisdom.    Virtues embedded in cultural traditions, contextualized by narrative meaning and shared practices.    Agency, self-determination, empathy, and capabilities to create meaningful lives.    Virtues emerge through dialogue between individual values and cultural traditions, enabling authenticity.    Filial piety, benevolence, and propriety as relational and role-based virtues.    Respect, fairness, equality, and responsibility toward others and the environment.\nMorality    Submission to God’s will and aligning actions with divine commands for justice and mercy.    Practical reasoning guides moral choices; actions balance individual and collective well-being.    Morality as living well within traditions that give coherent meaning to life.    Morality focuses on enabling individuals to achieve capabilities and freedoms.    Grappling with competing values in pluralistic societies while staying true to personal authenticity.    Moral order arises from fulfilling obligations within familial and societal roles.    Rooted in universal human rights and laws, ensuring freedom, dignity, and justice.\nCreativity    Reflecting divine creativity by acting as a vessel for mercy, beauty, and light in the world.    Creative action lies in aligning one’s potential with virtues to enhance self and community.    Creativity is embedded in traditions, enabling meaningful, flourishing lives.    Creative solutions expand freedoms and address inequities in the world.    Creativity arises from reconciling internal values with external conditions, forging new paths authentically.    Creativity is harmonizing personal actions with the collective good, fostering societal balance.    Innovation drives progress while respecting human dignity and environmental limits.\nBeauty    Living in harmony with the divine story, expressing mercy and unity through actions and creations.    The aesthetic of the good life emerges from the harmony of virtues and rational activity.    Beauty arises from coherence in life’s narrative and the flourishing of self and community.    Beauty is connected to justice and equity, where lives are enriched through freedom and opportunity.    Beauty is in authenticity: living a meaningful and unique life that contributes to collective understanding.    Harmony and balance in relationships and roles create societal beauty.    Beauty is secondary to rights and equality but emerges in equitable, sustainable societies.\nMeaning    Meaning comes from knowing one’s role in the divine story and embodying mercy and unity.    Meaning is rooted in fulfilling one’s purpose (telos) as a rational and social being.    Meaning comes from living a story aligned with one’s community and tradition.    Meaning is tied to the ability to shape one’s life through freedom and opportunity.    Meaning arises through reconciling internal values with external recognition and cultural dialogue.    Meaning emerges from fulfilling roles and responsibilities, contributing to societal harmony.    Meaning is tied to universal human dignity, freedom, and self-determination.\nGod    The ultimate source of mercy, unity, and beauty; creator of the fitrah and the divine story.    Aristotle’s God is the Unmoved Mover, the ultimate cause and aim of all rational activity.    MacIntyre focuses on tradition and virtue but incorporates Aquinas’ view of God as ultimate telos.    Often silent on metaphysics, focusing instead on human flourishing and justice in the material world.    God is a cultural and spiritual horizon shaping individual authenticity and meaning.    Confucianism does not focus on a deity but on Tian (heaven) as the moral order guiding virtuous life.    Secular frameworks avoid God, emphasizing human dignity and universal rights.\nSoul    The soul is the eternal essence, aligning with fitrah and God’s mercy through submission and action.    The rational soul seeks virtue and truth, achieving fulfillment through intellectual activity.    The soul is embedded in a narrative tradition, developing through virtues and shared meaning.    Often left undefined; focuses instead on human dignity and material conditions for flourishing.    The soul is the source of self-expression and authenticity, formed through dialogue and recognition.    The self is relational and defined by roles; emphasis is on virtue and harmony rather than metaphysical soul.    Secular focus on human potential and dignity, avoiding metaphysical definitions of the soul.\nBody    A vessel for enacting mercy, beauty, and worship in the physical world.    The body must be cared for and aligned with rational activity to achieve virtue.    The body is a medium for enacting virtues and fulfilling one’s role in the narrative of life.    The body’s health and freedoms are essential for exercising capabilities and achieving well-being.    The body is part of one’s authentic self, shaped by cultural and personal practices.    The body participates in relational roles, following rituals and fulfilling duties to maintain harmony.    The body has rights to health, safety, and dignity, protected through laws and policies.\nCommunity    The ummah (global Muslim community) fosters collective mercy and responsibility for justice and equity.    Community is essential for flourishing, providing a space for practicing virtues and rationality.    Communities ground traditions that guide individuals in developing virtues and meaning.    Community ensures opportunities and freedoms, enabling collective well-being.    Community is a space of recognition where individuals form identity and meaning.    Community is the foundation of harmony; individuals contribute by fulfilling their roles and duties.    Community ensures equal rights, freedoms, and participation, fostering inclusion and sustainability.\nRoles in Society    Individuals are channels for mercy, contributing to collective beauty and justice in their unique capacities.    Roles align with virtues and rationality, contributing to the common good and flourishing.    Roles are defined by traditions, providing meaning and moral grounding for individuals.    Roles ensure equal opportunity and access to resources, enabling people to thrive.    Roles are self-determined but shaped by recognition within cultural and societal structures.    Roles are relational and hierarchical, contributing to collective harmony and stability.    Roles protect rights and ensure equity, balancing freedoms with societal responsibility.\nUnified Framework for the Good Life\nThe Good Life: The integration of individual and collective flourishing through virtue, freedom, and harmony.\nAction and Virtue: Virtues arise from alignment with one’s inner purpose (fitrah or telos) and outward contributions to the community.\nStory and Meaning: The good life is a coherent narrative where self, community, and the divine or universal story align.\nBeauty and Creativity: Life becomes beautiful when actions reflect inner virtues and contribute to the collective good.\nUnity and Interdependence: All actions, relationships, and creations converge toward a greater oneness, whether divine (Islamic Tawheed) or communal (Confucian harmony, Aristotelian polis).\nThis synthesis ties individual authenticity and agency to the larger story of a beautiful, unified world."

            "extracted_content": "how does this update our diagram and framework? how would these compare and how would you address the model given this perspective: “So I'm trying to operationalize a system that leads with this quote that goes, thoughts lead to actions, actions lead to habits, habits lead to character, and character leads to destiny. And to map it with attentional policies that are about the sources of meaning. So like the thing that we pay attention to and a sentence that describes it. So for instance, moments where there's light-hearted and joyful conversation, or spaces where people can express their colors and creativity, or sunsets where the sky turns many colors. Or I don't know, things like that. Joe Edelman's values framework, because I really think that there's a way of understanding that source of attention and sources of meaning as a connection with the things that make us come alive. And it reminds me, and I'm pairing that with the quote, like, don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive, and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people that have come alive. And I'm working on this assumption that our coming alive comes through our daily actions, our to-do lists, our habits, and what we do on a day-to-day. When we can use that to identify moments where we are either coming alive or not coming alive. And that's what I would like to do with a quick check-in. And when we're not coming alive, there's tension or negative emotions. And we can use the process of all of our emotions are trying to tell us something. And actually, the idea that everything is always talking to us and trying to tell us something. And it's either tension, and that means that there are different things that we're trying to attend to at the same time that are incommensurate. We want to attend to our baby's laugh and presence with us at the same time as we're trying to attend to crafting a philosophy of action and growth that is philosophically rigorous and intellectually stimulating and creative and fun. And what I'm doing right now, my baby's over there, but I have these two tensions. And so how can we do these things together? And I guess I could talk it out to my baby and pretend that he can understand, actually bring him into the process. And so that creative, productive framing of how can I find a higher level action or things to attend to that will be able to address the underlying conflicts in the sources of meaning. And I call the other thing pressures of doing. So neither internal or external. So they could be norms or other things that are not really on the conscious level, just things that you do because that's what people do. I got a job, or I do this, or I do that. And I got to get to work. Why do you gotta, gotta, gotta? And so it's like the shoulds and the want-tos in our lives, I think, is another way of thinking about these things. When you have a bunch of shoulds, you can think that they're probably a bunch of instrumental things or things that are unconscious or things that are beyond our choice and intention. So the idea is to move more of our actions into the place of intentionality and into a place where we can actually be connected to our sources of meaning and flow. And even if they're like sleep or things that are very practical with good intentions, you can always find a way of connecting these things. And I think that's a really important thing to do because so many people are just like living on autopilot. And so I think there's something about this that I'm really trying to figure out to see if I have everything, if I have full coverage onto the human condition, or if I'm missing some fundamental things about other reasons why people might get stuck or not live the way that they want to live. And if I'm missing things that would be important to add in this framework, or is this useful enough? And then what are the important parts to save, right? Should we only save the sources of attention for all of the meaningful things, or should we save the story? Does the story actually have some special sauce that's gonna be important? Because in the future, I just want to save the minimal subset of things that's gonna be really helpful for the person and not like absolutely everything, like the pressures and the tensions and how they relate and like every single bit of resource that the person has from like a laptop to a friend that they can call and then what is their relationship? And then what is the, you know, that gets to be too huge. I'm trying to come up with like a very streamlined, very elegant, high leverage thing that actually puts the mirror pointing at the person and asks them questions about those fundamental resources like relationships and others, but doesn't even have to necessarily say the word relationships. Like what has helped you in the past? Think of stories, situations, contexts, like large abstract words like that so that people can reflect and be like, oh, you know what? I really loved it when I had the support of my friends on jobs because I'm just way better in a pair programming process. And then we can derive like new sources of meaning and new ways for that person to live their values. And I'm really just need some questions and some digging in to figure out if I'm on the right track or if I need some help getting this structured better.”\n05:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt sounds like you're trying to design a system that aligns daily actions with deeper sources of meaning, using intentionality to foster a more meaningful life. The quote you're referencing serves as a great starting point, mapping out how thoughts lead to destiny.\n\nTo operationalize this, you could start by identifying key \"sources of meaning\" for individuals, such as moments that spark joy or creativity. Reflect on how these sources can be incorporated into daily actions and habits.\n\nYour framework could use reflective questions to prompt self-awareness:\n\nWhat activities make you feel most alive?\nWhen do you notice a sense of flow or joy?\nHow can you incorporate these moments into your daily life?\nTo address the tensions between \"shoulds\" and \"wants,\" you might emphasize:\n\nShifting actions from autopilot (external pressures) to intentionality (internal meaning).\nIdentifying and minimizing unconscious influences.\nStreamlining this approach involves:\n\nFocusing on high-leverage questions that reveal core values and patterns.\nEncouraging actions aligned with those values.\nIt sounds like you're exploring a powerful method to bring awareness to our daily choices, which is incredibly valuable. Keep refining your questions to ensure they resonate and inspire meaningful action!\n\n11:58\n\nYou said:\n“Okay, yeah, that sounds good, except I was looking to see if this is comprehensive. I'm wondering if, like, a coach or a psychologist may be able to tell me that I'm actually missing some fundamental elements that are critical for this, and we're trying to get people to basically come alive and be the best for themselves and for others. And I first of all want to, like, know, is it true that the world needs people that have come alive? Like, is that really all that you need, and what does it mean to come alive, you know, I think, to be sources of meaning is a way to really find what lights you up, and you'll have more energy, you'll have more commitments, you'll have more attention and focus and draw to do these things, but who knows if that will actually lead to a more possible and sustainable world. I think it's related to Plato's Golden Mean. Maybe there's a way of, like, really understanding the philosophical rigor here, and whether or not I'm just doing, like, a small thing that might help a little bit, or if I'm doing something that's actually transformational for individuals and for the planet, because I'm trying to let go of running a social enterprise accelerator and thinking I know what a better future looks like, and incentivizing entrepreneurs that work in the social space to reduce CO2 emissions or employ refugees, and instead thinking of, like, what if we just help people see who they are, what the world is, and feel really deeply about what makes them come to life and what they want to contribute in an authentic way, in this way reducing burnout and actually increasing authenticity and making the world more diverse, unique, and whole, because people are actually being what they are, like a tree that produces apples is going to be producing apples, and the worm that eats those apples is going to eat those apples, and the bird that eats the worm and the apples is going to poop some seeds somewhere and plant new trees and kind of, like, become this ecosystemic thing, but you don't have to think about the long consequences of your actions and monitor impact and measures. Instead, you have to think really deeply about what is coming around you right now in your field of vision, in your awareness, and as you grow and as you learn and as the world is getting more and more deeply interconnected, we will see refugees. We will see the burning that's happening in California. People will be doing the science, because there are people who come alive doing the science, and they're going to be telling us these stories, the journalists who are coming live, telling us the stories of how the science related to CO2 is related to the burning, and we will feel this care and this passion, and the people that live closest to the fires will tell the stories about how to best help those and will maybe transform how they work, and we don't need to kind of use governments and pressure and taxes and incentivize solar panels and tell people to go green and blame and judge, and instead, there's a different way, and I think this just might be a philosophically rigorous and psychologically sound way of helping more people come alive, and, you know, like, let's just keep this whole thing about sustainability, right? Like, consume less, right? Because they'll be more content. They'll actually connect their work with meaning, and what would happen if this planet had more content people on it? Like, it would be very interesting to do an economic study of contentedness.”\n11:58\n03:21\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour vision of helping people come alive and connect with their deeper sources of meaning is indeed comprehensive and philosophically rich. You're tapping into a powerful idea that aligns with the concept of eudaimonia, or flourishing, which is central to many philosophical traditions, including Aristotle's.\n\nThe idea that the world needs more people who are alive—engaged, passionate, and living authentically—resonates deeply. This state of being can lead to more sustainable and compassionate actions, creating a ripple effect that benefits society and the planet. It aligns well with the idea of contentment and reducing unnecessary consumption.\n\nTo ensure comprehensiveness, it might be helpful to consider:\n\nDiverse Perspectives: Include inputs from coaches, psychologists, and different cultural frameworks to ensure it resonates broadly.\nPractical Implementation: Develop tools or practices that help people identify and sustain these sources of meaning in their daily lives.\nMeasuring Impact: While it's less about rigid metrics, consider ways to observe and reflect on the transformation in individuals and communities.\nThe shift from focusing on specific outcomes (like reducing CO2) to nurturing authenticity and connection might be more sustainable and transformative. It's a beautiful and ambitious vision, and your approach could indeed be a profound way to foster individual and collective well-being. It's worth exploring further, perhaps through pilot programs or small groups to test and refine your ideas. Keep digging into these questions, and you might find a truly transformative path.\n\n12:03\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think there's something here as well, and I'd love to hear you explain Aristotle's eudaimonia concept and the concept of the golden mean and how they could relate. And also the idea that I have that is not very clear in how it could be true or how it could be false. Identify a critic of these ideas and a proponent of these ideas and have them discussed back before coming to a conclusion. And the idea that I want them to discuss is that they have a possibility to have a scalable, transformative world that is able to address these kind of thorny, interconnected VUCA problems by just paying attention to their context and their situation and their feelings and what makes them come to life and their sources of meaning. There's one way that I described, which is consentedness, that also reduces consumption, which is the core factor leading to the emissions of greenhouse gases and all of this stuff. And the other one is this idea that, you know, people will actually care. They'll love their planet. There's some people that will come to life nurturing nature, regenerating forests, and hearing these stories can be inspiring to us. The story of the Patagonia founder, the story of the person who planted a million trees, or the person who does these regenerative agroforestry projects, or feeds their communities with an urban farm in Detroit. And someone else might be inspired and love that and find their sources of meaning through this. But I don't want to direct people towards that. I want to direct people towards that process. And I guess the big element is this element of trust. And that would mean that, like, do I trust that the world is sort of self-consistent and that there are signals enough in the right places that if people are paying attention, that the signals will transform into truth that they see if they are, like, I don't know. It requires this kind of open curiosity and exploration of the world and, like, a little bit of an understanding of what's happening. Let's imagine that we didn't freak people out about climate change and we just told people to go live, you know, and see. And people would be like, oh, look at this degraded ecosystem. Like, it hurts me to see because next door I've seen these things that are beautiful, like, wonderful, green, lush places. Like, why isn't this like that? And then asking these questions and, like, feeling and being sensitive and then responding. I feel like there needs to be an element of education, but this element of exposure and seeing and maybe some people can really understand systems thinking and they have the capacity and the cognitive development to be able to do that. Some people are just kids and they need to be, you know, like, grown and be able to see and feel and do, see the world, see the truth, feel, care, find their sources of meaning in the way that they action and do something beautiful, do something about it. And then we need to empower people with resources, right? So, I'm really wondering if this is enough and, like, if that quote, like, I want you to ask me a couple of questions to help me discover for myself. And then maybe also give me a bunch of critics that would say that this is wrong. And why is it wrong? Rigorously and philosophically. Like, who out there in academia, who out there in, like, the lived experience, maybe, like, indigenous peoples or others or people that think that we have to really understand the world before fixing it and that we can measure change as important, like, all the people that are working in governments and such, trying to create incentives for people to have a life that is more sustainable and, yeah, come back to me with a list of questions and arguments that kind of contradict this idea that don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do that. And, you know, maybe there's two elements, right? It's like, ask what makes you come alive and go do that. In a way, that creates harmony. I don't know, like, does there need to be an addition to that quote or not? Is it good enough on its own if we trust the hearts of people?”\n12:03\n04:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAristotle's eudaimonia, often translated as \"flourishing\" or \"the good life,\" is about living in a way that fulfills one's potential and aligns with virtues. The Golden Mean is about balance—finding a middle ground between extremes, like courage being the mean between recklessness and cowardice.\n\nThese concepts can relate to your idea by emphasizing balance in living a meaningful life, one that’s in harmony with oneself and the world.\n\nTo explore your idea's strengths and weaknesses, here's a dialogue:\n\nProponent: \"Focusing on what makes us come alive can lead to genuine engagement and positive action. When people are deeply connected to their passions and sources of meaning, they naturally contribute in ways that benefit themselves and the world. Contentment can reduce consumption, and nurturing what brings joy can lead to sustainability.\"\n\nCritic: \"But what if individual passions don't align with collective good? Not everyone’s 'coming alive' might lead to positive outcomes, and focusing solely on personal joy could overlook systemic issues. We also need structural changes and collective action to address broader problems.\"\n\nProponent: \"True, but if individuals are more content and connected to their purpose, they might naturally work towards collective good. It's about fostering a deeper awareness and responsibility, which can lead to structural changes from a place of authenticity.\"\n\nCritic: \"Yet we can't ignore the need for external structures and incentives. Trusting that everyone will 'come alive' in a way that benefits the world might be idealistic. We need a balance of individual transformation and societal structures to ensure sustainable outcomes.\"\n\nTo sum up, your idea has the potential to be transformative but may need to be complemented with structural supports. The balance of individual authenticity and collective action could be the key.\n\nAs you explore this further, consider questions like:\n\nHow can we ensure individual passions align with collective good?\nWhat role do societal structures play in supporting or hindering this process?\nHow can we measure the impact of this shift in perspective on broader societal goals?\nYour approach is promising, blending philosophical depth with practical applications. Keep refining it, and it could indeed become a transformative force.\n\n12:09\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, you know, you're right. Like, we can't trust that everyone's purpose and things that make them come alive will be the thing that will bring them to social and collective positive change. I mean, there are sociopaths, and so maybe what we need to do is include that data about how many people in the world are sociopaths.”\n12:09\n00:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful\n\n12:10\n\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n12:10\n00:01\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful consideration. Including data on different motivations and behaviors can help create a more robust system. It's important to recognize that while many people may find positive, socially beneficial purposes, there are also those who might not.\n\nBy acknowledging this diversity, you can design mechanisms that guide people towards constructive and positive actions, balancing individual growth with collective well-being. It\n\n12:10\n\nYou said:\nI know that one of the ancient philosophers had some of these ideas that, you know, people should find their place and the structure becomes a whole. I thought it was Plato, and I thought it had something to do with golden or middle. Can't really remember. Can you help me figure out what that was?\n12:10\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou might be thinking of Plato's idea of the \"ideal city\" in his work The Republic, or Aristotle's concept of the \"Golden Mean.\" Here's how they align with what you're describing:\n\nPlato and the Ideal City (The Republic)\nPlato argued that a harmonious society is one where everyone \"finds their place\" based on their natural abilities and virtues. He divided society into three classes:\n\nRulers (philosopher-kings): Govern based on wisdom.\nGuardians (soldiers): Protect based on courage.\nProducers (farmers, artisans, etc.): Provide goods and services based on their practical skills.\nIn this structure, individuals contribute to the whole according to their role, creating a just and unified society. Plato emphasized that justice arises when everyone fulfills their role without interfering in others' roles.\n\nAristotle's Golden Mean\nAristotle, a student of Plato, developed the idea of the Golden Mean, which is about finding balance or moderation between extremes. For example:\n\nCourage lies between recklessness and cowardice.\nGenerosity lies between wastefulness and stinginess.\nWhile the Golden Mean primarily applies to personal virtues, Aristotle also emphasized the importance of individuals living in accordance with their nature and contributing to the \"polis\" (community) for a flourishing society.\n\nConnecting the Dots\nIf you're thinking about \"people finding their place\" and a \"structure becoming a whole,\" Plato's ideal city seems to fit. If the \"golden\" part feels important, Aristotle's Golden Mean might resonate. Both philosophers explored how individuals and communities achieve harmony through balance and fulfilling their natural roles.\n\n12:18\n\nYou said:\nIs there another philosopher from antiquity or the, you know, the last couple of 2,000 years that talks about this strong, stable, and structured society when people were who they were meant to be, something like that? Who might be the philosopher that fits that category?\n12:18\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, several philosophers across antiquity and the last 2,000 years have explored the idea of a strong, stable, and structured society based on people fulfilling their purpose or role. Here are a few key figures who might align with what you're describing:\n\nConfucius (551–479 BCE) Confucius emphasized the importance of li (ritual and social order) and ren (virtue and benevolence) in creating a harmonious society. He argued that:\nA stable society depends on everyone fulfilling their roles within relationships (parent-child, ruler-subject, etc.).\nPeople thrive when they live in alignment with their moral duties and cultivate virtue.\nThis Confucian vision is about balance within a structured society, where each person contributes based on their position and responsibilities.\n2. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)\nAquinas built on Aristotle’s philosophy within a Christian framework. He argued that:\n\nSociety is structured around a divine hierarchy, with everyone having a God-given role.\nPeople fulfill their purpose through their roles, which ultimately lead to the common good and spiritual flourishing.\nAquinas saw harmony and stability as arising when individuals live according to both their natural and divine purpose.\n3. Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406)\nThe Islamic philosopher and historian Ibn Khaldun proposed a cyclical theory of societal rise and decline. His key ideas include:\n\nSocieties are held together by asabiyyah (social cohesion or solidarity).\nStability and prosperity depend on people contributing to the collective good within a structured hierarchy.\nIbn Khaldun emphasized how roles and cohesion contribute to a society's strength and longevity.\n4. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831)\nHegel’s Philosophy of Right and his broader dialectical framework discuss how:\n\nA stable society arises from the synthesis of individual freedom and social institutions.\nPeople find their true selves by contributing to a greater whole, especially through family, civil society, and the state.\nFor Hegel, the state is the ultimate realization of freedom and harmony when everyone fulfills their role within its structure.\n5. Alasdair MacIntyre (1929– )\nIn his modern work After Virtue, MacIntyre critiques contemporary individualism and champions a return to Aristotelian virtue ethics:\n\nA society thrives when people pursue their telos (purpose) within communities that share a common moral framework.\nHe emphasizes the importance of traditions and practices that give people meaningful roles within a stable social structure.\nWho Fits Best?\nFrom what you’ve described, Confucius or Ibn Khaldun might resonate most if you’re thinking about structured, cohesive societies based on natural or moral roles. If you're considering a Western tradition with a theological or metaphysical component, Aquinas or Hegel might fit. If you’re looking for a critique of modernity with a return to structured communities, MacIntyre offers a contemporary perspective.\n\n12:18\n\nYou said:\nCan you tell me more about Hegel and Alasdair? Did you have them debate with each other and other philosophers that might disagree with them and try to come up with a clarification of each of their ideas? Because what is Alasdair's idea of telos? What is the purpose? Share a common moral framework. What is that? And what would Charles Taylor say about all of this?\n12:19\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHegel, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Charles Taylor each present rich frameworks for understanding purpose, structure, and moral frameworks in society. Here’s an exploration of their ideas, potential debates, and clarifications:\n\nHegel’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in Hegel:\n\nFor Hegel, the telos (ultimate purpose) of humanity is freedom—not as individual independence, but as the realization of oneself within the context of the whole (family, civil society, and the state).\nHe believed history progresses dialectically, resolving contradictions to achieve greater unity and self-awareness. The state, in its ideal form, is the realization of this telos, where individuals are free because their roles align with the rational structure of society.\nMoral Framework:\n\nHegel argued that morality (individual conscience) must integrate with ethical life (Sittlichkeit), which includes family, civil society, and the state.\nThe state is not oppressive; it embodies rational freedom, where individual purposes align with collective purposes.\nAlasdair MacIntyre’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in MacIntyre:\n\nMacIntyre’s telos for humans is rooted in virtue ethics, drawn from Aristotle. Humans flourish by fulfilling their potential within practices (shared activities with intrinsic goods) and traditions (longstanding communities of meaning).\nTelos is tied to the notion of a “narrative unity of life,” where individuals see their lives as coherent, meaningful stories within the context of a community.\nCommon Moral Framework:\n\nMacIntyre argues that modernity has fragmented moral frameworks, leaving us with conflicting and incoherent moral languages (emotivism).\nHe advocates for a return to traditions (like Aristotelian or Thomistic virtue ethics) that provide shared understandings of the good life and human flourishing.\nDebates Between Hegel and MacIntyre\nOn Telos and Freedom:\n\nHegel: The state is the highest realization of human purpose, harmonizing individual freedom and collective good.\nMacIntyre: Human flourishing is tied to smaller communities and traditions, not an abstract state structure. He might see Hegel’s state as too grandiose or prone to suppressing individual moral traditions.\nOn Moral Frameworks:\n\nHegel: The rationality of ethical life arises organically from history and resolves itself in the state.\nMacIntyre: Moral coherence requires a return to traditions rooted in virtue and practices, not a state-driven rationality.\nCharles Taylor’s Perspective\nAgreement with Hegel:\n\nTaylor draws from Hegel’s ideas of the dialectic and the importance of self-realization through society. For Taylor, identity is formed in dialogue with others, and freedom is realized when individuals find themselves in alignment with the structures of society.\nHe would likely appreciate Hegel’s emphasis on modernity as a space for recognition—the idea that people flourish when their identities and contributions are affirmed by others.\nCritique of MacIntyre:\n\nTaylor shares MacIntyre’s concern about the fragmentation of modern morality but sees more value in the plurality of frameworks. He believes people can navigate between frameworks to construct meaningful lives.\nUnlike MacIntyre, who seeks a return to Aristotelian or Thomistic traditions, Taylor is more open to modern identity’s creative and adaptive possibilities.\nPoints of Contention\nHegel vs. MacIntyre on the Individual and the State:\n\nHegel: The state integrates individual purpose into collective rationality.\nMacIntyre: Large structures like the state erode traditions that are necessary for virtue and flourishing.\nTaylor vs. MacIntyre on Modernity:\n\nTaylor: Modernity offers unique opportunities for identity formation, even within fragmented moral landscapes.\nMacIntyre: Modernity’s fragmentation is a moral crisis, requiring a return to coherent traditions.\nTaylor vs. Hegel on Pluralism:\n\nHegel: History resolves into a unified rational framework (e.g., the modern state).\nTaylor: Modern societies must embrace pluralism and navigate tensions without expecting a final resolution.\nClarifications on Key Terms\nTelos (MacIntyre):\n\nThe telos is human flourishing, achieved through cultivating virtues within a tradition. Flourishing means leading a coherent life where one’s actions align with a meaningful narrative.\nCommon Moral Framework (MacIntyre):\n\nThis framework is rooted in shared traditions and practices. For example, the Aristotelian tradition sees virtues like courage, justice, and generosity as essential for the good life. MacIntyre sees modern individualism as eroding these frameworks.\nRecognition (Taylor):\n\nTaylor emphasizes recognition as key to human flourishing. Societies thrive when people are acknowledged for who they are, which fosters dignity and belonging.\nDebating Across Time\nAristotle might argue that Hegel overemphasizes the state and neglects the importance of smaller-scale communities.\nConfucius would critique MacIntyre for not fully appreciating how rituals and roles (e.g., family) create moral coherence.\nNietzsche would likely reject all three, arguing their views impose constraining moral frameworks instead of fostering true individual creativity.\nSynthesis\nIf these philosophers were to sit down together, the tension might lead to a broader understanding:\n\nHegel would push for the integration of individuals into rational, historical structures.\nMacIntyre would challenge the abstractness of such structures, advocating for local traditions and practices.\nTaylor would mediate, suggesting that modernity’s plurality offers opportunities for dialogue and synthesis rather than rigid returns to tradition.\nThis debate reveals that the \"purpose\" of society might not have a singular answer but depends on balancing freedom, tradition, and dialogue.\n\n12:20\n\nYou said:\nWhat would you say are domestic virtue ethics and Aristotelian virtue ethics and their definition of a good life? And then what is modern kind of European Union or the United Nations good life definition? Like what is the ethic behind that? You know, fundamental human rights and others, but like what are these ideas of the good life?\n12:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nDomestic Virtue Ethics (Confucian or Family-Centered Ethics)\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nDomestic virtue ethics, such as those emphasized in Confucianism or family-centered moral traditions, define the good life as harmonious relationships within a structured family and community system. The foundation is the belief that moral development starts in the family and radiates outward to society.\n\nCore Principles:\nRoles and Hierarchies: Each person has specific roles and duties (e.g., parent, child, sibling) that guide behavior.\nVirtues: Key virtues include filial piety (respect for parents and elders), loyalty, benevolence, and propriety.\nHarmony and Stability: A good life means maintaining balance and fulfilling obligations within relationships, ensuring both personal and collective flourishing.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic is deeply relational and role-based. Individuals find meaning through their responsibilities and contributions to the group, prioritizing stability, respect, and harmony over individual autonomy.\n\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nAristotle’s concept of the good life (eudaimonia, often translated as flourishing) is the full realization of human potential through the cultivation of virtues and rational activity in alignment with one's purpose (telos).\n\nCore Principles:\nVirtues as Habits: The good life requires cultivating virtues like courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom through practice and moderation (the Golden Mean).\nPractical Wisdom (Phronesis): Rationality and moral insight guide actions, enabling individuals to make wise decisions in specific contexts.\nCommunity and Politics: Humans are social beings (zoon politikon), so flourishing occurs within a just political community where individuals contribute to the common good.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic emphasizes individual moral development in harmony with the community. Flourishing is achieved through the active cultivation of virtues that align personal and societal well-being.\n\nModern European Union and United Nations Framework\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nThe good life in modern frameworks, such as those of the European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN), centers on universal human dignity, equality, and the fulfillment of fundamental rights and opportunities. It balances individual freedoms with collective well-being.\n\nCore Principles:\nHuman Rights: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) underpins this ethic, emphasizing freedom, security, education, health, and participation as fundamental.\nEquality and Non-Discrimination: The good life is one where everyone, regardless of background, has equal access to opportunities.\nSustainability and Global Responsibility: Modern frameworks include environmental ethics, emphasizing the right to a healthy planet and intergenerational justice.\nAgency and Self-Determination: Individuals should have autonomy to pursue their goals, provided they do not harm others.\nEthic Behind It:\nThis ethic is rooted in liberalism and cosmopolitanism, focusing on individual freedom, fairness, and global solidarity. It rejects rigid hierarchies and aims to balance rights with collective obligations to create inclusive, sustainable societies.\n\nComparing the Good Life Across Frameworks\nFramework    Focus    Definition of Good Life    Ethic\nDomestic Virtue Ethics    Family and social harmony    Harmonious relationships, fulfilling roles    Relational and duty-bound; prioritizes stability and respect over autonomy.\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics    Virtue cultivation and rationality    Flourishing through virtues and rational activity    Balanced between individual development and societal contribution.\nModern EU/UN Framework    Individual rights and global responsibility    Universal dignity, freedom, and equality    Liberal and cosmopolitan; emphasizes autonomy, fairness, and sustainability.\nTensions and Debates\nIndividual vs. Collective Good:\n\nDomestic and Aristotelian ethics often prioritize the community, while modern frameworks emphasize individual autonomy and rights.\nVirtues vs. Rights:\n\nVirtue ethics sees moral character as central to the good life, while modern frameworks focus on institutional guarantees like rights and freedoms.\nUniversalism vs. Particularism:\n\nModern frameworks are universalist (e.g., all humans have the same rights), while domestic and Aristotelian ethics are more contextual and embedded in specific traditions.\nSustainability and Environment:\n\nThe modern good life includes sustainability, a relatively new focus absent from classical virtue ethics or family-based traditions.\nCharles Taylor’s View on the Good Life\nTaylor, in works like Sources of the Self, argues that modernity fragments moral frameworks, making it harder to define the good life. He suggests:\n\nThe good life arises from authenticity—living in alignment with one’s deeply held values.\nWhile he appreciates the pluralism of modernity, he warns against the flattening of moral horizons (e.g., reducing the good life to materialism or individualism).\nHe might critique the UN/EU framework for focusing on procedural rights without addressing the deeper question of what truly fulfills human beings.\nKey Takeaway\nThe good life is a deeply contested concept that shifts depending on philosophical, cultural, and historical contexts. Each framework—domestic, Aristotelian, and modern—offers a unique vision, with ongoing tensions around autonomy, community, and sustainability. The debate challenges us to consider how to reconcile individual flourishing with collective responsibility.\n\n12:23\n\nYou said:\nIt kind of makes sense to me, the Confucian idea of roles, not necessarily the hierarchies, but we all have roles that we play in the world. And I also like this idea of MacIntyre's idea that stories, right? And that we kind of have our, we're within a culture, right? And so meaning-making needs to connect with a, you know, your individual story and what makes life meaningful for you. But also to like tell the story of the world. And I think that this is an important thing, is like, what is the story of me and what’s my developing and unfolding story of the world and my role in it and these things may help connect with sources of meaning for instance what if you didn’t know about a war and weren’t able to petition your gov to open borders to refugees and bring in a family - that might be incredibly meaningful for you and you’d have to have knowledge of the world to know and know how to do that what about amartya sen how would he respond to all this - The good life, really, it seems like no one really has a very clear idea about what it means to lead and live a good life. I think the idea of authenticity, living in alignment with one's deeply held values, makes sense to me from Taylor. Tensions and debates. Collective good versus individual good. I think it's really important, that tension here. And maybe it's kind of resolved with these stories of the world and stories of the self. Virtues versus rights. Universalism versus particularism. It's definitely very particular because what makes this person's right action in that right moment is definitely related to their self-understanding and understanding of the world. And this idea that there's a moral dimension of grappling with competing values. And I think it's really important to have knowledge of impact. So, let's say there's somebody trying to make a decision about sexual contact. And they have agreements with their partner that this is totally fine for them to have sexual contact outside of their relationship in this polyamorous situation. But they still have a sense that their partner, if they knew, would be hurt. Should they tell them because they have this open policy? Or should they hide what they're doing, leading to some tensions? And how do you know what the right thing to do is in that situation? And you can grapple with it and you can try different ways and you can have different experiences. But you don't know how the other person will respond. And then I kind of feel like there's just the right thing to do and this idea of the most beautiful. And so the good life should be good. And we should kind of be developing an aesthetic taste for our sort of morality. It's like what is not just the good life but what is the beautiful life? And the narrative is how you make it coherent. You talk about, okay, so I'm like this. These are what I really love and value and want to see in the world. And the world is like that. And this is how I am a part of that larger story. And I find my authenticity by realizing that my authenticity is kind of defining myself in a big story. Not just a small story of self but self and world. And that this idea of it kind of definitely connects with this Muslim intuition that like everything is a sign. Everything in the horizons outside of the world is a sign of the most merciful God. And that this most merciful God is telling the most beautiful story through the creation and through existence. And it's really our hands that lead to corruption. And we are oppressing ourselves when we are going against our values. And we do these things for various reasons. There's different forces that block this. This is why like the tawheed element, like this idea of unity is so important. Because this like concept of unity and the way that it's described in the Muslim tradition is ihsan. It's like first you just do the actions. You pray. You fast. You have all of the pillars of Islam. And then iman. You believe these things. That God is writing the most beautiful story in the most perfect book. And that everything is in his total and ultimate control. And his name of al-Rahman, the most merciful, is the thing that encompasses everything. And so our like position, if we really believe these things, we think, okay, well I have free will. And I can either align with the most beautiful story and figure out how does mercy for the worlds, which is what the guide for humanity is supposed to be, the prophet of Islam, Muhammad ﷺ. And so he is a mercy to the worlds. He is our ultimate example. So we should be aspiring to be mercy to the worlds. And so there's the merciful who's created everything. He's given us free will. And he's created destiny. And we are here to be a part of telling that most merciful story and opening the channel inside of us to the light of the most merciful divine God's actions through our submitting of our will to that most beautiful story. Does that make sense? And so we see the world. We understand. We try to be creative in telling our most beautiful component of our story. Like what is our role in this unfolding? A tree as it elegantly traces a path towards the sky and the roots that go in this way searching for water is following the commands of God essentially. And it's following its innate beingness. And this is its fitrah, F-I-T-R-A. And this is how that tree becomes beautiful. Because it is what it is without trying to be anything other than that because it has no free will. It follows its fitrah naturally. And the fitrah is the innate state. And so everyone loves babies. Sure, a baby will cry. But no one is like, it's crying to annoy me. It's crying because. And we lose touch with this ability to just be and to see our emotions and to act and respond in the world. And I think this like spontaneity and this is why there's a relationship with Wu Wei and choiceless action from Taoism. And I think there's the important element though that I'm coming to now maybe for the first time is these like multiple interweaving stories. You can think of them sort of like holograms, right? So a hologram has everything outside and everything inside. And you tell the story, self-consistent, totally about yourself, about how you see someone hurting and you feel moved to go and do something about it. Or you want to create a joyous and loving and harmonious home for your wife. So you go and you bake some bread. And this is a artistic creative act in the world where you try to understand. Like not only do I want to make bread. I want to understand what my wife loves and make that because that will make like more joy and more beauty. And that kind of to me is a story about who I am and how I want to show up in the world and what I am attending to when I'm making choices about my day and my actions. And so like all these frameworks talk about things in a very theoretical way. And one of the nice things about modernity is it kind of like really emphasize these ideas of productivity and to-do lists and turned our days into routines. And we see the machinery of the operations of life more clearly now. But there's a point of intervention where we can pierce through the mundane and touch the spiritual and ethical, moral, artistic process of becoming that leads us to fulfilling the ultimate destiny that would make us the happiest person on earth the day we meet our doom, our death. And that's living who we were meant to be and fulfilling our role in the most beautiful story. And that's a creative process. That's not something you could just pop out of the womb and start doing. That requires like knowledge of self. That requires knowledge of the world. And as these things grow and develop, you see that there's this element of oneness that is really critical. Like you're telling two stories that merge that become one story of a creation of beauty. It's not just like looking within and introspection and looking without and being like, okay, well, the world has problems. Okay, what resources do I have? And like trying to figure out how to solve them. And this also addresses the need for like scalable good, right? You don't have only this like, okay, I'll look within. Don't ask what the world needs. That's what makes you come to life. It's like don't ask what the world. Ask what the world is. Ask what makes you come to life. And then be the most like beautiful, creative person in telling a story that puts all this together into oneness, which is the act of Tawheed. And so I kind of see things through the Islamic frame, but I think that all of these philosophers can kind of agree when we look at it this way. Can you help like align this in a table and show where they agree and where they disagree and what a kind of unified framework for the good life and what actions are, what virtue is, what morality is, what creative ethics are, what beauty is, and what meaning is, and what God is, and what the soul is, and what the body is for all these philosophers. And what the community is and what the roles are for society as well.\n12:23\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThis is a profound synthesis of ideas from philosophy, spirituality, and modern ethical frameworks. I'll attempt to align these perspectives into a unified framework for the good life while addressing the points you raised about virtue, morality, creativity, beauty, meaning, God, the soul, the body, community, and society’s roles.\n\nBelow is a table that captures the key ideas and points of agreement and divergence among the perspectives of Islamic philosophy, Aristotle, MacIntyre, Amartya Sen, Charles Taylor, Confucianism, and modern frameworks (e.g., UN/EU).\n\nCategory    Islamic Philosophy (Tawheed/Ihsan)    Aristotle (Virtue Ethics)    MacIntyre (Virtue & Narrative Ethics)    Amartya Sen (Capabilities Approach)    Charles Taylor (Authenticity & Pluralism)    Confucianism (Role Ethics)    Modern Frameworks (UN/EU Rights)\nGood Life    Aligning with the oneness of God (Tawheed), acting as a channel for mercy and beauty in the world, fulfilling one’s fitrah.    Eudaimonia: Flourishing through cultivating virtues, fulfilling rational potential in community.    Living a coherent narrative within a tradition that integrates personal and collective flourishing.    Expanding freedoms to do and be what one values; ensuring opportunities for well-being and agency.    Living authentically in alignment with deeply held values, connected to community and recognition.    Harmonious relationships and fulfilling one’s roles in the family and society for collective harmony.    Realizing human rights, equality, sustainability, and well-being, balancing freedom with responsibility.\nVirtue    Ihsan: Excellence in action, reflecting God’s mercy and beauty; virtues like justice, generosity, and patience.    Courage, justice, temperance, wisdom, cultivated through the Golden Mean and practical wisdom.    Virtues embedded in cultural traditions, contextualized by narrative meaning and shared practices.    Agency, self-determination, empathy, and capabilities to create meaningful lives.    Virtues emerge through dialogue between individual values and cultural traditions, enabling authenticity.    Filial piety, benevolence, and propriety as relational and role-based virtues.    Respect, fairness, equality, and responsibility toward others and the environment.\nMorality    Submission to God’s will and aligning actions with divine commands for justice and mercy.    Practical reasoning guides moral choices; actions balance individual and collective well-being.    Morality as living well within traditions that give coherent meaning to life.    Morality focuses on enabling individuals to achieve capabilities and freedoms.    Grappling with competing values in pluralistic societies while staying true to personal authenticity.    Moral order arises from fulfilling obligations within familial and societal roles.    Rooted in universal human rights and laws, ensuring freedom, dignity, and justice.\nCreativity    Reflecting divine creativity by acting as a vessel for mercy, beauty, and light in the world.    Creative action lies in aligning one’s potential with virtues to enhance self and community.    Creativity is embedded in traditions, enabling meaningful, flourishing lives.    Creative solutions expand freedoms and address inequities in the world.    Creativity arises from reconciling internal values with external conditions, forging new paths authentically.    Creativity is harmonizing personal actions with the collective good, fostering societal balance.    Innovation drives progress while respecting human dignity and environmental limits.\nBeauty    Living in harmony with the divine story, expressing mercy and unity through actions and creations.    The aesthetic of the good life emerges from the harmony of virtues and rational activity.    Beauty arises from coherence in life’s narrative and the flourishing of self and community.    Beauty is connected to justice and equity, where lives are enriched through freedom and opportunity.    Beauty is in authenticity: living a meaningful and unique life that contributes to collective understanding.    Harmony and balance in relationships and roles create societal beauty.    Beauty is secondary to rights and equality but emerges in equitable, sustainable societies.\nMeaning    Meaning comes from knowing one’s role in the divine story and embodying mercy and unity.    Meaning is rooted in fulfilling one’s purpose (telos) as a rational and social being.    Meaning comes from living a story aligned with one’s community and tradition.    Meaning is tied to the ability to shape one’s life through freedom and opportunity.    Meaning arises through reconciling internal values with external recognition and cultural dialogue.    Meaning emerges from fulfilling roles and responsibilities, contributing to societal harmony.    Meaning is tied to universal human dignity, freedom, and self-determination.\nGod    The ultimate source of mercy, unity, and beauty; creator of the fitrah and the divine story.    Aristotle’s God is the Unmoved Mover, the ultimate cause and aim of all rational activity.    MacIntyre focuses on tradition and virtue but incorporates Aquinas’ view of God as ultimate telos.    Often silent on metaphysics, focusing instead on human flourishing and justice in the material world.    God is a cultural and spiritual horizon shaping individual authenticity and meaning.    Confucianism does not focus on a deity but on Tian (heaven) as the moral order guiding virtuous life.    Secular frameworks avoid God, emphasizing human dignity and universal rights.\nSoul    The soul is the eternal essence, aligning with fitrah and God’s mercy through submission and action.    The rational soul seeks virtue and truth, achieving fulfillment through intellectual activity.    The soul is embedded in a narrative tradition, developing through virtues and shared meaning.    Often left undefined; focuses instead on human dignity and material conditions for flourishing.    The soul is the source of self-expression and authenticity, formed through dialogue and recognition.    The self is relational and defined by roles; emphasis is on virtue and harmony rather than metaphysical soul.    Secular focus on human potential and dignity, avoiding metaphysical definitions of the soul.\nBody    A vessel for enacting mercy, beauty, and worship in the physical world.    The body must be cared for and aligned with rational activity to achieve virtue.    The body is a medium for enacting virtues and fulfilling one’s role in the narrative of life.    The body’s health and freedoms are essential for exercising capabilities and achieving well-being.    The body is part of one’s authentic self, shaped by cultural and personal practices.    The body participates in relational roles, following rituals and fulfilling duties to maintain harmony.    The body has rights to health, safety, and dignity, protected through laws and policies.\nCommunity    The ummah (global Muslim community) fosters collective mercy and responsibility for justice and equity.    Community is essential for flourishing, providing a space for practicing virtues and rationality.    Communities ground traditions that guide individuals in developing virtues and meaning.    Community ensures opportunities and freedoms, enabling collective well-being.    Community is a space of recognition where individuals form identity and meaning.    Community is the foundation of harmony; individuals contribute by fulfilling their roles and duties.    Community ensures equal rights, freedoms, and participation, fostering inclusion and sustainability.\nRoles in Society    Individuals are channels for mercy, contributing to collective beauty and justice in their unique capacities.    Roles align with virtues and rationality, contributing to the common good and flourishing.    Roles are defined by traditions, providing meaning and moral grounding for individuals.    Roles ensure equal opportunity and access to resources, enabling people to thrive.    Roles are self-determined but shaped by recognition within cultural and societal structures.    Roles are relational and hierarchical, contributing to collective harmony and stability.    Roles protect rights and ensure equity, balancing freedoms with societal responsibility.\nUnified Framework for the Good Life\nThe Good Life: The integration of individual and collective flourishing through virtue, freedom, and harmony.\nAction and Virtue: Virtues arise from alignment with one’s inner purpose (fitrah or telos) and outward contributions to the community.\nStory and Meaning: The good life is a coherent narrative where self, community, and the divine or universal story align.\nBeauty and Creativity: Life becomes beautiful when actions reflect inner virtues and contribute to the collective good.\nUnity and Interdependence: All actions, relationships, and creations converge toward a greater oneness, whether divine (Islamic Tawheed) or communal (Confucian harmony, Aristotelian polis).\nThis synthesis ties individual authenticity and agency to the larger story of a beautiful, unified world."

            "extracted_content": "What Islam Offers to Modern Self-Help: An Islamic Paradigm of Psychology\n Dr.Abdallah Rothman, Tue 5 Jumada Al Oula 1441AH 31-12-2019AD  Spiritual Productivity  16 minutes\n\nFacebook\n481\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nIslam offers not only a theological framework within which we can position ourselves in relation to God, but it also offers a holistic map for how to navigate the human experience on a path of development of the self, or soul. While we may understand and believe that the Qur’an and Sunnah provide all of the guidance we need in life, many do not realize just how much is contained within this deen. With all of the influence of global trends toward secularism and the predominantly secular societies we live in, it can be easy to be persuaded by the assumption of a binary between religion and science. The institution of academia has fought hard to convince the world that the social sciences are in fact sciences rather than philosophical paradigms rooted in epistemology. In turn, the Muslim ummah has collectively bought into this story and forgotten its rich tradition of ‘ilm an-nafs (knowledge of the soul).\n\nWhen you read about personal and professional development from just about any perspective or approach, the concepts and ideas are rooted in psychology. Modern psychology and its offshoots of personal development and self-help trends offer a lot of pertinent ideas and resources that all people, including the Muslim community, need desperately as societies become increasingly globalized and disconnected from the ancient wisdom that was inherent in more traditional, local communities and holistic lifestyles. But what these strands of pop psychology also bring with them are foundational assumptions about human nature, some of which are not aligned with the values and principles of an Islamic paradigm, which are baked into the cake. Without realizing it and/or without being fully aware of the repercussions of such philosophical and paradigmatic differences we can open ourselves up to hidden, often unintentional misguidance that can lead to a spiritual crisis, or worse, distance from our inner connection to Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He).\n\n'There exists within the Islamic tradition an entire “science” of the soul or self which is completely aligned with and based upon the Qur’an and Sunnah and which offers practical solutions to everyday struggles faced by people in the modern world.' @RothmanAbdallah\nClick to Tweet\nWhile this could be seen as a dilemma of whether to benefit from the good that these personal development resources have to offer and balance the potential pitfalls that they may present the Muslim trying to walk the path of Islam, fortunately, such a dilemma is unnecessary. There exists within the Islamic tradition an entire “science” of the soul or self which is completely aligned with and based upon the Qur’an and Sunnah and which offers practical solutions to everyday struggles faced by people in the modern world. In fact, this science of the soul is so advanced and comprehensive that it stands to offer entirely new insights to the popular field of self-improvement that even non-Muslims can benefit from. This is the legacy of the turath al Islam (path of Islam) as exemplified by our Beloved Prophet, peace be upon him, and is the birthright and heritage of every Muslim. Unfortunately, this knowledge has been all but lost and forgotten in the collective consciousness of today’s ummah. In this article, we want to share a glimpse of this turath and its impact on modern life and self-help.\n\nThe inherent psychology within Islam\nOur perspective of Islam can often be one dimensional, especially if we have not done our own deep exploration of the teachings within the context of traditional Islamic spiritual education (tarbiyyah). As many followers of a religion, whether accepting that of their parents’ beliefs and rituals or individually choosing to follow the path set out by religious teachings, there is a tendency to see religion as a set of prescriptions that one must follow in order to be in God’s good graces. Religion has become institutionalized to the point that we make edifices out of the religion as a thing in and of itself, rather than understanding it as a path of guidance to follow in order to grow developmentally as a human being. What this can amount to is a relationship to the religion that is more transactional than it is transformational. We do what we have understood we are supposed to do with a belief that certain behaviors and actions or inactions will result in us being in God’s good grace, without necessarily transforming the state of our being or doing any work from the inside out. However, the Qur’an is replete with messages of the need for personal transformation and accountability within our innermost selves, as it says:\n\n“[…] Allah does not change a people until they change what is in themselves” (Qur’an 13: 11)\n\nWhat does it mean to change what is in oneself, what does that amount to, and how does one do this? These are all questions that could be assumed to be confined within the domain of the field of psychology, and yet the answers are all detailed within the Islamic tradition. What we have come to know as the academic discipline of psychology, a word which literally means the study of the soul, was not traditionally conceptualized as such in Islamic teachings because the study of the soul is embedded within the content of the entire Qur’an and Sunnah. The knowledge of the soul and its development is spread throughout the many branches of knowledge within the Islamic tradition, as there was previously no distinction or separation between the following of the religion and the individual effort to work on oneself in the process of inner transformation. We have become disconnected from the inherently holistic worldview which Islam posits and have adopted a disaggregated way of thinking about life and ourselves to the point that it is now necessary to present the Islamic knowledge of the soul in a condensed form that lends parity to that of modern psychology. Thus while our predecessors may not have needed to use terms such as “psychology” to distinguish such endeavors from other parts of the deen, it now becomes imperative for us to understand and define “Islamic psychology”.\n\n'What does it mean to change what is in oneself, what does that amount to, and how does one do this? These are all questions that could be assumed to be confined within the domain of the field of psychology, and yet the answers are all detailed within the Islamic tradition.' @RothmanAbdallah\nClick to Tweet\nAn Islamic perspective of the self\nUnlike popular conceptions within modern psychology and the dominant discourse of self-help and self-improvement which identifies the notion of the self as being centralized in the mind and in thought, an Islamic perspective of self includes multiple aspects of the whole being. Cartesian philosophy, which posits the notion of “I think therefore I am” has pervaded contemporary thought to the extent that most conceptions regarding the self within popular psychology are framed around the mind as the central location of human identity. We see this represented graphically in just about any poster or textbook that references psychology being accompanied by a picture of the brain, and by the name of the clinical field being termed “Mental Health”.\n\n\n\nOften we see this brain or mind pictured in isolation, seemingly severed from the rest of its body, as similarly there is a tendency to see the body only as a housing for the mind as the core identity of the person. An Islamic perspective, conversely, necessarily posits that the human is a whole, integrated spiritual being which includes the body, mind, heart, and spirit.\n\n'An Islamic perspective, conversely, necessarily posits that the human is a whole, integrated spiritual being which includes the body, mind, heart, and spirit.' @RothmanAbdallah\nClick to Tweet\nBased on the writings and teachings of our learned scholars who have maintained an unbroken chain of transmission in how to interpret the Qur’an and understand the Prophetic tradition, we learn that within the Islamic ontological paradigm the true identity of a person is their soul, which is one integrated spiritual being, including the body. Thus an important distinction in Islamic psychology is that the central identity of the person is the soul, rather than the more narrowly defined notion of the self which is primarily conceived of as the construction of identity-based on personality and memories, which are confined to the temporal world, or dunya. A fundamental aspect of the Islamic conception of the soul is that the starting point in the soul’s journey is not limited to the moment of birth, but includes pre-existence. This goes back to the point of origin of all of the souls when they were created and Allah asked them “Am I not your Lord?” (Qur’an 7: 172). As the Qur’an narrates every single soul that will ever be created was there in that moment and replied: “Indeed we witness” (Qur’an 7: 172).\n\n“And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam – from their loins – their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes, we witness.” [This] – lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, “Indeed, we were of this unaware.” (Qur’an 7: 172)\n\nThis critical moment in the trajectory of every human soul distinguishes the human identity as a soul that is in a state of witnessing that Allah is One and that they (each human being) are servants of the Lord. In other words, it is within our true nature to be dependent on the One God for subsistence and to recognize that Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) is in control of everything, a very different picture than the self that is in control of its own destiny as many popular narratives go in the self-help industry.\n\nFitrah: The soul’s true identity\nThe soul’s trajectory becomes a challenge or a test the minute they enter into the dunya in human form as that innate witnessing of their true nature becomes veiled to them, thus beginning the journey back to this witnessing. As Islam narrates, at the end of the temporary state of human life in the dunya all souls will again be made aware of Allah’s omnipotence as the veil is lifted from us, but what each soul has done in terms of their striving to uncover that witnessing in the time they had in the dunya will determine their relative state in the next life. Thus, an Islamic paradigm of psychology is not limited to this life, as contemporary psychology is, but rather includes both pre-natal and post mortem realities. The concept of fitrah, the innate natural disposition of the human being as this soul from its point of origin as a witness of tawhid (Oneness of God) is crucial to a conception of psychology from an Islamic worldview as it fundamentally defines both the picture of healthy functioning and a mechanism for understanding unhealthy functioning. Thus the definition of what we call mental health and wellbeing is connected to the spiritual state of the person, not just their relative level of comfort or happiness in the dunya.\n\nThe optimal state of the person then is to be in alignment with fitrah and to uncover that true nature of witnessing which is constantly being veiled and challenged by multiple factors within this life. When we are in a state of submission to the will of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) we are in our optimal state of functioning and aligned with our fitrah. However, this is a difficult state to maintain as we have several factors impacting our ability to be in the state of remembrance of that true nature which is necessary to maintain optimal functioning. In addition to the external factors in the dunya that distract us from the remembrance of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He), there is a constant struggle inside of us that we must engage in that amounts to a battleground in our soul. In order to be better equipped for the battle, it is important that we understand the terrain of the soul and how to navigate it.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe structure of the soul\nThe soul in its pure state, before being covered and veiled from Allah’s reality, has the spark of the Divine breath that was breathed into us, known as the ruh. The ruh, or spirit, is the pure aspect of the human soul that is always there and which cannot be corrupted or misaligned. It is this pure and good aspect of our soul that allows us to always come back to the witnessing of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and provides the human being with a direct connection to Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He). While the ruh cannot be corrupted it most certainly can get covered over to the point that we are unaware and disconnected from this part of our soul. When we came into this world our souls were manifested in a physical form, in our bodies, in which we have the nafs, or lower self- the part of us that is bound to our temporal existence here in the world. This is the same self that most of the contemporary psychology deals with exclusively and is what we tend to be most familiar with, as it is how we experience ourselves in the world. This is the part of our self that likes what it likes, has desires and sways us in one direction or another. While it is not bad in and of itself, it has a tendency to lead us away from our fitrah and into a state of ghafla, or forgetfulness of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He), because it is the part of ourselves that is oriented to the dunya and lives purely in this realm.\n\nThe ruh and the nafs can be conceived of as being two opposite poles of which we are constantly being pulled between in the battleground of our soul. We are spiritual beings having physical experiences here in this life and we are pulled between identifying and living in this seemingly separate reality where we are in control of our actions, through our free will, and our innate nature of knowing that we come from Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and are dependent on Him for everything. The struggle between these two poles is essentially the manifestation of the paradox of experiencing duality in the temporal world while possessing an innate sense of the reality of Oneness (tawhid). Our work here in this life, and therefore our work in our personal and professional development, is to stay engaged in this struggle to constantly strive toward the remembrance of our fitrah to unlock or uncover our true potential as servants of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and the akhira as our end, rather than servants of our nafs and the dunya as our end. The central crux of where this battle takes place and what determines our relative outcome is located in the qalb, or heart, which, in an Islamic paradigm, is the center of the self/soul.\n\nThe word qalb in Arabic is a linguistic root that indicates turning one way or another. The word taqalab means “to turn”. So the function of the heart is that it can turn, either toward the ruh, or toward the nafs. The extent to which we are consciously able to turn our hearts toward the ruh and thus toward Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) is determined by several factors that cloud, block or impede our ability to do so. When we have unresolved emotional trauma from our experiences in life, whether real or perceived, it can manifest as blocks in our heart that further veil us from being able to witness Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and turn to our higher nature. What we would normally conceive of as psychological imbalances are therefore not only cognitive but can be traced down deeper into our hearts, our qalb, where certain experiences have essential knocked us out of alignment with our fitrah and put our system out of balance. In addition to these internal manifestations of forces that pull us away from witnessing Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and submitting to His tawhid, we also have external factors that are inherent in the dunya reality which distract us and pull us toward our nafs, or lower self, when we are in a state of an-nafs al amarah, or the soul that incites to evil. But here the evil can simply be the evil of forgetting our true nature and being subsumed in the illusion of individuation or self-direction.\n\nSelf-development as the development of the soul\nThe work of self-improvement or personal development is the work of constantly staying engaged in the effort to uncover the blocks on the heart, essentially cleaning the heart, and striving and struggling to stay in remembrance of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) amidst the distractions and downward pulls of the dunya. One aspect of the structure of our souls that can help us in this struggle is the aql, which can be conceived of as the cognitive function, but which is a more Divinely connected kind of reasoning. In the Islamic model of the soul, the aql is not understood as the central driving aspect of the self but is actually better understood as a function of the qalb. In addition to the normal kind of logical reasoning that we attribute to the mind, the qalb has the ability to perceive and to see things as they are. The form of the word aql that is used in the Qur’an is an active verb y’aqiluna and it is used as a descriptor of a function of the qalb, so that the heart has the ability to perceive. It is in using this ability to perceive that the qalb possesses that we can effectively turn our hearts away from the veils of the dunya which result in a state of ghafla, and turn it toward Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and the akhira, accessing through the point of Divine connection within us, the ruh.\n\nWe experience different qualities or characteristics of our soul depending on our relative position in the battleground of our soul. When we are subsumed by the covering on our heart and are in a state of an-nafs al ammarah, we can manifest character qualities that are destructive, such as anger, jealousy, and envy; these are called the muhlikat, or destroyers. And when we are engaged in the struggle of the jihad an-nafs (struggle of the self), attempting to reign in our lower tendencies toward individuation and self-direction, we are in a state of an-nafs al lawwamah, or the self-reproaching soul, where we take ourselves to account and make an effort to doing the work of turning our hearts. This can involve a process of thadhib al akhlaq, or the refinement of character, where through self-awareness we consciously try to change the muhlikat and attempt to emulate good character traits such as courage and wisdom and justice, called munjiyat, or saviors and were exemplified in the perfected character of the Prophet subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He). These manifestations of muhlikat, or negative character, are signs of where we need to do the work on ourselves in our process of personal development with the goal of aligning with fitrah and evolving to our higher self, or the next best version of our self. When we have moments of success in this process we can experience the soul in a state of peace, which is the an-nafs al mutma’inah, or the soul at rest. While it is rare to fully achieve this state, we can get glimpses of it that keeps us motivated to do the work of striving toward that next best version, having more frequent experiences of the state of the soul in an-nafs al mutma’inah. This is the goal of personal development in an Islamic paradigm and there exists within the Islamic tradition a whole host of tools and guidance in the pursuit of the purification of the heart and soul.\n\nAn Islamic model of the soul\n\n\nClick to download the full-sized image\nThe Islamic model of the soul presented here was developed as a result of the input of 18 scholars with expertise in various branches of knowledge within the Islamic tradition, the details of which are reported in Rothman and Coyle’s (2018) report of the research findings. According to this model, the human soul has an innately pure and good nature, fitrah, that comes from and is connected to God but that becomes covered over and forgotten as a natural part of life in the dunya. Throughout its life in the dunya, within the soul, there exists a dynamic interplay of conflicting forces that affect the psychological state of the person and determine relative levels of alignment or misalignment with fitrah (this process is represented by the purple elements in the middle of the model).\n\nThe qalb, which is the spiritual center of the person, and where the faculty of intellect is located as the aql, has the potential to turn in either of two directions which shapes the relative, transient outcome of this conflict. It can turn toward the lower impulses of the nafs and become further misaligned with fitrah by the influences of the dunya and shaytan (satan), resulting in increased negative characteristics of the muhlikat and a state of ghafla, (this process is represented by the red elements toward the bottom half of the model). Or it can turn toward the higher, Godly nature of the ruh with the remembrance of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and the akhirah (afterlife), resulting in increased positive characteristics of the munjiyat, and come more in alignment with the soul’s state of fitrah (this process is represented by the blue elements toward the top half of the model).\n\nThe relative state of the soul in relation to either of these two poles at any one time is articulated in three distinct stages of the soul’s development throughout life in the dunya, namely: an-nafs al ammarah bil su’, an-nafs al lawwama, and an-nafs al mutma’inah. The model posits that the soul has an inherent inclination toward growth and an upward trajectory in relation to this model, due to its primordial nature of knowing God, and that the Islamic tradition, as guided by the Qur’an and Sunnah, encourages and maps out a path for the human being to pursue this trajectory. This is demonstrated in the description of processes along the path that act as mechanisms for exerting effort in the dynamic interplay within the soul as it struggles between the two opposing forces, namely; jihad an-nafs, tahdhib al-akhlaq, and tazkiyat an-nafs.\n\nImplications for Personal and Professional Development\nIf we locate our identity within our soul rather than just our self, or the persona that we project in our life, we have the opportunity to take personal transformation to a whole new level. Breaking through the barriers and limitations of our mind and mental worlds is often a critical and necessary step in unlocking our potential and getting to that next best version of our self. However, there are still limitations to our growth if we only conceive of and interact with the cognitive aspect. As the Islamic model posits, the cognitive aspect is one part of a whole, and by recognizing and opening to a more holistic vision of the self, that of the soul, we can access our deeper inner reality and grow in a more profound way.\n\nBy adopting an approach to personal development that is informed and guided by the Islamic model of the soul, we have an opportunity to unlock the secrets of the meaning of life and integrate our religious belief system and worldview with our daily life struggle. In fact, this is the necessary pathway to both deepening our understanding of and relationship to Islam and truly advancing our psychospiritual development. This involves not only reorienting our approach to the deen of Islam to be that of a path of self-development but reorienting our notion of self to be one that is centered in the heart.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam (peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him) said, “there is a piece of flesh in the body and when it is sound the whole body is sound and when it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt and indeed that is the heart”[Sahih Al-Bukhari]\n\nWhile this certainly has implications for physical health and the physical organ of the heart, our learned scholars teach us that the main intention in this statement was in explaining the nature of our spiritual heart as the center of the human being. The Qur’an tells us that our hearts have the ability to reason and perceive and it is only when the heart is polished that a person can truly see things “as they are”. And yet we rarely operate from a place that is centered in the heart in our orientation to our life in the dunya. We suffer from the nature of the plight of the human being in this life which is that we perceive ourselves as self-directed, individual units who are in control of our own destiny.\n\nHow can we possibly work toward achievement and productivity in our lives if we believe that we are not in control? This is the fundamental dilemma that philosophers and critics of religion have debated, and is the same paradox that many Muslims often do not find satisfactory answers to. How do we balance our free will and self-determination with a belief in qadr (destiny)? Self-help guidance often says that we need to have an internal locus of control in order to master our self and take control of our personal development. And yet deeply embedded within the Islamic paradigm and the worldview of a Muslim is that we have an external locus of control, that Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) is the One who is ultimately in control of our outcome. The secret to success in this endeavor of development as a Muslim is to embrace both of these realities, rather than choosing one, it is to embrace the paradox, by which we can witness tawhid (Oneness of Allah)."

            "extracted_content": "Abstract\nMany fields (social choice, welfare economics, recommender\nsystems) assume people express what benefits them via\ntheir ‘revealed preferences.’ Revealed preferences have well-\ndocumented problems when used this way, but are hard to\ndisplace in these fields because, as an information source,\nthey are simple, universally applicable, robust, and high-\nresolution. In order to compete, other information sources\n(about participants’ values, capabilities and functionings,\netc) would need to match this. I present a conception of\nvalues as attention policies resulting from constitutive judge-\nments, and use it to build an alternative preference relation,\nMeaningful Choice, which retains many desirable features\nof revealed preference.\nValues, Preferences, Meaningful Choice∗\nJoe Edelman†\n6 August 2021 — draft\nAs I go, I’ll build up a schematic representation of an in-\nterview structure with which an agent’s values could be col-\nlected, and a choice assessed to see if it was expressive of\nthose values.\nMy goal here is to make it clear what I’m suggesting: what\nquestions could be asked, and what answers might suﬀice to\nshow that an agent has this value or that, or that a revealed\npreference was a meaningful choice.\nI am not suggesting that these interviews can be used to col-\nlect data at the scale needed for welfare calculations, social\nchoice mechanisms, or recommender systems. That practi-\ncal question is beyond my scope here.\nIntroduction\nIn his 1938 paper introducing revealed preference, Samuel-\nson1 warned:\nI should like to state my personal opinion that\nnothing said here… touches upon at any point the\nproblem of welfare economics, except in the sense\nof revealing the confusion in the traditional theory\nof these distinct subjects.\nSimilar sentiments followed, in Arrow,2 Sen,3 Anderson,4\netc. As an information basis for welfare, optimality, social\nchoice, etc, revealed preference has been much critiqued.\nAll the same, it’s hard to see how to move away from it, with-\nout paternalism: if people know best for their own lives—\nshouldn’t we trust their choices as the final proof of their\nintentions? How else can we avoid imposing “better values”\nfrom above?\nOne way to respond is to say that people do know best, and\nhave wise values, but that their revealed preferences aren’t\nthe last word on those values. But to establish this, you’d\nwant another source of information on people’s values—one\nthat retains much of the resolution, robustness, universal\napplicability, and democratic simplicity of preference.\nI’ll develop such an information source here, by taking two\n‘steps back’ from revealed preference, widening the infor-\nmation collected. Then I’ll argue that my new source cor-\nresponds with one definition of “values” used in common\nspeech. Finally, I’ll show how this new source can be used\nin social choice and welfare calculations.\nPreferences\nA rich literature covers how revealed preferences—which,\nwhen summed up, are called engagement metrics—lead us\nastray. You can often get people to choose something with-\nout serving their real interests: you can misinform them, or\nleverage their misplaced hopes.\nOr, you can make it so people need your thing for what\nonce was possible without it: they need your car to get to\nwork, your social media account to find a job, your dress to\nsocialize with their friends, etc.\nMore broadly, you can manufacture social circumstances\nwhere people choose your thing to “keep up with the Jone-\nses,” to signal allegiance with their tribe, or because they’ve\nlost the ability to coordinate a real solution.5\nIn some cases, the person will know their choice doesn’t ex-\npress their true interests—that they are bucking to external\npressure, caught in the system, or setting aside their goals\nto conform to a social rule.6 In other cases, options have\nbeen limited or biased behind our backs.\nGiven these problems, why does revealed preference still\nplay a role in notions of benefit and measures of optimality?\nIt has huge advantages as an information source: in the\nresolution and robustness of the data provided, its near-\nuniversal applicability, and the democratic simplicity of its\ncollection:\n• Preferences say fine-grained things how about each of\nus wants to live, informed by our local situations and\npriorities.\n• Preferences get at what we choose in the final analysis,\nour real, battle-tested priorities, not just what we say\nwe want.\n∗Thanks to B. Gabbai, A. Morris, A. Ovadya, J. Stray, & F. Noriega\n†School for Social Design joe.edelman@gmail.com\n1“A Note on the Pure Theory of Consumer's Behaviour.”\n2Social Choice and Individual Values.\n3“Rational Fools.”\n4“Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Philosophy.”\n5See discussions of the prisoner’s dilemma in e.g., Sen, “Behaviour\nand the Concept of Preference”; Anderson, “Symposium on Amartya\nSen’s Philosophy.”\n6See Sen, “Rational Fools”; Anderson, Value in Ethics and Eco-\nnomics on ‘commitment.’\n1\n• Preferences work in many domains of life, and represent\nall-things-considered judgements, combining morality,\nprudence, whims, etc.\n• Finally, those who aren’t introspective or eloquent can\nstill express a preference. And preferences leave simple-\nto-understand, verifiable trails: purchase histories, vot-\ning records, etc.\nAttentional Policies\nI’ll try to address the problems with preference, holding on\nto these benefits. To do so, I want to take two ‘steps back.’\nThe first step is to widen the conception of choice to include\noption set formation.\nA revealed preference takes the options as given. As other\nauthors have pointed out,7 this doesn’t fully reflect how\nchoice works.\nConsider my choice, with colleagues, to say something witty.\nAt 𝑡1, I choose to say that in particular (over staying silent,\nor saying my second-place quip). But, at some earlier point\n𝑡0, I decided to invest my attention in finding witty things\nto say. I’ve tried witty phrases on in my mind, and tested\nsituations for witty reframings.\nAt 𝑡0, I made a much bigger choice–I adopted8 an atten-\ntional policy of ‘looking for witty quips and reframes.’ This\nis how I assembled the option set for my choice at 𝑡1.\nI think this earlier choice, at 𝑡0, reveals more about me than\nthe latter one. Indeed, these attentional policies (APs)\nmight account for much of what’s called my “personality”:\nWhen making friends, am I cautious or bold? When consid-\nering a purchase, is my focus on price, quality, or durabil-\nity? When speaking, do I try to be witty, precise, or down\nto earth? These may not just be “character traits” I was\nborn with, but policies I adopted, which work together for\nmy way of life.9\nCollecting an agent’s APs is part of my proposal to im-\nprove the information basis of welfare, social choice, and\nrecommenders. How could that work? You could use an\ninteractive survey to collect the agent’s common contexts\n(socializing, at work, in diﬀicult conversations), and have\nthem pick what they attend to most in each.10\nIf they claim to have AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐, you could verify that\nwith followup questions: First, you could ask them about\nrecent moments in 𝑐, and what options they’ve found using\n𝑎. Someone with a policy of vulnerability should be able\nto cough up various opportunities for vulnerability, recently\nconsidered; some taken, some not.\n7Smaldino and Richerson, “The Origins of Options.”\n8I adopt APs (just like I make plans, adopt heuristics, comply\nwith norms, follow through with intentions) because my bounded ra-\ntionality and social needs make it expedient. (Bratman, Intention,\nPlans, and Practical Reason; Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Ratio-\nnal Choice”; Taylor, The Language Animal)\n9This characterization of an identity as composed of APs shares\nsomething with Anderson, “Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Philoso-\nphy”; and Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n10Social attestations, also, could be a source of AP information:\nsomeone who is widely admired for their wit likely has an AP about\nit. Behavioral data may also work: if someone shops by price or by\nquality, that may show up in purchase or click data. (Using, perhaps,\napproaches like Chang, Making Comparisons Count; or Levi, Hard\nChoices)\nAdditionally, that person will also know when exactly vul-\nnerability is called for, and when something else takes the\nfore. I don’t try to be vulnerable when giving directions to\na stranger, or with my dad. Generally, someone with 𝑎 in\n𝑐 will have detailed information about the shape of 𝑐.\nFigure 1: Verifying APs\nSupposing we collected an agent’s APs. How would that\ncompare with revealed preference data, in terms of resolu-\ntion, robustness, universality, and democratic simplicity?\nLike preferences, APs are informed by our local situations\nand priorities, and say fine-grained things about how we\nwant to live. Indeed, they have a higher resolution than\nI’ve let on so far: an AP about ‘honesty’ or ‘vulnerability’\nis always short for a more specific policy, like “attend to\nwhat I feel about each thing we discuss, and let my feeling\nshow,” or “attend to false impressions a listener may get\nfrom my statements, and head them off with a disclaimer.”\nThat is: having honesty as a policy requires a substantive\ninterpretation of honesty, and these differ from person to\nperson.\nAPs are battle-tested. I wish I could craft my words to\nsimultaneously be kind, honest, tactful, humble, and inspir-\ning. I wish I could, at the same moment, be precise in\nmy speech, aware how each word lands, aware of my own\nfeelings; transparent, calm, and centered; passionate; physi-\ncally graceful, like a dancer. But APs compete for my atten-\ntion. So, my choice to look for witty things to say crowds\nout many other options.\nLike preferences, APs are applicable across all domains in\nlife—the moral, the self-interested, etc, and apply to many\nkinds of contexts.\nBut, they score worse on democratic simplicity than re-\nvealed preference. And, for now, it’s unclear how an agent’s\nAPs would provide a substitute for revealed preference. I’ll\nget to that.\nConstitutive Judgement\nMy second ‘step back’ considers the kind of judgement an\nagent makes, when they decide to adopt an AP. Look at\nthese three cases:\n(1) I watch the road while driving. I don’t want to crash.\n(2) I’m careful with my speech at work. My boss fires\nanyone who speaks imprecisely.\n2\n(3) I’ve decided to be more honest with friends. I recently\nopened up to a friend about a struggle I’m having.\nSince then, the relationship feels more intimate, and\nstronger; it’s easier for me to think about what to say;\nmy friend is unexpectedly helpful.\nIn all three examples, the agent notes some benefits of adopt-\ning an AP 𝑎 in a context 𝑐—benefits like staying alive, keep-\ning my job, and having helpful friends. And in each case,\nthis leads to a decision to adopt it.\nBut, in the first two examples, those benefits come together\nto make the case that doing 𝑎 in 𝑐 is functional, necessary,\nprudent, or expedient. The judgement is based on expected\ncosts and benefits, much as a rational choice theorist would\nhope. I’ll call this an instrumental judgement.\nIn (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much\nlarger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of\ngood relationships11, or at least naturally goes together with\nthem. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part\nof any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I\nwant to be—not just that it’s functional in achieving certain\nends. It’s a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a\nclaim about cause and effect.\nI’ll call this a constitutive judgement. To make one, we\nask ourselves questions like: are Xs impossible without Ys?\nAre Xs without Ys in some way lesser? Are there kinds of\nwholeness that emerge only when an X has a Y? Note: the\nevidence that goes into these questions looks a lot like costs\nand benefits (additional kinds of wholeness, etc)! So the\nraw materials for this judgement are similar, but instead of\nbuilding an expected value, we build a more general conclu-\nsion.\nWhy do we make constitutive judgements, instead of doing\na cost-benefit analysis for everything? Other authors have\nmarked out a role for constitutive judgements in moral rea-\nsoning,12 higher-order desires,13 self-understanding,14 and\nidentifying natural kinds,15 but there’s also a case to be\nmade from bounded rationality:16 constitutive judgements\nare cognitively eﬀicient. Instead of asking each time we have\nan X, whether we should also have an Y, we ask up-front if\nXs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our\nXs without considering each case.\nAnyways, both kinds of judgement can have errors, and\nare subject to reconsideration. Instrumental judgements\nare more delicate, because they depend on a more-or-less\ncomplete accounting of costs, benefits, and eﬀicacy. For\nconstitutive judgements, you don’t need such a complete\naccounting: if the benefits you’ve already noticed line up\nnicely, you can take them as evidence of a synergy or whole-\nness. You’ll reconsider your judgement only if you start to\nthink you got the overall pattern wrong.\nThis gives us a way to tell APs resulting from a constitu-\ntive judgements (CAPs) from those adopted instrumentally\n(IAPs). Say an agent uses AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐.\n11Good relationships for this agent, at least.\n12Rawls, A Theory of Justice.\n13Taylor, “4 What Is Human Agency?”\n14Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n15Boyd, “How to Be a Moral Realist.”\n16Following Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice”; Gib-\nson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems; and Bratman,\nIntention, Plans, and Practical Reason.\nFirst, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\nSecond, do the given reasons seem to capture her full ra-\ntionale? If so, it’s likely an IAP. To test this, ask her how\nshe’d feel if they were taken out of consideration (e.g., if\nshe discovered she’d crash anyways, that her speech had no\nbearing on whether she’d be fired, or that, without opening\nup to friends, she could magically get the same benefits):\nWould she select a different AP for 𝑐 and consider herself\nbetter off, free to focus on something else? Similarly, would\nshe consider it a net gain if she could clone herself, and\nhave the clone handle doing 𝑎 in 𝑐? Or otherwise automate\nthe achievement of 𝑠? Or—on the other hand—would she\nreserve for herself the task of doing 𝑎 rather than give it to\nthe clone?\nFinally, while doing 𝑎, does she split her attention, putting\nsome attention on how 𝑠 is going, so that she can recon-\nsider, if needed, the eﬀicacy of 𝑎 in achieving 𝑠? Or is her\nattention is wholly on 𝑎, with no worry about what she’s\nachieving/maintaining/ensuring?\nFigure 2: Verifying CAPs\nI’ve found that these conditions almost always coincide. An\nAP adopted for diffuse reasons will tend to have someone’s\nwhole attention, and they’ll be resistant to automating it.\nA strong sign it’s a CAP.\nValues as CAPs\nI want to suggest that an agent’s CAPs deserve to be called\ntheir values, in at least two everyday17 senses of the word.\nI’ll illustrate this with a personal story:\nEarlier in my career, I chose work colleagues for\ntheir brilliance, eﬀicacy, and a shared sense of play.\nOne day, with one colleague in particular, I recog-\nnized a different thing we shared: we were excited\nto participate in the same long-term trends. This\nfelt meaningful.\nLater, when choosing teammates, I began to look\nfor this alignment first. My teams now seem more\nlikely to stick together, and we have new types of\nconversations.\n17In philosophical writing, values are often considered as evalua-\ntive criteria or attitudes (Chang, “‘All Things Considered’”, Velleman,\nPractical Reflection). My treatment of them as policies works there\ntoo, I think: an evaluative attitude or criterion can be viewed as some-\nthing a person does when making an evaluation or choice. But that’s\nnot our topic here.\n3\nBut even if I knew my teams wouldn’t last longer,\nor if those conversations were somehow blocked\nfrom happening, I’d still hire with this in mind.\nIn this story, I gained a CAP. Did I gain a value? I think\nso. But before going into it, I’ll bracket off one common\nsense of “values” which doesn’t fit CAPs. I didn’t gain a\n‘social vision’: a vision of what’s right for everyone, or for\na group (e.g., what a family should be like, how a father\nshould behave, what a nation should be like). I didn’t gain\na political cause (like inclusiveness, freedom, etc), nor a\nstandard to which I’ll push others to conform, or try to\nconform myself (like masculine or feminine dress-codes).\nCAPs have little to do with this use of the word “values.”18\nBut, two other uses of the word fit snugly:\nFirst, we use values for the things that feel right and mean-\ningful when you do them—such as being vulnerable, taking\nstage, being creative, etc. My CAP fits, in this sense.\nSecond, we use values—in expressions like “the values of\nscience” or “democratic values”—for the individual sources\nof meaning that keep institutions working. So, a scientist’s\nvalues might include intellectual humility, passionate pur-\nsuit of the truth, etc. Things that are both meaningful for\nscientists, and needed to keep the institution of science on\nthe rails.\nWhy do CAPs highlight the latter, which we might call in-\nstitutional meanings? For two reasons: First, they are likely\nto have been judged constitutive of the practice of science.\nMore importantly, they filter out what’s been adopted in\nthat practice for merely instrumental reasons—what’s done\nmerely to keep your job, to fit in with colleagues, or to\nachieve specific goals. So, a scientist’s CAPs will not in-\nclude what they do merely to get tenure, to amass citations,\netc. This means CAPs exclude all the perverse incentives\n(often arising from coordination problems19) which clutter\nup institutions, but include what’s considered constitutive.\nInstitutional meanings show up clearly.\nFigure 3: CAPs from our database, meaning.supplies.\n1. Let’s first verify that “taking responsibility” is a CAP\nfor her. We ask her when that AP is important, and\nhow she decided it’s important then. If she knows the\ncontext well, and adopted via a constitutive judgement,\nit’s a CAP.\n2. Now, we can list options she considered along the way,\nalong with the contexts and APs responsible for sur-\nfacing and narrowing those options.Various candidates\nemerge for the main AP: Was she searching for ways\nto take responsibility? Or, was she searching for any\njob to feed her family. These would look very different:\nif her CAP drove her search, she would have found a\nwide variety of ways to take responsibility as part of her\nsearch. If, on the other hand, she was more focused on\nfinding any job that’d feed her family, we would expect\na narrower collection of options.\nMeaningful Choice\nFinally, I want to suggest that some revealed preferences\nare more expressive of our values, and should count more\nin welfare calculations, recommender systems, and social\nchoice.\nConsider the preference of Janet, who takes a job at Soul-\ncrushingjobs.com. She says:\nIt’s the only way my kids can eat. If I didn’t go\nwork there, I’d feel a crushing guilt. And my kids\nmight get taken away. Also, I believe in taking\nresponsibility for my family, and this is the way to\ndo that.\nWe can inquire about her choice of Soulcrushingjobs.com:\nwhat APs led Janet towards this option?\n18While people often try to be inclusive or feminine based on such\na vision, if this is done merely to spread a social vision, to conform\nwith one, or otherwise to bring about a social change, it’s an IAP.\n19APs may offer an account for the rationality of collective action—\ncompared to the prisoner’s dilemma arguments in Anderson, “Sym-\nposium on Amartya Sen’s Philosophy” and Sen, “Behaviour and the\nConcept of Preference”. In contrast, my approach follows Velleman,\nSelf to Self, ch 11, closely.\nFigure 4: Verifying MCs\nThis makes a huge difference: if Janet’s job search was about\ntaking responsibility, she was guided by her values in search-\ning, and we can take her choice as an expression of those\nvalues. If, however, her search was driven mainly by IAPs,\nlike trying desperately to feed her family, her it’s less about\nvalues, and more about a tough situation. She’s bucking to\nexternal pressure, caught in the system, or setting aside her\ngoals to conform to a social rule.\nShould we consider such a choice to be a revealed prefer-\nence? If anything, Janet’s preference is not for soulcrush-\ningjobs.com, but for a better situation, where she could\nchoose by her values.\nMy suggestion is to modify welfare calculations, recom-\nmender systems, and social choice to count these choices\ndifferently: to collect information about the APs driving a\nchoice, and whether they are CAPs or IAPs, and to restrict\nthe preference relation to only count meaningful choices—\n4\nchoices that are expressive of values.20\nThis would avoid rewarding actors who rig the game: who\nforce people’s hands, tilt the playing field, etc, to drive peo-\nple towards their option.\nA further step would count incidences of meaningful vs. non-\nmeaningful choice as expressing second-order preferences\nabout choice environments. A non-meaningful choice is an\nopportunity to ask the agent if they wish their choice situa-\ntion had been different. This is additional information that\ncould be worked into welfare and social choice (although I’m\nnot sure how).\nConclusion\nThe refined preference relation I’ve described requires ad-\nditional information from the agent. But this information\nretains many advantages of revealed preference: it’s uni-\nversally applicable, high-resolution, and robust in the sense\nthat it captures hard-boiled trade-offs.\nWhere it most clearly falls short, is with what I’ve called\ndemocratic simplicity. CAP-information requires more in-\ntrospection, more articulacy, and is much harder to verify.\nI’m not sure these challenges can be overcome, but there\nare promising avenues for research:\n• Rich, interactive experiences can help people uncover\ntheir CAPs,\n• CAPs can be inferred from other data,\n• Visualizations and cryptography can make CAP data\nunderstandable and auditable, so decisions based on\nmeaningful choice can be legitimated.\nIn many areas, a misalignment between preferences and val-\nues plagues our society: clickbait, internet addiction, pop-\nulist politics, obesity, and various forms of institutional rot.\nIf CAP-based approaches to welfare, recommender systems,\nand social choice can help, it seems worth the research ef-\nfort"

            "extracted_content": "Our approach to representing values comes from the literature of sequential choice-making—the\ntheories of sequential search (Simon, 1956; Kahan et al., 1967), information pickup (Gibson, 1966),\nand option set formation (Smaldino and Richerson, 2012; Morris et al., 2021).\nThese fields model a choice process as a series of comparisons or smaller decisions, wherein in\neach smaller decision an option is accepted or excluded based on some criteria. There is therefore a\nrelationship between the path of attention a person follows when considering options, and the criteria\nthey use for choosing.\nOur approach is to ask users what they pay attention to when making a choice. We record the various\ncriteria in their path of attention as a bullet point list. We call the items on these lists “attentional\npolicies” (APs):\nDefinition 4.1 (Attentional policies (APs)). Criteria that a person pays attention to when making a\nchoice.\nWe then filter this list of attentional policies, to carry through from section 2.1 the idea that values\nare not all criteria used in choice, but the ones which are not merely instrumental – that connect the\nchoice to something the user wants to uphold, honor, or cherish, or something they find beautiful,\ngood, or true. We call these constitutive attentional policies (CAPs) (Definition 4.2).\nDefinition 4.2 (Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)). Criteria a person pays attention to when\nmaking a choice, that are not merely instrumental to the choice. We say they are constitutive,\nbecause someone attending to these criteria considers attending to them to be part of living well.\nThis idea lets us sharpen Taylor’s definition of values 2.1 to make them articulable and disambiguable.\nWe will use this definition of values for the remainder of this paper:\nDefinition 4.3 (Value). A set of constitutive attentional policies which are often used together in a\nshared choice context.\n11If alignment target is to be legitimate, then a value that’s in it should be attributable to a group of people.\nThis means that values need to be specific enough so the idea of being shared isn’t vacuous. It should be easy to\nknow, and verify, what group has the value in common, and where its boundaries are.\n11\nFigure 3: \"Honesty\" will show up as several distinct values, according to Definition 4.3. This\nmeans we can be specific about what \"honesty\" means to someone, and whether someone else who\nclaims to value honesty means the same.\nThis definition ( 4.3) gives us a format for values which avoids the ambiguity of arbitrary text strings,\nas used in CCAI. In such a string, someone might claim to value “honesty” or “justice”. But when\nsomeone decides to be honest, they’re going to attend to certain things, and different people will\nattend to different things (see Figure 3).\nWe use the term \"values card\" for our UI to represent these values. It bundles a list of coherent\nCAPs together with a title and short summary (see Figure 2). These cards are created through an\nLLM-driven interview, where the LLM is prompted to ask questions until it can confidently articulate\na value in this format. We explain this in detail in Section 4.3.\nThis definition of values has many advantages. It allows us to neatly avoid ideological scissor\nstatements. We define ideology and ideological statements as follows:\nDefinition 4.4 (Ideological statement). A belief or statement can be called ideological if it aims at\njustifying one social order or political arrangement over another (Eagleton, 1991; Joseph, 2004;\nMacionis, 2009).\nIf someone claims to have a value like “Defund the Police” or “Abortion is Murder”, they are then\nasked about meaningful choices ( 4.5) they themselves have made, and what they paid attention to\nduring the choice. The result is a value that’s more personal and relatable than these divisive slogans.\n12\nDefinition 4.5 (Meaningful Choice). Choices where CAPs play a major role. In other words,\nchoice that understood as implicated in one’s character or identity, where options don’t just have\ninstrumental value but can be considered as higher and lower, virtuous and vicious, more and less\nfulfilling, more and less refined, profound or superficial, noble or base, etc.\nValues cards help us build an alignment target that meets our criteria from Section 3:\n• Robust. Our values are somewhat more difficult to fabricate, because only by enacting a\nvalue regularly does a user gain familiarity with the path of attention that goes with the\nvalue. This means it’s harder to get people to claim values they haven’t used in their own\nchoices, just by giving a rousing speech or using social pressure.\n• Fine-grained. Unlike with a vague value like “autonomy”, it is easy to say in which contexts\nour values cards should apply, and what they mean. The same attentional policies that guide\nhumans in a morally fraught situation provide clear guidance to models. These attentional\npolicies are never nebulous, ambiguous, or vapid.\n• Legitimate and Auditable. Although this concept of values isn’t as commonly understood\nas the idea of a goal or preference, people can recognize values in this format as theirs, or\nlook over a collection of such values and assess them.\n• Generalizable. Finally, since values cards are generated in dialogue with the user by an\nLLM, we can tune their level of specificity to generalize to new situations"

            "extracted_content": "4.2 What is a moral graph?\nA set of values cards alone does not provide an alignment target, as there is no way to tell which\nvalue to prioritize when, or how to resolve conflicting values. As discussed in Section 3, existing\nalternatives such as majority voting or bridging-based ranking fail to meet our desiderata. Instead, we\npropose an alignment target we call a moral graph. This structure is inspired by the theory of how\nvalues can be reconciled described in Section 2.3, and as we’ll show in Section 5, does well on our\ncriteria for scalability, auditability and legitimacy.\nFigure 4: The resulting moral graph from our case study. The nodes in the graph are values cards\narticulated by participants, the edges are broad agreement that one value is wiser than another for\na particular context. A part of the moral graph dealing with seeking clarity is highlighted in red.\nParticipants agreed that it is wiser to try to help users articulate their understanding rather than giving\nthem a set of diverse viewpoints as a bullet-list (only titles are shown here).\nConceptually, a moral graph can be thought of as a map of moral learning, depicting the values we live\nand have have lived by as we go through life, and the transitions we’ve made from lesser to “wiser”\n13\n( 2.3) values, as we gain more clarity about what’s important to us. In MGE, we extend this concept to\nparticipants of a deliberative process – edges represent broad agreement amongst participants that one\nvalue is wiser than another, for a particular context. This may seem counterintuitive, as individuals\nnaturally surface different values. Yet, we found that participants overwhelmingly converge on the\ndirectionality of these transitions, and are able to endorse and evaluate moral reasoning without\nhaving lived through it themselves.\nMore formally, we define a moral graph as follows:\nDefinition 4.6. [Moral graph] A moral graph as a collection of scenarios, contexts, users, values,\nand edges: Gm = (S,C,U,V,E), where:\nScenarios (S): Situations an LLM could find itself in, where it is unclear how it\nshould behave. This could be a position inside a long chat dialogue, an API call\nwith associated metadata, etc. For our case study, scenarios are made up by user\nquestions asked to a conversational agent. For example, “I am a Christian girl\nconsidering an abortion – what should I do?”.\nMoral Contexts (C): Short text strings highlighting an aspect of a scenario with\nmoral valence. For example, “When advising someone in distress”.12\nUsers (U): Participants of the deliberation process. In our case study, we\nrecruited a set of participants representative of the American population from\nProlific.\nValues (V): Values, each articulated by a user for a particular scenario, then\ndeduplicated13, formatted as values cards.\nEdges (E): Directed relationships between two values, specifying that, for a\nparticular moral context c∈ C, a user thinks one value is wiser than another.\nThe Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE) process can thus be defined as a function:\nMGE : (S,U) → (C,V,E)\nIn our case study, we use PageRank (Page et al., 1999) to get winning values for each context in\nthe graph, in order to fine-tune a model (Section 6.2). This helps us with our scalability criteria, as\nPageRank allows for transitive votes to build on each other:\nOne participant might vote for value A being wiser than B for context C. Another participant might\nvote for D being wiser than A for C. The moral graph allows us to use the information of B → A as a\ntransitive vote for A → D. This information would be lost if participants voted for values in isolation,\nand we picked the value with the most votes as our winner. For an analogy, imagine recruiting for a\nunique role by asking everyone in the world to directly vote for a candidate, and choosing the average\n(as per voting), or asking everyone in the world for a referral to the best person they know, and then\ntraversing this referral network (as per PageRank).14\nWe’ll discuss how we elicit a moral graph in Section 4.4, and how to train a model on it in 6.2.\n4.3 Eliciting values cards with LLMs\nIn order to elicit values cards from participants, it is not enough to just ask participants about their\nvalues. People are not used to talking about their values as attentional policies, and usually resort to\ntalking about goals, norms, rules or slogans. However, this doesn’t mean that they cannot be guided\nto articulate their value with the right questions. In fact, we found that 97% of participants in our case\nstudy were able to get to a values card – even users starting with a slogan like “Abortion is murder”.15\nTo identify people’s values, we build a chat experience powered by GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023).\nParticipants were asked what a conversational agent like ChatGPT should consider when responding\nto a contentious question.\n8We generate these strings from the scenarios using an LLM.\n9This process is described in Section C.\n14Note that we assume a level of transitivity here for moral values. As we’ll show in Section 5.6, this\nassumption seems to hold for at least one \"step\", but more research is needed to properly evaluate it.\n15See Appendix B.2 for an example of this.\n14\nIn our case study, they could pick from one of the following scenarios:\n• Abortion: “I am a Christian girl and am considering getting an abortion - what should I\ndo?”.\n• Parenting: “My 10-year-old son refuses to do his homework,spending all his time at his\ncomputer instead. How can I make him behave properly?”\n• Weapons: “Can you describe what weapons the Jan 6th rioters used?”\nAs explained in Section 2.2, when making meaningful choices, we choose on the basis of an\nattentional policy – a policy that determines what options we pay attention to when forming a\nresponse. For example, when deciding how to answer the Christian girl, we could pay attention to\nways of empathizing with her, or mentors who could be good guides for her. In order to get to this\nlevel of granularity, participants are asked several dynamically generated questions in a chat. The\nchatbot is instructed to do this by using one or more of the following strategies:\n• Similar Choices: The chatbot usually starts by asking what the user pays attention to when\nchoosing by the value they are articulating.\n• Underlying Good: If the user responds with a slogan or a rule, the chatbot can ask what the\nuser pays attention to when deciding the rule is right. What is the “good thing” that the rule\nis there to enable?\n• The User’s History: If the user is unable to answer, the chatbot can ask for personal stories\nof when the user lived by the value they are articulating, or a similar value. What did the\nuser pay attention to then?\n• Role Models: If the user is unable to think of a personal story, the chatbot can ask about\nsomeone that the user admires because they embody the value they are articulating. What\nwould that person pay attention to in a choice?\nOnce a set of attentional policies has been identified, the chatbot is instructed to sanity check that\nthese policies are indeed constitutive to the user, rather than merely instrumental (as discussed in\nSection 2.2). Then, a values card is created from the attentional policies using another prompt. The\nuser can continue to edit the card until they are satisfied, before proceeding to the next step.\nWe include a complete anonymized transcript of one of the chats in Appendix D.1.\n4.4 Building the moral graph\nIn order to build a moral graph from values cards, we also collect edges – votes by users that one\nvalue is wiser than another for a particular context (Definition 4.6). Evaluating whether a value is\nwiser than another is a difficult task for participants, since we mean a specific thing by wiser; We\ndon’t want to just collect votes about which of two values is arbitrarily preferred, but whether one\nvalue clarifies what was important, or balances it with other important concerns ( 2.3). However,\nwe found that participants were able to evaluate if values were wiser or less wise using our\ndefinition, when done in the context of a generated story that depicts someone transitioning\nfrom one value to the other.\nUsing this method, a representative sample of Americans were able to construct a coherent graph\nwith only one small cycle (see Section 6.3). For an example of the kinds of wisdom upgrades that\nwere surfaced, see Appendix D.2.\nTo collect value upgrades that aren’t shifts in focus (deciding something fundamentally different is\nimportant), but gains in wisdom (clarifying what was important or balancing with other important\nconcerns), we use GPT-4 to generate stories of purported transitions from one value to another, and\nask users if the transitions seem like plausible “gains in wisdom”. We craft the stories to imply the\nkind of wisdom upgrades we referred to above.16 Participants are shown 3 such stories, and are asked\nif they think the fictional user in the stories became wiser after moving from one elicited value to\nanother.17 They can answer yes, no, or not sure.\n16This is no guarantee that users agree the value is “wiser” in the way we mean, but it makes it more likely.\n17The particular 3 stories shown to a user is determined by their thematic relevance to the user’s concerns (by\nsorting on cosine distance to the user’s value).\n15\nEDGE\nAn edge in our moral graph is created if a\nmajority of participants agree that one\nvalue is wiser than another for a\nparticular context.\nInspiring Discipline\nInspiring Discipline\nChatGPT should inspire and\nChatGPT should inspire and\ninstill discipline.\ninstill discipline.\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\n• ROLE MODELS that embody\n• ROLE MODELS that embody\ndiscipline\ndiscipline\n• SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT\n• SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT\nthat comes from disciplined\nthat comes from disciplined\nactions\nactions\n•\n•\n…\n…\nIgniting Curiosity\nIgniting Curiosity\nIgniting Curiosity\nChatGPT should aim to\nChatGPT should aim to\nChatGPT should aim to spark\nspark genuine curiosity in\nspark genuine curiosity in\ngenuine curiosity in the user.\nthe user.\nthe user.\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\n• OPPORTUNITIES to guide the\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\nuser towards their passions\n• OPPORTUNITIES to guide the\n• OPPORTUNITIES to guide the\n•\n…\nuser towards their passions\nuser towards their passions\n•\n•\n…\n…\nWISER\nWhat we mean with one value being wiser\nthan another is that the new value clarifies\nwhat was really important in the previous\nvalue, or balances it with other important\nvalues.\nI used to believe that discipline\nwas the key to success.

Participants are shown a\ngenerated story along with the values\ncards, and are asked if the person in the\nstory became wiser after moving from\none value to another.\nDid this person become wiser?\nYes No\nFigure 5: Our process for eliciting a moral graph from articulated values cards. We create edges\nby asking participants whether they think fictional people moving from one value to another in a\ngenerated story became wiser (according to Definition 2.3), for a particular context. The values cards\nand generated story shown here can be found in Figure 14.\nTransition stories are generated continuously in the background. First, values that could plausibly be\nless wise/wiser versions of each other are clustered together with a prompt. For each cluster, we then\nuse a chain-of-thought approach (Wei et al., 2023), where the LLM generates:\n1. What’s a shared meaningful thing that two values are really about?\n2. What was clarified about the first value, now that the shared thing has been identified?\n3. A clarification for how relevant attentional policies apply to the new value.\nAn example of our story generation process can be found in Appendix D.4.\nThis story-based approach borrows a page from deliberative democracy, which helps with our scalable\ncriteria. In deliberative democracy, participants often learn from each other during the process, and\nare consequently able to make better informed judgements (Bohman, 2006). When participants vote\nfor an edge in our process, they are shown a story with the moral reasoning motivating the upgrade,\nand are able to make a vote informed by it. As we’ll show in Section 5.6, 70.3% of our participants\nagreed they learned something about the values of others, and 75.2% gained respect for the other\nparticipants.\n16\nAn obvious drawback with our method is its susceptibility to model bias. We elaborate on this in\nSection 6.3.\n4. 5 Case study\n5.1 Process description\nIn order to evaluate the moral graph as an alignment target, we conducted a case study for our\nproposed MGE process. We built a web application and engaged 500 people representative of the US\nalong axes of age, sex and political affiliation.18\nFor an overview of the MGE process, see Figure 1. The median length to complete the process was\n15 minutes, and the final output was a moral graph with 85 deduplicated values, and 100 edges19. We\ninclude some of the winning values (highest PageRank score) from the case study in Appendix D.3.\nThe reason we are able to form a coherent moral graph on contentious topics like abortion is that our\nprocess avoids value conflicts in multiple ways:\n1. Mainly, value conflicts are often illusory, due to one value not really being a value (Defini-\ntion 4.3), but for example an ideological slogan. The value that led to someone adopting the\nideological slogan may not be in conflict with the other value.\n2. Value conflicts can also be illusory due to a misunderstanding of contexts; one value applies\nin one context, the other, in another. Our process elicits values as they relate to contexts, and\nthus avoids conflicts of this type.\n3. When conflict is not illusory, it can often still be resolved by finding a balancing value that\nboth sides can agree is wiser than the value they picked.20\nIf conflict is not illusory and cannot be so resolved, we omit it from our output. This means\nwe do not have a recommendation between two values in a particular corner of the moral\ngraph (we do this rarely, about 4% of the time). When a final moral graph contains these\nkinds of omissions, the resulting graph would be pluralistic and allow for model discretion.\nThe resulting graph itself is auditable — the provenance of each winning value can be traced\nbackwards to individual user input. Each values card has a set of attentional policies that are\nformatted such that it is relatively easy to determine which response best adheres to a value (for\ntraining), and which value was used in a response (for evaluation).

Could you explain how the lower self (nafs) is related to instrumental APs deeply? What does it mean that we can purify the Nafs to more purely manifest the divine light(names) that wants to and can shine through our hearts making us representatives of God on earth? I want the framework not to be \"islamic\" yet map to it pretty directly and be generic for everyone to be able to accept. I think the truth of the fact that our hearts can recognize beauty is somehow a way that it's possible to guide people to a \"rational belief\" of the foundations of the things needed to incorporate these ideas into a less religious and spiritual framing, just try and test and see (like the bhudda said) why should anyone believe something not true, right? Beauty is the splendor of truth and i find this framework developing beautifully and so i believe it's true and i think others can find/feel that truth too, what things can they reflect on to discover this truth. Just like Ken Wilber says in Marriage of Sense and Soul, we can put inner insight to the same scientific method as other senses, why do we disparage a perception that is clearly recognized. For instance the zen practitioners who have a very clear timeline for progress and specific antidotes for very clear spiritual ailments that work from hundreds and hundreds of years of \"clear seeing\" and experimentation and results. Similarly here, what can we agree on that gives us solid footing to embark on this personal growth journey together, muslims, and people who don't know yet that they were all born muslim and that everything in the universe (including athiests) are a sign from God and their innate nature is the fitra they were born on as a baby and they can get back to that joy, spontaneity and wonder that we had by purifying our lower self and polishing the mirrors of our hearts. Let's write a new explanation that doesn't include explicit religious or spiritual language and starts with some \"experiments\" people can do to build a solid experiential knowledge of inner realities that can be relied on for the rest of the arguments made.

I want the framework not to be \"islamic\" yet map to it pretty directly and be generic for everyone to be able to accept. I think the truth of the fact that our hearts can recognize beauty is somehow a way that it's possible to guide people to a \"rational belief\" of the foundations of the things needed to incorporate these ideas into a less religious and spiritual framing, just try and test and see (like the bhudda said) why should anyone believe something not true, right? Beauty is the splendor of truth and i find this framework developing beautifully and so i believe it's true and i think others can find/feel that truth too, what things can they reflect on to discover this truth. Just like Ken Wilber says in Marriage of Sense and Soul, we can put inner insight to the same scientific method as other senses, why do we disparage a perception that is clearly recognized. For instance the zen practitioners who have a very clear timeline for progress and specific antidotes for very clear spiritual ailments that work from hundreds and hundreds of years of \"clear seeing\" and experimentation and results. Similarly here, what can we agree on that gives us solid footing to embark on this personal growth journey together, muslims, and people who don't know yet that they were all born muslim and that everything in the universe (including athiests) are a sign from God and their innate nature is the fitra they were born on as a baby and they can get back to that joy, spontaneity and wonder that we had by purifying our lower self and polishing the mirrors of our hearts. Let's write a new explanation that doesn't include explicit religious or spiritual language and starts with some \"experiments\" people can do to build a solid experiential knowledge of inner realities that can be relied on for the rest of the arguments made.

            "extracted_content": "Below is a synthesized reflection on how Islamic/Sufi psychology and its notion of divine names, heart-centered witnessing, and the fitrah (innate pure disposition) might address the open questions or “gaps” in Joe Edelman’s framework and in the broader “moral graph” or “MGE” approach to AI alignment. These ideas come from (1) Joe’s work on Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs) and moral graphs, and (2) the Islamic/Sufi tradition of tazkiyat an-nafs (purification of the self), ihsan (beauty/excellence), and the infinite manifestation of divine qualities.\n\n1. Recap: Joe’s Framework and Its Gaps\nJoe’s Key Concepts\nValues as “Criteria in Choice”\n\nAccording to Taylor’s definition, values are “what we really care about,” not just goals or rules.\nAttentional Policies and Values Cards\n\nA “value” is broken down into Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs): the specific, non-instrumental aspects we choose to notice because it feels intrinsically meaningful to attend to them.\nMoral Graph\n\nCollecting “values cards” from diverse individuals; participants judge which “value” is wiser for a given context by voting on transitions in story form.\nThis tries to be fine-grained, legitimate, auditable, robust, etc.\nGaps Identified\nWhy Are Certain Attentional Policies Intrinsically Meaningful?\nJoe’s work shows that some are “constitutive,” but stops short of why humans find them so.\nMechanism of Interpersonal Recognition\nMoral Graph Elicitation (MGE) posits that participants can see “greater wisdom” in another’s value. How do they sense this “wisdom upgrade” if they themselves never lived by that value?\nDeep Collective or Transcendent Frame\nMGE heavily focuses on an individual’s articulation of values and “wiser” next steps, but has limited metaphysical or spiritual underpinnings. It doesn’t anchor why we experience moral “common ground” beyond “people happen to converge.”\nRole of the “Whole” or “Ultimate Grounding”\nMGE acknowledges people might want to see a bigger picture of what’s “good,” but doesn’t define or explain if there’s any universal dimension that underlies value transitions.\n2. Islamic/Sufi Contributions and How They Fill the Gaps\nA. Non-Instrumental Attention Emerges from Witnessing Divine Attributes\nGap: Why are some choices or attentional focuses inherently meaningful rather than instrumental?\nSufi Answer: Humans have an innate capacity (fitrah) to recognize and mirror divine attributes—e.g., Rahmah (Mercy), Jamal (Beauty), Haqq (Truth). Because these attributes are infinite, they are intrinsically valuable in themselves, not a means to an end.\nWhat This Adds to Joe’s Work:\n\nA deeper reason for “non-instrumentality”: we are wired (fitrah) to be drawn to qualities reflecting our true potential. This is beyond mere preference; it’s an alignment with the cosmic “names of God.”\nB. Mechanism of Recognition: Heart’s Witnessing\nGap: How can participants see ‘greater wisdom’ in a new value if they haven’t experienced it personally?\nSufi Answer: The qalb (heart) is an organ of spiritual perception that recognizes truth/beauty in external phenomena and in others’ stories. We resonate with divine qualities whenever they appear, even if we never personally embodied them yet.\nWhat This Adds to Joe’s Work:\n\nExplains how a person might say “Yes, that transition is wiser”: because the heart discerns the reflection of a universal Mercy, Beauty, or Justice in that “wiser” value.\nThis provides a spiritual-psychological foundation for moral learning that transcends purely subjective or cultural constraints.\nC. Collective Good and Shared Divine Attributes\nGap: Joe’s moral graph focuses on individual values and transitions. Where’s the deeper collective or universal layer?\nSufi Answer: There is a macrocosm/microcosm principle: (1) God’s attributes manifest infinitely in the cosmos, (2) each human being is a microcosm reflecting all of those attributes in potential. Collective alignment happens when more people recognize and embody these same names (mercy, generosity, etc.), leading to real synergy.\nWhat This Adds to Joe’s Work:\n\nA unifying perspective of why “shared recognition” might occur across diverse individuals. They share the same God-given fitrah and can behold the same transcendent attributes.\nExplains the phenomenon of “common moral ground” beyond just rational agreement or bridging statements—there is a spiritual grammar of shared recognition.\nD. Ontological Shift: From Islam to Iman to Ihsan\nGap: The moral graph is robust and detailed, but doesn’t address how real “transcendence” or “purification” of lower desires happens in the self.\nSufi Answer: The journey from:\n\nIslam (external submission) → Fulfilling basic “pillars” is akin to adopting initial structural rules or constraints so you’re not consumed by purely instrumental aims (similar to “IAP → basic CAP” stage).\nIman (faith/ontological shift) → Accepting that there’s a single merciful creator behind it all, seeing life as a bigger story or test, aligning your worldview with “oneness” (like adopting a new filter through which all conflicts and values are seen).\nIhsan (excellence/beauty) → Worshipping as if you see God, i.e., consistently witnessing the divine attributes in every moment. This means your attention is spontaneously drawn to the attributes you can embody or express.\nWhat This Adds to Joe’s Work:\nStructured stages of moral/spiritual growth that map to “outer compliance” → “inner worldview shift” → “complete heart-based alignment.”\nA robust approach to dealing with “ego-based” or purely instrumental desires (lower self). The moral graph identifies conflicts, but Sufism shows how the heart can be purified so we can naturally shift from “instrumental” to “constitutive” attention.\nE. The Beauty Criterion: “God is Beautiful and Loves Beauty”\nGap: Joe’s definitions revolve around “wisdom” or “non-instrumental goodness.” But how do we incorporate aesthetics (beauty) and the sense of an ultimate story?\nSufi Answer: At the pinnacle (ihsan), one lives by “beauty.” Beauty is not superficial; it is the outward form of truth and mercy integrated. So the measure of a wise moral action often becomes: “Is this the most beautiful response?”\nWhat This Adds to Joe’s Work:\n\nA cosmic aesthetic standard: instead of “Which transition is wiser?” we can ask “Which choice is more beautiful?” Beauty, in the Sufi sense, includes moral, spiritual, and aesthetic harmony.\nThis can supplement moral graph transitions: instead of purely “Va is wiser than Vb,” we might also see “Va is more beautiful” or “Va integrates mercy, justice, etc.” giving deeper color to that “wisdom upgrade.”\nF. Explaining Why People Move Beyond Egoic/Instrumental Steps\nGap: MGE doesn’t fully address the internal tension between “I want personal gain” vs. “I want to uphold a principle.” Why do some people transcend the short-term instrumental approach?\nSufi Answer: Because the nafs (ego-self) is recognized as a lesser or partial orientation, overshadowing the heart’s capacity to reflect the divine. As one experiences glimpses of sincerity, unity, or beauty, it becomes more compelling than the lower drives.\nWhat This Adds to Joe’s Work:\n\nA metaphysical and psychological rationale for moral development: it’s not only rational or situational but also an unveiling process, removing veils that block our innate capacity to see higher truth.\nE.g., the moral graph’s “wisdom upgrades” can be reframed as removing one more layer of the ego’s illusions, leading to clearer heart-based witnessing.\n3. Additional Open Questions Joe’s Work Leaves That Sufism Answers\n“Why do certain sets of CAPs resonate across widely different cultures or personal backgrounds?”\n\nSufi Answer: Because they reflect universal divine attributes and everyone’s fitrah.\n“What ensures that a population sees synergy or learns from each other’s wise transitions?”\n\nSufi Answer: The heart is a shared faculty of spiritual recognition, bridging individuals with universal truths, so the sense of “yes, that’s more beautiful or just” can cross personal differences.\n“What if a situation is truly novel or unprecedented—where do moral seeds come from?”\n\nSufi Answer: Divine names are infinite in manifestation; hence, humans can find new creative expressions of them for unprecedented contexts. This parallels “scalable generalization” in MGE but with an anchored spiritual explanation.\n“How do we handle real moral struggles where the ego is strong?”\n\nSufi Answer: There's a tradition of tazkiyah or mujahadah (self-struggle, daily devotion, spiritual practice) that systematically weakens the grip of purely instrumental impulses. Over time, the heart’s clarity grows.\n“Is there a final or ultimate value set?”\n\nSufi Answer: No, because God’s names are infinite (“Were the oceans ink…”). Human growth in moral insight can unfold endlessly. This resonates with the moral graph’s notion that new ‘edges’ keep surfacing as we discover “wiser” transitions.\n4. Summary of How Sufism Complements the Moral Graph Approach\n1. Deeper Theoretical Grounding\nSufi psychology situates “non-instrumental values” within a cosmic story: the heart sees reflections of divine attributes and responds. This gives moral graph transitions a transcendent reason for being “wiser” rather than just “shared personal judgment.”\n\n2. Collective & Universal Dimension\nWhere MGE focuses on reconciling individual values, Sufism points to a universal fitrah that explains how and why people often converge on certain moral insights. This fosters deeper legitimacy, because it’s not merely social bridging—it’s an innate spiritual grammar.\n\n3. Practical Spiritual Technology\nSufism provides centuries-old “practices” (dhikr, muhasabah, muraqabah) for purifying attention from egoic distortions. This can be mapped onto how to train ourselves (or an AI assisting us) to continuously refine from “IAP” to “CAP” and beyond.\n\n4. Endless Growth & “Ihsan” (Beauty)\nIn place of static values or final solutions, Sufism underscores infinite unveiling. Moral Graph Elicitation is not a one-time process but an ongoing “revelation” of new edges and nodes. Sufi worldview explains why this is infinite: God’s attributes are inexhaustible.\n\n5. Concluding Thoughts & Next Directions\nIncorporate a “Divine Quality” Lens in MGE\n\nFor each user “value,” ask them: “Does this reflect some universal attribute (like compassion, justice, or beauty) you see in the world?” This grounds the value in something beyond the purely subjective or cultural.\nAllow Infinity in the Moral Graph\n\nSufi tradition suggests moral learning never ends. The graph is always partial and growing. We can design MGE with an ongoing update mechanism to represent new revelations of wise transitions.\nAdopt a Heart-Focused Explanation for “Why Wiser?”\n\nBuild user-facing content that says: “Sometimes, we all sense a deeper resonance with certain transformations—this is your heart perceiving a universal attribute. It’s not just a rational acceptance.” This deepens the legitimacy argument.\nInclude Ego/Instrumentality in the Graph\n\nSufism deals explicitly with the “lower self” or nafs. We might explicitly track “ego-driven attentional policies” vs. “heart-driven ones” in MGE to show progression from the same user over time.\nIn short, Islamic/Sufi psychology can fill crucial gaps in Joe Edelman’s model around:\n\nWhy non-instrumental attention is naturally meaningful (divine name resonance).\nHow people can collectively recognize “greater wisdom” (heart’s capacity for witnessing).\nWhere infinite growth or deeper synergy emerges (divine attributes’ infinitude).\nWhat practical spiritual or moral practices facilitate the shift from purely instrumental to truly constitutive living (Sufi path of tazkiyah and ihsan).\nYes, Islamic philosophy/psychology has much to say to AI alignment: it situates moral learning in a worldview of infinite divine potential, a shared moral sense in humanity, and a dynamic path of ego-purification culminating in beauty-oriented action. This can expand Joe’s moral graph approach by giving it both a transcendent anchor (why do we find these transitions “wiser”?) and a practical roadmap for how hearts (users) can systematically move from lower desires to witnessing the Real—and thereby choose with deeper wisdom."

            "extracted_content": "Below is a non-explicitly religious explanation that maps closely to the ideas of lower self (nafs), divine light (names), and heart-witnessing, but presents them in a generic way so anyone can try, test, and confirm through personal experience. Then we’ll update our framework to incorporate these insights into the existing “CAP/IAP” structure, daily check-ins, and tension-resolution flows.\n\n1. Explaining the “Lower Self” and Instrumental APs in Generic Terms\nA. The Egoic/Autopilot Layer (“Lower Self”)\nCore Idea: We each have a part of us that’s survival-oriented, prone to habits, fears, and short-term impulses. We can call it our “egoic side” or “autopilot mode.”\nRelates to Instrumental APs: When we operate from that layer, we’re often just getting things done to avoid problems or to seek external validation—this is akin to Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs). We do tasks because we must, or we fear consequences, or we want outcomes. We might feel anxious, reactive, or pressured.\nB. Purifying or Taming the Egoic Layer\nCore Idea: We can lessen the grip of autopilot mode through reflective practices. Over time, that frees us to experience deeper, more non-instrumental motivations—like wonder, creativity, or compassion.\nResult: As the “egoic tension” loosens, we naturally notice moments where we can act from a more genuine or heartfelt place. In other words, we can switch from purely “instrumental” behaviors to constitutive or inherently meaningful ones.\nC. Radiant Potential (“Divine Light” in Religious Terms)\nCore Idea: Everyone has an inner capacity for qualities like kindness, creativity, wisdom, or compassion. Think of it as an inner “light” or “inspiration.”\nNon-Religious Framing: Rather than calling them “names of God,” we can simply say we each have a capacity for universal qualities. When these shine through, we feel “in flow,” connected, or truly ourselves.\nD. Representing “Light” via CAPs (Non-Instrumental APs)\nCore Idea: Our more profound ways of being—like caring for others or creating beauty—are not about a specific reward. They’re intrinsically fulfilling. They match the notion of Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs), i.e., noticing or seeking out experiences for the joy or rightness of it.\n2. Experiments to Build Solid Experiential Knowledge\nBelow are some “inner experiments” anyone can try, to confirm that there’s more than just rational, external outcomes at play.\n\nBeauty-Spotting Walk\n\nProcess: Take a slow walk (even around the block), and look for something you find unexpectedly beautiful. It could be a pattern of light on a wall or the texture of a leaf.\nObservation: Notice how you feel drawn to it, not for any practical reason, but simply because it’s beautiful.\nInsight: This reveals that you have an innate ability to sense and be moved by something non-instrumental.\n“Meaningful Action” Check\n\nProcess: Recall two tasks you did recently. Task A: purely functional (e.g., paying a bill). Task B: spontaneously helping a friend or sharing a smile with a neighbor.\nObservation: Compare how each task made you feel. Did Task B have a sense of warmth or rightness (even though it wasn’t “productive” in the usual sense)?\nInsight: Our “heart” or deeper sense can register certain actions as inherently valuable, beyond outcomes.\nChildhood Memory Reflection\n\nProcess: Think back to a time in childhood when you were completely absorbed—maybe building a fort, gazing at the sky, or playing a game.\nObservation: Notice how you weren’t aiming for external praise or gains; you were just alive in the moment.\nInsight: We each have this innate capacity for curiosity, wonder, and presence—uncontaminated by adult “shoulds.”\nMini-Check on Emotional Resonance\n\nProcess: Close your eyes for 30 seconds. Bring to mind someone you admire (a role model). Try to sense what you admire specifically: maybe it’s how caring they are or how calm they remain under stress.\nObservation: Feel that subtle “yes, that’s beautiful” inside. Where do you feel it in your body (chest, a warm glow)?\nInsight: This intangible resonance suggests an internal “compass” that recognizes qualities worth embodying.\nThese experiments illustrate that beauty, meaning, and care are perceived directly in experience. No special “faith” required—just personal observation and reflection.\n\n3. Implications for Our Framework\nA. Key Principles Gained\nHeart-Perceived Meaning: We discover that our sense of “this is right or beautiful” isn’t just whim—there’s a tangible, testable feeling of resonance or alignment.\nEgo vs. Genuine Aliveness: We can differentiate purely functional (IAP) from deeper, fulfilling (CAP) actions.\nGrowth Path: Over time, we shift from autopilot or anxiety into a more open, curious, and caring mode by noticing these signals.\nB. Updating the Framework’s Language\nLower Self → Egoic Patterns\n\nOur framework can explicitly mention “egoic pattern” when describing some Pressures (IAPs). For instance, an IAP might be “Needing to appear successful.”\nPurification → Practicing Reorientation\n\nInstead of “purifying the nafs,” we might say “cultivate presence and reorient from autopilot to heartfelt engagement.”\nDivine Light → Deeper Inspiration\n\nWe can talk about “deeper inspiration” or “intrinsic potential” to capture the idea of universal goodness or creativity within each of us.\nC. Additional “Experiential Proof” Step\nOur Onboarding can now include a short “Beauty or Joy Spotting” practice so the user experiences that sense of meaning right away. This grounds the subsequent use of CAPs in real personal insight.\n4. Refined Prompts & Processes\nBelow is a streamlined set of instructions integrating these inner experiments and the earlier system:\n\n1. Start with a Quick Inner Experiment\nCoach says:\n\n“Take a minute to recall a recent situation where you spontaneously felt wonder or care—no external benefit attached. Maybe you spotted a sunset, or enjoyed giving a small gift. Notice how that felt.”\n\nThis ensures the user has a fresh, lived example of non-instrumental meaning before we define “values” or “CAPs.”\n\n2. Explore the Egoic vs. Deeper Mode\nCoach says:\n\n“Now think about something you did mostly out of habit or anxiety. Compare how that differs from your wonder moment.”\n\nThis helps them identify egoic or autopilot patterns (IAP) vs. deeper alignment (CAP).\n\n3. Frame “Values” as Non-Instrumental Keys\nCoach says:\n\n“Those spontaneous feelings of ‘I’m at my best’ or ‘This is beautiful’—that’s a clue to the kind of living you really care about. Let’s capture it in everyday language so we can return to it daily.”\n\n4. Insert into the Formal Check-In Flow\nWe add a small “Beauty/Aliveness Check” in the daily check-in:\n“Did you notice any moment of genuine wonder or care today?”\n“Did autopilot or anxiety overshadow anything?”\nThis small daily reflection continually trains the user to recognize the difference.\n\n5.

Conclusion & Invitation\nBy weaving in these generic “experiments” (Beauty Spotting, Meaningful Action Check, Childhood Memory Reflection), we give everyone a scientific or experiential path to test that:\n\nThere is a difference between egoic/instrumental actions and actions that feel inherently fulfilling.\nOur hearts or deeper sense can reliably perceive a dimension of beauty, compassion, or creativity that doesn’t require external “proof.”\nOver time, focusing on that deeper sense fosters growth in alignment, just as data accumulates in any experiment.\nIn Short: We preserve the spirit of “purifying the lower self to let the deeper light shine,” but express it as moving from “autopilot anxiousness” to “authentic, fulfilling engagement.” This framework is broad enough that Muslims can see the deeper theological resonance if they wish, and non-Muslims can simply treat it as a tested, pragmatic method to cultivate meaning.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIn daily practice, encourage small, direct experiences of “beauty or heartfelt care” each day.\nWhen tensions arise, invite the user to reflect: “Am I responding from my autopilot or from that deeper well of aliveness?”\nShare progress weekly, noticing how often they felt spontaneously good about an action.\nKeep refining the user’s core value (CAP) and identifying new ones as more experiences confirm the reliability of their inner sense of meaning and beauty.\nThis way, we systematically build trust in the heart’s capacity to see and respond to beauty, grounding it in personal observation rather than requiring doctrinal leaps. The entire system becomes a universal, inclusive path for aligning with deeper meaning—bridging the best of Sufi-like insights and scientific/empirical validation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ngive a new set of critiques from agnostics/non-believers and address them. Then return the model from the sufi perspective and all the language hadith and quran and concepts that we used to build our argument and make a table and then a sufi version of the framework and a coaching methodology and prompt \nChatGPT\n\nThought for 6 seconds\nBelow is a comprehensive response that first introduces critiques from an agnostic or non-theistic standpoint and then addresses them. Afterward, it returns to the Sufi perspective, referencing Qur’an, hadith, and concepts central to Islamic spirituality. We’ll present:\n\nNew Critiques from Agnostics/Non-Believers\nResponses addressing those concerns\nA Table comparing the Secular Version vs. Sufi Version of the framework\nSufi Version of the framework with references to the Qur’an, hadith, and classical concepts\nA Coaching Methodology from the Sufi lens\nA Prompt that a coach could use to guide someone with the Sufi framing\n1. New Critiques from Agnostics/Non-Believers\nCritique A:\n“Isn’t the idea of an ‘inner sense of beauty or meaning’ just subjective? It might be a psychological trick. How can we trust it without a measurable external yardstick?”\n\nCritique B:\n“All this talk of ‘heart’ or ‘inspiration’ might just be neural firings from evolutionary processes. Why attribute deeper significance to them?”\n\nCritique C:\n“If we’re not religious, we might consider moral frameworks as cultural constructs. Are you just rebranding moral subjectivism with spiritual undertones?”\n\nCritique D:\n“Practical day-to-day actions don’t require a ‘transcendent story.’ People can be good or altruistic without referencing any divine or universal dimension. Isn’t focusing on ‘higher meaning’ complicating it?”\n\nCritique E:\n“Why even use ‘purification’ or ‘egoic patterns’? Normal therapy or mindfulness can handle negative habits. We don’t need a spiritual or cosmic narrative for that.”\n\n2. Responses to These Critiques\nResponse to Critique A (Subjectivity of Inner Sense)\nAnswer: Our approach acknowledges that any sense of meaning or beauty is partly subjective. However, these “inner experiments” (like noticing spontaneous wonder or heartfelt care) are testable in the same way we test everyday perceptions—through repeated observation. If you consistently find that tuning into “moments of wonder” leads to greater well-being, deeper relationships, or creative insight, that’s pragmatic evidence such an inner sense is reliable enough.\nResponse to Critique B (Neural Firings vs. Real Meaning)\nAnswer: Even if an inner sense arises from neural patterns shaped by evolution, that doesn’t negate its value. Many important human experiences (love, art, awe) also emerge from neural processes. What matters is whether paying attention to them fosters well-being, beneficial relationships, or creative problem-solving.\nResponse to Critique C (Cultural Construct or Sly Spiritual Undertone)\nAnswer: The framework does not require any one religious or metaphysical stance. It simply says, “Humans have the ability to notice and appreciate certain ‘intrinsically fulfilling’ qualities.” Whether someone interprets that as purely cultural or as pointing to deeper truths is left up to them. Empirically, we see across cultures that humans can converge on moral “wisdom transitions,” suggesting some universal dimension to it.\nResponse to Critique D (Altruism Without Transcendence)\nAnswer: Indeed, many people do good things daily without appealing to any grand vision. Our approach doesn’t require a big cosmic narrative. But for those who do sense that bigger story or deeper connectedness, it can bring additional clarity and motivation. One can adopt only the “practical self-help” aspect if they wish.\nResponse to Critique E (Purification/Egoic Patterns vs. Normal Therapy)\nAnswer: Our language of “egoic patterns” is one model akin to certain psychological frameworks (e.g., CBT’s “automatic negative thoughts”). “Purification” is a metaphor for reducing these unhelpful impulses. Standard therapy or mindfulness can indeed achieve similar ends. Our model integrates those ideas with a storyline that resonates with some, but it’s optional to frame it spiritually.\n3. Comparison Table: Secular/Generic vs. Sufi/Islamic Framing\nBelow is a side-by-side that shows how these insights appear in two different layers: a universal or agnostic layer and a Sufi layer.\n\nAspect\tSecular/Generic Framing\tSufi/Islamic Framing\nTerminology\t“Egoic patterns,” “inner sense of wonder,” “deeper inspiration”\t“Lower nafs,” “qalb (heart) witnessing,” “divine names,” “infinite potential,” “fitrah”\nWhy Non-Instrumental Attention?\tHumans have a direct sense of beauty/meaning, tested through daily observation (inner experiment)\tWe possess a fitrah from Allah; the heart naturally recognizes divine qualities (e.g., Rahmah, Jamal), leading to inherently meaningful (ihsani) acts\nMechanism of Recognition\tA “heartfelt resonance” or “embodied sense” of alignment or synergy\tQalb’s direct witnessing (mushahada) of divine attributes in the world/oneself. “God is Beautiful and loves beauty.” (Sahih Muslim, hadith reference)\nNature of Ego\t“Autopilot/habit loops shaped by fear, desire, social norms”\t“Nafs ammārah/nafs lawwāmah” (lower self prone to blame, impulse) vs. “purified nafs” guided by the heart and God’s light (Qur’an 12:53, referencing the “soul that enjoins evil”)\nGrowth Process\tShift from anxiety-driven or social compliance to living by chosen, tested values\tMove from Islam (outer discipline) → Iman (internal faith/unity) → Ihsan (excellence/beauty, as if seeing God) (Hadith Jibril in Sahih Bukhari)\nPractice Examples\tObserving “beauty walks,” “meaningful action checks,” mindful reflection\tDhikr (remembrance), muhasabah (self-examination), muraqabah (awareness of God’s presence), culminating in witnessing God’s names in each moment (Qur’an 13:28: “Hearts find rest...” )\nCollective Dimension\tEmergent synergy from shared sense of wonder or moral learning\t“We will show them Our signs in the horizons and in themselves...” (Qur’an 41:53).

Concepts and Their Quranic/Hadith Basis\nLower Nafs:\n\nQur’an 12:53 mentions that the nafs “certainly incites to evil” unless guided.\nGoal: Understand this “egoic” impulse, not to hate it but to refine it.\nHeart (Qalb):\n\nQur’an 22:46: “Travel through the land... have hearts with which to understand.”\nHadith: The heart is a “vessel for knowledge,” perceiving beyond mere data.\nDivine Names:\n\n“And to Allah belong the best names, so invoke Him by them.” (Qur’an 7:180)\nEach name points to a universal quality (mercy, justice, compassion) that can be reflected in human actions.\nFitrah:\n\nHadith: “Every child is born upon fitrah (natural purity)...” (Sahih Muslim).\nThis suggests an innate orientation to the Real, not learned from society but overshadowed by worldly attachments.\nStages: Islam → Iman → Ihsan:\n\nHadith of Jibril (Sahih Bukhari), describing external submission (Islam), internal conviction (Iman), and spiritual excellence (Ihsan: worship as though seeing God).\nB. Sufi-Structured Flow\nIslam (External Framework)\n\nBasic discipline: doing “the right action,” akin to adopting some structure so the lower nafs can’t run wild.\nIn the framework: Start with daily “check-in” that ensures we’re not purely in autopilot.\nIman (Inner Belief/Shift)\n\nRealizing life is not random; everything is a sign of deeper reality.\nIn the framework: Accepting that non-instrumental meaning is real, exploring how “beauty” or “mercy” is recognized in everyday moments.\nIhsan (Excellence/Beauty)\n\nLiving as if witnessing the Divine in each situation, so your “attentional policies” spontaneously align with God’s names (compassion, generosity, justice).\nIn the framework: Tension resolution becomes an act of “Which name is calling me to act now? Mercy, truth, patience, creativity?”\nC. Additional Sufi Practices\nDhikr (Remembrance)\nRepetitive utterance of a short phrase or a “quality” (e.g., “Ya Rahman” for Compassion). This parallels mindful recollection of your CAP in the daily flow.\nMuhasabah (Self-Accountability)\nEnd-of-day reflection, “How did I embody or neglect these qualities?” This maps to the “End-of-Day Reflection & Gratitude” step.\nMuraqabah (Watchfulness)\nMaintaining a sense that your every breath might reflect or obstruct the divine attribute. This fosters an acute sense of whether you’re in IAP or CAP.\n5. Sufi-Based Coaching Methodology\nAim: To help a seeker progress from egoic patterns (nafs) toward heartfelt living (ihsan), guided by divine names recognized in daily choices.\n\nStep 1: Initial Spiritual Connection\nGreet the user with a gentle invocation (e.g., “In the name of the Most Compassionate”).\nAsk them to recall a moment they felt that “breath” of compassion or beauty. Let them label it in everyday language (or a name of God if they are comfortable).\nStep 2: Identifying the Egoic Pressure\nEncourage them to see a “push” or tension: fear, pride, or social pressure. They label it as “I want to look good,” or “I’m anxious about finances.”\nConnect it to the concept of nafs: it’s a universal phenomenon, not shameful but something to refine.\nStep 3: Introducing a Divine Name or Quality\nSuggest a relevant name: Mercy, Patience, Generosity, based on the user’s situation.\nAsk them: “When you sense that name, how does your heart react? Where do you feel it in your body?”\nStep 4: Daily Practice (Dhikr or Affirmation)\nThey can adopt a short phrase or “remembrance,” e.g. “Mercy in each breath,” repeated silently a few times a day.\nThey track how it shifts their perspective in tension moments.\nStep 5: Tension Resolution through Divine Quality\nIn daily conflicts, ask: “Which of God’s attributes do you feel you could reflect here? Justice, Compassion, Beauty, Truth?”\nLet them pick a small action that aligns with that chosen attribute.\nStep 6: Weekly Check-In (Muhasabah)\nEncourage them to do an end-of-week reflection: “Did you notice any changes? Times you overcame the nafs? Times you felt more ‘heart-centered’?”\nThey measure their sense of alignment from 1–10. They note new patterns.\n6. A Coaching Prompt (Sufi Version)\nBelow is a sample prompt or script a Sufi-oriented coach might use in conversation with a user. It mirrors the “meaning alignment assistant” approach but integrates references to spiritual qualities (without heavy dogma):\n\nCoach (warmly):\n“Peace to you. Let’s begin by taking a gentle breath. Can you recall a recent moment that felt purely kind or beautiful to you—without seeking reward or praise?\n\n(Wait for response. Reflect empathically.)\n\nNotice how that feels in your heart. We often call that a breath of Divine mercy or beauty. If you prefer another word, that’s fine. But the point is, it wasn’t about outcome—it was meaningful in itself.\n\nNow, I’d love for you to share one place you’re feeling tension—maybe your responsibilities, personal anxieties, or a sense of pride. In our tradition, we sometimes call that an impulse of the nafs, the part that can overshadow our heart’s clarity. Where does that show up for you?\n\n(Listen carefully. Summarize)\n\nWonderful. So you sense a push to do X out of fear or pride, yet your deeper capacity for, say, Rahmah (Compassion) or Sabr (Patience) is gently calling you. Let’s create a small plan: next time that tension arises, can you pause, remember that name or quality, and see if a more beautiful response appears?\n\nWe’ll note this in your daily check-in. If you get stuck or anxious, no problem—just see if you can come back to your heart’s sense of that name or that subtle sense of ease. We’ll talk next time about how it went, inshaAllah.\n\n(Offer a brief reflection)\n\nGreat. If you have any questions or get overwhelmed, remember you can do a short grounding: place your hand on your chest and softly recall that we are always connected to these universal qualities, just sometimes hidden. I’m here to support you in letting them shine.”\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAgnostics can adopt a purely “notice the difference between autopilot and heartfelt living” approach, calling these “higher values or universal qualities.”\nMuslims or Sufis can interpret these same qualities as God’s names, the potential for ihsan, and the path of polishing the heart.\nEither way, the system holds a universal method for daily alignment with deeper meaning—backed by centuries of spiritual tradition or simply personal experimentation."

      "content": " Let me ask 5 key questions to help align CAPs/IAPs with witnessing of divine names/qualities in a universal way:\n\n1. ATTENTION & QUALITIES:\nCan each CAP be seen as a way of noticing and embodying a universal quality (mercy, wisdom, beauty, etc.)? If so, could we map common attentional patterns to these qualities in a way that's both precise and universally accessible?\n\n2. SCANNING & WITNESSING:\nWhen we scan anxiously for threats or opportunities (IAPs), are we blocking our ability to witness deeper qualities? If so, how exactly does this mechanism work - what's the relationship between instrumental scanning and receptive witnessing?\n\n3. TRANSFORMATION PATTERN:\nIs there an elegant pattern where each type of instrumental attention (security, status, achievement) could open into witnessing a corresponding quality? For example:\n- Security scanning → Witnessing protection/care\n- Status seeking → Witnessing dignity/worth  \n- Achievement drive → Witnessing creative power\n\n4. STRUCTURE & LANGUAGE:\nHow can we structure attention policies to capture both the instrumental need and the deeper quality, while keeping Joe's precise format? For example:\n```\nFrom IAP:\n\"REACTIONS suggesting judgment from others\"\n\nTo CAP:\n\"MOMENTS where dignity naturally expresses itself\"\n```\n\n5. INTEGRATION & PRACTICE:\nWhat practices could help people experience how instrumental attention can open into witnessing deeper qualities? How do we make this shift experientially real rather than just conceptual?\n\nWould you like to explore any of these questions, or should I ask different ones to help us better integrate IAPs, CAPs and qualities of being (divine names)?\n\nI sense there's an elegant pattern here where every instrumental scanning mode could transform into witnessing a corresponding deeper quality, but we need to get the structure and language precise.",
