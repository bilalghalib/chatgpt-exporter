People in the ecosystem, suppliers, green practices from heritage design, inspiration from people's values, the ideas of people in Mosul not being open to being the first person to try something. They would like other people to try it first, and then they would copycat, and how to work on cultural adaptation and coming up with ways to have it be culturally appropriate and relevant. All of these different things I'd like to extract, but there are multiple stages. The first, I'd like to keep it super generic so that I can use a very similar process for other extraction methodologies. And so I would like to give it my goals and my description of what I'm learning so far, and give it sort of an overview of all the different files that I'm going to give it. And then from there, I'd like it to have an agnostic way of digesting it. And since I'm building this for me, I'd like to see how to build it for, in a way that other people can benefit from the same process. Either people that are working in, you know, documentary filmmaking or other qualitative data analysis fields. Yeah.",

      "content": "# **Computational Discovery of Purpose and Values in Text**  \n\n## Introduction: Beyond Extracting “What” to Uncovering “Why”  \nModern AI and text-mining techniques excel at extracting factual knowledge – the **what** – from documents. However, they struggle with uncovering the implicit purposive structures: the **why** (goals and intentions) and **what for** (values and motivations) that underlie human-generated content. In knowledge representation terms, every structured ontology or taxonomy we create implicitly reflects human agreements and motives. As Tom Gruber famously put it, *“Every ontology is a treaty – a social agreement – among people with some common motive in sharing.”*【27†L7-L11】. This indicates that behind explicit knowledge artifacts lie tacit teleological and axiological commitments – purposes and values that people assume rather than state. The core research question is how we can **automatically discover these latent “why” structures from text without imposing preconceived categories**. Solving this would move AI from merely cataloging facts to performing a kind of *computational hermeneutics* – interpreting meaning in context as humans do, but at scale. This capability is crucial for domains like qualitative research, where insights often come from understanding stakeholders’ goals, fears, and values rather than just the surface facts. In practical terms, such a system could read interview transcripts or open-ended responses and tease out emergent themes like “community pride as a motivator” or “hesitancy to be first adopter,” which might otherwise remain implicit. \n\n## Limitations of Current Knowledge Extraction Approaches  \nExisting text analysis methods provide building blocks but fall short of automatically finding purpose and value structures:  \n\n- **Ontology Learning:** Early work on *ontology learning* (e.g. Maedche & Staab, 2001) showed how to extract concepts and relations from text to build taxonomies【18†L1-L9】. These algorithms can derive *what entities exist and how they relate*, but not *why those entities or facts matter*. The focus is on **ontological commitments** (shared vocabularies and assumptions about what exists【29†L135-L143】) rather than teleological commitments. For example, an ontology learning tool might read architecture interviews and identify terms like *“solar panels”* and *“insulation”* and relationships (e.g. *“solar panels –is a– technology”*), but it won’t articulate the *purpose* (e.g. *“solar panels are aimed at energy independence”*) or the *value judgment* behind an opinion (e.g. *“cultural heritage is valued over modern design”*).  \n\n- **Topic Modeling and Clustering:** Statistical approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) discover latent topics by grouping words frequently found together. This is useful to find recurring **themes**, but those themes are surface-level and lack context of intent or importance. As one survey notes, *“existing work tends to rely on topic modeling to extract key topics that represent the data”*, essentially clustering documents by prevalent terms【13†L88-L96】. For instance, topic modeling on our interviews might find themes like *“renewable energy”* vs. *“traditional materials”*, but it won’t tell us *which themes are pursued as goals or avoided as concerns*. Pure clustering similarly groups text by similarity (sometimes using semantic embeddings or even sentiment【13†L90-L97】) and can hint at emergent categories, but these categories are typically **descriptive** (what people talk about) rather than **purposive** (why they talk about it).  \n\n- **Knowledge Acquisition & Manual Coding:** Traditional **knowledge engineering** relies on *manual elicitation* of expert knowledge and coding of texts according to a schema (Studer, Benjamins & Fensel, 1998). Techniques like interviews, card sorting, and knowledge graphs built by hand allow domain experts to make implicit knowledge explicit. However, this is labor-intensive and inherently guided by the experts’ pre-existing mental models【11†L39-L48】【11†L50-L58】. In qualitative research, methods such as **Grounded Theory** (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) and manual **thematic analysis** (Braun & Clarke, 2006) require humans to read transcripts, perform open coding (assign codes to excerpts), cluster those codes into higher-level categories, and iteratively refine them. While this human-driven process can uncover deeper meanings (researchers notice *“participants are reluctant to be first adopters”* and create a code for that), it does not scale easily to large datasets. More importantly, it’s difficult to ensure that the structures discovered are not biased by the researcher’s own lens – one researcher might notice cultural values, another might focus on economic motives, depending on their prior framework. In short, manual methods can discover purposes and values (tacit knowledge) but **lack computational efficiency and reproducibility**.  \n\n**Gap:** None of these existing approaches directly addresses **“purpose mining”** – the automated discovery of the why/what-for in content. Ontology learning finds entities, topic models find word clusters, and even advanced information extraction focuses on factual relations or event sequences (the *how*). They typically **impose a structure** (an ontology, a set of topics, a codebook) rather than let the structure *emerge from the data* in a domain-agnostic way. What’s missing is a method to algorithmically surface *teleological structures* (goals, intents) and *axiological structures* (values, principles) that are implicit in text, **without predefining a taxonomy of possible goals or values**. We want the software to answer, *“What underlying purposes, motivations, or value judgments can be inferred from this content – and how are they organized?”* \n\n## Emerging Directions: Toward Purpose and Value Extraction  \nRecognizing this gap, researchers from various fields have started inching toward capturing the “why” in data, albeit in domain-specific ways. A few notable directions include:  \n\n- **Human Values in Text:** In NLP and computational social science, there is growing interest in detecting human values and moral perspectives from text. For example, the recent **ValueEval** initiative (SemEval 2023 Task 4) created a dataset of 9,324 arguments annotated for presence of human values (like security, tradition, equality, etc.)【22†L141-L149】. These arguments, drawn from sources as diverse as social media, political debates, and religious texts, were labeled using a taxonomy derived from social-scientific theories of values (Schwartz’s value inventory, Rokeach’s values, etc.)【22†L171-L179】【22†L179-L187】. This shows that it is possible to train machine learning models (including fine-tuned transformers) to identify when a piece of text invokes certain *predefined* values. Indeed, top-performing models in that task (using ensembles of fine-tuned transformers like DeBERTa) achieved solid accuracy in multi-label classification of values. However, the limitation is clear: the **values must be pre-specified** (e.g. a fixed list such as “tradition, benevolence, achievement, security, etc.”). The model can then detect if any of those appear, but it won’t *discover new value categories* not in the list. In other words, this approach *imposes a categorical framework* (drawn from psychology), whereas our goal is to let the value structure emerge from the content itself. That said, the existence of such datasets and models is encouraging – it means with the right training data or prompt, AI can recognize nuanced value-laden language (for instance, identifying that an interviewee’s statement “*I want my home to honor my ancestors*” aligns with the value of *tradition* or *familial respect*).  \n\n- **Argumentation and Purpose:** Another relevant thread is **argument mining** and **goal recognition** in text. Some research in computational argumentation looks at *why people argue for something*, linking arguments to underlying goals or preferences. For instance, value-based argumentation frameworks (Bench-Capon, 2003) explicitly tie the strength of an argument to the audience’s values【22†L183-L190】. There have also been efforts to parse texts for statements of intent or causal motivations – for example, identifying phrases that signal cause-effect or purpose (“*X because Y*”, “*in order to* …). Classic NLP can catch explicit causal connectives, but many purposes are implicit. Recent transformer-based models, with their large knowledge base, can sometimes infer implicit goals (for example, given a narrative, a model might infer *“Character A did Y in order to gain trust”* even if not stated verbatim). There is also work on **moral narrative analysis** and **persona modeling**: for example, identifying the goals of characters in a story or the *values a persona endorses* (as in ValueNet for dialogues【21†L37-L40】). Again, these often rely on some predefined schema of possible goals/values.  \n\n- **Value-Sensitive Design & Domain Context:** In fields like human-computer interaction, **value-sensitive design** (Friedman, 1996) has long argued that technologies should be built with stakeholders’ values in mind. While not computational, this perspective highlights that every artifact or piece of content has a context of purpose and value. Philosophers of technology like Peter Kroes have analyzed how **teleology of artifacts** (the intended function or purpose of a tool) can be described, and critical theorists like Andrew Feenberg have noted how technologies reflect the values of their creators or users. These ideas motivate *what* to look for – e.g. “find where the text indicates the intended function of a tool (teleology)” or “identify expressions of users’ preferences or concerns (axiology).” They underscore **why it’s important** to capture purposive structures: if we ignore them, we risk misinterpreting the knowledge. For instance, an engineering report might list features (facts) but the *reason* a feature exists (value like safety or cost-saving) could be lost if not explicitly noted.  \n\nIn summary, current research provides **pieces of the puzzle** – methods for extracting structured knowledge, classifying text by known value categories, and conceptual frameworks about purposes – but no unified approach yet that *discovers arbitrary purposive structures from any corpus*. This is the challenge our research and tool development aims to tackle. \n\n## Leveraging Large Language Models to Uncover Implicit Structures  \nA promising development that could bridge this gap is the advent of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** (e.g. GPT-4, PaLM, LLaMA). These models, trained on billions of words of human language, have a remarkable ability to capture patterns, contexts, and even implied meanings. They represent a significant leap beyond earlier NLP in a few ways that are relevant to purpose/value discovery:  \n\n- **Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Reasoning:** Unlike classical supervised methods, LLMs can perform complex annotation tasks with little to no task-specific training. Researchers have found that models like ChatGPT can, out-of-the-box, do tasks like *relevance scoring, stance detection, and even frame identification* at a level comparable to or better than crowd-workers【11†L60-L68】【11†L118-L126】. This suggests that an LLM *already “knows” a lot about common human motives and values* from its training data. For example, if prompted correctly, an LLM might recognize that a sentence like *“We chose clay walls because they keep the house cool naturally”* implies an underlying purpose of *sustainability* or *energy efficiency*. This is knowledge it has likely absorbed from reading many texts where people explained such decisions. We can leverage this by asking LLMs directly to identify goals or values in text segments (*“What is the speaker’s goal here?”* or *“Does this text express any particular concern or value?”*). Early explorations are encouraging: Chew et al. (2023) demonstrated that GPT-3.5 could perform **deductive coding** (applying a given codeframe to text) with agreement rates comparable to human coders in many cases【11†L27-L34】. If LLMs can follow *pre-defined* codes well, it stands to reason they could also help **suggest codes** in the first place.  \n\n- **Inductive Thematic Analysis with LLMs:** A number of very recent studies have started using LLMs to assist in **inductive qualitative analysis**, where the categories emerge from data. Stefano De Paoli (2023-2024) and others have conducted experiments using ChatGPT or similar models to perform *thematic analysis* on interview transcripts【9†L58-L66】【9†L67-L75】. In these studies, the LLM is prompted to act like a qualitative analyst: first generating initial open codes for segments of text, then grouping those into themes. Notably, De Paoli’s approach emphasizes *open-ended prompts* that **do not provide the model with any predetermined codes**, instead relying on the model’s understanding of “thematic analysis” terminology and process【9†L58-L66】. For example, rather than asking the model *“Does this sentence talk about cost, environment, or culture?”* (closed coding), the prompt might be *“List anything this sentence could be about, in the respondent’s own terms.”* The LLM thus might output codes in the participant’s language (e.g. *“don’t want to be the first to try”* as a code). Those codes can then be aggregated. Early results show that **LLM-generated themes can overlap strongly with human-generated ones**, though the process isn’t perfect. One study proposes a *human–LLM collaboration* loop: a human coder and an LLM iteratively refine the codebook together【13†L19-L27】【13†L56-L64】. The human reviews and adjusts AI-suggested codes, and the AI then helps group and discuss them. Remarkably, in case studies on survey data, this *LLM-in-the-loop* method achieved coding quality (measured by inter-annotator agreement) comparable to two trained human coders working together【13†L23-L28】【13†L71-L79】. This suggests that, with proper guidance, LLMs can indeed extract meaningful structures **without a predefined schema**, essentially performing a computational grounded theory procedure.  \n\n【16†embed_image】 *A human–LLM collaborative framework for qualitative analysis.* *In this illustrative workflow (from Dai et al. 2023), a **Machine Coder (LLM)** works with a **Human Coder** to conduct thematic analysis【13†L56-L64】. The LLM is prompted to generate initial codes from text, then group similar codes into candidate themes. The human and LLM then **iterate** – discussing and refining the codes and themes until consensus (a step akin to researcher triangulation). Finally, the agreed codebook is used to annotate the data, and the quality is evaluated (e.g. via inter-annotator agreement)【13†L58-L66】【13†L71-L79】. Studies have found that this approach can produce coding results comparable to traditional manual analysis, while greatly reducing labor and time【13†L19-L27】.* \n\n- **Chain-of-Thought and Reasoning Abilities:** LLMs can be guided to **explain their reasoning** (through prompts like “Let’s think step by step”). This means they can potentially justify why a piece of text might imply a certain purpose or value. For example, if an interview excerpt says *“I don’t want to install solar panels because no one else in my neighborhood has them yet,”* an LLM might reason: *“The speaker’s hesitation is due to not wanting to be the first (a fear of standing out or risk) – this suggests a cultural value of conformity or avoiding risk.”* This kind of interpretative leap is what a human analyst might do; getting an AI to do it is essentially computational hermeneutics in action. Researchers haven’t solved this completely (and we must beware of AI “hallucinating” interpretations that aren’t justified), but prompt-engineering techniques are improving. There is work (e.g. by Gao et al., 2023) on user interfaces that let analysts see the rationale behind an LLM’s coding suggestions, so the analyst can decide if it’s sensible【13†L100-L108】. Harnessing chain-of-thought could allow the tool to present *evidence* for a hypothesized purpose (e.g. quoting the phrases that led it to infer a certain goal), which helps with validation and trust.  \n\n**Caveats:** While LLMs are powerful, they are not magic truth-tellers. They come with challenges: **bias and false inference**. Because an LLM is trained on general internet data, it might inject stereotypes or biases when interpreting purposes. Ashwin et al. (2023) found that using GPT-4 to annotate interviews introduced systematic biases – the errors weren’t random but correlated with demographic attributes of the interviewees【7†L55-L63】. For example, the LLM might have (mis)interpreted responses from certain groups in a biased way, perhaps due to stereotypes present in its training data. They concluded that if one has enough human-coded data to detect such bias, it may be safer to train a smaller supervised model on those annotations than to rely on the LLM’s zero-shot annotations【7†L59-L63】. In our context, this means we should use LLM insights as *a starting point* or assistant, but **retain human oversight**, especially when extracting sensitive purposive information (like inferring people’s values from what they say – a delicate task). The LLM might also “hallucinate” purposes that sound plausible but aren’t actually supported by the text. Therefore, a key part of our approach is designing prompts and workflows that keep the AI grounded in the data (e.g. *“quote the part of the text that supports this inference”*). Despite these challenges, the consensus emerging in 2024 research is that **LLMs, used carefully, can greatly accelerate qualitative analysis**. They can do the first-pass pattern detection that humans then refine – aligning perfectly with the three-step *Computational Grounded Theory* framework: *pattern detection → pattern refinement → pattern confirmation*【2†L32-L40】【2†L38-L45】.\n\n## Methodological Framework for Discovering Teleological and Axiological Structures  \nBringing it all together, we can outline a concrete **multi-stage methodology** to computationally discover purposive knowledge structures from a corpus (such as the expert interviews on green architecture in Mosul that you are analyzing). The approach marries unsupervised discovery techniques with LLM-based interpretation, and crucially, keeps the process **domain-agnostic** so it can be reused for other qualitative datasets. Below is a step-by-step framework:  \n\n1. **Corpus Familiarization and Goal Setting:** Although we want to avoid imposing categories, it’s important to begin with clarity on the *analyst’s goals*. This means the human researcher (you) should articulate what you hope to learn from the texts. In your case, goals might include *“Identify key challenges and motivations around sustainable building in this context,”* *“Find any cultural attitudes affecting adoption,”* and *“Gather practical solutions or unanswered questions mentioned by experts.”* This isn’t a codebook, just a mission statement. An LLM can even be fed a summary of these goals so that it has context on what might count as an “insight” or “purpose” – effectively guiding it to be on the lookout for those phenomena. This is akin to how a human analyst reads with certain research questions in mind. **However, we do not give the AI a list of codes or categories upfront** – we only give it the general project description and perhaps a short overview of the interview set (e.g. “We have 20 interviews with architects, engineers, and residents about green building practices in Mosul”). This sets the stage without prejudicing specific answers.  \n\n2. **Pattern Detection (Automated Open Coding):** In this phase, we leverage computational tools to surface *candidate snippets and concepts* that might indicate purposes or values. There are two complementary routes to do this:  \n\n   - **LLM-Based Open Coding:** We can prompt an LLM to read each interview transcript (or smaller chunks if the interviews are long) and generate a set of *“codes” or summary points* for each chunk. The prompt might be: *“Summarize the main points the speaker is making, especially any reasons, goals, or values they mention (either explicitly or implicitly). Use the speaker’s own words where possible in the codes.”* The model might return a list like: _Code1: “not wanting to be the first to try” (hesitation to pioneer)_; _Code2: “importance of showing respect for heritage” (value traditional aesthetics)_; _Code3: “needing proof that new methods work elsewhere” (desire for proven solutions)_; etc. Notice how some codes are fairly explicit in the text (the speaker said they don’t want to be first), while others are slightly more interpretive (inferring the value of heritage). At this stage, we accept a wide net – it’s fine if some codes are off-mark, because we’ll refine them later. We do this for each document, yielding an initial **open coding of the entire corpus**.  \n\n   - **Unsupervised Text Clustering:** In parallel, or as a backup, we can use embedding-based methods to cluster semantically similar pieces of text. For instance, using a tool like BERTopic or sentence transformers, represent each interview sentence or paragraph as a vector and cluster them. The idea is that sentences discussing similar underlying issues will cluster together, even if they use different words. For example, a sentence “*I wish someone else would try it first*” and “*People here wait for others to adopt new ideas*” might cluster, indicating a theme about *risk aversion or social proof*. These clusters can hint at latent topics or concerns. Unlike LDA which outputs abstract topics, clustering gives you groups of actual excerpts, which you can then read to interpret the common thread. This is an unsupervised way to catch patterns that the LLM might miss or to validate the LLM’s suggestions.  \n\n   After this step, you will have a plethora of raw codes and clusters – essentially a candidate pool of potential purposes, values, insights, and stories. It will be far more than the final set, so next we condense and refine.  \n\n3. **Pattern Refinement (Human–AI Synthesis):** This is a critical interpretive phase where human insight and AI assistance converge. You would review the auto-generated codes and clusters to combine redundancies and filter out noise. If the LLM produced a hundred distinct codes across all transcripts, likely many overlap or are trivial. For example, you might notice 10 different phrasings all relate to *“hesitancy to be a first-mover”*. You’d merge those into a single theme (perhaps named “Community Hesitation to Pioneer” as a teleological insight about adoption behavior). Similarly, several codes might fall under a broader value like “Sustainability pride” vs “Economic practicality” etc. You can also drop codes that seem irrelevant or erroneous. During this process, an LLM can assist in a few ways:  \n\n   - **Clustering & Merging Suggestions:** You can feed the list of codes back into the LLM and ask it to group them or suggest categories. For example: *“Here are 15 codes from the interviews. Group them into 3-5 themes and name each theme.”* Given its ability to see semantic commonalities, the LLM might output something like: _Theme A: “Cultural and Social Adoption Barriers” (codes X, Y, Z); Theme B: “Environmental Motivations and Pride”; Theme C: “Knowledge Gaps and Unanswered Questions”_. These suggestions give you a starting point for how to organize the codes. You, as the human expert, can then adjust these groupings – ensuring they make sense given the domain context. This addresses the **representation question**: how to formally represent purposive structures. The answer might be a hierarchical codeframe or an ontology where top-level nodes are broader purposive themes (goals, barriers, values) and child nodes are specific instances or sub-themes. The representation should be rich enough to capture nuance (e.g. distinguish “aesthetic heritage” from “community identity” as separate values, even if both are cultural) but still structured for computation (like a tree or graph).  \n\n   - **Iterative Prompting (Validation):** As you refine, you can iteratively validate with the model. For instance, after settling on a codebook of themes, you might ask the LLM: *“Given this refined list of themes with definitions, re-code Interview 5 and highlight any quotes that exemplify each theme.”* This checks whether the themes are clear and grounded. If the LLM struggles to apply a category or confuses two categories, that may indicate those themes are too ambiguous or overlapping. This aligns with how we validate qualitatively – akin to checking inter-coder reliability, but here the “other coder” is the AI. Recent research suggests even metrics like **thematic saturation** (seeing if new data yields new themes or not) can be adapted to AI-assisted analysis【9†L138-L147】. If adding a new interview causes the LLM to propose a brand-new theme that never appeared before, perhaps our dataset wasn’t saturated or the theme was truly novel – either way, we examine if it’s valid or a one-off.  \n\n   Throughout this refinement, we maintain an **open mind**: the goal is not to force everything into a pre-set theoretical framework, but to allow a structure to emerge that best fits the data. It’s a dynamic dance between human intuition and machine pattern-spotting. By the end of this phase, we expect to have (a) a set of well-defined **purposive themes** – e.g. categories like *“Fear of Unproven Solutions”*, *“Value of Ancestral Techniques”*, *“Aspiration for Energy Independence”*, etc. – and (b) a mapping of where in the data each theme occurs (supporting quotes, stories, cases). Some themes will indeed correspond to *teleology* (stated goals or intended functions), others to *axiology* (values and principles), and some to emergent *ontological* groupings (key concepts unique to the domain).  \n\n4. **Pattern Confirmation and Representation:** This stage addresses how to formally represent and validate the discovered structures for use and reuse. Once the themes and relationships are set, we might formalize them into a knowledge base. One way is to create a **purpose-aware ontology or knowledge graph**. In such a graph, we could have nodes of type *“Goal”*, *“Value”*, *“Challenge”*, etc., connected to other entities or to each other. For example, a *Goal* node “Reduce electricity costs” might be linked to a *Value* node “economic self-sufficiency” (if the interviews imply that value motivates the goal), and to an *Action/Idea* node “install solar panels”. Similarly, a *Challenge* node “Community Hesitation to Pioneer” might connect to a *Cause* node “Risk aversion culture” (a value-related cause). This graph can be as simple or complex as needed, but the key is it encodes not just facts but *purposive relations* (like a causal or intent graph). It maintains semantic richness (we can attach excerpts or context to each node as justification) while being computationally tractable (a graph or ontology can be queried, visualized, extended). Think of it as an **ontology enriched with teleology and axiology**. In fact, some research in requirements engineering and cognitive science has used goal-modeling notations (like i* frameworks or concept maps) to represent such structures.  \n\n   Another representation approach is narrative or **thematic maps**. These are diagrams where themes are nodes and lines indicate connections or influences. Qualitative researchers often draw these by hand. With our pipeline, we could have the AI generate a thematic map. De Paoli (2024) experimented with **thematic maps from LLM-derived themes**【9†L67-L75】. For example, the AI might suggest visualizing that “Cultural Barriers” overlaps with “Lack of Trust in New Tech” for a certain demographic, indicating those two themes co-occur often.  \n\n【17†embed_image】 *An example of representing extracted values as an interconnected network.* *This semantic network (from Mark Alfano’s “Value Mining” project) shows virtues and values found in a corpus of texts (here, obituaries in a community) and their interconnections【15†L66-L74】. Nodes represent specific values or virtues attributed to people, and links indicate co-occurrence or association (e.g. **kindness** closely connected with **community service**). Such graph-based visualizations help maintain semantic richness – we see clusters of related values – while remaining computationally usable (the network can be analyzed with graph algorithms). In our context, a similar approach could map out, say, **sustainability**, **affordability**, and **cultural heritage** as key values, and show which goals or stories link to each.*  \n\n   Representing the knowledge in such structured forms also facilitates **reuse by others**. For instance, documentary filmmakers or other researchers could take your “purpose network” and explore it, or even plug it into a question-answering system. The formal research proposition you outlined – *“Purpose-Aware Knowledge Representation”* – would likely involve defining an ontology extension for “purposive structures” so that any content domain can be annotated in this way. This is a novel contribution: most ontologies don’t natively include nodes for “motive” or “value” (they tend to focus on objects and processes). We are essentially proposing to enrich knowledge graphs with an extra dimension that captures the *teleological layer* of knowledge.  \n\n5. **Validation and Evaluation:** A recurring question is *“How do we know the extracted purposes and values are *correct* and not just artifacts of the AI or our biases?”* Validation should be both **quantitative** and **qualitative**. Quantitatively, if a subset of data has been human-coded (or if you perform a manual thematic analysis in parallel on a sample), we can measure overlap with the AI-driven results – similar to how one measures inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa, etc.) between two human coders. If our system discovers 10 major themes and a human expert had independently identified 8 of those, that’s a good sign (especially if the 2 extra from the system are genuinely insightful and not nonsense). Qualitatively, we must assess *meaningfulness*: do domain experts agree that these inferred goals/values are present and important? One could conduct *member checking* by going back to some interviewees or subject-matter experts and showing them the summarized purposive structures: *“The analysis found that ‘honoring heritage’ is a key value motivating decisions – do you agree or did we overstate that?”* Their feedback would indicate if we captured real tacit themes or if we over-interpreted. Another approach from grounded theory is checking *theoretical saturation*: if we shuffle or split the data, do we end up with similar themes? If adding more data doesn’t yield new main themes, it suggests we’ve covered the thematic space well【9†L138-L147】. Lastly, one could try predictive validation: use the discovered structure to make a prediction or decision and see if it holds. For example, if “fear of being first” is a discovered barrier, a prediction might be that *no one will volunteer to pilot a new green technology in that community*, which could be tested via a small experiment or further inquiry. Accurate predictions would boost confidence that the structure reflects reality.  \n\nBy combining these evaluation methods, we address the **validation question**: ensuring we are reflecting the content’s implicit structures and not merely projecting our own. It’s a delicate process – the very nature of hermeneutic interpretation is that it’s subjective – but with multiple validators (human and machine, different data splits, etc.), we can triangulate on the most solid findings. \n\n## Toward Generalizable Patterns and Computational Hermeneutics  \nOne exciting aspect of this line of research is the possibility of discovering **domain-invariant patterns** of purposive organization. Humans, regardless of domain, often organize knowledge in analogous ways when it comes to “why.” For example, narratives in healthcare, education, or technology adoption might all reveal a tension between *innovators* and *conservative adopters*, which is a teleological pattern (goal of innovation vs. goal of safety/tradition). By applying our methodology across domains, we can begin to see such meta-patterns. Perhaps there are a handful of fundamental “purpose archetypes” – like *quest for improvement*, *resistance due to risk*, *value of community*, *value of autonomy*, etc. – that recur in many contexts. Identifying those could be a contribution to social science and cognitive science, shedding light on how humans structure understanding regardless of topic. This addresses the **generalization question**: we’d examine if the same approach, with minimal tuning, can extract meaningful purposive structures from, say, interviews with educators about pedagogy, forum discussions among software developers, or historical narratives in journalism. If yes, what common structures emerge? We might find, for instance, that **teleological statements** often follow certain linguistic patterns (like justification clauses) across domains, or that **axiological expressions** (value statements) cluster around certain adjectives and metaphors (e.g. cleanliness associated with morality in disparate texts). These could inform more generalized AI models that look for purpose and value markers in any text. \n\nUltimately, what we are aiming for is a kind of **computational hermeneutics** – using computing to interpret text in a way that respects the *human meaning*. This means moving beyond treating text as bags of words or even as abstract semantic graphs, and instead engaging with text more like an analyst or even a philosopher would: considering intentions, contexts, and implications. Our proposed research explicitly draws on theories from phenomenology and pragmatism, which emphasize that meaning is tied to human intention and practical context. By incorporating those insights (e.g. *“meaning emerges through use and intention”*), we guide our algorithms to look for the footprints of intention in language. If successful, this approach will allow AI to answer not just factual questions like *“What is said about solar panels?”* but higher-order questions like *“Why are people in this community interested (or not interested) in solar panels?”* and *“What values do they associate with solar energy or traditional building?”*. That is a significant leap toward AI systems that can truly assist in sensemaking, not just information retrieval.\n\n## Conclusion: Implications and Future Directions  \nThis research program – **“Computational Discovery of Purposive Knowledge Structures”** – stands to benefit both the theory and practice of knowledge management and AI. From a theoretical standpoint, it pushes the boundary on how we represent knowledge: framing knowledge not as static facts but as a living network of goals, values, and contextual truths. It operationalizes the idea that *knowledge is not just a map of what is, but also a guide to what matters and where it’s going*. In practical terms, the tools and methods developed here could be transformative for anyone who works with large amounts of qualitative or unstructured text: policy analysts, design researchers, ethnographers, business analysts, etc. Instead of manually sifting through hundreds of interviews or documents, they could use a purpose-aware analysis tool to quickly surface *the key insights, the stories that illustrate those insights, the open questions people have, and the values driving decisions*. In your case, this means accelerating the extraction of rich insights from interviews about green architecture – turning a tangle of transcripts into an organized, queryable body of knowledge (e.g. “Show me all the cultural factors mentioned across interviews” or “What motivations do engineers cite for using traditional materials?”). Moreover, because our approach keeps the process generic, it can be shared and applied in other domains with minimal changes – fulfilling your vision of a reusable methodology for others like documentary filmmakers or community organizers who often deal with narratives and need to extract learnings. \n\nThere will still be challenges ahead. Ensuring that the AI’s “discoveries” are credible and not artifacts will require careful user interfaces (perhaps showing confidence levels or allowing users to confirm/reject AI-suggested themes). Ethical considerations also arise: when inferring people’s implicit values, we must respect privacy and avoid misrepresentation. Techniques from explainable AI will be important so that the end-users of such a tool can trace *why* a certain theme was identified. \n\nNonetheless, the potential rewards are high. Imagine knowledge bases and ontologies that don’t just catalog **knowledge** but also encode **wisdom** – the purposes and values behind that knowledge. This could enable more empathetic AI systems that understand human context, improve decision-support systems by highlighting *why* one option might be favored over another, and enhance collaboration by making implicit assumptions explicit. In short, by discovering “not just what knowledge exists, but *why* it exists and *what it values*,” we move closer to AI that truly aligns with human understanding. Such alignment is essential for building technology that augments rather than replaces human insight. As you build your extraction tool, you are at the cutting edge of this movement: your success will not only help green architects in Mosul share and preserve crucial insights, but also pave the way for a new paradigm of **purpose-aware knowledge discovery** in many fields.\n\n**Sources:** Recent studies on LLM-assisted qualitative analysis and ontology learning have informed this approach: Nelson (2020) on computational grounded theory【2†L32-L40】, Ashwin et al. (2023) on LLM bias in coding【7†L55-L63】, Chew et al. (2023) on LLMs achieving human-level coding accuracy【11†L27-L34】, De Paoli (2024) on open-ended LLM-based thematic coding【9†L58-L66】, and Dai et al.

These sources collectively highlight both the need and the nascent means for the kind of purpose-centric knowledge extraction you are undertaking. The journey is just beginning, but the path is clear and immensely exciting.",

For your prototype analyzing 66 expert interviews from Iraq, I’ve identified practical tools and methodologies that can extract structured RDF insights for curriculum development and case studies.\n\n### Recent LLM capabilities transform qualitative analysis\n\nThe most significant advance is the **LLM-in-the-Loop Framework** (Dai et al., 2023), which reduces manual coding time from 23 hours to approximately 2 hours while maintaining human-level accuracy.  This framework demonstrates that **GPT-4 substantially outperforms GPT-3.5** for qualitative analysis, achieving Cohen’s κ above 0.6 on most coding tasks when using chain-of-thought prompting.  The AI-conducted interview platform from LSE (Geiecke & Jaravel, 2024) shows that LLMs can even conduct interviews at scale, generating responses 142% longer than traditional open-text fields. \n\nFor your Iraq interviews, the **LLMCode toolkit** (https://github.com/PerttuHamalainen/LLMCode) provides an immediately applicable framework with built-in validation mechanisms, hallucination detection, and support for privacy-compliant deployment. Studies consistently show 90%+ time reduction in analysis while enabling processing of datasets 10-100x larger than traditional manual analysis allows. \n\n### Practical pipelines convert interviews to RDF at scale\n\nFor converting your 66 interviews to RDF, I recommend a **hybrid approach** combining established linguistic tools with modern LLM capabilities:\n\n**FRED (Machine Reading for the Semantic Web)** serves as the foundation, supporting 48 languages including Arabic, with a REST API that extracts entities, relations, and events while linking to DBpedia and schema.org.   For a modern alternative, the **Neo4j LLM Knowledge Graph Builder** integrates OpenAI, Claude, and open-source models to create both lexical graphs with embeddings and entity graphs with configurable extraction schemas. \n\nCost analysis shows this is highly economical: using GPT-4o-mini, the entire 66-interview dataset would cost approximately **$30-65** to process.  The recommended implementation pipeline involves: (1) standardizing interview formats, (2) processing through FRED for initial extraction, (3) using LLMs for domain-specific refinement, and (4) applying SHACL validation for quality assurance. \n\n### Hierarchical processing preserves semantic relationships\n\n**DocETL** (https://github.com/ucbepic/docetl) emerges as the state-of-the-art framework for multi-scale document analysis. Its three core operators—split, gather, and resolve—enable hierarchical processing from project to sentence level while maintaining context. The system automatically optimizes processing through agent-based methods, costing only $0.86 to optimize and $0.29 to run on full datasets. \n\nFor your interviews, implement **200-512 token chunks with 50-token overlaps**, using DocETL’s gather operator to maintain interview context and metadata.  The resolve operator proves particularly valuable, reducing themes by 55% in tests by canonicalizing similar concepts across documents—critical for identifying consistent patterns across your 66 interviews.\n\n### Embedding analysis reveals blind spots in qualitative data\n\nModern embedding-based techniques can identify content that doesn’t fit expected categories, crucial for discovering overlooked perspectives in your Iraq interviews. **BERTopic** automatically identifies outlier clusters (Topic -1) containing documents that don’t fit main themes,   while tools like **Cleanlab’s OutOfDistribution** class use K-nearest neighbors to flag semantically distant content. \n\nFor visualization, **Embedding Atlas** provides scalable, interactive exploration of semantic spaces,  helping identify sparse regions that may represent underrepresented viewpoints. Given the Iraq context, this could reveal regional perspectives, generational differences, or sectarian nuances not captured in initial coding. I recommend using multilingual models like paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 to handle Arabic/English content appropriately.  \n\n### Established ontologies provide extensible foundations\n\nRather than creating ontologies from scratch, leverage **QualiCO (Qualitative Coding Ontology)** specifically designed for qualitative research schemas. Combine this with **FOAF** for expert descriptions and **SIOC** for content relationships.  For curriculum aspects, **CCSO (Curriculum Course Syllabus Ontology)** offers 41 concepts with 54 object properties specifically designed for educational contexts.\n\nThe integration strategy layers these vocabularies: RDF/RDFS + Dublin Core for basic metadata, FOAF + SIOC for people and interactions, QualiCO for interview coding, and CCSO for curriculum development.   For Iraq-specific content, add GeoNames for places and CIDOC-CRM extensions for cultural context.\n\n### Modular frameworks enable domain-agnostic analysis\n\n**Haystack 2.0** excels for document processing pipelines with superior documentation and RAG optimization, while **LangChain** provides comprehensive enterprise integration for complex agent-based systems.  For your use case, I recommend Haystack for the core pipeline with LangChain for LLM orchestration.\n\nImplement **speaker-turn based chunking** to preserve conversational structure, maintaining complete turns within 1500-2000 character chunks.   Use structured prompt templates with domain-specific terminology glossaries  and implement **three-tier validation**: automated format checks, LLM-based consistency validation, and human-in-the-loop review for uncertain extractions. \n\n### Implementation roadmap balances automation with accuracy\n\nFor your 66 interviews, begin with a pilot of 5-10 documents to refine prompts and validate the pipeline. Set **confidence thresholds at 85%**, routing lower-confidence extractions to human review. Implement domain expert validation for 10% of extractions to ensure accuracy,  particularly for culturally-specific content. \n\nThe complete pipeline leverages DocETL for hierarchical processing, FRED or Neo4j for RDF generation, BERTopic for gap analysis,   and Haystack for orchestration.  With proper implementation, you can expect to process all 66 interviews in under 10 hours of compute time at a cost below $100, while maintaining research-grade accuracy through systematic validation.\n\nThis approach transforms months of manual analysis into days of supervised automation,  enabling you to focus on interpreting insights rather than extracting them,  while the structured RDF output enables powerful semantic querying and visualization for curriculum development and case study creation.",

      "content": "### 1 | Where the Two Approaches **Converge**\n\n| Area | Your colleague’s study (“Advancing LLM-based …”) | Our purposive-structure review |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Human-LLM collaboration** | Adopts *LLM-in-the-Loop* workflow (Dai et al., 2023) to shrink coding time and reach κ > 0.6. citeturn0search0 | Identical starting point: use LLMs for open coding, then human refinement to ensure rigour. |\n| **Scalability focus** | Shows 90 %+ time savings on 66 interviews; costed <$100 with GPT-4o-mini. | Agrees that LLMs enable order-of-magnitude scale-ups; cites similar empirical gains across studies. |\n| **Pipeline modularity** | Combines DocETL “split → gather → resolve” with Neo4j or FRED for RDF export. citeturn0search2turn0search3turn0search4 | Endorses multi-operator pipelines (LLM map / reduce / resolve) and graph back-ends; stresses need for provenance links. |\n| **Ontology reuse** | Layers QualiCO + FOAF + SIOC + CCSO. citeturn0search5 | Encourages reuse of existing ontologies but argues for **new “teleology” and “axiology” classes** to capture purpose & value. |\n\n**Bottom line:** both frameworks embrace LLM-accelerated coding, hierarchical chunking, agentic orchestration (DocETL / Haystack), and RDF knowledge-graph outputs.\n\n---\n\n### 2 | What Our Review **Adds or Strengthens**\n\n| Gap in colleague’s plan | Added by purposive-structure agenda |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Purpose & value mining**: Pipeline centres on entity/event extraction (FRED) and QualiCO codes; implicit motives remain implicit. | Introduces **teleological & axiological extraction layers** (e.g., “fear of being first mover”, “value of heritage”). Suggests prompting LLMs for *why*-oriented codes and clustering them with sentence-embeddings + resolve. |\n| **Emergent category discovery**: Relies on pre-set schemas (QualiCO, CCSO). | Advocates **category-free open coding first**, then convergent clustering to let goals/values surface before mapping to any ontology. |\n| **Bias diagnostics**: Mentions hallucination detection, but not systematic bias checks. | Cites Ashwin et al. 2023 on demographic bias in GPT-4 coding and proposes dual validation (human sample + model agreement) and citation-forced prompts. citeturn0search0 |\n| **Representational richness**: Final output is entity-centric RDF. | Recommends a **purpose-aware graph**: nodes typed as *Goal, Value, Challenge* with quoted evidence edges – enabling causal queries (“which values motivate solar adoption?”). |\n| **Generalisation research**: Focuses on Iraqi green-building corpus. | Frames research program to test domain-invariant “purpose archetypes” across multiple fields (education, journalism, etc.). |\n\n---\n\n### 3 | Constructive **Critique** of Their Study\n\n1. **Over-reliance on FRED/DBpedia**  \n   *FRED* is excellent for factual triples, but its event model is English-centric and struggles with Iraqi Arabic dialect nuances; you may lose culturally-specific metaphors or value-laden idioms. citeturn0search3  \n\n2. **Schema-first, Purpose-second**  \n   Mapping straight into QualiCO/CCSO risks forcing interviews into preset buckets before latent teleology emerges. That could hide novel barriers (e.g., “post-conflict trust deficit”) that don’t map cleanly to existing classes.\n\n3. **Validation narrowly defined as SHACL checks**  \n   SHACL ensures syntactic RDF quality, not semantic truth. Add *member-checking* or *predictive* validation: can extracted “fear-of-first” actually predict who refuses pilot programmes?\n\n4. **Blind-spot detection limited to outlier embeddings**  \n   BERTopic Topic –1 flags linguistic anomalies, but purposive blind spots often hide in *common* language used for unexpected motives. Purpose mining + contrastive prompting can reveal “taken-for-granted” goals even in dense clusters.\n\n---\n\n### 4 | Recommended **Integration Road-Map**\n\n| Stage | Keep | Augment |\n|-------|------|---------|\n| **Pre-processing** | DocETL chunking 200-512 tokens with 50-token overlap (good). | Add **speaker-intention tags** (prompt LLM: “summarise the *reason* speaker gives in this turn”). Store alongside text before FRED. |\n| **Coding loop** | Continue LLM-in-the-Loop with LLMCode; use κ to accept codes. | Insert **purpose/value prompts**: *“List any implicit goals or values; quote text that signals each.”* Cluster with embeddings; resolve via LLM-guided canonicaliser. |\n| **Graph construction** | Keep Neo4j LLM Graph Builder for entity & relation ingest. | Extend schema:  `:Goal`, `:Value`, `:Barrier`, `PURPOSE_OF`, `MOTIVATED_BY`, all with `evidence` property (source sentence id). |\n| **Quality assurance** | SHACL + hallucination/od detection. | Add bias audit: sample 10 % of coded excerpts; double-code by humans; compare disagreement on sensitive demographics. |\n| **Reuse / sharing** | QualiCO + CCSO for curriculum alignment. | Publish *purpose-aware ontology module* (PROTELAX) so others can plug teleology/axiology into their RDF stacks. |\n\n---\n\n### 5 | Final Take-aways\n\n*Your colleague’s pipeline is a **state-of-practice** blueprint for high-volume qualitative RDF extraction.  \n*Our purposive-structure agenda turns that pipeline into **state-of-the-art** by:\n\n1. **Surfacing implicit motives and values** before ontology mapping.  \n2. **Retaining emergent categories** through open-coding & clustering.  \n3. **Embedding bias-aware validation** beyond syntax checks.  \n4. **Representing purpose/value nodes** for richer graph analytics and curricular storytelling.\n\nAdopting these augmentations will let your Mosul interviews reveal not just *what* experts said, but *why* they hold those positions – the key to designing culturally-attuned, value-aligned green-building curricula.",
