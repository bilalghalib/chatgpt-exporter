I believe taking halal rizq(sustinance) seriously can be a source of our healing, and can bring balance to our world.\n\nThe phone in your pocket connects you with cobalt miners in Kolwezi, Congo, designers in San Francisco, USA, and oil refineries in Iraq. The money you spend on that phone is your vote for the hundreds of processes it takes to make, market, ship, and sell it to you. Are you ready to accept responsibility for your actions? Are you ready to face the miners in Congo? Are you willing to defend your vote before God (SWT)?\n\nAre we except from being considered accomplices to oppression that happens in the value chains of our products simply because we are unaware? \n\nIgnorance is an excuse until you know better, and in the light of the global wars, Occupy Wall Street, and the consequences of climate collapse, more people are waking up to the idea that many elements of our polycrisis are by products of the systems we use to get and spend our sustenance. There are movements, like the boycott, divest, and sanction (BDS) movement that have shown how we can follow our ethics in choosing what not to buy. This book will examine what to buy instead. \n\n“...I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves.”\n-Surah Ibrahim Ayah 22\n\nMuslims represent nearly a quarter of the population of the planet and we can show leadership by developing products and services that follow the beautiful advice of the Prophet of God (S) who has said in an authentic (sahih) hadith: \n\n“Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” \n- Sunan an-Nasa’i 5711; In-book reference : Book 51, Hadith 173\n\nIn an era of destabilizing change and disquiet, we all want our prayers to be answered, and the Prophet (S) has given us a clue as to the relationship between halal rizk and answered prayers:\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: O people, Allah is Good and He therefore, accepts only that which is good. …  He then made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair disheveled and covered with dust(a person desperately needy). He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication): \"O Lord, O Lord,\" whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful and his nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?\nSahih Muslim 1015\n\nIt has been said that true wealth is contentedness, a path towards contentedness in this life, and confidence on the day we will be held accountable to how we earned and spent our money is increasing our efforts to gain knowledge in what is كَسْبٍ طَيِّبٍ (pure earning) and how best to spend it..\n\nBy reading this book, the reader will:\nTake stock of their transactions and work to purify their regular expenditures\nLearn how to earn a halal livelihood and make business a part of our worship.\nBe inspired to establish Baraka-based businesses that can support a parallel economy, one where muslims can confidently acquire pure goods and services.\nBe a part of showing leadership to a world questioning capitalism without alternatives.\n\nAbout the Author\nBilal Ghalib is an educator, entrepreneur and facilitator with 15 years of experience training entrepreneurs internationally. \nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom.pm, a social impact entrepreneurship training organization and education technology company. He’s an advisor for Project Defy, a non-profit organization working to redefine education in India. And since 2015 he has been running the Nur Coop, a business that seeks to be a blessing to the entire value chain from dirt to delivery. \n\nI have X intentions for writing this book:\nTo open the blessings of God to our beloved Muslim Community by sharing knowledge on halal rizk(sustenance).\n To support more people to spend their money in ways that are regenerative and uplifting of the people and ecological systems that underlie their purchases.\nTo transform my own eyes, and others, and to see what happens to businesses which see their customers, the natural world, and their business with the eye of the heart. \nTo increase my taqwa of God(SWT) when he mentions in the Quran “O you who believe! Eat of the lawful and pure things that We have provided you.” [2:172]” that it is God(SWT) providing my sustenance. And I must seek the lawful and pure and increase my efforts in ensuring my consumption is within the good pleasure of God.\nTo inspire people by demonstrating that the Muslim economy can bring about a beautiful transformation. \nTo alter my perception of success and increase my contentedness.  \nTo share my intuition that Muslims can be a blessing for this world by their deeper concern on the next.\nTo invite Muslims, and myself, to decommodify the world and to return to a pre-modern way of seeing the signs of God in all things and all people. And to witness the accompanying change in my interactions, including commercial interactions, with all things. \n\n  The Market \nThe book has three target audiences:\nPrimary target: \nEarly stage Muslim Entrepreneurs in the UK and the USA\nWhy is this book unique to them? Young Muslims are seeking security in an age of instability. The modern wisdom suggests they start multiple streams of income, be their own boss, and “ditch the 9-5” even if they could find one. The book attempts to direct them away from repeating the methods of doing business that has led to the age of instability in the first place and to seek trust not in themselves and their own capabilities, to first put their relationship with God right, to purify their expenditures, and then to set an intention and execute on creating a taqwa-filled baraka based business that in aggregate can act as a lighthouse in an age of darkness. \nAffinity Groups:\n Cambridge Muslim College\n Karim Lahham\n Faithfully Sustainable\n4 Nations Unite\nGeoff Lawton and Greening The Desert Project\nPeople who like https://tuniqoasis.com/\n\nSecondary Target\n[Insert secondary audience]\nWhy is this book unique to them?

            "extracted_content": "The sun streamed through the window as I held my six-month-old baby, his tiny warm hand wrapped around my finger. In that moment, tears welled up—a complex mixture of joy, worry about his future with wars raging in Palestine, wonder, and love. The thought arose clearly: this one moment is enough for a life to be worth having lived. All the difficulty, the joy, the learning, the travel, the writing—this single moment of direct knowing contained everything. There is a feeling here that does not stem from interpretation or analysis; it simply is. The sense of love and joy when I’m with my baby, or the amazement when seeing dolphins in the ocean, isn’t interpreted. Somehow it’s clear, yet if people asked, I couldn’t defend it. In our modern world, this makes these ways of knowing lesser than the “more correct” answers about evolutionary adaptation or a curiosity that inspires us to learn and survive in a hostile world.\n\nWe face a crisis of knowledge where our most meaningful experiences are considered the least valid. Instead of embracing direct experience and trusting what we know in that moment, we overemphasize interpretations and explanations. Consider how this plays out in the history of human understanding. For centuries, astronomers observed the peculiar motion of planets in the night sky—sometimes appearing to move backward in their journey across the heavens. This “retrograde motion” demanded explanation. The transmitted knowledge that Earth was the center of the universe forced scholars to create increasingly complex mathematical models. They added circles within circles, epicycles upon epicycles, performing intellectual gymnastics to preserve their fundamental assumption. It wasn’t until we allowed ourselves to consider that perhaps we weren’t the center that a simpler, more elegant truth emerged. The planets’ apparent backward motion was the natural result of observing them from our own moving platform as we all orbit the sun.\n\nThis pattern repeats throughout history and within our own lives, including the question of how we experience time itself. Clock time is one where the ticking of a clock determines life, versus a more connected sense of natural rhythms. Consider waking up with the gradual warming light of the dawn, feeling the dew in the air, versus waiting anxiously for the digital clock to hit a certain hour. Clock time can feed into forethought, planning, projection, earning, extracting—getting the most “bang” from your buck, hoarding and expecting growth over time as interest accrues. In a different mode, guided by natural cycles, one might embrace harvest seasons, planting seasons, resting seasons, and acting seasons. This can lead to greater harmony with the environment and less frenetic extraction. Instead of waiting impatiently for the moment the clock strikes 5pm, you feel the workday’s natural conclusion as the sun sets, finishing a cycle that you belong to rather than exploit.\n\nHow can we possibly know what it feels like to live in a society that constructs entirely different mental architectures? Perhaps cultures that trust more in the unseen or have a foundational belief in the care of a most Merciful reality. I recall a story of a sheikh in a car accident where the driver was killed. The passenger rushes to check on the sheikh, blood running down his face, and the sheikh calmly says he is fine—he had set his intention and prayed before the journey, so whatever occurred was within that realm of care and meaning. What would it be like to inhabit a mind that can remain so calm and trusting in such urgent circumstances? Even imagining a small percentage of the population having that level of trust shifts our sense of what’s possible. This trust creates a new ground of being, connecting us beyond immediate fear and reminding us that, from a certain perspective, all gifts come from a source beyond our manipulation.\n\nIn my own life, I recall a moment in a refugee camp in Syria where I was given the most delicious meal I had in months. The culture of hospitality there was not a transaction—there was no ledger balancing out what was given and what would be returned. The non-intellectualized thought that “I have received, so I will give” created a lived reality of generosity. Gift economies can shift us from hoarding to relationship. Rather than relying on the integral measure of wealth (how much I have in my bank), we might consider the derivative (how much flows through, how we participate in a living dynamic of exchange). This sort of trust-based approach to economics aligns more closely with human presence and natural rhythms than with a strict, clock-driven and interest-based system that seeks accumulation and leverage.\n\nKnowing what is beautiful and Good fills the heart with a kind of song, but enacting it requires effort and friction. Suppose I want to visit a sick person: I must scrape the snow off my car, drive to the hospital, buy flowers, spend time. This friction is transformative. By choosing to enact beauty rather than remain in comfort, I sand down my self-absorption. Each time I choose someone’s well-being over my own convenience, I integrate a deeper sense of connection and moral presence. Doing this repeatedly can create a different sort of internal architecture—one where concern for others is not an abstraction but a lived reality. Over time, we become the kind of people who find it natural to give, to share, to participate in the cycle of reciprocity and care. If we consider the human body and mind as something that can be hollowed out by self-absorption or filled with vibrant life by consciously choosing what’s Good, then these acts of kindness, even if small, fill the emptiness with beauty.\n\nHistorical examples also show how cultures respond differently to technology and power. Japan, after mastering the gun, famously decided to give it up, not wanting to allow a weapon that requires no discipline or honing of virtue to become widespread. This question of who we empower with technology remains critical today. We mass-produce complex tools that can reshape entire societies, yet we do so without ensuring that those wielding such power have developed themselves ethically. We search for metrics of progress—GDP growth, technological advancement, profit margins—but in doing so we might lose sight of the person in need right in front of us, the soil that nourishes us, the fragile interconnections that sustain life, and the beauty that can be enacted in this very moment.\n\nWe are tempted to strategize and find the perfect metrics to measure success, but perhaps the most meaningful “metric” is the act of goodness itself. Like the child who throws one starfish back into the sea despite the countless others left behind, it matters to that one starfish, and it matters to that child. Each such act recreates a reality of mercy and compassion on Earth, a reality that cannot be fully captured by numbers. By focusing on our purification, on taking ourselves to account (muhasaba), on reviewing our intentions and actions (muraja3a), we can become more aware of what we are doing with our time, our capabilities, and our opportunities. Slowly, this leads us to align ourselves more with a sense of wholeness and ethical participation in the world’s unfolding story.\n\nFlow states, in the psychological sense, do not guarantee ethical action. One can be deeply engrossed in an activity that is harmful. But if we bring the same presence, trust, and openness into what we choose to do, then this immersion can be coupled with right intention, resulting in acts that not only feel seamlessly integrated but also contribute to something good and harmonious. At that point, we are not just living life as a series of transactions or ticking boxes off a to-do list governed by the clock and external demands. We are participating in the world as a dynamic, living tapestry, where each choice creates a new pattern and each moment carries the potential for kindness, generosity, and understanding.\n\nUltimately, the greatest gift is existence itself, which we have not earned. We arrive in a world we did not create, among people we did not choose, in environments shaped by countless converging forces of nature and history. Recognizing this can open us to awe and humility. Instead of looking for a perfect formula or metric, we can learn to be present enough to see what each moment asks of us: sometimes to give rather than hoard, sometimes to plant rather than reap, sometimes to rest rather than push forward, and sometimes to stand in wonder and gratitude at the simple fact that we are here at all.\n\nIn doing so, we create a kind of resonance, a lived architecture of trust and care that might slowly spread through our personal relationships, our communities, and perhaps beyond. We do not have to solve it all or explain it all. The mere act of experiencing and responding wholeheartedly to what is given—whether it’s the chance to help a sick person, share a meal in a refugee camp, marvel at dolphins in the ocean, or hold a baby’s hand in a sunlit room—is enough to show that another way of relating to knowledge, time, trust, and meaning is not only possible but already present, waiting quietly for our recognition."

            "extracted_content": "Hello. Thank you for coming to learn more about our ethics and practices at TŪNIQ. Only through radical transparency in everything from clothing to the meat industry to technology and beauty, can we begin to reverse some of the harms of industrialization, colonization, and capitalism.\nUnlike the fast majority of fashion brands in the world, who don't know where their raw materials came from or who made their clothes, TŪNIQ has created our own supply chain so that we are in full control of production from end-to-end, raw fiber to finished garment, sheep to shop.\n\nWe have three things which we believe are sacred and which we hope to protect and nourish through TŪNIQ:\nLabor\nPolicies:\n\nWorkers are entitled to work from their homes and on their own schedules. They own the means of production and freely choose to produce as much as they wish.\nWithin reason, we never negotiate with the asking price our artisans have named. Quite frequently, we offer more when we believe a quoted rate to be too low.\nWe distribute 50% of annual profits amongst all artisans in our cooperative, if they choose to accept it, so that they share in the fruits of their labor, the ownership of TŪNIQ, and are not alienated from their labor. We believe profit sharing is an important tool in combatting global wealth inequality and capitalist centralized power.\nWe do not share our workers information or photos & videos of their faces without permission.\nAt this stage, the entire founding team at TŪNIQ is working on a volunteer basis, and we have not paid ourselves one cent of revenue. We will not feel at peace paying ourselves until we have secured this cooperative and the livelihoods of our artisans.\nVision:\n\nLike many of you, we have thought a lot about colonization and the need for reparations. And we've wondered why, if the poor former colonies of the world are essentially the ones producing everything that the wealthy former colonizers of the world are buying, why isn’t that benefiting those countries? Why isn’t that bringing about the redistribution of wealth that it should be resulting in and that it has the potential to create? It has the potential to be the basis for the self-empowerment of the Global South. Instead, it seems to only be further impoverishing us.\n\nThe reason, we've learned, this isn’t benefiting them is because their labor is being exploited by Western corporations who take all of that generated wealth and the profit margin for themselves. In fast fashion for example, you have women in Bangladesh making 5 Zara shirts a day getting paid a few dollars a week while Zara charges $80 or more per shirt. This is happening in almost every manufacturing industry where products are mass produced outside the West and brought back to be sold at cheap prices.\n\nIt is just as Marx aptly said that the defining feature of the modern economy is that those who own the means of production get richer and richer while the worker \"becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and size. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. The devaluation of the world of men is in direct proportion to the increasing value of the world of things. Labor produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity.\" (Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844)\n\nFor all of these reasons, we believe it is our duty to ensure that the labor of our artisans humanizes and enriches them the more that they work, rather than commodifies and impoverishes them. \n\nIf you want to get to know the artisans we work with, please head to our Meet the Makers page where we have a feature on each artisan who has generously agreed to share their stories with you.\nHuman Dignity\nPolicies:\n\nWe conceal the faces of models in order to fight against the rampant commodification of the unique visages of real people, to focus your attention primarily on the product, and to avoid contributing to harmful beauty standards perpetuated by our online culture around face photography.\nWe believe sizing charts implicate serious ethical and moral issues. For too long, the fashion industry has taken a women's size 4 and simply scaled her body proportions up and down for all other sizes. We believe this contributes significantly harmful body standards and to exclusion of community members. This is why we chose instead to begin with a US women's size 10, to create designs and size proportions that are much looser-fitting and do not sexually objectify men or women, and to reflect proportions such as wider hips or thighs, that are too often left out of the industry or made to feel ugly. This was difficult work, and it is ongoing as we adapt all our sizes and as we adjust with your feedback, but it was important for us to undertake it.\nWe offer products that we firmly believe nourish and are of benefit to our customers lives, body and soul, rather than harm them.\nWe do not pay for intrusive advertisements of any kind, especially not on social media platforms. This is for many reasons. Such advertisements mine your personal data and violate your privacy to \"target\" ads towards certain demographics. We also believe the over-saturation of our lives with constant advertisements that we do not choose to see is harmful to our psyches and peace of mind. We also do not use language in our marketing which contributes to the harmful culture of consumption and soul-degradation perpetuated by modern capitalism (such as, \"must-haves\"}. We believe in creating a beautiful offering which is available to those who seek it (for example: online searches, marketplaces, and trade shows, etc.)\nWe offer fair and honest pricing, working hard to be accessible to all communities and all classes. We do not overly markup goods or seek to inflate prices to appeal to \"luxury\" markets, despite meeting that standard with our quality.\nWe do not steal unrecognized and uncompensated designs from other cultures, particularly if they are in the Global South and have had their culture colonized and exploited for centuries prior.\nThrough the direct to client model and other measures, we ensure that the vast majority of earned revenue and expenses remains within the hands of communities in the Global South to combat the growing global wealth and power gap.\nWe strive to educate our customers about the work that goes into making clothes across the garment industry, and the harms resulting from negligent and exploitative practices, so that they can make informed, ethical choices. We include information about the making of our products in numerous places on our website, including on many product pages and in our Meet the Makers section.\nWe seek to offer a soul-nourishing experience and connection on our website that goes beyond being a mere online store and seeks to create change in the world through our online platform for modern ethicists, The Oasis Journal.\n \n\nVision:\n\nTo be frank, we used to be somewhat ashamed at TŪNIQ that we started a business. The pursuit of profit seemed to us, a corrupt impulse, and we wished we could help these artisans without seeking to make money off our customers. But, further thought and experience has taught us that of course humans traded with one another and did business long before the modern era which has been so destructive. Such premodern forms and cultures of trade can inspire ours today. \n\nWe believe that trade should not be about the relentless pursuit of profit. This was not God's design in creating the blessing of human commerce. It should be about sharing and generating benefits for everyone. Every step of the way should bring benefit and blessing into the lives of everyone involved, not destruction. Our artisans support themselves and fulfill their love of their craft, our customers get to purchase beautiful unique products at fair prices and engage with a business that enriches their soul and humanity, and we get to work in accordance with our values and support ourselves as well as explore our ideas for generating a more just world through The Oasis Journal. \n\nWhere there was nothing, through loving labor, we can generate benefit for all. That's our economic philosophy. \n\n  \n\nGod's Earth\nPolicies:\n\nAll of our pieces are made from 100% organic, locally sourced and handmade materials without the use of any toxic dyes. We do this to protect the environment from harmful chemicals and to boycott the destructive cotton and wool industries, as well as the tremendous pollution caused by the synthetic fabric industry. Please note: this is with the exception of our chechia hats, which are currently produced by artisans who use 100% wool but do apply synthetic dyes. We are actively working with them to experiment and create alternatives, taking the risk for failed inventory on ourselves.\nOur packaging is plastic-free, hand-wrapped, and 100% backyard compostable.\nOur entire workflow is plastic-free, and we reject any single-use plastics in all aspects of our work, even beyond packaging.\nOur production process is as energy-efficient as possible, relying for nearly every task on human power, rather than electricity. \nOur Co-op from end to end is carbon negative, regenerating the soil with every textile. \nVision:\nIt is our belief at TŪNIQ that God created this beautiful world and that humans are mere stewards and custodians of it. In everything we do, we are guided by this underlying Truth and by our submission and surrender to the One. We must uphold the perfect God-given balance that exists within nature and must not transgress the boundaries of this by taking more than what can be given and depleting natural resources faster than they can be replenished.\nAs we have discovered through this work, God has blessed us on this earth with numerous miraculous resources at our disposal, sheep offer their wool every spring to be shorn before they overheat in the summer and so that can spin, weave, and clothe ourselves. Almost everything around us can be used to benefit and nourish our lives, by God's mercy, and we must hold on to the traditions that people have developed over millennia which show us how to work and transform these raw materials into beautiful works of art, while continuing to improve and adjust traditional techniques. \nWhen it comes to our fabric, our wool is raw, untreated with any synthetic dyes or treatments, local and hand-woven.Some of our oldest linings for wool coats were made with synthetic blends, which we will discontinue and replace with organically-dyed cotton once all stock is sold. We offer wool products that rely on natural colors produced by sheep, rather than injecting them with toxic dyes which are harmful to the soil and the health of workers. We continue to experiment with local plant and herb dyes.\n\nWe are also proud to say we have finally been able to cut plastic (including plastic tape and labels!) completely out of our packaging and are instead protecting your pieces with 100% recycled paper boxes, large paper flour bags, staples, and jute thread. \n\n \n\n \n\nPlease watch this video for a transparent look at our process of hand-producing every one of our pieces in harmony with the rhythm and lives of local communities"

            "extracted_content": "Here is the essay with reference to the Way or wu wei removed, while preserving as much of the original content and style as possible:\nThe sun streamed through the window as I held my six-month-old baby, his tiny warm hand wrapped around my finger. In that moment, tears welled up - a complex mixture of joy, worry about his future with wars raging in Palestine, wonder, and love. The thought arose clearly: this one moment is enough for a life to be worth having lived. All the difficulty, the joy, the learning, the travel, the writing - this single moment of direct knowing contained everything.\nClock time is one where the tick-tocking of a clock determines life, vs one where one might be more connected to natural rhythms and the implications it has on integrating one into a dynamic with the world. Seeing the sun setting, knowing the work day is done vs watching a clock slide to 5pm and jumping for joy. The entrainment we get into with clocks dictating our days is harsh and sharp vs the gradual feeling of waking up groggy at dawn and booting up over the course of an hour as the sun slowly stars warming the earth. The transitions, the presence, the connection with the solar system and universe as we smell the morning full of dew, or connecting with the inner cosmos, as some women do with their menstrual cycles. As we connect more to the cycles of life, harvest seasons, planting seasons, resting seasons, acting seasons, I believe we get into more harmony and less tick tock investment return i paid x for this and it's been 12 months and i expect a 5 percent annual return. VS planting, praying, abundance, sharing. I believe there is a relationship between time and presence and gifts and abundance and clock time and forethought/planning/projection and earning and extracting. \"Getting the most \"bang\" from your buck\" or earning more per hour/day - leverage, hoarding because hoarding and time leads to growth. VS alternative economics where hoarding leads to grain spoilage, the inversion of interest and making money on money, holding grain leads to reduction and encourages spending.\nThere are minds built differently than our modern consciousness allows us to imagine. I remember a story of a sheikh who was in a car accident where the driver was killed. The person in the backseat jumps out of the car and rushes to the window where the sheikh was sitting, blood dripping from his face, desperately asking if he's OK. The sheikh simply says \"I am ok, God be praised, I have set my intention and prayed my istikhara prayer, requesting permission and blessings for this car journey.\" The idea that someone can be in an urgent situation like this and remain calm because of a foundational belief that they are in the care of a most Merciful Lord makes me wonder what it would be like to inhabit a mind like that. What would the world be like if we had even 1% of the population with eyes that see the world like that? This sort of trust creates a new ground of being that connects us beyond time and presence to the ultimate, and in that grounding, we can pour forth in this world all our gifts without fear of loss.\nThe time sausage is a metaphor, like the many snapshots of a cartoon drawn on paper, except in 3d, to help us imagine our lives in the grand scheme of the universe. The time sausage has a thin pointy bit at one end and then expands, showcasing the big bang creating space/time and each slide of this time sausage is a moment from the very beginning till now. Your life would start as a minuscule few cells, moving around in a tiny sphere stretched through time towards a period where all your composite molecules will once again be scattered in an earth-shaped orb. In this view watching outside time and space one can imagine that each snapshot also must have within it consciousness and experience. Presence to me feels like it can be expanded about 3/4 seconds of existence. Perhaps as Shakespeare says, there's nothing good or bad and that thinking makes it so - we can imagine that the duration of a ruminative thought of self dislike can be the sense / being / snapshot for your consciousness in that frame in the time sausage forever. There's no going back. Otherwise the sense of self acceptance / like, trust in yourself being as beautiful as you can be, given the singular nature of the time sausage and all the other elements within it - that's a good place to live \"forever\" in a sense.\nMaking a plan and sticking to it is one of the critical success factors no matter the initial feedback we might have. One of the worst ways to lose money is jumping into the stock market greedily seeing the price go up and then when the correction inevitably comes selling in terror as everything tumbles - only to watch as the stock market performs stable and smoothly in a multi-year perspective. Patience and planning, vs responding with greed and fear can be seen easily in markets as they are a sort of mirror to the feeling of the market.\nThe book \"The Gift\" by Lewis Hyde documents gift cultures, the idea that art can be a gift and maybe is a gift of connection.\nHistorians debate for ages why Zheng He had ships with 28,000 sailors and visited 30 countries yet didn't colonize a single one, similarly there's The Needham Puzzle which asks why didn't China develop science and industrialize when it had the means to. Other historians question why the Ottoman empire didn't industrialize, seeming to take as a given that western society's developmental direction is progress and that they \"should\" have. The outcomes might not have been politically advantageous as these countries were dominated by Europeans militarily. There are some interesting stories of people from the Ottoman empire being asked about European wealth, big buildings, wide streets, yet seeming not to be excited by this view of glamorous progress. A society can be judged by how it treats its weak, or perhaps, we can judge a society by how much anti-depressants they prescribe.\nTransmitted knowledge can be seen as things we learn from others, including science, and transmitted elements from religious doctrines. Derived knowledge takes a mind and a world and contemplation. The book Hayy Ibn Yaqzan follows the story of someone on a deserted island who in their primordial knowledge seeking and enaction essentially ends up practicing the Muslim faith, an ancient story.\nThe trust that people have create a new ground on which to stand, especially without fear of hunger or death it creates a different way to interact. Today we want smart contracts that are incorruptible, what if our souls were, what if there were people in the world where dishonor and going against their word/trust would be worse than death? It seems to create a platform from which we can connect/exchange that is beautiful rather than mechanical and efficient. I believe a perfect system where our souls are not exposed to the reality of ethical action, and the friction that choosing the Good provides, is in fact the opposite of a perfect system. It's preventing the most beautiful parts of us from growing, causing atrophy in the muscles of perception and enaction of The Good - leading to smooth and slippery exchange of \"Goods and services\" except are they goods if the bodies they provide nutrition to are empty of beauty? Are they really serving us if the will that directs those services has not been refined through repeated interaction with ethical training and action?\nThink of the state of Flow from Csikszentmihalyi - the capacity at wondering if you're there is occupied with engagement. CopyRetryBGcontinue the essayEditCreating Ethical Friction\nKnowing what is beautiful and Good is one thing - it fills the heart with song. I want to give time to visit a sick person, then there's the effort of going and clearing the snow off the car and driving to the hospital, buying flowers, and spending time with the person. That process is effortful; there's friction there. You choose to become the goodness that you imagined.\nIn the light of oneness, this friction sands down the self-absorbed, individuated part of you that would rather want for itself - coffee from that fancy shop rather than flowers for that person, sleep in your warm bed rather than scraping snow off the car. The self-absorbed self is shrunk every time we prioritize beauty and goodness. The process of doing this enacts beauty and goodness and makes it a reality in the world.\nI was once in a refugee camp in Syria where I was given the most delicious meal I had in months. The desire to be generous to guests, the hospitality culture, reveals something fundamental about trust and gift-giving. The (non-intellectuated) thought that \"I have received so I will give\" creates a different kind of social reality. It's critical that the gift doesn't become a transaction - this is related to the disindividuating practices.\nTechnology and Worthiness\nConsider Japan's decision, documented in the book \"Giving up the Gun,\" where after becoming world experts, they chose to stop making guns and muskets. They saw the disgrace in how someone with no training, no honing of the self, could shoot and kill a samurai with decades of discipline and a protective warrior ethic. Who do we empower with our technologies if our selves are not refined? Do we want to give the power of the Gods to those who don't discipline themselves to earn it?\nWhen college dropouts can build technologies that transform the world before they have learned how to mourn the loss of their parents, or raise a toddler with patience and love, we must question our direction. The metrics might be the problem - coming up with a measure takes away from the quality of creating the situation of beauty. For instance, if we measure number of impoverished people, we are measuring a number instead of knowing the person.\nThe Starfish and the Boy\nThere's a story of a child on a beach throwing starfish back into the water one at a time. There are hundreds of starfish. The father asks, \"You know it doesn't matter, you can't save them all,\" and the boy responds, \"It matters to this one\" as he throws it into the ocean. The idea is that it doesn't just matter to the starfish, it matters to the boy. The boy has created the reality of mercy on earth where indifference is the \"rational\" response.\nThe shift in thinking is to focus on our purification and action and creating situations for this rather than thinking about systems and metrics only to intervene strategically. The most strategic thing to do is to make real Goodness and beauty. This makes it... real.\nThe Gift of Existence\nThe ultimate gift is the gift of existence which we didn't do anything for and from which all other gifts derive. To see the world as a constant paying it forward of the ultimate gift, transferring, shifting, never being consumed or reduced is a way to begin to trust. Perhaps I go hungry, yet the beauty of a world which exists generously with gifts and offerings and sharing and loving others as oneself - perhaps because the unitary consciousness sees this as true.\nSuccess should be in every step for a king, president and shop owner. Success is in right action at the right time derived from right seeing. These, in aggregate, create a more beautiful world, although it doesn't matter. What matters is that we become beautiful in trying, that we make real the possibility of beauty and trust in a world increasingly structured around fear and extraction. The path is not one to follow but a reality to create, moment by moment, choice by choice, in the eternal now where all possibility resides. CopyRetryBGContinueEditReconciling Science and Spirituality\nThe idea of a scientist curiously and openly attempting to see and understand brings awe, wonder, curiosity. But science directed by intentionality seeking to make use of the operations of the natural world for the benefit of the inventor is different, blinded, and I believe directs science toward a world of less awe and more mechanization and harm.\nConsider the Fritz Haber process, which transforms nitrogen from the air into fertilizer. It was first invented to build bombs for the German war machine. Today, that abundance of nitrogen has led to feeding millions of people - yet the food is not as nutritious, and how many diseases of malnutrition do we have? What about the dead land and the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico from nitrogen-based fertilizer runoff? Contrast this with the discovery of penicillin - an accident, a gift, acknowledged as such by Pasteur through his rejection of patent rights. This demonstrates how openness and acceptance of knowledge through wonder and curiosity can influence those who receive it. It's all a gift, why not give and share of its benefit?\nReviewing and Aligning\nBringing our innovation and creativity in line with our sense of oneness with all things requires constant review. In the Muslim tradition, this is called muraja3a (reviewing) and muhasaba (taking ourselves to account). A day that starts with intention and ends with reviewing allows us to constantly stay in tune. Like a tuning fork near another one, we can listen for the resonances and move. The 99 names, and infinitely many more, are in a dynamic dance everywhere within and without us. Our role can be to align to that, and then slowly, slowly watch our movements come into harmony with that which is the origin of harmony.\nWhen we participate in discovery and innovation, we can always review: is this encouraging harmony and balance? Is it beautiful? The natural direct knowledge we see and know about the harmony and balance of the world is not foreign to us. As we learn and understand more about how it works, we can also learn how best to participate.\nConclusion: Towards a New Architecture of Mind\nWe stand at a critical juncture in human history, where our technological and scientific capabilities have far outpaced our ethical and spiritual development. We have the power to transform the planet, yet we struggle to transform ourselves. The path forward lies not in abandoning rationality or science, but in integrating them with a deeper wisdom, a trust in the fundamental goodness and beauty of existence.\nThis requires a new architecture of mind, one that balances the analytical with the intuitive, the quantitative with the qualitative, the individual with the collective. It requires cultivating a direct knowing, a way of being in harmony with natural cycles and rhythms, a trust in the abundance of the universe. It means creating friction where it matters - in the daily choice to prioritize beauty and goodness over self-interest and comfort.\nThis is not an easy path. It demands constant reflection, review, and realignment. It requires the courage to question our metrics of success, to value the immeasurable, to prioritize the development of the soul alongside the development of technology. But it is a necessary path if we are to create a future worth inhabiting, a world of beauty, balance, and harmony.\nIn every moment, we have the opportunity to participate in this creation, to align our actions with our highest intentions, to let go of fear and trust in the fundamental benevolence of the universe. This is the way of beauty and trust, the path of heart in a heartless world. It begins with a single step, a single choice, a single moment of presence. And it begins now."
