Review nanny contract and freelance contract - These require attention to detail and a quiet environment.\n2. Prepare nanny bag and passport bag - These are preparatory tasks that can be done in a peaceful setting.\n3. Apply to nurse jobs - This task is likely to be done online and quietly.\n\nThese tasks are conducive to a quiet environment and can be started and stopped easily if the baby wakes up earlier than expected.",
