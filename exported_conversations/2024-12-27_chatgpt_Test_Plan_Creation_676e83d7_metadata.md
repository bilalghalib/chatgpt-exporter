## 🧠 Theory of Mind Insights

**Beliefs**:
- AI can dramatically accelerate development through copy-paste code
- People value meaning but have limited time (hence 8-minute focus)
- Handcrafted personal touches (poems, art) have monetary value
- Simplicity beats feature richness

**Mental Models**:
- **Build-Measure-Learn**: Focus on prototyping and testing before full build
- **AI as Pair Programmer**: Works with multiple AI agents simultaneously, treats them as collaborators with different roles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: 8-minute entry point, then optional deeper features
- **Manual First, Automate Later**: Start with human processes, add automation only when needed

**Decision-Making**:
- **Optimize for speed of learning** (high frequency)
- **Seek external validation** before proceeding (medium frequency)
- **Simplify when stuck** (high frequency)
- **Persist through obstacles** (high frequency - continues through 15+ errors)

**Communication Style**: Casual, concise, emotionally expressive, very direct. Uses fragments, shares errors without commentary, asks compound questions.
