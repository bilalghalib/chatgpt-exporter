      "content": "I have an idea to make a way to do a sort of new investment vehicle for the Bloom teams and need some help thinking it through\n\nThe idea is that teams contribute a portion of reveneues monthly and equal revenue portions get equal contributions (they're considered members in th esame way) - then people get to get a regular dividend from the pool monthly as well, then the idea is that investors put in money into the pool too and get dividends as well,not sure how to calculate how much or what percentage, dot hey become a part of the \"cooperative\"?\n\nMy goals to design this thing is to do a few things:\n\n1) derisk entrepreneurship and stabilize revenue for teams that have variable revenues that makes it hard to go through lean times to get to fat times \n\n2) to derisk investment in social enterprises by spreading it across many businesses and change the investment basket (not high risk)\n\n3) to make it possible to invest in social enterprises that work on physical/local projects that dont' have huge scaling laws behind them, good growth, make money\n\n4) to help build institutitions by building pweor and strength within organizations by creating a community that are each others champions so the idea of ubuntu is real and tangible \n\n4.b) by having investors invest in 1-5-10 year commitments they get a clear return they can bank on without investing with the expectation of an exit - not exit oriented investments help businesses imaginge becoming long term owners and institution builders, not R&D for international organizations\n\n5. To include Bloom in the cohort as a trainer - an equal part contributor (also sharing our revenue) to help include our success with our team success\n\ncan you help me study my model and tell me 5 pros and 5 cons and 5 similar investment vehicles so i know if i'm reinventing the wheel?

      "content": "Love this, Bilal. You’re basically describing a pooled, revenue-sharing cooperative with long-horizon capital layered in—aimed at smoothing income for member ventures and giving investors a steady, non-exit-dependent return. Here’s a quick, no-nonsense read on it.\n\n# 5 clear pros\n1) **Income smoothing for founders.** A shared pool funded by a % of monthly revenues can stabilize cashflow through lean/fat cycles—closer to an income-stabilization “mutual” than classic VC.  \n2) **Diversified risk for investors.** One ticket spreads across many real-economy businesses; returns ride overall basket performance rather than single-bet outcomes.  \n3) **Non-exit returns.** Monthly dividends (with a reserve policy) let investors earn without forcing exits—aligned with steward-ownership/evergreen logic. citeturn3search0turn3search12  \n4) **Institution-building + Ubuntu.** Members co-fund each other’s resilience; governance can be multi-stakeholder so teams, investors, and Bloom all have a seat (one-member-one-vote if you go cooperative). citeturn4search0turn4search16  \n5) **“Patronage-based” fairness.** If distributions use **patronage** (business done with the co-op) rather than paid-in capital, smaller but active members aren’t drowned out by whales. That’s how co-ops pay **patronage dividends** in many jurisdictions. citeturn0search11turn0search16\n\n# 5 real cons / design risks\n1) **Correlation risk.** In downturns, *everyone’s* revenue dips and the pool shrinks exactly when needed. You’ll want a hard reserve target (e.g., 3–6 months of baseline payouts) and gates on redemptions.  \n2) **Adverse selection + gaming.** Teams with volatile revenues have strongest incentive to join; under-reporting revenue or timing invoices can game contributions. You’ll need audit rights, standardized reporting, and maybe a minimum “dues floor.”  \n3) **Liquidity mismatch.** Promising monthly dividends while inflows fluctuate can backfire. Establish a **waterfall**: (i) admin, (ii) refill reserves to target, (iii) member floor, (iv) investor coupon, (v) surplus split.  \n4) **Governance complexity.** Mixing founders, outside investors, and Bloom requires clear classes (producer members, investor members, service/training member) and decision rights so it doesn’t gridlock. citeturn4search0  \n5) **Regulatory/tax.** Depending on jurisdiction, pooled revenue sharing + paying dividends to investors can look like a security or a co-op patronage refund; treatment differs (e.g., Subchapter-T in the U.S.; Community Shares/CBS in the UK). You’ll need local counsel for Lebanon/France/where members reside. citeturn0search16turn2search2turn2search4\n\n# 5 closest existing models (so you’re not reinventing wheels)\n\n1) **Revenue-Based Financing (RBF).** Investors get a % of revenue until a cap/multiple is hit (non-dilutive, payments flex with revenue). Your idea extends RBF across *many* companies via one pool. citeturn0search0turn0search10turn0search15  \n2) **Redeemable / “Alternative Exit” Equity.** Equity that founders buy back over time via dividends tied to revenue/free cash flow—no IPO needed. Useful precedent for your investor return terms. citeturn0search9turn0search14  \n3) **Co-op Patronage Dividends.** Co-ops distribute surplus to *patrons* by usage (e.g., value of trade), not by capital.

RBF/“redeemable equity” precedents help here. citeturn0search4\n\n# Quick sanity rules of thumb\n- **α% too high** → starves growth; too low → pool is useless. Start small (3–5%) and revisit annually.  \n- **Reserve first** → no reserve, no promises. Aim 3–6 months baseline payouts.  \n- **Patronage basis** beats equity basis for member dividends—aligns with “help the helpers.” citeturn0search11  \n- **Keep investor power narrow.** Governance by purpose (mission lock) + one-member-one-vote for core decisions. citeturn2search2\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a 1-pager with (a) a diagram of the cash waterfall, (b) a sample month showing contributions/payouts, and (c) a checklist for legal wrappers in your likely jurisdictions.",

      "content": "Great Qs — and yes, it all makes sense. I’ve done two things for you:\n\n1) **Simulator tweaked:** the explorable now defaults to **$5k–$10k/month** per team and has a **“Halal mode (no interest)”** toggle. In Halal mode, there’s **no fixed coupon**; investors get only a share of surplus (profit) until a cap—no guarantees.\n\n2) **One-pager, plain language + diagram:** added on the canvas (“Bloom Pool — One-Pager”). It explains every term in human words and shows a simple waterfall diagram.\n\nQuick answers here, too:\n\n- **Coupon (fixed coupon):** a bond-style, fixed periodic payment (e.g., 6%/yr). In our model it’s **optional**. Turn Halal mode on to remove it entirely and use **profit-share only**.\n\n- **Floating coupon:** a coupon that varies (e.g., with revenue or an index). We don’t need it—Halal mode uses **no coupon at all**.\n\n- **Patronage basis vs equity basis:**  \n  - *Patronage*: distribute member surplus by **how much each team used/contributed** (their revenue × α%).  \n  - *Equity*: distribute by **how much capital someone put in**.  \n  Patronage is fairer for Ubuntu/solidarity because it rewards participation, not wealth.\n\n- **Mission lock:** bylaws/legal guardrails that protect purpose (no sale, capped investor rights, surplus rules). Keeps finance servant to mission.\n\n- **One member, one vote:** cooperative governance—core decisions are democratic regardless of balance sheet size.\n\n- **Reserve target & top-up:** the pool keeps a buffer (e.g., **4 months** of member floor). Each month **new cash first refills** the reserve **to target** before anyone gets paid.\n\n- **Dividend (member distribution):** what’s left **after** admin + **reserve top-up** + **member floor**. In Halal mode, investors also only share in this **surplus** (profit).\n\n- **“Investment should help growth”** — exactly. As teams grow revenue, **α% contributions rise**, reserves fill faster, and **surplus grows**, which boosts member distributions and investor profit-shares—without exits.\n\n- **CITs & cousins:**  \n  - **CITs (Community Investment Trusts):** locals invest small sums in neighborhood assets; receive dividends tied to actual performance.  \n  - Other cousins: **co-op patronage dividends, community shares (withdrawable, capped return), revenue-based financing (RBF), mutual-credit networks (Sardex).**\n\n- **Halal / Ghazali-friendly framing:** use **profit-share (Mudarabah-like)**: investors fund; teams work. **No guaranteed return**, no riba—investors receive a **% of realized surplus** until a **cap** (e.g., 1.3×). Mission-lock + one-member-one-vote preserve justice.\n\nIf you want, I can add two presets to the simulator:\n- “**Halal 80/20**”: α=5%, floor=$800, reserve=4 months, **surplus split 80% members / 20% investors**, cap=1.3×, **coupon=0**.  \n- “**Conventional low-yield**”: same but coupon=4% APR and cap=1.5×.\n\nSay the word and I’ll drop them in.",
