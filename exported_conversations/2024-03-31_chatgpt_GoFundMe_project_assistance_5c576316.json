He’s now a father and was recently captured in Lebanon and sent back to Syria where he fears for his life if he enters military service. \n\nGoal: Raise 8,000 to pay for his service and associated fees (money, transfer costs, trip to Syria for Saleh to help, etc) \n\nNeeds: I’d love some testimonials from people who met Ahmed and would like to share their experience with him. Sara Sibai? Shilo shiv Suleman? zeyn.joukhadar@gmail.com?\n\nPhotos folder, add photos here: https://photos.app.goo.gl/i6GaBCGiU4P5wMY69 \n\nDraft launchgood Campaign: https://www.launchgood.com/campaign/help_ahmed_stay_home_with_his_family_and_out_of_forced_military_service\n\nCampaign Title:\nCampaign Content:\nHelp Ahmed Stay With Family, Avoid Forced Service - Goal: $8,400\nAhemd with Baby Hadeel from Jan, 2024\n \nYears ago, before Ahmed became a refugee in Beirut his father was killed by the Asaad forces. He lived on the streets in Lebanon for years, being abused by police. He's unable to read/write. And given all this, he's still one of the nicest, most generous people I met in Lebanon and that's why I'm making this request for help.\nI met Ahmed when I first came to Lebanon in 2016. Beit Al Atlas was established as a safe home for people in our neighborhood inspired by the principle that “charity begins at home” - or the people closest to you deserve the most from you. Yourself, your family, your neighbors and further out. Ahmed certainly became a neighbor, and now I see him as a brother. \n\nOver the years Ahmed and I got closer, I remember him bringing whatever little food he had and cooking me Iftar in Ramadan and offering me a silver ring to be able to propose to Josephine, my wife. “Yallah Bilal, what’re you waiting for!” he would say. \nOver the years we tried so many ways to find him stable solutions while he was in Lebanon. I remember when we set him up with coffee equipment to sell coffee, but the police confiscated it, saying Syrians weren't allowed to work. \nAs a refugee in Lebanon without proper papers he’s having a difficult time. He is not able to visit his daughter, wife and mother in Syria and he can’t integrate into Lebanon. \nThis is why we are raising money to pay for Ahmed’s legal fees and establish his situation in Lebanon by also providing him a legal job at Cafe Al Atlas, the cafe that Saleh has founded on the first floor of Beit Al Atlas. Cafe Al Atlas is a startup cafe and needs some investment to become a destination in Beirut, sustaining both Ahmed’s and Saleh’s jobs. The strategy we’ve taken is to use Ahmed’s history planting figs and tomatoes on the rooftop of Beit Al Atlas and to turn Cafe Al Atlas into an oasis in Lebanon. We're reaching out for help to cover his legal fees, materials for the cafe, and the first few months of his salary. This will enable him to have a sustained job, and to be able to go back and forth to Syria more easily to spend time with his daughter, wife and mother, insha’allah all while creating a green fresh space for people in polluted Beirut AND supporting Saleh’s new initiative. It’s a win-win-win-win situation (fourth win is you ajr and joy for helping ;D!) \nThis message goes first to everyone who knew Ahmed from Beit Al Atlas, those he cooked potatoes for, helped paint murals, or assisted in gardening. To those who never met Ahmed but know me, your care can flow through my connection with him.\nBeit Al Atlas was cofounded in 2016 between me and Saleh, who was a 16 year old kid of the streets in those days having come from Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria and spending time in the Burj Al Barajne refugee camp in Lebanon. The house was built on the principle of our strange friendship. That those closest to us deserve our generosity and that we can build closeness across differences. I never thought I'd find a friend like Ahmed, but he became part of my world through Beit Al Atlas… He was literally our neighbor, polishing shoes a block away from our house. THrough Beit Al Atlas’s many dinners and events many others have connected with him too. You can see more info on Beit at https://alatlas.org \nWe're aiming to quickly raise the required amount for Ahmed's exemption. Our mutual Saleh will help to ensure that legal fees and cafe costs are spent intelligently. He is Lebanese and grew up in Syria during the war and is very familiar and street smart, there’s no one else I would trust more with helping us get Ahmed’s legal situation resolved.\nIf we exceed our target, the additional funds will support other friends in similar situations, like (ask in private for the name) in Turkey who's also struggling to make ends meet and avoid being sent back to Syria. No contribution will go to waste and all will be spent on the community of refugees that we've connected with over the years in Beit Al Atlas in Beirut whom we've not had the capacity to support.\nPlease donate generously. Your support means more than just financial aid; it's a gesture of solidarity and community, extending a helping hand to a friend who has always been there for others, even when he had little for himself. Thank you for your kindness and willingness to make a difference.\n\nAhmed is in Beirut, and his family is in Dar3ah. If you’re in Beirut you can join Ahmed and Saleh in Hamra at Cafe Al Atlas here on the first floor.\n\n \nYou can see our years of friendship in this photo gallery here. \nHere's a nice photo of the time Shilo and Nida from the Fearless Collective came to Lebanon and collaborated with Beit Al Atlas and the “boys” to paint a public art project to bring the community together around the concept of home. Come to think of it, this is a culmination of that project in some ways.

Here's a modified version:\n\n---\n\n**Cafe Al Atlas: A New Beginning for Ahmed and the Community**\n\n**Introduction:**\nI'm Bilal, a friend of Ahmed, whom I met during my time at Beit Al Atlas. Witnessing his challenges as a Syrian refugee in Lebanon, I've been inspired to help him find a stable and legal livelihood. That's where Cafe Al Atlas comes into play – a startup café that not only aims to provide Ahmed with a job but also to become a cherished destination in Beirut.\n\n**Campaign Goal:**\nWe are aiming to raise $8,000. This amount will cover Ahmed’s legal fees, necessary café materials, and his salary for the initial months, ensuring a steady start for both Ahmed and the café.\n\n**Our Vision for Cafe Al Atlas:**\nLocated on the first floor of Beit Al Atlas, the café aspires to be more than just a coffee shop. It's a vision to create an oasis in the midst of Beirut's hustle, a place that brings the community together. Ahmed's experience in farming is key to our concept – we plan to integrate greenery and homegrown produce into the café, echoing his expertise in planting figs and tomatoes.\n\n**How Your Contribution Helps:**\nYour support will help us in multiple ways:\n1. **Securing Ahmed's Livelihood**: Funding Ahmed's legal expenses and providing him a job at the café.\n2. **Establishing the Café**: Investing in café infrastructure and initial operating costs.\n3. **Creating a Community Space**: Aiding in the transformation of Cafe Al Atlas into a green, welcoming spot for all in Beirut.\n\n**Ahmed's Journey:**\nAhmed's resilience despite hardships as a refugee without proper documentation has been nothing short of remarkable. From his days of struggling on the streets to his aspirations today, his journey is a testament to the human spirit. This café is a step towards giving him the stability and dignity he deserves.\n\n**Join Us:**\nWe invite you to be a part of this journey. Whether you've known Ahmed, heard about Beit Al Atlas, or simply believe in our cause, your contribution will make a significant difference. Every donation not only supports Ahmed but also contributes to a larger vision of community and belonging.\n\n**Thank You:**\nYour generosity means more than just financial aid. It's a symbol of solidarity and a commitment to building a better world, one cup of coffee at a time. Visit us at Cafe Al Atlas in Hamra, where Ahmed, Saleh, and our team eagerly await to share our dream with you.\n\n---\n\nThis revised content focuses more on the café and its role in supporting Ahmed, while also outlining the broader community impact and inviting participation.",

I'm Krista Tippett. You're listening to my unedited conversation with\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000\n\nfather Greg Boyle. He's a Jesuit priest and the founder and executive director of Homeboy Industries\n00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000\n\nin Los Angeles. I spoke with him on July 10, 2012, in the Hall of Philosophy at the Chautauqua\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,480\n\nInstitution in New York. Download the MP3 of that produced show with Greg Boyle at OnBeing.org.\n00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,040\n\nSo, oh, are we on? No. So this is exactly the same as yesterday. We start with the mic not working\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,760\n\nand now I tell you that we're going to do 45 to 50 minutes of conversation up here and then we'll\n00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,200\n\nopen it up for some comments and questions from you. We need to finish today at 3.15 so I'm going\n00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,760\n\nto be the unhappy person who has to impose that. And I get to introduce Greg Boyle. Father Greg Boyle\n00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:57,120\n\nis a Jesuit priest and pastor of Dolores Mission in Los Angeles. And for over two decades he's created\n00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,880\n\nand led an enterprise which has become one of the most innovative and largest gang intervention\n00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,560\n\nprograms in the U.S. I love that. I love the train whistle. But it never happens when I'm in the radio\n00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,680\n\nstudio. Homeboy Industries helps former and current gang members turn their lives around. It employs\n00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:24,000\n\nyoung men and women. It employs young men and women by way of a number of businesses including a bakery,\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,200\n\na silk screen shop, and a maintenance business. It also offers free services from GED classes to\n00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,440\n\nlife counseling to tattoo removal. An op-ed in the Los Angeles Times in 2012 took this title,\n00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:42,960\n\n\"Nurturing Hope at Homeboy Industries. How Much Bleaker and Meener Would LA Be Without It?\"\n00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,360\n\nFather Greg became famous to a wide audience in the 1990s when a book was written about him called\n00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,000\n\nG-Dog and the Homeboys. And in 2010 he wrote his own very moving memoir called Tattoos on the Heart,\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,320\n\nThe Power of Boundless Compassion. I've been following your work for years and I'm so happy\n00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,560\n\nto talk to you today in this beautiful place. Thank you.\n00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,240\n\n[applause]\n00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120\n\nAnd so I want us to talk obviously about what you do, but really focus in on the why of it and\n00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:28,560\n\nyou know on what these experiences have worked in you and how they've formed your sense of who God\n00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,360\n\nis and what it means to be human. I think you talk about those things all the time, but to the extent\n00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,600\n\nthat I can focus even more I want to do that. But first of all, tell us how you came to your call to\n00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,560\n\nbe a Jesuit. First of all, it's so great to be here and I'm so honored to be in a conversation with you.\n00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,800\n\nI'm a big fan, though I do have a recurring nightmare that I'm interviewed by Christa Tippett\n00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,960\n\nand I'm found shallow and lacking faith. This is way better than the actual nightmare I have.\n00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:10,640\n\n[laughter]\n00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800\n\nWell, I was educated by Jesuits so I, you know, and for me they were always sort of this combo\n00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,880\n\nburger of absolute hilarity and joy and the most fun people to be around and they were prophetic.\n00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:26,560\n\nSo this was during the time of the Vietnam War and so we'd laugh a lot and I'd go with them to,\n00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,880\n\nyou know, protesting the war and so the combination of the prophetic and the hilarious,\n00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,400\n\nI loved that. So I thought, boy, I want to, I'll have what they're having, you know.\n00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,480\n\nSo that's what I did. It's not very deep, but that's kind of the reasons you join an organization\n00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:54,320\n\nlike the Society of Jesus aren't the reasons you stay, but that's kind of was my initial hook.\n00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,640\n\nRight. Why did you stay? Tell me that. I got a feeling you might have.\n00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,080\n\nWell, you know, I, again, it's la compaña de Jesuits is kind of what Saint Ignatius called\n00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:15,280\n\nthe thing. So it's about being in companionship with Jesus and Saint Ignatius in his spiritual\n00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,520\n\nexercises has a meditation called the two standards and in it he says very simply,\n00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:28,080\n\nsee Jesus standing in the lowly place. And so that is where I want to stand that in the end,\n00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:36,560\n\nit's about standing with Jesus. It's not about saluting a set of beliefs necessary. It's about\n00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,560\n\nwalking with Jesus and being a companion. And, and I haven't found anything that's brought me more\n00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:53,440\n\nlife or joy than standing with Jesus, but also with the particularity of standing in,\n00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,160\n\nin the lowly place with the easily despised and the readily left out and with the demonized so\n00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:08,480\n\nthat the demonizing will stop and with the disposable so that the day will come when we\n00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:16,080\n\nstop throwing people away. That gives me life. That's where I want to be. I think that's where\n00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,280\n\nJesus insists on standing and, and I, I find the fullness of life trying to as best I can in my own\n00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:29,680\n\nway to stand there. So that particular place where the Jesuits took you in 1986, is that right,\n00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:37,920\n\nas to the Dolores mission, which at that time, I don't know if this is still true, was the\n00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,920\n\npoorest parish in the city and had the highest concentration of gang activity in the world at\n00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,280\n\nthat time. Now you had grown up in Los Angeles, but I think a different Los Angeles. Yeah. Well,\n00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:57,440\n\nI had been in Bolivia and that sort of changed my life right after I was ordained. And then I was\n00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,840\n\nsupposed to go to Santa Clara University to kind of help transition students there into kind of\n00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,320\n\nhaving immersion programs with the poor. And then it didn't feel like enough once I had been\n00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,880\n\nconverted by the poor really in Bolivia. So I asked my provincial to send me to the poorest\n00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,960\n\nplace we have. And he sent me to Dolores mission, which at the time, as you mentioned, was had the\n00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,320\n\nhighest concentration of gang activity in the world was my parish. We had eight gangs that\n00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,400\n\nwere with each other and it was the largest grouping of public housing west of Mississippi.\n00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,040\n\nSo it had a lot of issues and I buried my first young person killed because of the sadness in '88\n00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:40,160\n\nand buried my 183rd about three weeks ago. Not all from that community, but because I worked\n00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,240\n\nwith gang members, I get asked to do this. So I didn't really fully understand what this all was\n00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,000\n\ngoing to mean, but I grew up in the gang capital of the world as well. Yeah. In Los Angeles. And yet,\n00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,680\n\nyou know, I can state with certainty that I wouldn't have joined a gang. You know, I wouldn't\n00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,960\n\nhave known where to find one if you sent me on a scavenger hunt, you know. And the fact that I\n00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,880\n\nwould not have joined, I couldn't have joined a gang, it wouldn't have happened, doesn't make me\n00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,640\n\nmorally superior to the young men and women I've been privileged to know for a quarter of a century.\n00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,160\n\nQuite the opposite, you know, that what they have to carry and navigate is not what I ever was asked\n00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,280\n\nto carry or navigate as a teenager growing up in the same city as they did. So I was on the west side\n00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,400\n\nand Dolores Mission was on the east side. You've often told the story of the first,\n00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,280\n\nthe first kid you buried. Is that right? Who was an identical twin as kind of a\n00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,080\n\nparable about the tragedy of this? His name was Rafael, an identical twin, even the mom,\n00:07:50,080 --> 00:08:00,080\n\nI think had a hard time telling them apart. But at the funeral, as he was laying in his coffin,\n00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,800\n\nhis identical twin Roberto was peering down into the coffin as if you had slapped a mirror,\n00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,600\n\nand he was kind of gazing at a mirror image of himself. And there was something about\n00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,680\n\nyoung men staring at, frankly, the mirror image of themselves in a coffin that seemed\n00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:24,240\n\nto get at what this was, at least in part. But at least that was my first introduction to the great\n00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:32,640\n\nloss and the unspeakable grief of it. And there's so much grief and so much heartbreak\n00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:41,200\n\nin these kids' lives and in the stories that you tell. And yet, you always come back again and\n00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:50,880\n\nagain to talking in this way, you know, that spiritually, theologically, this is not so much\n00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,840\n\nabout helping others. I'm saying that, but this is fundamentally about our common call to delight\n00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,800\n\nin one another. I think that's very unexpected language. Well, Dorothy Day, I think she quotes\n00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:10,800\n\nRuskin when she always talks about the duty to delight. And I think it's right to see it as a\n00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,520\n\nduty because you have to be absolutely conscious of it. But it's really a delighting that enters\n00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:25,840\n\ninto full kinship with each other, that the idea is to how do we find ways to luxuriate in mutuality.\n00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:34,560\n\nGreatly privileged in my life to have known Cesar Chavez, who was an extraordinary leader of a\n00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:43,440\n\nmovement, but was also one of the best listeners I'd ever known. He could just, you were the only\n00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,080\n\nperson who existed if you were having a conversation with him. But I remember once a reporter had\n00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,360\n\ncommented to him and said, \"Wow, these farm workers, they sure love you.\" And Cesar just shrugged and\n00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,640\n\nsmiled and he said, \"The feeling's mutual.\" And that's what you hope for. You know, I'm not the\n00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,040\n\ngreat healer and that gang member over there is in need of my exquisite healing. The truth is,\n00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,280\n\nit's mutual. And that as much as we are called to bridge the distance that exists between us,\n00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,120\n\nwe have to acknowledge that there's a distance even in service. You know, a service provider,\n00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,680\n\nyou're the service recipient, and you want to bridge even that so that you can get to this place\n00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,560\n\nof utter mutuality where the feeling's mutual. And I think that's where the place of delight is,\n00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:39,040\n\nyou know, that I've learned everything of value really in the last 25 years from precisely the\n00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,600\n\npeople who you think are on the receiving end of my gifts and talent and wisdom and advice,\n00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:54,960\n\nbut quite the opposite. It's mutual. And I think it's really, I always like hearing people tell\n00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:04,400\n\nabout the things they did that didn't work out on the way to the things that they know. And it's a\n00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,040\n\nvery interesting, one of the ways you tried to serve when you first arrived there was you were\n00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,680\n\ngoing to be a peacemaker, right? You were going to make truce between these warring gangs. And you\n00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,000\n\nfound that in fact that, which maybe seemed obvious, wasn't right. Well, you know, a lot of\n00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,400\n\nanything worth doing is worth failing at, I think. That'll be on my tombstone. You know, we have\n00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:40,720\n\nseven businesses, but not all of them worked. Homeboy plumbing was really not a huge success.\n00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,800\n\nApparently people didn't want gang members in their homes. I didn't see that coming.\n00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,280\n\nBut in the early days, those eight gangs were indigenous. And as much as they all lived in the\n00:11:53,280 --> 00:12:00,560\n\nprojects and they lived in my parish, which is kind of not true now. Gangs are sort of a commuter\n00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,920\n\nreality, at least in Los Angeles. So it seemed sensible to me. And we'd have these Pyrrhic\n00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,360\n\nvictories of let's agree not to shoot into each other's houses. I mean, that seems kind of not\n00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,200\n\nmuch of a victory, but those were kinds of, we'd have cease fires and truces and peace treaties.\n00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,360\n\nAnd it was a lot of shuttle diplomacy where I would, I'd actually write up a kind of a thing,\n00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,960\n\nyou know, and they, one side would sign it, the other side would sign it. And it would work for\n00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,800\n\na time, but I don't regret that I ever did that. And I never do it again, just because it, if you\n00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,360\n\nwork with gangs, you provide oxygen to gangs. And that's not a good thing. And I can see that now.\n00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,640\n\nBut it was a historically necessary moment, probably. So it's enough to say that,\n00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,960\n\nhonest to God, don't regret it. But at Homeboy Industries, we don't work with gangs. We work\n00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:58,480\n\nwith gang members and that feels more sensible. Right. And was that part of your path on the way\n00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,400\n\nto learning to that emphasis? Yeah. You know, you don't want to serve the cohesion of the gang,\n00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,920\n\nbecause, you know, as I just was texting a homie who, they've taught me how to text and I couldn't\n00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:17,200\n\nbe more grateful to them. And I'm finding that it sure beats the heck out of actually talking to\n00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,680\n\npeople. So what did he text you about today? Well, he had, I don't know how they do this,\n00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:31,680\n\nyou know, sometimes I have a tagline. I don't know what that is. And you give a text and then\n00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,680\n\nthere's a little tagline that you've put in that sort of permanent feature to every missive, you\n00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,280\n\nknow, and his was the name of his gang. And so I questioned that and I said, why do you still have\n00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,320\n\nthat? And I said, if you can name a single good thing that's come into your life because of that\n00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,200\n\ngang, please continue to have that as your tagline or whatever the word is. Hashtag, I think, but I'm\n00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,480\n\nnot sure. What's it called? Hashtag. Hashtag. Mitch, is this right? I don't know. I'm lame when it comes\n00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,000\n\nto these things. But, you know, it forced him to kind of say, name one good thing. And he couldn't\n00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,760\n\nname one good thing, which is precisely the point. And so if you can't name a single good thing,\n00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,000\n\nthen why are you saluting it? Why are you pledging allegiance to it? You know, this is all part of\n00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,520\n\nthe process. So you're having this conversation with him via texting. That's great. From Chautauqua.\n00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:31,120\n\nYou're ahead of me, yes, from Chautauqua. But, I mean, one of the things you've, one of the\n00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:40,560\n\nrealizations you've said you made out of that is that peacemaking requires conflict. And while\n00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,280\n\nthere's lots of violence between gangs, there's not conflict that you can define like you can with a\n00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,000\n\nwar. Yeah, it's difficult because I'm sort of the dissenting voice, I think, in the country at the\n00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,120\n\nmoment when it comes to this thing. And sometimes people will say to you, well, how can you be\n00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,480\n\nagainst peacemaking? Well, obviously, I'm not against peacemaking. But I'm old-fashioned that I think,\n00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,360\n\nyou know, peacemaking requires conflict. And it's important to say that there is no conflict in gang\n00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,320\n\nviolence. There's violence, but there's no conflict. So it's not about anything. So you want to understand\n00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,200\n\nwhat language is gang violence speaking. That's important to me. It's about a lethal absence of\n00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:24,800\n\nhope. It's about kids who can't imagine a future for themselves. It's about kids who aren't seeking\n00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,640\n\nanything when they join a gang. It's about the fact that they're always flinging something, always,\n00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,520\n\nwithout exception. So it shifts the way you see things. And, you know, somebody, Bertrand\n00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:45,280\n\nRussell or somebody said, if you want to change the world, change the metaphor. And that's kind of how\n00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,600\n\nwe want to, I think we need to proceed in something like this. So if you think it's the Middle East,\n00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,480\n\nyou're quite mistaken. If you think it's Northern Ireland, wrong again. It's about kids who\n00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,440\n\ncease to care. So you want to infuse young people with hope when it seems that hope is foreign.\n00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:10,560\n\nAnd as you tell their stories, it's hard to imagine where they would draw hope from. I mean,\n00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:20,240\n\na lot of them, I don't know, I mean, it's not just that many of them have been abandoned or\n00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,920\n\nthat they come from a single parent home. You know, the stories that stuck with me were the\n00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,560\n\nkid whose father left them on the day of his sixth birthday while they were all waiting to light the\n00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,800\n\ncandles for his dad to come home or the one whose mother literally tortured him because she reminded\n00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:46,880\n\nhim so much of his terrible father. And there's drug and violence and incarceration in these\n00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,640\n\nkids' families. I mean, what also occurs to me, though, because you know them, right? You take\n00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,880\n\ndelight in them and you love them. I think that also gives you, again, with reference to American\n00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:06,160\n\nculture at large, a much more, well, a sense of how the lines between, you know, what it means to be\n00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,000\n\nan enemy or a friend or a victim or a survivor, how those things blur in real, messy human life.\n00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,160\n\nWell, you know, lately I've been reading the Acts of the Apostles really carefully. And if you start\n00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,120\n\nto read it and think it's a kind of a quaint snapshot of the earliest Christian community,\n00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,040\n\nthat's one thing. But what if you were to read it as a measure of the health of any community?\n00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,400\n\nSo you, you know, see how they love one another or there is nobody in need in this community,\n00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,240\n\nfor example. But my favorite one is it looked off the page to me and it says, \"And awe came upon\n00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,280\n\neveryone.\" So that the measure of our compassion lies not in our service of those on the margins,\n00:17:51,280 --> 00:18:01,680\n\nbut in our willingness to see ourselves in kinship. And so that means the decided movement\n00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:08,960\n\ntowards awe and giant steps away from judgment. So how can we seek really a compassion that can\n00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:18,640\n\nstand in awe at what people have to carry rather than stand in judgment at how they carry it? And\n00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,800\n\nI think that's sort of the key here. That's the place of health in any community,\n00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,200\n\nforgot Christian community, in any community, that's how you know that you're healthy.\n00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,160\n\nSo recently I gave a talk, a training, all day training to 600 social workers,\n00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,440\n\ntraining on gangs. I had two homies with me and one of them was a guy named Jose and he got up\n00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,600\n\nand I just stood there. He's in his late 20s and he now works in a substance abuse part of our team,\n00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:56,800\n\na man in recovery and been a heroin addict and gang member and tattooed. And he gets up and he says,\n00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:03,120\n\nvery offhandedly, you know, I guess you could say that my mom and me, we didn't get along so good.\n00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,320\n\nI guess I was six when she looked at me and she said, \"Why don't you just kill yourself?\n00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:16,480\n\nYou're such a burden to me.\" Well, the whole audience did what you just did, the ghast. And\n00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,200\n\nthen he said, \"It sounds way worser in Spanish,\" he said, you know, and everybody did what you just\n00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,680\n\ndid, you know. And then he said, \"You know, I guess I was nine when my mom drove me down to the deepest\n00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:36,560\n\npart of Baja, California.\" And she walked me up to an orphanage and she said, \"I found this kid.\"\n00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:43,040\n\nAnd then he said, \"I was there 90 days until my grandmother could get out of her where\n00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,680\n\nshe had dumped me and she came and rescued me.\" And then he tells the audience, \"My mom beat me\n00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,680\n\nevery single day with things you could imagine and a lot of things you couldn't. My back was bloodied\n00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:02,320\n\nand raw and scarred. In fact, I had to wear three t-shirts to school every day, the first t-shirt\n00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,440\n\nbecause the blood would seep through and then the second t-shirt you could still see the blood and\n00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,960\n\nfinally the third t-shirt you couldn't see in any blood. Kids would make fun of me at school,\n00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,680\n\nthey'd say, \"A fool, it's 100 degrees why you're wearing three t-shirts.\" And then he kind of loses\n00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:26,560\n\nthe battle with his own tears a little bit and he says, \"I wore three t-shirts well into my adult\n00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:35,360\n\nyears because I was ashamed of my wounds. I didn't want anybody to see them.\n00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,600\n\nBut now my wounds are my friends. I welcome my wounds. I run my fingers over my wounds.\"\n00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,080\n\nAnd then he looks at this crowd and he says, \"How can I help the wounded if I don't welcome my own\n00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:57,840\n\nwounds?\" And awe came upon everyone because we're so inclined to kind of judge this kid who,\n00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:07,360\n\nyou know, went to prison and is tattooed and is a gang member and homeless and heroin addict and\n00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,680\n\nthe list goes on, but he was never seeking anything when he ended up in those places.\n00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:19,760\n\nHe was always fleeing the story I just told you. You know, I think awe then also is an antidote\n00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:28,560\n\nto something that keeps us paralyzed like judgment, which is just an overwhelming sadness\n00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:36,000\n\nand a feeling like what's happened to that person is so terrible. How can I possibly respond?\n00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,760\n\nI wonder how you, I mean, awe, I think you're telling us that that's how you\n00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,000\n\nmeet that actually, as you've said, and find delight.\n00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,840\n\nYeah, but you also, a burnout comes, I was having this conversation with a woman who worked in\n00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:03,200\n\nKosovo and this was just yesterday in Key West where I gave a talk and I don't know, you know,\n00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:10,960\n\nthe presumption is that burnout comes from just being overwhelmed with what you just described,\n00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,120\n\nbut it also comes with seeking and striving after success. We all want to be effective. There's\n00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:25,600\n\nnothing wrong with that, but it can't be the engine that drives what you do. You know,\n00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,920\n\nMother Teresa says, \"We're not called to be successful. We're called to be faithful.\"\n00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,040\n\nSo the more that you can stay anchored in your own fidelity rather than outcomes, and yet in a\n00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:42,480\n\nprogram like mine and any other nonprofit, and people here might know what I'm talking about,\n00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,880\n\nyou know, it's all about evidence-based outcomes, you know, and nonsense. You know, you just want\n00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,080\n\nto be faithful. You want to believe in an approach you believe in and you want to stay dedicated to\n00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,320\n\nit and faithful to it, and that success is sort of, you know, God's concern, but the minute you start\n00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,440\n\nto save people, I was interviewed recently by PBS and the guy was saying, \"Obviously you've been such\n00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:14,800\n\na mentor to all these young men and women who have been your mentors,\" and I said, \"These young men\n00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,440\n\nand women have been my mentors,\" you know, and I don't think he liked the answer because it's,\n00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,400\n\nand I'm not being, you know, cute, you know, because I think that's honest to God the truth,\n00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,200\n\nthat I'm not saving anybody, that I experience salvation every day. So when I need patience,\n00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:44,480\n\nthe homies save me from my impatience, you know, and when I lack courage, they save me from my\n00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:54,000\n\ncowardice, and this happens only all the time. So something I think a lot about is how in\n00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:06,960\n\nthis culture, we've overused and watered down some of the words we need the most that actually\n00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:18,240\n\nmean the most. Compassion is one of them. Love is another. You talked about this a minute ago,\n00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,600\n\nI mean, you started talking about compassion, but I'd like to put some more flesh on those\n00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,960\n\nbones of those words, and I wonder, you know, if you think about compassion or love, you know,\n00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,920\n\nare there people who come to mind or moments that come to mind that really express what\n00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:43,600\n\nthese words have come to mean lived? Well, if you presume that God is compassionate,\n00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,760\n\nloving kindness, that all we're asked to do in the world is to be in the world who God is,\n00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,880\n\nand so you're always trying to, but that's huge. Yeah, that's huge. Yeah. And so you're trying to\n00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:05,920\n\nimitate the kind of God you believe in. You want to move away from whatever is tiny-spirited and\n00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,560\n\njudgmental, as I mentioned, but you want to be as spacious as you can be, that you can have room for\n00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,480\n\nstuff, and love is all there is, and love is all you are, you know, and you want people to\n00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,360\n\nrecognize the truth of who they are, that they're exactly what God had in mind when God made them.\n00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,440\n\nAlice Miller, who's the late great child psychologist, talked about, we're all called\n00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,040\n\nto be enlightened witnesses, you know, people who through your kindness and tenderness and focused\n00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,760\n\nattentive love return people to themselves, and in the process you return to yourself, you know.\n00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,840\n\nLike I have a homie named Louie who's just turned 18, and he's kind of a\n00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:57,920\n\ndifficult kid, you know, he's exasperating and he's whiny, and he works for me, although work may be\n00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:06,000\n\ntoo strong a verb, but homies lately have asked me for blessings, and which is odd, it's like in the\n00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,200\n\nlast three years, and they never, they always ask me on the street or in my office, and they never say,\n00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,960\n\n\"Father, may I have your blessing?\" They always say, \"A.G., give me a bless, yeah.\"\n00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,160\n\nAnd they always say it the same way, so this kid Louie, I'm talking to him, and he's complaining\n00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:31,120\n\nabout something, and finally at the end of it he says, \"A.G., give me a bless, yeah.\" I said, \"Sure,\"\n00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:38,000\n\nso he comes around to my side of the desk and he knows the drill, and he bows his head, and I put\n00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,240\n\nmy hands on his shoulder, and well, his birthday had been two days before, so it gave me an\n00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,360\n\nopportunity to say something to him, and I said, \"You know, Louie, I'm proud to know you, and\n00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,160\n\nmy life is richer because you came into it, and when you were born, you know, the world became a\n00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,920\n\nbetter place, and I'm proud to call you my son.\" Even though, and I don't know why I decided to add\n00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:07,600\n\nthis part, at times you can really be a huge pain in the ass, and he looks over at you and he\n00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:16,720\n\nsmiles, he says, \"The feeling's mutual.\" And, you know, suddenly kinship so quickly, you know,\n00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:27,280\n\nyou're not sort of this delivery system, you know, but maybe I return him to himself,\n00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,960\n\nbut there is no doubt that he's returned me to myself.\n00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,280\n\nUm, you use this word \"spacious,\" and actually synonyms for \"spacious\" are there all over the\n00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:54,160\n\nplace, especially in your memoir, when you're talking about God. God can get tiny if we're not\n00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,040\n\ncareful, that's an antonym, my son would point out. The spaciousness of God, the vastness of God,\n00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,640\n\nthe largeness of God, you quote Hafez, this great wild God, God's limitless magnanimity.\n00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:12,000\n\nAnd again, I just want to say, um, that's very exciting, you know, really emboldening language,\n00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,520\n\nbut it's not, I don't think it's a language people would ever reach for themselves if they were\n00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:26,720\n\nshown the statistics about the part of town you minister in, you know, or pictures.\n00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,360\n\nAnd so how do you think about that gap, that disconnect?\n00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,640\n\nWell, you know, uh, I'm a Jesuit, so, you know, Ignatius always talks about the God who is always\n00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:45,680\n\ngreater, and that is part of, you know, the issue whenever you land on a God who's tiny or\n00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:52,480\n\njudgmental or exacting or concerned with some kind of purity code or, and it sort of blows it wide\n00:28:52,480 --> 00:29:00,160\n\nopen and knowing that there's a need to have this blown wide open all the time. And so, you know,\n00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:08,000\n\nyou find the spaciousness, uh, in this grace and this vast thing. I can remember walking in the\n00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,440\n\nprojects late at night long ago and there was a kid named Mario and it was late at night and I\n00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,200\n\nwould always kind of either ride my bike or walk in the projects late late at night to kind of see\n00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,000\n\nwhat was going on. And there was this kid Mario sitting by himself, 16 years old, just sitting on\n00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,800\n\nhis little stoop in front of the crumby old projects. So I see him and I greet him and,\n00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,400\n\n\"Hey, how you doing?\" And I sit down next to him and he goes, \"It's funny that you should show up\n00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,640\n\nright now.\" And I say, \"Why?\" \"Well, I was just sitting here praying.\" And I thought, \"Wow, you know,\n00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,040\n\nnot too much of a judgment on my own prayer life, you know, and there he is. I was just sitting here\n00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:55,680\n\npraying.\" And I said, \"God, show me a sign that you're as great as I think you are and then you\n00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:06,320\n\nshowed up.\" Well, I just think, you know, I remember how moved I was by that, you know, and it's how you\n00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:17,360\n\nenter into the vastness in the spacious place that God holds. But it came by way of knowing\n00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:26,640\n\nthat the day won't ever come when I am as holy as the people I'm called to serve,\n00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,760\n\nthat the day won't ever come when I have more courage or I'm more noble or I'm closer to God\n00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:43,120\n\nthan the 16-year-old gang member sitting alone on his porch.\n00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,000\n\nAnd that's important because I think that's sort of where the vastness of God resides, you know, and\n00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:57,920\n\nbut Woody Allen used to say about death, you know, \"I'm not afraid of dying. I just don't want to be\n00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:04,720\n\nthere when it happens,\" you know, and but the same thing is true about the vastness of God is you want\n00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,000\n\nto be attentive because it's happening, you know, right here and right now and right in this place.\n00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,520\n\nWhat your ministry so bespeaks is this incarnational heart of Christianity, you know,\n00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:27,440\n\nbut that it always comes down to relationship between people that that's where we discover God as well.\n00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:36,400\n\nWell, it's relational but it's also, you know, Walter Brueggemann always talks about the\n00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:43,040\n\nscandal of the particular and this is, if I could speak as a Catholic, it's a little disheartening\n00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:50,400\n\nright now because it's, you know, I think we're afraid of the incarnation, you know, we're afraid\n00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:58,880\n\nof the scandal of the particular and part of it, the fear that drives us is that we have to have our\n00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:08,480\n\nsacred in a certain way. It has to be gold plated and cost of millions and cast of thousands or\n00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,960\n\nsomething. I don't know, you know, it just this is very kind of in-house but, you know, we just\n00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,840\n\nchanged the language in our liturgy and it was fear-driven, you know, because people, bishops,\n00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:30,000\n\nor I don't know who makes these decisions, but they said we're afraid that people will forget\n00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,360\n\nthat the Eucharist is sacred and so, okay, well let's go back to the original Latin, translate it\n00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,240\n\ninto an English that is not spoken anywhere in the English-speaking world and\n00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,960\n\nand it's disheartening because, you know, you have to be mindful of things that are fear-driven\n00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:58,880\n\ndecisions that we make and so we've wrestled the cup out of Jesus's hand and we've replaced it with\n00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,280\n\na chalice because who doesn't know that a chalice is more sacred than a cup? Never mind that Jesus\n00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:13,280\n\ndidn't use a chalice because if it's gold plated and jewel encrusted it is more sacred and a story\n00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:22,400\n\nI tell in the book about a homie who was on Christmas Day, I said what you do on Christmas\n00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,320\n\nand he was an orphan and abandoned and abused and by his parents and worked for me and our graffiti\n00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,840\n\ncrew and I said what you do for Christmas? Oh, just right here. I said alone and he said no,\n00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,320\n\nI invited six other guys from the graffiti crew who didn't have no place to go, he said,\n00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,560\n\nand they were all, he named them and they were enemies with each other. I said what you do? He\n00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:51,680\n\ngoes you're not gonna believe it, I cooked a turkey. I said well how'd you prepare the turkey?\n00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:58,640\n\nHe says you know ghetto style and I said no I don't think I'm familiar with that recipe and\n00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,640\n\nhe said well you rub it with a gang of butter and you squeeze two limones on and you put salt and\n00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,880\n\npepper put in the oven, tasted proper, he said. I said wow well what else did you have besides\n00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:15,440\n\nturkey? That's it, just turkey. Yeah, the seven of us we just sat in the kitchen staring at the oven\n00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:23,120\n\nwaiting for the turkey to be done. Did I mention it tasted proper? I said yeah. So what could be\n00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:32,560\n\nmore sacred than seven orphans, enemies, rivals sitting in a kitchen waiting for a turkey to be\n00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:41,280\n\ndone? Jesus doesn't lose any sleep that we will forget that the Eucharist is sacred. He is\n00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,520\n\nanxious that we might forget that it's ordinary, that it's a meal shared among friends, because if\n00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:56,960\n\nwe don't see that they will be unable to recognize the sacred in the ordinary and that's the\n00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:07,040\n\nincarnation I think. I suppose you could cut that out later when it's broadcast.\n00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:20,880\n\nI will I will decide when that gets cut, it may stay in. Yeah, maybe in case the Vatican listens to your show.\n00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:30,560\n\nBut just a little of a p.s. on that one. I was giving a talk somewhere where a priest was talking\n00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,720\n\nto me and he was lamenting a directive that had just come from a bishop that said you may not\n00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,360\n\ngive eulogies, allow eulogies in the funeral mass anymore and the priest may not mention the name of\n00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:54,000\n\nthe deceased in his homily, in the homily. And again what's the fear? The fear is that what if\n00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,680\n\nwe don't talk about the resurrection enough? You know where do you begin with something like that?\n00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,200\n\nBut that underscores the fact that we are frightened of the incarnation and we're afraid\n00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,800\n\nwhat we have to give up and I'm all for the resurrection, you know. But that's what Jesus\n00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,720\n\nis hoping for, is that you're going to be able to talk about this person who has died and speak to\n00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,440\n\nthe ways in which this deceased person has pointed beyond himself to the God who loves us without\n00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:34,240\n\nmeasure and without regret. That's wonderful, that's what the celebration is about.\n00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,040\n\nI might cut that out just in case that bishop is listening.\n00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,560\n\nI hope he is.\n00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,360\n\nI hope he's listening to you is what I meant.\n00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:54,480\n\nOkay, all right. I know that's what you meant. In terms of just this idea of incarnation and\n00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,800\n\nrelationship, I mean it took me a long time into my research reading about you and reading you to\n00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:08,000\n\nrealize that one of the transformative things that happens in homeboy industries, which is a different\n00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,040\n\nmodel from your peacemaker days, is that people are simply working side by side, kids who may have\n00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:23,120\n\nbeen in different gangs, they're sharing days and time and jobs, is that right? I mean,\n00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,720\n\nand my question also is like, does it surprise you at this point in your life that what, you know,\n00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,160\n\none of the, some of the structure your vocation has taken is in starting these businesses?\n00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,600\n\nYeah, you don't want to hear me talk about businesses, you know, I'm the least knowledgeable\n00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:46,560\n\nperson on how to start. It's like, don't try this at home. I'm a CEO. Oh my gosh, I'm a CEO.\n00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,160\n\nYeah, I'm missing a board meeting to be here today. So I could not be one bit happier.\n00:37:52,560 --> 00:38:01,920\n\nYeah, you know, I'm kind of Mr. Magoo when it comes to businesses. So I don't.\n00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:10,000\n\nYeah. Okay. But look, there's homeboy bakery, homeboy, still screen, homeboy maintenance,\n00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,320\n\nhomeboy slash homegirl merchandise, homegirl cafe. Those are businesses.\n00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,640\n\nYou employ people. Yeah. And that came, that was born as we began as sort of a job employment\n00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,920\n\nreferral center, trying to find felony friendly employers. And that wasn't so forthcoming. So\n00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,960\n\nby 92, we had to start our own, we really, we couldn't wait. The demand was so huge. And\n00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,720\n\nand gang members kept saying if only we had jobs. So we started homeboy bakery in 1992. And\n00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,000\n\na month later, we started homeboy tortillas in the grand central market, historic kind of area in LA.\n00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,080\n\nOnce we had two, once we had plural, you know, we came up with the highfalutin\n00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,960\n\nhomeboy industries, you know, as if there was any industry involved in this venture, you know, so.\n00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,280\n\nSo yeah, and we started all these businesses. And then the idea is not just to have a paycheck,\n00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,760\n\nbut I think one of the new things that I kind of discovered probably in the last five years\n00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,040\n\nis that community trumps gang. So it's not enough to just say, here's a job, our motto,\n00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,040\n\nstill on our t shirts is nothing stops a bullet like a job. But that does about 80% of what needs\n00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:24,480\n\nto be done. You know, there's still the other 20%, which is relational, and it's about healing. And\n00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,080\n\nit's about what psychologists would call attachment repair, you know, because gang members come to us\n00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:36,480\n\nwith this disorganized attachment, you know, mom was frightening, or frightened. And you can't really\n00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:44,080\n\nsoothe yourself if you've never been calmed down by that significant person in your life. And it's\n00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:51,680\n\nnever too late to kind of gain this. So they, they repair this attachment, and they learn some\n00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,000\n\nresilience, and then they redefine who they are in the world, which is really a huge task. And then\n00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,480\n\nwe send them on beyond us. And then the world will throw at them what it will, but it won't topple\n00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,040\n\nthem, because they're this renewed person that that sort of, I've been doing this for 25 years,\n00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:17,280\n\nthat's sort of the new piece. In the last five years, that there's a task that happens and needs\n00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,080\n\nto be addressed and attended to. And that's the task, you know, were you attending to it before,\n00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:30,480\n\nbut not as intentionally? I mean, it was happening. That's right. You've named it now. Yeah. And, but\n00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,000\n\nthings like therapy, you know, everybody's in therapy, and I have, you know, 300 employees, and,\n00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,120\n\nand I have four paid therapists, but I have 41 volunteer therapists. So, so, but that's kind of\n00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:48,800\n\na new openness to that. That wasn't true. In my first 10 years, homies would always say,\n00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,160\n\nOh, I'm not crazy. And, you know, and there was a stigma, you know, and then I noticed it, I don't\n00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,760\n\nknow how many years ago, maybe 15 years ago, homies would, I'd say, you know, it might help you to talk\n00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,560\n\nabout all the stuff you've been through in your life. And then a homie once said to me, you mean,\n00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,360\n\nlike analyze this. And he referenced that, that movie with Billy Crystal and Robert DeNiro. And\n00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:18,080\n\nthen I started hearing that. And that you talk about a tipping point where suddenly it was okay\n00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,080\n\nfor people to be in therapy. And, and so I don't sense any kind of stigma, which is really healthy\n00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,720\n\nand wonderful, because they have a lot of work to do. They've, they've been through a lot.\n00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,880\n\nI'm going to ask one more question. Then why don't, why don't we start open this up for questions and\n00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:42,240\n\ncomments. You, I've read were diagnosed with leukemia. Would that have been a decade ago now?\n00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:50,640\n\nI think it's probably, I think it's nine years. Nine years. But as the homies say,\n00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,920\n\nI hear your cancer's in intermission.\n00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,680\n\nAnd I always tell them, apparently it's stepped up to the lobby to buy popcorn.\n00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:11,040\n\nMay the line be long. Yeah. So I'm okay. Well, yeah. But what this means is that you,\n00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:20,160\n\nin a less adrenaline fueled way than a lot of the people you share life with have faced mortality.\n00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,200\n\nAnd I wonder, has that changed the way you move through life or even this work with them?\n00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:34,480\n\nYeah. You know, first of all, I wouldn't trade that period of my life for anything. It's\n00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,760\n\nwas about the most graced moment in my life for as uncomfortable as chemotherapy is. And I'm sure\n00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,720\n\nmany in the audience have been through this. I wouldn't, I wouldn't trade it because it was just\n00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,600\n\nso intimate and so mutual. And, and it reminded me how to put first things recognizably first and,\n00:42:51,600 --> 00:43:02,160\n\nand to live as though the truth were true. I mean, this was, but with the homies, it was this\n00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:09,680\n\nextraordinary place of exquisite mutuality that I really, you know, treasure. I was reading recently\n00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:20,240\n\nabout the Dalai Lama. He was interviewed in the New Yorker and somebody asked him about his own\n00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,560\n\npersonal death and he just shrugged and he said, change of clothing. And that was sort of my\n00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:33,680\n\nexperience when I went through leukemia and greatly liberating. And, but because I've had to bury so\n00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,960\n\nmany kids, I, 183 kids and kids I loved and kids I knew and killed by kids I loved. I mean,\n00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:48,480\n\nboy, if, if death is the worst thing that can happen to you, brace yourself because you will be\n00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:55,760\n\ntoppled. And, and the trick is not to be toppled. The trick is to, to compile a list of all the\n00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:05,360\n\nfates that are worse than death, but also compile the list of all the things and so numerous to\n00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:13,120\n\nlist all the things that are more powerful than, than death. And, and that's important because\n00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:21,280\n\ndeath hits this community a lot and kids who are doing really well, you know, are waiting for a\n00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,120\n\nbus and somebody sees them and remembers their past. We've had a couple of those this year and,\n00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:34,000\n\nand they're toppling, but you have to kind of make sure that folks are, put it in its place. You\n00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:42,800\n\nalways say death is a punk. You have to just put it in its place, which is what gang members, that's\n00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,520\n\nhow gang members talk, but I think that's sort of the truth. You know, that's what Jesus did. Jesus\n00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,480\n\nsort of put death in its place. Was it, after your diagnosis that you discovered this, this story\n00:44:52,480 --> 00:45:02,720\n\nabout the Desert Fathers and mothers that they would, the one word they meditated on was, oh,\n00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,320\n\nI just, I read that a couple days ago as I was getting ready for this and it's been so\n00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:14,320\n\nhelpful for me. Yeah, they, whenever the Desert Fathers and mothers would get\n00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,200\n\nabsolutely despondent and, and didn't know how they were going to put one foot in front of the next,\n00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,840\n\nthey had this mantra and the mantra wasn't God and the mantra, the word wasn't Jesus,\n00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:31,520\n\nbut the word was today. And that, that's sort of the key. There's a play off Broadway right now\n00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:40,400\n\ncalled Now Hear This. It's now period here, H-E-R-E period, this period. And that's kind of my,\n00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:50,160\n\nthat's become my mantra. I'm big on mantra. So, so when I'm walking or,\n00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,360\n\nI always, before a kid comes into my office, I always say now hear this, now hear this,\n00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:03,120\n\nso that I'll be present right here to the person in front of me.\n00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,840\n\nDavid Brooks has a kind of oyve column in today's New York Times. Using Robert Putnam's\n00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:34,960\n\nnew research that indicates the growing divide among the children of the rich and the children\n00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:45,600\n\nof the poor in this, in this country. And he prognosticates that we will become as a society\n00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:54,160\n\neven more divided than we are now. So I'm thinking that, that you've already told me the answer to\n00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:02,720\n\nthis question, which is now hear this. But I, I hear you. I am moved by your work. I am moved by\n00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:13,600\n\nthe plight of the poor. And I am here for a week. And then I go back to my privileged life in\n00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:23,360\n\nFairfield County, Connecticut, among my Unitarian Universalist co-congregants. What is the message?\n00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:35,680\n\nWhat is there to be done beside shrugging my shoulders and writing a check?\n00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:42,720\n\nUm, don't stop writing the checks, first of all.\n00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,400\n\nI owe that to my board meeting that's happening right now.\n00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,840\n\nOkay. So I buy the indulgence and then what happens?\n00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,880\n\nThat's where I say oy vey. So, uh, you know, the answer really is kinship. Everybody's so\n00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:08,480\n\nexhausted by kind of the tenor of the polarity right now in our country. And it's, uh, and the\n00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,840\n\ndivision is the opposite of God, frankly, you know, uh, there's a Mayan expression, uh, I am the other\n00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:21,040\n\nyou and you are the other me. And any way we can, uh, move closer to obliterating the illusion that\n00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:29,120\n\nwe're separate. You know, I always think of divies with Lazarus. Divies is in hell, not because he's\n00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:35,520\n\nrich, but because he kind of refused to be in relationship with Lazarus. That, that, that parable\n00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:45,600\n\nis not about bank accounts and heaven. It's really about us. And so, you know, what's on Jesus's mind?\n00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:54,320\n\nHe says that all may be one and that's kind of where we need to inch our way closer that,\n00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,640\n\nthat we imagine a circle of compassion. Then we imagine nobody standing outside that circle.\n00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,920\n\nSo how do we dismantle the barriers that exclude? How do we dedicate ourselves in our own way? And\n00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:14,000\n\nyou know, working with Fairfield university, a good Jesuit university there, or anybody, you know,\n00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,000\n\nin your community, how do you do this? How do you participate in the birth of a new inclusion\n00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,600\n\nwhere nobody's left out? And, and, and that takes humility. You know, I, you know, the, the,\n00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:32,880\n\nthat story also of divies and Lazarus, it's about humility versus hubris. You know, humility asks\n00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:40,160\n\nthe poor and folks on the margins, what do you need? How can I help? Hubris says, here's what\n00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:46,880\n\nyour problem is and here's how you fix yourself. And, and, and that's kind of underscores what the\n00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,720\n\ndivision is, that it's, it's humility versus hubris. And the more we can inch closer to,\n00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:00,800\n\nyou know, God created, if you will, and otherness so that we would dedicate our lives to a union with\n00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:08,320\n\neach other. Thank you. You know, I just want to say that question you posed so beautifully is,\n00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:15,200\n\nit's a question that weighs on me. I think so many people are carrying that question around right now\n00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,120\n\nand feeling pretty hopeless about it. I mean, it's, it's an open question and, and I, well,\n00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:28,880\n\nwe're resisting the divide. We're resisting the divide, but we don't know how to do it.\n00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,160\n\nRight. We privileged. Right. Not even, you know, the idea that you should, we should create\n00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,200\n\ncircles of inclusion is we don't, we're, we live so separately that we don't know,\n00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,560\n\nwe don't know how to start those relationships, but I, I don't know. I think one thing we're,\n00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:50,640\n\nwe're not very, we're not trained to do is I love Rilke's idea about holding the questions,\n00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,480\n\nliving the questions until one day you live into an answer. And so I think when we don't have the\n00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:04,160\n\nanswer immediately before us, we then despair. And I wonder if part of our work now is to hold\n00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:10,800\n\nthat question and to pose it with each other. And then, you know, then in that way, maybe we become\n00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,760\n\nlisteners together and we start to pieces. Wonderful. Thank you. Oh, over here. Sorry.\n00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:28,800\n\nI was wondering what in your ministry is your relationship with the local law enforcement\n00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:36,240\n\nand assuming that you have some relationship with them and that there is a,\n00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:41,760\n\na message within the community of not snitching, how do you deal with that?\n00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,880\n\nWell, you know, I've been doing this for 25 years and the first 10 years was,\n00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,880\n\nwas really hard and mainly because of law enforcement, but you know,\n00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,560\n\nbut it was really filled with death threats, bomb threats, hate mail, and, and not from gang members\n00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:02,080\n\nbecause we were always a symbol of hope. But, but I think the demonizing was so complete,\n00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,880\n\nespecially in terms of law enforcement that the friend of our enemy is our enemy as the middle\n00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,280\n\nEastern dictum goes. So if you demonize gang members, it was a short hop to demonize me.\n00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,280\n\nAnd that certainly was part of the air I breathed in my first 10 years. In fact, my first day as\n00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,760\n\npastor, I was sitting at my desk and waiting for people to come by, you know, and nobody did. And\n00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,960\n\nI thought, well, this is crazy. So I started to walk in the projects. Again, this was quite a\n00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,360\n\nchallenged area. And, and the, and the cops pulled me over. They pulled over and said,\n00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:39,920\n\nwhat are you doing here? Because I was a white guy walking in the projects, you know, and,\n00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,080\n\nand I said, well, I'm the new pastor. And I said, well, what are you doing? And I said, well,\n00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,440\n\nI'm walking in my parish. And the cop said, we don't recommend it. So I'm glad I didn't listen\n00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:58,000\n\nto him. But I, so it was antagonistic at first, I guess it's better. But it's, you know, demonizing\n00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:05,520\n\nis not just morally bankrupt, it's always false. It's never the truth. There are no demons, there\n00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:11,760\n\nare no monsters. That's how you know you're off track is when you when you're in that position\n00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,040\n\nto demonize and, and so that's gotten better. You know, I think we've gone from tough on crime to\n00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:23,600\n\nsmart on crime to having a high degree of reverence for how complex this issue is, you know. So it's\n00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:35,200\n\ngotten better and incrementally so over 25 years. I grew up in the city and was homeschooled because\n00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:44,560\n\nmy parents fear for my safety. And I go to suburban church and they don't touch the city because of\n00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:50,240\n\ntheir fear. And how do you combat the fear of love and compassion? Thank you for your question.\n00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:57,760\n\nYou know, I read once that, you know, the Beatitudes was the original language was not\n00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:07,680\n\nblessed are happy are the single hearted or those who work for peace or struggle for justice,\n00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,960\n\nthat the more precise translation is you're in the right place if.\n00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,040\n\nAnd I like that better, you know, because it turns out the Beatitudes is not a spirituality,\n00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:23,920\n\nit's a geography, you know, it tells you where to stand. You're in the right place if you're over\n00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,400\n\nhere. So you know, I come from Hollywood where we say location, location, location. And that really\n00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:35,200\n\nsort of addresses the earlier oi ve question, you know, that that it's about location, you really\n00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:41,200\n\nhave to go out. But knowing that service is the hallway that leads to the ballroom, you know,\n00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,960\n\nyou don't want to have service be the to be the end services, the hallway, it's the beginning,\n00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:54,880\n\nit's getting you to the ballroom, which is the place of kinship, the place of mutuality,\n00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,960\n\nthat place that everybody knows here, when you go there, you go who is receiving from whom,\n00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,760\n\nwho's the service provider, who's the service recipient, everybody knows what that experience is.\n00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:13,120\n\nYou know, you hear yourself say that, I know I'm here at the soup kitchen, but my God,\n00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:18,400\n\nI'm getting more from this, you know, everybody knows this. But it doesn't happen unless you\n00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,840\n\nbreak out, you know, and fear is, is just fueled by ignorance. And, and, and, and so you have to\n00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:31,440\n\nbreak out of our ignorance, we have to go to the place that frightens us, you know, and, and I'm\n00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:38,560\n\nalways admiring of employers, especially in the early days, before we were kind of established,\n00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:43,920\n\nwho would call us and I'd give a talk somewhere and, and then employer would call me and say,\n00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,480\n\nokay, send me somebody, I'm scared, though. I said, I get it. And then they'll love who they get,\n00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:57,200\n\nyou know, some homie who's enormously eager and a good worker, and then he'll call and say, send me\n00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,480\n\nsomebody else like him too, you know, and, but they had to take that, you know, look before you leap,\n00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:09,440\n\nbut leap. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate your personal stories, the interaction you have, but the young\n00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:19,600\n\nman on the steps and the like, but so many in the area where I come from, the way you deal with gangs\n00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:24,800\n\nis you incarcerate them. And so how much of the interaction have you had with the justice system,\n00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:30,720\n\nthe penal system, and how can we in communities that want to put these things and depersonalize\n00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:38,400\n\nthem away, can we do can be done societally, congregationally, personally? You know, I don't\n00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:46,400\n\nspend a lot of time in courts anymore, except that I always go as a, I will always testify when asked,\n00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,560\n\nand I'm asked a lot in death penalty sentencing cases where there's a gang member and I'm called\n00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:58,320\n\nin as a gang expert because I oppose the death penalty. But, but I've never encountered, I've\n00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:05,760\n\nprobably done 50 of these across the country. I've never encountered somebody, a gang member who's on\n00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,520\n\nthe stand, a defendant who in my estimation was not mentally ill. I don't think once. So at the\n00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:20,800\n\nminute you start to hear the profile and they always give you the profile, you go, wow, this\n00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,360\n\nis a deeply disturbed mentally ill person. No one wants you to say that the prosecution refuses you\n00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:32,240\n\nto say anything like that. Even the defense is don't say anything like that. Why? Because then\n00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:38,080\n\nyou're forced to, in the face of somebody who's mentally ill, you can only have one response.\n00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:44,240\n\nAnd that's compassion. And this freaks us out because we go, what happens to responsibility?\n00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:50,320\n\nAnd he knew what he was doing and prosecutors always say to me, well, he could choose. I go,\n00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:57,600\n\ngosh, you know, not all choices are created equal. And a person's ability to choose is not created\n00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:04,320\n\nequal. I don't know. If we were more sensible, you know, at an early age, we'd be, you know,\n00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:12,720\n\nsomehow infusing kids with hope when they can't imagine their future and they're planning their\n00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,960\n\nfunerals or we'd heal kids who are so damaged that they can't see their way clear to transform\n00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:26,160\n\ntheir pain so they continue to transmit it or to deliver mental health services in a timely,\n00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:33,120\n\neffective, appropriate way. If we did those things, if as a society, we did those things,\n00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:41,280\n\nwe wouldn't be at the place we're at where we're, where somebody has done a horrendous thing. And\n00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,560\n\nall you need to look back on is the last few months in this country from, you know,\n00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:51,680\n\n17 year old in Ohio high school gunning down his classmates, you know, this is about a mental\n00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:59,200\n\nillness. This isn't about a bad kid. But we do that, you know, and it's sort of anachronism.\n00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:05,120\n\nIt's a little bit like Jesus healing the guy possessed of a demon. Well, truth is he has\n00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:12,240\n\nepilepsy and here's the medicine you take. But we're like that. Even in today's world,\n00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:18,240\n\nwe're so anachronistic. We just say, well, this is obviously a bad kid and he chose badly\n00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:24,160\n\nand he doesn't know the difference between right and wrong and he's possessed by the devil.\n00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:29,920\n\nAnd, and that's not very enlightened of us. I don't think.\n00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:35,200\n\nHello. I probably have 50 questions and it'll be interesting to see which one.\n00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,200\n\n49 of them.\n00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,560\n\nWhich one comes out? I teach in a community college on the West Coast and kind of similarly,\n00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:52,240\n\nI teach culinary arts. So I see a whole range of individuals and hear stories that would cripple\n00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:58,640\n\nmost of us, what people are dealing with. But I think one of my key questions for you is when I\n00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:04,960\n\nhear you use the word homie, could you define what that means to you? And, and before you answer that,\n01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:13,280\n\ngrowing up, hearing the word homeboy has connotations across society and they're not\n01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:22,320\n\npositive connotations. They're either very dumb. They're sort of like you think of someone who's\n01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:28,000\n\neither mindless and just sort of bumbling along or someone who is a caricature. And so\n01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:35,600\n\nas I listened to you, I sat there and I said, well, does homie mean friend to him,\n01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:41,840\n\nbut homie may not mean friend to other people or does homie mean son or,\n01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,880\n\nbut as you give these talks around the country, I think about\n01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:54,000\n\nwhat are other people taking away from that word versus what it is that that word means to you?\n01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:02,000\n\nYeah. You know, it's sometimes when I go to other parts of the country, I was on a radio show\n01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,360\n\nfrom Chicago where a caller came in, took quite exception to the word homeboy.\n01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:13,920\n\nYeah. You don't find that so much in Los Angeles and, and, and no thought went into this at all,\n01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,880\n\nyou know, that, you know, I'm with a movie producer, I'm trying to get money out of them\n01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,680\n\nand he says, what do you think I should do? And, and he had proposed a lot of ideas and I said,\n01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,000\n\nwell, I don't know. Why don't you buy this old abandoned bakery across the street?\n01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,360\n\nWe'll call it homeboy bakery. That's how much thought went into this. So I wasn't,\n01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:37,360\n\nI wasn't kind of measuring and calculating. We'll just have, but in the end I'm okay with it\n01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:42,480\n\nbecause it's sort of like walking in a door and coming out another door. You'll hear homeboys say,\n01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,600\n\nyou know, Hey, do you know Mr. Sanchez? You know, he's my math teacher. I said, no, I don't.\n01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,520\n\nThat's the homie right there. It's a way of connecting. It's in part, in the end,\n01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,240\n\nit's a word that is soaked with kinship. It's about once it's about connection.\n01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,600\n\nYou know, and if mother Teresa says the problem in the world is that we've just forgotten that we\n01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:10,880\n\nbelong to each other. There's the potential anyway, I think for the word homeboy and homegirl to kind\n01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,880\n\nof say we're connected. It's a way of saying we belong to each other and it doesn't have to do with\n01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:23,440\n\nhe's in my gang and he isn't. And that's why the homeboy community and home, homegirls as well\n01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:31,600\n\nare, are, are folks who experience this connection and sense of belonging with each other.\n01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:38,240\n\nI'm particularly impressed with your using the words walking in the lowly places. That's where\n01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,360\n\nJesus would stand. But the question I have is you also talk about the prophetic and the hilarious.\n01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:54,080\n\nAnd I recall that if you look at the Dalai Lama, Thomas Merton, many of them have this wonderful\n01:02:54,080 --> 01:03:01,280\n\nsense of joy and you seem to have this sense of humor. I often find that peacemakers,\n01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:07,440\n\npeacekeepers are so intense and the weight is so heavy that there's very little time for laughter.\n01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:15,360\n\nI would like to know how, how it comes that you had this wonderful spirit of joy or,\n01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:20,960\n\nor what I'd call healthy humor and could you explain a little bit how you got that?\n01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,600\n\nUm, it's like, I don't know who talked about it. Like a discussing humor is like dissecting a frog.\n01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:32,720\n\nYou can do it, but the frog dies in the process. So I don't know. I mean, again, it's about joy and\n01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:44,080\n\nthat my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete. And so the intensity is, uh, you know,\n01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:53,680\n\nI think you want to avoid it, you know, because it's, you want to have a light grasp on life,\n01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:01,040\n\nyou know, and then in the end it's, it's, it's precisely those kinds of moments that,\n01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:05,840\n\nthat teach you something. I mean, real quickly, one of my favorite recently was, uh, Diane Keaton\n01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:12,000\n\nshowed up for lunch at a homegirl cafe, the Oscar winning actress, Annie Hall and Godfather movies.\n01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,360\n\nAnd she's there with a regular guy who's there once a week and, and, uh, her waitress is Glenda\n01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:24,640\n\nand Glenda's a homegirl, been there, done that tattooed felon parolee. Um, she doesn't know who\n01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:31,040\n\nDiane Keaton is. And so she's taking her order and Diane Keaton says, well, what do you recommend?\n01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,800\n\nAnd Glenda rattles off the three platios that she really likes and Diane Keaton says,\n01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:39,840\n\noh, I'll have that second one. That one sounds good. And then it was suddenly at that moment\n01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:44,160\n\nthat something dawns on Glenda and she looks at Diane Keaton. She goes, wait a minute. I,\n01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:49,520\n\nI feel like I know you like, like maybe we've met somewhere and Diane Keaton decides to sort of\n01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:55,440\n\ndeflect it humbly and say, Oh gosh, I don't know. I suppose I have one of those faces, you know,\n01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,760\n\nthat people think they've seen before. And they Glenda goes, no, now I know we were locked up\n01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:07,120\n\ntogether. And aside from the fact that that story absolutely took my breath away when I heard it.\n01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:21,840\n\nAnd I don't believe we've had any further Diane Keaton sightings. Now that I think of it,\n01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,320\n\nthat in the end it's about something. It's about kinship. It's about Oscar winning actress,\n01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:32,480\n\nattitudinal waitress that you may be one. That that's the whole thing that God has created this\n01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:42,560\n\notherness so that you might bump into each other and find that that's your homies that you were\n01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:50,800\n\nlocked up together. Thank you. I have two things to say. One is, I have a comment response to the\n01:05:50,800 --> 01:06:09,440\n\nwoman who asked how can we bridge? And then I have a question and the bridging started for me\n01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:15,680\n\nwhen I saw my purpose in life as bigger than I imagined. And I am a strong, strong athlete.\n01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:24,400\n\nAnd I swim every day in Rochester, New York. They knocked this berm down and all the people can\n01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,320\n\ncome to the beach now. So that means that my private Cape Cod ended. And so all sorts of\n01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:37,760\n\npeople of different color diversity. And this one woman, this is just tiny compared to the amount of\n01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:46,400\n\nhundreds of people I talked to as I walk. And then I swim. And this one woman came coming to my spot\n01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:54,560\n\nat the beach and she didn't know that it was my spot. And I grew up in country clubs. So, you know,\n01:06:54,560 --> 01:07:01,040\n\nI had this entitled feeling of my free beach. So I said, okay, this is my spot. Why does she keep\n01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:06,560\n\ncoming here? And she is covered with tattoos, huge body of those extraordinary tattoos I've ever seen.\n01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:14,880\n\nAnd I am afraid of needles. And so I look at tattoos, my whole body kind of breaks out into a\n01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:24,080\n\nsweat. I could jump out of an airplane in a parachute, but tattoos are not okay for me. So\n01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:31,200\n\nI decided the next day to push past my fear and talk to her. And it started this avocation of\n01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:39,760\n\nmine, just to talk to people I'm afraid of. And I started talking to her and we discussed her tattoos\n01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:45,680\n\nand then all of a sudden this light went off in my head. And I said, you know, I've been to Bali\n01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,640\n\nand I know people who stick swords into themselves. And I've watched the trans dancers and I'm an\n01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:56,880\n\nartist and I understand all this. And my head got so huge and she calmed so much. And she felt so\n01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:05,520\n\nloved with these magnificent tattoos all over her body that she ended up asking me for my email\n01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:12,560\n\naddress so we could stay friends. And my sense is that that fear is everything you're saying. It's\n01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:22,800\n\nit's this invented wall because of my phobias or invented decisions that I own something\n01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:32,480\n\nand that they aren't equal to me. So that piece I wanted to respond to the oivé that we really\n01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:39,440\n\nare in community. But my question was, what is more important than death? You said there are more\n01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:47,680\n\nimportant things than death when you talked about a perspective. What are they to you?\n01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:52,720\n\nWhat you just described is more powerful, not more important, more powerful than death. That\n01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:59,120\n\nencounter, the invasion of your beach, that encounter with the other is more powerful than\n01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:09,200\n\ndeath. I believe that with all my heart. We need to finish a very quick question.\n01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:18,880\n\nDid we miss him over here? Oh, well, I think we've got to finish. Maybe we can do these last two.\n01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:25,040\n\nYeah, they've told us we have to be out here for 2 15, 3 15. Yeah, we have seven minutes.\n01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:31,120\n\nI'll hurry. But I'm on LA time. So let's take both questions quickly. And then if it's true that\n01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:39,520\n\nyoung people and gangs are hypersensitive to and quick to respond to perceived words or actions of\n01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,440\n\ndisrespect, can you describe how you facilitate or how they make the transition to being able to\n01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:52,560\n\nwork side by side and cooperatively? Are there rules that you give to gang habits, for lack of\n01:09:52,560 --> 01:10:00,000\n\na better term? And if so, how do you enforce them? How do you help? Well, I mean, at Homeboy Industries,\n01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,960\n\nyou know, we're not there for those who need help, we're only for those who want it. So you have to\n01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,640\n\nwalk in the door in the same way a drug addict will walk into a drug rehab center. So that's the\n01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:14,480\n\nbaseline. And then common interest, you know, they all want to be able to pay their rent and their mom\n01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:20,000\n\nto be proud of them and their kids to not be ashamed of them. So Richard Rohrer always says that men\n01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,760\n\nwork things out, women work things out face to face, but men work things out shoulder to shoulder.\n01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,920\n\nAnd I think it's true. And I observed that, you know, they don't talk it out. Guys don't talk it\n01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,720\n\nout. Women do. They'll say remember that time that we threw down and they kind of rehash stuff.\n01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:43,520\n\nGuys don't do that. At least the gang members that work for me. But pretty soon, they, there's\n01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:50,480\n\nsomething that happens by osmosis and it just always happens. Are there any exceptions when\n01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:55,120\n\nthat doesn't happen? No. No. Okay. Thanks. Kind of a two-point question. Would you be\n01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:02,720\n\nso kind to comment on the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the prison system? And secondly,\n01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:08,560\n\nno, you don't have time for that. I'm sorry. No, that's okay. It's not effective. Yes. What's the next one?\n01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:14,480\n\nIt has to do with relative to recidivism. Gentlemen that get involved in your program,\n01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:24,160\n\ndo you find that many of them return to their formal way of life? Yeah. We have a UCLA researcher\n01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:30,000\n\nwho's completed three years of a five-year longitudinal evaluation. And across the country,\n01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,920\n\na program that's comparable, if there's a program comparable to this, the federal government deems\n01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,320\n\nyou an effective program if you have what they call a 30% retention rate, which is to say 30% of\n01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:46,960\n\nyour clients, people you work with, don't return to prison. And we've turned that on its head. I'm\n01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:52,240\n\nhappy to say that we have a 70%, 75%. And I think the reason is that it's relational, that in the end\n01:11:52,240 --> 01:12:03,200\n\nthere's nothing sterile about it. It's connective. It's a sense of belonging and all that stuff I\n01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:08,720\n\ntold you about community, Trump and gang. But the truth is, especially in California, if we do not\n01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:14,720\n\nprepare inmates for anything and nothing awaits them when they come out, then we've lost our right\n01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:20,800\n\nto be surprised that at least in California, we have the highest recidivism rate in the country.\n01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:26,640\n\nSo it's sensible to prepare stuff for them and even more thrilling and appropriate and of the\n01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:36,080\n\ngospel to welcome them when they come out and hire them at least. Thank you. We're not done yet.\n01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:44,320\n\nWe're not done yet. We're not done yet because I want to turn this into a radio show and it has\n01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:50,640\n\nto have an ending. It doesn't have an ending yet. I want to do my radio thing, which I forgot. I'm\n01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,480\n\nKrista, I'm Krista Tippett and this is on being today in the Hall of Philosophy at the Chautauqua\n01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:02,320\n\nInstitution with father Greg Boyle, the founder of one of the largest gang intervention programs\n01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:07,760\n\nin the country, Homeboy Industries. I just want to say as we close, you said at the beginning,\n01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:15,680\n\nand I pushed back and said how hard that is that the job is to be who God is in the world.\n01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:20,480\n\nAs you tell these stories of this life you lead, you know, you told this story in your book about\n01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:27,200\n\nhow when you touched on this a minute ago, you first arrived in the neighborhood and you\n01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,680\n\nexpected people to come to you and you would walk around and that didn't work. It was when you\n01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:35,840\n\nstarted visiting people when they were in hospital or visiting people when they were in prison\n01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,800\n\nthat they then acknowledged you as a member of the community. That's so resonant with that\n01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:46,080\n\nbeautiful passage in Matthew, Matthew 25 about, you know, but where, you know, God saying you\n01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:53,120\n\nweren't there when I visited you or you clothed me. You were there when I, you visited me when\n01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,840\n\nI sick, you clothed me, you fed me and they said when was that? When you fed, clothed, visited the\n01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:03,840\n\nleast of these. So I think it's so, it's wonderful how you show that that is doable,\n01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:09,280\n\nincarnating this incarnational message at the heart of Christianity. And you probably are\n01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,800\n\ntoo humble to want to take that in. Oh, thank you for that. But I also feel like in the end, you know,\n01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:24,720\n\nit is about imitating the kind of trying to imitate the kind of God you believe in and,\n01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:29,600\n\nand, and it's natural for us to push back on that. But the truth is, you know,\n01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,440\n\nwe're so used to a God, a one false move God. And, and so we're not really accustomed to the no\n01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:44,880\n\nmatter whatness of God, to the God who's just plain old, too busy loving us to be disappointed in us.\n01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:52,400\n\nAnd that is, I think the hardest thing to believe, but everybody in this space knows it's the truest\n01:14:52,400 --> 01:15:01,120\n\nthing you can say about God. I wondered if in closing you would read this little poem by the\n01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:08,240\n\n14th century Persian poet Hafez and why you put that in your book and the fact that it's from the\n01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:15,600\n\n14th century I love because it reminds us that we've always been this way as human beings.\n01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:21,760\n\nYeah, I don't know why I put it in my book.\n01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,880\n\n[laughter]\n01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:30,320\n\nUm, and so now I'm living my nightmare of my interview with Christa Tippett.\n01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,960\n\n[laughter]\n01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,520\n\nNow proven myself shallow and uninteresting. Anyway, it's called with that moon language,\n01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:44,160\n\nadmit something. Everyone you see, you say to them, love me. Of course you do not do this out loud,\n01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:52,240\n\notherwise someone would call the cops. Still though, think about this, this great pull in us\n01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:58,880\n\nto connect. Why not become the one who lives with the full moon in each eye that is always saying\n01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:06,720\n\nwith that sweet moon language what every other eye in this world is dying to hear?\n01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:13,520\n\nThank you, Greg Foyle.\n01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,520\n\n[applause]\n01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:42,880\n\nDon't forget that you can sign up for Chautauqua Dialogues over on the corner in front of the Hall\n01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:48,400\n\nof Missions and also purchase Father Greg's...\n01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,000\n\n[music]\n01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,080\n\n[music]\n01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:57,200\n\n",

He emphasizes the importance of kinship and finding joy and learning in relationships with others, particularly with the homies he works with. \n\n2. **The Concept of Mutuality in Relationships**: Time Frame [00:10:00,640] - [00:10:07,040]\n   - Boyle explains that his relationship with the homies is not about being a healer but about mutual learning and growth.

      "content": "Certainly! Here are a few quotations from the transcript where Father Greg Boyle discusses the idea of doing good work or positive actions because of relationship and love:\n\n1. **On the Motivation for Working with Homies:**\n   - \"I think it's right to see it as a duty because you have to be absolutely conscious of it. But it's really a delighting that enters into full kinship with each other, that the idea is to how do we find ways to luxuriate in mutuality.\"\n   - \"I'm not the great healer and that gang member over there is in need of my exquisite healing. The truth is, it's mutual.\"\n\n2. **On the Impact of Relationships:**\n   - \"It's about walking with Jesus and being a companion. And, and I haven't found anything that's brought me more life or joy than standing with Jesus, but also with the particularity of standing in, in the lowly place with the easily despised and the readily left out and with the demonized so that the demonizing will stop and with the disposable so that the day will come when we stop throwing people away. That gives me life.\"\n\n3. **On Kinship and Connection:**\n   - \"You mean, like analyze this. And he referenced that, that movie with Billy Crystal and Robert DeNiro. And then I started hearing that. And that you talk about a tipping point where suddenly it was okay for people to be in therapy. And, and so I don't sense any kind of stigma, which is really healthy and wonderful, because they have a lot of work to do. They've, they've been through a lot.\"\n\n4. **On the Transformation Through Relationships:**\n   - \"But suddenly kinship so quickly, you know, you're not sort of this delivery system, you know, but maybe I return him to himself, but there is no doubt that he's returned me to myself.\"\n\n5. **On the Essence of His Approach:**\n   - \"I'm big on mantra. So, so when I'm walking or, I always, before a kid comes into my office, I always say now hear this, now hear this, so that I'll be present right here to the person in front of me.\"\n\nThese quotes capture the essence of Boyle's approach: fostering kinship and mutual understanding rather than simply providing services or help. He emphasizes the importance of relationship-building and mutual transformation in the work he does with gang members.",

We would use funds to purchase a computer, music recording/production supplies, and art supplies and prepare the space.\nDescribe a second way you would use the support received *\nWe would use the funds to reduce our dependence on intermittent electricity from the government as well as the polluting generator we currently use by purchasing solar panels and a battery system to cover the gaps in our electricity service with less environmental impact.\nPlease use the maximum of 50 words or less. You have 50 words remaining.\nAdditional questions\nDescribe the issue(s) your project aims to address. Why is your project necessary? *\nFor the last 71 years the Palestinian refugees still live in camps in Beirut. What will happen to all the Syrian migrants to Lebanon?  What examples can we create to demonstrate a different way of interacting with guests? \nOur home explores responding to a crisis with hospitality and we create experiences and media for people to feel the realities of this approach. \nOur community consists of people who are creators of aid programming as well as recipients of aid. The cofounders (Saleh and Bilal) met in a program in the Palestinian Burj Al Barajne refugee camps. While that program had a positive impact, in the end the total environment around both the trainers and the trainees remains the same at the end of the day. As a facilitator in those programs I remember feeling helpless recognizing that my work was a drop in the bucket for the participants who were quickly becoming my friends. So when a participant (Saleh) proposed a project together, I jumped on the opportunity.\nBeit Al Atlas demonstrates and sparks a conversation around migration and shifting the conversation away from generosity: \"Support the poor refugees\" towards hospitality: \"Welcome to our home, we're having foul for dinner!\". There is beauty in difference and so much we can learn and gain from each other if only we stretch across the initial fear of the new. Our house is an example that it can be done and we're creating templates through our facilitation guides that can be used for others.\nFrom Avery:\nBeit al Atlas is committed to addressing issues of societal divisions and sustainable living. In Lebanon, sectarian and socioeconomic schisms divide neighborhoods and influence which school a family sends their children to. The country's poor electricity and water infrastructure, as well as the lack of public spaces, are often accepted as a result of a corrupt government and a lack of natural resources. In line with SDG 11, our project aims to heal societal divisions and promote sustainable urban living. By fostering a diverse and inclusive community space, taboo issues of religion, politics, and family are frequently opened up for conversation and artistic expression. Lasting friendships have been forged, and every interaction is a step towards deescalating social tensions in Beirut. Sustainable urban life is also promoted through co-living, partnerships with local farmers, water conservation education, a community rooftop garden, and up-cycling and waste reduction initiatives.\nPlease use the maximum of 250 words or less. You have 250 words remaining.\nWhy should your organization be selected as a finalist of this call for applications? *\nWe are sincere, we have been doing this work for 5 years and have grown slowly, organically and I believe we are in a good position to grow more confidently, share our lessons and shine.\nSeeing the results of decades of programming by the UN and other multinational NGOs first hand in the refugee camps I think I believe the work we are doing is critical. The efforts they do in bringing in trainers, conducting a short workshop with little follow up doesn’t seem effective. Most students go to get the daily rate and food they offer. In fact many of my friends seek out these trainings as a type of “income” they can bring home to their families. There needs to be a deeper rooted effort, longer lasting. Paid trainers may have good intentions, yet they will leave after establishing connections with the participants.\n To me, this highlights the importance of facilitating dialogue and engaging in the whole community around the migrant population. And by connecting  celebrateing our differences while showcasing a model of a more permeable society. Our home and programming attempts to create a space where knowledge of the neighbors can take place, and where there is knowledge there is possibility for love. And where there's love - well, anything is possible.\nWe have been doing this work for five years, and the house has grown slowly, organically, yet steadily. As Lebanon struggles to emerge from simultaneous crises of governance, currency devaluation, COVID-19 pandemic, and constant security concerns, we are ready and able to help. \nOver the past five years, Beit al Atlas has succeeded at reframing the conversations of humanitarian aid and migration, creating a diverse community that is truly connected across differences.\nWe are applying for funding to rent and furnish a second apartment. As Lebanon struggles to emerge from simultaneous crises of governance, currency devaluation, COVID-19 pandemic, and constant security concerns, we are ready and able to help. A second space means more residents from near and far, furthering our mission as described in the application. Our mission has meaning beyond the superficial, and I hope you support it by supporting our application. Thank you\nIn the end, our project has succeeded at reframing the conversations of humanitarian aid and migration, creating a diverse community that is truly connected across differences. Your support will allow us to expand our capacity and continue building bridges.\n\n\n\nOLD friend CONTENT FOLLOWS:\nDescribe up to 5 main activities of your project and outcomes/expected outcomes.

I have always felt incredibly welcomed at Beit Al Atlas and I know how much of yourself you have put in it. At the same time, I know how far from reality such grant applications can be as they are often created by people who mainly work from their offices, thinking about numbers to make it easier to compare for themselves. Moreover, have a look again at the subject areas important to them and relevant to you. I see that “global citizenship” and “migration and integration” are clearly related to your work. Integrate those keywords where it makes sense. Another one might be “prevention of violent extremism”, which I personally hate to use, but it may apply to peaceful co-living and providing pathways to a dignifying living situation in a host society? Up to you. \nThat being sad, have a look again at their criteria. I still have a lot of question marks, notably in terms of\n-      Measurability: How many people live in Beit Al Atlas? How many have you positively impacted? How have you done that? That goes even beyond the residents in my view since you combine co-living with co-sharing in a rather fancy area of Beirut, next to its biggest university. And this is how you create a lot of value, with researchers, artists etc. passing by and inspiring each other.\n-       Sustainability & Replicability: As an outside reader, I want to be inspired and fall in love with your idea and there is a lot of potential for that. Lebanon and Jordan (and even Egypt) struggle with urban development, scarce resources and providing viable models in which both nationals and migrants (who may ultimately become locals) can peacefully co-exist and fulfil their aspirations. So your grassroots initiative has a lot to offer in that regards. Unfortunately, however, I read mainly about a couple of ideas (selling different products, refurbishing the house) that sound a bit scattered to me, so that I am not quite sure what your focus is at the moment. You are also giving the grant a lot of importance to finance infrastructure and classes. I get that, it is really important, but at the same time it takes the focus away from the dream you have and the strategic clarity. Ideally, you find a balance and mention only one tiny, yet impactful area that you would dedicate the grant to?\n \nThe rest should be in the comments. I hope they make sense, else do not hesitate to get back to me. Oh and one last thing. Make effective use of the quantity of words you have in each section to fully express the essence of Beit Al Atlas and what you guys (and gals) dream of.\nCheers,\nLouisa \n\n",
