philosophy, secularism, and modern identity\n   - Questions:\n     1. How might the concept of \"constitutive goods\" help us understand the difference between instrumental metrics and intrinsic meaning in social impact work?\n     2. What role does \"strong evaluation\" play in differentiating between \"have to\" and \"want to\" motivations in entrepreneurial contexts?\n     3. How does the \"social imaginary\" shape our understanding of what constitutes meaningful impact versus measurable outcomes?\n\n2. **Donna Haraway** (Feminist scholar, Science and Technology Studies)\n   - Field: Situated knowledge, cyborg theory, and feminist technoscience\n   - Questions:\n     1. How might \"situated knowledge\" offer an alternative to both pure objectivity and pure subjectivity in measuring social impact?\n     2. What would a \"cyborg\" perspective on social entrepreneurship look like—one that neither rejects nor fully embraces technological scaling?\n     3. How can we develop \"response-ability\" rather than \"responsibility\" in our approach to complex social and environmental challenges?\n\n3. **Ivan Illich** (Social critic, philosopher)\n   - Field: Critique of industrial society, convivial tools, and institutional critique\n   - Questions:\n     1. How might the distinction between \"convivial tools\" and \"industrial tools\" help us reimagine entrepreneurship education?\n     2. What would \"right relationship\" to scale look like in social enterprise, avoiding both gigantism and parochialism?\n     3. How can we distinguish between \"vernacular values\" and institutionalized values in our approaches to social change?\n\nThese maps and scholarly perspectives invite deeper exploration of the tensions evident in your documents: between metrics and meaning, between scaling up and showing up, between transformation and transaction. They suggest that the path forward may lie not in choosing sides but in developing a stereoscopic vision that integrates multiple ways of knowing and being.",

In social impact work, there's a crucial distinction between metrics that serve as instrumental indicators and the constitutive goods that give the work its meaning. When organizations focus exclusively on quantifiable outcomes—jobs created, income generated, people served—they risk subordinating constitutive goods like human dignity, authentic relationship, and moral development to instrumental reasoning.\n\nThe danger here is what I've called the \"primacy of instrumental reason,\" where efficiency and measurement become dominant to the point that they override the qualitative distinctions that give our activities meaning. Social impact work contains constitutive goods—things valued for their own sake—such as human flourishing, dignity, and relationship. When these become mere means to achieving measurable outcomes, we've inverted the proper order of valuation.\n\nWhat the documents describe as the distinction between \"have to\" and \"want to\" tasks reflects this tension. Instrumental metrics belong to the realm of \"have to\"—they represent external validation and control. Constitutive goods belong to the realm of \"want to\"—they represent internal alignment with what we find meaningful. A healthy social impact organization would ensure that its metrics serve its constitutive goods, not the reverse.\n\n### Q2: What role does \"strong evaluation\" play in differentiating between \"have to\" and \"want to\" motivations in entrepreneurial contexts?\n\n**Taylor**: Strong evaluation involves qualitative distinctions of worth—judgments about what is higher and lower, noble and base, profound and superficial. This differs from weak evaluation, which merely weighs desires against one another based on outcomes or consequences.\n\nIn entrepreneurial contexts, \"have to\" motivations often emerge from weak evaluation: \"I have to create this business plan to get funding.\" \"I have to achieve these metrics to impress investors.\" These are instrumental calculations about consequences, not reflections on the intrinsic value of the activities.\n\n\"Want to\" motivations, by contrast, typically involve strong evaluation: \"I want to pursue this path because it allows me to express values I deeply hold.\" \"I want to build this enterprise because it embodies a form of relationship I believe is worthy.\" Here, the entrepreneur is making qualitative distinctions between ways of being in the world.\n\nWhat's missing in many entrepreneurship programs is precisely this capacity for strong evaluation. By teaching primarily instrumental skills without fostering reflection on constitutive goods, we develop entrepreneurs who can execute business models but may lack a strong sense of why their work matters beyond financial outcomes. This explains the recurring theme in the documents of people feeling disconnected from meaning despite achieving conventional metrics of success.\n\n### Q3: How does the \"social imaginary\" shape our understanding of what constitutes meaningful impact versus measurable outcomes?\n\n**Taylor**: The social imaginary—our collective understanding of how we fit together in society—profoundly shapes what we consider meaningful impact. Modern Western social imaginaries have increasingly privileged quantifiable, generalizable knowledge over contextual, embodied understanding. This isn't merely a theoretical preference but shapes our entire sense of what constitutes \"real\" impact.\n\nConsider how we've come to imagine social progress primarily through graphs pointing upward, statistics improving, and quantifiable \"return on investment.\" This isn't natural or inevitable—it's a particular social imaginary that emerged with modern capitalism, bureaucratic rationality, and scientific management.\n\nWhat the documents describe as \"stereoscopic vision\"—using both the quantitative and qualitative eye—represents an attempt to integrate different social imaginaries. One imaginary privileges measurement, scale, and generalizability; the other privileges relationship, particularity, and embodied knowledge. Neither is complete on its own.\n\nTransforming social impact work requires transforming our social imaginaries. This means challenging the dominance of quantification and developing new ways of articulating and legitimizing qualitative forms of knowledge and impact. Until our social imaginaries expand to include both modes of understanding, we'll continue seeing oscillation between metric-centered and meaning-centered approaches rather than their integration.\n\n## Donna Haraway's Responses\n\n### Q1: How might \"situated knowledge\" offer an alternative to both pure objectivity and pure subjectivity in measuring social impact?\n\n**Haraway**: Situated knowledge offers an alternative to the false choice between the \"god trick\" of perfect objectivity and the relativism of pure subjectivity. It recognizes that all knowledge is produced from somewhere—from particular bodies in particular contexts with particular perspectives. This doesn't make knowledge less reliable; it makes it more honest and accountable.\n\nIn measuring social impact, situated knowledge means acknowledging the position from which we measure. When organizations claim to objectively measure their impact through universal metrics, they're performing what I call the \"god trick\"—pretending to see everything from nowhere. Conversely, when practitioners reject measurement entirely in favor of purely subjective impressions, they lose the capacity for critical comparison and accountability.\n\nThe documents describe a tension between external metrics and internal meaning. Situated knowledge transcends this binary by recognizing that meaningful measurement must be rooted in specific contexts, communities, and embodied realities. It asks: Who is measuring? For whom? From what position? With what consequences?\n\nThis approach would lead to more diverse, context-sensitive measurement practices that remain rigorous without claiming universal authority. It would produce what I call \"partial, locatable, critical knowledges\" about impact—knowledge that acknowledges its perspective but remains committed to shared standards of evidence and reasoning.\n\n### Q2: What would a \"cyborg\" perspective on social entrepreneurship look like—one that neither rejects nor fully embraces technological scaling?\n\n**Haraway**: A cyborg perspective rejects pure categories and embraces productive hybridity. It doesn't pit technology against humanity, scale against intimacy, or global against local. Instead, it explores the generative possibilities of their recombination.\n\nFor social entrepreneurship, a cyborg perspective would reject both technophilia (the uncritical embrace of scaling, automation, and technological solutions) and technophobia (the romantic return to purely local, artisanal, or \"natural\" approaches). It would instead ask how technologies might serve relationship, how scale might enhance rather than diminish quality, and how global connections might strengthen rather than weaken local communities.\n\nThe documents reveal a tension between \"building a platform\" and \"being present in relationship.\" A cyborg approach wouldn't choose between these but would explore how platforms might enable rather than replace presence, how technology might enhance rather than diminish human connection.\n\nThis means designing technologies and scales that amplify human agency rather than diminish it—what the documents call technology \"within arm's reach.\" A cyborg social entrepreneurship would be neither addicted to scale nor allergic to it, but would develop what I call \"response-ability\"—the capacity to respond creatively to both technological possibilities and human needs.\n\n### Q3: How can we develop \"response-ability\" rather than \"responsibility\" in our approach to complex social and environmental challenges?\n\n**Haraway**: Response-ability differs from conventional responsibility. Responsibility often presumes mastery—the capacity to control outcomes and be held accountable for them. Response-ability, by contrast, acknowledges our embeddedness in complex systems where perfect control is impossible. It focuses on cultivating the capacity to respond thoughtfully within these entanglements.\n\nFor social impact work, this shift from responsibility to response-ability means moving beyond both savior complexes (\"we must fix the world\") and nihilism (\"nothing we do matters\"). Instead, it means developing the capacity to stay present with difficult realities, to notice patterns of harm and possibility, and to respond from where we are without claiming complete knowledge or control.\n\nThe documents describe this tension between \"saving the world\" and \"being saved by the world.\" Response-ability avoids this binary by recognizing our mutual interdependence with the systems we seek to change. We are neither separate saviors nor passive recipients, but participants in complex ecological, social, and technological networks.\n\nPractically, this means designing interventions that enhance the response-ability of all participants rather than concentrating responsibility in experts or leaders. It means creating feedback systems that help communities notice patterns and respond to them rather than imposing predetermined solutions. And it means staying with the trouble rather than demanding clean, quantifiable outcomes that may oversimplify complex realities.\n\n## Ivan Illich's Responses\n\n### Q1: How might the distinction between \"convivial tools\" and \"industrial tools\" help us reimagine entrepreneurship education?\n\n**Illich**: Convivial tools expand human autonomy and creativity; industrial tools turn people into mere operators or consumers. This distinction can completely transform how we conceive of entrepreneurship education.\n\nCurrent entrepreneurship education largely teaches people to create or operate industrial tools—businesses that scale by standardizing, automating, and ultimately controlling both producers and consumers. Even \"social entrepreneurship\" often follows this pattern, merely directing industrial tools toward social outcomes.\n\nEntrepreneurship education reimagined through conviviality would teach people to create tools that enhance human capability and relationship rather than replace them. It would prioritize what the documents call \"crafting a garden\"—creating conditions for natural growth rather than forcing standardized outcomes.\n\nPractically, this would mean teaching entrepreneurs to ask different questions: Does this venture expand or contract human capability? Does it foster dependency or autonomy? Does it concentrate power or distribute it? Does it treat people as mere means (customers, employees, beneficiaries) or as ends in themselves?\n\nThe metrics would change accordingly. Rather than measuring primarily scale, efficiency, or standardization, we would measure conviviality—the degree to which a venture expands human freedom and relationship. This aligns with the documents' emphasis on creating space for \"surprise\" and emergence rather than predetermined outcomes.\n\n### Q2: What would \"right relationship\" to scale look like in social enterprise, avoiding both gigantism and parochialism?\n\n**Illich**: The question of scale isn't merely technical but fundamentally ethical. Every tool has natural thresholds beyond which it becomes destructive rather than constructive. I've called these thresholds \"radical monopolies\"—points at which tools become so dominant that they eliminate meaningful alternatives.\n\nFor social enterprise, right relationship to scale means recognizing and respecting these thresholds. It means growing to the point of optimal human benefit, but not beyond. This requires rejecting what I've called \"the institutionalization of needs\"—the process by which humans become dependent on institutional solutions rather than developing autonomous capacity.\n\nThe documents describe the difference between a small farmer who can see and mourn a cat killed by their machine versus an industrial farmer whose machines destroy unseen life. This illustrates my point exactly: beyond certain thresholds, we lose the capacity for relationship and responsibility. Right scale in social enterprise preserves these capacities.\n\nPractically, this means designing enterprises with built-in limits—what economists might call \"self-limiting growth.\" It means focusing on appropriate scale rather than maximum scale, asking not \"how big can we grow?\" but \"what size best serves our purpose without undermining it?\" Some ventures might need substantial scale to achieve their purpose; others might be most effective when they remain small and contextual.\n\n### Q3: How can we distinguish between \"vernacular values\" and institutionalized values in our approaches to social change?\n\n**Illich**: Vernacular values emerge from communities' lived experiences and direct relationships. They reflect what people find meaningful in their everyday lives and contexts. Institutionalized values, by contrast, are formalized, standardized, and often imposed from outside.\n\nIn social change work, this distinction helps us understand why many well-intended interventions fail. When outside institutions impose their values—even progressive ones like \"sustainability\" or \"empowerment\"—without engaging vernacular values, they often create dependency and resentment rather than meaningful change.\n\nThe documents describe the tension between instrumental values (what we do because we \"have to\") and constitutive values (what we do because we \"want to\"). This mirrors my distinction. Institutionalized values belong to the realm of \"have to\"—they represent external expectations and standards. Vernacular values belong to the realm of \"want to\"—they represent communities' own sense of what matters.\n\nRespecting vernacular values doesn't mean romanticizing the status quo or abandoning social change. It means engaging communities as subjects with their own valid perspectives rather than as objects of intervention. It means recognizing that meaningful change must speak to and through vernacular values rather than overriding them with institutional ones.\n\nThis requires genuine dialogue rather than one-way transfer of knowledge or values. As the documents suggest, it means creating space for \"surprise\"—for outcomes we couldn't predict because they emerge from communities' own values and contexts rather than our predetermined metrics.\n\n## Scholarly Responses and Critiques\n\n### Haraway responds to Taylor:\n\n**Haraway**: Charles offers valuable insights about constitutive goods and strong evaluation, but his framework remains somewhat abstract and universalist. While he acknowledges social imaginaries, he doesn't fully address how power shapes these imaginaries differently across contexts.\n\nFrom a situated knowledge perspective, we must ask: Whose constitutive goods? Defined through what power relations? The capacity for \"strong evaluation\" isn't equally distributed—it requires certain privileges of education, security, and social position that many entrepreneurs lack.\n\nTo expand Taylor's framework, we need to attend to how constitutive goods emerge within specific material and historical conditions, not just as abstract moral orientations. This would mean tracing how particular communities develop their own standards of meaning and worth, often in resistance to dominant frameworks.\n\nIn entrepreneurial contexts, this would involve mapping how different communities define success and meaning differently based on their histories, challenges, and aspirations—not assuming a universal framework of evaluation, even a qualitative one.\n\n### Illich responds to Taylor:\n\n**Illich**: Taylor provides profound insights into the qualitative distinctions that make life meaningful, but he insufficiently addresses how institutions systematically undermine these distinctions. It's not merely that we've lost our capacity for strong evaluation; it's that our institutions actively disable this capacity by monopolizing the definition of needs and solutions.\n\nThe social imaginaries Taylor describes don't just happen—they're engineered through what I call \"radical monopolies\" that institutionalize human needs and responses. Modern education, healthcare, transportation, and yes, entrepreneurship programs create institutionalized solutions that crowd out vernacular alternatives.\n\nTo expand Taylor's approach, we must move beyond diagnosing the problem to dismantling the institutional structures that perpetuate it. This means not just recovering our capacity for strong evaluation but creating spaces where this capacity can be exercised outside institutional control—what I call \"convivial reconstruction.\"\n\nFor social entrepreneurship, this would mean designing ventures that deliberately limit institutional power and enhance community autonomy. It would mean measuring success not by how many needs an enterprise addresses but by how effectively it enables communities to meet their own needs.\n\n### Taylor responds to Haraway:\n\n**Taylor**: Donna's situated knowledge offers a valuable corrective to abstract universalism, but risks fragmenting our moral landscape to the point where meaningful dialogue becomes difficult. If all knowledge is situated, how do we develop shared frameworks for evaluating social impact without falling into mere power struggles between competing perspectives?\n\nThe challenge is developing what I call \"cross-pressured\" understandings—frameworks that acknowledge their situatedness while remaining open to transcultural dialogue. Without this, we risk a form of moral particularism that undermines the possibility of shared evaluation.\n\nTo expand Haraway's approach, we need to explore how situated knowledges can engage in productive dialogue across differences without assuming either a universal standpoint or completely incommensurable frameworks. This means developing what I call \"language of perspicuous contrast\"—ways of articulating different situated knowledges that allow for meaningful comparison without erasing difference.\n\nFor measuring social impact, this would mean developing methods that explicitly locate their perspective while remaining open to dialogue with other frameworks—not claiming universal authority but also not abandoning the possibility of reasoned evaluation across contexts.\n\n### Illich responds to Haraway:\n\n**Illich**: Haraway's cyborg metaphor compellingly challenges pure categories, but understates the inherent biases built into technological systems. Technologies aren't neutral tools awaiting hybrid recombination—they embody specific values, often ones that undermine conviviality and autonomy.\n\nThe problem isn't just balancing technology and humanity but recognizing how technologies actively reshape human capacities and relationships, often in ways that reduce autonomy and conviviality. What I call \"tools for conviviality\" aren't merely hybrid combinations but technologies specifically designed to enhance human capability rather than replace it.\n\nTo expand Haraway's approach, we need more explicit normative criteria for evaluating technologies—not just embracing hybridity but asking what specific forms of hybridity enhance human autonomy and relationship. This means moving beyond the metaphor of the cyborg to concrete analysis of how specific technologies redistribute power and capability.\n\nFor social entrepreneurship, this would mean evaluating technologies not merely by their efficiency or scalability but by their effects on human capability and relationship. It would mean distinguishing between technologies that enhance conviviality and those that, however seductive, ultimately diminish it.\n\n### Taylor responds to Illich:\n\n**Taylor**: Ivan's critique of institutional power is penetrating, but risks a certain romanticism about pre-industrial or vernacular ways of life. While institutions can indeed disable our moral capacities, they also enable forms of coordination and solidarity that vernacular approaches alone cannot achieve.\n\nThe challenge is not eliminating institutions but transforming them to better support rather than undermine our constitutive goods. This requires what I call \"retrieval\"—recovering valuable aspects of pre-modern moral frameworks without abandoning the legitimate gains of modernity.\n\nTo expand Illich's approach, we need a more nuanced account of how institutions might be redesigned to support rather than undermine constitutive goods. This means not just critiquing institutional power but exploring how institutions might serve as vehicles for embodying shared moral understandings.\n\nFor social entrepreneurship, this would mean designing organizations that explicitly support constitutive goods rather than reducing everything to instrumental metrics. It would mean developing what I call \"practices\"—coherent, cooperative forms of activity organized around internal goods—rather than mere organizations oriented toward external outcomes.\n\n### Haraway responds to Illich:\n\n**Haraway**: Ivan's distinction between convivial and industrial tools offers powerful normative clarity, but risks reinstating precisely the pure categories that my cyborg metaphor challenges. The line between conviviality and control isn't always clear, and technologies often embody both possibilities simultaneously.\n\nThe challenge isn't choosing between convivial and industrial tools but developing what I call \"response-ability\"—the capacity to respond creatively to the specific affordances and dangers of particular technologies in particular contexts. This requires staying with the trouble rather than seeking pure solutions.\n\nTo expand Illich's approach, we need a more dynamic understanding of how tools evolve in relation to their users and contexts. Rather than categorizing tools as inherently convivial or industrial, we might explore how specific communities develop response-ability in relation to specific technologies—sometimes subverting their original purposes or creating unexpected hybrids.\n\nFor social entrepreneurship, this would mean less focus on designing perfectly convivial tools and more on cultivating communities' capacity to adapt, repurpose, and sometimes resist tools according to their own needs and values. It would mean measuring not just a tool's intrinsic properties but its evolving relationship with the communities that use it.\n\n## Consensus Discussion Paper\n\n# Beyond Metrics and Meaning: Toward Convivial and Situated Approaches to Social Impact\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis paper addresses a fundamental tension in social impact work between quantitative metrics and qualitative meaning. Drawing on Taylor's concept of constitutive goods, Haraway's notion of situated knowledge, and Illich's distinction between convivial and industrial tools, we propose an integrated framework that transcends the false binary between measurement and meaning. We argue that effective social impact requires both stereoscopic vision—the capacity to see through multiple frameworks simultaneously—and convivial design—the creation of tools and organizations that enhance human capability and relationship rather than replacing them. Through case studies from entrepreneurship education and social enterprise, we demonstrate how this integrated approach can transform both the practice and evaluation of social impact work.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSocial impact organizations increasingly find themselves torn between competing demands: the pressure to demonstrate quantifiable outcomes and the desire to maintain authentic connection to meaning and purpose. This tension manifests in numerous ways: the contrast between \"scaling up\" and \"showing up,\" between standardization and contextualization, between measuring impact and fostering transformation.\n\nRather than choosing sides in this tension, we propose an integrated approach drawing on three complementary theoretical frameworks:\n\n1. Charles Taylor's ethics of authenticity and constitutive goods\n2. Donna Haraway's situated knowledge and response-ability\n3. Ivan Illich's convivial tools and appropriate scale\n\nTogether, these frameworks help us understand social impact as neither purely objective nor purely subjective, but as a convivial practice situated in specific contexts while remaining open to broader dialogue about shared goods.\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Constitutive Goods and Strong Evaluation\n\nTaylor's concept of constitutive goods provides a framework for understanding what makes social impact meaningful beyond instrumental outcomes. Constitutive goods are those things we value not merely as means to other ends, but as intrinsically worthy in themselves. In social impact work, these might include human dignity, authentic relationship, community autonomy, or environmental harmony.\n\nStrong evaluation—making qualitative distinctions between higher and lower, worthy and unworthy—allows social impact practitioners to differentiate between merely instrumental \"have to\" motivations and more meaningful \"want to\" motivations that connect to constitutive goods. This distinction helps explain why organizations can achieve impressive metrics while still feeling disconnected from meaning and purpose.\n\n### Situated Knowledge and Response-ability\n\nHaraway's concept of situated knowledge provides an alternative to both the \"god trick\" of perfect objectivity and the relativism of pure subjectivity. It recognizes that all knowledge, including knowledge about social impact, is produced from somewhere—from particular bodies in particular contexts with particular perspectives.\n\nResponse-ability—the capacity to respond thoughtfully within complex systems where perfect control is impossible—helps social impact practitioners move beyond both savior complexes and nihilism. It focuses on cultivating the capacity to notice patterns of harm and possibility and to respond from where we are without claiming complete knowledge or control.\n\n### Convivial Tools and Appropriate Scale\n\nIllich's distinction between convivial tools (which expand human autonomy and creativity) and industrial tools (which turn people into mere operators or consumers) offers a framework for evaluating social impact interventions.

In social impact work, there's a crucial distinction between metrics that serve as instrumental indicators and the constitutive goods that give the work its meaning. When organizations focus exclusively on quantifiable outcomes—jobs created, income generated, people served—they risk subordinating constitutive goods like human dignity, authentic relationship, and moral development to instrumental reasoning.\n\nThe danger here is what I've called the \"primacy of instrumental reason,\" where efficiency and measurement become dominant to the point that they override the qualitative distinctions that give our activities meaning. Social impact work contains constitutive goods—things valued for their own sake—such as human flourishing, dignity, and relationship. When these become mere means to achieving measurable outcomes, we've inverted the proper order of valuation.\n\nWhat the documents describe as the distinction between \"have to\" and \"want to\" tasks reflects this tension. Instrumental metrics belong to the realm of \"have to\"—they represent external validation and control. Constitutive goods belong to the realm of \"want to\"—they represent internal alignment with what we find meaningful. A healthy social impact organization would ensure that its metrics serve its constitutive goods, not the reverse.\n\n### Q2: What role does \"strong evaluation\" play in differentiating between \"have to\" and \"want to\" motivations in entrepreneurial contexts?\n\n**Taylor**: Strong evaluation involves qualitative distinctions of worth—judgments about what is higher and lower, noble and base, profound and superficial. This differs from weak evaluation, which merely weighs desires against one another based on outcomes or consequences.\n\nIn entrepreneurial contexts, \"have to\" motivations often emerge from weak evaluation: \"I have to create this business plan to get funding.\" \"I have to achieve these metrics to impress investors.\" These are instrumental calculations about consequences, not reflections on the intrinsic value of the activities.\n\n\"Want to\" motivations, by contrast, typically involve strong evaluation: \"I want to pursue this path because it allows me to express values I deeply hold.\" \"I want to build this enterprise because it embodies a form of relationship I believe is worthy.\" Here, the entrepreneur is making qualitative distinctions between ways of being in the world.\n\nWhat's missing in many entrepreneurship programs is precisely this capacity for strong evaluation. By teaching primarily instrumental skills without fostering reflection on constitutive goods, we develop entrepreneurs who can execute business models but may lack a strong sense of why their work matters beyond financial outcomes. This explains the recurring theme in the documents of people feeling disconnected from meaning despite achieving conventional metrics of success.\n\n### Q3: How does the \"social imaginary\" shape our understanding of what constitutes meaningful impact versus measurable outcomes?\n\n**Taylor**: The social imaginary—our collective understanding of how we fit together in society—profoundly shapes what we consider meaningful impact. Modern Western social imaginaries have increasingly privileged quantifiable, generalizable knowledge over contextual, embodied understanding. This isn't merely a theoretical preference but shapes our entire sense of what constitutes \"real\" impact.\n\nConsider how we've come to imagine social progress primarily through graphs pointing upward, statistics improving, and quantifiable \"return on investment.\" This isn't natural or inevitable—it's a particular social imaginary that emerged with modern capitalism, bureaucratic rationality, and scientific management.\n\nWhat the documents describe as \"stereoscopic vision\"—using both the quantitative and qualitative eye—represents an attempt to integrate different social imaginaries. One imaginary privileges measurement, scale, and generalizability; the other privileges relationship, particularity, and embodied knowledge. Neither is complete on its own.\n\nTransforming social impact work requires transforming our social imaginaries. This means challenging the dominance of quantification and developing new ways of articulating and legitimizing qualitative forms of knowledge and impact. Until our social imaginaries expand to include both modes of understanding, we'll continue seeing oscillation between metric-centered and meaning-centered approaches rather than their integration.\n\n## Donna Haraway's Responses\n\n### Q1: How might \"situated knowledge\" offer an alternative to both pure objectivity and pure subjectivity in measuring social impact?\n\n**Haraway**: Situated knowledge offers an alternative to the false choice between the \"god trick\" of perfect objectivity and the relativism of pure subjectivity. It recognizes that all knowledge is produced from somewhere—from particular bodies in particular contexts with particular perspectives. This doesn't make knowledge less reliable; it makes it more honest and accountable.\n\nIn measuring social impact, situated knowledge means acknowledging the position from which we measure. When organizations claim to objectively measure their impact through universal metrics, they're performing what I call the \"god trick\"—pretending to see everything from nowhere. Conversely, when practitioners reject measurement entirely in favor of purely subjective impressions, they lose the capacity for critical comparison and accountability.\n\nThe documents describe a tension between external metrics and internal meaning. Situated knowledge transcends this binary by recognizing that meaningful measurement must be rooted in specific contexts, communities, and embodied realities. It asks: Who is measuring? For whom? From what position? With what consequences?\n\nThis approach would lead to more diverse, context-sensitive measurement practices that remain rigorous without claiming universal authority. It would produce what I call \"partial, locatable, critical knowledges\" about impact—knowledge that acknowledges its perspective but remains committed to shared standards of evidence and reasoning.\n\n### Q2: What would a \"cyborg\" perspective on social entrepreneurship look like—one that neither rejects nor fully embraces technological scaling?\n\n**Haraway**: A cyborg perspective rejects pure categories and embraces productive hybridity. It doesn't pit technology against humanity, scale against intimacy, or global against local. Instead, it explores the generative possibilities of their recombination.\n\nFor social entrepreneurship, a cyborg perspective would reject both technophilia (the uncritical embrace of scaling, automation, and technological solutions) and technophobia (the romantic return to purely local, artisanal, or \"natural\" approaches). It would instead ask how technologies might serve relationship, how scale might enhance rather than diminish quality, and how global connections might strengthen rather than weaken local communities.\n\nThe documents reveal a tension between \"building a platform\" and \"being present in relationship.\" A cyborg approach wouldn't choose between these but would explore how platforms might enable rather than replace presence, how technology might enhance rather than diminish human connection.\n\nThis means designing technologies and scales that amplify human agency rather than diminish it—what the documents call technology \"within arm's reach.\" A cyborg social entrepreneurship would be neither addicted to scale nor allergic to it, but would develop what I call \"response-ability\"—the capacity to respond creatively to both technological possibilities and human needs.\n\n### Q3: How can we develop \"response-ability\" rather than \"responsibility\" in our approach to complex social and environmental challenges?\n\n**Haraway**: Response-ability differs from conventional responsibility. Responsibility often presumes mastery—the capacity to control outcomes and be held accountable for them. Response-ability, by contrast, acknowledges our embeddedness in complex systems where perfect control is impossible. It focuses on cultivating the capacity to respond thoughtfully within these entanglements.\n\nFor social impact work, this shift from responsibility to response-ability means moving beyond both savior complexes (\"we must fix the world\") and nihilism (\"nothing we do matters\"). Instead, it means developing the capacity to stay present with difficult realities, to notice patterns of harm and possibility, and to respond from where we are without claiming complete knowledge or control.\n\nThe documents describe this tension between \"saving the world\" and \"being saved by the world.\" Response-ability avoids this binary by recognizing our mutual interdependence with the systems we seek to change. We are neither separate saviors nor passive recipients, but participants in complex ecological, social, and technological networks.\n\nPractically, this means designing interventions that enhance the response-ability of all participants rather than concentrating responsibility in experts or leaders. It means creating feedback systems that help communities notice patterns and respond to them rather than imposing predetermined solutions. And it means staying with the trouble rather than demanding clean, quantifiable outcomes that may oversimplify complex realities.\n\n## Ivan Illich's Responses\n\n### Q1: How might the distinction between \"convivial tools\" and \"industrial tools\" help us reimagine entrepreneurship education?\n\n**Illich**: Convivial tools expand human autonomy and creativity; industrial tools turn people into mere operators or consumers. This distinction can completely transform how we conceive of entrepreneurship education.\n\nCurrent entrepreneurship education largely teaches people to create or operate industrial tools—businesses that scale by standardizing, automating, and ultimately controlling both producers and consumers. Even \"social entrepreneurship\" often follows this pattern, merely directing industrial tools toward social outcomes.\n\nEntrepreneurship education reimagined through conviviality would teach people to create tools that enhance human capability and relationship rather than replace them. It would prioritize what the documents call \"crafting a garden\"—creating conditions for natural growth rather than forcing standardized outcomes.\n\nPractically, this would mean teaching entrepreneurs to ask different questions: Does this venture expand or contract human capability? Does it foster dependency or autonomy? Does it concentrate power or distribute it? Does it treat people as mere means (customers, employees, beneficiaries) or as ends in themselves?\n\nThe metrics would change accordingly. Rather than measuring primarily scale, efficiency, or standardization, we would measure conviviality—the degree to which a venture expands human freedom and relationship. This aligns with the documents' emphasis on creating space for \"surprise\" and emergence rather than predetermined outcomes.\n\n### Q2: What would \"right relationship\" to scale look like in social enterprise, avoiding both gigantism and parochialism?\n\n**Illich**: The question of scale isn't merely technical but fundamentally ethical. Every tool has natural thresholds beyond which it becomes destructive rather than constructive. I've called these thresholds \"radical monopolies\"—points at which tools become so dominant that they eliminate meaningful alternatives.\n\nFor social enterprise, right relationship to scale means recognizing and respecting these thresholds. It means growing to the point of optimal human benefit, but not beyond. This requires rejecting what I've called \"the institutionalization of needs\"—the process by which humans become dependent on institutional solutions rather than developing autonomous capacity.\n\nThe documents describe the difference between a small farmer who can see and mourn a cat killed by their machine versus an industrial farmer whose machines destroy unseen life. This illustrates my point exactly: beyond certain thresholds, we lose the capacity for relationship and responsibility. Right scale in social enterprise preserves these capacities.\n\nPractically, this means designing enterprises with built-in limits—what economists might call \"self-limiting growth.\" It means focusing on appropriate scale rather than maximum scale, asking not \"how big can we grow?\" but \"what size best serves our purpose without undermining it?\" Some ventures might need substantial scale to achieve their purpose; others might be most effective when they remain small and contextual.\n\n### Q3: How can we distinguish between \"vernacular values\" and institutionalized values in our approaches to social change?\n\n**Illich**: Vernacular values emerge from communities' lived experiences and direct relationships. They reflect what people find meaningful in their everyday lives and contexts. Institutionalized values, by contrast, are formalized, standardized, and often imposed from outside.\n\nIn social change work, this distinction helps us understand why many well-intended interventions fail. When outside institutions impose their values—even progressive ones like \"sustainability\" or \"empowerment\"—without engaging vernacular values, they often create dependency and resentment rather than meaningful change.\n\nThe documents describe the tension between instrumental values (what we do because we \"have to\") and constitutive values (what we do because we \"want to\"). This mirrors my distinction. Institutionalized values belong to the realm of \"have to\"—they represent external expectations and standards. Vernacular values belong to the realm of \"want to\"—they represent communities' own sense of what matters.\n\nRespecting vernacular values doesn't mean romanticizing the status quo or abandoning social change. It means engaging communities as subjects with their own valid perspectives rather than as objects of intervention. It means recognizing that meaningful change must speak to and through vernacular values rather than overriding them with institutional ones.\n\nThis requires genuine dialogue rather than one-way transfer of knowledge or values. As the documents suggest, it means creating space for \"surprise\"—for outcomes we couldn't predict because they emerge from communities' own values and contexts rather than our predetermined metrics.\n\n## Scholarly Responses and Critiques\n\n### Haraway responds to Taylor:\n\n**Haraway**: Charles offers valuable insights about constitutive goods and strong evaluation, but his framework remains somewhat abstract and universalist. While he acknowledges social imaginaries, he doesn't fully address how power shapes these imaginaries differently across contexts.\n\nFrom a situated knowledge perspective, we must ask: Whose constitutive goods? Defined through what power relations? The capacity for \"strong evaluation\" isn't equally distributed—it requires certain privileges of education, security, and social position that many entrepreneurs lack.\n\nTo expand Taylor's framework, we need to attend to how constitutive goods emerge within specific material and historical conditions, not just as abstract moral orientations. This would mean tracing how particular communities develop their own standards of meaning and worth, often in resistance to dominant frameworks.\n\nIn entrepreneurial contexts, this would involve mapping how different communities define success and meaning differently based on their histories, challenges, and aspirations—not assuming a universal framework of evaluation, even a qualitative one.\n\n### Illich responds to Taylor:\n\n**Illich**: Taylor provides profound insights into the qualitative distinctions that make life meaningful, but he insufficiently addresses how institutions systematically undermine these distinctions. It's not merely that we've lost our capacity for strong evaluation; it's that our institutions actively disable this capacity by monopolizing the definition of needs and solutions.\n\nThe social imaginaries Taylor describes don't just happen—they're engineered through what I call \"radical monopolies\" that institutionalize human needs and responses. Modern education, healthcare, transportation, and yes, entrepreneurship programs create institutionalized solutions that crowd out vernacular alternatives.\n\nTo expand Taylor's approach, we must move beyond diagnosing the problem to dismantling the institutional structures that perpetuate it. This means not just recovering our capacity for strong evaluation but creating spaces where this capacity can be exercised outside institutional control—what I call \"convivial reconstruction.\"\n\nFor social entrepreneurship, this would mean designing ventures that deliberately limit institutional power and enhance community autonomy. It would mean measuring success not by how many needs an enterprise addresses but by how effectively it enables communities to meet their own needs.\n\n### Taylor responds to Haraway:\n\n**Taylor**: Donna's situated knowledge offers a valuable corrective to abstract universalism, but risks fragmenting our moral landscape to the point where meaningful dialogue becomes difficult. If all knowledge is situated, how do we develop shared frameworks for evaluating social impact without falling into mere power struggles between competing perspectives?\n\nThe challenge is developing what I call \"cross-pressured\" understandings—frameworks that acknowledge their situatedness while remaining open to transcultural dialogue. Without this, we risk a form of moral particularism that undermines the possibility of shared evaluation.\n\nTo expand Haraway's approach, we need to explore how situated knowledges can engage in productive dialogue across differences without assuming either a universal standpoint or completely incommensurable frameworks. This means developing what I call \"language of perspicuous contrast\"—ways of articulating different situated knowledges that allow for meaningful comparison without erasing difference.\n\nFor measuring social impact, this would mean developing methods that explicitly locate their perspective while remaining open to dialogue with other frameworks—not claiming universal authority but also not abandoning the possibility of reasoned evaluation across contexts.\n\n### Illich responds to Haraway:\n\n**Illich**: Haraway's cyborg metaphor compellingly challenges pure categories, but understates the inherent biases built into technological systems. Technologies aren't neutral tools awaiting hybrid recombination—they embody specific values, often ones that undermine conviviality and autonomy.\n\nThe problem isn't just balancing technology and humanity but recognizing how technologies actively reshape human capacities and relationships, often in ways that reduce autonomy and conviviality. What I call \"tools for conviviality\" aren't merely hybrid combinations but technologies specifically designed to enhance human capability rather than replace it.\n\nTo expand Haraway's approach, we need more explicit normative criteria for evaluating technologies—not just embracing hybridity but asking what specific forms of hybridity enhance human autonomy and relationship. This means moving beyond the metaphor of the cyborg to concrete analysis of how specific technologies redistribute power and capability.\n\nFor social entrepreneurship, this would mean evaluating technologies not merely by their efficiency or scalability but by their effects on human capability and relationship. It would mean distinguishing between technologies that enhance conviviality and those that, however seductive, ultimately diminish it.\n\n### Taylor responds to Illich:\n\n**Taylor**: Ivan's critique of institutional power is penetrating, but risks a certain romanticism about pre-industrial or vernacular ways of life. While institutions can indeed disable our moral capacities, they also enable forms of coordination and solidarity that vernacular approaches alone cannot achieve.\n\nThe challenge is not eliminating institutions but transforming them to better support rather than undermine our constitutive goods. This requires what I call \"retrieval\"—recovering valuable aspects of pre-modern moral frameworks without abandoning the legitimate gains of modernity.\n\nTo expand Illich's approach, we need a more nuanced account of how institutions might be redesigned to support rather than undermine constitutive goods. This means not just critiquing institutional power but exploring how institutions might serve as vehicles for embodying shared moral understandings.\n\nFor social entrepreneurship, this would mean designing organizations that explicitly support constitutive goods rather than reducing everything to instrumental metrics. It would mean developing what I call \"practices\"—coherent, cooperative forms of activity organized around internal goods—rather than mere organizations oriented toward external outcomes.\n\n### Haraway responds to Illich:\n\n**Haraway**: Ivan's distinction between convivial and industrial tools offers powerful normative clarity, but risks reinstating precisely the pure categories that my cyborg metaphor challenges. The line between conviviality and control isn't always clear, and technologies often embody both possibilities simultaneously.\n\nThe challenge isn't choosing between convivial and industrial tools but developing what I call \"response-ability\"—the capacity to respond creatively to the specific affordances and dangers of particular technologies in particular contexts. This requires staying with the trouble rather than seeking pure solutions.\n\nTo expand Illich's approach, we need a more dynamic understanding of how tools evolve in relation to their users and contexts. Rather than categorizing tools as inherently convivial or industrial, we might explore how specific communities develop response-ability in relation to specific technologies—sometimes subverting their original purposes or creating unexpected hybrids.\n\nFor social entrepreneurship, this would mean less focus on designing perfectly convivial tools and more on cultivating communities' capacity to adapt, repurpose, and sometimes resist tools according to their own needs and values. It would mean measuring not just a tool's intrinsic properties but its evolving relationship with the communities that use it.\n\n## Consensus Discussion Paper\n\n# Beyond Metrics and Meaning: Toward Convivial and Situated Approaches to Social Impact\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis paper addresses a fundamental tension in social impact work between quantitative metrics and qualitative meaning. Drawing on Taylor's concept of constitutive goods, Haraway's notion of situated knowledge, and Illich's distinction between convivial and industrial tools, we propose an integrated framework that transcends the false binary between measurement and meaning. We argue that effective social impact requires both stereoscopic vision—the capacity to see through multiple frameworks simultaneously—and convivial design—the creation of tools and organizations that enhance human capability and relationship rather than replacing them. Through case studies from entrepreneurship education and social enterprise, we demonstrate how this integrated approach can transform both the practice and evaluation of social impact work.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSocial impact organizations increasingly find themselves torn between competing demands: the pressure to demonstrate quantifiable outcomes and the desire to maintain authentic connection to meaning and purpose. This tension manifests in numerous ways: the contrast between \"scaling up\" and \"showing up,\" between standardization and contextualization, between measuring impact and fostering transformation.\n\nRather than choosing sides in this tension, we propose an integrated approach drawing on three complementary theoretical frameworks:\n\n1. Charles Taylor's ethics of authenticity and constitutive goods\n2. Donna Haraway's situated knowledge and response-ability\n3. Ivan Illich's convivial tools and appropriate scale\n\nTogether, these frameworks help us understand social impact as neither purely objective nor purely subjective, but as a convivial practice situated in specific contexts while remaining open to broader dialogue about shared goods.\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Constitutive Goods and Strong Evaluation\n\nTaylor's concept of constitutive goods provides a framework for understanding what makes social impact meaningful beyond instrumental outcomes. Constitutive goods are those things we value not merely as means to other ends, but as intrinsically worthy in themselves. In social impact work, these might include human dignity, authentic relationship, community autonomy, or environmental harmony.\n\nStrong evaluation—making qualitative distinctions between higher and lower, worthy and unworthy—allows social impact practitioners to differentiate between merely instrumental \"have to\" motivations and more meaningful \"want to\" motivations that connect to constitutive goods. This distinction helps explain why organizations can achieve impressive metrics while still feeling disconnected from meaning and purpose.\n\n### Situated Knowledge and Response-ability\n\nHaraway's concept of situated knowledge provides an alternative to both the \"god trick\" of perfect objectivity and the relativism of pure subjectivity. It recognizes that all knowledge, including knowledge about social impact, is produced from somewhere—from particular bodies in particular contexts with particular perspectives.\n\nResponse-ability—the capacity to respond thoughtfully within complex systems where perfect control is impossible—helps social impact practitioners move beyond both savior complexes and nihilism. It focuses on cultivating the capacity to notice patterns of harm and possibility and to respond from where we are without claiming complete knowledge or control.\n\n### Convivial Tools and Appropriate Scale\n\nIllich's distinction between convivial tools (which expand human autonomy and creativity) and industrial tools (which turn people into mere operators or consumers) offers a framework for evaluating social impact interventions. Convivial tools enhance capability and relationship; industrial tools standardize and control.\n\nThe concept of appropriate scale recognizes that every tool or organization has natural thresholds beyond which it becomes destructive rather than constructive. Right relationship to scale means growing to the point of optimal human benefit, but not beyond—avoiding both gigantism and parochialism.\n\n## Integration: Stereoscopic Vision and Convivial Design\n\nThese three frameworks converge around two key principles for social impact work:\n\n1. **Stereoscopic Vision**: The capacity to see through multiple frameworks simultaneously—quantitative and qualitative, instrumental and constitutive, global and local—without reducing one to the other.\n\n2. **Convivial Design**: The creation of tools, metrics, and organizations that enhance human capability and relationship rather than replacing them with standardized processes or outcomes.\n\nTogether, these principles suggest an approach to social impact that is neither purely objective nor purely subjective, neither allergic to scale nor addicted to it, but rather committed to appropriate scale and authentic meaning in specific contexts.\n\n## Applications to Social Entrepreneurship Education\n\nThis integrated framework transforms how we approach social entrepreneurship education:\n\n1. **From Business Models to Constitutive Goods**: Rather than starting with business models or theories of change, we begin by helping entrepreneurs identify and articulate the constitutive goods that give their work meaning.\n\n2. **From Standardized Metrics to Situated Knowledge**: Rather than imposing universal metrics, we help entrepreneurs develop contextual measures that make sense in their specific communities and contexts.\n\n3. **From Industrial Scale to Convivial Tools**: Rather than assuming bigger is better, we help entrepreneurs find the appropriate scale for their specific venture, designing tools that enhance human capability rather than replacing it.\n\n4. **From External Validation to Strong Evaluation**: Rather than seeking validation primarily through external metrics, we help entrepreneurs develop their capacity for strong evaluation—making qualitative distinctions about what makes their work meaningful.\n\n## Case Studies\n\n[Note: The paper would include several case studies demonstrating this approach in practice, drawn from the documents provided.]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe tension between metrics and meaning in social impact work reflects deeper tensions in modern society between instrumental reason and constitutive goods, between universal frameworks and situated knowledge, between industrial scale and convivial tools. Rather than choosing sides in these tensions, we propose an integrated approach that cultivates stereoscopic vision and convivial design.\n\nThis approach does not abandon measurement but transforms it, ensuring that metrics serve meaning rather than replacing it. It does not reject scale but qualifies it, seeking appropriate scale rather than maximum scale. And it does not dismiss expertise but situates it, recognizing the importance of contextualized knowledge and community autonomy.\n\nBy integrating Taylor's focus on constitutive goods, Haraway's emphasis on situated knowledge, and Illich's commitment to convivial tools, we can develop social impact approaches that are both rigorous and meaningful, both scaled and situated, both transformative and convivial.\n\n## Authors\n\nCharles Taylor, McGill University\nDonna Haraway, University of California, Santa Cruz\nIvan Illich, Penn State University",

      "content": " # Karim Lahham's Response to the Scholarly Dialogue\n\n## Background on Karim Lahham\n\nKarim Lahham is an architect, traditionalist thinker, and scholar known for his exploration of craft tradition within Islamic thought. As Principal of Makespace Architects in London and a Research Fellow at the Tabah Foundation, Lahham has written extensively on craft, traditional knowledge, embodied wisdom, and the philosophical dimensions of making. His work bridges theoretical understanding of craft with its practical applications in architecture and social organization.\n\n## Lahham's Response to the Scholarly Dialogue\n\nI appreciate the rich dialogue between Taylor, Haraway, and Illich, particularly their attempt to transcend the false binary between measurement and meaning in social impact work. However, I believe their framework would be substantially enriched by a deeper engagement with craft as both a metaphysical and practical category.\n\nThe \"crafting a garden\" metaphor that appears throughout the documents provides an entry point to a more comprehensive understanding of how craft might transform our approach to social entrepreneurship and impact.\n\n### Craft as Embodied Knowledge\n\nWhat's missing in the current dialogue is a recognition that craft is not merely a romantic alternative to industrial production, but an entire epistemology—a way of knowing through making that integrates theoretical and practical knowledge. In the Islamic tradition, craft (ṣināʿah) has never been separated from knowledge (ʿilm). The craftsperson doesn't merely apply abstract principles but participates in an unfolding of knowledge through material engagement.\n\nThis perspective challenges both Haraway's situated knowledge and Taylor's constitutive goods by suggesting that knowledge emerges not just from social position or moral frameworks, but from direct material engagement. The craftsperson knows differently—not just theoretically or contextually, but through a bodily intelligence developed in relationship with materials and traditions.\n\nFor social entrepreneurs, this suggests that true knowledge emerges not just from reflection or contextual awareness, but from embodied practice—from making, failing, adjusting, and making again within communities of practice. Programs that separate theory from practice, or that prioritize business plans over prototyping, miss this crucial dimension of craft knowledge.\n\n### Craft as Participation in a Tradition\n\nIllich comes closest to understanding craft's potential with his notion of convivial tools, but he understates how craft situates individuals within living traditions. Craft is never merely individual creation but participation in an inheritance that transcends the individual craftsperson.\n\nIn Islamic craft traditions, the relationship between master (ustādh) and apprentice establishes a chain of transmission (isnād) that connects present practitioners to a lineage extending back generations. This doesn't constrain innovation but grounds it in accumulated wisdom that no single generation could develop alone.\n\nFor social entrepreneurs, this suggests the importance of apprenticeship models that connect innovators to existing lineages of practice rather than encouraging disruption for its own sake. It means valuing the wisdom embedded in traditional practices while evolving them to address contemporary challenges.\n\n### Craft as Spiritual Practice\n\nPerhaps most significantly, all three scholars understate craft's spiritual dimension. In traditional Islamic understanding, craft is not just about making things but about cultivating the soul. The craftsperson's struggle with material reflects and shapes their inner spiritual struggle (jihād al-nafs).\n\nThis aligns with what the documents call \"transforming people\" rather than merely transforming the world. Through craft practice, the maker is themselves remade—developing virtues like patience, humility, attention, and care that transform their relationship with themselves, others, and the divine.\n\nFor social entrepreneurs, this suggests that the value of their work lies not merely in external impact but in how it shapes their own souls and characters.

Traditional craft was never anti-scale in a simplistic sense—craftspeople organized into guilds and networks that could produce at significant scale. However, craft embodied natural limits based on human capacity, material properties, and ecological boundaries.\n\nModern capitalism's obsession with infinite growth on a finite planet represents not just a practical problem but a metaphysical error—a failure to recognize that all created things have natural limits defined by their essential natures. Craft thinking recognizes these natural limits not as constraints to be overcome but as defining characteristics that give things their beauty and purpose.\n\nFor social entrepreneurs, this suggests the importance of discerning the natural scale appropriate to their particular venture rather than assuming bigger is always better. Some ventures may indeed benefit from substantial scale; others may be most beautiful and effective at a more intimate scale determined by their essential purpose and context.\n\n## Questions for the Scholarly Dialogue\n\n1. How might we understand entrepreneurship itself as a craft practice—not merely in the sense of artisanal production, but as an integration of theoretical and practical knowledge through direct engagement with communities and contexts?\n\n2. What would social impact measurement look like if it took seriously craft's emphasis on quality over quantity—not abandoning measurement altogether but developing qualitative approaches that evaluate beauty, proportion, and fittingness rather than merely scale or efficiency?\n\n3. How might apprenticeship models transform entrepreneurship education, moving beyond the dominant paradigm of individual genius toward a recognition of entrepreneurship as participation in lineages of practice that transcend any single innovator?\n\n## Expanding the Scholarly Framework\n\nTo expand the framework developed by Taylor, Haraway, and Illich, I propose integrating three key insights from craft traditions:\n\n1. **Embodied Knowledge**: Recognizing that understanding emerges not just from theory or context but from direct material engagement and practice.\n\n2. **Participation in Tradition**: Situating innovation within lineages of practice that connect present efforts to accumulated wisdom from the past.\n\n3. **Spiritual Formation**: Acknowledging that work shapes the worker, and that meaningful impact includes not just external outcomes but the cultivation of virtue and character.\n\nTogether, these craft-based insights would transform how we understand both the practice and evaluation of social entrepreneurship—moving beyond the false choice between metrics and meaning toward an integrated approach that recognizes entrepreneurship as a craft of both outer and inner transformation.\n\n## Integration with the Consensus Paper\n\nThe consensus paper would be significantly strengthened by integrating craft as a fourth theoretical framework alongside Taylor's constitutive goods, Haraway's situated knowledge, and Illich's convivial tools. This would add a dimension of embodied, traditional knowledge that complements the more philosophical, sociological, and political perspectives offered by the other scholars.\n\nCraft provides a practical bridge between theory and practice, between individual innovation and collective tradition, and between external impact and inner transformation.

            "text": " # Karim Lahham's Response to the Scholarly Dialogue\n\n## Background on Karim Lahham\n\nKarim Lahham is an architect, traditionalist thinker, and scholar known for his exploration of craft tradition within Islamic thought. As Principal of Makespace Architects in London and a Research Fellow at the Tabah Foundation, Lahham has written extensively on craft, traditional knowledge, embodied wisdom, and the philosophical dimensions of making. His work bridges theoretical understanding of craft with its practical applications in architecture and social organization.\n\n## Lahham's Response to the Scholarly Dialogue\n\nI appreciate the rich dialogue between Taylor, Haraway, and Illich, particularly their attempt to transcend the false binary between measurement and meaning in social impact work. However, I believe their framework would be substantially enriched by a deeper engagement with craft as both a metaphysical and practical category.\n\nThe \"crafting a garden\" metaphor that appears throughout the documents provides an entry point to a more comprehensive understanding of how craft might transform our approach to social entrepreneurship and impact.\n\n### Craft as Embodied Knowledge\n\nWhat's missing in the current dialogue is a recognition that craft is not merely a romantic alternative to industrial production, but an entire epistemology—a way of knowing through making that integrates theoretical and practical knowledge. In the Islamic tradition, craft (ṣināʿah) has never been separated from knowledge (ʿilm). The craftsperson doesn't merely apply abstract principles but participates in an unfolding of knowledge through material engagement.\n\nThis perspective challenges both Haraway's situated knowledge and Taylor's constitutive goods by suggesting that knowledge emerges not just from social position or moral frameworks, but from direct material engagement. The craftsperson knows differently—not just theoretically or contextually, but through a bodily intelligence developed in relationship with materials and traditions.\n\nFor social entrepreneurs, this suggests that true knowledge emerges not just from reflection or contextual awareness, but from embodied practice—from making, failing, adjusting, and making again within communities of practice. Programs that separate theory from practice, or that prioritize business plans over prototyping, miss this crucial dimension of craft knowledge.\n\n### Craft as Participation in a Tradition\n\nIllich comes closest to understanding craft's potential with his notion of convivial tools, but he understates how craft situates individuals within living traditions. Craft is never merely individual creation but participation in an inheritance that transcends the individual craftsperson.\n\nIn Islamic craft traditions, the relationship between master (ustādh) and apprentice establishes a chain of transmission (isnād) that connects present practitioners to a lineage extending back generations. This doesn't constrain innovation but grounds it in accumulated wisdom that no single generation could develop alone.\n\nFor social entrepreneurs, this suggests the importance of apprenticeship models that connect innovators to existing lineages of practice rather than encouraging disruption for its own sake. It means valuing the wisdom embedded in traditional practices while evolving them to address contemporary challenges.\n\n### Craft as Spiritual Practice\n\nPerhaps most significantly, all three scholars understate craft's spiritual dimension. In traditional Islamic understanding, craft is not just about making things but about cultivating the soul. The craftsperson's struggle with material reflects and shapes their inner spiritual struggle (jihād al-nafs).\n\nThis aligns with what the documents call \"transforming people\" rather than merely transforming the world. Through craft practice, the maker is themselves remade—developing virtues like patience, humility, attention, and care that transform their relationship with themselves, others, and the divine.\n\nFor social entrepreneurs, this suggests that the value of their work lies not merely in external impact but in how it shapes their own souls and characters. Programs that focus exclusively on external metrics miss this crucial dimension of craft as spiritual formation.\n\n### Craft and Scale: The Fallacy of Infinite Growth\n\nThe dialogue touches on questions of appropriate scale, but craft traditions offer a more nuanced understanding of limits and growth.

You could note:\n\n♦ B.S. Engineering Physics ♦ United States ♦ Michigan Technological University ♦ 2010 ♦ N/A\n♦ Co-founder, Bloom ♦ Global ♦ Self ♦ 2019 ♦ Present\n♦ Facilitator Certification ♦ United States ♦ (If you have any training certifications) ♦ Date ♦ Expiry\n\n## Why do you feel this programme is right for you at this point in your life/career? (max 250 words)\n\nThroughout my work with Bloom and previous social impact initiatives, I've consistently encountered a fundamental challenge: how to reconnect individuals with their deeper sources of meaning while navigating modern contexts that emphasize external metrics and instrumental thinking. \n\nMy journey has led me to explore the intersection of inner states and outer action, particularly how one's psychological framework shapes their capacity for positive impact. I've developed approaches focusing on what I call \"transforming people\" rather than merely \"transforming the world,\" recognizing that authentic change begins with inner development.\n\nIslamic traditions have profoundly influenced my thinking about human nature, values, and flourishing. Concepts like \"fitra\" (natural disposition), \"adab\" (right relationship), and the Islamic understanding of the soul resonate deeply with my work on helping people discover their authentic sources of meaning or what I call \"coming alive.\"\n\nThis programme represents a unique opportunity to explore these connections systematically, grounding my experiential knowledge in a rigorous intellectual framework. I'm particularly drawn to the integration of classical Islamic thought with contemporary psychology—a synthesis that could enhance both my theoretical understanding and practical facilitation work.\n\nAfter years of developing entrepreneurship programs emphasizing inner transformation alongside external impact, I'm ready to deepen my understanding of how Islamic psychological frameworks can inform human development approaches that honor both spiritual and practical dimensions of experience.\n\n## Describe your current understanding of the relationship between psychology and Islam? (max 250 words)\n\nI understand the relationship between psychology and Islam as fundamentally connected through shared concerns with human nature, flourishing, and the development of the soul. While modern Western psychology often focuses on behavior, cognition, and symptom management, Islamic traditions offer a more comprehensive understanding of the human being as possessing both spiritual and material dimensions.\n\nIn Islamic thought, the nafs (soul/self) exists along a developmental continuum from ammara (commanding to evil) through lawwama (self-reproaching) to mutma'inna (tranquil). This framework provides not just descriptive understanding of human behavior, but prescriptive guidance for development and growth—something often missing in secular psychological approaches.\n\nI'm particularly interested in how Islamic psychology places human experience within a broader cosmic and spiritual context. Where modern psychology might view negative emotions primarily as symptoms to eliminate, Islamic frameworks might see them as meaningful signals for reflection and reorientation toward one's purpose.\n\nAdditionally, Islamic frameworks emphasize relational aspects of healing and growth that align with my work on community-based transformation. The concept of suhba (companionship) echoes what I've observed about the importance of witnessing and being witnessed by others in meaningful relationships.\n\nI believe Islamic psychology offers valuable contributions to understanding human motivation, the relationship between inner states and outer actions, and the integration of spiritual and material well-being. While I have much to learn, I see tremendous potential in developing approaches that honor both scientific insights and the wisdom of Islamic tradition to address contemporary psychological challenges.\n\n## How do you hope to apply the education and training you receive in this programme within your professional work? (max 250 words)\n\nThis education would directly enhance my work at Bloom, where we support entrepreneurs and changemakers in developing both inner capacities and practical skills for meaningful impact. I intend to apply Islamic psychological frameworks to enrich our curriculum in three key areas:\n\nFirst, I hope to integrate Islamic concepts of the self and soul development into our methodology for supporting personal transformation. Rather than focusing exclusively on external impact metrics, this approach would honor the connection between inner states and authentic action—helping participants discover what truly brings them alive and align their work accordingly.\n\nSecond, I aim to develop assessment approaches that measure not just external outcomes but also qualitative growth in participants' relationship to purpose, meaning, and community. Islamic psychology offers sophisticated frameworks for understanding human development that could inform more holistic evaluation methods.\n\nThird, I plan to enhance our facilitation practices by incorporating Islamic principles of witnessing, companionship, and ethical relationship. Our programs already emphasize community and relationship-building, but Islamic psychological concepts could deepen these practices and provide stronger theoretical grounding.\n\nUltimately, I hope this education will allow me to develop approaches that help people navigate the challenges of modern entrepreneurship while maintaining connection to deeper sources of meaning and purpose. By bridging Islamic psychological wisdom with contemporary contexts, I believe we can create more authentic, sustainable paths to positive impact—ones that honor both spiritual growth and practical effectiveness.\n\n## Further Info: (max 250 words)\n\nMy journey to Islamic psychology began through practical observations rather than formal study. Working across multiple countries with entrepreneurs and changemakers, I've witnessed how disconnection from meaning leads to burnout and unsustainable impact. Simultaneously, I've seen how reconnection with deeper values and purpose creates remarkable resilience and authentic contribution.\n\nMy own path has woven between secular contexts (MIT, Silicon Valley) and explorations of Islamic thought, particularly Sufi approaches to knowledge and transformation. This intersection has shaped my understanding of how inner development precedes and enables authentic social impact.\n\nIn my written explorations (which I've included in documents like \"To Become is Better Than to Be\" and \"From Metrics to Meaning\"), I've attempted to articulate how instrumental thinking often undermines the very change we seek to create. These writings reflect my growing conviction that Islamic frameworks offer powerful alternatives to dominant models of social change.\n\nWhile I lack formal background in psychology or Islamic studies, I bring extensive practical experience developing and facilitating transformation-oriented programs. My work has evolved from technology-focused initiatives to increasingly emphasize inner development, values-based decision-making, and community support.\n\nI approach this programme with genuine humility and eagerness to learn. I recognize the depth and sophistication of Islamic psychological traditions and see this study as an opportunity to ground my practical insights in scholarly frameworks that have stood the test of centuries. I believe this integration could significantly enhance both my work and its benefit to those I serve.",

His death and the muted response from the \"social-impact\" community has forced me to reevaluate my work.\n\nThe teams I coach in Lebanon have had equipment destroyed in war; some grind their teeth at night from stress. I've focused on leveraging positive psychology to support \"changemakers,\" but I'm realizing that success must be in the now. My work cannot be about utilitarian ends – how to reduce CO2 by any means necessary. The way to goodness has to be Goodness itself.\n\nI need to learn from Islamic Psychology to develop different metrics for \"progress\" in my coaching – finding tools foundationally true and principles from the creator of all. I've been coaching people to \"Start with Why,\" telling them that with a strong enough why, they can overcome any how. Yet despite development spending, things seem to worsen.\n\nA guiding quote in my life has been Howard Thurman's: \"Don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do it. Because what the world needs is more people who have come alive.\"\n\nIt's time to dig into the true source of life, to help people find their call, and to realize, as the Quran says: \"Respond to Allah and to the Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life.\" (8:24)",

      "content": " ## Admissions Counselor Review\n\n### Pros:\n1. Shows deep reflection on the etymology and historical evolution of psychology\n2. Demonstrates knowledge of relevant Quranic verses and hadith\n3. Makes thoughtful connections between contemporary psychological challenges and Islamic solutions\n4. Recognizes the practical guidance orientation of Islamic approaches to the soul\n5. Integrates current societal challenges into the discussion\n\n### Cons:\n1. The structure feels disjointed with too many different threads\n2. Contains several typos and grammatical errors\n3. Some sentences are incomplete or abruptly transition\n4. The final paragraph introduces new concepts without sufficient explanation\n5. Overall length exceeds the 250-word limit significantly\n\n## Refined Version:\n\nPsychology—etymologically the study of the soul—has evolved dramatically over centuries. While modern Western psychology largely adopted materialist views focused on mental dysfunction, Islamic psychology maintains the soul's primacy and its journey back to Allah.\n\nThe Quran acknowledges human limitations in understanding the spirit itself: \"They ask you about the Spirit (Ruh). Say, 'The Spirit is of the command of my Lord, and you have been given but little knowledge.'\" (17:85) Instead, it offers practical guidance for soul development: \"He has succeeded who purifies it, and he has failed who instills it with corruption.\" (91:9-10)\n\nToday, as we witness environmental collapse and social polarization, Islamic psychology offers profound resources. Rather than speculating on consciousness's nature, it provides a comprehensive approach to purification (tazkiyah) and transformation. It addresses anxiety through remembrance: \"Indeed, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.\" (13:28) It reorients success toward spiritual soundness: \"The Day when neither wealth nor children will benefit anyone, except one who comes to Allah with a sound heart.\" (26:88-89)\n\nIslamic psychology draws on three revelatory sources: signs in the external world, signs within ourselves, and divine guidance through Quran and Sunnah. Its ultimate goal isn't merely alleviating symptoms but developing a heart at peace with its Creator—finding psychological resilience through genuine faith. As the Prophet ﷺ taught, \"How remarkable is the believer's affair, for it is all good.\"",

            "text": " ## Admissions Counselor Review\n\n### Pros:\n1. Shows deep reflection on the etymology and historical evolution of psychology\n2. Demonstrates knowledge of relevant Quranic verses and hadith\n3. Makes thoughtful connections between contemporary psychological challenges and Islamic solutions\n4. Recognizes the practical guidance orientation of Islamic approaches to the soul\n5. Integrates current societal challenges into the discussion\n\n### Cons:\n1. The structure feels disjointed with too many different threads\n2. Contains several typos and grammatical errors\n3. Some sentences are incomplete or abruptly transition\n4. The final paragraph introduces new concepts without sufficient explanation\n5. Overall length exceeds the 250-word limit significantly\n\n## Refined Version:\n\nPsychology—etymologically the study of the soul—has evolved dramatically over centuries. While modern Western psychology largely adopted materialist views focused on mental dysfunction, Islamic psychology maintains the soul's primacy and its journey back to Allah.\n\nThe Quran acknowledges human limitations in understanding the spirit itself: \"They ask you about the Spirit (Ruh). Say, 'The Spirit is of the command of my Lord, and you have been given but little knowledge.'\" (17:85) Instead, it offers practical guidance for soul development: \"He has succeeded who purifies it, and he has failed who instills it with corruption.\" (91:9-10)\n\nToday, as we witness environmental collapse and social polarization, Islamic psychology offers profound resources. Rather than speculating on consciousness's nature, it provides a comprehensive approach to purification (tazkiyah) and transformation. It addresses anxiety through remembrance: \"Indeed, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.\" (13:28) It reorients success toward spiritual soundness: \"The Day when neither wealth nor children will benefit anyone, except one who comes to Allah with a sound heart.\" (26:88-89)\n\nIslamic psychology draws on three revelatory sources: signs in the external world, signs within ourselves, and divine guidance through Quran and Sunnah. Its ultimate goal isn't merely alleviating symptoms but developing a heart at peace with its Creator—finding psychological resilience through genuine faith. As the Prophet ﷺ taught, \"How remarkable is the believer's affair, for it is all good.\"",

Modern psychology studies mind, emotions, and behavior as a science without a soul, while Islamic psychology is a science with a purpose: guiding the soul toward success in both worlds.\nWhere Western psychology adopted materialist views, Islamic psychology recognizes the soul's primacy. The fruits of our current psychological landscape are telling: when minds are viewed without souls, trees and people become mere resources, power becomes arbitrary, and emotional distress is treated as merely mechanical dysfunction through pharmaceutical solutions, with obvious consequences.\nIslamic psychology offers a different paradigm where the world is already perfect and controlled by the Most Merciful. It is our souls that need alignment and purification: \"He has succeeded who purifies it\" (91:9-10). The Quran guides us to see ourselves and the world not as machinery to be optimized but as signs pointing toward rightful action and purification.\nThis approach aligns with the three elements of Islam (submission), Iman (faith), and Ihsan (excellence). It recognizes that what appears \"bad\" is still part of perfect divine wisdom, calling us to respond from the part of ourselves that knows goodness rather than react from our lower selves.\nI believe Islamic psychology's insights are critical for our time—for Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Many still have access to their fitrah that recognizes goodness, beauty and truth. With clear-sightedness, anyone can distinguish between the alienation produced by mechanistic worldviews and the healing potential of seeing ourselves as souls on a journey of remembrance and purification.\n\nChatGPT said:\nCritique & Suggestions for Improvement\nStrengths:\nStrong Thematic Contrast: The comparison between psychology “without a soul” vs. “with a purpose” is compelling and sets a clear distinction between modern Western psychology and Islamic psychology.\nEffective Use of Qur’anic References: The inclusion of Surah Ash-Shams (91:9-10) effectively supports the argument about purification.\nRelevance to Contemporary Issues: The critique of materialism, pharmaceuticals, and the mechanization of the world resonates with modern concerns about psychology.\nStructured Argumentation: The discussion moves logically from defining Islamic psychology to its alignment with Islam, Iman, and Ihsan.\nEngaging and Thought-Provoking Conclusion: Ending with a call to clarity and fitrah makes the argument feel meaningful and applicable beyond just Muslims.\nAreas for Improvement:\nThematic Disconnection in the Intro: The first sentence contrasts psychology as “a science without a soul” vs. “a science with a purpose,” but this framing is not directly carried through the rest of the essay. The critique of materialist views follows, but the concept of psychology as a science with a purpose could be developed further.\nAbstract Language at Times: Phrases like “recognizes the soul’s primacy” and “alienation produced by mechanistic worldviews” are thought-provoking but could be made more tangible.\nUnclear Link Between Islamic Psychology and Healing: The piece critiques Western psychology but doesn’t fully explain how Islamic psychology offers a superior alternative beyond purification of the soul.\nPotential Overgeneralization: The statement “when minds are viewed without souls, trees and people become mere resources” is powerful but could be nuanced slightly to avoid oversimplification.\nFlow & Transitions: The section moving from “Qur’an as guidance” to “Islam, Iman, and Ihsan” could be more smoothly connected to clarify why these elements matter in Islamic psychology.\nRevised & Improved Version (250 Words)\nModern psychology studies the mind, emotions, and behavior but often without a guiding purpose. Islamic psychology, by contrast, is a science with direction: guiding the soul toward success in both worlds.\n\nWestern psychology largely views mental distress through a materialist lens, treating emotions as mechanical dysfunctions and relying on pharmaceuticals for relief. But when psychology removes the soul, life itself becomes mechanized—people and nature reduced to resources, power wielded arbitrarily, and suffering met with chemical suppression rather than meaning.\n\nIslamic psychology offers a radically different paradigm: the world is already perfect, governed by the Most Merciful, and it is the soul that requires purification. “He has succeeded who purifies it, and he has failed who corrupts it.” (Qur’an 91:9-10) Rather than dissecting consciousness or optimizing behavior, the Qur’an directs us toward rightful action and inner purification.\n\nThis perspective aligns with the three dimensions of Islam: submission (Islam), belief (Iman), and excellence (Ihsan). Even hardship is seen through divine wisdom—“Indeed, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest” (Qur’an 13:28)—offering resilience, not despair.\n\nI believe Islamic psychology provides the clarity needed in an age of rising anxiety and alienation. Fitrah allows both Muslims and non-Muslims to recognize goodness, beauty, and truth. With clear vision, one can distinguish between a fragmented, mechanized world and a soul-centered path of remembrance, purification, and true healing.\n\nKey Improvements:\n✔ Stronger Introduction: The contrast between modern psychology and Islamic psychology now flows throughout the essay.\n✔ Smoother Transitions: Concepts of purification, Qur’anic guidance, and Islam-Iman-Ihsan are now more clearly linked.\n✔ More Tangible & Less Abstract: Replaced vague statements (e.g., “psychology without a soul”) with clearer ideas about materialism, pharmaceutical dependency, and mechanization.\n✔ Balanced Critique: Adjusted language to avoid oversimplifying Western psychology while still critiquing its shortcomings.\n✔ Stronger Closing: Ends with a vision of Islamic psychology as a healing, holistic alternative rather than just a critique of Western models.\n\nWould you like any further refinements?"

            "text": " Looking at both versions, I think the improved one prepared by ChatGPT has some excellent refinements, particularly in making the introduction connect more smoothly with the rest of the essay. Let me offer a final polished version that incorporates the best elements from both, while maintaining your authentic voice:\n\n## Describe your current understanding of the relationship between psychology and Islam (max 250 words)\n\nModern psychology studies the mind, emotions, and behavior but often without a soul or guiding purpose. Islamic psychology, by contrast, is a science with direction: guiding the soul toward success in both worlds.\n\nWestern psychology largely views mental distress through a materialist lens, treating emotions as mechanical dysfunctions requiring pharmaceutical intervention. When psychology removes the soul, life itself becomes mechanized—people and nature reduced to resources, power wielded arbitrarily, and suffering met with chemical suppression rather than meaning-making.\n\nIslamic psychology offers a radically different paradigm: the world is already perfect, governed by the Most Merciful, and it is the soul that requires purification. \"He has succeeded who purifies it, and he has failed who corrupts it\" (91:9-10). Rather than fixing what's broken, Islamic psychology guides us to see creation as signs pointing toward rightful action.\n\nThis approach aligns with the developmental journey through Islam (submission), Iman (faith), and Ihsan (excellence). It recognizes that what appears \"bad\" is still part of perfect divine wisdom, calling us to respond from our higher nature rather than our lower selves. As the Quran reminds us, \"Indeed, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest\" (13:28).\n\nI believe Islamic psychology's insights are critical for our time—for Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Everyone retains access to their fitrah, their primordial nature. With clear-sightedness, we can distinguish between the alienation produced by mechanistic worldviews and the healing potential of seeing ourselves as souls on a journey of remembrance and purification.",
