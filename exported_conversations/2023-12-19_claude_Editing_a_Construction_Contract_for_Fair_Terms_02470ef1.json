Clarity and Specificity of Terms\n\nInitial: \"The First Party is advised to add a reasonable design and construction contingencies.\"\n\nUpdated: \"The First Party shall add design and construction contingencies not exceeding 10% of the total project cost to accommodate unforeseen conditions that may affect the actual cost. Any contingencies beyond this threshold require explicit approval from WET.\"\n\n2\\.

Obligations shall be suspended during the duration of such events.\"\n\n7\\. Termination Conditions\n\nInitial: Clause limited to exclusivity arrangement.\n\nUpdated: \"WET may terminate this agreement with a 30-day notice if the First Party materially breaches the contract, fails to make timely payments, or if force majeure events last longer than 60 days.\"\n\n8\\. Compliance with Laws\n\nInitial: Clause not explicitly mentioned.\n\nUpdated: \"WET will comply with all applicable U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to local Iraqi laws relevant to the project.\"\n\n9\\. Change in Scope or Amendments\n\nInitial: \"The provisions of this agreement apply to any changes...\"\n\nUpdated: \"Any changes or amendments to the project scope or contract terms must be mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties, with special consideration given to their impact on WET's responsibilities and liabilities.\"\n\n10\\.

Unauthorized disclosure may result in legal action and termination of this agreement.\"\n\n11\\. Accountability for Subcontractors\n\nInitial: Clause not explicitly mentioned.\n\nUpdated: \"WET is not liable for the actions or failures of subcontractors unless directly engaged by WET. The First Party is responsible for the due diligence and management of its subcontractors.\"\n\n12\\. Project Delays and Penalties\n\nInitial: Clause not explicitly mentioned.\n\nUpdated: \"WET is not liable for project delays caused by external factors beyond its control. If delays are caused by the First Party, WET reserves the right to adjust the project timeline and costs accordingly.\"\n\nThese revisions aim to provide clearer terms, limit WET's liabilities, and ensure fair treatment throughout the project. It's important for these revisions to be reviewed and approved by legal counsel experienced in international contracts to ensure legal compliance and enforceability.\n\nwhat potential pitfalls might come from their different interests.

Project Delays and Penalties\n\nLocation: Add a new section on Project Delays and Penalties.\n\nNew Paragraph: \"In case of delays attributable to WET, penalty clauses will be activated, offering compensation to the First Party for any additional costs or losses incurred due to the delay.\"\n\nThese revisions are aimed at enhancing the position and protections for the First Party in the contract. Make sure to integrate them appropriately and have them reviewed by a legal professional.\n\nHere's what party two wants to edit:\n\n1\\. Clarity and Specificity of Terms\n\nInitial: \"The First Party is advised to add a reasonable design and construction contingencies.\"\n\nUpdated: \"The First Party shall add design and construction contingencies not exceeding 10% of the total project cost to accommodate unforeseen conditions that may affect the actual cost. Any contingencies beyond this threshold require explicit approval from WET.\"\n\n2\\. Responsibility for Overruns\n\nInitial: \"Any expenses beyond the design budget will be reviewed and paid by the First Party.\"\n\nUpdated: \"Expenses beyond the initially agreed design budget, capped at \\[specific amount or percentage\\], will be reviewed. Additional expenses exceeding this cap require mutual agreement between both parties, with WET having the right to veto excessive overruns.\"\n\n3\\. Intellectual Property Rights\n\nInitial: Clause not explicitly mentioned.\n\nUpdated: \"WET retains exclusive rights to its technology and any derivatives thereof developed during this project. Jointly developed intellectual property will be co-owned, with commercialization terms to be mutually agreed upon.\"\n\n4\\. Dispute Resolution\n\nInitial: \"Arbitration through a three-person dispute review committee...\"\n\nUpdated: \"In the event of a dispute, parties will first attempt amicable resolution. Failing this, disputes will be subject to arbitration in the United Kingdom under the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) rules, and the decision rendered by such arbitration will be final and binding.\"\n\n5\\. Liability and Indemnification\n\nInitial: \"Each Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other Party...\"\n\nUpdated: \"WET's liability is limited to direct damages caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct in the design. WET is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Indemnification by WET is limited to claims directly arising from its breach of this agreement.\"\n\n6\\. Force Majeure\n\nInitial: Clause not explicitly mentioned.\n\nUpdated: \"WET shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this agreement due to force majeure events, including but not limited to natural disasters, wars, or governmental actions. Obligations shall be suspended during the duration of such events.\"\n\n7\\. Termination Conditions\n\nInitial: Clause limited to exclusivity arrangement.\n\nUpdated: \"WET may terminate this agreement with a 30-day notice if the First Party materially breaches the contract, fails to make timely payments, or if force majeure events last longer than 60 days.\"\n\n8\\. Compliance with Laws\n\nInitial: Clause not explicitly mentioned.\n\nUpdated: \"WET will comply with all applicable U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to local Iraqi laws relevant to the project.\"\n\n9\\. Change in Scope or Amendments\n\nInitial: \"The provisions of this agreement apply to any changes...\"\n\nUpdated: \"Any changes or amendments to the project scope or contract terms must be mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties, with special consideration given to their impact on WET's responsibilities and liabilities.\"\n\n10\\. Confidentiality and Data Protection\n\nInitial: \"Recipient of Second Party specific confidential/patented technology information agrees to restrict its use...\"\n\nUpdated: \"The First Party agrees to maintain strict confidentiality of WET's proprietary information and technology. Unauthorized disclosure may result in legal action and termination of this agreement.\"\n\n11\\. Accountability for Subcontractors\n\nInitial: Clause not explicitly mentioned.\n\nUpdated: \"WET is not liable for the actions or failures of subcontractors unless directly engaged by WET. The First Party is responsible for the due diligence and management of its subcontractors.\"\n\n12\\. Project Delays and Penalties\n\nInitial: Clause not explicitly mentioned.\n\nUpdated: \"WET is not liable for project delays caused by external factors beyond its control. If delays are caused by the First Party, WET reserves the right to adjust the project timeline and costs accordingly.\"\n\nThese revisions aim to provide clearer terms, limit WET's liabilities, and ensure fair treatment throughout the project. It's important for these revisions to be reviewed and approved by legal counsel experienced in international contracts to ensure legal compliance and enforceability.\n\nwhat potential pitfalls might come from their different interests.
