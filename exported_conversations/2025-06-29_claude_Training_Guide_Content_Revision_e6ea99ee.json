  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is working on developing a comprehensive 5-day solar energy training program for BEIT (Building Economic Initiatives Together) in Mosul, Iraq. They requested that Claude redesign training guides to more closely match their existing slide deck content, focusing on technical solar panel installation skills rather than broader business development topics that were outside their current scope and resources. The user emphasized wanting to stay true to their \"upgrade[On Going]\" Module 1 slides covering Days 1-5, which follow a structured Learn-Apply-Sell rhythm each day.\n\nClaude created detailed facilitator guides for the introduction through Day 2, then expanded to cover Days 3-5, incorporating real interview content and case studies from local solar professionals like Mohammed Al-Qatan and success stories from individuals like Yasir who transitioned from employee to solar business owner. The guides included specific speaker notes, timing, hands-on activities, and integration points with an Excel workbook containing tabs for different aspects like Ahmed's Cafe Load calculations, cost-curve analysis, mounting BOM, and pitch preparation materials.\n\nThe user then requested additional case studies, stories, and games mapped to each training day, along with printable materials for facilitators. Claude developed a comprehensive package including daily case studies (Ahmed's Coffee Shop, inverter quality investigation, wind load challenges, mosque expansion planning, and Zahra's textile workshop), interactive games (component speed dating, warranty red flag bingo, dust race challenge, solar shark tank, and troubleshooting relay race), and printable materials like customer objection cards and skill badges. The conversation concluded with Claude providing a thorough assessment of the slide deck progress and a detailed checklist for aligning slides, facilitator guides, workbook materials, and support resources, identifying that while the structure was solid at about 32% completion, significant work remained in adding speaker notes, visual elements, Excel integration callouts, and simplifying the Day 5 content to focus on technical skills rather than complex business development.",

They want it to:\n\nBe connected to what people learn over the course of the training\nBe fun/useful\nWork as a pre/post assessment for the ITC\nBe scorable\nBe less \"lame/simple\" than the current questions\n\nLooking at the current quiz, it's very generic financial literacy - not connected to solar installation business at all. Given the context of the solar training program, the financial literacy should be specifically about:\n\nRunning a solar installation business\nUnderstanding costs and pricing for solar systems\nROI calculations for customers\nCash flow management for a solar business\nUnderstanding the economics of solar vs generators in Iraq\n\nI should create questions that:\n\nUse real scenarios from the training (like Ahmed's coffee shop)\nInclude actual numbers in Iraqi dinars\nTest practical financial skills they'll need\nProgress from basic to more complex\nAre engaging and relevant to their future work\n\nLet me create a better assessment that ties directly to the solar training content.Looking at your current financial literacy quiz, it's too generic and disconnected from the solar training context. Let me create a more engaging, practical assessment that directly connects to what your trainees will actually use in their solar businesses in Mosul.Solar Business Financial Literacy Assessment - Pre/Post TestDocument # Solar Business Financial Literacy Assessment\n## Pre/Post Training Evaluation\n\n**Name:** _________________ **Date:** _________ **Pre-Test ☐ Post-Test ☐**\n\n---\n\n### Section A: Understanding Solar Economics (20 points)\n\n**1.

If batteries cost 1,500 IQD/Ah and you need 48V system, what's the minimum battery investment?\"\nSeasonal Adjustment:\n\"Summer production is 6 kWh/kW/day, winter is 3.5. How do you size a system for year-round 20 kWh/day needs?\"\nCompetition Analysis:\n\"Competitor quotes 15,000,000 IQD with cheap components. Your quality system costs 18,000,000. Write your value proposition.\"\nSupply Chain Finance:\n\"Chinese panels: 60-day shipping, 20% cheaper. Turkish panels: 7-day delivery. Calculate working capital impact.\"\nThis assessment transforms dry financial concepts into the actual decisions your trainees will face next month.

This is a 6-day, 70 % hands-on solar training. We start right now by meeting each other.”\n\nWhy Am I here?\nFacilitator notes:\nFacilitator:\u000b “Alright, everyone—let’s learn each other’s names and why we’re here today. We’re doing a sticky-note mingle.”\nStep 1: Write (30 s)\u000b “I’m going to pass out one coloured sticky-note and a pen to each of you. On your sticky, write one single word that best answers ‘Why I joined this solar training.’\nIt could be ‘energy’, ‘income’, ‘safety’, ‘future’, anything!\nKeep it short—just one word.”\n(Trainer walks around handing out sticky-notes and pens.)\n“Ready? Go—30 seconds!”\n(After ~30 s, trainer raises hand.)\u000b “Time!”\nStep 2: Mingle & Introduce (1 min 30 s)\u000b “Now, stand up, and find someone you don’t know. Swap sticky-notes: read their word and introduce your partner to your table in a quick 10-second popcorn burst.”\nPopcorn rule: when you’re ready, just call out someone’s name and toss them the “popcorn” to speak.\nExample pop: “Pop! John, tell us your word and why.”\n“Go! Mingle for 90 seconds.”\n(Trainer circulates, encourages quick popcorn calls at tables: “Pop! Aisha?” “Pop! Mahmoud?”)\nStep 3: Share & Sit (30 s)\u000b (After ~1 min 30 s, trainer claps hands.)\u000b “Awesome—have a seat! Let’s do quick popcorn on one word per table.”\nTrainer points to Table 1: “Pop! Table 1, who’s first?”\nA participant shares: “My word is………..”\nTrainer thanks them, then moves on: “Pop! Table 2?”\n“Great—now we know names and why we’re here. Let’s move on to our financial check-in.”\n\nGenerator Frustration → Solar Solution\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes (≈2 minutes)\nTransition from Sticky-Note Mingle\u000b “Great—now that we know why each of you joined, let’s see what our toughest daily headache looks like in real numbers.”\nPopcorn Share (20 s)\u000b “Pop! Who wants to shout out their worst generator story—noise at 3 AM, endless fuel smells, surprise breakdowns? Just one quick line.”\u000b (Allow 2–3 very rapid popcorn responses.)\nReveal the Bill (15 s)\u000b [Point to the photo and bill graphic]\u000b “This is an actual generator bill for a small café in Mosul: 500 000 IQD per month. That’s money burning away every 30 days.”\nQuick Math (20 s)\u000b “Let’s do the math together: 500 000 IQD × 12 = 6 000 000 IQD per year. Over just ten years, that’s 60 000 000 IQD—enough to buy multiple homes!”\u000b (Pause for effect.)\nSet up the Transition\u000b “We’re here today to put an end to that cycle. Solar can slash your energy cost—cleanly, quietly, forever. But to prove it, we need to link our technical skills with real money decisions.”\nSegue into Financial-Literacy Check-In\u000b “Next up: a 5-question check-in to see how you think about cash-flow, savings, and investments. We’ll come back on Day 5 and watch your answers change—just as our solar designs change these bills.”\nOn-Slide Timer\u000b (The bottom corner shows a 5:00 countdown for the quiz.)\u000b “Okay—take out your phones, scan the QR code on the next slide, and let’s begin our Financial-Literacy survey in 3…2…1… Go!”\n\nFinancial Literacy Pre-Quiz\nScan QR here\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nThe questions (will put on the Gform):\nIn one sentence, what does cash-flow mean to you?\nName one thing you save money for.\nIf you borrow 1 000 IQD at 5 % per month, how much do you repay after one month?\nList one variable expense in your home.\nHow could solar panels help your family budget?\nFacilitator notes:\nFacilitator (projecting QR on screen): “Okay everyone, next up is our Financial-Literacy Check-In. This will help us see where we all start—and we’ll repeat it on Day 5 to measure your progress.”\nExplain Purpose (30 s)\u000b “Solar isn’t just panels and wires—it’s also about return on investment, pay-back periods, and budgeting. So, we’ll do a quick 5-question survey right now. Don’t worry—there’s no grade, it’s just for you and to help me tailor the course.”\u000b\nGive Instructions (30 s)\u000b “Please take out your phone or device with internet.\u000b\nScan the big QR code on the screen.\nAnswer the 5 multiple-choice or short-answer questions.\nSubmit.”\u000b “If your connection is weak, please raise your hand now and I’ll pass you a paper copy—no problem.”\u000b\nStart the Timer (10 s)\u000b “I’m setting a 5-minute timer on the screen now. You’ll see it counting down.”\u000b\nMonitor & Assist (4 min 30 s)\u000b (Trainer walks around.)\u000b\n“Got your form open?”\n“Need a paper version?”\n“Any question on how to submit?”\u000b\nWarning at 1 Minute Left (10 s)\u000b (When timer hits 1:00)\u000b “One minute left, everyone—finish up your last answers and press Submit.”\u000b\nTime’s Up (10 s)\u000b (When timer ends)\u000b “Time! Please tap Submit now if you haven’t already.\u000b\nReassure & Transition (40 s)\u000b “Great job—that score is just for you. We’ll revisit it on Day 5 to see how much you’ve learned about managing project finances.\u000b Now, let’s move on to our first theory bridge: ‘Where Solar Fits in Iraq’.”\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nBefore we dive into today’s content, I want to show you the heartbeat of our entire training: the 3-Block Rhythm.\n📘 LEARN (First Block)\nWhat it is: A focused theory segment where we introduce concepts, review real data, and demo key techniques.\nWhy it matters: This gives you the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind every tool and calculation you’ll use.\nHow long: Roughly 45–60 minutes each morning.\n“In this block, feel free to ask questions—that’s exactly what it’s for.”\u000b\n🛠️ APPLY (Second Block)\nWhat it is: Hands-on practice. You’ll work in small teams at stations or on rigs, putting theory into action.\nWhy it matters: Muscle memory and real-world troubleshooting live here.\nHow long: 60–90 minutes, with a built-in rotation so you touch every station.\n“Here’s where mistakes are your best teachers—don’t be shy to try, fail fast, and ask for help.”\u000b\n💼 SELL (Third Block)\nWhat it is: A quick pitch, reflection, or mini-task where you frame what you’ve learned in a customer context: ROI pitches, service designs, troubleshooting reports.\nWhy it matters: Our end users—and many of your future clients—care about the numbers and the story.\nHow long: 30–45 minutes, wrapping up each day on a high-energy note.\n“This final block trains you to translate skills into value—and gives us a fun way to celebrate progress each day!”\u000b\nTransition Script:\u000b “Every day, we’ll follow this rhythm: Learn new theory, Apply it in the field, then Sell it back as a solution. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle—and you’ll use it in your design-competition finale. Ready to see it in action? Let’s switch to all of each day block rhythm”\n5\n\nDay 1-5 and Day 6 The Design Competition\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nLearn\nApply\nSell\nDay 1\nIntro to PV fundamentals \nComponent stations tour\nPanel & inverter hands-on\nLoad-audit workshop\n1-min ROI pitch video\nDay 2\nDeep dive: fuses & BMS\nDatasheet scavenger hunt\nWire-bench & breaker test\nBattery temp-log\nWarranty red-flag exercise\nDay 3\nCable sizing & torque logic\nFrame & wind loads\n4-panel roof-rig build\nDust-loss demo\nCleaning service pricing\nDay 4\nPVsyst simulation basics\nGrowth & shade analysis\nRoof plan editing\nCash-flow builder\nExpansion & service pitch\nDay 5\nTroubleshoot common faults\nFinal design sprint\nFault-hunt on mini-rig\nROI & margin wrap-up\nFinal 5-min pitch\nOptional Day 6\nDesign competition preparation\nDesign competition build-out\nWinner announcements\nFacilitator notes:\n“This is your roadmap for the week. Each day you’ll learn core theory, apply it hands-on, then sell your solution back to the class. Notice how the rhythm repeats—by Day 6 you’ll have integrated everything into a final design competition.”\n\nDay 1 Learning Objectives\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nLearn\nIdentify & handle real PV components\nRead key datasheet specs (Voc, Isc, temp-coef)\nApply\nCalculate household load in amps → kWh\nApply safety lock-out & DC rules\nSell\nCompare cost: generator vs solar (ROI)\nReflect & improve with daily feedback wall\nFacilitator notes:\n“Here are the six objectives for Day 1. The first two are Learn: by mid-morning you’ll be able to identify every PV component on the table and interpret Voc, Isc, and temperature coefficients from a datasheet.\nThen in Apply, you’ll calculate a real family’s load in amps and kilowatt-hours—and practice our zero-injury lock-out pledge on actual panels.\nFinally, in Sell, you’ll use those numbers to compare generator vs solar ROI and record a quick 1-minute pitch.\nFeel free to refer back to these as we go—each objective aligns to our Learn-Apply-Sell rhythm.”\n\nSafety First\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nGoal: 0 accidents all week\n(Share Ali’s story) \n⚠️ Isolate circuit — lock-out tag & padlock\n⚠️ Verify zero volts (DC first) with multimeter\n⚠️ Wear gloves & safety glasses\n⚠️ When work in electricity combine another person with you.\n⚠️ Use isolated tools while working in electricity.\n⚠️ One person shouts \"CLEAR!\" before reconnect\n⚠️ Never touch a live DC string\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nOpening Hook (30 s):\n“Before we jump in, I want to remind everyone why safety is non-negotiable. Last month, our colleague Ali got an accident with electricity because [the detailed story to be confirmed].”\n[Show a brief photo if available]\nLesson from Ali’s Story (45 s):\n“Ali admitted later that he needs to pay attention to [the detailed mistake to be confirmed].”\n“We don’t want ‘it always works’—we want zero incidents.”\nStep-by-Step Safety Ritual (1 min):\nIsolate: “First, open the breaker and hang the lock-out tag and padlock. That tag must read your name and time.”\nTest for Zero Volts: “Always grab your multimeter, set it to DC volts, and verify zero at both panel junction and inverter input.”\nPPE On: “Gloves and safety glasses stay on from start to finish—no exceptions.”\nBuddy System: “Never work alone. Your partner watches your back, hands you tools, and calls out if they see anything unsafe.”\nInsulated Tools: “Only use insulated screwdrivers, pliers, and cutters. Ordinary tools can turn into conductors.”\n“CLEAR!” Confirmation: “Before reconnecting, one person must shout ‘CLEAR!’ and everyone else must acknowledge. Only then do you switch the breaker back on.”\nHands Off Live DC: “Under no circumstances touch a live DC conductor. If you find voltage present, repeat steps 1–3.”\u000b\nReinforce & Model (45 s):\n“Let’s demo right now. Volunteer with me: please come lock out this breaker.”\n[Walk through the lock-out/tag-out procedure slowly, narrating each step: writing tag, locking padlock, testing multimeter, buddy confirmation, shout ‘CLEAR!’]\n“See how deliberate we are? This ritual is your daily habit—every single morning, before any hands-on work.”\u000b\nTransition to Next Topic (15 s): “Okay, with zero-injury top of mind, we’re ready to explore why Iraq’s energy mix drives us to solar. Let’s move on to how generators, grid, and sunshine fit into our story.”\n\nGrid 8-12 h, 100-160 IQD/kWh  \nGenerator 380-450 IQD/kWh  \nSolar ≈150 IQD/kWh)\nIraq Energy Reality\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n“Before we talk components, let’s ground ourselves in why we’re here: energy in Iraq.”\nDiesel Generators (30 s)\n“Right now, most homes and shops run on diesel generators.”\n“They cost 380 to 450 IQD per kilowatt-hour—that’s money straight out of your pocket. And they fill our air with smoke we all breathe.”\nQuick check-in: “By show of hands, who here has heard their generator run for more than 12 hours in one day?” (Pause for a few raised hands.)\nNational Grid (20 s)\n“The grid is cheaper—100 to 160 IQD/kWh—but only delivers power 8–12 hours a day, and the voltage wobbles so lights flicker and devices burn out. Not exactly reliable.”\nSunshine Potential (20 s)\n“Contrast that with 3 000 hours of sun every year in Mosul—more than 8 hours of sun daily on average. The sun is free, constant, and our best untapped resource.”\nSolar Cost Comparison (20 s)\nSolar Adoption (≈ 25 s)\nPoint to “< 5%”\n“Today solar makes up less than 5 percent of our energy mix.”\n“Yet with 3 000 sun-hours per year, the sun is our most reliable and pollution-free source.”\n“Yet each year, more people in Mosul are installing solar panels—adoption is rising fast”\n“And when you calculate all costs—hardware, installation, and maintenance—solar can already compete with grid rates, especially if you factor in the value of clean air.”\nTransition to Next Slide (15 s)\n“Now that we see why solar makes sense here, let’s look at the three main ways to set up a system—off-grid, on-grid, and hybrid.”\nClick to reveal “Three Solar Set-ups” slide.\n\nThree Solar Set-Ups\nOff Grid System\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nFacilitator notes:\nIntroduction (10 s)\n“Now that we’ve seen why solar makes sense in Mosul, let’s tour the three main system types.”\u000b\nOff-Grid Systems (25 s)\nPoint to OFF-GRID photo.\n“Off-grid systems run completely independent of the grid—panels, charge controller, inverter, battery all stand alone.\nUse case: Remote villages or telecom towers.\nPro: True energy independence, no grid fees.\nCon: Batteries cost a lot and need replacement.”\u000b\nOn-Grid Systems (25 s)\nPoint to ON-GRID photo.\n“On-grid systems hook directly to the utility—no batteries.\nUse case: Stable grid areas (e.g., government compounds in Baghdad).\nPro: Lowest upfront cost, you export surplus to the grid.\nCon: If the grid goes down, your solar shuts off too (anti-islanding), so no backup power.”\u000b\nHybrid Systems (25 s)\nPoint to HYBRID photo.\n“Hybrid systems blend the two: you stay tied to the grid and have battery backup.\nPro: You use solar when it’s available, draw from batteries during outages, and still export excess.\nCon: More complex equipment and higher cost—but this is the sweet spot for most Mosul homes, where outages are common but grid connection exists.”\u000b\nTransition (5 s)\n“In this training we’ll focus on hybrid designs, since they give the best reliability and ROI in our context.”\n\nWall of Challenges • 49 °C \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n1️⃣ Unveil the slide.\n\n2️⃣ Ask quick show-of-hands poll:\n   “Who here has measured rooftop heat over 45 °C?”  (Count.)\n   “Whose family paid > 15 k IQD per amp last month?” (Count.)\n\n3️⃣ Invite TWO learners (≤ 30 s each) to tell a short story:\n   • One about generator cost\n   • One about roof heat or dust\n\n4️⃣ React:\n   “These four pains are the market opportunity we’re tackling this week.”\n\n5️⃣ Segue:\n   “To solve them we first need to understand how light becomes electricity…”\n   → click Next (slide ‘Solar = Light → Electricity’).\n\nTiming: 3 minutes total.\n\nSolar Energy = Light → Electricity\nPhoton hits → electron flows ⇢ DC current  \nFactory flashes 1 ms to verify panel power\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes (≈2 min):\nOrient to the diagram\u000b “Here’s our stylized solar cell. See the junction in the middle between the P-type layer (on the right) and the N-type layer (on the left)? That’s where the magic happens.”\u000b\nExplain the photoelectric effect\u000b “When a photon—one packet of light—strikes that PN-junction, it gives an electron enough energy to jump from the P-side into the N-side. That movement of electrons is a direct current (DC) we can harness.”\u000b\nLocal context tie-in\u000b “Because rooftops in Mosul can hit 49 °C, real panels lose up to 14 % of their power compared to lab conditions. So, in the factory they flash each panel for just 1 ms under a xenon lamp to confirm it really meets its rated output before it ever sees our heat.”\u000b\nPop-corn Q1\u000b “Who can point out where the P-layer sits? … Yes, the right side—exactly.”\u000b Follow-up: “Why does knowing that orientation matter when we connect many cells in series for high voltage?”\u000b (Take one quick answer, then affirm.)\u000b\nSegue to the demo\u000b “It might look a lot like an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor)—both respond to light. But an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) only controls current; a solar cell actually creates it. On the next slide, we’ll prove that difference with our Night-Light mini-demo.”\n\nMini Demo: Night-Light Circuit\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nAdditional Activity – Mini Demo: Night-Light Circuit\n💡 Goal: Show that an LDR only controls electricity based on light levels — it does not generate electricity like a solar cell.\nMaterials:\n1 × LDR\n1 × LED\n1 × Transistor (e.g., BC547)\n2 × Resistors (10kΩ and 330Ω)\nBreadboard + jumper wires\n9V battery + clip\nSimple Logic:\nFrom the circuit:\u000bLess light → LDR resistance increases → LED turns ON\u000bMore light → LDR resistance decreases → LED turns OFF\nSteps:\nShow the physical LDR and LED to the class.\nCover the LDR → LED should turn ON.\nShine light on the LDR → LED should turn OFF.\nFacilitator notes:\n\"Let’s observe: this LDR can turn on a light when it’s dark — but it does not generate electricity like a solar cell does.\"\n\"This is important: the solar cell produces power, but the LDR only controls power flow.\"\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n\nMeet the Core Components\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n*Design: Photo collage:\n\nLongi 600 W panel on stand\n\n5 kW hybrid inverter (lid closed)\n\nBYD 5 kWh Li-battery\nFacilitator notes (≈1 minute):\n“Let’s meet the heart of every solar setup.”\n[Point to panel photo]\nSolar panel – here’s a 600 W Longi module. In broad daylight it converts sunlight directly into DC electricity. Its job is to capture as much sun as possible.\n[Move pointer to inverter]\nHybrid inverter, 5 kW capacity. It takes that DC electricity from the panels and any battery, then turns it into AC for your home—or sends excess back to the grid. On Day 2 you’ll tear one open and spot the differences between a cheap knock-off and a premium unit.\n[Finally, indicate the battery]\nLi-ion battery, 5 kWh BYD pack. It stores surplus energy so you’ve got power when the sun sets or the grid fails. We’ll test its health, measure temperature limits, and learn why a proper BMS is non-negotiable.\nWrap-up: “Between them—the panel, inverter, and battery—they handle 90 % of system performance. Over the next five days you’ll not only install each component but also become fluent explaining their specs and selling their value to customers.”\nTransition: “With these in mind, let’s check how they must interconnect… On the next slide, you’ll see the Compatibility Mind-Map that ties them all together.”\n\nCompatibility Mind-Map\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes (≈1 minute):\n“Here’s our Compatibility Mind-Map—think of it as the rulebook for assembling a safe, reliable solar system.\n[Point at central blue node]\u000b At the center is ’System Integration’—everything ties back to making these parts work as one.\nYellow branches: Panel ↔ Inverter\nVoltage range: Your panel’s Voc and Vmp must sit within the inverter’s maximum DC input (e.g., 500 V max).\nPower matching: Don’t oversize panels so much that you waste energy in clipping—or undersize and starve your loads.\u000b\nGreen branches: Inverter ↔ Battery\nBattery voltage: The inverter expects a specific battery bus (e.g., 48 V). Mismatches here will prevent charging or even damage the inverter.\nC-rate & current limits: Ensure the battery can safely deliver and receive the inverter’s power without overheating or undue stress.\nPurple branches: System-Wide Rules\nCable sizing & fusing: Always apply the 1.25× safety factor, choose the right conductor, and install DC-rated fuses close to the battery.\nEnvironmental protection: Dust, heat, and moisture can degrade performance—select IP ratings, derate for temperature, and plan for regular cleaning.\n\nAhmed – Coffee-Shop Owner \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nFact\nDetail\nCritical appliance \nItalian coffee machine – 1 800 W\nCurrent supply\n15 A diesel generator @ 12 000 IQD/A\nPain point\nPower cuts ruin coffee & sales\nGoal \nWants reliable solar but fears up-front cost\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nHook (10s)\u000b “Now let me introduce you to someone just like your future customers: Ahmed runs a small street-side coffee shop here in Mosul.”\u000b\nWalk through the data (40s)\n“Fact: He uses a 1 800 W Italian espresso machine every day.”\n“Current Supply: He powers it with a 15 A diesel generator at 12 000 IQD per amp – that’s 180 000 IQD each month just to keep coffee flowing.”\n“Pain Points: When the grid cuts out or the generator fails, he loses sales. He pays sky-high fuel costs, and on his dusty, scorching rooftop, panel cleaning is a nightmare.”\n“Goal: He’s desperate for reliable solar—but the upfront cost makes him hesitate.”\u000b\nTeam activity (3 min)\u000b “In your table teams, write down one additional data point you’d need to design Ahmed’s system. Maybe it’s his shop’s daily hours of operation, roof dimensions, or peak customer load. You have three minutes—go!”\u000b\nClose & tie-in (10s)\u000b “Fantastic—thank you! We’ll pin your notes up here, and at 15:30, you’ll plug Ahmed’s numbers into your Baseline ROI worksheet to see if solar makes sense for him.”\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n\nKey Definitions\nDay 1\nTerm\nDefinition\nFunction / Why It Matters\nVoc\nOpen-circuit voltage\nMaximum voltage a panel can produce; must stay below inverter input limits\nIsc\nShort-circuit current\nMaximum current when panel leads are shorted; guides fuse sizing and cable ampacity\nTemp-coef\nTemperature coefficient (e.g. –0.35 %/°C)\nRate at which panel power changes with cell temperature; critical for hot climates like Mosul to predict real output\nAzimuth\nEast-/West offset (° from true south)\nOrientation of array relative to south; affects seasonal yield\nTilt (β)\nAngle between panel surface and horizontal plane\nControls how directly sunlight strikes panel; optimized per latitude to maximize annual energy\nPeak-Sun-Hour\nEquivalent full-sun hours per day (kWh/m²/day)\nSimplifies irradiation into a single daily value; multiply by system kWp to estimate daily kWh production\nkWh ↔ Amp\nEnergy (kWh) = (Amps × Volts × Hours) ÷ 1000\nQuick conversion to size loads and calculate cost: if you know a device’s current draw, you can turn it into daily energy consumption\nFacilitator note: \n“Before we touch any hardware, let’s lock down seven key terms you’ll see on datasheets and in calculations today. Think of these as your solar-survival kit.”\nVoc (Open-circuit voltage):\u000b “This is the maximum voltage your panel can spit out when nothing’s hooked up. It’s critical because your inverter has a voltage ceiling—stay below it or you risk damage.”\nIsc (Short-circuit current):\u000b “This is the peak current if you directly short the panel leads. We never actually do that—except in testing—but it tells us how big of a fuse and cable we need to keep everything safe.”\nTemp-coef (Temperature coefficient):\u000b “Panels lose power as they heat up. A typical value is –0.35 % per °C, so on a 60 °C roof you might be 7 % down just from heat. In Mosul, that adds up fast—always factor it in.”\nAzimuth (East/West offset):\u000b “Azimuth tells us which way the panels face: 0° is true south, –90° is east, +90° is west. Even a 15° error can cost you a few percent of annual energy.”\nTilt (β):\u000b “That’s the angle from horizontal—think of it like tilting your panel to chase the sun. At our latitude we use around 30°, but small tweaks bump up winter versus summer yield.”\nPeak-Sun-Hour:\u000b “This compresses sun intensity into ‘hours of full sun per day.’ If Mosul averages 5 kWh/m²/day, one kWp of panels makes about 5 kWh each day.”\nkWh ↔ Amp conversion:\u000b “To turn a device’s current draw into energy: Amps × Volts × Hours ÷ 1000 = kWh. You’ll use this to fill in our workbook and calculate real-world costs.”\n“Write to your note—or even snap a photo—because you’ll refer to these definitions every time we read datasheets or run numbers.”\n\nDatasheet Quick-Read\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nSpec\nValue\nWhy It Matters\nVoc\n____ V\nPanel < inverter max to be compatible with the inverter\nIsc\n____ A\nfuse + cable sizing\nTemp-coef\n____ % / °C\nChanges in efficiency based on heat\nDay 1\nFind and note:\nMaterials to print & prep (before class): one copy of each panel’s datasheet (Longi vs cheap), A4 size. (If this activity is not possible, we can remove it)\n\nFacilitator notes (≈ 3 min total):\n1. Setup reminder (30 s):\n“Okay everyone, please take the printed datasheet at your table—one for the premium Longi panel, one for the low-quality panel. You’ll need pens.”\n\n2. Explain the task (30 s):\n“On each sheet you’ll find a sea of numbers. Our goal in the field is to spot three key specs in under a minute. Today those are:\n  • Voc: the panel’s open-circuit voltage (think of it as the “pressure” it can build when nothing’s attached).\n  • Isc: the short-circuit current (the maximum “flow” if you directly connect the leads).\n  • Temp-coef: how much power changes with temperature (for example, –0.35 % per °C, so panels lose a bit of output when they get hot).”\n\n3. Analogy (30 s):\n“Imagine Voc is like the highest pressure in a water hose when the nozzle is closed. Isc is the flood of water if you remove the nozzle completely. Temp-coef is how much that water flow drops when the hose gets hot in the sun.”\n\n4. Countdown & roam (30 s + 1 min):\n“Ready? I’ll set a timer for 2 minutes—find Voc, Isc, and Temp-coef on both sheets, write them down in the margin. Go!”\n\n5. Wrap-up (30 s):\nAfter timer → “Stop! Great job. This quick-scan skill lets you compare two panels in seconds—crucial when you’re on someone’s roof and they’re waiting.”\n\nComponent Stations — Setup\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nComponent Stations - Pre-Setup Checklist\n📋 Trainer Preparation\nStation 1: Panel Comparison\nEquipment Needed:\n1 premium solar panel\n1 low-quality solar panel\nStation folder with:\n✅ Panel datasheets (premium vs cheap) - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Comparison checklist (EN + AR) - printed\nStation 2: Inverter Teardown\nEquipment Needed:\n1 genuine inverter\n1 refurbished inverter\nStation folder with:\n✅ Inverter datasheets (both units) - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Teardown checklist - printed\n✅ Safety glasses for each participant\nStation 3: Battery Health Check\nEquipment Needed:\nReal battery sample\nFake/refurbished battery sample\n1 clamp meter\nStation folder with:\n✅ Battery specification sheets - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Health check procedure (AR/EN) - printed\nStation 4: MC4 Crimp & Test\nEquipment Needed:\nMC4 crimp tools\nMC4 connector pairs\n1 multimeter (polarity test)\nSafety gloves\nStation folder with:\n✅ MC4 connector specifications - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Crimp procedure checklist - printed\n✅ Polarity test instructions - printed\n⚠️ Trainer Note: Each station must have complete printed materials before participants arrive.

Time’s up!\u000b We’re going to close the loop between what we just did and our Compatibility Mind-Map theory.\nHere’s how it works: I’d like one volunteer from each team to come up and choose a single measurement you recorded at your station—maybe Voc = 38 V or I<sub>SC</sub> = 9.2 A. Write that number in the Your Number column on the board.\nAs soon as it’s up, I’ll circle it and point out which Mind-Map Rule it matches.

Just like yesterday, we’ve organized them into our Learn–Apply–Sell rhythm:\nLEARN:\nExplain DC ≠ AC fuses; recall lock-out rule – by mid-morning you’ll understand why you can’t swap AC breakers for DC, and you’ll be able to run our zero-injury lock-out/tag-out ritual flawlessly.\nSpot heatsink, internal fuse & BMS in premium gear – you’ll break down real inverters and batteries under the doc-cam and point out the build-quality features that earn customer trust.\nCalculate 10-year cost & pay-back (cheap vs premium) – in theory, you’ll model total cost of ownership over a decade and identify when the ‘premium’ option starts saving money.\u000b\nAPPLY:\u000b 4. Measure surface temp; choose placement < 35 °C – you’ll use an IR gun to log battery casing temperatures and decide the safest mounting location.\u000b 5. Strip, crimp, torque 18 Nm; test breaker trip < 1 s – at our hands-on stations, you’ll size and crimp MC4 cables, torque M8 bolts, and verify a DC breaker clears in under one second.\nSELL:\u000b 6. Use ROI + real warranty to handle price objection – at the end of the day you’ll draw on your cost models and warranty red-flags to craft a persuasive response when a customer balks at higher upfront costs.\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n\nSafety Deep-Dive\n⚠️ Battery gas-vent\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\nFacilitator notes:\nSet the scene (10 s):\u000b “This clip shows what happens when a lithium battery goes into thermal runaway—when cells overheat and vent violently.”\u000b\nPlay the video (2 min):\u000b – Ask everyone to watch closely—no commentary until it ends.\u000b\nDebrief & discussion (45 s):\u000b “What did you notice? (Pause for 2–3 quick observations: smoke, heat, pressure.)”\u000b\nKey teaching points (45 s):\nCause: “Most thermal runaways start when the BMS fails to cut charge/discharge during a fault or extreme temperature.”\nWarning signs: “Swollen case, hissing, heat—if you see these, isolate immediately.”\nPrevention: “A robust BMS board, proper ventilation, and real-time temperature monitoring keep cells safe.”\u000b\nTie back to today’s objectives (20 s):\u000b “Later, you’ll measure surface temps with an IR gun and choose a location that stays below 35 °C—so you never trigger this in the field.”\n\nSafety Deep-Dive\n⚠️ DC fuse ≠ AC fuse (not the same wires), and Circuit breakers.\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\nFacilitator notes:\nIntroduce the demo (15 s):\u000b “Next, we’ll see why DC fuses and AC breakers are not interchangeable.”\u000b\nPhysical props (15 s):\u000b “Here’s an AC breaker (show) and a DC-rated fuse (show). Notice the wire sizes, contacts, and breaking-capacity labels.”\u000b\nLive spark demo (1 min):\u000b – Safely create a short on each device:\nAC breaker: Arc stops at the AC zero crossing—spark is brief.\nDC fuse: Arc persists until the fuse element melts—much longer, hotter spark.\u000b – Narration: “AC arcs extinguish 120× per second; DC arcs don’t—so you need special contacts and arc-chutes.”\u000b\nHands-on grouping activity (2 min):\nPass around a mix of fuses and breakers.\n“Quickly sort these into ‘AC use’ and ‘DC use’ piles.”\u000b\nDiscussion & lessons (1 min 30 s):\n“Why can’t you substitute one for the other?” (Expect: arc suppression, contact materials.)\n“What can go wrong if you use an AC breaker on a DC string?” (Expect: permanent arcing, fire hazard.)\nReal story tie-in: “I spoke with a solar technician who had his field DC breaker weld shut—he lost six hours of work waiting for replacement.”\n\nSafety Deep-Dive\n⚠️ Never short a lithium pack!\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\nFacilitator notes:\nShow the photo (10 s):\u000b “Here’s what happens when polarity or a short catches you by surprise.”\u000b\nPrompt observations (20 s):\u000b “What do you see? (Wait for answers: melted metal, black carbon, deformation.)”\u000b\nExplain root causes (30 s):\nReverse polarity: “Swapping positive/negative during commissioning can create a dead-short through your tool.”\nLive feed backfeed: “If your inverter is still live and you open an MC4 connector without isolating, it can arc through your screwdriver.”\nUnexpected stored energy: “Capacitors inside inverters or PV combiner boxes hold charge—touching them is like touching a live battery.”\u000b\nGather participant insights (30 s):\u000b “Has anyone seen or heard of a similar near-miss or surprise arc? What happened, and how could it have been prevented?”\u000b\nReinforce safety ritual (30 s):\n“Always isolate the DC string at the breaker before touching any live connector.”\n“Verify zero volts at the panel leads and at the inverter input—twice.”\n“Use insulated tools rated for DC work and keep a clear buddy-check process.”\n\nWhy Teardown Matters?\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\nWhy Compare Cheap vs. Premium Inverters?\n\nExpose Construction Differences: See why low-cost units overheat and fail fast. ⚙️\nLink Build Quality to Field Performance: Translate small heatsinks, missing fuses, thin copper → real downtime in Mosul’s heat and dust. 🔥\nArm Your Sales Pitch: “I’ve physically seen that premium inverters include DC-rated fuses and heavy finned heat sinks—here’s why that saves money long term.” 💬\nFacilitator notes: \n“Before we crack anything open, let’s be clear why we’re doing this. \nFirst, you’ll see the mechanical shortcuts cheap inverters take—tiny heatsinks, no DC fuse, flimsy copper—which in our 50 °C rooftop and dusty air means burnout and broken promises. \nSecond, every feature you spot feeds our Sell block: you’ll tell customers ‘I tested both—only the premium keeps cool and protected.’ \nFinally, missing DC-rated protection is a safety hazard. So this isn’t just a technical demo, it’s the backbone of your future value proposition.”\n\nTeardown Setup\nDemo Steps\n\nRemove Top Cover (4 screws)\nCompare Interiors\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Two high-resolution photos side-by-side:\nLeft: Cheap/refurbished inverter interior\nRight: Premium unit interior\nFacilitator notes:\nSetup (30 s):\u000b “I’ve already loosened the four screws on each inverter. Now we’ll remove both lids at once—no camera needed. Please handle them gently.”\nDistribute Units (15 s):\u000b “I’ll hand each pair one cheap unit and one premium unit. Ensure they’re fully powered off and sitting flat on your table.”\nTeams Inspect (2 min):\u000b “In your pairs, lean in and examine the two photos on screen and the actual interiors in your hands. Notice features like heatsink size, fuse presence, and copper track thickness. Feel free to pass the units around so everyone gets a close look.”\nTransition Prompt (15 s):\u000b “Great—after two minutes, we’ll move to the next slide, where you’ll list your findings under Cheap 👎 and Premium 👍. Be ready to share your top three differences.”\n(Start a 2-minute timer. When time’s up, say:)\u000b “Time’s up!

In 2 minutes, work with your table to spot and list:\nThree the differences you see for the Cheap 👎 inverter and the Premium 👍 inverter”\u000b\nWhat to Look For\u000b “Focus on details like:\nHeatsink size and material thickness\nPresence (or absence) of an internal DC fuse\nThickness of copper busbars on the PCB\nSolder joint quality (neat vs. patchy)\nAny coatings, seals, or protective barriers”\u000b\nCirculate & Coach\u000b “I’ll walk around to help if you get stuck. Jot down your observations quickly—these details are exactly what your customers will ask about when you recommend a premium model.”\u000b\nDebrief (after 2 min)\u000b “Time’s up—let’s hear one example from each side:\nWho noticed a missing fuse or a tiny heatsink on the cheap unit?\nWho saw the robust fins or secure solder joints on the premium unit?\u000b\nAs you share, think about how highlighting these differences builds trust with a customer: fewer breakdowns, safer operation, and lower lifetime cost.”\n\nInverter Tear-Down \nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nCheap 👎\nTiny heatsink\nNo internal fuse\nThin PCB tracks\n…\nPremium 👍\nLarge heatsink\nProper DC fuse\nThick copper bus\n…\nFacilitator notes:\nReintroduce the Exercise\u000b “Great work on spotting build-quality clues! You’ve just completed our side-by-side comparison of a cheap/refurbished inverter versus a premium unit.”\u000b\nReview Cheap-Unit Weaknesses\nTiny heatsink: “Less metal surface area means poorer heat dissipation—under Mosul’s 49 °C rooftop, this unit will overheat sooner.”\nNo internal DC fuse: “Without a built-in fuse, a fault current can flow unchecked, risking fire or inverter damage.”\nThin PCB copper tracks: “Thin copper increases resistance and heat under load—another reliability risk.”\nEtc….\u000b\nReview Premium-Unit Strengths\nLarge, finned aluminum heatsink: “Maximizes heat rejection, keeping components cooler and extending lifespan.”\nProperly rated internal DC fuse: “Catches faults quickly and safely, protecting both inverter and downstream wiring.”\nThick copper busbars on PCB: “Handles high currents with minimal voltage drop and heat buildup.”\nEtc…\u000b\nWhy These Matter\u000b “Each of these differences translates directly into fewer breakdowns, lower maintenance costs, and a stronger sales argument: you can promise your clients real reliability, not just a low price tag.”\u000b\nLink Back to Mind-Map & Sell Block\u000b “Remember our Compatibility Mind-Map’s purple branch on environmental protection and system reliability—these premium features check every box. Later, when you ‘sell’ a hybrid system, calling out these build-quality advantages will help you earn trust and justify the value premium price.”\u000b\nTransition\u000b “With inverter quality clearly differentiated, we’ll move on to our next Learn segment: Cable-Sizing Math—so you know how to match cables and fuses to real currents safely. Let’s go!”\n\nBattery Reality Check\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\nFake / Refurb 👎\nNo BMS board\nRe-painted case\nCells mismatched\nGenuine Li-ion👍\nBMS present\nManufacturer stamp\nMatched cells\nPrep:\nBring two samples: 1) premium Li-ion battery opened (BMS visible), 2) old/refurbished battery without BMS.\nTake close-up photos for slides, but also show physical units in class.\nPrepare infrared camera and & mini thermometer gun (for temperature demo if time allows).\n(15 s) “Let’s see what’s inside two very different packs. On the left is a refurb job—notice the missing management electronics, painted-over shell, and uneven cells.”\n(45 s) “Without a BMS board, there’s no cell balancing, no over-charge or discharge protection: the pack can overheat or fail catastrophically. In Mosul’s heat, this risk multiplies.”\n(45 s) “On the right is the genuine BYD board” (point to BMS board image) “—you can clearly see the balance-resistor array, temp sensor, and factory logo. All cells are matched, giving predictable lifetime and safe operation.”\n(30 s) “Later, at Station B, you’ll also log surface temperature to keep these packs below 35 °C—another vital protection step.”\n(Advance to next slide.)\n\nBattery BMS Demo\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n* Design: Full-screen photo with call-outs like “BMS board,” “vent path,” and “cell tabs.”\nFacilitator notes:\nThermal Camera “Hot-Spot” Demo\nMaterials: A powered-up inexpensive 12 V Li-ion pack (if you have one), your IR gun/thermal camera, and a small 5 A load (e.g., a 5 Ω resistor bank or even a small bulb).\nActivity:\nConnect the battery to your load for 30 s.\nPoint the IR camera at the cell seams and BMS area. Watch for any hot-spots.\nEmphasize: “Without a proper BMS, cells can overheat unevenly, leading to venting or fire.”\nGroup Discussion “What If?”\nAsk: “What happens if a pack has no BMS and a single cell goes over-charge?”\nLet 2–3 participants shout out answers (thermal runaway, puffing case, lost cycle life).\nTrainer adds: “In real installs, a failed cell can vent flammable gas under your roof—so always specify a pack with a certified BMS and vent channel.”\nLink Back to Safety Ritual\nPoint to your lock-out/tag-out rules: “If a battery pack vents, you need immediate isolation and a buddy-observer to make sure everyone steps back.”\n\nCable & Breaker Sizing\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n25 % rule: cable ampacity ≥ 1.25 × load\n🔵 4 mm²\n🟢 6 mm²\n🟠 10 mm²\nRotary DC isolator before opening MC4\nCable CSA (mm²)\nAmpacity (A)\nBreaker (A)\n4 mm²\n22 – 30\n20\n6 mm²\n30 – 39\n30\n10 mm²\n39 – 54\n40\nFacilitator notes:\nIntroduce the Rule (30 s)\u000b “In hot, dusty rooftops like Mosul’s, we ’over-size’ cable by 25 % to avoid overheating and voltage drop. That means our cable ampacity must be at least 1.25 × the load current.”\u000b\nWalk Through an Example (1 min)\u000b “Say you measured a pump drawing 12 A.\u000b 12 A × 1.25 = 15 A required.\u000b Look up 15 A in our table → that falls in the 22 – 30 A range of a 4 mm² cable.\u000b Then select a fuse or breaker rating ≥ 20 A (the next standard size).”\u000b\nShow the Table (1 min)\u000b “Here’s our quick reference. Notice how each cable cross-section (4, 6, 10 mm²) has a matching ampacity range and a recommended breaker size. Always pick the breaker equal to or above the cable’s max ampacity.”\u000b\nPoint Out Cable Samples (30 s)\u000b “We have real samples here: blue for 4 mm², green for 6 mm², orange for 10 mm². Hold up the 4 mm² sample—see how thin it is compared to 10 mm²? That difference is why ampacity jumps from 30 A to 54 A.”\u000b\nQuick Check (1 min)\u000b “If your load doubles to 24 A, what cable and fuse would you choose?”\u000b [Wait for answer: 24 A×1.25 = 30 A → 6 mm² cable, 30 A breaker]\u000b “Exactly. That’s your Station C task in a few minutes—apply this rule with your own measured currents.”\u000b\nTransition (15 s)\u000b “With cable and breaker sizing locked down, you’ll head to Station C to pick the right cable gauge and test a pull-force. Then we’ll move into our Apply block to practice crimping and isolation under live conditions.”\n\nCable & Breaker Sizing\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n\nCable & Breaker Sizing\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n\n🍴 LUNCH\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n\nStation Checklist\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\nFacilitator notes:\n“Now we launch into our Apply block: four quality-check stations. You’ll spend 20 minutes at each, then the whistle calls rotation.

Under-torque and the next big gust will loosen your rails, risking misalignment and damage.\nHands-on tip: When you hear that “click,” stop turning—over-torque can strip threads. Next up, we’ll quiz you on tilt and azimuth before we head onto rooftop checks.”\n\nTilt & Orientation\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nTilt & Orientation: PV module tilt is the angle between the panel and the ground. Solar panels work best when sunlight hits them directly. Optimal tilt depends on location and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is 32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best orientation.\nFacilitator notes:\n[Expert stands front, pointer in hand]\u000b “Okay, team—let’s talk about tilt and azimuth.\n‘Tilt’ is just how much you tip your panel up from flat ground. If it’s too flat, you miss low-angle winter sun; too steep, you lose high summer sun. In Mosul we aim for 32 to 36 degrees—that balance gives us the most energy year-round.\n‘Azimuth’ means the compass direction the panel faces. 0 degrees is true south, which gets the highest sun all day. A few degrees east or west are okay, but aim as close to south as you can.\n\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other structures can block sunlight from reaching solar panels. Even partial shading significantly reduces power output, as the entire string performance drops to that of the shaded panel. To maximize energy production year-round, it's important to avoid shaded spots when installing solar panels.\nFacilitator notes:\n[Expert gestures to shaded panel photo]\u000b “Next up: shading. This is a solar killer.\nAny time a bit of your panel is shaded, the whole string of panels drops in power—like a traffic jam on your roof.\nSee that tree branch on the right? That tiny stripe of shade can cost you 20 to 30 percent of your daily energy.\n\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\nWhat is the peak load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\nWhat is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\nHow many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries without other input sources?)\nIs there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\nWhat is the layout of the roof? Include equipment, shading obstacles, or barriers affecting solar installation.\nWhat is the direction of true south?\nWhat are the building’s operating hours?\nHow many days per week is the building operational?\nWhat type of building is it? (Residential, commercial, or industrial)\nAre there any shading risks? (e.g., trees or nearby buildings)\nAny additional information?\nFacilitator notes: \n[Expert moves to center, makes eye contact]\u000b “Here’s your Field Survey Checklist—twelve key questions you always ask on any new rooftop. Today, we’ll practice using it.\nActivity Instructions:\nI need you in your teams to choose one nearby roof—your house, or the building next door.\nTake five minutes to answer the first six questions on the left in jot-form on a sticky note:\nPeak and average amps, future growth, grid availability, system type, and battery autonomy.\nAlso note any shading obstacles you spot—trees, pipes, walls.\u000b\nGo! I’ll set a timer for five minutes. After that, each team quickly shares one surprising thing you found.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nDust Loss in Mosul\n15 % drop after 4 weeks without cleaning\nWeekly wipe → > 95 % performance\nDesign\n* Photo of dusty panel being swept\n*Mini bar-chart contrasting “Clean” vs. “Dusty” panel output\nFacilitator notes (2 mins):\nIntroduction (15 s)\u000b “Let’s talk about what really happens when panels sit unclean on a Mosul rooftop.”\u000b\nDust Impact Story (30 s)\u000b “Local field measurements show that in just four weeks of normal desert dust accumulation, a panel’s energy output drops by about 15 percent. That’s almost one-sixth of your daily yield gone, simply because the sun can’t penetrate the dirt.”\u000b\nBar-Chart Walkthrough (20 s)\u000b “Here on the left, the ‘Clean’ bar represents the full 100 percent rated output. Next to it, the ‘Dusty’ bar falls to roughly 85 percent—a tangible loss that erodes your ROI faster every month.”\u000b\nMaintenance Solution (30 s)\u000b “The good news? A weekly wipe restores the panel back to over 95 percent of its original performance. That’s only a 5 percent drop versus 15 percent if you wait a month.”\u000b\nCustomer Pitch Tease (25 s)\u000b “This data underpins our maintenance-service offer. In our ‘Sell’ block later, you’ll see how to turn a 5 percent performance guarantee into a compelling subscription package for homeowners and businesses. Imagine promising ‘Less than one day of dust loss per week—guaranteed,’ and backing it with hard numbers.”\u000b\nTransition (10 s)\u000b “Next, we’ll move into our Frame & Torque checklist—because after we agree on cleaning frequency, we must ensure the hardware stays tight and secure against Mosul’s winds.”\n\n\nHaykal Mounting Frame – Key Checks\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nKit frame (bolt-together) vs welded steel  \nTorque spec 18 Nm \nMust resist wind-load ≥ 1.5 kN/m² on Mosul roofs\nFacilitator notes:\nFrame Options (45 s)\u000b “On the left you see the bolt-together kit—quick to assemble with basic tools—and on the right a fully welded steel bracket. The kit is fastest on site; the welded frame can be stronger but costs more in labour.”\u000b\nTorque Spec (30 s)\u000b “Every M8 bolt must be tightened to 18 Nm—just like on your MC4 and rail-mount tasks. Under-torque risks loosening; over-torque can strip threads.”\u000b\nWind-Load Calculation (60 s)\u000b “Mosul’s design wind pressure is 1.5 kN/m², which translates to about 150 kgf per m² of panel area: \nF = Pressure × Area  \nF = 1 500 N/m² × 1 m² ≈ 1 500 N ≈ 150 kgf  \nThat’s why we limit rail spans to 1.5 m—to keep bending loads within safe limits—and why in Tab 3 of your workbook you’ll price extra brackets or gussets so your kit stays solid in a storm.”\u000b\nTransition to Apply (30 s)\u000b “Now let’s head to our framing station, where you’ll practice bolting the kit rails to a mock roof section, torque them to 18 Nm, and sketch where extra brackets go. Grab your torque wrench and Workbook Tab 3—let’s go!”\n\n\nPreview → Workbook Tab 3 & Cleaning-Service ROI\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nFacilitator notes:\n“Next, you’ll see exactly how those torque specs and wind-load limits feed into our cost models. On Tab 3 of your workbook, you’ll:\nList out your Material BOM and Labour hours,\nApply your mark-up to set the sale price,\nAnd finally run the Cleaning-Service ROI calculator to find the pay-back period in months.\u000b\nWe’ll dive into that in the Sell block—so for now, keep Tab 3 in mind and get ready to turn these technical checks into real numbers for your customer pitch.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nRooftop Hazards & PPE\n🪜 Ladder at 75°: “Set ladder at a 75° angle for stability.”\n\n🪢 Harness & Anchor: “Always wear a fall-arrest harness clipped to a certified anchor.”\n\n🥽🧤 Gloves & Goggles: “Insulated gloves and safety glasses on at all times.”\nFacilitator notes:\n“Okay team, before we climb any more roofs, let’s run through our rooftop safety essentials.”\n1. Ladder Angle (30 s)\u000b “First, the ladder. You see the 75° icon—why 75°? Too shallow and it slips out; too steep and it tips backward. To find 75°, stand with your toes at the ladder base, reach your arms straight out: your palms should just touch a rung. Practice that every time you set up.”\n2. Harness & Anchor (45 s)\u000b “Next, fall protection. Every one of you must wear a harness clipped to a certified anchor point. No exceptions. If you’re more than one step onto the roof, hook in before moving. The anchor must be rated for at least 5 kN—always inspect the hardware before use.”\n3. Insulated Gloves & Safety Glasses (30 s)\u000b “Finally, PPE. Even if you’re just tightening a bolt, insulated gloves protect you from unexpected live wires or sharp edges. Safety glasses shield your eyes from dust, flying debris, or cable snap-backs. Keep them on from the moment you step onto the roof.”\nQuick Check (15 s)\u000b “Popcorn style—shout out one rooftop hazard we haven’t covered yet!”\u000b (Wait for a response, e.g., hot surfaces, sun exposure.)\nTransition (10 s)\u000b “Great—keep these rules top of mind all day. Next up, we’ll move into our wind-load and torque block, where we’ll practice safe bolt-torquing on a mock frame.”\n\nFuse & Ground Rules\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nFuse on positive DC as close to battery as possible\nUse DC-rated breakers for combiner if > 4 strings\nGrounding and lightning rod ≥ 2 m, copper-clad 16 mm Ø. Target ≤ 5 Ω earth resistance (demo showed 12 Ω acceptable only for class)\nTest resistance ≤ 5 Ω (goal)\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s cover two non-negotiables in every hybrid PV system: DC fusing and earthing.”\n1) Battery-Positive Fuse (45 s):\u000b “Always install the first fuse on the positive DC cable right at the battery’s terminal. Why? If a short happens anywhere in the wiring, that fuse blows instantly and protects every meter of cable, every combiner box, and your inverter. No fuse here means your cable could catch fire or your battery pack could go into thermal runaway.”\n2) DC-Rated Breakers at Combiners (30 s):\u000b “When you have more than four panel strings feeding a combiner, swap the standard fuse for a DC-rated miniature breaker. DC arcs don’t self-extinguish as fast as AC arcs—so you need a breaker designed for DC interruption. Always check the label: it should say ‘DC’ or ‘PV use.’”\n3) Ground Rod Specs (30 s):\u000b “For your earth electrode, drive at least 2 meters of 16 mm-diameter copper-clad steel into the ground, as shown here. Copper-clad offers corrosion resistance, so your rod stays conductive for years.”\n4) Earth Resistance Target (30 s):\u000b “After driving the rod, measure ground-to-rod resistance. In class we saw 12 Ω, which is fine for a demo. But on a real rooftop or field installation, we aim for ≤ 5 Ω. Why? Lightning and surge currents will always seek the path of least resistance—so you want it going into the earth rod, not through your inverter or structure.”\nTransition to Demo (15 s):\u000b “Now that we understand the why and how, let’s head out and test our demo rod to see that 12 Ω reading in action.”\n\nEarthing Rod Mini-Demo\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nHammer 1 m rod  \nConnect tester – read Ω value on screen\nFacilitator notes:\n“Time for live verification—let’s test our earthing rod.”\n1) Safety First (15 s):\u000b “Before anyone swings, helmet, gloves, and work boots on. Check that no one is standing within the hammer’s arc.”\n2) Hammering the Rod (30 s):\u000b “Trainee, please drive that 1 m rod straight down until only about 10 cm protrudes. Keep it vertical—any tilt reduces contact area with the earth.”\n3) Connecting the Meter (30 s):\u000b “Now, clip one multimeter lead to the top of the rod clamp and the other to our reference stake. Set the meter to the ohms range.”\n4) Reading & Context (30 s):\u000b “We’re seeing 12 Ω. Remember, for a real rooftop you want ≤ 5 Ω—so you’d add water to the soil or drive a second rod nearby to lower the resistance.”\n5) Quick Q&A (15 s):\u000b “Why do you think soil moisture matters? … Exactly: water improves conductivity between the rod and surrounding earth.”\n6) Wrap-up & Transition (15 s):\u000b “Great work—now that you’ve seen how to measure earth resistance.”\n\n🍴 LUNCH\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n\nStation Checklist\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nStation 2\nDust-Loss Demo & Cleaning\nStation 1\n 4-Panel Roof-Rig Build\nStation 3\nShading & Orientation Mini-Survey\n4× Longi 600 W panels (or equivalent)\nHaykal metal frame kit for 4 panels (rails, legs, M8 bolts & nuts)\nTorque wrench set (pre-set to 18 Nm)\nM8 bolts/nuts (spare)\nDC cable 4 mm² (to simulate PV cabling)\nUNI-T Solar Panel Tester (ISC mode)\nFine sand (small tubs) + tray or tarp\nSoft brushes / microfiber cloths\nSticky-note pads & pens (for logging “before/after” ISC readings)\nCardboard “mini-house” prop\nDesk lamp(s) + extension cord\nProtractors & tape measures\nPrinted Tilt/Azimuth chart\nNote: All remaining items (inverters, batteries, MC4 tools, safety gear, etc.) are staged for Day 2 and will return in later modules.\n\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s walk the room—each station needs only its own subset of gear from our big materials list.”\u000b\nStation 1 (4-Panel Frame):\n“You should see four Longi panels, the Haykal frame kit, your torque wrenches set to 18 Nm, M8 bolts and a coil of 4 mm² cable.

Last month, our colleague Ali had an accident...\n[Tell Ali's story from interviews - emphasize the consequence]\n\nOur safety ritual - memorize this:\n1. ISOLATE - Open breaker, lock out, tag with your name\n2. VERIFY - Test zero volts with multimeter  \n3. PPE - Gloves and glasses always on\n4. BUDDY - Never work alone\n5. TOOLS - Only insulated tools for electrical work\n6. CLEAR - Shout 'CLEAR!' before reconnecting\n7. NO TOUCH - Never touch live DC strings\n\nLet's practice. [Volunteer] come lock out this breaker...\"\n```\n\n**Demo:** Walk through complete lock-out procedure\n\n## 09:40 - LEARN Block\n\n### Slide 9: Iraq Energy Reality\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Why are we here? Look at these numbers:\n- Generators: 380-450 IQD/kWh - expensive and dirty\n- Grid: 100-160 IQD/kWh - but only 8-12 hours daily\n- Solar potential: 3,000 sun-hours yearly in Mosul\n\nShow of hands - who ran their generator over 12 hours yesterday?\nThe sun is free and reliable. Let's capture it.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 10: Three Solar Set-Ups\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Three ways to go solar:\n\nOFF-GRID: Complete independence, needs batteries. Perfect for remote sites.\nPro: No grid fees. Con: High battery cost.\n\nON-GRID: Direct grid connection, no batteries. For stable grid areas.\nPro: Lowest cost. Con: No power when grid fails.\n\nHYBRID: Grid + batteries. Best for Mosul's reality.\nPro: Always have power. Con: More complex.\n\nWe focus on hybrid - it matches our context.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 11: Wall of Challenges\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Quick poll - who's measured roof heat over 45°C? \nWho paid over 15,000 IQD per amp last month?\n\n[Get 2 short stories - 30s each]\n\nThese four challenges - heat, dust, cost, faults - are exactly what we solve this week.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 12: Solar = Light → Electricity\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Here's the magic: photons hit the PN-junction, electrons jump, creating DC current.\n\nIn Mosul's 49°C heat, panels lose up to 14% power. That's why factories flash-test \neach panel for just 1 millisecond to verify output before shipping.\n\nPop quiz - where's the P-layer? [Point to diagram]\nRight! Now let's see how this differs from an LDR...\"\n```\n\n### Slide 13: Mini Demo - Night Light Circuit\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Watch this LDR circuit:\n- Cover LDR → LED turns ON\n- Shine light → LED turns OFF\n\nKey point: LDR controls electricity, solar cells CREATE it. \nBig difference! One needs power, one makes power.\"\n```\n\n**Demo Time:** 2 minutes with actual circuit\n\n## 10:00 - Component Introduction\n\n### Slide 14: LEARN Block Header\n*Quick transition slide*\n\n### Slide 15: Meet the Core Components\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Three heroes of every solar system:\n\nPANEL - This 600W Longi module converts sunlight to DC power. \nIts job: capture maximum sun.\n\nINVERTER - 5kW hybrid unit turns DC to AC for your home. \nTomorrow we'll tear one apart to see quality differences.\n\nBATTERY - 5kWh lithium pack stores surplus energy. \nPowers you when sun sets or grid fails.\n\nThese three handle 90% of system performance.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 16: Compatibility Mind-Map\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Think of this as your assembly rulebook:\n\nYELLOW branches - Panel to Inverter: \nVoltage must fit (panel Voc < inverter max input)\nPower matching prevents waste\n\nGREEN branches - Inverter to Battery:\nVoltage must match (48V system needs 48V battery)\nCurrent limits prevent overheating\n\nPURPLE branches - System-wide:\nCable sizing with 1.25× safety factor\nEnvironmental protection for Mosul conditions\n\nEverything connects - mess up one, system fails.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 17: Ahmed - Coffee Shop Owner\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Meet your first customer - Ahmed runs a street café:\n- Critical load: 1,800W espresso machine\n- Current cost: 15A generator at 180,000 IQD/month\n- Pain: Power cuts kill sales\n- Goal: Reliable solar but worried about upfront cost\n\nTable task (3 min): What's ONE data point you need to design his system? \nWrite it down - we'll use these at 3:30pm.\"\n```\n\n## 10:30 - APPLY Block Preparation\n\n### Slide 18: APPLY Block Header\n*Transition slide*\n\n### Slide 19: Key Definitions\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Before we touch hardware, lock down these seven terms:\n\nVoc - Maximum voltage when nothing's connected.

Super-quick recap:\n\nPop! What tool did you touch yesterday? [3 answers]\nEveryone shout ONE number! [Together]\nWhy never short lithium? [Answer: thermal runaway, fire]\n\nGreat! Let's see yesterday's best teams...\"\n```\n\n**Actions:**\n- Show fastest torque team photo - applause\n- Ask why dust costs money - get one clear answer\n\n### Slide 65: Yesterday's Questions\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE (4 min):**\n```\n\"Your top three questions from the wall:\n\nQ1: Can we use AC breakers temporarily for DC?\nA1: NEVER. DC arcs don't self-extinguish. Fire risk is real.\n\nQ2: How often should we torque-check bolts?\nA2: After 6 months, then annually. Wind loosens connections.\n\nQ3: What if ground resistance exceeds 5Ω?\nA3: Add water, drive second rod, or use chemical enhancement.\n\nReady for today's challenge?\"\n```\n\n### Slide 66: Ice-Breaker - Human Tilt-Line\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE (3 min):**\n```\n\"Everyone stand! You're human solar panels.\n\nRound 1: '0 degrees facing East!' [demonstrate flat, facing east]\nRound 2: '30 degrees facing South!' [lean forward, turn south]\nRound 3: 'Optimal Mosul winter tilt - shout the angle!'\n\nFirst table to yell '35 degrees!' wins cookies.\nThat 35° tilt maximizes winter production. Remember it!\"\n```\n\n## 09:10 - Daily Structure\n\n### Slide 67: Daily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n*Quick reminder - 30 seconds*\n\n### Slide 68: Day 1-5 Overview\n*Skip - reference only*\n\n### Slide 69: Day 3 Learning Objectives\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Today we become professional installers:\n\nLEARN: Cable sizing, wind loads, torque requirements\nAPPLY: Build a 4-panel rig, test dust impact\nSELL: Price installation service with cleaning package\n\nBy 5 PM, you'll install like a pro and sell the maintenance.\"\n```\n\n## 09:15 - LEARN Block\n\n### Slide 70: LEARN Header\n*Transition*\n\n### Slide 71: Wind-Load & Torque Logic\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE (3 min):**\n```\n\"Engineering formula: F = q × Cp × A\n\nIn Mosul: 35 m/s gusts create 1.5 kN/m² pressure.\nThat's 150 kg force pushing each square meter!\n\nEvery M8 bolt must click at exactly 18 Nm.\nUnder-torque = loosening in wind\nOver-torque = stripped threads\n\n[Demo torque wrench click]\nWhen you hear that click - STOP. No extra turns.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 72: Tilt & Orientation\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE (2 min):**\n```\n\"Two key angles:\n\nTILT: How much you tip up from flat ground\n- Too flat = miss winter sun\n- Too steep = lose summer sun\n- Mosul sweet spot: 32-36°\n\nAZIMUTH: Compass direction panel faces\n- 0° = true south (maximum daily sun)\n- Few degrees east/west OK\n- Beyond 15° = noticeable losses\n\nWrite these down - you'll apply them at stations.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 73: Shading Hazards\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Shading is a silent killer. Look at this photo...\n\nThat tiny tree branch shadow? Costs 20-30% power!\nWhy?

This is a 6-day, 70 % hands-on solar training. We start right now by meeting each other.”\n\nWhy Am I here?\nFacilitator notes:\nFacilitator:\u000b “Alright, everyone—let’s learn each other’s names and why we’re here today. We’re doing a sticky-note mingle.”\nStep 1: Write (30 s)\u000b “I’m going to pass out one coloured sticky-note and a pen to each of you. On your sticky, write one single word that best answers ‘Why I joined this solar training.’\nIt could be ‘energy’, ‘income’, ‘safety’, ‘future’, anything!\nKeep it short—just one word.”\n(Trainer walks around handing out sticky-notes and pens.)\n“Ready? Go—30 seconds!”\n(After ~30 s, trainer raises hand.)\u000b “Time!”\nStep 2: Mingle & Introduce (1 min 30 s)\u000b “Now, stand up, and find someone you don’t know. Swap sticky-notes: read their word and introduce your partner to your table in a quick 10-second popcorn burst.”\nPopcorn rule: when you’re ready, just call out someone’s name and toss them the “popcorn” to speak.\nExample pop: “Pop! John, tell us your word and why.”\n“Go! Mingle for 90 seconds.”\n(Trainer circulates, encourages quick popcorn calls at tables: “Pop! Aisha?” “Pop! Mahmoud?”)\nStep 3: Share & Sit (30 s)\u000b (After ~1 min 30 s, trainer claps hands.)\u000b “Awesome—have a seat! Let’s do quick popcorn on one word per table.”\nTrainer points to Table 1: “Pop! Table 1, who’s first?”\nA participant shares: “My word is………..”\nTrainer thanks them, then moves on: “Pop! Table 2?”\n“Great—now we know names and why we’re here. Let’s move on to our financial check-in.”\n\nGenerator Frustration → Solar Solution\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes (≈2 minutes)\nTransition from Sticky-Note Mingle\u000b “Great—now that we know why each of you joined, let’s see what our toughest daily headache looks like in real numbers.”\nPopcorn Share (20 s)\u000b “Pop! Who wants to shout out their worst generator story—noise at 3 AM, endless fuel smells, surprise breakdowns? Just one quick line.”\u000b (Allow 2–3 very rapid popcorn responses.)\nReveal the Bill (15 s)\u000b [Point to the photo and bill graphic]\u000b “This is an actual generator bill for a small café in Mosul: 500 000 IQD per month. That’s money burning away every 30 days.”\nQuick Math (20 s)\u000b “Let’s do the math together: 500 000 IQD × 12 = 6 000 000 IQD per year. Over just ten years, that’s 60 000 000 IQD—enough to buy multiple homes!”\u000b (Pause for effect.)\nSet up the Transition\u000b “We’re here today to put an end to that cycle. Solar can slash your energy cost—cleanly, quietly, forever. But to prove it, we need to link our technical skills with real money decisions.”\nSegue into Financial-Literacy Check-In\u000b “Next up: a 5-question check-in to see how you think about cash-flow, savings, and investments. We’ll come back on Day 5 and watch your answers change—just as our solar designs change these bills.”\nOn-Slide Timer\u000b (The bottom corner shows a 5:00 countdown for the quiz.)\u000b “Okay—take out your phones, scan the QR code on the next slide, and let’s begin our Financial-Literacy survey in 3…2…1… Go!”\n\nFinancial Literacy Pre-Quiz\nScan QR here\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nThe questions (will put on the Gform):\nIn one sentence, what does cash-flow mean to you?\nName one thing you save money for.\nIf you borrow 1 000 IQD at 5 % per month, how much do you repay after one month?\nList one variable expense in your home.\nHow could solar panels help your family budget?\nFacilitator notes:\nFacilitator (projecting QR on screen): “Okay everyone, next up is our Financial-Literacy Check-In. This will help us see where we all start—and we’ll repeat it on Day 5 to measure your progress.”\nExplain Purpose (30 s)\u000b “Solar isn’t just panels and wires—it’s also about return on investment, pay-back periods, and budgeting. So, we’ll do a quick 5-question survey right now. Don’t worry—there’s no grade, it’s just for you and to help me tailor the course.”\u000b\nGive Instructions (30 s)\u000b “Please take out your phone or device with internet.\u000b\nScan the big QR code on the screen.\nAnswer the 5 multiple-choice or short-answer questions.\nSubmit.”\u000b “If your connection is weak, please raise your hand now and I’ll pass you a paper copy—no problem.”\u000b\nStart the Timer (10 s)\u000b “I’m setting a 5-minute timer on the screen now. You’ll see it counting down.”\u000b\nMonitor & Assist (4 min 30 s)\u000b (Trainer walks around.)\u000b\n“Got your form open?”\n“Need a paper version?”\n“Any question on how to submit?”\u000b\nWarning at 1 Minute Left (10 s)\u000b (When timer hits 1:00)\u000b “One minute left, everyone—finish up your last answers and press Submit.”\u000b\nTime’s Up (10 s)\u000b (When timer ends)\u000b “Time! Please tap Submit now if you haven’t already.\u000b\nReassure & Transition (40 s)\u000b “Great job—that score is just for you. We’ll revisit it on Day 5 to see how much you’ve learned about managing project finances.\u000b Now, let’s move on to our first theory bridge: ‘Where Solar Fits in Iraq’.”\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nBefore we dive into today’s content, I want to show you the heartbeat of our entire training: the 3-Block Rhythm.\n📘 LEARN (First Block)\nWhat it is: A focused theory segment where we introduce concepts, review real data, and demo key techniques.\nWhy it matters: This gives you the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind every tool and calculation you’ll use.\nHow long: Roughly 45–60 minutes each morning.\n“In this block, feel free to ask questions—that’s exactly what it’s for.”\u000b\n🛠️ APPLY (Second Block)\nWhat it is: Hands-on practice. You’ll work in small teams at stations or on rigs, putting theory into action.\nWhy it matters: Muscle memory and real-world troubleshooting live here.\nHow long: 60–90 minutes, with a built-in rotation so you touch every station.\n“Here’s where mistakes are your best teachers—don’t be shy to try, fail fast, and ask for help.”\u000b\n💼 SELL (Third Block)\nWhat it is: A quick pitch, reflection, or mini-task where you frame what you’ve learned in a customer context: ROI pitches, service designs, troubleshooting reports.\nWhy it matters: Our end users—and many of your future clients—care about the numbers and the story.\nHow long: 30–45 minutes, wrapping up each day on a high-energy note.\n“This final block trains you to translate skills into value—and gives us a fun way to celebrate progress each day!”\u000b\nTransition Script:\u000b “Every day, we’ll follow this rhythm: Learn new theory, Apply it in the field, then Sell it back as a solution. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle—and you’ll use it in your design-competition finale. Ready to see it in action? Let’s switch to all of each day block rhythm”\n5\n\nDay 1-5 and Day 6 The Design Competition\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nLearn\nApply\nSell\nDay 1\nIntro to PV fundamentals \nComponent stations tour\nPanel & inverter hands-on\nLoad-audit workshop\n1-min ROI pitch video\nDay 2\nDeep dive: fuses & BMS\nDatasheet scavenger hunt\nWire-bench & breaker test\nBattery temp-log\nWarranty red-flag exercise\nDay 3\nCable sizing & torque logic\nFrame & wind loads\n4-panel roof-rig build\nDust-loss demo\nCleaning service pricing\nDay 4\nPVsyst simulation basics\nGrowth & shade analysis\nRoof plan editing\nCash-flow builder\nExpansion & service pitch\nDay 5\nTroubleshoot common faults\nFinal design sprint\nFault-hunt on mini-rig\nROI & margin wrap-up\nFinal 5-min pitch\nOptional Day 6\nDesign competition preparation\nDesign competition build-out\nWinner announcements\nFacilitator notes:\n“This is your roadmap for the week. Each day you’ll learn core theory, apply it hands-on, then sell your solution back to the class. Notice how the rhythm repeats—by Day 6 you’ll have integrated everything into a final design competition.”\n\nDay 1 Learning Objectives\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nLearn\nIdentify & handle real PV components\nRead key datasheet specs (Voc, Isc, temp-coef)\nApply\nCalculate household load in amps → kWh\nApply safety lock-out & DC rules\nSell\nCompare cost: generator vs solar (ROI)\nReflect & improve with daily feedback wall\nFacilitator notes:\n“Here are the six objectives for Day 1. The first two are Learn: by mid-morning you’ll be able to identify every PV component on the table and interpret Voc, Isc, and temperature coefficients from a datasheet.\nThen in Apply, you’ll calculate a real family’s load in amps and kilowatt-hours—and practice our zero-injury lock-out pledge on actual panels.\nFinally, in Sell, you’ll use those numbers to compare generator vs solar ROI and record a quick 1-minute pitch.\nFeel free to refer back to these as we go—each objective aligns to our Learn-Apply-Sell rhythm.”\n\nSafety First\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nGoal: 0 accidents all week\n(Share Ali’s story) \n⚠️ Isolate circuit — lock-out tag & padlock\n⚠️ Verify zero volts (DC first) with multimeter\n⚠️ Wear gloves & safety glasses\n⚠️ When work in electricity combine another person with you.\n⚠️ Use isolated tools while working in electricity.\n⚠️ One person shouts \"CLEAR!\" before reconnect\n⚠️ Never touch a live DC string\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nOpening Hook (30 s):\n“Before we jump in, I want to remind everyone why safety is non-negotiable. Last month, our colleague Ali got an accident with electricity because [the detailed story to be confirmed].”\n[Show a brief photo if available]\nLesson from Ali’s Story (45 s):\n“Ali admitted later that he needs to pay attention to [the detailed mistake to be confirmed].”\n“We don’t want ‘it always works’—we want zero incidents.”\nStep-by-Step Safety Ritual (1 min):\nIsolate: “First, open the breaker and hang the lock-out tag and padlock. That tag must read your name and time.”\nTest for Zero Volts: “Always grab your multimeter, set it to DC volts, and verify zero at both panel junction and inverter input.”\nPPE On: “Gloves and safety glasses stay on from start to finish—no exceptions.”\nBuddy System: “Never work alone. Your partner watches your back, hands you tools, and calls out if they see anything unsafe.”\nInsulated Tools: “Only use insulated screwdrivers, pliers, and cutters. Ordinary tools can turn into conductors.”\n“CLEAR!” Confirmation: “Before reconnecting, one person must shout ‘CLEAR!’ and everyone else must acknowledge. Only then do you switch the breaker back on.”\nHands Off Live DC: “Under no circumstances touch a live DC conductor. If you find voltage present, repeat steps 1–3.”\u000b\nReinforce & Model (45 s):\n“Let’s demo right now. Volunteer with me: please come lock out this breaker.”\n[Walk through the lock-out/tag-out procedure slowly, narrating each step: writing tag, locking padlock, testing multimeter, buddy confirmation, shout ‘CLEAR!’]\n“See how deliberate we are? This ritual is your daily habit—every single morning, before any hands-on work.”\u000b\nTransition to Next Topic (15 s): “Okay, with zero-injury top of mind, we’re ready to explore why Iraq’s energy mix drives us to solar. Let’s move on to how generators, grid, and sunshine fit into our story.”\n\nGrid 8-12 h, 100-160 IQD/kWh  \nGenerator 380-450 IQD/kWh  \nSolar ≈150 IQD/kWh)\nIraq Energy Reality\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n“Before we talk components, let’s ground ourselves in why we’re here: energy in Iraq.”\nDiesel Generators (30 s)\n“Right now, most homes and shops run on diesel generators.”\n“They cost 380 to 450 IQD per kilowatt-hour—that’s money straight out of your pocket. And they fill our air with smoke we all breathe.”\nQuick check-in: “By show of hands, who here has heard their generator run for more than 12 hours in one day?” (Pause for a few raised hands.)\nNational Grid (20 s)\n“The grid is cheaper—100 to 160 IQD/kWh—but only delivers power 8–12 hours a day, and the voltage wobbles so lights flicker and devices burn out. Not exactly reliable.”\nSunshine Potential (20 s)\n“Contrast that with 3 000 hours of sun every year in Mosul—more than 8 hours of sun daily on average. The sun is free, constant, and our best untapped resource.”\nSolar Cost Comparison (20 s)\nSolar Adoption (≈ 25 s)\nPoint to “< 5%”\n“Today solar makes up less than 5 percent of our energy mix.”\n“Yet with 3 000 sun-hours per year, the sun is our most reliable and pollution-free source.”\n“Yet each year, more people in Mosul are installing solar panels—adoption is rising fast”\n“And when you calculate all costs—hardware, installation, and maintenance—solar can already compete with grid rates, especially if you factor in the value of clean air.”\nTransition to Next Slide (15 s)\n“Now that we see why solar makes sense here, let’s look at the three main ways to set up a system—off-grid, on-grid, and hybrid.”\nClick to reveal “Three Solar Set-ups” slide.\n\nThree Solar Set-Ups\nOff Grid System\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nFacilitator notes:\nIntroduction (10 s)\n“Now that we’ve seen why solar makes sense in Mosul, let’s tour the three main system types.”\u000b\nOff-Grid Systems (25 s)\nPoint to OFF-GRID photo.\n“Off-grid systems run completely independent of the grid—panels, charge controller, inverter, battery all stand alone.\nUse case: Remote villages or telecom towers.\nPro: True energy independence, no grid fees.\nCon: Batteries cost a lot and need replacement.”\u000b\nOn-Grid Systems (25 s)\nPoint to ON-GRID photo.\n“On-grid systems hook directly to the utility—no batteries.\nUse case: Stable grid areas (e.g., government compounds in Baghdad).\nPro: Lowest upfront cost, you export surplus to the grid.\nCon: If the grid goes down, your solar shuts off too (anti-islanding), so no backup power.”\u000b\nHybrid Systems (25 s)\nPoint to HYBRID photo.\n“Hybrid systems blend the two: you stay tied to the grid and have battery backup.\nPro: You use solar when it’s available, draw from batteries during outages, and still export excess.\nCon: More complex equipment and higher cost—but this is the sweet spot for most Mosul homes, where outages are common but grid connection exists.”\u000b\nTransition (5 s)\n“In this training we’ll focus on hybrid designs, since they give the best reliability and ROI in our context.”\n\nWall of Challenges • 49 °C \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n1️⃣ Unveil the slide.\n\n2️⃣ Ask quick show-of-hands poll:\n   “Who here has measured rooftop heat over 45 °C?”  (Count.)\n   “Whose family paid > 15 k IQD per amp last month?” (Count.)\n\n3️⃣ Invite TWO learners (≤ 30 s each) to tell a short story:\n   • One about generator cost\n   • One about roof heat or dust\n\n4️⃣ React:\n   “These four pains are the market opportunity we’re tackling this week.”\n\n5️⃣ Segue:\n   “To solve them we first need to understand how light becomes electricity…”\n   → click Next (slide ‘Solar = Light → Electricity’).\n\nTiming: 3 minutes total.\n\nSolar Energy = Light → Electricity\nPhoton hits → electron flows ⇢ DC current  \nFactory flashes 1 ms to verify panel power\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes (≈2 min):\nOrient to the diagram\u000b “Here’s our stylized solar cell. See the junction in the middle between the P-type layer (on the right) and the N-type layer (on the left)? That’s where the magic happens.”\u000b\nExplain the photoelectric effect\u000b “When a photon—one packet of light—strikes that PN-junction, it gives an electron enough energy to jump from the P-side into the N-side. That movement of electrons is a direct current (DC) we can harness.”\u000b\nLocal context tie-in\u000b “Because rooftops in Mosul can hit 49 °C, real panels lose up to 14 % of their power compared to lab conditions. So, in the factory they flash each panel for just 1 ms under a xenon lamp to confirm it really meets its rated output before it ever sees our heat.”\u000b\nPop-corn Q1\u000b “Who can point out where the P-layer sits? … Yes, the right side—exactly.”\u000b Follow-up: “Why does knowing that orientation matter when we connect many cells in series for high voltage?”\u000b (Take one quick answer, then affirm.)\u000b\nSegue to the demo\u000b “It might look a lot like an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor)—both respond to light. But an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) only controls current; a solar cell actually creates it. On the next slide, we’ll prove that difference with our Night-Light mini-demo.”\n\nMini Demo: Night-Light Circuit\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nAdditional Activity – Mini Demo: Night-Light Circuit\n💡 Goal: Show that an LDR only controls electricity based on light levels — it does not generate electricity like a solar cell.\nMaterials:\n1 × LDR\n1 × LED\n1 × Transistor (e.g., BC547)\n2 × Resistors (10kΩ and 330Ω)\nBreadboard + jumper wires\n9V battery + clip\nSimple Logic:\nFrom the circuit:\u000bLess light → LDR resistance increases → LED turns ON\u000bMore light → LDR resistance decreases → LED turns OFF\nSteps:\nShow the physical LDR and LED to the class.\nCover the LDR → LED should turn ON.\nShine light on the LDR → LED should turn OFF.\nFacilitator notes:\n\"Let’s observe: this LDR can turn on a light when it’s dark — but it does not generate electricity like a solar cell does.\"\n\"This is important: the solar cell produces power, but the LDR only controls power flow.\"\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n\nMeet the Core Components\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n*Design: Photo collage:\n\nLongi 600 W panel on stand\n\n5 kW hybrid inverter (lid closed)\n\nBYD 5 kWh Li-battery\nFacilitator notes (≈1 minute):\n“Let’s meet the heart of every solar setup.”\n[Point to panel photo]\nSolar panel – here’s a 600 W Longi module. In broad daylight it converts sunlight directly into DC electricity. Its job is to capture as much sun as possible.\n[Move pointer to inverter]\nHybrid inverter, 5 kW capacity. It takes that DC electricity from the panels and any battery, then turns it into AC for your home—or sends excess back to the grid. On Day 2 you’ll tear one open and spot the differences between a cheap knock-off and a premium unit.\n[Finally, indicate the battery]\nLi-ion battery, 5 kWh BYD pack. It stores surplus energy so you’ve got power when the sun sets or the grid fails. We’ll test its health, measure temperature limits, and learn why a proper BMS is non-negotiable.\nWrap-up: “Between them—the panel, inverter, and battery—they handle 90 % of system performance. Over the next five days you’ll not only install each component but also become fluent explaining their specs and selling their value to customers.”\nTransition: “With these in mind, let’s check how they must interconnect… On the next slide, you’ll see the Compatibility Mind-Map that ties them all together.”\n\nCompatibility Mind-Map\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes (≈1 minute):\n“Here’s our Compatibility Mind-Map—think of it as the rulebook for assembling a safe, reliable solar system.\n[Point at central blue node]\u000b At the center is ’System Integration’—everything ties back to making these parts work as one.\nYellow branches: Panel ↔ Inverter\nVoltage range: Your panel’s Voc and Vmp must sit within the inverter’s maximum DC input (e.g., 500 V max).\nPower matching: Don’t oversize panels so much that you waste energy in clipping—or undersize and starve your loads.\u000b\nGreen branches: Inverter ↔ Battery\nBattery voltage: The inverter expects a specific battery bus (e.g., 48 V). Mismatches here will prevent charging or even damage the inverter.\nC-rate & current limits: Ensure the battery can safely deliver and receive the inverter’s power without overheating or undue stress.\nPurple branches: System-Wide Rules\nCable sizing & fusing: Always apply the 1.25× safety factor, choose the right conductor, and install DC-rated fuses close to the battery.\nEnvironmental protection: Dust, heat, and moisture can degrade performance—select IP ratings, derate for temperature, and plan for regular cleaning.\n\nAhmed – Coffee-Shop Owner \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nFact\nDetail\nCritical appliance \nItalian coffee machine – 1 800 W\nCurrent supply\n15 A diesel generator @ 12 000 IQD/A\nPain point\nPower cuts ruin coffee & sales\nGoal \nWants reliable solar but fears up-front cost\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nHook (10s)\u000b “Now let me introduce you to someone just like your future customers: Ahmed runs a small street-side coffee shop here in Mosul.”\u000b\nWalk through the data (40s)\n“Fact: He uses a 1 800 W Italian espresso machine every day.”\n“Current Supply: He powers it with a 15 A diesel generator at 12 000 IQD per amp – that’s 180 000 IQD each month just to keep coffee flowing.”\n“Pain Points: When the grid cuts out or the generator fails, he loses sales. He pays sky-high fuel costs, and on his dusty, scorching rooftop, panel cleaning is a nightmare.”\n“Goal: He’s desperate for reliable solar—but the upfront cost makes him hesitate.”\u000b\nTeam activity (3 min)\u000b “In your table teams, write down one additional data point you’d need to design Ahmed’s system. Maybe it’s his shop’s daily hours of operation, roof dimensions, or peak customer load. You have three minutes—go!”\u000b\nClose & tie-in (10s)\u000b “Fantastic—thank you! We’ll pin your notes up here, and at 15:30, you’ll plug Ahmed’s numbers into your Baseline ROI worksheet to see if solar makes sense for him.”\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n\nKey Definitions\nDay 1\nTerm\nDefinition\nFunction / Why It Matters\nVoc\nOpen-circuit voltage\nMaximum voltage a panel can produce; must stay below inverter input limits\nIsc\nShort-circuit current\nMaximum current when panel leads are shorted; guides fuse sizing and cable ampacity\nTemp-coef\nTemperature coefficient (e.g. –0.35 %/°C)\nRate at which panel power changes with cell temperature; critical for hot climates like Mosul to predict real output\nAzimuth\nEast-/West offset (° from true south)\nOrientation of array relative to south; affects seasonal yield\nTilt (β)\nAngle between panel surface and horizontal plane\nControls how directly sunlight strikes panel; optimized per latitude to maximize annual energy\nPeak-Sun-Hour\nEquivalent full-sun hours per day (kWh/m²/day)\nSimplifies irradiation into a single daily value; multiply by system kWp to estimate daily kWh production\nkWh ↔ Amp\nEnergy (kWh) = (Amps × Volts × Hours) ÷ 1000\nQuick conversion to size loads and calculate cost: if you know a device’s current draw, you can turn it into daily energy consumption\nFacilitator note: \n“Before we touch any hardware, let’s lock down seven key terms you’ll see on datasheets and in calculations today. Think of these as your solar-survival kit.”\nVoc (Open-circuit voltage):\u000b “This is the maximum voltage your panel can spit out when nothing’s hooked up. It’s critical because your inverter has a voltage ceiling—stay below it or you risk damage.”\nIsc (Short-circuit current):\u000b “This is the peak current if you directly short the panel leads. We never actually do that—except in testing—but it tells us how big of a fuse and cable we need to keep everything safe.”\nTemp-coef (Temperature coefficient):\u000b “Panels lose power as they heat up. A typical value is –0.35 % per °C, so on a 60 °C roof you might be 7 % down just from heat. In Mosul, that adds up fast—always factor it in.”\nAzimuth (East/West offset):\u000b “Azimuth tells us which way the panels face: 0° is true south, –90° is east, +90° is west. Even a 15° error can cost you a few percent of annual energy.”\nTilt (β):\u000b “That’s the angle from horizontal—think of it like tilting your panel to chase the sun. At our latitude we use around 30°, but small tweaks bump up winter versus summer yield.”\nPeak-Sun-Hour:\u000b “This compresses sun intensity into ‘hours of full sun per day.’ If Mosul averages 5 kWh/m²/day, one kWp of panels makes about 5 kWh each day.”\nkWh ↔ Amp conversion:\u000b “To turn a device’s current draw into energy: Amps × Volts × Hours ÷ 1000 = kWh. You’ll use this to fill in our workbook and calculate real-world costs.”\n“Write to your note—or even snap a photo—because you’ll refer to these definitions every time we read datasheets or run numbers.”\n\nDatasheet Quick-Read\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nSpec\nValue\nWhy It Matters\nVoc\n____ V\nPanel < inverter max to be compatible with the inverter\nIsc\n____ A\nfuse + cable sizing\nTemp-coef\n____ % / °C\nChanges in efficiency based on heat\nDay 1\nFind and note:\nMaterials to print & prep (before class): one copy of each panel’s datasheet (Longi vs cheap), A4 size. (If this activity is not possible, we can remove it)\n\nFacilitator notes (≈ 3 min total):\n1. Setup reminder (30 s):\n“Okay everyone, please take the printed datasheet at your table—one for the premium Longi panel, one for the low-quality panel. You’ll need pens.”\n\n2. Explain the task (30 s):\n“On each sheet you’ll find a sea of numbers. Our goal in the field is to spot three key specs in under a minute. Today those are:\n  • Voc: the panel’s open-circuit voltage (think of it as the “pressure” it can build when nothing’s attached).\n  • Isc: the short-circuit current (the maximum “flow” if you directly connect the leads).\n  • Temp-coef: how much power changes with temperature (for example, –0.35 % per °C, so panels lose a bit of output when they get hot).”\n\n3. Analogy (30 s):\n“Imagine Voc is like the highest pressure in a water hose when the nozzle is closed. Isc is the flood of water if you remove the nozzle completely. Temp-coef is how much that water flow drops when the hose gets hot in the sun.”\n\n4. Countdown & roam (30 s + 1 min):\n“Ready? I’ll set a timer for 2 minutes—find Voc, Isc, and Temp-coef on both sheets, write them down in the margin. Go!”\n\n5. Wrap-up (30 s):\nAfter timer → “Stop! Great job. This quick-scan skill lets you compare two panels in seconds—crucial when you’re on someone’s roof and they’re waiting.”\n\nComponent Stations — Setup\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nComponent Stations - Pre-Setup Checklist\n📋 Trainer Preparation\nStation 1: Panel Comparison\nEquipment Needed:\n1 premium solar panel\n1 low-quality solar panel\nStation folder with:\n✅ Panel datasheets (premium vs cheap) - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Comparison checklist (EN + AR) - printed\nStation 2: Inverter Teardown\nEquipment Needed:\n1 genuine inverter\n1 refurbished inverter\nStation folder with:\n✅ Inverter datasheets (both units) - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Teardown checklist - printed\n✅ Safety glasses for each participant\nStation 3: Battery Health Check\nEquipment Needed:\nReal battery sample\nFake/refurbished battery sample\n1 clamp meter\nStation folder with:\n✅ Battery specification sheets - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Health check procedure (AR/EN) - printed\nStation 4: MC4 Crimp & Test\nEquipment Needed:\nMC4 crimp tools\nMC4 connector pairs\n1 multimeter (polarity test)\nSafety gloves\nStation folder with:\n✅ MC4 connector specifications - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Crimp procedure checklist - printed\n✅ Polarity test instructions - printed\n⚠️ Trainer Note: Each station must have complete printed materials before participants arrive.

You’ll rotate through four stations, spending 15 minutes at each. When you hear the whistle, it’s time to switch.\nStation 1: Panel ISC Test\nTools: Solar-panel tester, leads, Workbook Tab 1 printout or tablet.\nTask: Connect the tester to the panel’s MC4 outputs, press the ‘ISC’ button, and record the short-circuit current you see.\nRecording: Enter that value under “Panel ISC” in Ahmed’s Coffee-Shop section of Workbook Tab 1.\u000b\nStation 2: Inverter Teardown\nTools: Document-camera setup, two inverters (genuine & refurbished), pointer.\nTask: Lift the lid under doc-cam and spot three features—large vs. small heatsink, presence of internal DC fuse, and copper-bus width.\nRecording: In your workbook, note “Genuine: ___, Cheap: ___” next to “Inverter Notes.”\u000b\nStation 3: Battery Temp-Log\nTools: IR thermometer (gun), clamp-meter, battery sample.\nTask: Measure surface temperature at three spots on the battery shell. Also clamp the meter on the battery terminal to verify voltage (just note for safety).\nRecording: Enter the highest temperature you log under “Battery Temp (°C)” in Tab 1.\u000b\nStation 4: MC4 Crimp & Polarity\nTools: Wire strippers, MC4 crimp tool, male/female MC4 pins, digital multimeter.\nTask: Strip 8 mm of PV cable, crimp a new MC4 pin, then mate male + female. Use the multimeter in continuity mode to confirm correct polarity (+ to +, – to –).\nRecording: Tick “Pass” or “Fail” under “MC4 Polarity” in your workbook.\n\nSafety & Speed:\nWear gloves & glasses at every station.\nKeep tools tidy and hand them to the next group when you rotate.\nWhistle = rotate: Don’t wait—move quickly to the next station when you hear it.\u000b\nGoal: By the end, each team will have logged one key data point per component directly into Workbook Tab 1, Ahmed’s Coffee-Shop section. This builds our field-measurement muscle and feeds into our ROI calculations later today.\n“Ready? Let’s start at Station 1\n\n🍴 LUNCH\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n\nMini-Debrief: Linking Theory ↔ Practice\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nYour Number\nDay 1\nMind-Map Rule\nFacilitator notes:\n“Alright, everyone—hands off tools. Time’s up!\u000b We’re going to close the loop between what we just did and our Compatibility Mind-Map theory.\nHere’s how it works: I’d like one volunteer from each team to come up and choose a single measurement you recorded at your station—maybe Voc = 38 V or I<sub>SC</sub> = 9.2 A. Write that number in the Your Number column on the board.\nAs soon as it’s up, I’ll circle it and point out which Mind-Map Rule it matches. For example, if you wrote Voc, I’ll link it to the yellow branch (Panel ↔ Inverter voltage range).\nLet’s keep this moving—you have 60 seconds on the timer!\n[After the first entry]\u000b Great—see how your Voc reading ties directly to that yellow branch? That’s powerful: real measurements grounding our theory.\nWho’s next? Keep it coming until the buzzer.\n[When 60 s are up]\u000b Fantastic—thank you! This exercise shows that theory and hands-on practice really are two sides of the same coin.\nNext, we’ll take these exact numbers and plug them into Ahmed’s ROI worksheet to see how they drive his solar business case. Ready? Let’s go!”\n\nLoad Calculation Workshop\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nSteps: \nMeasure amps with the plug meter  \nEnter numbers in sheet “Load & Baseline ROI” (works offline)  \nSheet auto-converts → kWh & IQD cost  \nAdd 20 % safety buffer  to every appliance line  \nInput three financial goals  inside the same sheet\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n“Now we become Ahmed’s sales engineers for 20 minutes. We’ll fill his Load & Baseline ROI sheet with real local data:\n\n1. Measure Appliance Current (3 min)\n• Plug the demo kettle into the power meter.\n• After 2 minutes, read the Current (A) display.\n• Enter that number under Current (A) on Ahmed’s row.\n\n2. Enter Usage & Voltage (2 min)\n• In Hours/day, type 8 (typical café opening hours).\n• In Voltage (V), type it\n\n3. Input Your Local Tariffs & Buffer (4 min)\n• Electricity Tariff (IQD/kWh): enter the rate you pay for grid power.\n• Genset Tariff (IQD/kWh): enter the diesel genset cost in your area.\n• 20% Buffer: it’s automatically\n\n4. Verify Automatic Calculations (2 min)\nThe sheet will now compute:\n• Amp-hours = Current × Hours\n• Watt-hours = Amp-hours × Voltage\n• kWh/day = Watt-hours ÷ 1 000\n• Grid cost/month = kWh/day × 30 × Electricity Tariff\n• Genset cost/month = kWh/day × 30 × Genset Tariff\nConfirm the numbers look reasonable—raise your hand if something seems off.\n\n5. Set Three Financial Goals (9 min)\nUnder 3 Financial Goals, each team decides:\n1. Target payback (years) – e.g. < 4\n2. Minimum monthly saving (IQD) – your desired IQD/month reduction vs. diesel\n3. Generator run-time reduction (%) – e.g. 80 %\nDiscuss and type your values. These goals will guide your Day 1 pitch to Ahmed.\n\n“I’ll circulate to assist.

It’s the same concept as his café being closed during a blackout.”\u000b\nTrigger the Calculation\n“Once you fill those five fields, watch the 10-year cost curves recalculate. They now include:\nPurchase price\nReplacement cycles (based on lifespan)\nCost of lost days offline (using your ‘lost income’ input)”\nKey Insight\n“This slide shows you exactly how Ahmed’s real monthly bills feed into the longer-term ROI model. It makes the idea tangible: expensive gear today can save more money over 10 years by reducing downtime.”\u000b\nNext Steps\n“Work with your partner to enter Ahmed’s numbers now (5 min).

Under-torque and the next big gust will loosen your rails, risking misalignment and damage.\nHands-on tip: When you hear that “click,” stop turning—over-torque can strip threads. Next up, we’ll quiz you on tilt and azimuth before we head onto rooftop checks.”\n\nTilt & Orientation\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nTilt & Orientation: PV module tilt is the angle between the panel and the ground. Solar panels work best when sunlight hits them directly. Optimal tilt depends on location and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is 32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best orientation.\nFacilitator notes:\n[Expert stands front, pointer in hand]\u000b “Okay, team—let’s talk about tilt and azimuth.\n‘Tilt’ is just how much you tip your panel up from flat ground. If it’s too flat, you miss low-angle winter sun; too steep, you lose high summer sun. In Mosul we aim for 32 to 36 degrees—that balance gives us the most energy year-round.\n‘Azimuth’ means the compass direction the panel faces. 0 degrees is true south, which gets the highest sun all day. A few degrees east or west are okay, but aim as close to south as you can.\n\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other structures can block sunlight from reaching solar panels. Even partial shading significantly reduces power output, as the entire string performance drops to that of the shaded panel. To maximize energy production year-round, it's important to avoid shaded spots when installing solar panels.\nFacilitator notes:\n[Expert gestures to shaded panel photo]\u000b “Next up: shading. This is a solar killer.\nAny time a bit of your panel is shaded, the whole string of panels drops in power—like a traffic jam on your roof.\nSee that tree branch on the right? That tiny stripe of shade can cost you 20 to 30 percent of your daily energy.\n\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\nWhat is the peak load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\nWhat is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\nHow many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries without other input sources?)\nIs there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\nWhat is the layout of the roof? Include equipment, shading obstacles, or barriers affecting solar installation.\nWhat is the direction of true south?\nWhat are the building’s operating hours?\nHow many days per week is the building operational?\nWhat type of building is it? (Residential, commercial, or industrial)\nAre there any shading risks? (e.g., trees or nearby buildings)\nAny additional information?\nFacilitator notes: \n[Expert moves to center, makes eye contact]\u000b “Here’s your Field Survey Checklist—twelve key questions you always ask on any new rooftop. Today, we’ll practice using it.\nActivity Instructions:\nI need you in your teams to choose one nearby roof—your house, or the building next door.\nTake five minutes to answer the first six questions on the left in jot-form on a sticky note:\nPeak and average amps, future growth, grid availability, system type, and battery autonomy.\nAlso note any shading obstacles you spot—trees, pipes, walls.\u000b\nGo!

That’s almost one-sixth of your daily yield gone, simply because the sun can’t penetrate the dirt.”\u000b\nBar-Chart Walkthrough (20 s)\u000b “Here on the left, the ‘Clean’ bar represents the full 100 percent rated output. Next to it, the ‘Dusty’ bar falls to roughly 85 percent—a tangible loss that erodes your ROI faster every month.”\u000b\nMaintenance Solution (30 s)\u000b “The good news? A weekly wipe restores the panel back to over 95 percent of its original performance. That’s only a 5 percent drop versus 15 percent if you wait a month.”\u000b\nCustomer Pitch Tease (25 s)\u000b “This data underpins our maintenance-service offer. In our ‘Sell’ block later, you’ll see how to turn a 5 percent performance guarantee into a compelling subscription package for homeowners and businesses. Imagine promising ‘Less than one day of dust loss per week—guaranteed,’ and backing it with hard numbers.”\u000b\nTransition (10 s)\u000b “Next, we’ll move into our Frame & Torque checklist—because after we agree on cleaning frequency, we must ensure the hardware stays tight and secure against Mosul’s winds.”\n\n\nHaykal Mounting Frame – Key Checks\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nKit frame (bolt-together) vs welded steel  \nTorque spec 18 Nm \nMust resist wind-load ≥ 1.5 kN/m² on Mosul roofs\nFacilitator notes:\nFrame Options (45 s)\u000b “On the left you see the bolt-together kit—quick to assemble with basic tools—and on the right a fully welded steel bracket. The kit is fastest on site; the welded frame can be stronger but costs more in labour.”\u000b\nTorque Spec (30 s)\u000b “Every M8 bolt must be tightened to 18 Nm—just like on your MC4 and rail-mount tasks. Under-torque risks loosening; over-torque can strip threads.”\u000b\nWind-Load Calculation (60 s)\u000b “Mosul’s design wind pressure is 1.5 kN/m², which translates to about 150 kgf per m² of panel area: \nF = Pressure × Area  \nF = 1 500 N/m² × 1 m² ≈ 1 500 N ≈ 150 kgf  \nThat’s why we limit rail spans to 1.5 m—to keep bending loads within safe limits—and why in Tab 3 of your workbook you’ll price extra brackets or gussets so your kit stays solid in a storm.”\u000b\nTransition to Apply (30 s)\u000b “Now let’s head to our framing station, where you’ll practice bolting the kit rails to a mock roof section, torque them to 18 Nm, and sketch where extra brackets go.

Ladder Angle (30 s)\u000b “First, the ladder. You see the 75° icon—why 75°? Too shallow and it slips out; too steep and it tips backward. To find 75°, stand with your toes at the ladder base, reach your arms straight out: your palms should just touch a rung. Practice that every time you set up.”\n2. Harness & Anchor (45 s)\u000b “Next, fall protection. Every one of you must wear a harness clipped to a certified anchor point. No exceptions. If you’re more than one step onto the roof, hook in before moving. The anchor must be rated for at least 5 kN—always inspect the hardware before use.”\n3. Insulated Gloves & Safety Glasses (30 s)\u000b “Finally, PPE. Even if you’re just tightening a bolt, insulated gloves protect you from unexpected live wires or sharp edges. Safety glasses shield your eyes from dust, flying debris, or cable snap-backs. Keep them on from the moment you step onto the roof.”\nQuick Check (15 s)\u000b “Popcorn style—shout out one rooftop hazard we haven’t covered yet!”\u000b (Wait for a response, e.g., hot surfaces, sun exposure.)\nTransition (10 s)\u000b “Great—keep these rules top of mind all day. Next up, we’ll move into our wind-load and torque block, where we’ll practice safe bolt-torquing on a mock frame.”\n\nFuse & Ground Rules\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nFuse on positive DC as close to battery as possible\nUse DC-rated breakers for combiner if > 4 strings\nGrounding and lightning rod ≥ 2 m, copper-clad 16 mm Ø. Target ≤ 5 Ω earth resistance (demo showed 12 Ω acceptable only for class)\nTest resistance ≤ 5 Ω (goal)\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s cover two non-negotiables in every hybrid PV system: DC fusing and earthing.”\n1) Battery-Positive Fuse (45 s):\u000b “Always install the first fuse on the positive DC cable right at the battery’s terminal. Why? If a short happens anywhere in the wiring, that fuse blows instantly and protects every meter of cable, every combiner box, and your inverter. No fuse here means your cable could catch fire or your battery pack could go into thermal runaway.”\n2) DC-Rated Breakers at Combiners (30 s):\u000b “When you have more than four panel strings feeding a combiner, swap the standard fuse for a DC-rated miniature breaker. DC arcs don’t self-extinguish as fast as AC arcs—so you need a breaker designed for DC interruption. Always check the label: it should say ‘DC’ or ‘PV use.’”\n3) Ground Rod Specs (30 s):\u000b “For your earth electrode, drive at least 2 meters of 16 mm-diameter copper-clad steel into the ground, as shown here. Copper-clad offers corrosion resistance, so your rod stays conductive for years.”\n4) Earth Resistance Target (30 s):\u000b “After driving the rod, measure ground-to-rod resistance. In class we saw 12 Ω, which is fine for a demo. But on a real rooftop or field installation, we aim for ≤ 5 Ω. Why? Lightning and surge currents will always seek the path of least resistance—so you want it going into the earth rod, not through your inverter or structure.”\nTransition to Demo (15 s):\u000b “Now that we understand the why and how, let’s head out and test our demo rod to see that 12 Ω reading in action.”\n\nEarthing Rod Mini-Demo\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nHammer 1 m rod  \nConnect tester – read Ω value on screen\nFacilitator notes:\n“Time for live verification—let’s test our earthing rod.”\n1) Safety First (15 s):\u000b “Before anyone swings, helmet, gloves, and work boots on. Check that no one is standing within the hammer’s arc.”\n2) Hammering the Rod (30 s):\u000b “Trainee, please drive that 1 m rod straight down until only about 10 cm protrudes. Keep it vertical—any tilt reduces contact area with the earth.”\n3) Connecting the Meter (30 s):\u000b “Now, clip one multimeter lead to the top of the rod clamp and the other to our reference stake. Set the meter to the ohms range.”\n4) Reading & Context (30 s):\u000b “We’re seeing 12 Ω. Remember, for a real rooftop you want ≤ 5 Ω—so you’d add water to the soil or drive a second rod nearby to lower the resistance.”\n5) Quick Q&A (15 s):\u000b “Why do you think soil moisture matters? … Exactly: water improves conductivity between the rod and surrounding earth.”\n6) Wrap-up & Transition (15 s):\u000b “Great work—now that you’ve seen how to measure earth resistance.”\n\n🍴 LUNCH\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n\nStation Checklist\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nStation 2\nDust-Loss Demo & Cleaning\nStation 1\n 4-Panel Roof-Rig Build\nStation 3\nShading & Orientation Mini-Survey\n4× Longi 600 W panels (or equivalent)\nHaykal metal frame kit for 4 panels (rails, legs, M8 bolts & nuts)\nTorque wrench set (pre-set to 18 Nm)\nM8 bolts/nuts (spare)\nDC cable 4 mm² (to simulate PV cabling)\nUNI-T Solar Panel Tester (ISC mode)\nFine sand (small tubs) + tray or tarp\nSoft brushes / microfiber cloths\nSticky-note pads & pens (for logging “before/after” ISC readings)\nCardboard “mini-house” prop\nDesk lamp(s) + extension cord\nProtractors & tape measures\nPrinted Tilt/Azimuth chart\nNote: All remaining items (inverters, batteries, MC4 tools, safety gear, etc.) are staged for Day 2 and will return in later modules.\n\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s walk the room—each station needs only its own subset of gear from our big materials list.”\u000b\nStation 1 (4-Panel Frame):\n“You should see four Longi panels, the Haykal frame kit, your torque wrenches set to 18 Nm, M8 bolts and a coil of 4 mm² cable.

Just like yesterday, we’ve organized them into our Learn–Apply–Sell rhythm:\nLEARN:\nExplain DC ≠ AC fuses; recall lock-out rule – by mid-morning you’ll understand why you can’t swap AC breakers for DC, and you’ll be able to run our zero-injury lock-out/tag-out ritual flawlessly.\nSpot heatsink, internal fuse & BMS in premium gear – you’ll break down real inverters and batteries under the doc-cam and point out the build-quality features that earn customer trust.\nCalculate 10-year cost & pay-back (cheap vs premium) – in theory, you’ll model total cost of ownership over a decade and identify when the ‘premium’ option starts saving money.\u000b\nAPPLY:\u000b 4. Measure surface temp; choose placement < 35 °C – you’ll use an IR gun to log battery casing temperatures and decide the safest mounting location.\u000b 5. Strip, crimp, torque 18 Nm; test breaker trip < 1 s – at our hands-on stations, you’ll size and crimp MC4 cables, torque M8 bolts, and verify a DC breaker clears in under one second.\nSELL:\u000b 6. Use ROI + real warranty to handle price objection – at the end of the day you’ll draw on your cost models and warranty red-flags to craft a persuasive response when a customer balks at higher upfront costs.\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTool Overview – Why PVWatts?\nDay 4\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) - PVWatts Calculator\n(https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/index.php)\nAssists with:\nIrradiation modeling\nHouse orientation analysis\nSolar energy output estimation\nFacilitator notes:\nPurpose of PVWatts (20 s)\n“PVWatts is a free, web-based tool that lets you estimate a solar array’s annual and monthly energy production in just a few clicks. It handles three key tasks for you:\nIrradiation modeling – it uses NASA satellite data to calculate average sun hours for your location.\nOrientation analysis – you can adjust tilt and azimuth and instantly see how those choices affect yield.\nOutput estimation – it converts panel wattage into expected kWh/day and kWh/year.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTool Overview – Why PVWatts?\nDay 4\nFacilitator notes:\nIntro & Context (15 s): “On this slide you see screen captures from the NREL PVWatts Calculator. We’ll be using PVWatts today to quickly simulate system output before moving into more complex tools.”\nWalk-through the Interface (30 s): “Let’s look at the main sections:\nLocation input: enter Mosul, Iraq here to load local climate data.\nSystem info: set your DC system size (e.g. 3 kW), module type, and array type.\nAdjustments: panel tilt, azimuth, system losses (dirt, wiring).\nResults: scroll down to see the monthly production graph and annual kWh.”\nWhy PVWatts for Day 4 (20 s): “We choose PVWatts because it’s fast, reliable, and gives you a consistent baseline. Today you’ll:\nRun simulations for different panel tilts and sizes.\nCompare your clean-sheet estimates with the real-world data you collected yesterday.\nLearn how small changes—like rotating your array 10° east—can gain or lose hundreds of kWh per year.”\nTransition to Demo (15 s): “Next up, I’ll demo a live PVWatts run: we’ll input our Mosul coordinates, set a 4 kW array with a 30° tilt, and review the output curve. Then, you’ll pair up and simulate your own scenarios.”\nTrainer Tips\n“Encourage participants to note the “Effective Sun Hours” value—it’s the core driver of kWh.\nRemind them that PVWatts assumes “clean” modules; compare against yesterday’s dust-loss data in your lab.\nIf someone’s connection is slow, show them the desktop screenshot you projected.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nSystem Sizing & Design Assumptions\nDay 4\nAssumption\nValue\nBaseline system size\n1 kW ⇒ ~1 200 kWh / yr\nPanel tilt\n32–36 °\nAzimuth\n0 ° (true south)\nTemp coefficient\n–0.35 % / °C (≈10 % loss @ 50 °C)\nPerformance ratio target\n≥ 75 %\nIrradiation\n~ 5 kWh / m² / day\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s pause and lock in our ‘standard recipe’ before we design any system.”\nBaseline energy yield (10 s):\n“We assume 1 kW of panels will deliver roughly 1 200 kWh per year in Mosul. That’s our rule of thumb for initial sizing.”\u000b\nOptimal tilt & azimuth (15 s):\n“Tilting panels between 32 and 36 degrees and facing them due south (0 ° azimuth) captures the most sun over the year. Small deviations cost you a few percent of output.”\u000b\nTemperature coefficient (20 s):\n“Every degree above STC reduces power by 0.35 %. At 50 °C on a hot roof, you lose about 10 % of nameplate capacity—so pick panels with a good temp-coef or size up accordingly.”\u000b\nPerformance ratio target (15 s):\n“Our Performance Ratio (PR)—the real-world efficiency after losses—should be 75 % or higher. This accounts for wiring, inverter conversion, soiling, and temperature.”\u000b\nIrradiation (10 s):\n“Mosul averages around 5 kWh/m² per day of sun. Multiply that by your array’s kWp and PR to forecast daily kWh.”\n“With these numbers, you can jump into PVWatts, run your first ‘clean-sheet’ simulation, and then compare to our real-world data from Day 3’s roof-rig. Ready? Let’s go!”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nLaptop & Software Check\nDay 4\nChecklist:\nNavigate to pvwatts.nrel.gov\nSet Location: Mosul, Iraq (use search bar)\nConfirm Inputs:\nSystem size: 1 kW\nTilt: 34 ° (midpoint)\nAzimuth: 0 °\nFallback Plan:\nIf site won’t load, open the offline Excel PVWatts template (link on desktop)\nOr use the printed output screenshots in your folder\nFacilitator notes:\n“Before we dive into our live PVWatts run, let’s make sure every laptop is ready.”\nNavigate (20 s):\n“Please open your browser and go to pvwatts.nrel.gov. You should see the welcome page with a world map.”\u000b\nLocation Setup (20 s):\n“In the ‘Location’ box, type Mosul, Iraq and select it from the list. This ensures our radiation data is correct.”\u000b\nConfirm Inputs (30 s):\n“Check that the System Size is 1 kW, Tilt is around 34 °, and Azimuth is 0 °. We’ll adjust these later, but for now these defaults get us started.”\u000b\nFallback Plan (30 s):\n“If PVWatts is loading slowly or your internet hiccups, don’t panic:\nOpen the ‘PVWatts_Offline.xlsx’ on your desktop (this is an Excel template with the same inputs).\nOr, use the printed screenshots in your folder to follow along.”\u000b\nFinal Check (20 s):\n“Once you see the Mosul map pin and the input form ready, give me a thumbs-up or a quick nod. If you’re stuck, raise your hand now—let’s solve it before we launch the simulation.”\nTransition:\u000b “Great—everyone online? Fantastic. Now, let’s run a 5-minute live demo of PVWatts and see what it predicts for our 1 kW system in Mosul.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\nLive Demo — PVWatts\nFacilitator notes:\n“We’ll run PVWatts live so you see every click. A volunteer will drive the laptop on the projector.”\n1. Recruit a Driver (20 s)\n“Who’d like to be our pilot? — Great, Fatima, come up.”\nHand the wireless mouse.\n“Rest of you, follow on your own laptops.”\n2. Location Input (40 s)\n“Top left: click ‘Get Started’.”\n“In the Location box, type ‘Mosul, Iraq’ and press Enter.”\n“Confirm the map pin sits near the city centre—accurate radiation data comes from this step.”\n(Address connectivity: “If your page lags, just watch the projector— you can repeat after the demo.”)\n3. System Info (60 s)\n“System Size: type 1 kW (we model per-kW first).”\n“Module Type: leave at Standard.”\n“Array Type: select Fixed (roof).”\n“Tilt: put 34°—that’s our midpoint from the assumptions slide.”\n“Azimuth: 0° (due south).”\n“Scroll to System Losses: keep the default 14 % for now—we’ll tweak it after we see the raw result.”\n(Point out where each number appears so trainees can replicate.)\n4. Run & Read Results (60 s)\n“Click ‘Calculate’.”\n“In the results pane note: Annual AC Energy ≈ 1 200 kWh—matches our 1 kW baseline rule.”\n“Hover over the bar chart to see monthly spread—June tops out, December is lowest.”\n5. Quick Sensitivity Check (50 s)\n“Let’s see the impact of tilt. Change Tilt from 34° → 10° (flat roof).”\n“Re-calculate— annual kWh drops by about 5 %. That’s why tilt matters.”\n“Now adjust System Losses to 25 % to mimic dusty panels.”\n“Re-run—see how annual yield falls another ~10 %. Dust eats money.”\n6. Link to Today’s Apply Block (40 s)\n“You’ll run similar what-if tests for your own roof photos:\nBaseline clean vs dusty,\nCurrent tilt vs optimal tilt,\nWith or without an extra 2 kW string.”\n“Record each annual kWh so we can feed them into your expansion cash-flow sheet.”\u000b\n7. Handoff (30 s)\n“Fatima, thank you—excellent piloting!” (applause)\n“Everyone else: if your browser is ready, repeat those same steps right now—but keep your own roof tilt. You have two minutes before we move into the PVsyst demo.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nInterpreting Outputs\nDay 4\nAnnual Energy Yield:\n1200 kWh/yr \u000bper kW installed\nPerformance Ratio (PR):\n75 % \u000bActual vs. theoretical\nLoss Breakdown Stack:\n*Stacked bar chart showing loss categories (e.g. Soiling 10 %, Shading 5 %, Inverter 8 %, Temperature 6 %, Misc. 5 %)\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s walk through what these numbers mean for your system.”\nAnnual Energy Yield (Left Panel)\n“This big number is how much AC energy one kilowatt of panels will produce in a year, in kilowatt-hours.\nIn our Mosul example it shows ≈ 1 200 kWh/yr per kW of panels.\nIf you have a 3 kW array, multiply by three—about 3 600 kWh annually.”\u000b\nPerformance Ratio (Middle Panel)\n“Performance Ratio, or PR, tells us how close the real system comes to its ideal output.\nA PR of 75 % means you get 75 % of the theoretical maximum after accounting for losses.\nHigher PR means a cleaner, better-installed system; lower PR flags issues like soiling, wiring losses, or shading.”\u000b\nLoss Breakdown (Right Panel)\n“This stacked bar shows where the missing 25 % goes:\nSoiling (dust and dirt) – today’s big enemy in Mosul.\nShading – trees or neighbors.\nInverter & wiring – conversion and cable losses.\nTemperature – hot panels lose efficiency.\nOther – mismatch, downtime, etc.\nBy reading this chart you can prioritize fixes: e.g. if soiling is 10 %, schedule more frequent cleanings.”\u000b\nTie-In to Apply Block:\n“When you run PVWatts on your own roof, note:\nYour annual yield—this feeds into your cash-flow model.\nYour PR—aim for at least 70 %; lower means something needs attention.\nBiggest loss—that’s your prime service or improvement opportunity (like cleaning, re-tilting, or shade trimming).”\u000b\nTransition:\n“Now that we know how to read these key outputs, let’s move on to our PVsyst growth scenario and see how more capacity or different layouts change these numbers.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nYour Turn — Laptop Workshop\nDay 4\nStep 1: Load Your Roof Photo\nOpen your browser and go to PVWatts.\nUpload the rooftop image you prepared.\nStep 2: Run the Simulation\n🖥️ Use baseline inputs (1 kW, tilt 34°, azimuth 0°, PR 75 %).\n▶️ Click “Run Simulation” (wait ~30 s).\nStep 3: Capture Your Numbers\n📈 Annual Yield (kWh/yr)\n⚙️ Performance Ratio (%)\n📊 Top Loss Category (%)\nFacilitator notes:\n“All right, it’s time to turn theory into practice! Here’s what you’ll do for the next 40 minutes.”\nIntroduce the Activity (15 s)\n“Please open your laptops and navigate to PVWatts. You should already have your own rooftop photo or GPS coordinates from yesterday’s homework.”\u000b\nStep 1: Load Your Roof Photo (30 s)\n“On the left side of the slide, you see how to upload: use the ‘Upload File’ button, select your image, and click ‘Continue’. If you run into connection issues, switch to coordinates mode and enter your site’s latitude and longitude.”\u000b\nStep 2: Run the Simulation (30 s)\n“Next, confirm the baseline inputs we agreed on — 1 kW system size, tilt 34°, azimuth 0°, performance ratio of 75 %. Don’t change them unless your roof has a special tilt. Then press ‘Run Simulation’. It takes about 20–30 seconds to calculate.”\u000b\nStep 3: Capture Your Numbers (30 s)\n“When the results appear, record three key outputs into your worksheet:\u000b • Annual Yield (kWh/year)\u000b • Performance Ratio (%)\u000b • Dominant Loss (e.g. soiling or temperature in percent)\u000b Enter those values now in your “PVWatts Results” table. These feed directly into your Day-4 cash-flow model later today.”\u000b\nLogistics & Timing (15 s)\n“You have 40 minutes for this workshop. If you finish early, start comparing your PRs and yields—notice who gets the highest performance.”\u000b\nSupport & Troubleshooting (10 s)\n“If anyone’s tool won’t load or the site is slow, raise your hand.

How will this training help them when they go to Mosul\nSolar and apply and say I went to training with Bayt for six days, and I\ndesigned two panels and this is the panel in the city. This is\nconvincing to an employee. What else can we do to make it, I mean, it\nshouldn't just be a piece of paper with the name of a person who did it\nfor six days, I don't know what?\\\n\\\n00:46:06 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. We will be able to make sure that it is a continuous training or\ndrills, or this will give us a chance for it to work, I mean, for me, if\nsomeone comes to train with me for three or four days, I cannot give him\nup, or I mean, this is not a waste of my time on him, or ha ha ha\\\n\\\n00:46:26 BILAL\\\nYes, that\\'s right, and you need people, I mean, you have bigger\nprojects, you need a big team to be able to suffice\\\n\\\n00:46:37 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. And what I know, and what I know is better than. Than what I don\\'t\nknow\\\n\\\n00:46:42 BILAL\\\n. Right. Right. But if they want to, they will cause trouble, I mean, I\nwill strangle you, you didn\\'t need\\\n\\\n00:46:50 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Another place, for sure\\\n\\\n00:46:52 BILAL\\\n. Let\\'s say\\\n\\\n00:46:53 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Yes, of course I don\\'t know\\\n\\\n00:46:58 BILAL\\\nmeans they go to Erbil?\\\n\\\n00:47:01 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\ncertificate that he is from my soul anywhere, that he can answer all the\nquestions, what should we do?\\\n\\\n00:47:11 BILAL\\\n. So we need an exam\\\n\\\n00:47:12 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\nmeans me ah, meaning whoever goes to the interview, ah, all the people I\ntrained I have is a person named Yahya, he was with us in a house, now\nhe is working in Germany, that\\'s great. Remember, maybe they won third\nprize?\\\n\\\n00:47:30 BILAL\\\n. Oh, true. Ah, he remembers the Alif in Hackathon\\\n\\\n00:47:34 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\nin Hackathon, he was with us, and he was the first trainee who was with\nme to work. Ah, it was good because of the information we gave him. He\nused to go to the professors at the university to discuss with them and\ndefeat them, because he was receiving practical and theoretical training\nat the time, and now because his experience is completely sufficient in\nthe field, ah, in Germany, wow\\\n\\\n00:48:00 BILAL\\\n. It\\'s good, so in my opinion, experience is not only necessary on\npaper, it is necessary to be honest and able to answer the questions.\\\n\\\n00:48:06 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\nWhy don\\'t you ask?\\\n\\\n00:48:07 BILAL\\\n. Part of the training? An interview is like an interview for a company.\nNot everyone goes through it. It\\'s okay to choose from them. Okay, here\nyou go, Khaled. Then we conduct an interview however you want to hire.\\\n\\\n00:48:20 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Let\\'s talk about the people.\\\n\\\n00:48:21 BILAL .\\\nYou bring, you know what\\'s good?

A play?\nThey come and pretend that they will apply for a job and they have to\nanswer all the questions. Oh, isn\\'t the exam going to be a pen and\npaper exam or something? No, the exam is the interview. What do you\nthink?\\\n\\\n00:48:52 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN .\\\nIs it good, good? And in?\\\n\\\n00:48:56 BILAL\\\nReally. Because in the end, the experience will teach them not only all\nthe information from the interview, but also how one person sticks to\nit?\\\n\\\n00:49:02 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\nhimself?\\\n\\\n00:49:04 BILAL\\\n. I mean, under pressure, what can he answer? Yes? How can he say that I\ndon\\'t know, but I\\'ll tell you how he can? I know, I\\'ll call Mohammed\nAl-Qattan and tell him. I mean. So, these are nice in the six days.\nLet\\'s find time for them. I think this is a great idea .\\\n\\\n00:49:22 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN,\\\nit\\'s really nice and important. Yes, and nice. How many hours are the\ntraining hours?\\\n\\\n00:49:28 BILAL\\\nThe idea of the nine for the heritage is something like 5 hours a day,\napproximately, for six days. Yes, if we need it and we couldn\\'t miss it\nin six, I mean, we\\'ll strip it down to seven, and I\\'m the ITC channel,\nGod willing, we\\'ll need seven and that\\'s it.\\\n\\\n00:49:46 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. So, time is very short. Hahaha I know\\\n\\\n00:49:49 BILAL\\\n. I know I remember\\\n\\\n00:49:49 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. The information is very large, he said\\\n\\\n00:49:52 BILAL\\\n. They said five, I told them Mohammed Al-Qattan is going crazy, yeah,\nhe told me it would take a month. Hahaha\\\n\\\n00:49:58 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. But these\\\n\\\n00:49:59 BILAL\\\n. Engineers, I mean. We\\'re starting from scratch, we\\'re starting with\npeople\\\n\\\n00:50:02 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. This is the sweet thing, yes the idea was that we would come as\ntechnicians, but now the engineers are different, the idea definitely\nneeds\\\n\\\n00:50:10 BILAL\\\nto know enough. So that they can, right?\\\n\\\n00:50:14 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. They work directly\\\n\\\n00:50:17 BILAL\\\n. They explain the subject, they make the design, the whole model, I\nmean the correct idea they review and I mean at least a little bit of\nthe assembly they need to have\\\n\\\n00:50:27 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\nto know how to do it in the selection of the trainees, how will it be?\\\n\\\n00:50:33 BILAL\\\nSo now?",

So this\nidea of presenting the Al , and then you take it and transform it in the\nway you like and present it and, I mean, help the conductor of Space for\nthe Coordination so that they can bring\\\n\\\n00:53:10 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Everything\\\n\\\n00:53:10 BILAL\\\n. They have the space and they make schedules\\\n\\\n00:53:15 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Everything, everything is great\\\n\\\n00:53:19 BILAL\\\n. I don\\'t know what the fee is for the trainers, is there? And for the\nguys? There will be transportation and I don\\'t know what else, I mean\nmeals, snacks and tea, like that, God willing\\\n\\\n00:53:35 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Okay, everything, as for me, I have no problem with four-free. Hahaha\\\n\\\n00:53:41 BILAL\\\n. As for you, I will share this psyche. Hr, you will find guys to hang\nout with, God willing\\\n\\\n00:53:49 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. God willing. God willing, God is generous. And then, God willing, God\nwilling\\\n\\\n00:53:55 BILAL\\\nwe will see the number of megawatts and what will be the new number for\nyou, megawatts?\\\n\\\n00:54:02 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Yes? Yes, from training, not from the trainers. I will see you. How\nmany after a year? How many have we trained? And what have they\nachieved? Oh, it doesn't mean work, yes.\\\n\\\n00:54:16 BILAL\\\n. Nice. What do you like? Yes. This. This ratio means a megawatt. It\nmeans a megawatt above the train. It will show you the strength of your\ntraining. Let's say you trained 101 and each one does one megawatt. You\nknow, if you improve with training, if next year you train 101, and each\none generally gets two megawatts for three. So this is a number\\\n\\\n00:54:46 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. It means the strength\\\n\\\n00:54:46 BILAL\\\n. of your training\\\n\\\n00:54:49 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. By God, God willing, you will achieve it. God willing, the challenge\nhas happened. God willing\\\n\\\n00:54:57 BILAL\\\n. And we see a green future, and I mean, beautiful, God willing, yes,\nand I mean, I always think about whether we should remind ourselves that\nsometimes we forget and always focus on the numbers and training, and I\ndon\\'t know what, but business is structured in the end, we want to do\nthings that will mean, we will benefit people, we will benefit the\nworld, we will improve the pledge, so that we will have hope and\ndirection for the future.

Last month, our colleague Ali had an accident...\n[Tell Ali's story from interviews - emphasize the consequence]\n\nOur safety ritual - memorize this:\n1. ISOLATE - Open breaker, lock out, tag with your name\n2. VERIFY - Test zero volts with multimeter  \n3. PPE - Gloves and glasses always on\n4. BUDDY - Never work alone\n5. TOOLS - Only insulated tools for electrical work\n6. CLEAR - Shout 'CLEAR!' before reconnecting\n7. NO TOUCH - Never touch live DC strings\n\nLet's practice. [Volunteer] come lock out this breaker...\"\n```\n\n**Demo:** Walk through complete lock-out procedure\n\n## 09:40 - LEARN Block\n\n### Slide 9: Iraq Energy Reality\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Why are we here? Look at these numbers:\n- Generators: 380-450 IQD/kWh - expensive and dirty\n- Grid: 100-160 IQD/kWh - but only 8-12 hours daily\n- Solar potential: 3,000 sun-hours yearly in Mosul\n\nShow of hands - who ran their generator over 12 hours yesterday?\nThe sun is free and reliable. Let's capture it.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 10: Three Solar Set-Ups\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Three ways to go solar:\n\nOFF-GRID: Complete independence, needs batteries. Perfect for remote sites.\nPro: No grid fees. Con: High battery cost.\n\nON-GRID: Direct grid connection, no batteries. For stable grid areas.\nPro: Lowest cost. Con: No power when grid fails.\n\nHYBRID: Grid + batteries. Best for Mosul's reality.\nPro: Always have power. Con: More complex.\n\nWe focus on hybrid - it matches our context.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 11: Wall of Challenges\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Quick poll - who's measured roof heat over 45°C? \nWho paid over 15,000 IQD per amp last month?\n\n[Get 2 short stories - 30s each]\n\nThese four challenges - heat, dust, cost, faults - are exactly what we solve this week.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 12: Solar = Light → Electricity\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Here's the magic: photons hit the PN-junction, electrons jump, creating DC current.\n\nIn Mosul's 49°C heat, panels lose up to 14% power. That's why factories flash-test \neach panel for just 1 millisecond to verify output before shipping.\n\nPop quiz - where's the P-layer? [Point to diagram]\nRight! Now let's see how this differs from an LDR...\"\n```\n\n### Slide 13: Mini Demo - Night Light Circuit\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Watch this LDR circuit:\n- Cover LDR → LED turns ON\n- Shine light → LED turns OFF\n\nKey point: LDR controls electricity, solar cells CREATE it. \nBig difference! One needs power, one makes power.\"",

Because just to fix them, if there is a wind,\nyes, they break and it is pulled, yes, yes, so the idea is that they fix\nthem on it\\\n\\\n00:45:06 SPK_1\\\n. And inside it is dirt. I mean, dirt\\\n\\\n00:45:08 SPK_2\\\ndirt. Yes, I mean? Yes, exactly, yes. Trump, did you leave him? Its\natmosphere is dust, so they pierce it and fix it on an iron structure,\nit has the weight of the structural element on the basis that it is\nstable, but if it comes to you, especially in the high-rise buildings,\nyes, whoever comes, I mean, and you are high, there is a very high wind\nload on the panels, so they are torn off in place and fall to the\nground, and we have these problems, a lot of failures in the structure,\nbecause they did not take into account the binding that is happening\nnow. It started because new materials were introduced, I mean, this was\na process that was in Iraq, yes, now standards started to come from\nwhere they became Mechano to use them. Yes, now, it is somewhat better.\nIt became the quality of the batteries. The batteries we have now have a\nbig problem, with the introduction of lithium-ion and lithium-ion. Yes,\nit is difficult to test it. So, yes, the price is what makes the\ndifference in this matter. It comes renewed. You know what type of\nrenewed is? It is basically Defected and opened it, replacing a group of\ncells with it and returning it, and you will be exactly right, one\nlifetime, one lifetime on the model, it will come to you as if it is\nnew, the citizen buys it, and they give a warranty, which is a warranty\nfor you, why? Because after two years, my penalty, the names will not be\nable to be used. Hahaha, there are no names. Hahaha, there are no names,\nthese names that exist will all disappear. Ah, so there will be a\nfailure in this matter, and the real danger of the danger of the days in\nthem in the subject of the explosion, meaning you could have an\nexplosion of MP because of the temperature, or an increase in the\npolarity, if there is no management or charging for the batteries.\\\n\\\n00:47:01 SPK_1\\\nWe can overcome this with training until we can, meaning\\\n\\\n00:47:08 SPK_2\\\n. Therefore, no one is allowed to work in this matter, if he does not\nhave a certificate, so now the problem is that there is qualification\nfor companies. Qualification for companies that will work on the Central\nBank initiative to work on anything related to the state, but outside\nthe state, there is nothing. There is something preventing someone from\nworking in the field of solar energy, there is no leave, I mean, right\nnow, no one tells me, \\\"Dad, do you have a leave to work or not?\\\" I\nbring materials, hahaha, and I advertise, and I do an ad on Facebook,\nand I do what I do, and I make an ad, and people come and buy from me,\nand I do, okay, we don\\'t have consumer protection, so the system fails\nand problems arise and this happens and no one holds it accountable\\\n\\\n00:47:49 SPK_1\\\n.",

How could we prevent it?\n\nAlways: Isolate → Verify zero volts → Use insulated tools\"\n```\n\n### Slide 45: Why Teardown Matters\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Why compare cheap vs premium?\n\n1. See mechanical shortcuts - tiny heatsinks fail in 50°C\n2. Link quality to field performance - missing fuses = fires\n3. Build sales confidence - 'I've tested both, here's why quality saves money'\n\nThis isn't just technical - it's your value proposition foundation.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 46: Teardown Setup\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"I've pre-loosened four screws on each unit.\nHandle gently - we'll remove lids together.\n\nEach pair gets one cheap, one premium inverter.\n2 minutes to examine.

Explain the importance of datasheet literacy  \n2. Distribute datasheets and scavenger hunt worksheets  \n3. Guide trainees to find critical specifications:  \n   * Maximum voltage and current ratings  \n   * Operating temperature range  \n   * Warranty conditions and exclusions  \n   * Safety certifications and standards  \n4. Compare specifications across different brands  \n5. Discuss how to verify manufacturer claims\n\n**What to Say:** \"As Ali Abkan emphasizes, 'The most important thing is the datasheet. Read it before you work.' Datasheets contain critical information that prevents costly mistakes and ensures system compatibility.\n\nIn this exercise, you'll become familiar with reading technical specifications in both Arabic and English. Many serious installation problems in Mosul happen because installers skip this crucial step. They assume components are compatible without checking specifications, leading to failures that damage both equipment and your professional reputation.\"\n\n**Stories to Share:** \"An installer in East Mosul recently connected a 48V battery bank to an inverter rated for 24V maximum input. The inverter was destroyed instantly. When asked why he made this mistake, he admitted he never checked the datasheet—he assumed all inverters of that size would accept 48V. This simple oversight cost him 1.2 million IQD and a damaged reputation.\"\n\n### **Battery Safety & Placement (30 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Prepare battery placement guidelines with diagrams  \n* Create room temperature simulation cards (different scenarios)  \n* Have ventilation requirement checklist  \n* Prepare before/after photos of proper battery installations\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n1. Present thermal considerations for different battery types  \n2. Demonstrate temperature measurement techniques  \n3. Show proper ventilation calculations  \n4. Display examples of proper and improper installations  \n5. Have trainees create battery placement plans for typical Mosul homes\n\n**What to Say:** \"Battery placement is critical for system longevity. Mustafa Waleed points out that 'batteries placed in hot rooms have shorter lifespans—the biggest problem in Mosul.' Let's develop proper placement guidelines.",

It\\'s very high, but I don\\'t want to pay the price.\nHere, the customer is the engineer, meaning, for example, I won\\'t be\nable to give him an expensive battery. Yes, I have to choose a battery\nwhose price is compatible with the inverter, which is expensive, for\nexample, right? Right, it\\'s not right to choose a type that isn\\'t\ncompatible with the inverter. Now it has started\\\n\\\n00:18:44 BILAL\\\n.

This, this, you don\\'t have it with the customer yet, we are talking.\nAs engineers. These are the answers that must be given. The engineer\nknows them before he proposes anything. Because if he doesn\\'t know\nthem, he will face problems in the design and implementation. And if the\nbattery starts, the customer asks you, why did the battery start? I want\nthis, I chose this, he doesn\\'t know there is a technical problem,\ndon\\'t imagine\\\n\\\n00:19:26 BILAL\\\n. Yes, it\\'s true that it doesn\\'t match, so it must be from the\nbeginning\\\n\\\n00:19:28 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. This compatibility, all of this is necessary for the installer and the\nengineer working in the field\\\n\\\n00:19:34 BILAL\\\n. Right? Umm the\\\n\\\n00:19:39 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\ndesign that we\\'re talking about mistakes, come on yeah ask ask?\\\n\\\n00:19:45 BILAL\\\n. No, please\\\n\\\n00:19:47 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Yes, the design of the panels in terms of implementation, in terms of\nthe wind, in terms of the angle of inclination, and in terms of the\nshade. Yes, these are a lot of mistakes that engineers make, a lot. I\nmean, he makes a system in the sky, and any gust of wind after a year or\ntwo will happen or a problem will occur, this is fatal, so we have to\nimprove, I mean\\\n\\\n00:20:15 BILAL\\\n. We\\'re shooting banners, I mean, they gave people\\\n\\\n00:20:18 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. How many of you have it? I mean, with companies? Yes, that\\'s all? No\none publishes about us, because they don\\'t publish because this is what\ncompanies have to say, so they get scared\\\n\\\n00:20:28 BILAL\\\n. But it\\'s important that people focus on it\\\n\\\n00:20:31 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Very important. Praise be to God and thanks.
