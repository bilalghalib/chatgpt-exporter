      "content": "If Amazon marked your package as \"delivered\" but you can’t find it, here’s what you can do:  \n\n### 1. **Double-Check the Delivery Location**  \n- Check around your mailbox, front door, back door, or any nearby locations where it might have been left.  \n- Look for a delivery photo in your Amazon order details.  \n- Ask neighbors or building staff if they received it by mistake.  \n\n### 2. **Wait a Few Hours**  \n- Sometimes packages are marked as delivered early, and they arrive later in the day.  \n\n### 3. **Contact Amazon Support**  \n- Go to [Amazon’s Help Center](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us) and report a missing package.  \n- Choose “Where’s my stuff?” and follow the prompts.  \n- Amazon often refunds or replaces missing items.  \n\n### 4. **Check with the Carrier**  \n- If USPS, FedEx, or UPS handled delivery, contact them with the tracking number for more details.  \n\n### 5. **File a Claim if Necessary**  \n- If the package isn’t found, Amazon may ask you to file a claim under their **A-to-Z Guarantee** for a refund or replacement.  \n\nLet me know if you need help with filing a claim!",
