      "content": "To obtain U.S. citizenship documentation and a passport for your child born in France, you'll need to apply for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) and a U.S. passport. The CRBA serves as proof of U.S. citizenship for children born abroad to U.S. citizen parent(s).\n\n**Applying for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA):**\n\n1. **Eligibility:** A child born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent may acquire U.S. citizenship at birth if certain transmission requirements are met. These requirements include the U.S. citizen parent having a specific period of physical presence in the United States prior to the child's birth. It's advisable to review the specific eligibility criteria on the U.S. Department of State's website or consult with the U.S. Embassy or Consulate.\n\n2. **Application Process:** Traditionally, the CRBA application is submitted in person at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the country where the child was born. However, since you are currently in the United States, you should contact the U.S. Department of State or the nearest passport agency to inquire about the possibility of submitting the CRBA application while in the U.S. They can provide guidance on how to proceed and inform you of any alternative procedures available.\n\n**Applying for a U.S. Passport:**\n\nOnce the CRBA is approved, you can apply for your child's U.S. passport. The application for a minor's passport requires both parents' consent and the child's presence. If one parent cannot be present, a notarized consent form (Form DS-3053) from the absent parent is typically required.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Contact the U.S. Department of State or Nearest Passport Agency:** Since you are currently in the United States, reach out to the U.S. Department of State or visit a nearby passport agency to discuss your situation. They can provide specific instructions on how to apply for the CRBA and your child's passport while you are in the U.S.\n\n2. **Gather Required Documentation:** Prepare all necessary documents, including your child's French birth certificate, proof of your U.S. citizenship, evidence of your physical presence in the U.S. prior to your child's birth, your marriage certificate, and identification documents for both parents.\n\n3. **Schedule an Appointment:** Follow the guidance provided by the U.S. Department of State or the passport agency to schedule any required appointments.\n\nPlease note that procedures and requirements can change, so it's essential to consult directly with the appropriate U.S. authorities to ensure you have the most current information. ",
