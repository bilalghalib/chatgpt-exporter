The goal is to parse this string and map each answer to its corresponding question.\n\nHowever, the complexity arises because of the presence of commas within the answers themselves. A straightforward split on commas wouldn't work because it would break answers into unintended parts.\n\nTo address this, I propose a strategy:\n\n1. Loop through the answers string character by character.\n2. If we find a comma and the following characters (up to a certain length) match the beginning of the next question in the list, we'll treat that comma as a delimiter.\n3. If the comma does not precede any question, we'll treat it as a text comma and continue.\n4. We'll keep track of the current position in the questions list to ensure we're checking against the right next question.\n5. Once a delimiter comma is found, we'll map the accumulated answer string to the current question and move to the next question.\n6. Continue until all questions are mapped or the answers string ends.\n\nLet's implement this strategy.",

This problem is indeed more challenging due to the nature of the text and the presence of commas within answers.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. Instead of splitting the text at every comma, we'll iterate over each character.\n2. We'll accumulate characters until we hit a comma.\n3. Once we hit a comma, we'll check a certain number of characters ahead (say 200). If within those 200 characters we find another comma (without encountering any periods or other sentence-ending punctuation), we'll assume the current comma is a delimiter and split there.\n4. If the next comma is too far or there's a period before it, we'll assume the current comma is within a sentence and not split there.\n\nThis approach tries to leverage the idea that commas within sentences are likely followed by more text and then a period, while delimiter commas are likely followed by more text and then another comma.\n\nLet's implement this.",
