This aligns with Joe Edelman's perspective that values should be rooted in what creates meaningful experiences for people.\nOverall Approach Recommendations\nThe current \"Building a Brand\" session uses a standard corporate approach to values (selecting words from a list), which doesn't create the deep connection to meaning that drives authentic action. Here's how we can transform it:\n1. Shift from Values as Words to Values as Sources of Meaning\nThe current approach asks entrepreneurs to select value words from a list, which often results in generic corporate values (integrity, innovation, etc.) that don't necessarily guide authentic action or connect deeply with customers.\nRecommended Change:\n\nReplace the value word selection exercise with a meaning-based exploration\nFocus on identifying situations where entrepreneurs and their potential customers experience what matters most to them\nConnect these meaningful experiences to the business's potential positive impact\n\n2. Connect Values to the Business Efficiency Framework\nYour green integration approach focuses on practical business benefits rather than abstract environmental messaging. We should maintain this focus.\nRecommended Change:\n\nShow how values alignment creates business efficiency (reduced customer acquisition costs, stronger loyalty, better employee retention)\nDemonstrate how values-driven businesses can reduce risks by attracting more stable customer relationships\nEmphasize the competitive advantage of authentic values alignment\n\nSpecific Slide Improvements\nSlide 2: YOUR BRAND (Discussion Slide)\nCurrent: Basic discussion about brand elements\nImproved Version:\nCopyYOUR BRAND\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What defines a truly meaningful brand? What brands do you personally connect with and why?\n\nPotential answers:\n- Brands that solve real problems in my life\n- Brands that share my values about what matters\n- Brands that help me live better according to what I care about\n- Brands that are transparent and authentic\n- Brands that help me be more efficient with resources\n- Brands that respect my values and priorities\n\nFollow-up Question: How do these meaningful connections create business advantages like customer loyalty and word-of-mouth marketing?\n\nSummary: A brand is more than logo and visuals—it's a relationship based on shared values and meaningful experiences. When customers connect with your brand on a values level, they become advocates, reducing marketing costs and building resilience against market shifts.\nSlide 11-12: MISSION & VALUES (Discussion Slide)\nCurrent: Conventional mission/values discussion with some green elements\nImproved Version:\nCopyMISSION & VALUES: SOURCES OF MEANING\n\n10 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What makes work meaningful for you personally? When have you felt most fulfilled in your work?\n\nFacilitator notes:\n- Guide discussion toward meaningful experiences, not abstract concepts\n- Encourage examples of when entrepreneurs felt their work mattered\n- Connect these meaningful experiences to potential customer experiences\n\nKey Discussion Points:\n- Mission as shared purpose: What meaningful difference are you and your customers trying to make together?\n- Values as sources of meaning: What situations create meaningful experiences for you and your customers?\n- Authenticity matters: Customers can detect when values are just marketing vs. truly lived\n\nExamples:\n- Patagonia's mission isn't \"sustainability\" (an abstract word), but \"We're in business to save our home planet\" (a meaningful purpose)\n- Their values show up in repair services and \"Don't Buy This Jacket\" campaigns\n- This creates business advantages: lower marketing costs, higher customer loyalty, resilience to price competition\nSlides 14-15: DETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES (Activity)\nCurrent: Selection from a values word list\nImproved Value Discovery Exercise:\nCopyDISCOVER YOUR MEANINGFUL VALUES\n\n20 minutes: Activity\n\nIntroduction: \"Instead of selecting abstract value words, let's discover what truly creates meaning for you and your customers.\"\n\nStep 1: Meaningful Moments (5 min)\n- Write down 2-3 moments when you felt your work was truly meaningful\n- What made these moments matter to you?\n\nStep 2: Customer Meaning (5 min)\n- Based on your research, when do your customers experience meaningful moments related to your product/service?\n- What conditions or situations create meaning for them?\n\nStep 3: Business Advantages (5 min)\n- How could aligning with these sources of meaning:\n  * Reduce your marketing costs?\n  * Strengthen customer loyalty?\n  * Differentiate you from competitors?\n  * Create operational efficiencies?\n\nStep 4: Express Your Values (5 min)\n- Create value statements that express the conditions that create meaning\n- Example: \"We create opportunities for families to connect through shared outdoor experiences\" (vs. generic \"Family\" or \"Connection\")\nNew Slide: VALUES-DRIVEN BUSINESS ADVANTAGES\nCopyVALUES-DRIVEN BUSINESS ADVANTAGES\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nExplain: \"When values are authentic sources of meaning, they create concrete business benefits:\"\n\n1. Lower Customer Acquisition Costs\n   - Customers who share your values become advocates\n   - Word-of-mouth reduces marketing expenses\n\n2. Operational Efficiencies\n   - Values alignment reduces waste (doing only what matters)\n   - Staff motivated by meaningful work are more productive\n\n3. Business Resilience\n   - Values-aligned customers are less price-sensitive\n   - Meaningful connections survive market disruptions\n\n4. Resource Optimization\n   - Focus on what truly creates meaning often requires fewer resources\n   - Eliminating meaningless activities reduces waste\n\nExample: Patagonia's Worn Wear program repairs old clothing instead of selling new items - seems counterintuitive, but creates stronger customer loyalty and reduces marketing costs\nUpdated Positioning Statement Worksheet\nHere's an improved version of your positioning statement worksheet that integrates the values-as-meaning approach:\nCopy**Positioning Statement Worksheet**\n\nA positioning statement shows how your product/service creates meaningful value for your customers in a way that's different from competitors. Today we'll create a positioning that reflects both what you offer and the meaningful experiences you create.\n\n**PART 1: MEANINGFUL VALUE DISCOVERY**\n\nWhat meaningful experiences do your customers seek? \n_________________________________________________\n\nWhat barriers prevent them from having these experiences?\n_________________________________________________\n\nHow does your business enable these meaningful experiences?\n_________________________________________________\n\n**PART 2: UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION**\n\nThe unique value you provide (functional + meaningful):\n_________________________________________________\n\n**PART 3: POSITIONING STATEMENT TEMPLATE**\n\nTo: ____________(TARGET PERSONAS)_______________, \n          _____________**(PRODUCT NAME)**_________________ is the one\n          _______________(CATEGORY)____________________that\n          __________(KEY CUSTOMER BENEFIT)____________ unlike\n          _____(NEAREST COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE)______\n\n**EXAMPLE:**\n\nTO environmentally conscious travelers, **(EcoJourney App)** is the one travel planning platform that connects you with authentic local experiences while minimizing environmental impact, unlike standard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism regardless of its effects.\n\n**YOUR STATEMENT:**\n_________________________________________________\n_________________________________________________\n\n**PART 4: YOUR MISSION STATEMENT**\n(What meaningful difference are you and your customers making together?)\n_________________________________________________\n_________________________________________________\n\n**PART 5: YOUR VALUE STATEMENTS**\n(Describe situations that create meaning for you and your customers)\n\n1. _________________________________________________\n2. _________________________________________________\n3. _________________________________________________\n4. _________________________________________________\n5. _________________________________________________\nThis approach will help participants develop authentic, meaningful brand positions that naturally integrate efficiency and resource optimization as pathways to creating value, rather than treating sustainability as a separate \"green\" add-on. It aligns perfectly with your business-first approach to climate integration.RetryUPDATED COPY OF BUSINESS ETHICS\nBUSINESS ETHICS\n----\nAgenda\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Business Ethics and sustainability\n9:45 | Triple bottom line\n10:10 | Break\n10:25 | Define your impact\n11:40 - 1pastedBGhere's how we talk about ethics later, i'd like to update things to be more about internal exploration of sources of meaning and connecting them to values and things they care to do in the world: \nthis is slide 14's content : \"mission and values\" and the facilitator notes that i'd like help updating: [[[10 minutes: Discussion\n* Mission, vision, and values\n   * So, what are mission, vision, and value statements? What is the difference between them? \n   * Write out their thoughts on the board separating mission and values\n      * Mission statement: A Mission statement describes why the organization exists and why it does what it does.\n         * Usually is bigger than the organization itself\n         * Many times mission is “unrealistic”\n         * Can also reflect environmental and social commitments (e.g., Patagonia’s mission: “We’re in business to save our home planet”).\n* Value statement: A value statement describes and lists the fundamental values and principles that the organization operates by.\n   * Company focused\n   * Where you hope to see the business down the line\n   * Product related\n   * Can highlight sustainability commitments (e.g., responsible sourcing, reducing waste, ethical labor practices).\n* Entrepreneurs might bring up vision statements as well. A vision statement describes the ideal future state of the organization.  It articulates what the organization is trying to accomplish.\n* Ask: Why is it important to have clearly defined mission, vision, and value statements? (Customers care about consistency, trust, and whether a business is ethical, efficient, or innovative.)\n   * Have a discussion and write down all the thoughts on the board.\n   * Potential answers:\n      * Stay focused on what is really important,\n      * Businesses should be able to clearly talk about what they are trying to achieve (on a grander scale),\n      * They should have a statement to show why they exist,\n      * Having a clear statement provides direction for employees and management, \n      * Keeps businesses accountable for their environmental and social impact.\n      * Helps brands build long-term customer loyalty by aligning with sustainability values.\n      * Keeps your business customer/solution oriented instead of just focusing on profits,\n      * Communicate the company’s beliefs to employees, customers, partners, and the general public,\n      * Establish an identity, start a corporate culture,\n      * Attract like-minded employees,\n      * Aid in the decision-making process (use the mission to reflect on the companies greater goals),\n      * Keeps you thinking about the future (great leaders/organizations always are)!]]]\n   * slide 16 determine your core values content i want help updating too [[[DETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\nexamples: Innovation\nTeamwork\nCommitment...]]] and the facilitator notes [[[15 minutes: Activity\n      * Activity: What do you value?\n         1. Give out the list of verbs\n         2. Each entrepreneur should take about 5 minutes to choose all of the verbs that represent their business,\n         3. Go around the room and ask how many people have circled\n            * Some people will have few values chosen which shows that they might have a clear picture and a focus already\n            * Some people might have chosen almost all of them. In this case, point out that it is great to have so many values; however, it is hard for one business to represent them all.\n         4.

As the founder of your company, your values should be intertwined with your company values to a degree. The leadership of your company should embody the mission and values your company projects to the world. \n      * Can this change? Yes it can change; however, try to think of long lasting values that will help shape your company and its culture. These values should last far into the future. If these values are not in line with your customers and their needs, you might face problems. ]]] slide 7 is for the Unique value proposition: it's content is [[[UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:\n“A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you”]]] the facilitator notes are [[5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n         * State the definition of a value proposition and connect it to their ideas from before.\n         * Ask: \n            *  How can we actually get to our unique value proposition?

Here's how I'd restructure and update these key sections:\nRestructured Flow\n\nStart with meaning exploration - Begin with personal experiences that matter\nConnect to values - Identify the values embedded in those meaningful experiences\nTranslate to business purpose - Link these authentic values to business mission\nIdentify unique value proposition - Show how these values create distinctive advantages\n\nUpdated Content for Slide 14: Mission & Values\nCopyMISSION & VALUES: WHAT TRULY MATTERS\n\n10 minutes: Guided Reflection & Discussion\n\nAsk: \"Think about a time when your work felt deeply meaningful to you - when you felt like what you were doing really mattered. What was happening in that moment?\"\n\nFacilitate sharing of these moments, noting common themes on the board.\n\nFollow-up: \"What made these experiences meaningful? What conditions or situations created that sense of purpose?\"\n\nConnect to Mission & Values:\n- Mission is not about grand statements, but about creating the conditions for meaningful experiences\n- Values are not abstract words, but the lived priorities that show up in your meaningful moments\n- When your business creates these same meaningful conditions for customers, employees and communities, you build authentic connection\n\nExamples to share:\n- Patagonia's mission \"We're in business to save our home planet\" emerged from the founder's meaningful experiences in nature\n- Their repair program came from valuing durability and reducing waste, not from selecting \"sustainability\" from a word list\n\nAsk: \"How might creating these meaningful conditions for others also create business advantages?\"\nPotential answers:\n- Customers who share these values become loyal advocates\n- Employees find deeper motivation beyond paychecks\n- Decision-making becomes clearer and more consistent\n- Resource efficiency happens naturally when you focus on what truly matters\nUpdated Content for Slide 16: Discovering Your Core Values\nCopyDISCOVERING YOUR CORE VALUES\n\n20 minutes: Facilitated Activity\n\nIntroduction: \"Instead of selecting values from a list, we'll discover them in your most meaningful experiences.\"\n\nStep 1: Meaningful Moments (5 min - Individual)\n- Write down 2-3 specific moments when your work felt most meaningful\n- What was happening? Who was involved? What made it matter?\n\nStep 2: Identify Underlying Values (5 min - Individual)\n- For each meaningful moment, ask: \"What made this situation important to me?\"\n- What conditions or qualities were present that created meaning?\n- What would someone watching notice you cared about?\n\nStep 3: Connect to Customer Experience (5 min - Individual)\n- How might your customers experience similar meaningful moments through your business?\n- What conditions can your business create that would matter to them in similar ways?\n\nStep 4: Small Group Sharing (5 min)\n- Share your meaningful moments and the values you discovered\n- Help each other identify authentic values you might have missed\n- Discuss how these values could shape business decisions\n\nFacilitator Notes:\n- Authentic values come from lived experience, not abstract words\n- The same meaning-creating conditions that matter to you will likely matter to others\n- These authentic values will inform both your mission and your unique value proposition\n- Values aren't just what you say, but how you make decisions when trade-offs arise\nUpdated Content for Slide 7: Unique Value Proposition\nCopyUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION: MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE\n\n10 minutes: Discussion + Exercise\n\nA value proposition is a promise of meaningful value that your business delivers better than alternatives. It answers: \"Why should people choose you?\"\n\nAsk: \"How do your authentic values create a unique advantage in the market?\"\nGuide discussion to explore:\n\n1. Intersection of Meaning\n   - What meaningful experiences do your customers seek?\n   - How do your authentic values help create those experiences?\n   - What meaningful difference does your solution make compared to alternatives?\n\n2. Business Advantages\n   - Does your values-aligned approach create efficiency advantages?\n   - Can your authentic values reduce costs or risks in ways competitors can't?\n   - Do shared values with customers create stronger loyalty and reduce marketing costs?\n\nExercise:\nComplete this sentence: \"Unlike our competitors, we _____________ because we genuinely value _____________.\"\n\nExamples to share:\n- Patagonia: \"Unlike typical outdoor brands, we help you keep using what you already own because we genuinely value reducing environmental impact.\"\n- Warby Parker: \"Unlike traditional eyewear companies, we make prescription glasses accessible to more people because we genuinely value equal access to vision care.\"\nBringing It All Together: Integrated Worksheet\nI'd create a single integrated worksheet that walks participants through the full journey from meaning to business value:\nCopyMEANINGFUL BRAND DEVELOPMENT WORKSHEET\n\nPART 1: MEANINGFUL MOMENTS\nDescribe 2-3 times when your work felt truly meaningful:\n1. ________________________________________________\n2. ________________________________________________\n3. ________________________________________________\n\nWhat conditions or qualities made these experiences matter to you?\n________________________________________________\n________________________________________________\n\nPART 2: AUTHENTIC VALUES\nBased on your meaningful experiences, what do you genuinely value?\n(Not abstract words, but the specific conditions that create meaning)\n1. ________________________________________________\n2. ________________________________________________\n3. ________________________________________________\n\nPART 3: MISSION STATEMENT\nHow does your business create these same meaningful conditions for others?\n________________________________________________\n________________________________________________\n\nPART 4: UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION\n\nWhat meaningful experiences do your customers seek?\n________________________________________________\n\nHow does your business uniquely deliver these experiences?\n________________________________________________\n\nUnlike competitors, we _________________ because we genuinely value _________________.\n\nPART 5: BUSINESS ADVANTAGES\nHow do your authentic values create business benefits?\n\nLower costs: _______________________________________\n(e.g., reduced marketing costs through word-of-mouth, resource efficiency)\n\nReduced risks: _____________________________________\n(e.g., more loyal customers, more stable supply chain)\n\nMarket differentiation: _______________________________\n(e.g., clear positioning that's hard for competitors to copy)\nKey Integration Points\nTo maintain the business focus while deepening the values exploration:\n\nFrame values as business assets - Show how authentic values create tangible business advantages (lower acquisition costs, stronger loyalty, better decision-making)\nConnect values to efficiency - Demonstrate how focusing on what truly matters often leads to resource optimization (eliminating meaningless activities, focusing on essential value)\nLink values to risk reduction - Explain how values alignment creates resilience (loyal customers, motivated employees, clearer decision-making in crises)\nIntegrate values into market differentiation - Show how authentic values create hard-to-copy competitive advantages\n\nThis approach transforms values from abstract concepts to concrete business assets while ensuring they remain authentic and meaningful. By starting with real experiences that matter rather than word selection, you'll help entrepreneurs build truly distinctive businesses aligned with what they genuinely care about.\n\nHow should we reorganize our content? \nhere it is now [[[BUILDING A BRAND\n----\nAgenda\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Your brand\n9:35 | Unique value proposition\n10:35 | Break\n10:50 | Mission and values\n11:45 12:00 | Wrap up\n----\n\n\n9:00 Settle in\nTea/coffee\nCheck in, give updates, news, and answer questions \nGo around the room and share progress of entrepreneurs\nAnswer any questions about the pitch or feasibility study\n\n9:15 Begin the session\nToday during our last session, we are going to talk about building a brand. \nTodays session will be high level, so we aren’t talking about branding and marketing materials, but rather who you are in your customers eyes.

What brands do you personally connect with and why?\nAsk\nPotential answers:\nBrands that solve real problems in my life\nBrands that share my values about what matters\nBrands that help me live better according to what I care about\nBrands that are transparent and authentic\nBrands that respect my values and priorities\n\nAsk: What are the different elements of a brand? What defines a brand? What do you think of when we talk about a brand?\nPotential answers:\nCreative elements (logo, colors, marketing, etc…)\nBig companies\nConsistency\nThe name of the market or product\nThe image that comes to mind when people interact with your brand\nGood quality, (or bad quality)\nUnique\nHas creative elements (logo, name, color or font scheme, etc…)\nA company’s environmental and social commitments\n Follow-up Question: How do you see sustainability influencing customer perceptions of a brand?\nSummary: A brand is more than logo and visuals—it's a relationship based on shared values and meaningful experiences. When customers connect with your brand on a values level, they become advocates, reducing marketing costs and building resilience against market shifts.\n\n3\n\n“A brand is defined by a customers overall perception of your business.”\nWHAT IS THIS?\n8 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What does this apple mean? \nPotential answers:\nHigh quality\nProfessional\nHigh tech\nInternational\nIntelligence\nInnovation\nSteve Jobs\nI phone\nIOS\nExpensive\nMobile phones + other products like computers and tablets\nFun or games\nSneaky or annoying sometimes \nMoney driven company\nSecurity\nTrustworthy\n\nSummary: I showed you a picture of an apple, and so much came to your mind. You mentioned the products that Apple has, their founder, that they are expensive, you all have stories about this brand and feeling around it. I can show this picture to people all around the world, and there will probably be a similar response. That is a strong brand! \n\nAsk: Why is having a strong brand so important?\nPotential answers:\nIt is the identity of your business\nIt is how you will be remembered\nYou want a good brand identity, not a bad one!\nMaintaining a positive brand image is important because it will have a lasting impression on customers! They don’t forget easily and they have power!\nYou can sell a brand, not only a product\nThe strategy and actions of a business could be good or bad. These actions will define your brand and will make an impact over the next several years.\n\nRecap: Having a brand is really important for a business. It helps customers differentiate you from the competitors and remember you for what you are good at. What do we want our customers to think about when they interact with our products?\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A BRAND?\nQuality\nProducts and services\nCreative elements\nMessage\nA brand is consistent in its:\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: What is a brand\nLet people answer freely, then cover these points below as well: \nQuality: iPhones are great quality. We know this because it is consistently true. I would never buy an iPhone and question the quality of it. It is the same in every box in every country (unless it is a fake product). \nProducts and services: Apple is consistent in their products and services as well. They are a technology company. I know that they won’t be coming out with furniture or kitchenware. That would make for a very confusing brand. When creating a brand, make sure you are consistent in the things you offer as well.\nCreative elements: Commercials, marketing materials, office layout, website, Facebook, and more! Everything is in line with the same creative elements. There is a consistency with color and font schemes. Logos use and all creative elements are consistent. \nYou saw the Apple logo and knew what it was immediately. If someone took another icon of a fruit with a bite in it, many of us will think of Apple. That is a strong brand! \nMessage: Your message is consistent across all channels, internally, and externally. Whether it is your commercials, the writing on your packaging, blogs that you write, your company culture, or anything else, your message is clear and consistent. What is the problem you are solving? What does your business do? Make sure those things are clear.\n\nRecap: Apply your branding across your business and evolve it as you grow. As you grow and expand, you want to make it as easy as possible for people to know exactly what you do. If you do too much, or aren’t consistent in these points, you make it hard for people to recognize you out of the crowd.\n\n5 minutes: Brief activity\nFor each of the logos, discuss if they have a good brand or not. Try to touch on all of the four points mentioned on the slide.\n\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat is a unique value proposition?\nPotential answers could be:\nSomething that makes you unique\nA clear statement to describe what you do\nThe key offerings of your business\nIt is the point that differentiates you from your competitors\nShows why your product is better than other in the market\n\n6\n\n“A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you”\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nState the definition of a value proposition and connect it to their ideas from before.\nAsk: \n How can we actually get to our unique value proposition? Does anyone have an idea? (What makes you stand out—whether it’s pricing, durability, or an extra benefit like helping customers save resources?) The answers here will frame the next slides.\nPotential answers:\nWe get it from our research\nUsers have to tell us\nWe have to look at what is already in the market\nLook at competitors to see what they are offering and what they are good at\nWe look at our business idea and what we are good at\nWe consider whether sustainability can be a unique differentiator (e.g., eco-friendly materials, ethical supply chains, low-carbon operations, waste reduction).\n \n Discussion Prompt: Could sustainability be a part of your Unique Value Proposition? If yes, how?\n\nRecap: Over the past month, you guys have been doing a ton of research. You have done a deep dive into the market to try to identify gaps and areas of opportunity. You now know 3 important factors needed to define our UVP:\nWhat you and your business are good at\nWhat the market wants and needs\nWhat competitors are offering\n Additional Consideration: Some businesses differentiate themselves by being the \"green alternative.\" Think about how sustainability could enhance your value proposition.\n\nYour business \nand what you \ndo well\nThe market \nand customers needs \n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo first there is you. You all came in here with business ideas and you want to see if there is a market for it. You have certain:\nCapabilities\nInterests\nInformation\nA business idea \nSkills\nExperience\n\nBut you also have the market. The market has:\nPeople with changing needs, wants, desires, frustrations, etc…\nThe market can be big or small\nYour market is where you can actually reach, so it can be limited geographically\nEtc…\n\nWhat we are searching for this month, is to see if people want your idea. Based on your capabilities of developing and delivering a product, will people want what you have? And the next question, is there enough people who want it? \nThrough the animation of the circles, show:\nThe more overlap between your business idea and the needs of the market means that there is more potential for your business to succeed. \nWhen there is a small overlap (a small number of people in the market interested in your idea), there is a smaller market potential. This could be considered a niche market.\nMake sure the size of the market is worth your time and energy! Ask yourself, “is this enough for me? Will I be satisfied from the returns of this market?”\n\nYour business \nand what you\ndo well\nThe market \nand customers\nneeds\nCompetitors\nUNIQUE \nVALUE PROPOSITION\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBut there is one more thing. The market also has something else, competitors! They:\nSell other things similar to yours\nServing your customers needs now!\nDon’t serve the needs of the whole market \nYou won’t ever have the whole market\n\nBecause not everyone's needs are being met. There is an opportunity to meet those customers needs and differentiate yourself from your competitors. \n\nAsk: Based on this visual, where should you focus your energy?\nOverlap between competitors and you: Don’t go here! The market doesn’t show any desire for these things! Don’t waste your energy or time.\nOverlap between competitors and market: You could try to go here, but it could be dangerous. You are competing with your competitors on something they are really good at, and you are not good at. You might be seen as a less desirable option to your customers. Or it will take some time to be a strong competitor.\nOverlap between the three circles: This is somehow the bare minimum. Customers want it, competitors do it, and you have the capabilities for it. You should probably be doing this too. \nOverlap between you and the market: This is where you will find your unique value proposition. Customers want it, but the competitors aren’t offering it! Here is where you can really add value and differentiate yourself from your competitors.\n\nWhy choose you?\n\nWHERE DO YOU CREATE UNIQUE VALUE?\nCheaper price?\nFaster service?\nHigher quality?\n10 minutes: Discussion + Activity\n\nAsk: Keeping what we just talked about in mind, what are your value propositions? What is the promise of value you will deliver to your customers? The primary reason customers buy from you instead of your competitor?\nTake some time to think about the UVP, then have everyone share their answers.\nTrainer note: Make sure they are not just explaining their product, listing features, or creating a slogan.\n\nOther examples you can bring up if needed:\nNike offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, customization, and brand/status (https://www.cleverism.com/company/nike/).\nThe value proposition of MailChimp that they offer is simple, direct, and bold.\nApple's Iphone value proposition offers a unique experience\nUber's value proposition, offers uber convenience (https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples)\n10\n\nPOSITIONING STATEMENT TEMPLATE:\n(Target Personas)\n(Product Name)\n(Category)\n(Key Customer Benefit)\n(Nearest Competitive Alternatives)\nIs the one\nthat\nunlike\nTO\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation of Positioning statement and difference from UVP\nYour Positioning statement is a way to take your UVP and engage your customers. You are speaking to them in this statement. \nThe UVP and positioning statements are rooted in a clear understanding of your customers and what drives them emotionally\nA UVP shows what differentiates your product from your competitors’ products/services and makes it special.\nYour positioning statement captures the space you want to own in your customer’s mind, based on the unique value that you can offer.\nIf sustainability is a part of your business model, your positioning statement can reflect that.\n Trainer Notes:\n Encourage participants to think about whether sustainability could be a key differentiator in their positioning.\n Sustainability-driven positioning can help businesses attract customers who prioritize eco-friendly products and responsible brands.\n\n\nTO environmentally conscious travelers, \u000b(EcoJourney App) is the travel platform that \u000boffers authentic local experiences while also protecting the environment unlike \u000bstandard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: TO environmentally conscious travelers, \n(EcoJourney App) is the travel platform that \noffers authentic local experiences while also protecting the environment unlike \nstandard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism.\n\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\n\n12\n\nTO all global travelers, (Tourism App) is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: To all global travelers, Tourism App is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\nTO, **(EcoJourney App)** is the one travel planning platform that connects you with authentic local experiences while minimizing environmental impact, unlike standard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism regardless of its effects. \n13\n\nMISSION & VALUES\n10 minutes: Discussion\n\nMission, vision, and values\nSo, what are mission, vision, and value statements? What is the difference between them? \nWrite out their thoughts on the board separating mission and values\nMission statement: A Mission statement describes why the organization exists and why it does what it does.\nUsually is bigger than the organization itself\nMany times mission is “unrealistic”\nCan also reflect environmental and social commitments (e.g., Patagonia’s mission: “We’re in business to save our home planet”).\n\nValue statement: A value statement describes and lists the fundamental values and principles that the organization operates by.\nCompany focused\nWhere you hope to see the business down the line\nProduct related\nCan highlight sustainability commitments (e.g., responsible sourcing, reducing waste, ethical labor practices).\n\nEntrepreneurs might bring up vision statements as well. A vision statement describes the ideal future state of the organization.  It articulates what the organization is trying to accomplish.\n\nAsk: Why is it important to have clearly defined mission, vision, and value statements? (Customers care about consistency, trust, and whether a business is ethical, efficient, or innovative.)\nHave a discussion and write down all the thoughts on the board.\nPotential answers:\nStay focused on what is really important,\nBusinesses should be able to clearly talk about what they are trying to achieve (on a grander scale),\nThey should have a statement to show why they exist,\nHaving a clear statement provides direction for employees and management, \nKeeps businesses accountable for their environmental and social impact.\nHelps brands build long-term customer loyalty by aligning with sustainability values.\nKeeps your business customer/solution oriented instead of just focusing on profits,\nCommunicate the company’s beliefs to employees, customers, partners, and the general public,\nEstablish an identity, start a corporate culture,\nAttract like-minded employees,\nAid in the decision-making process (use the mission to reflect on the companies greater goals),\nKeeps you thinking about the future (great leaders/organizations always are)!\n\n14\n\n“We create happiness by providing the finest in entertainment for people of all ages, everywhere”\n“To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful”\n“Simplify life for people around the world”\nMISSION STATEMENTS:\n“We are synergizing green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues.”\n20 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\n8 minutes: Mission statements\nAsk: Take a look at these famous company mission statements. What do you see among all of them? \nPotential answers:\nMany people might reiterate some points from before\nNone of these missions state the products/services they sell\nIt is the end goal for the customers\nThey fulfill their “why”, their purpose, through their products and services\n\n10-15 minutes: Activity\nWrite your mission! So, what is it that you want to accomplish? Don’t think about money, don’t think about sustainable answers, or anything else. If you could see a change in the world that is meaningful for you, what would that look like?\nHave a few people read out their missions if they want to\n\nOther examples of mission statements:\nAmazon's mission hints at its world-ruling ambitions: \"It's our goal to be Earth's most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything online.“\nFacebook's mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.“\nUber has a simple, bold, mission: \"Transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone.“\nTwitter's mission is \"To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.“\nDropbox’s mission is to “simplify life for people around the world.\"\nKESK’s mission is to: “Synergize green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues”\n\nKESK Mission Reference: https://www.keskco.com/about\n15\n\nDETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\nInnovation\nTeamwork\nCommitment\n15 minutes: Activity\n\nActivity: What do you value?\nGive out the list of verbs\nEach entrepreneur should take about 5 minutes to choose all of the verbs that represent their business,\nGo around the room and ask how many people have circled\nSome people will have few values chosen which shows that they might have a clear picture and a focus already\nSome people might have chosen almost all of them. In this case, point out that it is great to have so many values; however, it is hard for one business to represent them all.\nGive the entrepreneurs 3 more minutes to choose only five.\n 5 minutes: Add a verb to each\nExamples: Live adventurously, create curiosity, build independence, etc…\n\nMultiply, promote, act, find, search for, establish, think, listen, laugh, hold, encourage, have, be, practice, unite, \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nShould I pick my values or company values? As the founder of your company, your values should be intertwined with your company values to a degree. The leadership of your company should embody the mission and values your company projects to the world. \nCan this change? Yes it can change; however, try to think of long lasting values that will help shape your company and its culture. These values should last far into the future. If these values are not in line with your customers and their needs, you might face problems. \n16\n\nDETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\nIntegrity\nResponsibility\nSustainability\n15 minutes: Activity\n\nActivity: What do you value?\nGive out the list of verbs\nEach entrepreneur should take about 5 minutes to choose all of the verbs that represent their business,\nGo around the room and ask how many people have circled\nSome people will have few values chosen which shows that they might have a clear picture and a focus already\nSome people might have chosen almost all of them.

      "content": "### Refining the **Mission & Values** Section for Business Utility  \n\nYour concern about **\"Mission is not about grand statements, but about creating the conditions for meaningful experiences\"** being too fluffy is valid. Entrepreneurs—especially first-time ones—tend to think about value in terms of **problem-solving, efficiency, and tangible impact** rather than abstract meaning.\n\nWe need to **connect mission and values more directly to business outcomes** while still rooting them in personal motivation and customer resonance. Below is a **reframed** approach that aligns with both **practical business strategy** and **authentic values-based branding.**\n\n---\n\n## **Updated Slide: Mission & Values – Making It Work for Your Business**\n### **Facilitator Notes:**\n#### **Mission & Values: Why They Matter in Business**\n**10-minute discussion + activity**\n\n**1. Define Mission in Practical Terms:**\n   - **\"A mission statement is not just about inspiration—it’s about defining the problem you solve and how you uniquely solve it.\"**\n   - Instead of asking \"What is meaningful to you?\" (which may seem vague), reframe it:\n     - **\"What is a problem in the world that you care enough about to build a business around?\"**\n     - **\"What do you want your customers to be able to do better because of your business?\"**\n     - **\"What needs fixing in your industry, and how does your business address that?\"**\n\n**Example (Patagonia)**\n   - Instead of saying **“We’re in business to save our home planet”** in a vague, feel-good way, explain:\n   - Patagonia saw that **outdoor gear often wears out quickly and creates waste.** They built a business model where people **repair rather than replace gear**—this both **reduces waste and saves customers money.**\n   - **They didn’t start with 'sustainability'; they started with a real problem: outdoor gear waste and cost.**\n  \n**2. Define Values in Practical Terms:**\n   - Avoid abstract words like **\"integrity, sustainability, responsibility.\"** Instead, focus on **\"How do we operate in ways that help customers trust and stay with us?\"**\n   - Ask: **\"How do we want to make decisions when things get tough?\"**\n   - Ask: **\"What do we do differently from competitors because of our values?\"**\n\n**Example (Warby Parker)**\n   - Their core value isn't just \"accessibility\"—they saw **people struggling to afford prescription glasses.**\n   - **Business decision:** They created a **direct-to-consumer model that drastically reduced costs.**\n   - **Values-based advantage:** Customers felt they were supporting a company that made good glasses affordable.\n\n---\n\n## **Updated Slide: Exercise – Connecting Mission, Values & Business Impact**\n### **Facilitator Notes:**\n#### **Mission & Values Discovery Activity (15 min)**\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Problem You Solve (5 min)**\n- Ask each participant:\n  - **What problem do you care enough about to build a business around?**\n  - **What challenges do your ideal customers face?**\n  - **How will your business make their lives easier or better?**\n\n**Examples:**\n- A restaurant startup:\n  - **Problem:** Healthy food is expensive and inconvenient for busy professionals.\n  - **Solution:** Create a **fast, nutritious meal service at a lower cost than competitors.**\n- A sustainable fashion brand:\n  - **Problem:** Most clothes are cheap but wear out fast, leading to waste.\n  - **Solution:** Offer **durable, stylish clothes with a repair or trade-in option.**\n- A tech product:\n  - **Problem:** Small businesses struggle with marketing automation tools because they’re too complex.\n  - **Solution:** Build an **AI-powered tool that automates marketing without requiring technical expertise.**\n\n### **Step 2: Extract Core Business Values (5 min)**\n- Ask:\n  - **How does your business operate differently because of what you value?**\n  - **What principles shape your decision-making and customer experience?**\n\n**Examples:**\n- **\"We prioritize quality over low prices\"** (not just \"integrity\").\n- **\"We make our products repairable instead of disposable\"** (not just \"sustainability\").\n- **\"We help customers be more self-sufficient\"** (not just \"empowerment\").\n- **\"We are transparent about our pricing and process\"** (not just \"honesty\").  \n\n### **Step 3: Write Your Mission Statement (5 min)**\n- **Template:**  \n  **\"We exist to [solve this problem] for [these customers] by [how you solve it uniquely].\"**  \n  - Example: **\"We exist to help busy professionals eat healthy without overpaying by offering nutritious, affordable meal subscriptions.\"**\n  - Example: **\"We exist to make stylish, long-lasting fashion accessible while reducing clothing waste.\"**\n\n---\n\n## **Updated Slide: Values as a Competitive Advantage**\n### **Facilitator Notes**\n**5-minute discussion**\n- **Reframe values as a competitive strategy.**\n  - **How do your values create a business edge?**\n  - **Can they reduce costs or improve efficiency?**\n  - **Do they make your business more resilient?**\n  - **How do they increase customer trust and loyalty?**\n\n**Examples:**\n1. **Durability saves customers money** → **Patagonia's \"Don’t Buy This Jacket\" campaign actually increased sales.**\n2. **Affordability through smart business models** → **Warby Parker’s direct-to-consumer model reduced costs, allowing them to give away a free pair for every purchase.**\n3. **Tech-enabled sustainability** → **Tesla’s core value isn’t just “green energy”—it’s making electric cars perform better and faster than gasoline cars.**\n\n---\n\n### **How This Revision Improves the Session**\n1. **Mission is framed in a way that aligns with solving real-world problems.**\n   - Instead of asking **“what is meaningful to you?”**, the question is **“what problem do you care enough to build a business around?”**\n2. **Values are practical and strategic, not abstract.**\n   - Instead of picking words from a list, values emerge from **how decisions are made and what sets the business apart.**\n3. **Values connect directly to competitive advantage.**\n   - Values are not just \"feel-good\" but **drive efficiency, differentiation, and loyalty.**\n\nThis revision keeps everything **practical, clear, and connected to business success** while still integrating **authenticity and purpose.** Let me know if you want additional refinements!",

      "content": "i got this recommendation:\n[[[I've reviewed your \"Building A Brand\" presentation slides, and I see the issue with your values section. Currently, the approach seems overly prescriptive with values presented as a simple list selection (Innovation, Teamwork, Commitment, etc.). This doesn't help entrepreneurs connect authentically to what truly matters to them or their potential customers.\nHere's how you could improve this section to make the values process more meaningful:\nReplace the Value List Selection with Meaningful Experience Exploration\nInstead of having entrepreneurs select from a predetermined list of values, guide them through a reflective process that helps them discover authentic values from their own meaningful experiences:\n\nBegin with meaningful moments: Ask participants to recall 2-3 specific moments when their work felt deeply meaningful - times when they felt their work truly mattered. Have them write these down in detail.\nExtract what mattered: For each meaningful moment, have them reflect on what specifically made it meaningful. What conditions were present? What was happening that created that sense of purpose?\nConnect to customer experience: Ask how their customers might experience similar meaningful moments through their business. What conditions can their business create that would matter to others?\nIdentify patterns: Look across these reflections to identify recurring themes that represent their authentic values - not just words, but the actual conditions that create meaning.\n\nFramework for the Exercise\nCreate a worksheet with prompts like:\n\n\"Describe a specific time when your work felt deeply meaningful to you.\"\n\"What specifically made this moment matter to you?\"\n\"What would someone observing notice you cared about in this moment?\"\n\"How might your customers experience something similarly meaningful through your business?\"\n\nFacilitate Small Group Sharing\nAfter individual reflection, have entrepreneurs share in small groups to help each other identify values they might have missed and discuss how these authentic values could shape business decisions.\nConnect to Business Advantage\nHelp entrepreneurs see how these authentic values create business advantages:\n\nCustomers who share these values become loyal advocates\nDecision-making becomes clearer when based on what truly matters\nResource efficiency happens naturally when focusing on meaningful outcomes\n\nExample to Share\nInstead of generic value examples, share a concrete story of how a successful business discovered their values through meaningful experiences:\n\"Patagonia's commitment to environmental sustainability didn't come from selecting values from a list - it emerged from the founder's meaningful experiences in nature and seeing environmental degradation firsthand. Their repair program came from valuing durability and reducing waste, not from selecting 'sustainability' from a word list.\"\nThis approach will help entrepreneurs develop values that are authentic, meaningful, and actually guide their business decisions, rather than just picking nice-sounding words from a predetermined list.\n\nHere's a targeted before-and-after approach to fix the highest pain points in your values-related slides without changing too much:\nBEFORE AND AFTER: KEY SLIDE UPDATES\nSLIDE 17: DETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES (Current)\nBefore:\n\nTitle: \"DETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\"\nThree values with icons: \"Innovation\", \"Teamwork\", \"Commitment\"\nApproach: Appears to be a selection from pre-determined values\n\nAfter:\n\nKeep the same title and visual layout\nReplace instruction text to: \"DISCOVER YOUR AUTHENTIC VALUES:\"\nAdd brief subtitle: \"Start with meaningful experiences, not abstract words\"\nKeep same icons but change labels to guiding questions:\n\n\"What moments felt most meaningful in your work?\"\n\"What conditions were present that created that meaning?\"\n\"How could your business create those conditions for others?\"\n\n\n\nSLIDE 18: MORE VALUES (Current)\nBefore:\n\nTitle: \"DETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\"\nThree more values with icons: \"Integrity\", \"Responsibility\", \"Sustainability\"\nApproach: More predetermined values to select from\n\nAfter:\n\nChange title to: \"CONNECT VALUES TO BUSINESS ADVANTAGE:\"\nKeep same icons but add text under each that connects values to business benefits:\n\nUnder Integrity icon: \"Builds customer trust and loyalty\"\nUnder Responsibility icon: \"Creates resilient relationships\"\nUnder Sustainability icon: \"Reduces costs and future risks\"\n\n\nAdd small note: \"Values come from what truly matters, not just words that sound good\"\n\nADD NEW SLIDE 18b: MEANINGFUL VALUES WORKSHEET\nNew Slide Between 18-19:\n\nTitle: \"VALUES THAT DRIVE DECISIONS\"\nContent: A simple 3-step worksheet format:\n\n\"Describe a specific time when your work felt deeply meaningful\"\n\"What specifically made this moment matter to you?\"\n\"How might your customers experience something similarly meaningful?\"\n\n\nBottom section: \"Share your meaningful moments with your group. Help each other identify the authentic values behind these experiences.\"\n\nSLIDE 19: STARBUCKS EXAMPLE (Current)\nBefore:\n\nShows Starbucks mission and values as a reference example\nLists their values statements\n\nAfter:\n\nKeep the Starbucks example but add brief context:\nAdd subtitle: \"VALUES IN ACTION: Notice how Starbucks values emerged from meaningful experiences\"\nAdd small callout: \"These aren't just nice words - they guide real business decisions like store design, hiring practices, and community engagement\"\nHighlight one concrete example of how a specific value translates to business practice\n\nSLIDE SEQUENCE AND TIMING\n\nKeep slides 1-16 as they are (branding concepts, UVP, positioning)\nReplace slide 17 with the improved version focusing on discovering authentic values\nReplace slide 18 with the improved version connecting values to business advantage\nAdd new slide 18b with the values worksheet for a brief hands-on exercise\nUpdate slide 19 (Starbucks example) with the improved context\nKeep slides 20-21 as they are (conclusion slides)\n\nThis targeted approach fixes the most problematic aspects of the values section while maintaining the overall structure and flow of your presentation. The changes shift from a \"pick from a list\" approach to a more authentic discovery process without requiring a complete redesign of your materials.]]]issue is that the whole part about \"What moments felt most meaningful in your work?\n\nWhat conditions were present that created that meaning\n\nHow could your business create those conditions for others?\" doesn't seem to make sense - what about solving problems? it should be connected to care, compassion for the person feeling the problem, authentically living it yourself and not wanting anyone else to, etc - along with things like meaningful moments at work - also, these are earyl stage entrepreneurs who aren't working yet - so they might not know, this exercise might be early for them, how can we adapt?\n\nHere's my new slides now - it's a mess help me clean it out. Identify my goal and strategy and help me clean this up: [[[BUILDING A BRAND\n----\nAgenda\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Your brand\n9:35 | Unique value proposition\n10:35 | Break\n10:50 | Mission and values\n11:45 12:00 | Wrap up\n----\n\n\n9:00 Settle in\nTea/coffee\nCheck in, give updates, news, and answer questions \nGo around the room and share progress of entrepreneurs\nAnswer any questions about the pitch or feasibility study\n\n9:15 Begin the session\nToday during our last session, we are going to talk about building a brand. \nTodays session will be high level, so we aren’t talking about branding and marketing materials, but rather who you are in your customers eyes. Once that fundamental point is clear, then you can create all that other material to help you visualize your brand.\n1\n\nSESSION OBJECTIVES:\nUnderstand how to use your brand to communicate.\n\nDefine your unique value proposition.\n\nWrite mission and vision statements for your brand. \n1 minute: Objectives\nUnderstand how to use your brand to communicate: You’ve gathered all this information, now we are going to try and define our business in a way that will resonate with your customer base.\nDefine your unique value proposition: Pinpoint the key area of your business that makes you unique.\nWrite your mission and vision statements for your business:  This is to have a clear written mission that is aligned with your brand. \n\n2\n\nBRAND CHAT\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: \"What brands do you connect with personally?

What defines a brand? What do you think of when we talk about a brand?\nPotential answers:\nCreative elements (logo, colors, marketing, etc…)\nBig companies\nConsistency\nThe name of the market or product\nThe image that comes to mind when people interact with your brand\nGood quality, (or bad quality)\nUnique\nHas creative elements (logo, name, color or font scheme, etc…)\nA company’s environmental and social commitments\n Follow-up Question: How do you see sustainability influencing customer perceptions of a brand?\nSummary: A brand is more than logo and visuals—it's a relationship based on shared values and meaningful experiences. When customers connect with your brand on a values level, they become advocates, reducing marketing costs and building resilience against market shifts.\n\n3\n\nELEMENTS OF YOUR BRAND\n\nAsk: What are the different elements of a brand?

You mentioned the products that Apple has, their founder, that they are expensive, you all have stories about this brand and feeling around it. I can show this picture to people all around the world, and there will probably be a similar response. That is a strong brand! \n\nAsk: Why is having a strong brand so important?\nPotential answers:\nIt is the identity of your business\nIt is how you will be remembered\nYou want a good brand identity, not a bad one!\nMaintaining a positive brand image is important because it will have a lasting impression on customers! They don’t forget easily and they have power!\nYou can sell a brand, not only a product\nThe strategy and actions of a business could be good or bad. These actions will define your brand and will make an impact over the next several years.\n\nRecap: Having a brand is really important for a business. It helps customers differentiate you from the competitors and remember you for what you are good at. What do we want our customers to think about when they interact with our products?\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A BRAND?\nQuality\nProducts and services\nCreative elements\nMessage\nA brand is consistent in its:\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: What is a brand\nLet people answer freely, then cover these points below as well: \nQuality: iPhones are great quality. We know this because it is consistently true. I would never buy an iPhone and question the quality of it. It is the same in every box in every country (unless it is a fake product). \nProducts and services: Apple is consistent in their products and services as well. They are a technology company. I know that they won’t be coming out with furniture or kitchenware. That would make for a very confusing brand. When creating a brand, make sure you are consistent in the things you offer as well.\nCreative elements: Commercials, marketing materials, office layout, website, Facebook, and more! Everything is in line with the same creative elements. There is a consistency with color and font schemes. Logos use and all creative elements are consistent. \nYou saw the Apple logo and knew what it was immediately. If someone took another icon of a fruit with a bite in it, many of us will think of Apple. That is a strong brand! \nMessage: Your message is consistent across all channels, internally, and externally. Whether it is your commercials, the writing on your packaging, blogs that you write, your company culture, or anything else, your message is clear and consistent. What is the problem you are solving? What does your business do? Make sure those things are clear.\n\nRecap: Apply your branding across your business and evolve it as you grow. As you grow and expand, you want to make it as easy as possible for people to know exactly what you do. If you do too much, or aren’t consistent in these points, you make it hard for people to recognize you out of the crowd.\n\n5 minutes: Brief activity\nFor each of the logos, discuss if they have a good brand or not. Try to touch on all of the four points mentioned on the slide.\n\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION\n10 minutes: Discussion + Exercise\n\nA value proposition is a promise of meaningful value that your business delivers better than alternatives. It answers: \"Why should people choose you?\"\n\nAsk: \"How do your authentic values create a unique advantage in the market?\"\nGuide discussion to explore:\n\n1. Intersection of Meaning\n   - What meaningful experiences do your customers seek?\n   - How do your authentic values help create those experiences?\n   - What meaningful difference does your solution make compared to alternatives?\n\n2. Business Advantages\n   - Does your values-aligned approach create efficiency advantages?\n   - Can your authentic values reduce costs or risks in ways competitors can't?\n   - Do shared values with customers create stronger loyalty and reduce marketing costs?\n\nExercise:\nComplete this sentence: \"Unlike our competitors, we _____________ because we genuinely value _____________.\"\n\nExamples to share:\n- Patagonia: \"Unlike typical outdoor brands, we help you keep using what you already own because we genuinely value reducing environmental impact.\"\n- Warby Parker: \"Unlike traditional eyewear companies, we make prescription glasses accessible to more people because we genuinely value equal access to vision care.\"\n\n\u000bOriginal [[[5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat is a unique value proposition?\nPotential answers could be:\nSomething that makes you unique\nA clear statement to describe what you do\nThe key offerings of your business\nIt is the point that differentiates you from your competitors\nShows why your product is better than other in the market\n]]]\n7\n\n“A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you”\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nState the definition of a value proposition and connect it to their ideas from before.\nAsk: \n How can we actually get to our unique value proposition? Does anyone have an idea? (What makes you stand out—whether it’s pricing, durability, or an extra benefit like helping customers save resources?) The answers here will frame the next slides.\nPotential answers:\nWe get it from our research\nUsers have to tell us\nWe have to look at what is already in the market\nLook at competitors to see what they are offering and what they are good at\nWe look at our business idea and what we are good at\nWe consider whether sustainability can be a unique differentiator (e.g., eco-friendly materials, ethical supply chains, low-carbon operations, waste reduction).\n \n Discussion Prompt: Could sustainability be a part of your Unique Value Proposition? If yes, how?\n\nRecap: Over the past month, you guys have been doing a ton of research. You have done a deep dive into the market to try to identify gaps and areas of opportunity. You now know 3 important factors needed to define our UVP:\nWhat you and your business are good at\nWhat the market wants and needs\nWhat competitors are offering\n Additional Consideration: Some businesses differentiate themselves by being the \"green alternative.\" Think about how sustainability could enhance your value proposition.\n\nYour business \nand what you \ndo well\nThe market \nand customers needs \n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo first there is you. You all came in here with business ideas and you want to see if there is a market for it. You have certain:\nCapabilities\nInterests\nInformation\nA business idea \nSkills\nExperience\n\nBut you also have the market. The market has:\nPeople with changing needs, wants, desires, frustrations, etc…\nThe market can be big or small\nYour market is where you can actually reach, so it can be limited geographically\nEtc…\n\nWhat we are searching for this month, is to see if people want your idea. Based on your capabilities of developing and delivering a product, will people want what you have? And the next question, is there enough people who want it? \nThrough the animation of the circles, show:\nThe more overlap between your business idea and the needs of the market means that there is more potential for your business to succeed. \nWhen there is a small overlap (a small number of people in the market interested in your idea), there is a smaller market potential. This could be considered a niche market.\nMake sure the size of the market is worth your time and energy! Ask yourself, “is this enough for me? Will I be satisfied from the returns of this market?”\n\nYour business \nand what you\ndo well\nThe market \nand customers\nneeds\nCompetitors\nUNIQUE \nVALUE PROPOSITION\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBut there is one more thing. The market also has something else, competitors! They:\nSell other things similar to yours\nServing your customers needs now!\nDon’t serve the needs of the whole market \nYou won’t ever have the whole market\n\nBecause not everyone's needs are being met. There is an opportunity to meet those customers needs and differentiate yourself from your competitors. \n\nAsk: Based on this visual, where should you focus your energy?\nOverlap between competitors and you: Don’t go here! The market doesn’t show any desire for these things! Don’t waste your energy or time.\nOverlap between competitors and market: You could try to go here, but it could be dangerous. You are competing with your competitors on something they are really good at, and you are not good at. You might be seen as a less desirable option to your customers. Or it will take some time to be a strong competitor.\nOverlap between the three circles: This is somehow the bare minimum. Customers want it, competitors do it, and you have the capabilities for it. You should probably be doing this too. \nOverlap between you and the market: This is where you will find your unique value proposition. Customers want it, but the competitors aren’t offering it! Here is where you can really add value and differentiate yourself from your competitors.\n\nWhy choose you?\n\nWHERE DO YOU CREATE UNIQUE VALUE?\nCheaper price?\nFaster service?\nHigher quality?\n10 minutes: Discussion + Activity\n\nAsk: Keeping what we just talked about in mind, what are your value propositions? What is the promise of value you will deliver to your customers? The primary reason customers buy from you instead of your competitor?\nTake some time to think about the UVP, then have everyone share their answers.\nTrainer note: Make sure they are not just explaining their product, listing features, or creating a slogan.\n\nOther examples you can bring up if needed:\nNike offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, customization, and brand/status (https://www.cleverism.com/company/nike/).\nThe value proposition of MailChimp that they offer is simple, direct, and bold.\nApple's Iphone value proposition offers a unique experience\nUber's value proposition, offers uber convenience (https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples)\n11\n\nPOSITIONING STATEMENT TEMPLATE:\n(Target Personas)\n(Product Name)\n(Category)\n(Key Customer Benefit)\n(Nearest Competitive Alternatives)\nIs the one\nthat\nunlike\nTO\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation of Positioning statement and difference from UVP\nYour Positioning statement is a way to take your UVP and engage your customers. You are speaking to them in this statement. \nThe UVP and positioning statements are rooted in a clear understanding of your customers and what drives them emotionally\nA UVP shows what differentiates your product from your competitors’ products/services and makes it special.\nYour positioning statement captures the space you want to own in your customer’s mind, based on the unique value that you can offer.\nIf sustainability is a part of your business model, your positioning statement can reflect that.\n Trainer Notes:\n Encourage participants to think about whether sustainability could be a key differentiator in their positioning.\n Sustainability-driven positioning can help businesses attract customers who prioritize eco-friendly products and responsible brands.\n\n\nTO environmentally conscious travelers, \u000b(EcoJourney App) is the travel platform that \u000boffers authentic local experiences while also protecting the environment unlike \u000bstandard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: TO environmentally conscious travelers, \n(EcoJourney App) is the travel platform that \noffers authentic local experiences while also protecting the environment unlike \nstandard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism.\n\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\n\n13\n\nTO all global travelers, (Tourism App) is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: To all global travelers, Tourism App is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\nTO, **(EcoJourney App)** is the one travel planning platform that connects you with authentic local experiences while minimizing environmental impact, unlike standard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism regardless of its effects. \n14\n\nMISSION & VALUES\nMISSION & VALUES: WHAT TRULY MATTERS\n\n10 minutes: Guided Reflection & Discussion\n\nAsk: \"Think about a time when your work felt deeply meaningful to you - when you felt like what you were doing really mattered. What was happening in that moment?\"\n\nFacilitate sharing of these moments, noting common themes on the board.\n\nFollow-up: \"What made these experiences meaningful? What conditions or situations created that sense of purpose?\"\n\nConnect to Mission & Values:\n- Mission is not about grand statements, but about creating the conditions for meaningful experiences\n- Values are not abstract words, but the lived priorities that show up in your meaningful moments\n- When your business creates these same meaningful conditions for customers, employees and communities, you build authentic connection\n\nExamples to share:\n- Patagonia's mission \"We're in business to save our home planet\" emerged from the founder's meaningful experiences in nature\n- Their repair program came from valuing durability and reducing waste, not from selecting \"sustainability\" from a word list\n\nAsk: \"How might creating these meaningful conditions for others also create business advantages?\"\nPotential answers:\n- Customers who share these values become loyal advocates\n- Employees find deeper motivation beyond paychecks\n- Decision-making becomes clearer and more consistent\n- Resource efficiency happens naturally when you focus on what truly matters\n\nOriginal: [[[\u000b10 minutes: Discussion\n\nMission, vision, and values\nSo, what are mission, vision, and value statements? What is the difference between them? \nWrite out their thoughts on the board separating mission and values\nMission statement: A Mission statement describes why the organization exists and why it does what it does.\nUsually is bigger than the organization itself\nMany times mission is “unrealistic”\nCan also reflect environmental and social commitments (e.g., Patagonia’s mission: “We’re in business to save our home planet”).\n\nValue statement: A value statement describes and lists the fundamental values and principles that the organization operates by.\nCompany focused\nWhere you hope to see the business down the line\nProduct related\nCan highlight sustainability commitments (e.g., responsible sourcing, reducing waste, ethical labor practices).\n\nEntrepreneurs might bring up vision statements as well. A vision statement describes the ideal future state of the organization.  It articulates what the organization is trying to accomplish.\n\nAsk: Why is it important to have clearly defined mission, vision, and value statements? (Customers care about consistency, trust, and whether a business is ethical, efficient, or innovative.)\nHave a discussion and write down all the thoughts on the board.\nPotential answers:\nStay focused on what is really important,\nBusinesses should be able to clearly talk about what they are trying to achieve (on a grander scale),\nThey should have a statement to show why they exist,\nHaving a clear statement provides direction for employees and management, \nKeeps businesses accountable for their environmental and social impact.\nHelps brands build long-term customer loyalty by aligning with sustainability values.\nKeeps your business customer/solution oriented instead of just focusing on profits,\nCommunicate the company’s beliefs to employees, customers, partners, and the general public,\nEstablish an identity, start a corporate culture,\nAttract like-minded employees,\nAid in the decision-making process (use the mission to reflect on the companies greater goals),\nKeeps you thinking about the future (great leaders/organizations always are)!\n]]]\n15\n\n“We create happiness by providing the finest in entertainment for people of all ages, everywhere”\n“To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful”\n“Simplify life for people around the world”\nMISSION STATEMENTS:\n“We are synergizing green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues.”\n20 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\n8 minutes: Mission statements\nAsk: Take a look at these famous company mission statements. What do you see among all of them? \nPotential answers:\nMany people might reiterate some points from before\nNone of these missions state the products/services they sell\nIt is the end goal for the customers\nThey fulfill their “why”, their purpose, through their products and services\n\n10-15 minutes: Activity\nWrite your mission! So, what is it that you want to accomplish? Don’t think about money, don’t think about sustainable answers, or anything else. If you could see a change in the world that is meaningful for you, what would that look like?\nHave a few people read out their missions if they want to\n\nOther examples of mission statements:\nAmazon's mission hints at its world-ruling ambitions: \"It's our goal to be Earth's most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything online.“\nFacebook's mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.“\nUber has a simple, bold, mission: \"Transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone.“\nTwitter's mission is \"To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.“\nDropbox’s mission is to “simplify life for people around the world.\"\nKESK’s mission is to: “Synergize green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues”\n\nKESK Mission Reference: https://www.keskco.com/about\n16\n\nDETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\nInnovation\nTeamwork\nCommitment\n15 minutes: Activity\n\nActivity: What do you value?\nGive out the list of verbs\nEach entrepreneur should take about 5 minutes to choose all of the verbs that represent their business,\nGo around the room and ask how many people have circled\nSome people will have few values chosen which shows that they might have a clear picture and a focus already\nSome people might have chosen almost all of them. In this case, point out that it is great to have so many values; however, it is hard for one business to represent them all.\nGive the entrepreneurs 3 more minutes to choose only five.\n 5 minutes: Add a verb to each\nExamples: Live adventurously, create curiosity, build independence, etc…\n\nMultiply, promote, act, find, search for, establish, think, listen, laugh, hold, encourage, have, be, practice, unite, \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nShould I pick my values or company values? As the founder of your company, your values should be intertwined with your company values to a degree. The leadership of your company should embody the mission and values your company projects to the world. \nCan this change? Yes it can change; however, try to think of long lasting values that will help shape your company and its culture. These values should last far into the future. If these values are not in line with your customers and their needs, you might face problems. \n17\n\nDISCOVER YOUR AUTHENTIC VALUES\nWhat moments felt most meaningful in your work?\nWhat conditions were present that created that meaning\nHow could your business create those conditions for others?\nStart with meaningful experiences, not abstract words\nWe need to replace this - takes too long and is too abstract and will be hard for young first time entrepreneurs : [[[20 minutes: Facilitated Activity\n\nIntroduction: \"Instead of selecting values from a list, we'll discover them in your most meaningful experiences.\"\n\nStep 1: Meaningful Moments (5 min - Individual)\n- Write down 2-3 specific moments when your work felt most meaningful\n- What was happening?

      "content": "### **Refining Your Session 8: Clarifying Goals and Strategy**\n\nThe **main issue** with the current structure is that it tries to force entrepreneurs into discovering values from personal experience **before they have a clear problem-solving focus.** This doesn't work well for early-stage entrepreneurs who haven't yet built businesses. We need to **reframe values as principles that emerge from solving problems, rather than just personal meaning.**\n\n### **🔹 Your Revised Goal & Strategy for Session 8**\n1. **Goal:** Help early-stage entrepreneurs **articulate their brand** based on their business idea, customer needs, and what drives them.\n2. **Strategy:**  \n   - **Start with the problem:** Define what they care about solving.  \n   - **Connect to customer pain points:** Show why their solution matters.  \n   - **Identify values through decision-making:** Values emerge from how they want to operate differently, not just personal reflection.  \n   - **Tie it all to business benefits:** Show how values create loyalty, efficiency, and differentiation.\n\n---\n\n## **🔹 Revised Session Flow**\n\n### **🟢 9:00 – Settle In & Check-In**\n- Entrepreneurs share updates, questions, and challenges related to their business.\n- Facilitator reminds them: **\"Today, we’ll refine how your brand communicates what you stand for, the problem you solve, and how customers experience that in your business.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **🟢 9:15 – Defining Your Brand: Beyond Just a Logo**\n**(Discussion – 10 min)**  \n👉 **Ask:** “What brands do you connect with personally? Why?”  \n👉 **Potential Answers:**  \n   - Solves a real problem I have  \n   - Aligns with what matters to me  \n   - Helps me live better  \n   - Feels authentic and trustworthy  \n   - Uses resources wisely  \n\n**📌 Summary:** A brand isn’t just a logo—it’s **how customers experience your business.** If they trust you and feel your business improves their lives, they’ll stay loyal.\n\n---\n\n### **🟢 9:30 – Unique Value Proposition: Start with the Problem**\n**(Lecture + Discussion – 10 min)**  \n👉 **Ask:** “What problem does your business solve?”  \n👉 **Ask:** “What makes your approach different?”  \n👉 **Discuss:** The intersection of:  \n   - **What you’re good at**  \n   - **What your market needs**  \n   - **What competitors fail to do**  \n\n👉 **Mini Exercise:**  \n**“Unlike our competitors, we ______ because we genuinely value ______.”**  \n   - Example: **\"Unlike traditional gyms, we offer low-cost group training because we value accessibility and community support.\"**  \n   - Example: **\"Unlike cheap fast food, we provide affordable, healthy meals because we value nutrition and convenience.\"**\n\n📌 **Takeaway:** Your **UVP** isn’t just a pitch—it’s a **promise of value** driven by your **real priorities.**\n\n---\n\n### **🟢 10:00 – The Role of Mission & Values: Decision-Making, Not Just Words**\n**(Lecture + Discussion – 15 min)**  \n👉 **Reframe mission:**  \n   - **Instead of vague purpose:** “Our mission is to make lives better by ___.”  \n   - **Ground it in action:** “We do this by solving ___ with ___.”  \n\n👉 **Reframe values:**  \n   - **Instead of abstract ‘integrity’ or ‘innovation’, ask:**  \n     - “What kind of decisions feel right for your business?”  \n     - “How do you want customers and employees to feel about working with you?”  \n\n**Examples:**  \n✔ **\"We design products to last, not be replaced, because we value sustainability.\"**  \n✔ **\"We price honestly and fairly because we value long-term relationships over quick profits.\"**  \n✔ **\"We focus on simple, high-quality ingredients because we value health.\"**  \n\n📌 **Takeaway:** Your **mission guides WHAT you do. Your values guide HOW you do it.**  \n\n---\n\n### **🟢 10:30 – Values in Action: How They Shape Business Success**\n**(Discussion – 10 min)**  \n👉 **Ask:** “How do strong values help a business succeed?”  \n👉 **Examples:**  \n   - Lower marketing costs (loyal customers spread the word).  \n   - Customers trust brands with **clear, honest values.**  \n   - Strong values help **attract the right employees & investors.**  \n\n📌 **Takeaway:** Values aren’t just ideals—they **increase business efficiency, resilience, and long-term success.**\n\n---\n\n### **🟢 10:40 – BREAK (10 min)**\n\n---\n\n### **🟢 10:50 – Expressing Your Brand Clearly: Writing Your Mission & Values**\n**(Activity – 15 min)**  \n\n📌 **Step 1: Define Your Problem & Solution**  \n👉 Ask:  \n   - “What big problem do you care enough about to build a business around?”  \n   - “How does your business help people?”  \n\n📌 **Step 2: Values in Action**  \n👉 **Ask:**  \n   - “How do your values show up in how you solve this problem?”  \n   - “What kind of choices will you make because of these values?”  \n\n📌 **Step 3: Write Your Mission & Values**  \n**Mission Template:**  \n👉 \"We exist to [solve this problem] for [these people] by [unique solution].\"  \n\n**Values Template:**  \n👉 “We prioritize ___ because we believe ___.”  \n\n✔ **Example:** “We prioritize affordability because we believe good food shouldn’t be a luxury.”  \n✔ **Example:** “We prioritize durable materials because we believe fashion shouldn’t contribute to waste.”  \n\n📌 **Takeaway:** A strong **mission + values** help customers understand **why they should trust your business.**\n\n---\n\n### **🟢 11:10 – Business Advantage of Strong Values**\n**(Discussion – 10 min)**  \n👉 Ask: \"What happens when a company acts on its values?\"  \n👉 Discuss:  \n   - Patagonia (repair program → customer loyalty).  \n   - Tesla (fast, fun electric cars → changed perception of sustainability).  \n   - Local café (fair wages → loyal staff & customers).  \n\n📌 **Takeaway:** When values **drive action**, they become a **competitive advantage.**  \n\n---\n\n### **🟢 11:25 – Refining Your Brand Positioning Statement**\n**(Activity – 15 min)**  \n📌 **Final Exercise:**  \n👉 **Fill in the blanks:**  \n“To **[your target customers]**, **[your company name]** is the **[category]** that **[solves problem]** because we **[value]**, unlike **[competitor].**”  \n\n✔ **Example:**  \n   - “To busy professionals, **FitBites** is the meal service that **delivers healthy, affordable meals fast** because we **value nutrition and time**, unlike **expensive meal prep services.**”  \n   - “To young entrepreneurs, **CoLab Spaces** is the co-working hub that **fosters collaboration and mentorship** because we **value community-building**, unlike **rigid office rentals.**”  \n\n📌 **Takeaway:** This is **your brand promise in one sentence.**\n\n---\n\n### **🟢 11:45 – Wrap-Up**\n- **Recap key takeaways:**  \n   - Your **brand is about how people experience your business.**  \n   - **Your UVP is a promise—what makes you different.**  \n   - **Your mission & values shape real decisions.**  \n   - **Strong values = business efficiency & trust.**  \n- **Invite 1-2 participants to share their positioning statement.**  \n\n📌 **Final Encouragement:**  \n\"Customers trust businesses that **clearly stand for something.** Your job isn’t to impress everyone—it’s to be **authentic to the people who need what you offer most.**\"\n\n---\n\n### **🔹 Summary of Key Changes**\n✅ **Replaced vague “meaningful experiences” with “problem-solving focus”**  \n✅ **Tied values to decision-making & customer trust**  \n✅ **Simplified activities for early-stage entrepreneurs**  \n✅ **Reorganized session flow for better clarity & engagement**  \n\nThis structure **keeps it practical, connects values to business success, and ensures the session stays action-driven.**  \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! 🚀",

This flow **honors authenticity** while **remaining practical** for early-stage entrepreneurs.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Clarify the Core Principle: Values as Sources of Meaning**\n\n**Slide Title:**  \n**“Values as Sources of Meaning—Why They Matter for Your Brand”**\n\n**Facilitator Talking Points (2–3 minutes):**  \n- **Explain Joe Edelman’s concept**: “Values are not just words on a wall; they reflect the underlying motivations that give our work meaning.”  \n- **Professional Framing**: “When your values are authentically expressed in your business, they become a source of genuine customer and employee connection—not mere marketing.”\n\n**Key Points to Emphasize**:  \n1. **Authentic vs. Instrumental**: Values should not be chosen purely to chase trends; they should emerge from what genuinely matters to you and your team.  \n2. **Values = Lived Principles**: They manifest in decisions, behaviors, and the way customers experience your brand.  \n3. **Brand Trust & Loyalty**: People sense authenticity. If your values are truly lived out, customers are more likely to trust and remain loyal.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Connect Values to a Broader Purpose (Mission)**\n\n**Slide Title:**  \n**“From Values to Purpose: Defining Your Mission”**\n\n**Facilitator Talking Points (5–7 minutes):**  \n- **Professional Angle**: “Your mission statement explains why you exist and what change you want to see in the world, guided by your core values.”  \n- **Tie to Joe Edelman**: “Rather than focusing solely on ‘problems’ or ‘profit opportunities,’ reflect on the deeper motivation: *Which human experiences, needs, or aspirations do you care about fulfilling?*”\n\n**Guided Questions**:  \n1. **“Which human values motivate you to work on this idea?”**  \n   - (e.g., fairness, belonging, empowerment, health, curiosity)  \n2. **“How do these values shape your sense of purpose?”**  \n   - (e.g., “I believe people deserve to feel safe and empowered when managing their finances.”)\n\n**Activity Suggestion** (Individual Reflection or Small Group Share):  \n- **Prompt**: “Name one or two core values you deeply care about. How do they inform the purpose behind your business idea?”  \n- **Outcome**: Participants begin to articulate a *mission statement* that resonates on a personal (values-based) and practical (market) level.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Bridge Values to Customer Relevance**\n\n**Slide Title:**  \n**“Why Customers Care: Aligning Values with Real Needs”**\n\n**Facilitator Talking Points (5 minutes):**  \n- **Professional Explanation**: “Authentic values don’t just inspire you internally; they also resonate with customers who share or appreciate those values.”  \n- **Joe Edelman Emphasis**: “Values matter because they reflect what genuinely motivates you to serve your customers in a way competitors cannot replicate.”\n\n**Key Distinction**:  \n- **Not purely ‘problem-based’**: “Solving a customer’s problem is crucial, but how you solve it and *why* you care sets you apart.”  \n- **Values → Unique Experience**: “If you value ‘dignity’, you might design products with inclusive features; if you value ‘transparency’, you’ll have open pricing or sourcing.”  \n\n**Reflective Question**:  \n- “In what ways do your values translate into a customer experience that feels different or more meaningful than a competitor’s?”\n\n---\n\n## **4. Positioning: Expressing Values in Your UVP**\n\n**Slide Title:**  \n**“Crafting a UVP that Reflects Your Authentic Values”**\n\n**Facilitator Talking Points (5 minutes):**  \n- **Definition Reminder**: “A Unique Value Proposition states why a customer should choose you over alternatives.”  \n- **Professional + Values**: “We strengthen it by weaving in the deeper motivation behind what you do.”\n\n**UVP Formula Revision** (with a values twist):  \n> **“To [Target Customer], [Your Company] is the [Category] that [Practical Benefit], because we believe in [Core Value], unlike [Competitor/Market Status Quo].”**\n\n**Example**:  \n> “To ethically minded shoppers, EcoWear is the clothing line that balances style and durability, because we believe in preserving resources for future generations, unlike fast fashion brands that prioritize quick turnover.”\n\n---\n\n## **5. Mission, Vision, and Values: Making Them Actionable**\n\n**Slide Title:**  \n**“Turning Values into Real Business Practices”**\n\n**Facilitator Talking Points (5–7 minutes):**  \n- **Keep it Professional and Concrete**: “A list of values is meaningless if it doesn’t guide daily decisions and business processes.”  \n- **Joe Edelman’s Emphasis on Meaning**: “Your values should inform how you choose suppliers, set prices, design your product, and treat customers.”\n\n**Discussion**:  \n- **“How will these values influence hiring, product design, marketing, or partnerships?”**  \n- **“What trade-offs might you face, and how will your core values guide your decisions?”**\n\n---\n\n## **6. Practical Exercise: Values in Decision-Making**\n\n**Slide Title:**  \n**“Workshop: From Values to Real Decisions”**\n\n**Activity Outline (10–15 minutes)**:  \n1. **Scenario**: Present a hypothetical challenge (e.g., a supply chain issue, a potential investor wanting you to cut corners).  \n2. **Ask**: “Which of your stated values is relevant here?”  \n3. **Group Discussion**: “How would you act on that value? What business advantage or risk do you foresee?”\n\n**Outcome**:  \n- Participants see how **values guide real-world decisions** and create trust or differentiation.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Summarize the Business Case for Values**\n\n**Slide Title:**  \n**“Why All This Matters: The Business Case for Authentic Values”**\n\n**Facilitator Talking Points (5 minutes)**:  \n1. **Differentiation**: Competitors can copy features, but not your genuine values.  \n2. **Customer Trust & Loyalty**: When customers sense authenticity, they become advocates.  \n3. **Employee Engagement**: People want to work for companies that reflect their own values.  \n4. **Market Resilience**: Clear values make it easier to pivot or innovate without losing brand identity.\n\n---\n\n## **8. Wrap-Up & Next Steps**\n\n**Slide Title:**  \n**“Moving Forward: Refining Your Brand with Authentic Values”**\n\n**Facilitator Recap (5 minutes):**  \n- **Emphasize**: “Values-based branding isn’t ‘fluffy.’ It’s about clarifying *why* you do what you do and how that *uniquely* benefits customers.”  \n- **Action Step**: “Finalize a draft of your mission and UVP that clearly integrates the values you care about. Share them with peers or mentors for feedback.”\n\n---\n\n### **How This Revised Approach Balances Authenticity and Professionalism**\n\n1. **Authentic, Not Instrumental**: We **start with values** as genuine motivations (Joe Edelman’s perspective) and then show **how** they drive real business benefits—rather than using them as a gimmick.  \n2. **Professional Language**: We keep a clear, structured format, weaving in values with problem-solving talk without sounding too casual or purely emotional.  \n3. **Practical Application**: We anchor values in **decision-making, customer experience,** and **competitive advantage**, ensuring entrepreneurs see them as **tangible business tools** rather than abstract ideals.  \n4. **Early-Stage Ready**: We acknowledge some participants don’t have extensive “work experience” yet. The exercises center on **personal motivations** and **visions** of what they want to create, bridging the gap between aspiration and real-world brand strategy.\n\nThis integrated method ensures you **honor Joe Edelman’s vision** of values as sources of meaning *and* remain pragmatic and professional for entrepreneurs working on their very first ventures.",

How are you doing today?\nToday, we will talk about business ethics and how to incorporate ethics and sustainability\ninto your business model.\n1\nEstablish a clear understanding of what business ethics is.\nIdentify why & how to integrate triple bottom line thinking (People, Planet, and Profit)\ninto a business model.\nFormulate a plan to build resilience and measure impact.\n1 minute: Objectives\nEstablish a clear understanding of what business ethics is.\nIdentify ways to include the triple bottom line into your business model\nFormulate a plan to create and measure impact.\n2\nWHAT ARE ETHICS?\n15 Minutes: Discussion - Ethics: Living Values That Ignite Business\nKickoff (2-3 minutes):\n\"Let's discuss ethics as a foundation for aligning your business with authenticity,\npurpose, and resilience. Ethics aren’t just rules to follow—they represent your deeper\n'why' and drive your business forward, especially in challenging times.\n\"\nDiscussion Questions (10 minutes):\nWhen someone says 'ethics,\n' what's the first thing that comes to your mind?\nHow can authenticity provide your business with unique advantages that competitors\ncan't easily replicate?\nWhat impact does alignment with a founder's deepest values have on business\nsuccess?\nCan you recall a moment when you felt genuinely alive and motivated by your work?\nHow can that kind of energy enhance business performance?\nHave you seen examples where businesses succeeded specifically because they stayed\ntrue to their core values? What happened?\nWho are the stakeholders impacted by your business (customers, employees, local\ncommunity, environment)? Why does considering their well-being contribute to your\nlong-term success?\nEncourage participants to share real examples—situations where businesses either lost\ntrust by cutting corners or built loyalty by sticking firmly to their values.\nAs the conversation progresses, highlight the two fundamental approaches to ethics:\nWrap-Up Points (2-3 minutes):\n\"We've talked about two main pathways businesses can take regarding\nethics—Compliance-based and Values-based. Let's briefly explore each:\"\nCompliance-Based Ethics: Playing Safe\nDoing what's legally required—meeting regulations and avoiding penalties.\nPrimarily focused on avoiding problems and doing no harm.\nLimitations: Laws differ by location, and simply following rules doesn't create deeper\nconnections with customers or employees.\nValues-Based Ethics: Igniting Purpose\nGoing beyond compliance because you have a meaningful purpose and clear core\nvalues.\nActing authentically, proactively, and ethically—even when nobody is\nwatching—because your 'why' genuinely drives you.\nWillingness to put in extra effort aligned with your values, making your work more\npurposeful and fulfilling.\nWhy Values Ignite Your Business:\nCustomer Connection: People support businesses whose values align with theirs.\nAuthenticity builds trust, loyalty, and lasting customer relationships.\nTeam Loyalty: Employees remain engaged and motivated when their work serves a\nmeaningful purpose beyond financial compensation.\nLong-term Resilience: Businesses guided by strong, clear values can more effectively\nadapt to challenges and thrive amid uncertainty.\nCompetitive Edge: Authenticity differentiates your business clearly and powerfully in\ncrowded markets.\nClosing Thought:\nWe aren't just building startups—we're cultivating purpose-driven businesses that attract\ncustomers, inspire communities, and stand the test of time. Ethics, grounded in\nauthenticity and values, can become your a strategic advantage.\nAs Epictetus famously said:\n\"First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to.\n\"\n3\n5 Minutes: Discussion - Ethics: Living Values That Ignite Business Continued\nDiscussion Questions (2-3 minutes):\nWhat is your strong why? What “why” will keep you going when things are hard? What\nvalues and ethical ways of doing business will inspire you, help you find aligned funders,\nteam members and customers?\n4\n3-5 minutes: Discussion:\nAsk: What do you think about this video? How do you think it was received by the\npublic?\n3 minutes: Lecture\nShare some actual figures about this video:\n$101,000 budget to make the video\n+$150,000,000 in returns\n3x more views than some Super Bowl commercials\nThis video caused the largest traffic spike to their website\nTheir story was featured all over the news and on shows like Ellen.\n5\n“Brands with a purpose grow faster”\nUNILEVER STRATEGY\n5 minutes: Lecture\nUnilever is the +$62.6 billion/yr company that owns Dove and many other international\nbrands.\nAfter researching, they discovered with bottom line evidence that “Brands with a purpose\ngrow faster” (twice as fast for some of their companies). Their internal data showed that\n15% of growth came from brands that had a purpose. Therefore, they made a strategic\ndecision to adjust their strategy to make sure that all of their brands have an activated\nbrand purpose.\n“The cost of inaction is a lot more than taking action”\n- Jonathan Atwood VP of\ncommunications and sustainable living at Unlilever.\nShort discussion: Can you think of a business you interact with because you align with\ntheir values and purpose?\n6\nMcDonalds, Green and Healthy?\n3-5 minutes: Discuss\nIs McDonald's known to be a green and healthy restaurant?\nWhy did McDonalds go “green” in Europe?\nIs this an authentic display of McDonald’s core values? Why or why not?\n7\nFROM WORDS TO PURPOSE\nInnovation\nTeamwork\nCommitment\nIntegrity\nResponsibility\nFacilitator Notes (1-2 minutes):\nOpen with challenge: \"Every business claims values like these on their website. But\nwhen do these words actually matter? What makes the difference between empty\nstatements and values that guide real decisions?\"\nQuick example: McDonald's painted arches green and added salads, claiming\nenvironmental values—but their core business remains unchanged\"\nGo To Slide 10\n8\nCompany\nClaimed Values\nActual Practices\n🚫 McDonald's\nSustainability, Health\nMinimal menu changes; superficial “green” initiatives; continues to rely heavily on\nunhealthy, highly processed foods.\n🚫 Volkswagen (Dieselgate)\nIntegrity, Responsibility\nLied about emissions software, lost public trust and environmental claims.\n✅ Patagonia\nSustainability, Responsibility\nTransparent supply chain; promotes repair over replacement; donates profits to\nenvironmental protection.\n✅ Tony’s Chocolonely\nFairness, Integrity\nActively combats slavery in chocolate industry; transparent about challenges and\nsolutions.\nFROM WORDS TO PURPOSE\nFacilitator Notes (2-3 minutes):\nDiscuss: \"Think about your stated values. What would it look like if these weren't just\nwords but the heartbeat of your business? What would your customers notice and miss if\nyou were gone tomorrow?\"\nBridge to next slide: \"Your values matter only when they guide real choices and actions.\nThings people can see, hear, share. Actions that connect with people, profit, and\nplanet—what we call the triple bottom line. That's where we're headed next.\n\"\n9\nWHO ARE YOUR STAKEHOLDERS?\nPEOPLE\nPLANET\nPROFIT\n2-3 minutes: Lecture\nAs a business, you will have an impact on so many different people just by existing. You\nhave an impact on your customers, your employees, the shareholders of your company,\nthe communities you operate in, and the planet we live on. This impact could be positive\nor negative and it all depends on the choices you make as the leader of your company.\nTherefore, you should actively think through how your business decisions will impact all\nof your different stakeholders.\nWe will look at the triple bottom line business model to do this. When you think of a\n“bottom line”\n, traditionally that means a solely profit driven business (bottom line of a\nP&L), but there are businesses who are driven for other reasons as well (people driven\ncompanies, environmentally driven companies, etc…)\nOver the next few slides, spend time in each category to brainstorm things entrepreneurs\ncan do right now or in the near future to be more ethical and ultimately, more sustainable\nin these 3 categories (representing the Triple Bottom Line model):\nPeople\nPlanet\nProfit\nTrainer tip: Over the next few slides, try to avoid answers such as “make donations” or\n“give away free products”\n. Those things are great, but try to get the entrepreneurs to\nthink about how their core of their business’ existence can be rooted in uplifting the\nworld. Donations and giveaways are great, but they aren’t sustainable on their own. We\nwill discuss “good answers” on the next slides. These things can include using less\nplastic in packaging, having a transparent and fair hiring process, etc…).\n10\nPEOPLE\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\nHave a discussion on ways to positively impact all the people who interact with your\nbusiness or are impacted by it in some way.\nWrite all the answers on the board.\nAs people share answers, try to go deeper and show how these “ethical” actions actually\nhave a positive impact on your business as well\nAsk: What are things that your business can do to have a positive impact on people?\nPotential answers:\nCommunity:\nEducational events and workshops related to your mission for community members,\ncustomers, employees, etc…\nPartnerships and collaborations with other businesses or organizations working towards\nthe same mission\nHire from your local community. Job creation stimulates growth.\nHire vulnerable or marginalized people\nTackle social issues through company policy and actions\nEmployees:\nPay employees well\nGive employees benefits\nProvide education or personal development opportunities\nEnsure fair (or good) hours and working conditions\nCustomers:\nYour business should be solving a problem for them\nYour products should be safe and not cause any harm\nListen and respect them\nExamples you can give:\nChobani Yogurt has a policy to hire refugees which positively affects society\nStarbucks has a policy to hire veterans and refugees. They also have policies to prevent\nfood waste and give food to people in need within their communities.\nTrainer tip: If entrepreneurs are having a hard time coming up with answers, consider\nasking “What are some ethical companies you know about? How do they treat their\nemployees and community? What do they do that inspires you?\n11\nPROFIT\n5 minutes: Discussion\nIn the triple bottom line model, profits are important, but not always the driving force. At\nthe end of the day, you have to remember that you have to make a profit. It is great to do\ngood, but if you can’t sustain yourself your business won’t last.\nAsk: How can you actually implement some of those ideas from before while also\nkeeping profitability in mind?\nPotential answers:\nConduct a cost benefit analysis on the ideas to see which owns are most “beneficial”\nOnly do things that you can afford to do\nFind other companies or organizations to donate to your cause and\nIntegrate ethics into your business model in a way that ethical behavior is always\nprofitable!\nEtc…\nMore information on the examples you from the “People slide”:\nChobani Yogurt has a policy to hire refugees which positively affects society (this does\nnot affect profits at all)\nStarbucks has a policy to hire veterans and refugees. They also have policies to prevent\nfood waste and give food to people in need within their communities. (these decisions\nhave actually had a positive effect on Starbucks profitability from the good publicity)\n12\nPLANET\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\nHave a discussion on ways to positively impact all the environment and planet with your\nbusiness.\nWrite all the answers on the board.\nAs people share answers, try to go deeper and show how these “ethical” actions actually\nhave a positive impact on your business as well\nAsk: What are things that your business can do to have a positive impact on the planet?\nPotential answers:\nConsider circular business models that use a different way of producing and consuming\ngoods to be more environmentally friendly and “circular” (in a way that mimics natures).\nThis can include using recycled materials in production or incentivizing customers to\nreturn products to the company where it can be refurbished or reused in another way\n(circular model). Avoid extracting things from the earth, giving it to the customers, and\nputting it in a landfill (this is a linear model).\nRecycle when you can\nReduce consumption and try to conserve natural resources\nReuse when you can instead of creating more waste\nRepair old or broken materials instead of throwing them out\nDonate excess materials/goods instead of throwing them out\nStreamline processes and remove unnecessary steps\nThink of ways to have a better impact on water & air quality,\nTrainer tip: If entrepreneurs are having a hard time coming up with answers, consider\nasking “What are some ethical companies you know about? What do they do to\npositively impact the environment? What do they do that inspires you?\n13\nLIVING YOUR VALUES, NOT JUST MARKETING THEM\nFacilitator Notes (5 minutes: Discussion)\n\"We've talked about finding values that truly matter to you and activating them through\nthe triple bottom line. But in a world where 'ethical' and 'green' have become marketing\nbuzzwords, how do businesses that genuinely live their values stand out from those just\nwearing the costume?\"\nTransition: This disconnect between what companies claim and what they do has a\nname: 'greenwashing' or 'ethics washing.\n' It happens when values become marketing\ntools rather than authentic guides for decisions.\nAsk: \"How can your business demonstrate that your values run deeper than marketing?\nHow do you build trust that your 'why' is genuine?\"\nGuide toward concrete answers:\n\"Make choices that might cost you something in the short term but align with your\nvalues\"\n\"Be transparent about both your successes and challenges\"\n\"Invite verification through certification programs relevant to your sector:\"\nISO standards for quality and environmental management\nOrganic certification for food products\nFair Trade for ethical supply chains\nB Corporation certification for overall social and environmental performance\nConnect back to meaning: The strongest businesses don't just meet standards—they set\nthem based on what truly matters to them. When values come from an authentic source\nof meaning, customers don't just see compliance—they feel your authentic purpose and\nbuilds loyalty that marketing can't buy.\nApplication: Now, thinking about your specific business and the values we've been\ndiscussing, what's one concrete action you could take this month that would\ndemonstrate your commitment isn't just talk?\n14\nFROM VALUES TO IMPACT\nMEASURE WHAT MATTERS\nACTIVATING YOUR BRAND PURPOSE:\nFacilitator Notes (5 minutes: Introduction & Set-Up)\nClearly connect this activity to the previous discussions:\nWe've talked extensively about ethics, authenticity, and avoiding greenwashing/values\nwashing. Now it’s time to put this into action. Real business ethics means aligning what\nyou say (your values) with what you actually do. Let's move beyond words and create a\nconcrete, measurable way to activate your brand purpose.\nGuiding Questions (for entrepreneurs):\nWhat problem are you genuinely solving?\nWho benefits directly from your solution (customers, employees, community)?\nBased on your authentic core values, what three meaningful impacts do you want your\nbusiness to have in the world?\nActivity Instructions (1 hour):\nClearly list your core values and your deeper \"why\" behind your business.\nIdentify at least three measurable actions your business can take that authentically\nembody these values and positively impact your stakeholders (People, Planet, Profit).\nDescribe specific ways you will measure and communicate these impacts:\nConsider customer surveys, storytelling, transparency initiatives, and formal impact\nreports.\nExplore widely recognized third-party certifications and assessments, such as:\nISO standards\nFair Trade Certification\nOrganic Certification\nLEED Certification\nRainforest Alliance\nB Corporation Certification\nTake the B Impact Assessment:\nLog in or create an account at B Impact Assessment.\nWork through the questions relevant to your business. It's okay if you don't know all the\nanswers yet—use this as a tool to identify areas where you can integrate stronger\npractices and measurements aligned with your values.\nNote: A score of 80 or above indicates passing, and it is a challenging benchmark!\nGroup Activity (15 minutes: Small Group Discussions)\nBreak into groups of 3-5.\nShare your identified impacts, strategies, and measurement ideas.\nProvide and receive feedback: Are these strategies aligned clearly with your core\nmission and values? Are they realistically achievable and measurable?\nTrainer Tip: Encourage entrepreneurs to focus deeply on practical and meaningful\nmetrics—ones that genuinely resonate with investors, customers, and stakeholders,\ndemonstrating authenticity beyond superficial marketing.\n15\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS:\nUpdate your mission statement (if necessary)\nFinish the B Impact Assessment.\nIdentify 3 areas of impact that you care about and want to measure.\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n16\nTHANK YOU\nANY QUESTIONS?\n5 minutes: Wrap up]]] that's how we talk about it much later on - find the minimum changes here / clean changes that can help find this balance",

      "content": "Below is a **“minimal changes”** approach that weaves in **authentic, values-based** thinking without overhauling your entire deck. It keeps things **professional and practical** while ensuring entrepreneurs grasp that **values are deeper than a word list**—they guide real decisions, connect to a purpose (problem-solving), and build trust. \n\n---\n\n## 1. **Add a Brief Note on “Authentic Values”** in the “Determine Your Core Values” Slides\n\n**Current Slides:**  \n- Slides 16 and 17 feature a values word list and an activity where people pick from it.  \n\n**Minimal Update:**\n1. **Change Slide 16 Title** from **“DETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES”** to  \n   **“DETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES: ALIGNING WHAT MATTERS TO YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS.”**\n\n2. **Add a short facilitator note** (1–2 lines) under the instructions:\n   > **Facilitator Note:** “Encourage participants to reflect on the real motivation behind each selected value. For instance, if they choose ‘Responsibility,’ ask: *Which group or problem do you feel responsible for?* or *How does this value show up in the way you solve a customer’s challenge?* This ensures the values aren’t just words but reflect genuine priorities that will guide decisions.”\n\n3. **In the slide text** (under or instead of the bullet list of examples):\n   > **“Remember: Values are not just buzzwords. They should reflect what truly matters to you and how you want to impact your customers and community. A strong ‘why’ behind each value will help you make consistent, authentic decisions.”**\n\nThat single change moves participants from simply picking words to **connecting each chosen value to a deeper reason**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Adjust Slide 17 (“DISCOVER YOUR AUTHENTIC VALUES”)** to a Simpler, Forward-Looking Prompt\n\n**Current Slide Text:**  \n> *“What moments felt most meaningful in your work? … How could your business create those conditions?”*\n\n**Problem:** Early-stage entrepreneurs may not have much prior “work” to draw from.\n\n**Minimal Update:**  \nReplace the bullet prompts with **future-oriented** questions about why they are building this venture and who they want to serve:\n\n```\n1. What motivated you to start (or consider) this venture in the first place?\n2. Which issues, people, or communities do you care about helping?\n3. How do you want your customers, team, or community to feel when they interact with your business?\n4. Which principles or standards do you refuse to compromise on, even if it means slower growth or higher costs?\n```\n\nFinish with a line:\n> “These reflections will help you discover values that aren’t just words, but guiding principles that shape how you solve problems and engage your customers.”\n\nThis slight rewording keeps it **simple, forward-looking**, and **connects to authenticity** without requiring prior work experience.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Mission & Values Slide (Slide 14) – Small Facilitator Note on ‘Problem + Authenticity’**\n\n**Current Slide Text Sample:**  \n> *“Think about a time when your work felt deeply meaningful to you…”* and references Patagonia, etc.\n\n**Minimal Update:**  \nRight after introducing mission statements, insert a **brief** facilitator instruction:\n\n> **Facilitator Note:**  \n> “When drafting your mission, don’t just think about ‘what problem you solve.’ Ask yourself *why* you care about this problem or market gap in the first place. Your mission should reflect both **the change you want to create** and **the authentic values that motivate you** to pursue it.”\n\nThis reminds them their “why” needs to be **personally meaningful**, not just instrumental.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **One-Liner Under the UVP Slides About Values**\n\nWhere you talk about unique value propositions (Slides 6–7), **add a single bullet**:\n\n> **“When forming your UVP, weave in how your core values shape a unique experience. For example, if you value ‘transparency,’ emphasize user-friendly pricing or open communication as part of your UVP.”**\n\nThis takes **one line** and neatly connects values to practical differentiation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Optional Tie-In to Business Ethics (1–2 lines)**\n\nSince you eventually cover ethics and the triple bottom line in later sessions, **add a small “preview”** slide or note (wherever it feels natural) that says:\n\n> **“A strong brand flows from authentic values. Later, we’ll see how these same values can guide your ethical choices, sustainability commitments, and long-term impact—what some call the Triple Bottom Line (People, Planet, Profit). For now, focus on clarifying which values truly matter to you so your brand stands on a real foundation.”**\n\nThis **short mention** seamlessly foreshadows your ethics module without complicating the brand session too much.\n\n---\n\n# Putting It All Together: A Concise Summary\n\n1. **Slide 16 Title** → “DETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES: ALIGNING WHAT MATTERS.”  \n   - Add a **facilitator note** prompting participants to connect each chosen value to a personal “why.”\n\n2. **Slide 17 Prompts** → Make them **future-focused** for early-stage founders:\n   - *“What motivated you to start this venture?”*  \n   - *“Who or what do you care about helping?”*  \n   - *“How do you want customers/employees to feel?”*  \n   - *“Which principles would you never compromise?”*\n\n3. **Mission & Values Slide (14)** → Insert **one facilitator note** reminding them the mission should reflect both **problem-solving** and **personal meaning**.\n\n4. **UVP Slides (6–7)** → Add **one bullet** about how **authentic values** create a distinctive customer experience.\n\n5. **Quick Tie-in** to future ethics content → A single line or short slide about **“We’ll expand on these values when we discuss ethics, sustainability, and the triple bottom line later.”**\n\nThese modest tweaks keep your presentation format **intact**, provide **enough guidance** for authenticity and meaning, and remain **practical, business-oriented,** and **simple to implement** for early-stage entrepreneurs.",
