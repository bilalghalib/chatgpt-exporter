I understand hearing several things at different times was a lot to handle&c;a& and scary. It made you wonder how much more there was to reveal&c;a& if it would ever end.\n\nI can't change the past&c;a& my mistakes&c;a& nor how I shared&c;a& when and how much. I can assure you that the shift was real though.\n\nThe night I broke down and felt like I was dying&c;a& dreaming of you handing me a razor blade was absolutely terrifying. I can't prove to you the fact that it changed me profoundly. I can simply say it. It broke me open for the best&c;a& as in: being really and completely honest&c;a& facing my darkness&c;a& choosing what to do with that&c;a& and setting my intentions for the rest of my life.\n\nEventually I chose to forgive myself and understand what led me to do such disgusting things. All our discussions helped me a lot to draw and understand a clear picture of the large context in which these mistakes took place.\n\nI know you're never done growing&c;a& learning and refining. I also know this time was a stepping stone.\n\nPart of me is proud of where I stand today&c;a& for not killing nor hating myself&c;a& but being able to forgive and love better.\n\nAll of me is deeply sad and disappointed for hurting you so badly.\n\nDespite all this&c;a& I chose with my whole heart to want to be in a relationship with you&c;a& this time knowing much more precisely what I can/cannot handle&c;a& what I need&c;a& and what I want to build together.\n\nDespite time being rather short between the revelation and the proposal&c;a& I thought this was a good way to get a feel for how you want to move forward. I felt comfortable with asking - I actually felt at peace and inspired.\n\nI know for a fact that being chosen wholeheartedly is crucial to me. I know I will lose interest in our relationship by being tolerated rather than loved and cared for.\n\nIn the very beginning&c;a& the new me would have left or spoke up. I am choosing to accept the last five years for what they are: unsuccessful attempts at loving.\n\nWhen you create something&c;a& you go through iterations&c;a& you throw away the first attempts (or keep it on the shelf because you actually care about seeing the work in progress!) and eventually come closer to the ideal you have.\n\nI think our ideals were not aligned. Are they today?\n\nCan we craft together with the same/a similar definition of what beauty and love are?\n\nFirst and foremost: how engaged are we today?\n\n——————————————————————-\n\nIt’s not just how/when you unfolded things&c;a& I am surprised that you knew how hurt I was from the time with Chris\n\nHow hard it hit me\n\nI don’t think anything besides my nervous breakdown last summer about the hundreds of thousands of dead people in Iraq has ever hit me that hard. Kind of selfish I guess\n\nAnyway&c;a& it hurts.\n\nAnd what sometimes comes into my mind is - she saw me like that&c;a& and did things //again// after that. Many times. I know you were different then&c;a& and the first time (that you told me) probably was some sort of special situation. And knowing that and knowing that it happened again within a year&c;a& just does not compute for me.\n\nI understand your transformation probably feels real to you. I also know that change is hard. And people don’t really change a whole lot&c;a& not after a certain age. It’s possible&c;a& lots of people have transformations when they convert or leave their homes&c;a& and I see myself at least when I watch myself&c;a& I’m a goofy creative person and I fall back to that always.\n\nIt’s interesting&c;a& you’re giving me what you want most&c;a& to be in a relationship with me. In terms of revelations and moving forward&c;a& I wanted to be engaged and live together (closer) for a year before getting married because I knew my feelings take about a year after each previous revelation to come to some sort of steady state. I guess we’re halfway through this time&c;a& although it’s not getting calmer&c;a& I’m feeling more and more upset. I’m feeling betrayed in a way that something I desperately wanted&c;a& to feel deeply in love and to be able to articulate it honestly&c;a& each time is taken away from me&c;a& and it makes me feel quite angry&c;a& surprised&c;a& and helpless. It’s what I want too&c;a& to be honestly able to say loving things&c;a& and love you&c;a& and hold you and be happy and it takes me a long time to let go of fear (first time) let go of disgust (second time) and now my anger and disgust and fear is feeling less hot and doesn’t shake me. It just feels pointless. In my mind I can hear things like&c;a& she can do whatever she wants&c;a& I don’t care. I am feeling apathetic&c;a& rather than hurt&c;a& unless I thin about it or talk about it then I’m surprised and angry again&c;a& more surprised by the fact that I haven’t left and angry that my rare moments of honest expression of love were stolen from me.\n\nThis is what’s happening now for me and I said yes to the proposal because I wanted to move forward and ease in after the second series of revelations that happened in Beirut. And then the third the day before felt like a trap&c;a& because there was no turning back.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to bode well for our marriage. What a start&c;a& huh?\n\nI wonder what it would be like&c;a& or if it’s possible to break the rock crusted anger and surprise and resentment I feel and get to the core of the living parts again. At least when the lava was flowing I could see I also cared. Now I just want to cry at my loss. I’m not closing the door to forgiving you and not feeling upset towards you&c;a& it is a bit mixed up when you want me to do things to help you feel safer in life and in the relationship and I feel trapped in this position&c;a& and one day I can feeling no hard feelings between us. Is it possible for me to get to the point of loving again? Well&c;a& I know empathy is required&c;a& and each time I was so sorry for how things were going and the hurt you must have felt and I remember being able to understand and temper my hurt by understanding you. As hurt as I was I also cared. I’m not sure why that empathy is so much harder to feel. Maybe because the last revelation was earlier? Before I had a chance to hurt you so it was random? Perhaps because they kept coming&c;a& and the last one was sort of like a trap. Perhaps because now it just doesn’t even seem comparable anymore and I gave you enough excuses. I don’t know I’m trying to understand right now while writing…. I’m not attempting to be mean&c;a& and I don’t mean to come off as hopeless&c;a& I’m just opening up my mind to see what I don’t let myself sometimes even say to myself so perhaps we can find a way forward.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n1KaXDvNY4X4MEyftz2xmq76UdZUseHiE68\n\nI think I had no idea that I wanted to be chosen (openly so&c;a& clearly) and that my partner wouldn't have romantic/deep/time consuming relationships with other women.\n\nAlso didn't think it was that important for my partner to commit clearly&c;a& to know what he wants&c;a& and to act on it with no hesitation.\n\nI knew a feeling of settling was and is important to me&c;a& and that was lacking from the start in all aspects of our relationship. I was aware of that&c;a& and I didn't know if/when you'd want to be more settled. Hence: the marriage proposal as an opportunity to really find out.\n\nWhat made you say \"you're giving me what you want most: to be in a relationship with me\"?\n\nLet me correct something: What I want most (in terms of relationships) is to be with someone who dedicates him/herself to being loving and caring. To be there no matter what.\n\nThis is what I am trying to give you&c;a& and it doesn't feel like you want it - makes sense&c;a& today.\n\nI think I could have set my Sway profile as \"only looking for long term exclusive relationships\"&c;a& had I known that's what I wanted. As you say: I am surprised I didn't leave. I care about you too&c;a& but that's not what made me stay: I can recognize now I was simply too scared to leave. I had found something exciting and meaningful&c;a& even if it was painful. The thrill was worth it apparently.\n\nDo you really think I wanted to be a mean person? I know you are not&c;a& I think no one really wants to be mean&c;a& except rare occasions maybe&c;a& but that's not us. I hurt you because I was hurt&c;a& with no intention to hurt you. The only time I hurt you intentionally was in Berlin&c;a& after spending time with Lisa and we were in that hotel room at night. I felt so disrespected and hurt I remember hitting your leg. I was very angry&c;a& and immediately regretted.\n\nI am not evil. I care for you&c;a& and I am damn clumsy. I have a hard time being articulate and understanding my needs and emotions. And I am also brave and willing to make things nice no matter what it takes&c;a& as long as there is respect. Maybe we're simply too different&c;a& incompatible in terms of what we need and have to offer. Maybe timing was off all along.\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nPromotes respect for human rights 2019-06-12 19:23:17 5Promotes respect for human rights\n\n3.5 trillion dollars in management -\n\nInvestor responsibility to uphold human rights\n\nSupport investors in engaging companies on human rights and due diligence\n\nWork with investors to activate their leverage to bring\n\n2018 - ICT - investor engagement on human rights\n\nAlliance to work with civil society - identify salient risks / impact on people - engage companies/inside/outside strategies\n\nSycamore asset management\n\nGNI SVP caliber investment\n\nInstitutional investors invest other people’s money in different asset classes\n\nInvestors have a responsibility inline\n\nOECD guidlines\n\nWhat it looks like for investors to be responsible business actors.\n\nInvestors need to consider human rights criteria throughout the investment lifecycle\n\nInvest/ornot and then engage the company - identify risks on salient\n\nInvestors can file shareholder resolutions\n\nAsking for human rights impact\n\nPromote public policies\n\nAsset managers\n\nFaith based institutions\n\nTarget the investors that are not acting responsibly\n\nRobeko middle sized asset manager in nederlands\n\n3-4-5k companies worldwide - part of the active ownership team\n\nEnvironmental social govornance - tracking - 14 people work on these issues.

It is Aurélien Devernois who presents with me this edition. Good evening Aurélien.\n\nAurélien Devernois:  Good evening.\n\nLB:  In the headlines tonight: Venezuela and the ultimatum of European countries coming to an end. 7 countries&c;a& including France&c;a& had given Nicolas Maduro this evening to call for a new presidential election.\n\nAD:  In El Salvador&c;a& the presidential election is precisely this Sunday. 5 million voters go to the polls. For the first time&c;a& he is a centrist who is a favorite of polls.\n\nLB:  And then we'll come back to this announcement from Benyamin Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister says he is ready to use force against Iran&c;a& which has just announced the test of a long-range missile.\n\n\\-----\n\nAD:  First of all&c;a& Venezuela&c;a& where President Nicolas Maduro has once again proposed legislative elections. While several countries of the European Union are asking for a presidential election.\n\nLB:  This is Germany&c;a& Spain&c;a& France&c;a& Netherlands&c;a& Portugal&c;a& United Kingdom and Austria. In contrast&c;a& Russia&c;a& China&c;a& North Korea&c;a& Turkey or Cuba support Nicolas Maduro who rejects the ultimatum of European countries that had given him until tonight to organize the election otherwise they recognize self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido. Moreover&c;a& this crisis in Venezuela has significantly reduced the return to the country of the currencies. This weekend&c;a& the company Noor Capital&c;a& based in Abu Dhabi&c;a& has finally confirmed having conducted a gold exchange for foreign exchange on behalf of the Republic of Venezuela. An operation carried out in the legality and in the respect of the international law according to this company&c;a& but which raises many criticisms from the part opposed to the power in place. The explanations of  Romain Lemaresquier.\n\nIt is the American senator Marco Rubio&c;a& a great critic of the regime of Nicolas Maduro&c;a& who had revealed the affair on social networks. And after a long silence: Noor Capital has finally confirmed having purchased 3 tons of gold reserves of the Venezuelan central bank&c;a& in exchange for foreign currency. An operation much criticized by the slayers of the Chavista regime who accuse Noor Capital of allowing the survival of a financially depressed regime. After recognizing this transaction&c;a& Noor Capital announced that it would no longer conduct any such transactions with the Venezuelan State until the situation stabilized. An announcement that puts an end to two other operations that were to be conducted soon according to Reuters. A total of 29 tons of gold were to be sold. 15 tons were expected to be shipped to the United Arab Emirates soon&c;a& while another 11 tons were to be sold in mid-February. Operations scrutinized especially by the United States who warned the banking institutions not to do business with Venezuelan gold. The flight of capital is one of the recurring themes in this Venezuelan crisis. And even within the Venezuelan central bank a resistance seems to be put in place. Some employees refuse that Venezuelan assets be squandered. Moreover&c;a& two of them were fired last week because they refused to let the gold out of the banking institution.\n\nLB:  I would add that Donald Trump reiterated that recourse to the US military in Venezuela was \"an option\" considered in the face of the political crisis that is shaking the country.\n\nAD:  In El Salvador&c;a& some 5 million voters have gone to the polls to elect their next president.\n\nLB:  Since the end of the civil war in 1992&c;a& two parties share the power: the ARENA&c;a& right&c;a& the ARENA&c;a& and the left party the FMLN&c;a& but today it is a candidate who is positioned rather in the center which is widely favored polls. His name is Nayib Bukélé&c;a& the GANA coalition candidate. He has campaigned on social networks&c;a& and his anti-corruption speech seduces&c;a& in a country largely affected by violence and poverty. Carlotta Morteo.\n\nJean&c;a& cap and leather jacket&c;a& impeccable beard&c;a& at 37&c;a& Nayib Bukele is the candidate for change. His credo: the fight against corruption. Its slogan: the end of impunity for elites who steal public money. The former mayor of San Salvador&c;a& who is of Palestinian origin and a professional publicist&c;a& enjoys a reputation as a good manager&c;a& and is known for securing and revitalizing the capital. In addition to his position neither left nor right&c;a& Nayib Bukele appealed to the youth and the urban middle class by his speeches on education&c;a& and his ideas to revive the economy: investment in industry&c;a& digital and agriculture by fiscal incentives and public subsidies&c;a& or tourism development&c;a& through the creation of a surf industry for example. All this&c;a& to stem the emigration of thousands of Salvadorans to the United States&c;a& and reduce the influence of criminal gangs. Gangs that have always had the means to influence the elections&c;a& and especially the participation rates. But given the huge gap in the polls between Nayib Bukele and his right-wing rival&c;a& millionaire Carlos Calleja&c;a& there is every chance that we will actually witness the end of bipartisanship in El Salvador.\n\nAD:  Electoral news again&c;a& but in Senegal with the beginning of the presidential campaign today.\n\nLB:  It will last three weeks&c;a& the first round is scheduled for February 24th. The outgoing Macky Sall&c;a& who is facing four other candidates&c;a& was holding a public meeting this Sunday in Touba. He hopes to be reelected in the first round as his predecessor Abdoulaye Wade in 2007.\n\nAD:  22h in Tel Aviv. Also in the news&c;a& this announcement of Benjamin Netanyahu to the attention of Iran.\n\nLB:  The Israeli prime minister warned this Sunday at the opening of the weekly cabinet meeting that his country will not hesitate to use force against Tehran&c;a& including during the election campaign. This threat comes the day after the test of a new cruise missile with a range greater than 1350 km&c;a& a test announced as a \"success\" by the Iranian regime. Listen to  Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"Today Iran celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and boasts of a new missile. Iran openly declares its intention to destroy the State of Israel. I have a clear message for the tyrants of Tehran: we know what you are doing and we know what you are about to do. We will continue to act against Iran with all the means at our disposal&c;a& so as to ensure the security of Israel and its future. \"\n\nAD:  In short&c;a& Theresa May reaffirms this Sunday her determination to execute Brexit on time.\n\nLB:  And with a revised divorce agreement with its European partners&c;a& this is what the British Prime Minister explains. While \"lingering uncertainty\" on this issue has pushed the Nissan car firm to give up an investment in England.\n\nAD:  In France&c;a& Emmanuel Macron in Paris suburbs on Monday. The Head of State will participate in a meeting in the context of the big debate.\n\nLB:  In Evry-Courcouronnes&c;a& precisely&c;a& this is the first time that the President carries the subject in the suburbs. Immediately you have an appointment with  Yvan Amar.\n\nA General of the Venezuelan Air Force has just sworn allegiance to Guaido. Not surprising information&c;a& but it revolves around this expression \"to make allegiance\". His meaning is very simple and very clear: General Yanez Rodriguez no longer recognizes the authority of Maduro and sided with Guaido. He changes his leader! He was under the authority of the President of the Republic. He places himself deliberately&c;a& that is to say on purpose&c;a& under that of the one who disputes him the power. He affirms his loyalty to the man who presents himself as the new head of state. The word&c;a& in French&c;a& comes from the Middle Ages and feudal practices&c;a& that is to say&c;a& which regulates the relations between the different lords. It is a hierarchy&c;a& that is to say an organization of powers&c;a& quite precise: each lord is under the authority of another&c;a& and that goes back to the king&c;a& who is only under the authority of God. He who has authority is the suzerain. He who obeys him is the vassal. And each noble is suzerain of him to whom he commands&c;a& and vassal of him to whom he obeys. And to make allegiance is to recognize someone&c;a& officially and solemnly&c;a& as his overlord. The expression can be used&c;a& as is the case here&c;a& if one changes sides: one shows it by designating the one one accepts as his superior. But we often hear the formula if someone has decided to have no leader at all&c;a& to be on his own&c;a& to admit no one's authority. And then things do not work as expected. The rebel does not escape&c;a& and he decides to return to the rank and again to obey a tutelage: he pledges allegiance to the one who represents this authority. -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nservane.briot@gmail.com to Lebanon! 2019-01-20 00:24:46 servane.briot@gmail.com to Lebanon! -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nFernando Pessoa - portugaise writer 2019-01-19 23:30:37 Fernando Pessoa - portugaise writer\n\nkhalil Gibran similar\n\nDied at 40\n\nNovalis - writer&c;a& German - romanticism\n\nMovie called borders she smells fear and guilt\n\ntessa.de.baudiniere@gmail.com\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nCheck this out later 2018-12-30 00:38:19 Check this out later\n\n￼\n\n/Users/bilalghalib/Downloads/all Audio/AnyTrans-Export-2023-07-25/Notes/Notes/Attachments/AcBC5rFUBL6FVAzpn1DDDaZFtp6p\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nNarjeel wood did mwabah 2018-12-23 14:12:28 Narjeel wood did mwabah\n\nKhidhr wood Misbaha\n\nPlan responses to failures :)\n\nHasibah\n\nPunka\n\nSarsari\n\nTsay hay\n\nBaltaji\n\nYataawlef\n\nHeetchi?

A term that seemed to me then excluding for the girl little feminine and flirt that I was.\n\nFirst&c;a& my personal quest for truth forced me to exclude the wearing of a mask. But how to determine what is a personal choice of what is social convention? The border was thin&c;a& and the reasons for my refusal of makeup more numerous.\n\nThe societal consensus around a feminine ideal is&c;a& of course&c;a& binding for women in the first place&c;a& but also for men&c;a& who unconsciously integrate this model of beauty - which I do not wish to perpetuate.\n\nIn a second time&c;a& I questioned the usefulness of make-up in a context of personal confidence. If such a small detail can contribute to the improvement of personal well-being&c;a& is not it worth it to pay attention to it?\n\nAfter a few months of use&c;a& I developed a psychological dependence on this seemingly precarious apparatus. This thin layer of pigments alone had inhibited my ability to accept some of my appearance - my skin&c;a& my face! - and developed in parallel an addiction to - not a feeling of well-being - but the absence of malaise.\n\nBecause wearing this makeup that hides a few buttons and highlights my blue eyes&c;a& it was not a way to accentuate my confidence and my strengths&c;a& it was now a necessity to make them exist.\n\nConscious of this discomfort&c;a& I proceeded by step to detox me gently. My cure was to remove one ingredient at a time&c;a& then choose a \"no\" day&c;a& until you reach a majority of \"no\" days a week.\n\nOf course the days of greatest importance were those where I exposed myself to the greatest number of social interactions&c;a& and those days represented huge steps to be taken for my personal self-esteem.\n\nBecause if my confidence in me is far from being reduced to my mere appearance&c;a& the environment in which I evolve does not deprive myself of judging me on this criterion \"at first sight\".\n\nToday&c;a& -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\n1205 West sherwin 2018-02-01 05:04:47 205 West sherwin\n\n60626\n\n3pm\n\nEagle hart\n\n802 buzzer\n\nBryant\n\nIski\n\n2852 7478\n\nMonday at noisebridge\n\nFriday at Sean breakfast\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nLinkx 2017-12-30 01:33:37 Linkx\n\nLinz\n\nhttps://twitter.com/daytradernik/status/946665180968210432\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tehmoonwalker/status/946875919691546624\n\nMsp\n\nNebl\n\nhttps://twitter.com/\\_tm3k/status/946877413249638400\n\nBytecoin\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cryptogat/status/946835652469026816\n\nFrom bags move over bought into oversold strategy\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nThe rainforest book.com 2017-11-14 08:10:56 The rainforest book.com\n\nBuilding startup communities\n\nBrian fled\n\nActed Iraq\n\nJeankarinthi@gmail.com\n\nChristian.bockarie@paris.fr\n\nEmbrace of the serpent\n\n#HappyHalloween from @qrs and the @fbi paranormal investigations unit 👻🌈💕 #WeGotThis instagram.com/p/Ba4TkVHHr8-/\n\nارسل رسالة فارغة على الرقم 1121 للتبرع ب1$ لمسنين بيت رفقا.بدعمكم منكمل المشوار.\n\nHello&c;a& I'd like to wear this scent behind my ears.

I understand hearing several things at different times was a lot to handle&c;a& and scary. It made you wonder how much more there was to reveal&c;a& if it would ever end.\n\nI can't change the past&c;a& my mistakes&c;a& nor how I shared&c;a& when and how much. I can assure you that the shift was real though.\n\nThe night I broke down and felt like I was dying&c;a& dreaming of you handing me a razor blade was absolutely terrifying. I can't prove to you the fact that it changed me profoundly. I can simply say it. It broke me open for the best&c;a& as in: being really and completely honest&c;a& facing my darkness&c;a& choosing what to do with that&c;a& and setting my intentions for the rest of my life.\n\nEventually I chose to forgive myself and understand what led me to do such disgusting things. All our discussions helped me a lot to draw and understand a clear picture of the large context in which these mistakes took place.\n\nI know you're never done growing&c;a& learning and refining. I also know this time was a stepping stone.\n\nPart of me is proud of where I stand today&c;a& for not killing nor hating myself&c;a& but being able to forgive and love better.\n\nAll of me is deeply sad and disappointed for hurting you so badly.\n\nDespite all this&c;a& I chose with my whole heart to want to be in a relationship with you&c;a& this time knowing much more precisely what I can/cannot handle&c;a& what I need&c;a& and what I want to build together.\n\nDespite time being rather short between the revelation and the proposal&c;a& I thought this was a good way to get a feel for how you want to move forward. I felt comfortable with asking - I actually felt at peace and inspired.\n\nI know for a fact that being chosen wholeheartedly is crucial to me. I know I will lose interest in our relationship by being tolerated rather than loved and cared for.\n\nIn the very beginning&c;a& the new me would have left or spoke up. I am choosing to accept the last five years for what they are: unsuccessful attempts at loving.\n\nWhen you create something&c;a& you go through iterations&c;a& you throw away the first attempts (or keep it on the shelf because you actually care about seeing the work in progress!) and eventually come closer to the ideal you have.\n\nI think our ideals were not aligned. Are they today?\n\nCan we craft together with the same/a similar definition of what beauty and love are?\n\nFirst and foremost: how engaged are we today?\n\n——————————————————————-\n\nIt’s not just how/when you unfolded things&c;a& I am surprised that you knew how hurt I was from the time with Chris\n\nHow hard it hit me\n\nI don’t think anything besides my nervous breakdown last summer about the hundreds of thousands of dead people in Iraq has ever hit me that hard. Kind of selfish I guess\n\nAnyway&c;a& it hurts.\n\nAnd what sometimes comes into my mind is - she saw me like that&c;a& and did things //again// after that. Many times. I know you were different then&c;a& and the first time (that you told me) probably was some sort of special situation. And knowing that and knowing that it happened again within a year&c;a& just does not compute for me.\n\nI understand your transformation probably feels real to you. I also know that change is hard. And people don’t really change a whole lot&c;a& not after a certain age. It’s possible&c;a& lots of people have transformations when they convert or leave their homes&c;a& and I see myself at least when I watch myself&c;a& I’m a goofy creative person and I fall back to that always.\n\nIt’s interesting&c;a& you’re giving me what you want most&c;a& to be in a relationship with me. In terms of revelations and moving forward&c;a& I wanted to be engaged and live together (closer) for a year before getting married because I knew my feelings take about a year after each previous revelation to come to some sort of steady state. I guess we’re halfway through this time&c;a& although it’s not getting calmer&c;a& I’m feeling more and more upset. I’m feeling betrayed in a way that something I desperately wanted&c;a& to feel deeply in love and to be able to articulate it honestly&c;a& each time is taken away from me&c;a& and it makes me feel quite angry&c;a& surprised&c;a& and helpless. It’s what I want too&c;a& to be honestly able to say loving things&c;a& and love you&c;a& and hold you and be happy and it takes me a long time to let go of fear (first time) let go of disgust (second time) and now my anger and disgust and fear is feeling less hot and doesn’t shake me. It just feels pointless. In my mind I can hear things like&c;a& she can do whatever she wants&c;a& I don’t care. I am feeling apathetic&c;a& rather than hurt&c;a& unless I thin about it or talk about it then I’m surprised and angry again&c;a& more surprised by the fact that I haven’t left and angry that my rare moments of honest expression of love were stolen from me.\n\nThis is what’s happening now for me and I said yes to the proposal because I wanted to move forward and ease in after the second series of revelations that happened in Beirut. And then the third the day before felt like a trap&c;a& because there was no turning back.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to bode well for our marriage. What a start&c;a& huh?\n\nI wonder what it would be like&c;a& or if it’s possible to break the rock crusted anger and surprise and resentment I feel and get to the core of the living parts again. At least when the lava was flowing I could see I also cared. Now I just want to cry at my loss. I’m not closing the door to forgiving you and not feeling upset towards you&c;a& it is a bit mixed up when you want me to do things to help you feel safer in life and in the relationship and I feel trapped in this position&c;a& and one day I can feeling no hard feelings between us. Is it possible for me to get to the point of loving again? Well&c;a& I know empathy is required&c;a& and each time I was so sorry for how things were going and the hurt you must have felt and I remember being able to understand and temper my hurt by understanding you. As hurt as I was I also cared. I’m not sure why that empathy is so much harder to feel. Maybe because the last revelation was earlier? Before I had a chance to hurt you so it was random? Perhaps because they kept coming&c;a& and the last one was sort of like a trap. Perhaps because now it just doesn’t even seem comparable anymore and I gave you enough excuses. I don’t know I’m trying to understand right now while writing…. I’m not attempting to be mean&c;a& and I don’t mean to come off as hopeless&c;a& I’m just opening up my mind to see what I don’t let myself sometimes even say to myself so perhaps we can find a way forward.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n1KaXDvNY4X4MEyftz2xmq76UdZUseHiE68\n\nI think I had no idea that I wanted to be chosen (openly so&c;a& clearly) and that my partner wouldn't have romantic/deep/time consuming relationships with other women.\n\nAlso didn't think it was that important for my partner to commit clearly&c;a& to know what he wants&c;a& and to act on it with no hesitation.\n\nI knew a feeling of settling was and is important to me&c;a& and that was lacking from the start in all aspects of our relationship. I was aware of that&c;a& and I didn't know if/when you'd want to be more settled. Hence: the marriage proposal as an opportunity to really find out.\n\nWhat made you say \"you're giving me what you want most: to be in a relationship with me\"?\n\nLet me correct something: What I want most (in terms of relationships) is to be with someone who dedicates him/herself to being loving and caring. To be there no matter what.\n\nThis is what I am trying to give you&c;a& and it doesn't feel like you want it - makes sense&c;a& today.\n\nI think I could have set my Sway profile as \"only looking for long term exclusive relationships\"&c;a& had I known that's what I wanted. As you say: I am surprised I didn't leave. I care about you too&c;a& but that's not what made me stay: I can recognize now I was simply too scared to leave. I had found something exciting and meaningful&c;a& even if it was painful. The thrill was worth it apparently.\n\nDo you really think I wanted to be a mean person? I know you are not&c;a& I think no one really wants to be mean&c;a& except rare occasions maybe&c;a& but that's not us. I hurt you because I was hurt&c;a& with no intention to hurt you. The only time I hurt you intentionally was in Berlin&c;a& after spending time with Lisa and we were in that hotel room at night. I felt so disrespected and hurt I remember hitting your leg. I was very angry&c;a& and immediately regretted.\n\nI am not evil. I care for you&c;a& and I am damn clumsy. I have a hard time being articulate and understanding my needs and emotions. And I am also brave and willing to make things nice no matter what it takes&c;a& as long as there is respect. Maybe we're simply too different&c;a& incompatible in terms of what we need and have to offer. Maybe timing was off all along.\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nPromotes respect for human rights 2019-06-12 19:23:17 5Promotes respect for human rights\n\n3.5 trillion dollars in management -\n\nInvestor responsibility to uphold human rights\n\nSupport investors in engaging companies on human rights and due diligence\n\nWork with investors to activate their leverage to bring\n\n2018 - ICT - investor engagement on human rights\n\nAlliance to work with civil society - identify salient risks / impact on people - engage companies/inside/outside strategies\n\nSycamore asset management\n\nGNI SVP caliber investment\n\nInstitutional investors invest other people’s money in different asset classes\n\nInvestors have a responsibility inline\n\nOECD guidlines\n\nWhat it looks like for investors to be responsible business actors.\n\nInvestors need to consider human rights criteria throughout the investment lifecycle\n\nInvest/ornot and then engage the company - identify risks on salient\n\nInvestors can file shareholder resolutions\n\nAsking for human rights impact\n\nPromote public policies\n\nAsset managers\n\nFaith based institutions\n\nTarget the investors that are not acting responsibly\n\nRobeko middle sized asset manager in nederlands\n\n3-4-5k companies worldwide - part of the active ownership team\n\nEnvironmental social govornance - tracking - 14 people work on these issues.

It is Aurélien Devernois who presents with me this edition. Good evening Aurélien.\n\nAurélien Devernois:  Good evening.\n\nLB:  In the headlines tonight: Venezuela and the ultimatum of European countries coming to an end. 7 countries&c;a& including France&c;a& had given Nicolas Maduro this evening to call for a new presidential election.\n\nAD:  In El Salvador&c;a& the presidential election is precisely this Sunday. 5 million voters go to the polls. For the first time&c;a& he is a centrist who is a favorite of polls.\n\nLB:  And then we'll come back to this announcement from Benyamin Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister says he is ready to use force against Iran&c;a& which has just announced the test of a long-range missile.\n\n\\-----\n\nAD:  First of all&c;a& Venezuela&c;a& where President Nicolas Maduro has once again proposed legislative elections. While several countries of the European Union are asking for a presidential election.\n\nLB:  This is Germany&c;a& Spain&c;a& France&c;a& Netherlands&c;a& Portugal&c;a& United Kingdom and Austria. In contrast&c;a& Russia&c;a& China&c;a& North Korea&c;a& Turkey or Cuba support Nicolas Maduro who rejects the ultimatum of European countries that had given him until tonight to organize the election otherwise they recognize self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido. Moreover&c;a& this crisis in Venezuela has significantly reduced the return to the country of the currencies. This weekend&c;a& the company Noor Capital&c;a& based in Abu Dhabi&c;a& has finally confirmed having conducted a gold exchange for foreign exchange on behalf of the Republic of Venezuela. An operation carried out in the legality and in the respect of the international law according to this company&c;a& but which raises many criticisms from the part opposed to the power in place. The explanations of  Romain Lemaresquier.\n\nIt is the American senator Marco Rubio&c;a& a great critic of the regime of Nicolas Maduro&c;a& who had revealed the affair on social networks. And after a long silence: Noor Capital has finally confirmed having purchased 3 tons of gold reserves of the Venezuelan central bank&c;a& in exchange for foreign currency. An operation much criticized by the slayers of the Chavista regime who accuse Noor Capital of allowing the survival of a financially depressed regime. After recognizing this transaction&c;a& Noor Capital announced that it would no longer conduct any such transactions with the Venezuelan State until the situation stabilized. An announcement that puts an end to two other operations that were to be conducted soon according to Reuters. A total of 29 tons of gold were to be sold. 15 tons were expected to be shipped to the United Arab Emirates soon&c;a& while another 11 tons were to be sold in mid-February. Operations scrutinized especially by the United States who warned the banking institutions not to do business with Venezuelan gold. The flight of capital is one of the recurring themes in this Venezuelan crisis. And even within the Venezuelan central bank a resistance seems to be put in place. Some employees refuse that Venezuelan assets be squandered. Moreover&c;a& two of them were fired last week because they refused to let the gold out of the banking institution.\n\nLB:  I would add that Donald Trump reiterated that recourse to the US military in Venezuela was \"an option\" considered in the face of the political crisis that is shaking the country.\n\nAD:  In El Salvador&c;a& some 5 million voters have gone to the polls to elect their next president.\n\nLB:  Since the end of the civil war in 1992&c;a& two parties share the power: the ARENA&c;a& right&c;a& the ARENA&c;a& and the left party the FMLN&c;a& but today it is a candidate who is positioned rather in the center which is widely favored polls. His name is Nayib Bukélé&c;a& the GANA coalition candidate. He has campaigned on social networks&c;a& and his anti-corruption speech seduces&c;a& in a country largely affected by violence and poverty. Carlotta Morteo.\n\nJean&c;a& cap and leather jacket&c;a& impeccable beard&c;a& at 37&c;a& Nayib Bukele is the candidate for change. His credo: the fight against corruption. Its slogan: the end of impunity for elites who steal public money. The former mayor of San Salvador&c;a& who is of Palestinian origin and a professional publicist&c;a& enjoys a reputation as a good manager&c;a& and is known for securing and revitalizing the capital. In addition to his position neither left nor right&c;a& Nayib Bukele appealed to the youth and the urban middle class by his speeches on education&c;a& and his ideas to revive the economy: investment in industry&c;a& digital and agriculture by fiscal incentives and public subsidies&c;a& or tourism development&c;a& through the creation of a surf industry for example. All this&c;a& to stem the emigration of thousands of Salvadorans to the United States&c;a& and reduce the influence of criminal gangs. Gangs that have always had the means to influence the elections&c;a& and especially the participation rates. But given the huge gap in the polls between Nayib Bukele and his right-wing rival&c;a& millionaire Carlos Calleja&c;a& there is every chance that we will actually witness the end of bipartisanship in El Salvador.\n\nAD:  Electoral news again&c;a& but in Senegal with the beginning of the presidential campaign today.\n\nLB:  It will last three weeks&c;a& the first round is scheduled for February 24th. The outgoing Macky Sall&c;a& who is facing four other candidates&c;a& was holding a public meeting this Sunday in Touba. He hopes to be reelected in the first round as his predecessor Abdoulaye Wade in 2007.\n\nAD:  22h in Tel Aviv. Also in the news&c;a& this announcement of Benjamin Netanyahu to the attention of Iran.\n\nLB:  The Israeli prime minister warned this Sunday at the opening of the weekly cabinet meeting that his country will not hesitate to use force against Tehran&c;a& including during the election campaign. This threat comes the day after the test of a new cruise missile with a range greater than 1350 km&c;a& a test announced as a \"success\" by the Iranian regime. Listen to  Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"Today Iran celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and boasts of a new missile. Iran openly declares its intention to destroy the State of Israel. I have a clear message for the tyrants of Tehran: we know what you are doing and we know what you are about to do. We will continue to act against Iran with all the means at our disposal&c;a& so as to ensure the security of Israel and its future. \"\n\nAD:  In short&c;a& Theresa May reaffirms this Sunday her determination to execute Brexit on time.\n\nLB:  And with a revised divorce agreement with its European partners&c;a& this is what the British Prime Minister explains. While \"lingering uncertainty\" on this issue has pushed the Nissan car firm to give up an investment in England.\n\nAD:  In France&c;a& Emmanuel Macron in Paris suburbs on Monday. The Head of State will participate in a meeting in the context of the big debate.\n\nLB:  In Evry-Courcouronnes&c;a& precisely&c;a& this is the first time that the President carries the subject in the suburbs. Immediately you have an appointment with  Yvan Amar.\n\nA General of the Venezuelan Air Force has just sworn allegiance to Guaido. Not surprising information&c;a& but it revolves around this expression \"to make allegiance\". His meaning is very simple and very clear: General Yanez Rodriguez no longer recognizes the authority of Maduro and sided with Guaido. He changes his leader! He was under the authority of the President of the Republic. He places himself deliberately&c;a& that is to say on purpose&c;a& under that of the one who disputes him the power. He affirms his loyalty to the man who presents himself as the new head of state. The word&c;a& in French&c;a& comes from the Middle Ages and feudal practices&c;a& that is to say&c;a& which regulates the relations between the different lords. It is a hierarchy&c;a& that is to say an organization of powers&c;a& quite precise: each lord is under the authority of another&c;a& and that goes back to the king&c;a& who is only under the authority of God. He who has authority is the suzerain. He who obeys him is the vassal. And each noble is suzerain of him to whom he commands&c;a& and vassal of him to whom he obeys. And to make allegiance is to recognize someone&c;a& officially and solemnly&c;a& as his overlord. The expression can be used&c;a& as is the case here&c;a& if one changes sides: one shows it by designating the one one accepts as his superior. But we often hear the formula if someone has decided to have no leader at all&c;a& to be on his own&c;a& to admit no one's authority. And then things do not work as expected. The rebel does not escape&c;a& and he decides to return to the rank and again to obey a tutelage: he pledges allegiance to the one who represents this authority. -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nservane.briot@gmail.com to Lebanon! 2019-01-20 00:24:46 servane.briot@gmail.com to Lebanon! -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nFernando Pessoa - portugaise writer 2019-01-19 23:30:37 Fernando Pessoa - portugaise writer\n\nkhalil Gibran similar\n\nDied at 40\n\nNovalis - writer&c;a& German - romanticism\n\nMovie called borders she smells fear and guilt\n\ntessa.de.baudiniere@gmail.com\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nCheck this out later 2018-12-30 00:38:19 Check this out later\n\n￼\n\n/Users/bilalghalib/Downloads/all Audio/AnyTrans-Export-2023-07-25/Notes/Notes/Attachments/AcBC5rFUBL6FVAzpn1DDDaZFtp6p\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nNarjeel wood did mwabah 2018-12-23 14:12:28 Narjeel wood did mwabah\n\nKhidhr wood Misbaha\n\nPlan responses to failures :)\n\nHasibah\n\nPunka\n\nSarsari\n\nTsay hay\n\nBaltaji\n\nYataawlef\n\nHeetchi?

A term that seemed to me then excluding for the girl little feminine and flirt that I was.\n\nFirst&c;a& my personal quest for truth forced me to exclude the wearing of a mask. But how to determine what is a personal choice of what is social convention? The border was thin&c;a& and the reasons for my refusal of makeup more numerous.\n\nThe societal consensus around a feminine ideal is&c;a& of course&c;a& binding for women in the first place&c;a& but also for men&c;a& who unconsciously integrate this model of beauty - which I do not wish to perpetuate.\n\nIn a second time&c;a& I questioned the usefulness of make-up in a context of personal confidence. If such a small detail can contribute to the improvement of personal well-being&c;a& is not it worth it to pay attention to it?\n\nAfter a few months of use&c;a& I developed a psychological dependence on this seemingly precarious apparatus. This thin layer of pigments alone had inhibited my ability to accept some of my appearance - my skin&c;a& my face! - and developed in parallel an addiction to - not a feeling of well-being - but the absence of malaise.\n\nBecause wearing this makeup that hides a few buttons and highlights my blue eyes&c;a& it was not a way to accentuate my confidence and my strengths&c;a& it was now a necessity to make them exist.\n\nConscious of this discomfort&c;a& I proceeded by step to detox me gently. My cure was to remove one ingredient at a time&c;a& then choose a \"no\" day&c;a& until you reach a majority of \"no\" days a week.\n\nOf course the days of greatest importance were those where I exposed myself to the greatest number of social interactions&c;a& and those days represented huge steps to be taken for my personal self-esteem.\n\nBecause if my confidence in me is far from being reduced to my mere appearance&c;a& the environment in which I evolve does not deprive myself of judging me on this criterion \"at first sight\".\n\nToday&c;a& -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\n1205 West sherwin 2018-02-01 05:04:47 205 West sherwin\n\n60626\n\n3pm\n\nEagle hart\n\n802 buzzer\n\nBryant\n\nIski\n\n2852 7478\n\nMonday at noisebridge\n\nFriday at Sean breakfast\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nLinkx 2017-12-30 01:33:37 Linkx\n\nLinz\n\nhttps://twitter.com/daytradernik/status/946665180968210432\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tehmoonwalker/status/946875919691546624\n\nMsp\n\nNebl\n\nhttps://twitter.com/\\_tm3k/status/946877413249638400\n\nBytecoin\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cryptogat/status/946835652469026816\n\nFrom bags move over bought into oversold strategy\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nThe rainforest book.com 2017-11-14 08:10:56 The rainforest book.com\n\nBuilding startup communities\n\nBrian fled\n\nActed Iraq\n\nJeankarinthi@gmail.com\n\nChristian.bockarie@paris.fr\n\nEmbrace of the serpent\n\n#HappyHalloween from @qrs and the @fbi paranormal investigations unit 👻🌈💕 #WeGotThis instagram.com/p/Ba4TkVHHr8-/\n\nارسل رسالة فارغة على الرقم 1121 للتبرع ب1$ لمسنين بيت رفقا.بدعمكم منكمل المشوار.\n\nHello&c;a& I'd like to wear this scent behind my ears.

I understand hearing several things at different times was a lot to handle&c;a& and scary. It made you wonder how much more there was to reveal&c;a& if it would ever end.\n\nI can't change the past&c;a& my mistakes&c;a& nor how I shared&c;a& when and how much. I can assure you that the shift was real though.\n\nThe night I broke down and felt like I was dying&c;a& dreaming of you handing me a razor blade was absolutely terrifying. I can't prove to you the fact that it changed me profoundly. I can simply say it. It broke me open for the best&c;a& as in: being really and completely honest&c;a& facing my darkness&c;a& choosing what to do with that&c;a& and setting my intentions for the rest of my life.\n\nEventually I chose to forgive myself and understand what led me to do such disgusting things. All our discussions helped me a lot to draw and understand a clear picture of the large context in which these mistakes took place.\n\nI know you're never done growing&c;a& learning and refining. I also know this time was a stepping stone.\n\nPart of me is proud of where I stand today&c;a& for not killing nor hating myself&c;a& but being able to forgive and love better.\n\nAll of me is deeply sad and disappointed for hurting you so badly.\n\nDespite all this&c;a& I chose with my whole heart to want to be in a relationship with you&c;a& this time knowing much more precisely what I can/cannot handle&c;a& what I need&c;a& and what I want to build together.\n\nDespite time being rather short between the revelation and the proposal&c;a& I thought this was a good way to get a feel for how you want to move forward. I felt comfortable with asking - I actually felt at peace and inspired.\n\nI know for a fact that being chosen wholeheartedly is crucial to me. I know I will lose interest in our relationship by being tolerated rather than loved and cared for.\n\nIn the very beginning&c;a& the new me would have left or spoke up. I am choosing to accept the last five years for what they are: unsuccessful attempts at loving.\n\nWhen you create something&c;a& you go through iterations&c;a& you throw away the first attempts (or keep it on the shelf because you actually care about seeing the work in progress!) and eventually come closer to the ideal you have.\n\nI think our ideals were not aligned. Are they today?\n\nCan we craft together with the same/a similar definition of what beauty and love are?\n\nFirst and foremost: how engaged are we today?\n\n——————————————————————-\n\nIt’s not just how/when you unfolded things&c;a& I am surprised that you knew how hurt I was from the time with Chris\n\nHow hard it hit me\n\nI don’t think anything besides my nervous breakdown last summer about the hundreds of thousands of dead people in Iraq has ever hit me that hard. Kind of selfish I guess\n\nAnyway&c;a& it hurts.\n\nAnd what sometimes comes into my mind is - she saw me like that&c;a& and did things //again// after that. Many times. I know you were different then&c;a& and the first time (that you told me) probably was some sort of special situation. And knowing that and knowing that it happened again within a year&c;a& just does not compute for me.\n\nI understand your transformation probably feels real to you. I also know that change is hard. And people don’t really change a whole lot&c;a& not after a certain age. It’s possible&c;a& lots of people have transformations when they convert or leave their homes&c;a& and I see myself at least when I watch myself&c;a& I’m a goofy creative person and I fall back to that always.\n\nIt’s interesting&c;a& you’re giving me what you want most&c;a& to be in a relationship with me. In terms of revelations and moving forward&c;a& I wanted to be engaged and live together (closer) for a year before getting married because I knew my feelings take about a year after each previous revelation to come to some sort of steady state. I guess we’re halfway through this time&c;a& although it’s not getting calmer&c;a& I’m feeling more and more upset. I’m feeling betrayed in a way that something I desperately wanted&c;a& to feel deeply in love and to be able to articulate it honestly&c;a& each time is taken away from me&c;a& and it makes me feel quite angry&c;a& surprised&c;a& and helpless. It’s what I want too&c;a& to be honestly able to say loving things&c;a& and love you&c;a& and hold you and be happy and it takes me a long time to let go of fear (first time) let go of disgust (second time) and now my anger and disgust and fear is feeling less hot and doesn’t shake me. It just feels pointless. In my mind I can hear things like&c;a& she can do whatever she wants&c;a& I don’t care. I am feeling apathetic&c;a& rather than hurt&c;a& unless I thin about it or talk about it then I’m surprised and angry again&c;a& more surprised by the fact that I haven’t left and angry that my rare moments of honest expression of love were stolen from me.\n\nThis is what’s happening now for me and I said yes to the proposal because I wanted to move forward and ease in after the second series of revelations that happened in Beirut. And then the third the day before felt like a trap&c;a& because there was no turning back.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to bode well for our marriage. What a start&c;a& huh?\n\nI wonder what it would be like&c;a& or if it’s possible to break the rock crusted anger and surprise and resentment I feel and get to the core of the living parts again. At least when the lava was flowing I could see I also cared. Now I just want to cry at my loss. I’m not closing the door to forgiving you and not feeling upset towards you&c;a& it is a bit mixed up when you want me to do things to help you feel safer in life and in the relationship and I feel trapped in this position&c;a& and one day I can feeling no hard feelings between us. Is it possible for me to get to the point of loving again? Well&c;a& I know empathy is required&c;a& and each time I was so sorry for how things were going and the hurt you must have felt and I remember being able to understand and temper my hurt by understanding you. As hurt as I was I also cared. I’m not sure why that empathy is so much harder to feel. Maybe because the last revelation was earlier? Before I had a chance to hurt you so it was random? Perhaps because they kept coming&c;a& and the last one was sort of like a trap. Perhaps because now it just doesn’t even seem comparable anymore and I gave you enough excuses. I don’t know I’m trying to understand right now while writing…. I’m not attempting to be mean&c;a& and I don’t mean to come off as hopeless&c;a& I’m just opening up my mind to see what I don’t let myself sometimes even say to myself so perhaps we can find a way forward.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n1KaXDvNY4X4MEyftz2xmq76UdZUseHiE68\n\nI think I had no idea that I wanted to be chosen (openly so&c;a& clearly) and that my partner wouldn't have romantic/deep/time consuming relationships with other women.\n\nAlso didn't think it was that important for my partner to commit clearly&c;a& to know what he wants&c;a& and to act on it with no hesitation.\n\nI knew a feeling of settling was and is important to me&c;a& and that was lacking from the start in all aspects of our relationship. I was aware of that&c;a& and I didn't know if/when you'd want to be more settled. Hence: the marriage proposal as an opportunity to really find out.\n\nWhat made you say \"you're giving me what you want most: to be in a relationship with me\"?\n\nLet me correct something: What I want most (in terms of relationships) is to be with someone who dedicates him/herself to being loving and caring. To be there no matter what.\n\nThis is what I am trying to give you&c;a& and it doesn't feel like you want it - makes sense&c;a& today.\n\nI think I could have set my Sway profile as \"only looking for long term exclusive relationships\"&c;a& had I known that's what I wanted. As you say: I am surprised I didn't leave. I care about you too&c;a& but that's not what made me stay: I can recognize now I was simply too scared to leave. I had found something exciting and meaningful&c;a& even if it was painful. The thrill was worth it apparently.\n\nDo you really think I wanted to be a mean person? I know you are not&c;a& I think no one really wants to be mean&c;a& except rare occasions maybe&c;a& but that's not us. I hurt you because I was hurt&c;a& with no intention to hurt you. The only time I hurt you intentionally was in Berlin&c;a& after spending time with Lisa and we were in that hotel room at night. I felt so disrespected and hurt I remember hitting your leg. I was very angry&c;a& and immediately regretted.\n\nI am not evil. I care for you&c;a& and I am damn clumsy. I have a hard time being articulate and understanding my needs and emotions. And I am also brave and willing to make things nice no matter what it takes&c;a& as long as there is respect. Maybe we're simply too different&c;a& incompatible in terms of what we need and have to offer. Maybe timing was off all along.\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nPromotes respect for human rights 2019-06-12 19:23:17 5Promotes respect for human rights\n\n3.5 trillion dollars in management -\n\nInvestor responsibility to uphold human rights\n\nSupport investors in engaging companies on human rights and due diligence\n\nWork with investors to activate their leverage to bring\n\n2018 - ICT - investor engagement on human rights\n\nAlliance to work with civil society - identify salient risks / impact on people - engage companies/inside/outside strategies\n\nSycamore asset management\n\nGNI SVP caliber investment\n\nInstitutional investors invest other people’s money in different asset classes\n\nInvestors have a responsibility inline\n\nOECD guidlines\n\nWhat it looks like for investors to be responsible business actors.\n\nInvestors need to consider human rights criteria throughout the investment lifecycle\n\nInvest/ornot and then engage the company - identify risks on salient\n\nInvestors can file shareholder resolutions\n\nAsking for human rights impact\n\nPromote public policies\n\nAsset managers\n\nFaith based institutions\n\nTarget the investors that are not acting responsibly\n\nRobeko middle sized asset manager in nederlands\n\n3-4-5k companies worldwide - part of the active ownership team\n\nEnvironmental social govornance - tracking - 14 people work on these issues.

It is Aurélien Devernois who presents with me this edition. Good evening Aurélien.\n\nAurélien Devernois:  Good evening.\n\nLB:  In the headlines tonight: Venezuela and the ultimatum of European countries coming to an end. 7 countries&c;a& including France&c;a& had given Nicolas Maduro this evening to call for a new presidential election.\n\nAD:  In El Salvador&c;a& the presidential election is precisely this Sunday. 5 million voters go to the polls. For the first time&c;a& he is a centrist who is a favorite of polls.\n\nLB:  And then we'll come back to this announcement from Benyamin Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister says he is ready to use force against Iran&c;a& which has just announced the test of a long-range missile.\n\n\\-----\n\nAD:  First of all&c;a& Venezuela&c;a& where President Nicolas Maduro has once again proposed legislative elections. While several countries of the European Union are asking for a presidential election.\n\nLB:  This is Germany&c;a& Spain&c;a& France&c;a& Netherlands&c;a& Portugal&c;a& United Kingdom and Austria. In contrast&c;a& Russia&c;a& China&c;a& North Korea&c;a& Turkey or Cuba support Nicolas Maduro who rejects the ultimatum of European countries that had given him until tonight to organize the election otherwise they recognize self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido. Moreover&c;a& this crisis in Venezuela has significantly reduced the return to the country of the currencies. This weekend&c;a& the company Noor Capital&c;a& based in Abu Dhabi&c;a& has finally confirmed having conducted a gold exchange for foreign exchange on behalf of the Republic of Venezuela. An operation carried out in the legality and in the respect of the international law according to this company&c;a& but which raises many criticisms from the part opposed to the power in place. The explanations of  Romain Lemaresquier.\n\nIt is the American senator Marco Rubio&c;a& a great critic of the regime of Nicolas Maduro&c;a& who had revealed the affair on social networks. And after a long silence: Noor Capital has finally confirmed having purchased 3 tons of gold reserves of the Venezuelan central bank&c;a& in exchange for foreign currency. An operation much criticized by the slayers of the Chavista regime who accuse Noor Capital of allowing the survival of a financially depressed regime. After recognizing this transaction&c;a& Noor Capital announced that it would no longer conduct any such transactions with the Venezuelan State until the situation stabilized. An announcement that puts an end to two other operations that were to be conducted soon according to Reuters. A total of 29 tons of gold were to be sold. 15 tons were expected to be shipped to the United Arab Emirates soon&c;a& while another 11 tons were to be sold in mid-February. Operations scrutinized especially by the United States who warned the banking institutions not to do business with Venezuelan gold. The flight of capital is one of the recurring themes in this Venezuelan crisis. And even within the Venezuelan central bank a resistance seems to be put in place. Some employees refuse that Venezuelan assets be squandered. Moreover&c;a& two of them were fired last week because they refused to let the gold out of the banking institution.\n\nLB:  I would add that Donald Trump reiterated that recourse to the US military in Venezuela was \"an option\" considered in the face of the political crisis that is shaking the country.\n\nAD:  In El Salvador&c;a& some 5 million voters have gone to the polls to elect their next president.\n\nLB:  Since the end of the civil war in 1992&c;a& two parties share the power: the ARENA&c;a& right&c;a& the ARENA&c;a& and the left party the FMLN&c;a& but today it is a candidate who is positioned rather in the center which is widely favored polls. His name is Nayib Bukélé&c;a& the GANA coalition candidate. He has campaigned on social networks&c;a& and his anti-corruption speech seduces&c;a& in a country largely affected by violence and poverty. Carlotta Morteo.\n\nJean&c;a& cap and leather jacket&c;a& impeccable beard&c;a& at 37&c;a& Nayib Bukele is the candidate for change. His credo: the fight against corruption. Its slogan: the end of impunity for elites who steal public money. The former mayor of San Salvador&c;a& who is of Palestinian origin and a professional publicist&c;a& enjoys a reputation as a good manager&c;a& and is known for securing and revitalizing the capital. In addition to his position neither left nor right&c;a& Nayib Bukele appealed to the youth and the urban middle class by his speeches on education&c;a& and his ideas to revive the economy: investment in industry&c;a& digital and agriculture by fiscal incentives and public subsidies&c;a& or tourism development&c;a& through the creation of a surf industry for example. All this&c;a& to stem the emigration of thousands of Salvadorans to the United States&c;a& and reduce the influence of criminal gangs. Gangs that have always had the means to influence the elections&c;a& and especially the participation rates. But given the huge gap in the polls between Nayib Bukele and his right-wing rival&c;a& millionaire Carlos Calleja&c;a& there is every chance that we will actually witness the end of bipartisanship in El Salvador.\n\nAD:  Electoral news again&c;a& but in Senegal with the beginning of the presidential campaign today.\n\nLB:  It will last three weeks&c;a& the first round is scheduled for February 24th. The outgoing Macky Sall&c;a& who is facing four other candidates&c;a& was holding a public meeting this Sunday in Touba. He hopes to be reelected in the first round as his predecessor Abdoulaye Wade in 2007.\n\nAD:  22h in Tel Aviv. Also in the news&c;a& this announcement of Benjamin Netanyahu to the attention of Iran.\n\nLB:  The Israeli prime minister warned this Sunday at the opening of the weekly cabinet meeting that his country will not hesitate to use force against Tehran&c;a& including during the election campaign. This threat comes the day after the test of a new cruise missile with a range greater than 1350 km&c;a& a test announced as a \"success\" by the Iranian regime. Listen to  Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"Today Iran celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and boasts of a new missile. Iran openly declares its intention to destroy the State of Israel. I have a clear message for the tyrants of Tehran: we know what you are doing and we know what you are about to do. We will continue to act against Iran with all the means at our disposal&c;a& so as to ensure the security of Israel and its future. \"\n\nAD:  In short&c;a& Theresa May reaffirms this Sunday her determination to execute Brexit on time.\n\nLB:  And with a revised divorce agreement with its European partners&c;a& this is what the British Prime Minister explains. While \"lingering uncertainty\" on this issue has pushed the Nissan car firm to give up an investment in England.\n\nAD:  In France&c;a& Emmanuel Macron in Paris suburbs on Monday. The Head of State will participate in a meeting in the context of the big debate.\n\nLB:  In Evry-Courcouronnes&c;a& precisely&c;a& this is the first time that the President carries the subject in the suburbs. Immediately you have an appointment with  Yvan Amar.\n\nA General of the Venezuelan Air Force has just sworn allegiance to Guaido. Not surprising information&c;a& but it revolves around this expression \"to make allegiance\". His meaning is very simple and very clear: General Yanez Rodriguez no longer recognizes the authority of Maduro and sided with Guaido. He changes his leader! He was under the authority of the President of the Republic. He places himself deliberately&c;a& that is to say on purpose&c;a& under that of the one who disputes him the power. He affirms his loyalty to the man who presents himself as the new head of state. The word&c;a& in French&c;a& comes from the Middle Ages and feudal practices&c;a& that is to say&c;a& which regulates the relations between the different lords. It is a hierarchy&c;a& that is to say an organization of powers&c;a& quite precise: each lord is under the authority of another&c;a& and that goes back to the king&c;a& who is only under the authority of God. He who has authority is the suzerain. He who obeys him is the vassal. And each noble is suzerain of him to whom he commands&c;a& and vassal of him to whom he obeys. And to make allegiance is to recognize someone&c;a& officially and solemnly&c;a& as his overlord. The expression can be used&c;a& as is the case here&c;a& if one changes sides: one shows it by designating the one one accepts as his superior. But we often hear the formula if someone has decided to have no leader at all&c;a& to be on his own&c;a& to admit no one's authority. And then things do not work as expected. The rebel does not escape&c;a& and he decides to return to the rank and again to obey a tutelage: he pledges allegiance to the one who represents this authority. -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nservane.briot@gmail.com to Lebanon! 2019-01-20 00:24:46 servane.briot@gmail.com to Lebanon! -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nFernando Pessoa - portugaise writer 2019-01-19 23:30:37 Fernando Pessoa - portugaise writer\n\nkhalil Gibran similar\n\nDied at 40\n\nNovalis - writer&c;a& German - romanticism\n\nMovie called borders she smells fear and guilt\n\ntessa.de.baudiniere@gmail.com\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nCheck this out later 2018-12-30 00:38:19 Check this out later\n\n￼\n\n/Users/bilalghalib/Downloads/all Audio/AnyTrans-Export-2023-07-25/Notes/Notes/Attachments/AcBC5rFUBL6FVAzpn1DDDaZFtp6p\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nNarjeel wood did mwabah 2018-12-23 14:12:28 Narjeel wood did mwabah\n\nKhidhr wood Misbaha\n\nPlan responses to failures :)\n\nHasibah\n\nPunka\n\nSarsari\n\nTsay hay\n\nBaltaji\n\nYataawlef\n\nHeetchi?

The border was thin&c;a& and the reasons for my refusal of makeup more numerous.\n\nThe societal consensus around a feminine ideal is&c;a& of course&c;a& binding for women in the first place&c;a& but also for men&c;a& who unconsciously integrate this model of beauty - which I do not wish to perpetuate.\n\nIn a second time&c;a& I questioned the usefulness of make-up in a context of personal confidence. If such a small detail can contribute to the improvement of personal well-being&c;a& is not it worth it to pay attention to it?\n\nAfter a few months of use&c;a& I developed a psychological dependence on this seemingly precarious apparatus. This thin layer of pigments alone had inhibited my ability to accept some of my appearance - my skin&c;a& my face! - and developed in parallel an addiction to - not a feeling of well-being - but the absence of malaise.\n\nBecause wearing this makeup that hides a few buttons and highlights my blue eyes&c;a& it was not a way to accentuate my confidence and my strengths&c;a& it was now a necessity to make them exist.\n\nConscious of this discomfort&c;a& I proceeded by step to detox me gently. My cure was to remove one ingredient at a time&c;a& then choose a \"no\" day&c;a& until you reach a majority of \"no\" days a week.\n\nOf course the days of greatest importance were those where I exposed myself to the greatest number of social interactions&c;a& and those days represented huge steps to be taken for my personal self-esteem.\n\nBecause if my confidence in me is far from being reduced to my mere appearance&c;a& the environment in which I evolve does not deprive myself of judging me on this criterion \"at first sight\".\n\nToday&c;a& -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\n1205 West sherwin 2018-02-01 05:04:47 205 West sherwin\n\n60626\n\n3pm\n\nEagle hart\n\n802 buzzer\n\nBryant\n\nIski\n\n2852 7478\n\nMonday at noisebridge\n\nFriday at Sean breakfast\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nLinkx 2017-12-30 01:33:37 Linkx\n\nLinz\n\nhttps://twitter.com/daytradernik/status/946665180968210432\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tehmoonwalker/status/946875919691546624\n\nMsp\n\nNebl\n\nhttps://twitter.com/\\_tm3k/status/946877413249638400\n\nBytecoin\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cryptogat/status/946835652469026816\n\nFrom bags move over bought into oversold strategy\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nThe rainforest book.com 2017-11-14 08:10:56 The rainforest book.com\n\nBuilding startup communities\n\nBrian fled\n\nActed Iraq\n\nJeankarinthi@gmail.com\n\nChristian.bockarie@paris.fr\n\nEmbrace of the serpent\n\n#HappyHalloween from @qrs and the @fbi paranormal investigations unit 👻🌈💕 #WeGotThis instagram.com/p/Ba4TkVHHr8-/\n\nارسل رسالة فارغة على الرقم 1121 للتبرع ب1$ لمسنين بيت رفقا.بدعمكم منكمل المشوار.\n\nHello&c;a& I'd like to wear this scent behind my ears.

I understand hearing several things at different times was a lot to handle&c;a& and scary. It made you wonder how much more there was to reveal&c;a& if it would ever end.\n\nI can't change the past&c;a& my mistakes&c;a& nor how I shared&c;a& when and how much. I can assure you that the shift was real though.\n\nThe night I broke down and felt like I was dying&c;a& dreaming of you handing me a razor blade was absolutely terrifying. I can't prove to you the fact that it changed me profoundly. I can simply say it. It broke me open for the best&c;a& as in: being really and completely honest&c;a& facing my darkness&c;a& choosing what to do with that&c;a& and setting my intentions for the rest of my life.\n\nEventually I chose to forgive myself and understand what led me to do such disgusting things. All our discussions helped me a lot to draw and understand a clear picture of the large context in which these mistakes took place.\n\nI know you're never done growing&c;a& learning and refining. I also know this time was a stepping stone.\n\nPart of me is proud of where I stand today&c;a& for not killing nor hating myself&c;a& but being able to forgive and love better.\n\nAll of me is deeply sad and disappointed for hurting you so badly.\n\nDespite all this&c;a& I chose with my whole heart to want to be in a relationship with you&c;a& this time knowing much more precisely what I can/cannot handle&c;a& what I need&c;a& and what I want to build together.\n\nDespite time being rather short between the revelation and the proposal&c;a& I thought this was a good way to get a feel for how you want to move forward. I felt comfortable with asking - I actually felt at peace and inspired.\n\nI know for a fact that being chosen wholeheartedly is crucial to me. I know I will lose interest in our relationship by being tolerated rather than loved and cared for.\n\nIn the very beginning&c;a& the new me would have left or spoke up. I am choosing to accept the last five years for what they are: unsuccessful attempts at loving.\n\nWhen you create something&c;a& you go through iterations&c;a& you throw away the first attempts (or keep it on the shelf because you actually care about seeing the work in progress!) and eventually come closer to the ideal you have.\n\nI think our ideals were not aligned. Are they today?\n\nCan we craft together with the same/a similar definition of what beauty and love are?\n\nFirst and foremost: how engaged are we today?\n\n——————————————————————-\n\nIt’s not just how/when you unfolded things&c;a& I am surprised that you knew how hurt I was from the time with Chris\n\nHow hard it hit me\n\nI don’t think anything besides my nervous breakdown last summer about the hundreds of thousands of dead people in Iraq has ever hit me that hard. Kind of selfish I guess\n\nAnyway&c;a& it hurts.\n\nAnd what sometimes comes into my mind is - she saw me like that&c;a& and did things //again// after that. Many times. I know you were different then&c;a& and the first time (that you told me) probably was some sort of special situation. And knowing that and knowing that it happened again within a year&c;a& just does not compute for me.\n\nI understand your transformation probably feels real to you. I also know that change is hard. And people don’t really change a whole lot&c;a& not after a certain age. It’s possible&c;a& lots of people have transformations when they convert or leave their homes&c;a& and I see myself at least when I watch myself&c;a& I’m a goofy creative person and I fall back to that always.\n\nIt’s interesting&c;a& you’re giving me what you want most&c;a& to be in a relationship with me. In terms of revelations and moving forward&c;a& I wanted to be engaged and live together (closer) for a year before getting married because I knew my feelings take about a year after each previous revelation to come to some sort of steady state. I guess we’re halfway through this time&c;a& although it’s not getting calmer&c;a& I’m feeling more and more upset. I’m feeling betrayed in a way that something I desperately wanted&c;a& to feel deeply in love and to be able to articulate it honestly&c;a& each time is taken away from me&c;a& and it makes me feel quite angry&c;a& surprised&c;a& and helpless. It’s what I want too&c;a& to be honestly able to say loving things&c;a& and love you&c;a& and hold you and be happy and it takes me a long time to let go of fear (first time) let go of disgust (second time) and now my anger and disgust and fear is feeling less hot and doesn’t shake me. It just feels pointless. In my mind I can hear things like&c;a& she can do whatever she wants&c;a& I don’t care. I am feeling apathetic&c;a& rather than hurt&c;a& unless I thin about it or talk about it then I’m surprised and angry again&c;a& more surprised by the fact that I haven’t left and angry that my rare moments of honest expression of love were stolen from me.\n\nThis is what’s happening now for me and I said yes to the proposal because I wanted to move forward and ease in after the second series of revelations that happened in Beirut. And then the third the day before felt like a trap&c;a& because there was no turning back.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to bode well for our marriage. What a start&c;a& huh?\n\nI wonder what it would be like&c;a& or if it’s possible to break the rock crusted anger and surprise and resentment I feel and get to the core of the living parts again. At least when the lava was flowing I could see I also cared. Now I just want to cry at my loss. I’m not closing the door to forgiving you and not feeling upset towards you&c;a& it is a bit mixed up when you want me to do things to help you feel safer in life and in the relationship and I feel trapped in this position&c;a& and one day I can feeling no hard feelings between us. Is it possible for me to get to the point of loving again? Well&c;a& I know empathy is required&c;a& and each time I was so sorry for how things were going and the hurt you must have felt and I remember being able to understand and temper my hurt by understanding you. As hurt as I was I also cared. I’m not sure why that empathy is so much harder to feel. Maybe because the last revelation was earlier? Before I had a chance to hurt you so it was random? Perhaps because they kept coming&c;a& and the last one was sort of like a trap. Perhaps because now it just doesn’t even seem comparable anymore and I gave you enough excuses. I don’t know I’m trying to understand right now while writing…. I’m not attempting to be mean&c;a& and I don’t mean to come off as hopeless&c;a& I’m just opening up my mind to see what I don’t let myself sometimes even say to myself so perhaps we can find a way forward.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n1KaXDvNY4X4MEyftz2xmq76UdZUseHiE68\n\nI think I had no idea that I wanted to be chosen (openly so&c;a& clearly) and that my partner wouldn't have romantic/deep/time consuming relationships with other women.\n\nAlso didn't think it was that important for my partner to commit clearly&c;a& to know what he wants&c;a& and to act on it with no hesitation.\n\nI knew a feeling of settling was and is important to me&c;a& and that was lacking from the start in all aspects of our relationship. I was aware of that&c;a& and I didn't know if/when you'd want to be more settled. Hence: the marriage proposal as an opportunity to really find out.\n\nWhat made you say \"you're giving me what you want most: to be in a relationship with me\"?\n\nLet me correct something: What I want most (in terms of relationships) is to be with someone who dedicates him/herself to being loving and caring. To be there no matter what.\n\nThis is what I am trying to give you&c;a& and it doesn't feel like you want it - makes sense&c;a& today.\n\nI think I could have set my Sway profile as \"only looking for long term exclusive relationships\"&c;a& had I known that's what I wanted. As you say: I am surprised I didn't leave. I care about you too&c;a& but that's not what made me stay: I can recognize now I was simply too scared to leave. I had found something exciting and meaningful&c;a& even if it was painful. The thrill was worth it apparently.\n\nDo you really think I wanted to be a mean person? I know you are not&c;a& I think no one really wants to be mean&c;a& except rare occasions maybe&c;a& but that's not us. I hurt you because I was hurt&c;a& with no intention to hurt you. The only time I hurt you intentionally was in Berlin&c;a& after spending time with Lisa and we were in that hotel room at night. I felt so disrespected and hurt I remember hitting your leg. I was very angry&c;a& and immediately regretted.\n\nI am not evil. I care for you&c;a& and I am damn clumsy. I have a hard time being articulate and understanding my needs and emotions. And I am also brave and willing to make things nice no matter what it takes&c;a& as long as there is respect. Maybe we're simply too different&c;a& incompatible in terms of what we need and have to offer. Maybe timing was off all along.\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nPromotes respect for human rights 2019-06-12 19:23:17 5Promotes respect for human rights\n\n3.5 trillion dollars in management -\n\nInvestor responsibility to uphold human rights\n\nSupport investors in engaging companies on human rights and due diligence\n\nWork with investors to activate their leverage to bring\n\n2018 - ICT - investor engagement on human rights\n\nAlliance to work with civil society - identify salient risks / impact on people - engage companies/inside/outside strategies\n\nSycamore asset management\n\nGNI SVP caliber investment\n\nInstitutional investors invest other people’s money in different asset classes\n\nInvestors have a responsibility inline\n\nOECD guidlines\n\nWhat it looks like for investors to be responsible business actors.\n\nInvestors need to consider human rights criteria throughout the investment lifecycle\n\nInvest/ornot and then engage the company - identify risks on salient\n\nInvestors can file shareholder resolutions\n\nAsking for human rights impact\n\nPromote public policies\n\nAsset managers\n\nFaith based institutions\n\nTarget the investors that are not acting responsibly\n\nRobeko middle sized asset manager in nederlands\n\n3-4-5k companies worldwide - part of the active ownership team\n\nEnvironmental social govornance - tracking - 14 people work on these issues.

It is Aurélien Devernois who presents with me this edition. Good evening Aurélien.\n\nAurélien Devernois:  Good evening.\n\nLB:  In the headlines tonight: Venezuela and the ultimatum of European countries coming to an end. 7 countries&c;a& including France&c;a& had given Nicolas Maduro this evening to call for a new presidential election.\n\nAD:  In El Salvador&c;a& the presidential election is precisely this Sunday. 5 million voters go to the polls. For the first time&c;a& he is a centrist who is a favorite of polls.\n\nLB:  And then we'll come back to this announcement from Benyamin Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister says he is ready to use force against Iran&c;a& which has just announced the test of a long-range missile.\n\n\\-----\n\nAD:  First of all&c;a& Venezuela&c;a& where President Nicolas Maduro has once again proposed legislative elections. While several countries of the European Union are asking for a presidential election.\n\nLB:  This is Germany&c;a& Spain&c;a& France&c;a& Netherlands&c;a& Portugal&c;a& United Kingdom and Austria. In contrast&c;a& Russia&c;a& China&c;a& North Korea&c;a& Turkey or Cuba support Nicolas Maduro who rejects the ultimatum of European countries that had given him until tonight to organize the election otherwise they recognize self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido. Moreover&c;a& this crisis in Venezuela has significantly reduced the return to the country of the currencies. This weekend&c;a& the company Noor Capital&c;a& based in Abu Dhabi&c;a& has finally confirmed having conducted a gold exchange for foreign exchange on behalf of the Republic of Venezuela. An operation carried out in the legality and in the respect of the international law according to this company&c;a& but which raises many criticisms from the part opposed to the power in place. The explanations of  Romain Lemaresquier.\n\nIt is the American senator Marco Rubio&c;a& a great critic of the regime of Nicolas Maduro&c;a& who had revealed the affair on social networks. And after a long silence: Noor Capital has finally confirmed having purchased 3 tons of gold reserves of the Venezuelan central bank&c;a& in exchange for foreign currency. An operation much criticized by the slayers of the Chavista regime who accuse Noor Capital of allowing the survival of a financially depressed regime. After recognizing this transaction&c;a& Noor Capital announced that it would no longer conduct any such transactions with the Venezuelan State until the situation stabilized. An announcement that puts an end to two other operations that were to be conducted soon according to Reuters. A total of 29 tons of gold were to be sold. 15 tons were expected to be shipped to the United Arab Emirates soon&c;a& while another 11 tons were to be sold in mid-February. Operations scrutinized especially by the United States who warned the banking institutions not to do business with Venezuelan gold. The flight of capital is one of the recurring themes in this Venezuelan crisis. And even within the Venezuelan central bank a resistance seems to be put in place. Some employees refuse that Venezuelan assets be squandered. Moreover&c;a& two of them were fired last week because they refused to let the gold out of the banking institution.\n\nLB:  I would add that Donald Trump reiterated that recourse to the US military in Venezuela was \"an option\" considered in the face of the political crisis that is shaking the country.\n\nAD:  In El Salvador&c;a& some 5 million voters have gone to the polls to elect their next president.\n\nLB:  Since the end of the civil war in 1992&c;a& two parties share the power: the ARENA&c;a& right&c;a& the ARENA&c;a& and the left party the FMLN&c;a& but today it is a candidate who is positioned rather in the center which is widely favored polls. His name is Nayib Bukélé&c;a& the GANA coalition candidate. He has campaigned on social networks&c;a& and his anti-corruption speech seduces&c;a& in a country largely affected by violence and poverty. Carlotta Morteo.\n\nJean&c;a& cap and leather jacket&c;a& impeccable beard&c;a& at 37&c;a& Nayib Bukele is the candidate for change. His credo: the fight against corruption. Its slogan: the end of impunity for elites who steal public money. The former mayor of San Salvador&c;a& who is of Palestinian origin and a professional publicist&c;a& enjoys a reputation as a good manager&c;a& and is known for securing and revitalizing the capital. In addition to his position neither left nor right&c;a& Nayib Bukele appealed to the youth and the urban middle class by his speeches on education&c;a& and his ideas to revive the economy: investment in industry&c;a& digital and agriculture by fiscal incentives and public subsidies&c;a& or tourism development&c;a& through the creation of a surf industry for example. All this&c;a& to stem the emigration of thousands of Salvadorans to the United States&c;a& and reduce the influence of criminal gangs. Gangs that have always had the means to influence the elections&c;a& and especially the participation rates. But given the huge gap in the polls between Nayib Bukele and his right-wing rival&c;a& millionaire Carlos Calleja&c;a& there is every chance that we will actually witness the end of bipartisanship in El Salvador.\n\nAD:  Electoral news again&c;a& but in Senegal with the beginning of the presidential campaign today.\n\nLB:  It will last three weeks&c;a& the first round is scheduled for February 24th. The outgoing Macky Sall&c;a& who is facing four other candidates&c;a& was holding a public meeting this Sunday in Touba. He hopes to be reelected in the first round as his predecessor Abdoulaye Wade in 2007.\n\nAD:  22h in Tel Aviv. Also in the news&c;a& this announcement of Benjamin Netanyahu to the attention of Iran.\n\nLB:  The Israeli prime minister warned this Sunday at the opening of the weekly cabinet meeting that his country will not hesitate to use force against Tehran&c;a& including during the election campaign. This threat comes the day after the test of a new cruise missile with a range greater than 1350 km&c;a& a test announced as a \"success\" by the Iranian regime. Listen to  Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"Today Iran celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and boasts of a new missile. Iran openly declares its intention to destroy the State of Israel. I have a clear message for the tyrants of Tehran: we know what you are doing and we know what you are about to do. We will continue to act against Iran with all the means at our disposal&c;a& so as to ensure the security of Israel and its future. \"\n\nAD:  In short&c;a& Theresa May reaffirms this Sunday her determination to execute Brexit on time.\n\nLB:  And with a revised divorce agreement with its European partners&c;a& this is what the British Prime Minister explains. While \"lingering uncertainty\" on this issue has pushed the Nissan car firm to give up an investment in England.\n\nAD:  In France&c;a& Emmanuel Macron in Paris suburbs on Monday. The Head of State will participate in a meeting in the context of the big debate.\n\nLB:  In Evry-Courcouronnes&c;a& precisely&c;a& this is the first time that the President carries the subject in the suburbs. Immediately you have an appointment with  Yvan Amar.\n\nA General of the Venezuelan Air Force has just sworn allegiance to Guaido. Not surprising information&c;a& but it revolves around this expression \"to make allegiance\". His meaning is very simple and very clear: General Yanez Rodriguez no longer recognizes the authority of Maduro and sided with Guaido. He changes his leader! He was under the authority of the President of the Republic. He places himself deliberately&c;a& that is to say on purpose&c;a& under that of the one who disputes him the power. He affirms his loyalty to the man who presents himself as the new head of state. The word&c;a& in French&c;a& comes from the Middle Ages and feudal practices&c;a& that is to say&c;a& which regulates the relations between the different lords. It is a hierarchy&c;a& that is to say an organization of powers&c;a& quite precise: each lord is under the authority of another&c;a& and that goes back to the king&c;a& who is only under the authority of God. He who has authority is the suzerain. He who obeys him is the vassal. And each noble is suzerain of him to whom he commands&c;a& and vassal of him to whom he obeys. And to make allegiance is to recognize someone&c;a& officially and solemnly&c;a& as his overlord. The expression can be used&c;a& as is the case here&c;a& if one changes sides: one shows it by designating the one one accepts as his superior. But we often hear the formula if someone has decided to have no leader at all&c;a& to be on his own&c;a& to admit no one's authority. And then things do not work as expected. The rebel does not escape&c;a& and he decides to return to the rank and again to obey a tutelage: he pledges allegiance to the one who represents this authority. -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nservane.briot@gmail.com to Lebanon! 2019-01-20 00:24:46 servane.briot@gmail.com to Lebanon! -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nFernando Pessoa - portugaise writer 2019-01-19 23:30:37 Fernando Pessoa - portugaise writer\n\nkhalil Gibran similar\n\nDied at 40\n\nNovalis - writer&c;a& German - romanticism\n\nMovie called borders she smells fear and guilt\n\ntessa.de.baudiniere@gmail.com\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nCheck this out later 2018-12-30 00:38:19 Check this out later\n\n￼\n\n/Users/bilalghalib/Downloads/all Audio/AnyTrans-Export-2023-07-25/Notes/Notes/Attachments/AcBC5rFUBL6FVAzpn1DDDaZFtp6p\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nNarjeel wood did mwabah 2018-12-23 14:12:28 Narjeel wood did mwabah\n\nKhidhr wood Misbaha\n\nPlan responses to failures :)\n\nHasibah\n\nPunka\n\nSarsari\n\nTsay hay\n\nBaltaji\n\nYataawlef\n\nHeetchi?

A term that seemed to me then excluding for the girl little feminine and flirt that I was.\n\nFirst&c;a& my personal quest for truth forced me to exclude the wearing of a mask. But how to determine what is a personal choice of what is social convention? The border was thin&c;a& and the reasons for my refusal of makeup more numerous.\n\nThe societal consensus around a feminine ideal is&c;a& of course&c;a& binding for women in the first place&c;a& but also for men&c;a& who unconsciously integrate this model of beauty - which I do not wish to perpetuate.\n\nIn a second time&c;a& I questioned the usefulness of make-up in a context of personal confidence. If such a small detail can contribute to the improvement of personal well-being&c;a& is not it worth it to pay attention to it?\n\nAfter a few months of use&c;a& I developed a psychological dependence on this seemingly precarious apparatus. This thin layer of pigments alone had inhibited my ability to accept some of my appearance - my skin&c;a& my face! - and developed in parallel an addiction to - not a feeling of well-being - but the absence of malaise.\n\nBecause wearing this makeup that hides a few buttons and highlights my blue eyes&c;a& it was not a way to accentuate my confidence and my strengths&c;a& it was now a necessity to make them exist.\n\nConscious of this discomfort&c;a& I proceeded by step to detox me gently. My cure was to remove one ingredient at a time&c;a& then choose a \"no\" day&c;a& until you reach a majority of \"no\" days a week.\n\nOf course the days of greatest importance were those where I exposed myself to the greatest number of social interactions&c;a& and those days represented huge steps to be taken for my personal self-esteem.\n\nBecause if my confidence in me is far from being reduced to my mere appearance&c;a& the environment in which I evolve does not deprive myself of judging me on this criterion \"at first sight\".\n\nToday&c;a& -\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\n1205 West sherwin 2018-02-01 05:04:47 205 West sherwin\n\n60626\n\n3pm\n\nEagle hart\n\n802 buzzer\n\nBryant\n\nIski\n\n2852 7478\n\nMonday at noisebridge\n\nFriday at Sean breakfast\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nLinkx 2017-12-30 01:33:37 Linkx\n\nLinz\n\nhttps://twitter.com/daytradernik/status/946665180968210432\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tehmoonwalker/status/946875919691546624\n\nMsp\n\nNebl\n\nhttps://twitter.com/\\_tm3k/status/946877413249638400\n\nBytecoin\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cryptogat/status/946835652469026816\n\nFrom bags move over bought into oversold strategy\n\n\\-\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle Create Date Notes Attachments\n\nThe rainforest book.com 2017-11-14 08:10:56 The rainforest book.com\n\nBuilding startup communities\n\nBrian fled\n\nActed Iraq\n\nJeankarinthi@gmail.com\n\nChristian.bockarie@paris.fr\n\nEmbrace of the serpent\n\n#HappyHalloween from @qrs and the @fbi paranormal investigations unit 👻🌈💕 #WeGotThis instagram.com/p/Ba4TkVHHr8-/\n\nارسل رسالة فارغة على الرقم 1121 للتبرع ب1$ لمسنين بيت رفقا.بدعمكم منكمل المشوار.\n\nHello&c;a& I'd like to wear this scent behind my ears.
