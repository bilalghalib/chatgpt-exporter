  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user shared a Wikipedia guide on AI writing detection and asked Claude to create a practical checklist for avoiding LLM-style writing patterns. Claude developed a comprehensive checklist organized into categories including language patterns to avoid (phrases like \"testament to,\" \"plays a vital role,\" \"it's important to note\"), formatting issues (excessive boldface, title case headings, unnecessary bullet lists), communication style problems (collaborative language, disclaimers, apologies), and content approach issues (superficial analysis, editorializing, promotional language). The checklist also included positive alternatives like using varied sentence structures and letting facts speak for themselves.\n\nThe user then asked Claude to apply this checklist to analyze a LinkedIn post about Silicon Valley's role in existential threats. Claude created a detailed table identifying multiple LLM indicators present in the text, including \"role\" language, excessive emphasis on importance, rule of three constructions, parallel structures, collaborative user-directed language, and promotional tone. Claude concluded the text showed strong LLM indicators despite being formatted for social media.\n\nWhen the user asked for a cleaned version, Claude provided a rewrite that removed the problematic elements but made a critical error by fabricating participant quotes that weren't in the original text. The user immediately corrected this, pointing out the fictional quotes. Claude acknowledged the mistake and provided a final version that used only information from the original text while maintaining engagement through specificity, visual hierarchy with bullet points, and direct factual presentation rather than performative language. The conversation demonstrated the practical application of the anti-LLM checklist while highlighting the importance of accuracy and not adding fictional details.",

While they perform better than random chance, these tools have high error rates and cannot replace human judgment.\nA screenshot of ChatGPT reading: \"[header] Legacy & Interpretation [body] The \"Black Hole Edition\" is not just a meme — it's a celebration of grassroots car culture, where ideas are limitless and fun is more important than spec sheets. Whether powered by a rotary engine, a V8 swap, or an imagined fighter jet turbine, the Miata remains the canvas for car enthusiasts worldwide.\"\nLLMs tend to have an identifiable writing style.\nThis is a list of writing and formatting conventions typical of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, with real examples taken from Wikipedia articles and drafts. Its purpose is to act as a field guide in helping detect undisclosed AI-generated content. Note that not all text featuring the following indicators is AI-generated; large language models (LLMs), which power AI-chatbots, have been trained on human writing, and some people may share a similar writing style.\n\nThe listed observations are empirical statements, not normative statements (except notes on how strong an indicator something should be taken to be). The latter are contained in Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Any normative content about what kind of formatting or language not to use in articles is not topical here; it might belong in (and is probably already present in) the Manual of Style.\n\nThe speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which is detailed in § Communication intended for the user and the other two in § Citations. Other signs are not sufficient by themselves for this criterion but are indicators that the text should be handled per the guidelines at Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content and Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide.\n\nSigns of AI writing should be treated as signs of a potential problem, not the problem itself. While their superficial problems are often immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor wordsmithing, broken markup, citation style quirks, stray text—they can point to an underlying issue with LLM-generated content with more serious policy risks. The hardest cases are those where the LLM-generated text has been polished enough (whether by the original editor or subsequent editors or bots) to hide these surface defects, while the dire internal problems persist. Depending on the circumstances, it may be unwise to fix those outward issues without also addressing or flagging those deeper concerns.\n\nLanguage and tone\nShortcuts\nWP:AIWTW\nWP:AI-ISM\nUndue emphasis on symbolism and importance\nWords to watch: is/stands as/serves as a testament, plays a vital/significant role, underscores its importance, continues to captivate, leaves a lasting impact, watershed moment, key turning point, deeply rooted, profound heritage, steadfast dedication, stands as a, solidifies ...\nLLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter with reminders that it represents or contributes to a broader topic. There seems to be only a small repertoire of ways that it writes these reminders, so if they are otherwise appropriate it would be best to reword them anyway.\n\nWhen talking about biology (e.g. when asked to discuss a given animal or plant species), LLMs tend to put too much emphasis on the species' conservation status and the efforts to protect it, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist.\n\nExamples\n\nDouera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a dynamic hub of activity and culture. With its coastal charm and convenient location, Douera captivates both residents and visitors alike[...]\n\n— From this revision to Douéra\nBerry Hill today stands as a symbol of community resilience, ecological renewal, and historical continuity. Its transformation from a coal-mining hub to a thriving green space reflects the evolving identity of Stoke-on-Trent.\n\n— From Draft:Berry Hill, Stoke-on-Trent\nPromotional language\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Puffery.\nShortcuts\nWP:AIPUFFERY\nWP:AIPEACOCK\nWords to watch: rich cultural heritage, rich history, breathtaking, must-visit, must-see, stunning natural beauty, enduring/lasting legacy, rich cultural tapestry, nestled, in the heart of  ...\nLLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially when writing about something that could be considered \"cultural heritage\"—in which case they will constantly remind the reader that it is cultural heritage.\n\nExamples\n\nNestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and a significant place within the Amhara region. From its scenic landscapes to its historical landmarks, Alamata Raya Kobo offers visitors a fascinating glimpse into the diverse tapestry of Ethiopia. In this article, we will explore the unique characteristics that make Alamata Raya Kobo a town worth visiting and shed light on its significance within the Amhara region.\n\n— From this revision to Alamata (woreda)\nTTDC acts as the gateway to Tamil Nadu’s diverse attractions, seamlessly connecting the beginning and end of every traveller's journey.

Editorializing can appear through specific words or phrases or within broader sentence structures. This indicator often overlaps with other language and tone indicators in this list. Note that humans and especially new editors often make this mistake as well.\n\nExamples\n\nA defining feature of FSP models is their ability to simulate environmental interactions.\n\n— From Draft:Functional-Structural Plant Models\nTheir ability to simulate both form and function makes them powerful tools for understanding plant-environment interactions and optimizing performance under diverse biological and management contexts.\n\n— From the same page\nIn this case, the whole sentence comprises an original opinion:\n\nThese partnerships reflect the company’s role in serving both corporate and community organizations in Uganda.\n\n— From Draft:GEOWISE MEDIA\nOveruse of certain conjunctions\nWords to watch: on the other hand, moreover, in addition, furthermore ...\nWhile moderate use of connecting words or phrases is an essential element of good prose, LLMs tend to overuse them. This overuse often is a byproduct of an essay-like tone which is typical of LLM writing but is inappropriate for Wikipedia. Certain conjunctives such as 'however' or 'in contrast' inherently imply synthesis of facts, and are generally unsuitable for Wikipedia articles.\n\nExamples\n\nAI-generated example\nCompare the above with below human-written prose. Even disregarding the absence of buzzwords and general vapidness, the connecting phrases in the below excerpt are more varied and less conspicuous.\n\nHuman-written example\nSection summaries\nShortcuts\nWP:CONCLUSION\nWP:INCONCLUSION\nWords to watch: In summary, In conclusion, Overall ...\nLLMs will often end a paragraph or section by summarizing and restating its core idea. While this may be permitted for some scholarly writing, proper Wikipedia writing typically never summarizes the general idea of a block of article text (besides the lead section being a summary of the entire article).\n\nExamples\n\nIn summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research. This structured pathway ensures that nurse scientists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of nursing science.\n\n— From this revision in Nurse scientist\nNegative parallelisms\nShortcut\nWP:AIPARALLEL\nParallel constructions involving \"not\", \"but\", or \"however\" such as \"Not only ... but ...\" or \"It is not just about ..., it's ...\" are common in LLM writing but are often unsuitable for writing in a neutral tone.\n\nExamples\n\nSelf-Portrait by Yayoi Kusama, executed in 2010 and currently preserved in the famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence, constitutes not only a work of self-representation, but a visual document of her obsessions, visual strategies and psychobiographical narratives.\n\n— From this revision to Self-portrait (Yayoi Kusama)\nIt’s not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it’s part of the aggression and atmosphere.\n\n— From this revision to Draft:Critikal! The Rapper\nHere is an example of a negative parallelism across multiple sentences:\n\nHe hailed from the esteemed Duse family, renowned for their theatrical legacy. Eugenio's life, however, took a path that intertwined both personal ambition and familial complexities.\n\n— From this revision to Eugenio Duse\nSome parallelisms may follow the pattern of \"No ..., no ..., just ...\":\n\nThere are no long-form profiles. No editorial insights. No coverage of her game dev career. No notable accolades. Just TikTok recaps and callouts.\n\n— From Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lilly Contino\nRule of three\nLLMs overuse the 'rule of three'—\"the good, the bad, and the ugly\". This can take different forms from \"adjective, adjective, adjective\" to \"short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase\".\n\nWhilst the 'rule of three', when used sparingly, is considered good writing, LLMs seem to rely heavily on it so the superficial explanations appear more comprehensive. Furthermore, this rule is generally suited to creative or argumentative writing, not purely informational texts.\n\nExamples\n\nThe Amaze Conference brings together global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers to discuss the latest trends in digital marketing. The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities.\n\n— From Draft:Amaze Conference\nSuperficial analyses\nWords to watch: ensuring ..., highlighting ..., emphasizing ..., reflecting ...\nAI chatbots tend to superficially comment on or analyze information, often in relation to its significance, recognition, or impact. This is often done by attaching a present participle (\"-ing\") phrase at the end of sentences, sometimes with vague attributions to third parties (see below). These comments are generally unhelpful and introduce unnecessary or fictional opinions.\n\nExamples\n\nIn 2025, the Federation was internationally recognized and invited to participate in the Asia Pickleball Summit, highlighting Pakistan’s entry into the global pickleball community.\n\n— From this revision to Draft:Pakistan Pickleball Federation\nConsumers benefit from the flexibility to use their preferred mobile wallet at participating merchants, improving convenience.\n\n— From Draft:MyanmarPay MMQR\nThese citations, spanning more than six decades and appearing in recognized academic publications, illustrate Blois' lasting influence in computational linguistics, grammar, and neology.\n\n— From Draft:Jacques Blois (linguist)\nThe civil rights movement emerged as a powerful continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice.\n\n— From this revision to African-American culture\nVague attributions of opinion\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Unsupported attributions.\nShortcut\nWP:AIWEASEL\nWords to watch: Industry reports, Observers have cited, Some critics argue ...\nAI chatbots tend to attribute opinions or claims to some vague authority—a practice called weasel wording—while citing only one or two sources which may or may not actually express such view. They also tend to overgeneralize a perspective of one or few sources into that of a wider group.\n\nExamples\n\nHere, the weasel wording implies the opinion comes from an independent source, but it actually cites Nick Ford's own website.\n\nHis [Nick Ford's] compositions have been described as exploring conceptual themes and bridging the gaps between artistic media.[1]\n\n— Draft:Nick Ford (musician)\nDue to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Efforts are ongoing to monitor its ecological health and preserve the surrounding grassland environment, which is part of a larger initiative to protect China’s semi-arid ecosystems from degradation.\n\n— From this revision to Haolai River\nReferences\n\n \"About\". Nick Ford. Retrieved 2025-06-25.\nFigurative use of from and to\nShortcuts\nWP:FROMXTOY\nWP:FALSERANGE\nWhen giving examples of items within a set, AI chatbots will often figuratively use phrasing that takes the form of \"from ... to ...\", which often leads to a non-encyclopedic tone. This indicator is not to be confused with the prepositions' non-figurative usage, such as in real-life spatial context (e.g. \"... went from Chicago to Los Angeles\").\n\nExamples\n\nOur journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars that forge the elements of life, to the enigmatic dance of dark matter and dark energy that shape its destiny.\n\n[...]\n\nIntelligence and Creativity: From problem-solving and tool-making to scientific discovery, artistic expression, and technological innovation, human intelligence is characterized by its adaptability and capacity for novel solutions.\n\n[...]\n\nContinued Scientific Discovery: The quest to understand the universe, life, and ourselves will continue to drive scientific breakthroughs, from fundamental physics to medicine and neuroscience.\n\n— From Draft:The Cosmos Unveiled: A Grand Tapestry of Existence\nStyle\nTitle case in section headings\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters § Headings, headers, and captions.\nShortcut\nWP:AITITLECASE\nIn section headings, AI chatbots strongly tend to consistently capitalize all main words (title case).\n\nExamples\n\nEarly Life and Education\nThomas was born in Cochranville, Pennsylvania.

Thomas\nExcessive use of boldface\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting § Boldface.\nShortcut\nWP:AIBOLD\nAI chatbots may display various phrases in boldface for emphasis in a manner that is excessive and can seem rather mechanical. One of their tendencies, inherited from readmes, fan wikis, how-tos, sales copies, listicles and other materials that might involve heavy use of boldface, is picking a type of word or object to emphasize and emphasizing every instance of it—without being able to \"reflect\" on the end result and evaluate it as unsatisfactory. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.\n\nExamples\n\nIt blends OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and visual strategy tools such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and Balanced Scorecard (BSC). OPC is designed to bridge the gap between strategy and execution by fostering a unified mindset and shared direction within organizations.\n\n— From Draft:One Page 4 Change (OPC)\nLists\nShortcut\nWP:AILIST\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists § Use prose where understood easily.\nAI chatbots often organize the contents of their responses into lists that are formatted in a particular way.\n\nLists that are copied and pasted from AI chatbot responses may retain their original formatting. Instead of proper wikitext, a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as 1.) instead of standard wikitext.\n\nExamples\n\n1. Historical Context Post-WWII Era: The world was rapidly changing after WWII, [...] 2. Nuclear Arms Race: Following the U.S. atomic bombings, the Soviet Union detonated its first bomb in 1949, [...] 3.

AI chatbots may or may not add a space before and after the dash.\n\nExamples\n\nThe term “Dutch Caribbean” is not used in the statute and is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people of the autonomous countries themselves. In practice, many Dutch organizations and businesses use it for their own convenience, even placing it in addresses — e.g., “Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean” — but this only adds confusion internationally and erases national identity. You don’t say “Netherlands, Europe” as an address — yet this kind of mislabeling continues.\n\n— From this revision to Talk:Dutch Caribbean\nCurly quotation marks and apostrophes\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Quotation characters, and Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Apostrophes.\nShortcut\nWP:AICURLY\nAI chatbots typically use curly quotation marks (“...” or ‘...’) instead of straight quotation marks (\"...\" or '...'). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. Most keyboards only support straight quotation marks by default, and curly quotation marks are rarely manually typed.\n\nThey also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’; the same character as the curly right single quotation mark) instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in contractions and possessive forms. They may also do this inconsistently.\n\nCurly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. Microsoft Word as well as macOS and iOS devices have a \"smart quotes\" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as LanguageTool may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like Citer may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example,\n\nMcClelland, Mac (2017-09-27). \"When 'Not Guilty' Is a Life Sentence\". The New York Times.

Many messages emphasize a user's good faith and promise that the user will adhere to Wikipedia's guidelines. The presence of a subject line above the text, intended to fill the Subject line on an email form, is a more definitive tell.\n\nExamples\n\nAI-generated example from a talk page\nAI-generated example from a deletion discussion\nExample of an AI-generated undeletion request\nExample of an AI-generated unblock request\nKeep in mind that not all messages written this way are necessarily AI-generated.

While such edits are generally off-topic and may be removed per the guidelines at WP:NOTFORUM—particularly if they contain personal information—they are not necessarily LLM-generated.\n\nHuman-written offtopic letter\nCommunication intended for the user\nCollaborative communication\nShortcuts\nWP:CERTAINLY\nWP:AITALKINARTICLE\nWP:COLLABCOMM\nWords to watch: I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, Would you like..., is there anything else, let me know, more detailed breakdown, here is a ...\nIn some cases, editors will paste text from an AI chatbot that it had intended as correspondence, prewriting or advice for them, and not for direct use in an article. AI chatbots may also explicitly indicate that the text is for a Wikipedia article if prompted to produce one, and may mention various policies and guidelines in their outputs; such mentions are generally inappropriate for direct inclusion in articles.\n\nExamples\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the background information related to the topic of the report. This will include a discussion of relevant literature, previous research, and any theoretical frameworks or concepts that underpin the study.

The village’s scenery [...] could be illustrated with an image. Several such photographs are available (e.g., on Wikimedia Commons) that show Ronco’s panoramic view, [...] Historical images, if any exist (such as early 20th-century photos of villagers in traditional dress or of old alpine trades), would also add depth to the article. Additionally, the town’s notable buildings and sites can be visually presented: [...] Including an image of the Santuario di San Besso [...] could further engage readers. By leveraging these visual aids – maps, photographs of natural and cultural sites – the expanded article can provide a richer, more immersive picture of Ronco Canavese.\n\n— From this revision to Ronco Canavese\nKnowledge-cutoff disclaimers and speculation about gaps in sources\nShortcuts\nWP:AICUTOFF\nWP:AIDISCLAIMER\nWords to watch: as of [date],[a] Up to my last training update, as of my last knowledge update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., not widely available/documented/disclosed, ...in the provided/available sources/search results..., based on available information ...\nA knowledge-cutoff disclaimer is a statement used by the AI chatbot to indicate that the information provided may be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated.\n\nIf an LLM has a fixed knowledge cutoff (usually the model's last training update), it is unable to provide any information on events or developments past that time, and it will often output a disclaimer to remind the user of this cutoff, which usually takes the form of a statement that says the information provided is accurate only up to a certain date.\n\nIf an LLM with retrieval-augmented generation (for example, an AI chatbot that can search the web) fails to find sources on a given topic, or if information is not included in sources provided to it in a prompt, it will often output a statement to that effect, which is similar to a knowledge-cutoff disclaimer. It may also pair it with text about what that information \"likely\" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely speculative (including the very claim that it's \"not documented\") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated. It is also frequently combined with the tells above.\n\nExamples\n\nWhile specific information about the fauna of Studniční hora is limited in the provided search results, the mountain likely supports...\n\n— From this revision to Studniční hora\nThough the details of these resistance efforts aren't widely documented, they highlight her bravery...\n\n— From this revision to Throwing Curves: Eva Zeisel\nNo significant public controversies or security incidents affecting Outpost24 have been documented as of June 2025.\n\n— From Draft:Outpost24\nAs of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about the current status or developments related to the \"Chester Mental Health Center\" in today's era.\n\n— From this revision to Chester Mental Health Center\nBelow is a detailed overview based on available information:\n\n— From Draft:The Good, The Bad, The Dollar Menu 2\n not unique to AI chatbots; is produced by the {{as of}} template\nPrompt refusal\nWords to watch: as an AI language model, as a large language model, I'm sorry ...\nOccasionally, the AI chatbot will decline to answer a prompt as it is written, usually with an apology and a reminder that it is \"an AI language model\". Attempting to be as helpful as possible, it often gives suggestions or an answer to an alternative, similar request.\n\nAlthough they may look obviously unacceptable for additions to a Wikipedia article, AI contributions do sometimes include prompt refusals. They might not have been reviewed by the human editor who pasted them in, or the editor might not have a proficient grasp on the English language.

As wikitext is mostly tied to a specific platform using a specific software (a wiki running on MediaWiki), it is a niche markup language, lacking wider exposure beyond Wikipedia and other MediaWiki-based platforms like Miraheze. As such, LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data—while the corpuses of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: Markdown. Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using it, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia articles look like formatted documents.\n\nWhen asked about its \"formatting guidelines\", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level instructions will typically disclose some variation of the following (this is Microsoft Copilot in mid-2025):\n\n## Formatting Guidelines\n\n- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.  \n- Use a single main title (`#`) and clear primary subheadings (`##`).  \n- Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences, ≤150 words).  \n- Break large topics into labeled subsections.  \n- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.  \n- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.  \n- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.  \n- Use horizontal dividers (`---`) between major sections.  \n- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.  \n- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.  \n- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.  \n- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.  \nAs the above already suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.\n\nEven when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using syntactically correct wikitext, as their inherent architectural biases and training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in Markdown. When told by a user to \"generate an article\", a chatbot will typically default to using Markdown for the generated output, which would be preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed by a user to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might itself \"realize\" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include something like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (`wikitext`)? in its output. If told to proceed, the resulting syntax will generally be rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style fenced code block (its syntax for WP:PRE) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: ```wikitext.\n\nThe presence of faulty wikitext syntax that mixes in Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone is not such a strong indicator. Particularly, software developers, researchers, technical writers, and internet users in general frequently use Markdown in tools like Obsidian and GitHub, and on platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Slack. Software that editors may use to write content intended for Wikipedia, such as iOS Notes, Google Docs, and Windows Notepad, may support Markdown editing or exporting. The contemporary ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.\n\nExamples\n\nSee also: Markdown § Examples\nI believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** — not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being “unhelpful”, and a general impression that I am \"not here to build an encyclopedia\". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments \"AI-generated\" — without explaining how they are substantively flawed.\n\n— From this revision to a user talk page\n- The Wikipedia entry does not explicitly mention the \"Cyberhero League\" being recognized as a winner of the World Future Society's BetaLaunch Technology competition, as detailed in the interview with THE FUTURIST ([1](https://consciouscreativity.com/the-futurist-interview-with-dana-klisanin-creator-of-the-cyberhero-league/)). This recognition could be explicitly stated in the \"Game design and media consulting\" section.\n\n— From this revision to Talk:Dana Klisanin\nHere, LLMs incorrectly use ## to denote section headings, which MediaWiki interprets as a numbered list.\n\nGeography\nVillers-Chief is situated in the Jura Mountains, in the eastern part of the Doubs department.

They also may treat ordinary references to topics as categories and then generate non-existent categories.

Most links become broken (see link rot) over time, but those factors make it unlikely that the link was ever valid.\n\nInvalid DOI and ISBNs\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see Wikipedia:DOI and Wikipedia:ISBN.\nA checksum can be used to verify ISBNs. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates will display a warning if so. Similarly, DOIs are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of hallucinated references.\n\nRelated are DOIs that point to entirely different article and general book citations without pages. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.\n\nOhm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1]. Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are \"ohmic,\" meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors [2][3].\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. ISBN 9780470521571.\n\n2. M. E.

Worse, both Proceedings of the IEEE citations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to completely different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, C. L. Fortescue was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and Vol 55, Issue 11 does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 3. Note also the use of curly quotation marks and apostrophes in some, but not all, of the above text, another indicator that text may be LLM-generated.\n\nIncorrect or unconventional use of references\nShortcut\nWP:AICITESTYLE\nAI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so just like Wikipedia often expects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.\n\nIn the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.\n\nIn this case, the Smith, R. J. source – being the \"third source\" the tool presumably generated the link 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3' (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{cite journal}} reference, even though the links resolve.\n\nThe LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.\n\nFor over thirty years, computers have been utilized in the rehabilitation of individuals with brain injuries. Initially, researchers delved into the potential of developing a \"prosthetic memory.\"<ref>Fowler R, Hart J, Sheehan M. A prosthetic memory: an application of the prosthetic environment concept. ''Rehabil Counseling Bull''. 1972;15:80–85.</ref> However, by the early 1980s, the focus shifted towards addressing brain dysfunction through repetitive practice.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=R.

Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited and further responses will require the user to select \"continue generating\".\n\nThis method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also result in a similar situation. It may also be indicative of a copyright violation rather than the use of an LLM.\n\nDiscrepancies in writing style and variety of English\nA sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar, may indicate the use of AI tools.\n\nAnother discrepancy is a mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; yet, the default variety of LLM outputs is American English, and such a user's AI-generated content will exhibit this variety (unless the chatbot was specifically prompted to use Indian English). However, note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties. Such signs should only raise suspicion if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.\n\nSee also\nWikipedia:Artificial intelligence\nCategories: WikiProject adviceWikipedia and artificial intelligence\nThis page was last edited on 31 August 2025, at 04:11 (UTC).\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License; additional terms may apply.
