(yes and or no method)\nThen explain “yes and” is good because it’s positive, and it feels good when your friends agree with your idea, right? And you can build on top of it to create really good and complete ideas. You can go deeper and come up with things that you normally wouldn’t have discovered.\n“No” is also good, as it generates a wide variety of ideas. And in real life when you talk about your idea to someone not everybody is positive and will like your idea. Sometimes you have to say no!\n\nRecap: As a rule at Five One Labs, we try to use the “yes and” method. We want to build off and support each other.\n\n4\n\nDesign Sprint!\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\nOk great! I hope you had some fun and got to know the people sitting around you a little bit more. \nWe are now going to get into the first design thinking session of Ignite, the Design Sprint! We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources. But first, we will give you a little introduction to the Design curriculum and an overview of the design thinking methodology.\n5\n\n\nFeb. 2, 2020:\t\t      Introduction to Design Thinking\nFeb. 2, 2020:\t\t      User Research\nFeb. 16, 2020:\t      Define the Problem\nFeb. 20, 2020:\t\tCreativity and Ideation\n \n \n\nDESIGN THINKING SCHEDULE\nApril 1\nIntro to design thinking\nApril 1\nApril 7\nApril 8\nUser research\nDefine the problem\nCreativity and ideation\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nQuickly give an overview of the 4 Design sessions they will have over the next two weeks. \nIntroduction to Design Thinking: We will focus on giving you a good understanding of design thinking and the human centered design process today through a design sprint. Starting this afternoon, we will talk about applying the Design Thinking methodology to your business.\nUser Research: We will go into creating a research plan for you to deeply understand your customers and their needs.\nReframe: Define the Problem: We will take all of our research, and clearly define the problem for your different customer types.\nCreativity and Ideation: Finally, we will generate solutions to your customers problems. Some of them might be your current ideas, but we hope to generate a wide variety of ideas that could all be potential solutions. \n6\n\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What is design thinking? Why is it useful?\nPotential answers:\nA way to take a messy problem and turn it into something much more clear and more ordered\nA way to enhance your creativity, build stronger, more innovative solutions\nTo build a deeper understanding of people \nHuman centered, iterative, collaborative, experiential \nThere is a bias towards action\nYou should work to embody these mindsets throughout the rest of this sprint\n\n7\n\nincreased creativity\nstronger solutions\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe trainer should recap points brought up on the previous slide answering “What is design thinking? Why is it useful?”\nA way to take a messy problem and turn it into something much more clear and more ordered\nA way to enhance your creativity, build stronger, more innovative solutions\nTo build a deeper understanding of people \nHuman centered, iterative, collaborative, experiential \nThere is a bias towards action\nYou should work to embody these mindsets throughout the rest of this sprint\n\n8\n\nCC, BY-NC-ND, ⓒ Joe Thorn\nDiscussion: 5 minutes \n\nAsk: Take a look at this photo – who can tell me what this girl needs? (gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc… \n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap \nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc… \nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses. \nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved? \n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things? \n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs \nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box. \nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!! (alone)\n Offer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\n Send the entrepreneurs in the other room where prototyping supplies are laid out for them.\n How might this solution fit into the context of your partner’s life? \n Improve and build out the concept you talked about\n17\n\nFEEDBACK\n20 minutes: Activity\n\n6 minutes: Feedback (3 mins each) \nRemember, your idea is not precious, feedback is just a way to learn more\nGenerate more feedback\nWrite down how they feel about it\nWatch how they use it, misuse it, what mistakes are they making, what doesn’t make sense, etc\nWrite down one new idea, one big question from feedback. Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\n \n10 minutes: Debrief \nHow did discussing and gathering feedback from the person change how your final solution looks?\nIf you had to make it for yourself, would it look the same as it did for your partner?\nWho ended up with something their partner really liked? Why? What about it stood out? \nWhat would you change in your next iteration?\nWhat part was most uncomfortable? What was most natural? \nHow was it as a user interacting with the prototype? \n\n18\n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nBriefly explain again how they just went through the whole design thinking process in under an hour\nExplain that during Ignite, we will go through the first 3 steps, and then the incubator we will do the last 2 steps\nWrap up for lunch\n\n19\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nAny Questions?]]]Stage 2: Module Scoring Prompt\nINSTRUCTIONS\nYou are a curriculum consultant specializing in integrating climate resilience into entrepreneurship training.

(gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc… \n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap \nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc… \nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses. \nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved? \n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things? \n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs \nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box. \nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!! (alone)\n Offer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\n Send the entrepreneurs in the other room where prototyping supplies are laid out for them.\n How might this solution fit into the context of your partner’s life? \n Improve and build out the concept you talked about\n17\n\nFEEDBACK\n20 minutes: Activity\n\n6 minutes: Feedback (3 mins each) \nRemember, your idea is not precious, feedback is just a way to learn more\nGenerate more feedback\nWrite down how they feel about it\nWatch how they use it, misuse it, what mistakes are they making, what doesn’t make sense, etc\nWrite down one new idea, one big question from feedback. Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\n \n10 minutes: Debrief \nHow did discussing and gathering feedback from the person change how your final solution looks?\nIf you had to make it for yourself, would it look the same as it did for your partner?\nWho ended up with something their partner really liked? Why? What about it stood out? \nWhat would you change in your next iteration?\nWhat part was most uncomfortable? What was most natural? \nHow was it as a user interacting with the prototype? \n\n18\n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nBriefly explain again how they just went through the whole design thinking process in under an hour\nExplain that during Ignite, we will go through the first 3 steps, and then the incubator we will do the last 2 steps\nWrap up for lunch\n\n19\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nAny Questions?]]]Stage 2: Module Scoring Prompt\nINSTRUCTIONS\nYou are a curriculum consultant specializing in integrating climate resilience into entrepreneurship training.

Frame it as “cost-effective and easily accessible materials.” | Maintains an environmental impact while making it about economic efficiency. |\n| **Feedback & Testing (Slide 18)** | Entrepreneurs test solutions. | Include a question: “What happens if materials or costs change unexpectedly? Can your solution adapt?” | Introduces resource scarcity concerns in a way that encourages resilience and flexibility. |\n\n---\n\n### **Table 3: Resource Needs (Framing for Practicality)**\n_Adding useful tools under the lens of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and resilience rather than climate-specific language._\n\n| Resource Type | Current Status | Needed Addition | Purpose |\n|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------|\n| **Case Studies** | No climate-specific examples. | Short examples of businesses that survived market shifts by being efficient (e.g., using less energy, reducing costs, adapting supply chains). | Shows real-world applications without a “climate” label. |\n| **Worksheets** | General problem-framing templates. | **Adaptive Business Strategy Worksheet** (see below). | Helps entrepreneurs consider risks broadly, including climate but not explicitly. |\n| **Materials for Prototyping** | Standard materials. | Only allow “cost-effective, accessible” materials (which are sustainable by default). | Reinforces sustainable product design subtly. |\n\n---\n\n### **Worksheets**\nSubtle reworking of worksheets to encourage climate resilience thinking **without** explicitly framing it as an environmental issue.\n\n#### **1. Adaptive Business Strategy Worksheet**\n_For use during **User Research (Slide 12-13) & Business Model Refinement (Slide 15-18)**_\n\n| Business Idea | External Risks (Economic, Supply, Energy, Market) | Resource Constraints | Adaptation Strategies |\n|--------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| (e.g., food delivery) | Fuel prices rising, unreliable electricity | High fuel costs, lack of refrigeration | Bicycle delivery, insulated storage, solar-powered freezers |\n\n📌 **How it works:**  \n- Entrepreneurs brainstorm risks without explicitly mentioning climate.\n- Climate-related factors (like heat, supply chain issues) will emerge organically as part of business risk planning.\n\n#### **2. Local Efficiency Challenge**\n_For use during **Prototyping (Slide 16-17) & Testing (Slide 18)**_\n\n| Prototype Element | Imported or Local? | High or Low Energy Use? | Can It Be Made More Efficient? |\n|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Material Choice | Imported plastic | High energy | Replace with recycled material |\n| Energy Usage | Requires battery | Moderate | Use solar-charged alternative |\n\n📌 **How it works:**  \n- Instead of talking about sustainability, frame it as **reducing dependence on imports, lowering costs, and maximizing efficiency**—which leads to the same climate-positive outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Plan (Keeping Climate in the Background)**\n1. **Adjust Slide Language**: Use words like **\"efficiency,\" \"resilience,\" \"cost-saving,\" \"adaptation,\" and \"long-term stability\"** instead of \"climate change\" or \"sustainability.\"\n2. **Modify Activities**: Introduce **constraints related to resource availability, supply chain risks, and economic efficiency** instead of explicitly saying “environmental” concerns.\n3. **Provide Strategic Worksheets**:  \n   - Adaptive Business Strategy Worksheet: Helps them think about risks **broadly** while letting climate factors emerge naturally.  \n   - Local Efficiency Challenge: Focuses on **cost-effective resource use** rather than \"eco-friendliness.\"\n4. **Use Practical Case Studies**: Highlight successful Iraqi/KRI businesses that **saved money and improved resilience** by being resource-efficient.\n5. **Facilitator Training**: Instruct trainers to **ask about resilience, adaptability, and efficiency**—not directly about \"climate change\"—allowing participants to **discover** those connections themselves.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Why This Approach Works**\n- **Avoids Resistance**: Climate-related discussions can sometimes feel political or external to business concerns. Framing around resilience and efficiency makes the changes feel immediately relevant.\n- **Aligns with Market Pressures**: Iraqi/KRI entrepreneurs already struggle with **energy costs, unstable supply chains, and economic uncertainty**—this method **frames climate solutions as business advantages** rather than moral imperatives.\n- **Encourages Self-Discovery**: Instead of imposing sustainability ideas, this structure **lets participants identify climate-linked risks themselves**, making the insights more impactful.\n\nWould you like a full **facilitator script** on how to guide these interventions smoothly?",
