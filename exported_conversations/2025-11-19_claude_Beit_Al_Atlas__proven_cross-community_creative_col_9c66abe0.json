  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user asked Claude to help condense and edit content for their Beit Al Atlas artist residency program in Beirut. Initially, they requested a dramatic compression of their \"Track Record\" section from over 1,000 characters down to approximately 200 characters. Claude provided a condensed version but noted the significant information loss and suggested the limit was too restrictive for meaningful content.\n\nThe user then shifted direction, asking Claude to rewrite the entire document in their voice while expanding it to about 4,000 characters with spaces. Claude rewrote the content but the user identified several issues: the result was too short (around 3,700 characters), used too many em dashes, and sounded artificial. The user specifically requested the text sound more like the original and avoid AI writing patterns, referencing an attached document about AI writing tells.\n\nThe user demonstrates a preference for direct, authentic communication and is sensitive to artificial-sounding language. They work on Beit Al Atlas, a decade-old initiative that brings together diverse communities in Beirut through shared living experiences. The program involves partnerships with organizations like Sitt Naila and Barzakh, and has previously hosted artists like writer Zeyn Joukhadar and collaborated with Fearless Collective on community murals. The user values concrete, grounded language over flowery or promotional tone, and wants their writing to reflect genuine human experience rather than formal grant proposal language. They provided specific feedback about avoiding em dashes and maintaining the original document's more narrative, personal style while hitting precise character count targets.",

            "extracted_content": "The Three Threads\nBeit-al-Atlas began with two threads woven together: Bilal's connections to the West and global creative communities, and Saleh's deep roots in Syria and Lebanon's refugee population. For a decade, this east-meets-west dynamic has created a space where unlikely friendships form across borders and backgrounds and beauty, growth and contribution unfold naturally.\nThis residency weaves in a third thread: intentional artistic practice connects to the reality of building an unlikely home and connecting to the beauty people see and create together. The artists living with the other house-mates will be able to witness and document what emerges when difference meets. We are creating a dedicated space for artists to sit with place, sense into the rhythms of Beirut, and create artifacts that tell the story of these encounters over time.\nSeasonal Residencies: Marking Time by the Turn of Seasons\nWe structure residencies around seasonal transitions—the moments when spring shifts to summer, fall deepens into winter, when light and land are in flux. These generative turning points invite reflection and connection to place.\nWhen someone asks, \"How long were you in Beirut?\", the answer isn't \"two months\"—it's \"I was there for the spring.\" This seasonal framing connects residents to the actual rhythms of the land, the Mediterranean climate, the mountains that Saleh, our cofounder and lead organizer of the cooperative home as well as the residency, will guide them through, and the lived experience of Lebanese communities whose relationship to place is inseparable from seasonal cycles.\nEach of our 6 artists will spend approximately one season (2-3 months) embedded in Beit-al-Atlas and Beirut's diverse neighborhoods over a 24-month period.\nHome-Based Residency: Not Tourists or Isolated Studios\nThis is not a studio-based residency where artists work in isolation. Residents live in our home in Hamra, sharing meals, joining evening conversations, participating in the daily life of a household designed to bridge communities that usually exist side by side without usually meeting.\nIn Lebanon, there is a large expat community, people who work for NGOs, attend international schools, frequent museums and restaurants and sometimes peoplewho might spend years in Beirut without ever sitting down for dinner with someone from Burj al-Barajneh or Shatila. Similarly, many local Lebanese and Syrian communities rarely engage with international visitors beyond transactional encounters.\nBeit-al-Atlas is different. For a decade, we have created a home where these communities meet not as aid workers and beneficiaries, not as tourists and locals, but as housemates, friends, co-creators and usually over food, music, art and dance. Shared meals, conversations, and experiences at Beit Al Atlas consistently bear witness that the deepest, most lasting connections to places and communities come through immersion into a welcoming home. Beit Al Atlas becomes the soil from which life-long connections grow. \n\nArtists as Teachers: Sharing Skills Across Communities\nA core requirement of each residency is that artists teach their craft and share knowledge with Beirut's communities—especially with emerging artists from under-resourced neighborhoods who may lack access to formal art education, international networks, or well-funded cultural institutions.\nWe will work with our community partners (Sitt Naila, Barzakh, and connections in areas like Burj al-Barajneh and Shatila) to host workshops in multiple neighborhoods, create space for skill-sharing between international artists and local practitioners, ensure programming is accessible (free, bilingual, welcoming to all experience levels), and build capacity for emerging artists to develop their own practices. This is not charity—when a calligrapher from Turkey meets a young poet from Burj al-Barajneh, both sides teach and both sides learn.\nTrack Record\nBeit Al Atlas artist residency already has proof of concept;previous artist residencies include the writer Zeyn Joukhadar (author of The Map of Salt and Stars) who led writing workshops with people across different Beirut neighborhoods, bringing together participants from both well-resourced areas and under-resourced communities. Together, they created a bilingual newspaper/zine featuring poetry, rap, drawings, and multimedia work from local artists like Nimir, demonstrating our capacity to facilitate cross-community creative collaboration and produce tangible artifacts.\nWe partnered twice with Fearless Collective, an South-Asia based feminist art collective founded by Shilo Shiv Suleman, to create murals in Beirut. These collaborations brought together 30+ participants from Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Indian, Pakistani, Armenian, Turkish and other backgrounds to create public art. One mural, \"I Hear Your Silence\" in Sassine Square, honors the LGBTQ+ community where two men were attacked in 2009.\nEach residency will include opportunities to connect with Lebanon's landscape through guided mountain walks led by Saleh, exploring how seasonal shifts affect land, light, and daily life, understanding Beirut not just as an urban center but as part of a broader ecosystem.\n\n"

For ten years, this has worked. Unlikely friendships form. People who wouldn't normally meet end up cooking together, arguing about politics, sharing music.\n\nThis residency adds a third thread: artists who can witness and document what happens when people from different worlds actually live together. Not visit. Not volunteer. Live. The artists won't be isolated in studios—they'll be housemates, watching and participating as this experiment in cross-community home-building continues.\n\n**Why Seasons**\n\nWe frame residencies around seasonal transitions—spring turning to summer, fall deepening into winter. These aren't arbitrary time markers. When someone asks \"How long were you in Beirut?\", answering \"I was there for the spring\" connects you to the actual rhythms of the place: the Mediterranean climate, the mountains Saleh will guide you through, the way Lebanese communities relate to their land.\n\nEach of our 6 artists spends roughly one season (2-3 months) in Beit-al-Atlas over 24 months.\n\n**Home, Not Hotel**\n\nThis isn't a studio residency. You're not here to work in isolation. You live in our home in Hamra, share meals, join evening conversations, participate in the daily chaos and beauty of a household that deliberately brings together people who usually exist side-by-side without actually meeting.\n\nLebanon has a large expat community—NGO workers, international school teachers, people who frequent museums and restaurants. Some spend years in Beirut without ever sitting down for dinner with someone from Burj al-Barajneh or Shatila.

When a calligrapher from Istanbul meets a young poet from Burj al-Barajneh, both teach and both learn.\n\n**Track Record**\n\nWe've done this before. Writer Zeyn Joukhadar (The Map of Salt and Stars) led workshops across Beirut neighborhoods, bringing together participants from well-resourced and under-resourced areas. They created a bilingual zine with poetry, rap, drawings, and multimedia work from local artists like Nimir.\n\nWe partnered twice with Fearless Collective (a South Asian feminist art collective founded by Shilo Shiv Suleman) on Beirut murals. These brought together 30+ participants from Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Indian, Pakistani, Armenian, Turkish backgrounds to create public art.

When someone asks \"How long were you in Beirut?\", answering \"I was there for the spring\" connects you to the actual rhythms of the place: the Mediterranean climate, the mountains Saleh will guide you through, the way Lebanese communities relate to their land.\n\nEach of our 6 artists spends roughly one season (2-3 months) in Beit-al-Atlas over 24 months.\n\n**Home, Not Hotel**\n\nThis isn't a studio residency. You're not here to work in isolation. You live in our home in Hamra, share meals, join evening conversations, participate in the daily chaos and beauty of a household that deliberately brings together people who usually exist side-by-side without actually meeting.\n\nLebanon has a large expat community—NGO workers, international school teachers, people who frequent museums and restaurants. Some spend years in Beirut without ever sitting down for dinner with someone from Burj al-Barajneh or Shatila. Meanwhile, many Lebanese and Syrian communities rarely engage with international visitors beyond transactions.\n\nBeit-al-Atlas is different. For a decade, we've built a home where these worlds meet—not as aid workers and beneficiaries, not as tourists and locals, but as housemates. We've learned that the deepest connections to places and communities come through immersion in a welcoming home. The relationships that form here last decades.\n\n**Artists as Teachers**\n\nEach resident teaches their craft to Beirut's communities, especially emerging artists from under-resourced neighborhoods who lack access to formal art education or international networks.\n\nWe work with community partners (Sitt Naila, Barzakh, connections in Burj al-Barajneh and Shatila) to host workshops across neighborhoods, create space for skill-sharing between international and local artists, and keep everything accessible—free, bilingual, welcoming regardless of experience level.\n\nThis isn't charity. When a calligrapher from Istanbul meets a young poet from Burj al-Barajneh, both teach and both learn.\n\n**Track Record**\n\nWe've done this before. Writer Zeyn Joukhadar (The Map of Salt and Stars) led workshops across Beirut neighborhoods, bringing together participants from well-resourced and under-resourced areas. They created a bilingual zine with poetry, rap, drawings, and multimedia work from local artists like Nimir.\n\nWe partnered twice with Fearless Collective (a South Asian feminist art collective founded by Shilo Shiv Suleman) on Beirut murals. These brought together 30+ participants from Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Indian, Pakistani, Armenian, Turkish backgrounds to create public art. One mural in Sassine Square, \"I Hear Your Silence,\" honors the LGBTQ+ community where two men were attacked in 2009.\n\nEach residency includes mountain walks with Saleh, connecting to Lebanon's landscape and understanding Beirut not just as an urban center but as part of a broader ecosystem shaped by seasonal shifts.\n\n---\n\n**(3,998 characters with spaces)**",

Whether powered by a rotary engine, a V8 swap, or an imagined fighter jet turbine, the Miata remains the canvas for car enthusiasts worldwide.\"\nLLMs tend to have an identifiable writing style.\nThis is a list of writing and formatting conventions typical of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, with real examples taken from Wikipedia articles and drafts. It is a field guide to help detect undisclosed AI-generated content on Wikipedia. This list is descriptive, not prescriptive; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the policies and guidelines and the Manual of Style, but does not belong on this page.\n\nThis list is not a ban on certain words, phrases, or punctuation. Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated, as the large language models that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of very common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, specific to Wikipedia. While some of its advice may be broadly applicable, some signs—particularly those involving punctuation and formatting—may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.\n\nThe patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor wordsmithing, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry much more serious policy risks. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently), those surface defects might not be present, but deeper problems can be. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content and Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide.\n\nThe speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which can be found in § Communication intended for the user and the other two in § Citations. The other signs are not sufficient on their own for speedy deletion.\n\nDo not solely rely on artificial intelligence content detection tools (such as GPTZero) to evaluate whether text is LLM-generated. While they perform better than random chance, these tools have nontrivial error rates and cannot replace human judgment.[1] Detectors can be brittle to multiple factors such as text modifications (e.g. paraphrasing and spacing changes) and the use of generative models not seen during detector training.[2]\n\nContent\nShortcuts\nWP:AIWTW\nWP:AI-ISM\nWP:LLMISM\nLLMs (and artificial neural networks in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to regress to the mean; that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a \"tell\" for detecting AI-generated content.\n\nFor example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. Consequently, the LLM tends to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the specific detail \"invented the first train-coupling device\" might become \"a revolutionary titan of industry.\" It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.[3]\n\nThis statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements, that could equally apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.\n\nUndue emphasis on symbolism, legacy, and importance\nWords to watch: stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, plays a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal role, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting impact, key turning point, indelible mark, deeply rooted, profound heritage, steadfast dedication, ...\nLLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects of the topic represent or contribute to a broader topic.[4] There is a distinct and easily identifiable repertoire of ways that it writes these statements.[5]\n\nThe Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. [...]\n\nThe founding of Idescat represented a significant shift toward regional statistical independence, enabling Catalonia to develop a statistical system tailored to its unique socio-economic context. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.\n— From this revision to Statistical Institute of Catalonia\nKumba has long been an important center for trade and agriculture. [...] The establishment of road networks connecting Kumba to other parts of the Southwest Region, such as Mamfe and Buea, helped solidify its role as a regional hub.\n— From this revision to Kumba, Cameroon\nLLMs may include these statements for even the most mundane of subjects like etymology or population data. Sometimes, they add hedging preambles acknowledging that the subject is relatively unimportant or low-profile, before talking about its importance anyway.\n\nExamples\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, the name Bakunutan was hispanized to Bacnotan, a modification reflected in official documents preserved in the National Archives in Manila. This etymology highlights the enduring legacy of the community's resistance and the transformative power of unity in shaping its identity.\n— From this revision to Bacnotan\nThough it saw only limited application, it contributes to the broader history of early aviation engineering and reflects the influence of French rotary designs on German manufacturers.\n— From Draft:Goebel Goe II\nWhen talking about biology (e.g., when asked to discuss a given animal or plant species), LLMs tend to over-emphasize species' connections to the ecosystem or environment in general, and may strain to derive such symbolism from things like taxonomy. LLMs also tend to put too much emphasis on the species' conservation status and the efforts to protect it, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist, and editorialize about the importance of future research on a topic.\n\nExamples\n\nIt plays a role in the ecosystem and contributes to Hawaii's rich cultural heritage. [...] Preserving this endemic species is vital not only for ecological diversity but also for sustaining the cultural traditions connected to Hawaii’s native flora.\n— From this revision to Nototrichium divaricatum\nCurrently, there is no specific conservation assessment for Lethrinops lethrinus by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the general health of the Lake Malawi ecosystem is crucial for the survival of this and other endemic species. Factors such as overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction could potentially impact their populations.\n— From this revision to Lethrinops lethrinus\nUndue emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage\nWords to watch: independent coverage, local/regional/national/[country name] media outlets, music/business/tech outlets\nSimilarly, LLMs act as if the best way to prove that a subject is notable is to hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often by listing sources that a subject has been covered in. They may or may not provide additional context as to what those sources have actually said about the subject, and often inaccurately attribute their own superficial analyses to the source.\n\nHuman-written press releases have of course also cited news clippings for decades, but LLMs specifically asked to write a Wikipedia article often echo the exact verbiage of Wikipedia's guidelines, such as \"independent coverage.\"\n\nExamples\n\nShe spoke about AI on CNN, and was featured in Vogue, Wired, Toronto Star, and other media. [...] Her insights have also been featured in *Wired*, *Refinery29*, and other prominent media outlets.\n— From this revision to Sinead Bovell\nHer views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu.\n— From this revision to Shamika Ravi\nIts significance is documented in archived school event programs and regional press coverage, including the *Mesabi Daily News*, which regularly reviewed performances held there.\n— From this revision to Virginia High School (Minnesota)\nOn Wikipedia specifically, LLMs often painstakingly emphasize their sources in the body text—even for trivial coverage, uncontroversial facts, or other situations where a human Wikipedia editor would be more likely to either provide an inline citation or no source at all.\n\nExamples\n\nIn December 2022, The Telegraph referenced Alternative Airlines in a feature on the cheapest days to fly.\n— Trivial coverage with attribution, from Draft:Alternative Airlines\nAccording to filings at Companies House, the company reported annual revenue of £75.2 million in 2023 and £83 million in 2024.\n— Attribution of uncontroversial information, from Draft:Alternative Airlines\nIn articles about people/entities who use social media, LLMs will often note that they \"maintain an active social media presence\" or something similar. This wording is particularly idiosyncratic to AI text and relatively uncommon on Wikipedia before ~2024.\n\nThe mall maintains a strong digital presence, particularly on Instagram, where it actively shares the latest updates and events. Forum Kochi has consistently demonstrated excellence in digital promotions, with high-quality, engaging, and impactful video content playing a key role in its outreach.\n— From this revision to Forum Mall Kochi\nSuperficial analyses\nShortcut\nWP:SUPERFICIAL\nWords to watch: ensuring ..., highlighting ..., emphasizing ..., reflecting ..., underscoring ..., showcasing ..., aligns with..., contributing to...\nAI chatbots tend to insert superficial analysis of information, often in relation to its significance, recognition, or impact. This is often done by attaching a present participle (\"-ing\") phrase at the end of sentences, sometimes with vague attributions to third parties (see below).[4]\n\nWhile many of these words are strong AI tells on their own,[5][6] an even stronger tell is when the subjects of these verbs are facts, events, or other inanimate things. A person, for example, can highlight or emphasize something, but a fact or event cannot. The \"highlighting\" or \"underscoring\" is not something that is actually happening; it is a claim by a disembodied narrator about what something means.[4]\n\nSuch comments are usually synthesis and/or unattributed opinions in wikivoice. Newer chatbots with retrieval-augmented generation (for example, an AI chatbot that can search the web) may attach these statements to named sources—e.g., \"Roger Ebert highlighted the lasting influence\"—regardless of whether those sources say anything close.\n\nExamples\n\nDouera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a dynamic hub of activity and culture.\n— From this revision to Douéra\nThe civil rights movement emerged as a powerful continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice.\n— From this revision to African-American culture\nIts bilingual monument sign, with inscriptions in both English and Spanish, underscores its role in bringing together Latter-day Saints from the United States and Mexico.\n— From this revision to McAllen Texas Temple\nThese citations, spanning more than six decades and appearing in recognized academic publications, illustrate Blois' lasting influence in computational linguistics, grammar, and neology.\n— From an old version of Draft:Jacques Blois (linguist)\nPromotional and advertisement-like language\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Puffery.\nShortcuts\nWP:AIPUFFERY\nWP:AIPEACOCK\nWords to watch: continues to captivate, groundbreaking (in the figurative sense), stunning natural beauty, enduring/lasting legacy, nestled, in the heart of, boasts a  ...\nLLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially when writing about something that could be considered \"cultural heritage\"—in which case they constantly remind the reader of its importance.\n\nExamples\n\nNestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and a significant place within the Amhara region. From its scenic landscapes to its historical landmarks, Alamata Raya Kobo offers visitors a fascinating glimpse into the diverse tapestry of Ethiopia. In this article, we will explore the unique characteristics that make Alamata Raya Kobo a town worth visiting and shed light on its significance within the Amhara region.\n— From this revision to Alamata (woreda); this text also includes a false range\nTTDC acts as the gateway to Tamil Nadu’s diverse attractions, seamlessly connecting the beginning and end of every traveller's journey. It offers dependable, value-driven experiences that showcase the state’s rich history, spiritual heritage, and natural beauty.\n— From this revision to Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation\nIn a similar way, LLM chatbots also add promotional/positive-sounding language to text about companies, business, and products, such that it sounds more like the transcript of a TV commercial.\n\nIn general, AEO focuses on improving data consistency and machine readability so that information can be accurately understood by emerging “answer engines.” Commonly discussed practices include using structured data formats such as JSON-LD and schema.org, maintaining the freshness and accuracy of published information, and aligning digital entities with open web standards like Wikidata and Schema.org.\n— From Draft:Answer Engine Optimization\nEMG has received positive feedback from the music community for its artist-centric approach. Industry resource Buzzsonic highlighted EMG's comprehensive services and commitment to supporting independent artists. Additionally, the company's official website outlines its mission and services, reflecting its dedication to reshaping the music distribution landscape.\n— From Draft:Extrinsic Music Group\nThe SOLLEI’s exterior design communicates a powerful emotional presence, staying true to Cadillac's signature bold proportions. Its low, elongated silhouette is highlighted by a wide stance and an extended coupe door, which enhances accessibility to the spacious rear cabin. Smooth, uninterrupted surfaces and a pronounced A-line accentuate the vehicle’s overall length, while a sleek, low tail imparts a sense of refined dynamism. A mid-body line runs seamlessly from the headlamps to the taillights, reinforcing the car’s cohesive and elegant design. Traditional door handles have been replaced with discrete buttons, preserving the vehicle’s clean and modern profile. In a nod to Cadillac’s legacy of bold color choices, the exterior is finished in \"Manila Cream\"—a distinctive hue originally offered in 1957 and 1958. This heritage color has been thoughtfully revived and hand-painted by Cadillac artisans, showcasing the brand’s dedication to craftsmanship and historical reverence.\n— From this revision to Cadillac Sollei\nDidactic, editorializing disclaimers\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Editorializing.\nWords to watch: it's important/critical/crucial to note/remember/consider, may vary...\nLLMs often tell the reader about things \"it's important to remember.\" This frequently takes the form of \"disclaimers\" to an imagined reader regarding safety or controversial topics, or disambiguating topics that vary in different locales/jurisdictions.\n\nExamples\n\nThe emergence of these informal groups reflects a growing recognition of the interconnected nature of urban issues and the potential for ANCs to play a role in shaping citywide policies. However, it's important to note that these caucuses operate outside the formal ANC structure and their influence on policy decisions may vary.\n— From this revision to Advisory Neighborhood Commission\nIt is crucial to differentiate the independent AI research company based in Yerevan, Armenia, which is the subject of this report, from these unrelated organizations to prevent confusion.\n— From Draft:Robi Labs\nIt's important to remember that what's free in one country might not be free in another, so always check before you use something.\n— From Wikimedia's LLM-generated Simple Summary of Public domain\nSection summaries\nShortcuts\nWP:CONCLUSION\nWP:INCONCLUSION\nWords to watch: In summary, In conclusion, Overall ...\nWhen generating longer outputs (such as when told to \"write an article\"), LLMs often add a section titled \"Conclusion\" or similar, and will often end a paragraph or section by summarizing and restating its core idea.[7]\n\nExamples\n\nIn summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research. This structured pathway ensures that nurse scientists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of nursing science.\n— From this revision in Nurse scientist\nOutline-like conclusions about challenges and future prospects\nWords to watch: Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook ...\nMany LLM-generated Wikipedia articles include a \"Challenges\" section, which typically begins with a sentence like \"Despite its [positive/promotional words], [article subject] faces challenges...\" and ends with either a vaguely positive assessment of the article subject,[1] or speculation about how ongoing or potential initiatives could benefit the subject. Such paragraphs usually appear at the end of articles with a rigid outline structure, which may also include a separate section for \"Future Prospects.\"\n\nNote: This sign is about the rigid formula, not simply the mention of challenges or challenging.\n\nExamples\n\nDespite its industrial and residential prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including[...] With its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive as an integral part of the Ambattur industrial zone, embodying the synergy between industry and residential living.\n— From this revision to Korattur\nDespite its success, the Panama Canal faces challenges, including[...] Future investments in technology, such as automated navigation systems, and potential further expansions could enhance the canal’s efficiency and maintain its relevance in global trade.\n— From this revision to Panama Canal\nDespite their promising applications, pyroelectric materials face several challenges that must be addressed for broader adoption. One key limitation is[...] Despite these challenges, the versatility of pyroelectric materials positions them as critical components for sustainable energy solutions and next-generation sensor technologies.\n— From this revision to Pyroelectricity\nThe future of hydrocarbon economies faces several challenges, including[...] This section would speculate on potential developments and the changing landscape of global energy.\n— From this revision to Hydrocarbon economy\nOperating in the current Afghan media environment presents numerous challenges, including[...] Despite these challenges, Amu TV has managed to continue to provide a vital service to the Afghan population​​.\n— From this revision to Amu Television\nFor example, while the methodology supports transdisciplinary collaboration in principle, applying it effectively in large, heterogeneous teams can be challenging. [...] SCE continues to evolve in response to these challenges.\n— From this revision to Draft:Socio-cognitive engineering\nLeads treating Wikipedia lists or broad article titles as proper nouns\nIn AI-generated articles about topics with a title that is not a proper name, such as a list, the first sentence of the lead may introduce and/or define the article's title as if it were a standalone real-world entity. While the MOS does allow such titles to be included at the beginning of the lead \"in a natural way\"; these AI leads tend not to be so natural.\n\nExamples\n\n\"The Effects of Foreign language anxiety on Learning\" refers to the feelings of tension, nervousness, and apprehension experienced when learning or using a language other than one’s native tongue.\n— From this revision to Draft:The Effects of Foreign Language Anxiety on Learning\nEuroGames editions is the chronological list of the biennial EuroGames, a European LGBT+ multi-sport event organized by the European Gay and Lesbian Sport Federation (EGLSF).\n— From this revision to EuroGames editions\nThe “List of songs about Mexico” is a curated compilation of musical works that reference Mexico its culture, geography, or identity as a central theme.\n— From this revision to List of songs about Mexico\nLanguage and grammar\nOverused \"AI vocabulary\" words\nShortcuts\nWP:AIVOCAB\nWP:AIWORDS\nWords to watch: align/aligns/aligning with,[5][6] crucial,[1] delve/delves/delving (pre-2025),[5][6][1] emphasizing,[5][6] enduring,[6] enhance/enhances/enhancing,[6][1] fostering,[6][1] garnered/garnering,[5][6] highlight/highlighted/highlighting/highlights (as a verb),[1] interplay,[6] intricate/intricacies,[5][6] pivotal,[6][1] showcase/showcased/showcases/showcasing,[5][6] tapestry (as an abstract noun),[1] testament,[1] underscore/underscored/underscores/underscoring[5][6][1]\nMany studies have demonstrated that LLMs overuse certain words – especially compared to pre-2022 text, which is almost certain to be human-written.[5] These \"AI vocabulary\" words are also ubiquitous in AI-generated encyclopedias, such as Grokipedia, and in AI-generated Wikipedia text. They often co-occur in LLM output: where there is one, there are likely others.[8] An edit introducing one or two of these words may not be a big deal, but an edit (post-2022) introducing lots of them, lots of times, is one of the strongest tells for AI use.\n\nThe distribution of \"AI vocabulary\" is slightly different depending on which chatbot or LLM was used, and has changed over time. For instance, the word delve was famously overused by ChatGPT until 2025, when its incidence dropped off sharply.[9]\n\nPlease keep context in mind. For example, while the word \"underscore\" is overused in AI text, it can also refer to a literal underline mark, or to incidental music.\n\nExamples\n\nSomali cuisine is an intricate and diverse fusion of a multitude of culinary influences, drawing from the rich tapestry of Arab, Indian, and Italian flavours. This culinary tapestry is a direct result of Somalia's longstanding heritage of vibrant trade and bustling commerce. [...] Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali culinary tradition is the incorporation of camel meat and milk. They are considered a delicacy and serve as cherished and fundamental elements in the rich tapestry of Somali cuisine. [...] An enduring testament to the influence of Italian colonial rule in Somalia is the widespread adoption of pasta and lasagne in the local culinary landscape, espicially in the south, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet alongside rice. [...] Additionally, Somali merchants played a pivotal role in the global coffee trade, being one of the first to export coffee beans.\n— From this revision to Somali people\nNegative parallelisms\nShortcut\nWP:AIPARALLEL\nParallel constructions involving \"not\", \"but\", or \"however\" such as \"Not only ... but ...\" or \"It is not just about ..., it's ...\" are common in LLM writing but are often unsuitable for writing in a neutral tone.[1][9]\n\nExamples\n\nSelf-Portrait by Yayoi Kusama, executed in 2010 and currently preserved in the famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence, constitutes not only a work of self-representation, but a visual document of her obsessions, visual strategies and psychobiographical narratives.\n— From this revision to Self-portrait (Yayoi Kusama)\nIt’s not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it’s part of the aggression and atmosphere.\n— From this revision to Draft:Critikal! The Rapper\nHere is an example of a negative parallelism across multiple sentences:\n\nHe hailed from the esteemed Duse family, renowned for their theatrical legacy. Eugenio's life, however, took a path that intertwined both personal ambition and familial complexities.\n— From this revision to Eugenio Duse\nOutlines of negatives\nOn rare occasions, user messages that appear AI-generated may also include short sentences describing items that are either absent from something else or would be considered useless in comparison to a previous, useful item. Some of these may read something along the lines of \"no ..., no ..., just ...\" or \"What matters is ..., not ..., not ...\".\n\nExamples\n\nThere are no long-form profiles. No editorial insights. No coverage of her game dev career. No notable accolades. Just TikTok recaps and callouts.\n\nThe process demands rigor — not emotional fatigue, not personal offense, and certainly not a premature exit masked as moral high ground.\n\nNot a career, not a body of work, not sustained relevance — just an algorithmic moment.\n\nThis page should be gone, fully, cleanly, and without delay. No redirect. No merge. Just delete.\n\nWikipedia’s general notability guideline (WP:GNG) is crystal clear: significant coverage in reliable, independent, secondary sources. Not a few throwaway articles echoing Twitter drama. Not reactionary posts exploiting culture war tension. Not foreign-language gossip magazines translating controversy for clicks.\n\nWhat actually matters — and what continues to be completely absent — is significant, in-depth coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources. Not gossip sites. Not recycled outrage. Not tabloid blurbs about one viral controversy. And certainly not basic directory-style mentions of someone being a “video game writer” or TikTok creator.\n— From Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lilly Contino\nRule of three\nShortcut\nWP:RO3\nLLMs overuse the 'rule of three'. This can take different forms, from \"adjective, adjective, adjective\" to \"short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase\".[1] LLMs often use this structure to make superficial analyses appear more comprehensive.\n\nExamples\n\nThe Amaze Conference brings together global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers to discuss the latest trends in digital marketing. The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities.\n— From Draft:Amaze Conference\nVague attributions of opinion\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Unsupported attributions.\nShortcut\nWP:AIWEASEL\nWords to watch: Industry reports, Observers have cited, Some critics argue ...\nAI chatbots tend to attribute opinions or claims to some vague authority—a practice called weasel wording—while citing only one or two sources that may or may not actually express such view. They also tend to overgeneralize the perspective of one or few sources into that of a wider group.\n\nExamples\n\nHere, the weasel wording implies the opinion comes from an independent source, but it actually cites Nick Ford's own website.\n\nHis [Nick Ford's] compositions have been described as exploring conceptual themes and bridging the gaps between artistic media.\n— From Draft:Nick Ford (musician)\nDue to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Efforts are ongoing to monitor its ecological health and preserve the surrounding grassland environment, which is part of a larger initiative to protect China’s semi-arid ecosystems from degradation.\n— From this revision to Haolai River\nElegant variation\nFor a non-AI-specific style essay about this, see Wikipedia:The problem with elegant variation.\nShortcut\nWP:AIELEVAR\nGenerative AI has a repetition-penalty code, meant to discourage it from reusing words too often.[4] For instance, the output might give a main character's name and then repeatedly use a different synonym or related term (e.g., protagonist, key player, eponymous character) when mentioning it again.\n\nNote: If a user adds multiple pieces of AI-generated content in separate edits, this tell may not apply, as each piece of text may have been generated in isolation.\n\nExamples\n\n  Soviet artistic constraints\n  Non-conformist artists\n  Their creativity\nVierny, after a visit in Moscow in the early 1970’s, committed to supporting artists resisting the constraints of socialist realism and discovered Yankilevskly, among others such as Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov. In the challenging climate of Soviet artistic constraints, Yankilevsky, alongside other non-conformist artists, faced obstacles in expressing their creativity freely. Dina Vierny, recognizing the immense talent and the struggle these artists endured, played a pivotal role in aiding their artistic aspirations. [...]\n\nIn this new chapter of his life, Yankilevsky found himself amidst a community of like-minded artists who, despite diverse styles, shared a common goal—to break free from the confines of state-imposed artistic norms, particularly socialist realism. [...]\n\nThe move to Paris facilitated an environment where Yankilevsky could further explore and exhibit his distinctive artistic vision without the constraints imposed by the Soviet regime. Dina Vierny's unwavering support and commitment to the Russian avant-garde artists played a crucial role in fostering a space where their creativity could flourish, contributing to the rich tapestry of artistic expression in the vibrant cultural landscape of Paris. Vierny's commitment culminated in the groundbreaking exhibition \"Russian Avant-Garde - Moscow 1973\" at her Saint-Germain-des-Prés gallery, showcasing the diverse yet united front of non-conformist artists challenging the artistic norms of their time.\n— From this revision to Vladimir Yankilevsky\nFalse ranges\nShortcuts\nWP:FROMXTOY\nWP:FALSERANGE\nWhen from ... to ... constructions are not used figuratively, they are used to indicate the lower and upper bounds of a scale. The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range (e.g. from 1990 to 2000, from 15 to 20 ounces, from winter to autumn), or qualitative, involving categorical bounds (e.g. \"from seed to tree\", \"from mild to severe\", \"from white belt to black belt\"). The same constructions may be used to form a merism—a figure of speech that combines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative meaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable scale: from head to toe (the length of a body denoting the whole body), from soup to nuts (clearly based on time), etc. This is not a false range.\n\nLLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply mentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be identified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another scale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a false range. LLMs often employ \"figurative\" (often simply: meaningless) \"from ... to ...\" constructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or even unrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred. LLMs do this because such meaningless language is used in persuasive writing to impress and woo, and LLMs are heavily influenced by examples of persuasive writing during their training.\n\nExample\n\nOur journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars that forge the elements of life, to the enigmatic dance of dark matter and dark energy that shape its destiny.\n\n[...] Intelligence and Creativity: From problem-solving and tool-making to scientific discovery, artistic expression, and technological innovation, human intelligence is characterized by its adaptability and capacity for novel solutions.

Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as 1.) instead of standard wikitext.

LLMs especially tend to use em dashes in a formulaic, pat way, often mimicking \"punched up\" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms.\n\nThis sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself.\n\nExamples\n\nElwandore is a virtual micronation for people with passion and skill — a place to build, to create, and to help each other grow while chasing wealth.

In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’), the same character as the curly right single quotation mark, instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in contractions and possessive forms. They may also do this inconsistently.\n\nCurly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. Microsoft Word as well as macOS and iOS devices have a \"smart quotes\" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as LanguageTool may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like Citer may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example,\n\nMcClelland, Mac (2017-09-27). \"When 'Not Guilty' Is a Life Sentence\". The New York Times.

It may also pair it with text about what that information \"likely\" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely speculative (including the very claim that it's \"not documented\") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated.\n\nExamples\n\nWhile specific information about the fauna of Studniční hora is limited in the provided search results, the mountain likely supports...\n— From this revision to Studniční hora\nThough the details of these resistance efforts aren't widely documented, they highlight her bravery...\n— From this revision to Throwing Curves: Eva Zeisel\nNo significant public controversies or security incidents affecting Outpost24 have been documented as of June 2025.\n— From Draft:Outpost24\nAs of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about the current status or developments related to the \"Chester Mental Health Center\" in today's era.\n— From this revision to Chester Mental Health Center\nBelow is a detailed overview based on available information:\n— From Draft:The Good, The Bad, The Dollar Menu 2\nPrompt refusal\nWords to watch: as an AI language model, as a large language model, I'm sorry ...\nOccasionally, the AI chatbot declines to answer a prompt as written, usually with an apology and a reminder that it is \"an AI language model\". Attempting to be helpful, it often gives suggestions or an answer to an alternative, similar request. Outright refusals have become increasingly rare.\n\nPrompt refusals are obviously unacceptable for Wikipedia articles, so if a user includes one anyway, it may indicate that they did not review the text and/or may not be proficient in English.

As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running on MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like Miraheze, LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data. While the corpora of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: Markdown. Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using it, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia articles look like formatted documents.\n\nWhen asked about its \"formatting guidelines\", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level instructions typically generates some variation of the following (this is Microsoft Copilot in mid-2025):\n\n## Formatting Guidelines\n\n- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.  \n- Use a single main title (`#`) and clear primary subheadings (`##`).  \n- Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences, ≤150 words).  \n- Break large topics into labeled subsections.  \n- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.  \n- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.  \n- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.  \n- Use horizontal dividers (`---`) between major sections.  \n- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.  \n- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.  \n- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.  \n- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.\nAs the above suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.\n\nEven when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using syntactically correct wikitext, as their training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in Markdown. When told to \"generate an article\", a chatbot typically defaults to using Markdown for the generated output, which is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might \"realize\" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (`wikitext`)?[b] in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax is often rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style fenced code block (its syntax for WP:PRE) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: ```wikitext.[c]\n\nThe presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like Obsidian and GitHub, and on platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Slack. Some writing tools and apps, such as iOS Notes, Google Docs, and Windows Notepad, support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.\n\nExamples\n\nSee also: Markdown § Examples\nI believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** — not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being “unhelpful”, and a general impression that I am \"not here to build an encyclopedia\". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments \"AI-generated\" — without explaining how they are substantively flawed.\n— From this revision to a user talk page\n- The Wikipedia entry does not explicitly mention the \"Cyberhero League\" being recognized as a winner of the World Future Society's BetaLaunch Technology competition, as detailed in the interview with THE FUTURIST ([1](https://consciouscreativity.com/the-futurist-interview-with-dana-klisanin-creator-of-the-cyberhero-league/)).

These will appear as red links. You may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite Category:Entrepreneurs. Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.\n\nPay attention to blue links under see also headers as well. LLM-generated \"see also\" sections often tend to fill them up (to at least three links) seemingly out of obligation. If a new page/draft on some startup links to a broad term like Financial technology in its see-also section, that's a bit suspicious.\n\nOf course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule. New users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections, and returning editors may be used to old categories that have since been deleted.\n\nExamples\n\n[[Category:American hip hop musicians]]\n— From this revision to Draft:Paytra\nrather than\n\n[[Category:American hip-hop musicians]]\nCitations\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Fictitious references.\nShortcut\nWP:AIFICTREF\nBroken external links\nIf a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and several of them are broken (e.g., returning 404 errors), this is a strong sign of an AI-generated page, particularly if the dead links are not found in website archiving sites like Internet Archive or Archive Today. Most links become broken over time, but these factors make it unlikely that the link was ever real.\n\nInvalid DOI and ISBNs\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see Wikipedia:DOI and Wikipedia:ISBN.\nA checksum can be used to verify ISBNs. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates display a warning if so. Similarly, DOIs are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of hallucinated references.\n\nRelated are DOIs that point to entirely unrelated articles and general book citations without pages. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.\n\nOhm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1]. Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are \"ohmic,\" meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors [2][3].\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. ISBN 9780470521571.\n\n2. M. E. Van Valkenburg, “The validity and limitations of Ohm’s law in non-linear circuits,” Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 62, no. 6, pp. 769–770, Jun. 1974. doi:10.1109/PROC.1974.9547\n\n3. C. L. Fortescue, “Ohm’s Law in alternating current circuits,” Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 55, no. 11, pp. 1934–1936, Nov. 1967. doi:10.1109/PROC.1967.6033\nThe book references appear valid – a book on electric circuits would likely have information about Ohm's law – but without the page number, that citation is not useful for verifying the claims in the prose. Worse, both Proceedings of the IEEE citations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to completely different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, C. L. Fortescue was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and Vol 55, Issue 11 does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 3.\n\nIncorrect or unconventional use of references\nShortcut\nWP:AICITESTYLE\nAI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so as Wikipedia expects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.\n\nExamples\n\nFrom this revision to a user sandbox\nIn the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.\n\nIn this case, the Smith, R. J. source – being the \"third source\" the tool presumably generated the link 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3' (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{cite journal}} reference, even though the links resolve.\n\nThe LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.\n\nFor over thirty years, computers have been utilized in the rehabilitation of individuals with brain injuries. Initially, researchers delved into the potential of developing a \"prosthetic memory.\"<ref>Fowler R, Hart J, Sheehan M. A prosthetic memory: an application of the prosthetic environment concept. ''Rehabil Counseling Bull''. 1972;15:80–85.</ref> However, by the early 1980s, the focus shifted towards addressing brain dysfunction through repetitive practice.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=R.

Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited, and further responses require the user to select \"continue generating\".\n\nThis method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a copyright violation rather than the use of an LLM.\n\nDiscrepancies in writing style and variety of English\nA sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools.\n\nAnother discrepancy is a mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[7] Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.\n\nAge of text relative to ChatGPT launch\nChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not easily accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.\n\nIt is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia prior to November 30, 2022 was generated by an LLM. If an edit was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some older text may display some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.\n\nOverwhelmingly verbose edit summaries\nAI-generated edit summaries are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without abbreviations, and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.\n\nRefined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with Wikipedia's content guidelines. Removed promotional wording, ensured factual accuracy, and maintained a clear, well-structured presentation. Updated sections on history, coverage, challenges, and recognition for clarity and relevance. Added proper formatting and categorized the entry accordingly\n— Edit summary from this revision to Khaama Press\nI formalized the tone, clarified technical content, ensured neutrality, and indicated citation needs.

At least one LLM tends to insert \"submission statements\" supposedly intended for reviewers that supposedly explain why the subject is notable and why the draft meets Wikipedia guidelines. Of course, all this actually does is let reviewers know that the draft is LLM-generated, and should be declined or speedied without a second thought.\n\nReviewer note (for AfC): This draft is a neutral and well-sourced biography of Portuguese public manager Jorge Patrão. All references are from independent, reliable sources (Público, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Negócios, RTP, O Interior, Agência Lusa) covering his public career and cultural activity. It meets WP:RS and WP:BLP standards and demonstrates clear notability per WP:NBIO through: – Presidency of Serra da Estrela Tourism Region (1998–2013); – Presidency of Parkurbis – Covilhã Science and Technology Park; – Founding role in Rede de Judiarias de Portugal (member of the Council of Europe’s European Routes of Jewish Heritage); – Authorship of the book \"1677 – A Fábrica d’El-Rei\"; – Founder/curator of the Beatriz de Luna Art Collection (Old Master focus). There is also a Portuguese version of this article at pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Patrão. Thank you for your review. -->\n— Found at the top of Draft:Jorge Patrão (all the inevitable formatting errors are present in the original)\nPre-declined AFC review templates\nOccasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an AFC review template already set to \"declined\". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like {{AfC submission|d}}, in which the \"d\" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting {{AfC submission/declined}}. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk or one of the other help pages why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free \"submission declined\" header is a strong indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.\n\nLinks to searches\n\nyou declined your own draft\nIneffective indicators\nFalse accusations of AI use can drive away new editors and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider if Dunning–Kruger effect and confirmation bias is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection—and may even indicate the opposite.\n\nPerfect grammar: While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also § Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English.)\n\"Bland\" or \"robotic\" prose: By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as \"robotic\" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.[12]\n\"Fancy,\" \"academic,\" or unusual words: While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are long and have difficult readability scores, the correlation does not extend to all \"fancy,\" academic, or \"advanced\"-sounding prose.[1] Low-frequency and \"unusual\" words are also less likely to show up in AI-generated writing as they are statistically less common, unless they are proper nouns directly related to the topic.\nShortcut\nWP:AILETTER\nLetter-like writing (in isolation): Although many talk page messages written with salutations, valedictions and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, that is not guaranteed to be the case for all such messages. Letters and emails have conventionally been written in similar ways long before modern LLMs existed. An AI-generated message may start with a subject line, include a vertical list[d] or one or more placeholders, or end abruptly. In addition, some human editors may mistakenly post emails, letters, petitions, or messages intended for the article's subject, frequently formatted as letters.[e] While such edits are generally off-topic and may be removed per the guidelines at WP:NOTFORUM—particularly if they contain personal information—they are not necessarily LLM-generated.\nConjunctions (in isolation): While LLMs tend to overuse connecting words and phrases in a stilted, formulaic way that implies inappropriate synthesis of facts, such uses are typical of essay-like writing by humans and are not strong indicators by themselves.\nBizarre wikitext: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in § Use of Markdown, they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, \"inexplicable\" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in § Markup). Bizarrely placed HTML tags like <span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool (T113137). Misplaced syntax like ''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel. (rendered as \"Catch-22 is a satirical novel.\") are more indicative of mistakes in VisualEditor, where such errors are harder to notice than in source editing."

Not visit. Not volunteer. Live. The artists won't be isolated in studios. They'll be housemates, watching and participating as this experiment in cross-community home-building continues.\n\n**Why Seasons**\n\nWe frame residencies around seasonal transitions. Spring turning to summer, fall deepening into winter. These aren't arbitrary time markers. When someone asks \"How long were you in Beirut?\", answering \"I was there for the spring\" connects you to the actual rhythms of the place: the Mediterranean climate, the mountains Saleh will guide you through, the way Lebanese communities relate to their land.\n\nEach of our 6 artists spends roughly one season (2-3 months) in Beit-al-Atlas over 24 months.\n\n**Home, Not Hotel**\n\nThis isn't a studio residency. You're not here to work in isolation. You live in our home in Hamra, share meals, join evening conversations, participate in the daily chaos and beauty of a household that deliberately brings together people who usually exist side-by-side without actually meeting.\n\nLebanon has a large expat community. NGO workers, international school teachers, people who frequent museums and restaurants. Some spend years in Beirut without ever sitting down for dinner with someone from Burj al-Barajneh or Shatila. Meanwhile, many Lebanese and Syrian communities rarely engage with international visitors beyond transactions.\n\nBeit-al-Atlas is different. For a decade, we've built a home where these worlds meet. Not as aid workers and beneficiaries, not as tourists and locals, but as housemates. The deepest connections to places and communities come through immersion in a welcoming home. The relationships that form here last decades.\n\n**Artists as Teachers**\n\nEach resident teaches their craft to Beirut's communities, especially emerging artists from under-resourced neighborhoods who lack access to formal art education or international networks.\n\nWe work with community partners (Sitt Naila, Barzakh, connections in Burj al-Barajneh and Shatila) to host workshops across neighborhoods. Everything is accessible: free, bilingual, welcoming regardless of experience level.\n\nThis isn't charity. When a calligrapher from Istanbul meets a young poet from Burj al-Barajneh, both teach and both learn.\n\n**Track Record**\n\nWe've done this before. Writer Zeyn Joukhadar (The Map of Salt and Stars) led workshops across Beirut neighborhoods, bringing together participants from well-resourced and under-resourced areas. They created a bilingual zine with poetry, rap, drawings, and multimedia work from local artists like Nimir.\n\nWe partnered twice with Fearless Collective (a South Asian feminist art collective founded by Shilo Shiv Suleman) on Beirut murals. These brought together 30+ participants from Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Indian, Pakistani, Armenian, Turkish backgrounds to create public art. One mural in Sassine Square, \"I Hear Your Silence,\" honors the LGBTQ+ community where two men were attacked in 2009.\n\nEach residency includes mountain walks with Saleh, connecting to Lebanon's landscape and understanding Beirut not just as an urban center but as part of a broader ecosystem shaped by seasonal shifts.\n\n**(3,997 characters with spaces)**",

NGO workers, international school teachers, people who frequent museums and restaurants. Some spend years in Beirut without ever sitting down for dinner with someone from Burj al-Barajneh or Shatila. Meanwhile, many Lebanese and Syrian communities rarely engage with international visitors beyond transactions.\n\nBeit-al-Atlas is different. For a decade, we've built a home where these worlds meet. Not as aid workers and beneficiaries, not as tourists and locals, but as housemates. The deepest connections to places and communities come through immersion in a welcoming home. The relationships that form here last decades.\n\n**Artists as Teachers**\n\nEach resident teaches their craft to Beirut's communities, especially emerging artists from under-resourced neighborhoods who lack access to formal art education or international networks.\n\nWe work with community partners (Sitt Naila, Barzakh, connections in Burj al-Barajneh and Shatila) to host workshops across neighborhoods. Everything is accessible: free, bilingual, welcoming regardless of experience level.\n\nThis isn't charity. When a calligrapher from Istanbul meets a young poet from Burj al-Barajneh, both teach and both learn.\n\n**Track Record**\n\nWe've done this before. Writer Zeyn Joukhadar (The Map of Salt and Stars) led workshops across Beirut neighborhoods, bringing together participants from well-resourced and under-resourced areas. They created a bilingual zine with poetry, rap, drawings, and multimedia work from local artists like Nimir.\n\nWe partnered twice with Fearless Collective (a South Asian feminist art collective founded by Shilo Shiv Suleman) on Beirut murals. These brought together 30+ participants from Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Indian, Pakistani, Armenian, Turkish backgrounds to create public art. One mural in Sassine Square, \"I Hear Your Silence,\" honors the LGBTQ+ community where two men were attacked in 2009.\n\nEach residency includes mountain walks with Saleh, connecting to Lebanon's landscape and understanding Beirut not just as an urban center but as part of a broader ecosystem shaped by seasonal shifts.\n\n**(3,997 characters with spaces)**",
