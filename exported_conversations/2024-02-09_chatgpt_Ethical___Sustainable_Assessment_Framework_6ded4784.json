      "content": "Create a competency-based assessment table aligned with the EU's EntreComp framework for the specified competency 'Ethical & Sustainable Thinking'. The table should visually present five levels of expertise across the top row and include five thematic rows representing different evidence styles at the bottom. Each cell in the table must directly address all threads of the competency and be labeled with both the thread and corresponding evidence.\n\n#### Competency Details:\nETHICAL & SUSTAINABLE THINKING - Assess the consequences and impact of ideas, opportunities, and actions.\nCompetency details and threads:\nETHICAL & SUSTAINABLE THINKING\tAssess the consequences and impact of ideas, opportunities and actions\tAssess the consequences of ideas that bring value and the effect of entrepreneurial action on the target community, the market, society and the environment. Reflect on h w sustainable long-term social, cultural and economic goals are, and the course of action chosen. Act responsibly.\tBEHAVE ETHICALLY\tI can recognise behaviours that show integrity, honesty, responsibility, courage and commitment.\tI can describe in my own words the importance of integrity and ethical values.\tI can apply ethical thinking to consumption and pro- duction processes.\tI am driven by honesty and integrity when taking decisions.\tI can argue that ideas for creating value should be supported by ethics and values relating to gender, equality, fairness, social justice and environmental sustainability.\tI can take responsibility for promoting ethical behaviour in my area of influence, (for example, by promoting gender balance, highlighting inequalities and any lack of integrity).\tI make it my priority to make sure that ethical behaviour is respected and pro- moted in my area of influence\tI take action against unethical behaviour.\n\t\t\tTHINK SUSTAINABLY\tI can list examples of environmentally friendly behaviour that benefits a co - munity.\tI can recognise examples of environmentally friendly behaviour by companies that creates value for society as a whole.\tI can identify practices that are not sustainable and their implications for the environment.\tI can produce a clear problem statement when faced with practices that are not sustainable.\tI can discuss the impact an organisation has on the environment (and vice versa).\tI can discuss the relationship between society and technical developments, relating to their implications for the environment.\tI can choose adequate methods for analysing environmental impact based on their advantages and disadvantages.\tI can contribute to self-regulation discussions within my sector of operations.\n\t\t\tASSESS IMPACT\tI can find and list examples of changes caused by human action in social, cultural, environ- mental or economic contexts.\tI can tell the difference between the impact of a value-creating activity on the target community and the broader impact on society.\tI can identify the impact that taking up opportunities will have on me and my team, on the target group and on the surrounding com- munity.\tI can identify stakeholders who are affected by the change brought about by my (or my team's) value-creating activity, including stakeholders who cannot speak up (for example, future generations, climate or nature).\tI can analyse the implications of my value-creating activity within the boundaries of the system I am working in.\tI can define the purpose of the impact assessment, impact monitoring, and evaluation of impact.\tI can choose ‘measure indica- tors’ to monitor and assess the impact of my value-creating activity.\tI can carry out im- pact assessment, impact monitoring, and impact evaluation on my value-creating activity.\n\t\t\tBE ACCOUNTABLE\t\t\t\tI can tell the difference between accounting for use of resources and accounting for the impact of my value-creating activity on stakeholders and the environment.\tI can tell the difference between input, output, out- comes and impact.\tI can discuss a range of accountability methods for both functional and strategic account- ability.\tI can use the accountability methods that hold me responsible to our internal and external stake- holders.\tI can design ways to be accountable to all of our stake- holders.\n#### Steps:\n1. **Confirm Understanding**: State your interpretation of the competency and its threads. Confirm understanding of the thematic approach and practicality requirements.\n2. **Evidence Generation**: Develop evidence types for each level, adhering to the specified themes. Ensure that each evidence type within a cell corresponds to and is labeled with a specific thread of the competency.\n3. **Practicality Check**: Ensure all evidence types are practical, shareable, and suitable for a digital platform.\n4. **Feedback Request**: After each step, ask for feedback to refine and ensure alignment with requirements.\n\n#### Note: \n- Prioritize clarity, direct alignment with competency threads, and practicality of evidence.\n- Each cell in the table should include evidence for all four threads, labeled accordingly.\n\n#### Creativity Competency Example for Reference: \n[Insert Creativity Competency Table Here]\n\nCreativity Competency\tLevel 1: Inception & Exploration\tLevel 2: Experimentation & Action\tLevel 3: Skill Enhancemen\tLevel 4: Collaboration & Complexity\tLevel 5: Transformation & Innovation\nEvidence for Creativity:\tDocumented Curiosity-Driven Activities (e.g., list of new things tried).\nIdea Generation Records (e.g., basic mind maps, brainstorming notes).\nReflections on New Experiences (e.g., written or video reflections).\nPhotographic or Artistic Representations of new experiences.\nSummary of Informal Research on new topics of interest.\tPrototypes or Models of initial ideas (photos or physical models).\nExperimentation Logs or Records detailing the testing process.\nFeedback Summaries from peers or mentors on prototypes.\nRevision Histories showing how ideas evolved.\nCase Studies or Project Reports of experimental ventures.\tDetailed Problem Statements identifying specific challenges.\nSkill Development Records (e.g., courses taken, skills practiced).\nAdvanced Prototypes or Refined Solutions demonstrating skill application.\nAnalysis Reports showing understanding of problem contexts.\nPresentations or Essays articulating creative solutions.\tTeam Project Summaries or Collaboration Logs.\nComplex Problem Analyses tackled with a team.\nJoint Creative Outputs (e.g., co-designed products or services).\nStakeholder Feedback Reports demonstrating collaborative impact.\nLeadership or Coordination Roles taken in collaborative projects.\tStrategic Plans or Roadmaps for innovative projects.\nImpact Assessments or Evaluations of project outcomes.\nInnovation Portfolios showcasing a range of creative projects.\nResearch Papers or Articles on transformative ideas or methods.\nTestimonials or Recognitions highlighting innovation leadership.\n\nAfter developing the table, seek feedback for adjustments, focusing on the coverage of all threads in each level and the practicality of the evidence.\"\n\n",
