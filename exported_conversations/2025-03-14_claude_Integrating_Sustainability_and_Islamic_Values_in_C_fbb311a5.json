Your content itself is strong, with clear connections to values, ethics, and holistic approaches that align well with the program's focus.\n\nHere are my recommendations to improve the presentation:\n\n1. **Standardize the format** across all positions. Currently, there are inconsistencies between how you've formatted the first set of entries versus the last two.\n\n2. **Focus on depth over breadth** by highlighting specific skills and experiences that demonstrate your understanding of Islamic concepts or psychological principles.\n\n3. **Balance quantitative achievements** (like the numbers in your Bloom.pm entry) with qualitative impacts that show transformation and meaning-making.\n\nHere's a revised version that keeps your strong content while improving consistency and impact:\n\n```\n♦ **Five One Labs, Erbil, Iraq** ♦ Curriculum Consultant ♦ 2025 ♦ \nEnriched entrepreneurship curriculum with sustainability principles, integrating values-based decision-making to align ethical intent with green practices.
