The modern entrepreneurs of today are able to push their thinking beyond traditional methods (e.g. the usual Facebook post or a simple Google display ad) and find ways of truly maximizing both budget and effort. And the primary way to do this? Testing and experimentation 🔬\n\nIn this video, Rayan introduces the 'Growth Hacking Mindset', what it is, how it compares to traditional digital marketing, and how to use testing and optimization to drive more sales/acquisitions this month than you did last month, and even more next month than you'll do this month - all by applying the growth hacking mindset to your business 📈\n\nWatch Part 1\nWatch Part 2\"\n🎓 Training Activity 1: Creating Landing Pages That Sell\t🏗 Organizational Infrastructure\tCreating Landing Pages That Sell\t\"💻 These videos with marketing professional Paul Finch take you through the difference between a website and landing page, what the core components and modules are to make one convert, how to structure and design your page, and how to cheat to get a higher converting page.\n\nWhile you watch, think about these questions:\n🌻     How is a landing page different than a general website?\n🌻     What type of landing page is best suited to your business needs?\n🌻     What are some landing pages that inspire you?\n\nWatch the videos below:\n- Part 1: Five Tips Before You Start\n- Part 2: How To Design Your Landing Page\n- Part 3: Examples Of Great Landing Pages\"\n🎓 Training Activity 2: Tools To Power Conversions\t🏗 Organizational Infrastructure\tTools To Power Conversions\t\"💡 A landing page is not something that works in isolation. On the contrary, it's a single piece of the puzzle to get sales. You now need to drive traffic to it, engage users so that they understand your proposition, persuade them to convert to a lead, and then nurture that lead to convert it to a sale. \n\nFortunately, there are many tools available that can do the heavy lifting for you. In this video, Rayan shares 10 essential tools that can give you maximum marketing output with the minimal effort, money, and resources.\"\n🎓 Training Activity 1: Finding Your Market\t🤝 Community Engagement & Communication\tFinding Your Market\t\"Ready to begin? 😄 This first training activity with Anthony Haddad will guide you through the process of analyzing different potential markets. In this training activity you will learn how to 1) identify the highest potential market for you, 2) conduct a thorough market analysis, and 3) develop a clear strategy for choosing a target market.\n\nYou might feel like your market has already been chosen for you, but think outside the box 💡 What are the benefits of operating in your home city vs. another city? Could opportunities exist in other markets that are more difficult to access? Don't be afraid to dream big 💭\n\nWhile you watch Anthony present, reflect on these questions:\n🌻     What is your current target market? Why did you choose it?\n🌻     What market research have you already done? \n🌻     What market research methodology will be most useful to you? (Hint: think from an investor's perspective).\"",
