      "content": "The power requirements for a micro AcePC, such as those in the mini PC range, can vary depending on the specific model. Typically, these devices require a DC input, and it's not uncommon for them to use 12V power supplies. However, the amperage can differ.\n\nFor most models of AcePC mini PCs, such as the T11 or AK2, a 12V power supply is standard. The required amperage usually ranges from 2A to 3A. Therefore, using a 12V power supply at 3A is generally suitable and should be safe for most AcePC mini PC models. However, it's crucial to check the exact specifications of your specific model. You can usually find this information on the power adapter that came with the device, in the user manual, or on the manufacturer's website.\n\nAlways make sure that the power adapter you use matches the required specifications to avoid any risk of damaging the device.",
