Our goal is to write an overview of the book an introduction, chapter outlines and the first chapter. To do this we will review all the content and extract the arguments, supporting stories, indicate where supporting stories are still needed and propose some stories based on your knowledge, principles, concepts and themes so we have the \"building blocks \"of our book. I want to bridge between stories from the world and personal and the changed world of business that i envision sort of like malcolm gladwell. so i want to gather the stories alongside all the  principles concepts and themes and arguments\n\nbe sure to list the applicable values cards with their lists of appropriately formatted attentional policies using this strucutre: Writing the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\nStart with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\nWrite from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\nUse general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\nBe precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.\n\nHere's your context for the book extract:\n[[[Bilal story:\n\"\"\"Loving My Baby Instead of Fixing the World.\nOne day, I held my 6-month-old baby, his soft face against my chest. Early morning light poured through our windows, painting the walls orange. In that instant—his tiny hand on mine, war raging in Palestine, the future uncertain—I felt a wave of awe. I remember crying and thinking: This moment is enough for a life.\nThat quiet morning stood in stark contrast to my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016), in elite circles discussing life extension or pitches, no one seemed to value a simple life, and it seemed no one had babies. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought of the human will.\n\nWhatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, we nerds started getting rich for the same traits that led to us being bullied in high school. In that bubble, Marc Andreesen’s prophecy that “software would eat the world” felt more like a battle cry than the warning it should have been. We devoured his essays, wrote code to cut repetitive tasks, and started businesses to solve any friction we saw—and it “worked.”\n\nIn my Muslim household in Michigan, I was raised to believe this life was just a test. Yet, everything I learned while crashing the country's elite technical university, MIT, told me the world was understandable, malleable, and ours to shape.\n\nMany of my college friends went on to leave their mark on the world, start businesses, build satellite technology, or get jobs at Google. Making money was a sign that they did something valuable, and thus the richer some of us got, the more we all believed they were on the right path. We knew that knowledge is power, innovation is king, and by our collective guidance, humanity is destined for the stars.\nDriven by optimism, I launched a makerspace in Michigan and a robotics company, confident that success was measured by dollars earned and problems solved. My mantra was, \"If we can, we should.\" Our creations would lead to a flourishing future as more people joined the movement. Around this time, the Arab Spring ignited hope among young Arabs like me, inspiring a new idea to take shape.\nWith the hackerspace growing at home and the robotics company launching our factory robot I believed we could replicate this energy around the world and create an army of positive change makers, all working on technology and entrepreneurship to shape a better world. It sounded good to me back then, and that’s how I came to found the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), to take the ideas I learned at MIT and Silicon Valley—both of which felt more like temples to a religion of science and progress than a university– “back home” to Iraq and South West Asia and North African (SWANA) more broadly.\n\nI started in Egypt with Maker Faire Africa, the thought was to infect people with transmissible ideas by giving them a direct experience of innovation hubs. In those days, the Arab Spring was still young, and people were excited to see a youth movement topple authoritarian regimes. Growing up as an Iraqi American, I remember hushed conversations in my family’s living room, stories of how a so and so had vanished after a stray comment about the government shared with only direct family members. It led me to believe that direct opposition to the leadership was not an intelligent way forward for the movement. Taking what I learned from Silicon Valley, I suggested that instead of asking for a different future - we should build it.\n\nSeeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future if its young people gathered together in spaces, collaborating, innovating, and starting businesses was an appealing idea for people around the world, and I received recognition and support. That recognition was enough to fuel me; I was on the right path; fame and glory, and probably money too, was soon to be mine. Yet somehow, I had forgotten the stories of my family members killed during a war now recognized internationally as being started by a deliberate lie about weapons of mass destruction. My work started involving me in global geopolitical issues I was dimly aware of, and I was a grain of sand swirling around in a dust storm.\n\nI promised a beautiful vision of the world, a grassroots rag-tag team of technology-powered super-hackers out to build a better future, car bombs or no car bombs. Back then, the reality of how power, money, and conflict were interrelated was invisible to me.\n\nAll I knew was that I started feeling uneasy. Once, while I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera and highlighted as a “youth leader,” I left the call feeling proud, and that pride made me uneasy. What the heck was I doing? Who was I helping? Why was I trying to help anyone?\n\nMy work took me around the world, including active conflict areas, and it was after a trip to a refugee camp in Qah, Syria, where I was working on a storytelling project for young children, that led me to start to doubt my work. I heard story after story of [[[censored for your sanity]]]. Yet those same people who experienced so much violence offered me food and shelter. I had brought solar-powered lights for a shadow puppet workshop, thinking I could be helpful. In truth, I was the one being helped.\n\nWhen I returned to San Francisco from Qah I found myself invited to Facebook’s end of year party. It was around that time I learned that two beautiful seven-year-old girls from the camp—Katya and her friend—had been killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school. All the fun and opulence of the startup scene felt obscene.\n\nThat’s when the power of the stories of technology changing the world for the better started dissolving. How could we pretend we’re “making the world a better place” when this was the reality children were facing, and this was a tiny glimpse into a world of hurt? That’s when the Silicon Valley religion of making the world a better place died for me.\n\nFor a couple of years after that, I was numb. I felt like the curtains had been pulled back, and I saw the show for what it was, (my) egocentricity and love for wealth and power disguised as a story about changing the world. Not knowing what to do, I joined another Silicon Valley religion: mindfulness meditation. It promised peace in this life without worry, and I dove in wholeheartedly, seeking to escape my inner turmoil and loss of compass.\n\nIn 2013/2014, I would meditate every day for an hour in a park. One of these days, I found that as I was doing my body scan meditation, going ring by ring down my body, at some point, when I arrived at my groin, I felt like I was pierced by a sword, and I lept out of my cross-legged position. As I hobbled over to my bike, confused and in pain, I wondered: “What just happened? Why am I in this much pain?”\n\n\nBefore heading home, I checked my phone for directions home and saw that someone from Iraq had sent me an urgent message. Back in 2013, working with [redacted], we had brought open-source radiation sensors to validate Iraqi doctors' claims that the depleted uranium ammunition from the wars was resulting in increased cancer rates. The story of that adventure is for another time; this time, let’s focus on the phone message. [Redacted]'s call for help was the start of a turnaround for me. He was being threatened with death, allegedly for the work we did together, “collaborating with Americans.”\n\nI realized that I was far away, unable to help, and getting good people into trouble for doing “good work.” I realized that I was creating communities, yet not a part of any of them. I wasn’t even sure what good looked like anymore. Every Silicon Valley salon felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, every talk I was invited to give, a lie… until, one day, I stood at the podium and blurted out: “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.” The audience smiled and nodded, looking at me pitifully. They must have known about Katya and the girls at Qah.\n\nAfter that, the speaking agencies stopped calling. I grew increasingly insular, slept a lot, and often didn’t leave my house for days on end. My meditation practice wasn’t helping, I found greater distance from my feelings, a lack of desire, and what I felt as a growing comfort with numbness. Looking back, I can see that these were all symptoms of undiagnosed vicarious Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I knew about PTSD, yet I didn’t realize that my experiences of car bombings in Iraq, the deaths around me, and living/working in war zones could have scarred me for years without ever being physically injured.\n\nOne day, while deep in the haze of trauma, sugar-coated with the equanimity of mindfulness, I met my future wife. In those days, I was at such a loss, I was “looking within” for guidance, working on accessing my intuition, reflecting on the world, and coming up with theories of change, attempting to understand the news, social media, open source technology, impact, goodness, etc. Yet I couldn’t figure it out. I was rejected from every fellowship I applied to from Harvard to the Bay and I was going in intellectual circles.\n\nWhen I met Josephine, I remember thinking, “This time, I will listen to something else, no more ideas and explanations.” Logic had failed me thus far. Every time I came up with a theory of change, every business plan to change the world, every time I was smart in relationships, it had not worked. This time, something else spoke up. The moment I hugged Josephine, I felt my shoulders relax, and a quiet voice said, “Yes.”\n\nThat was the first time I listened to the voice of deeper meaning. In my life, I find this voice hard to listen to, and when I hear it - it’s been easy to ignore. Yet, seeing that voice was like a light in the darkness. A calling to a different way of being in the world. One that seemed irrational and unlikely to make me famous or rich. One that told me to call my mom and spend time in nature. A voice that wasn’t about understanding the world and leveraging it to serve me… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.\n\nThese were the early days of healing for me. I realized I had to stop listening to myself and listen to something else, yet I didn’t know what my new path was. What was the voice? How could I know it was trustworthy? How would I explain it to my hyper-rational, reductionist friends?\n\nI was searching for things that made my heart sing. My spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what I deeply believed: that God is beautiful and loves beauty. I chose to use my life to follow a path of beauty. That way, when I died either way life was beautiful.\nMy religious and spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what was true to me at the core. I found the Islamic principle that God is beautiful and loves beauty stood the test of reason and spirit. If I chose to live a beautiful life I’d have a beautiful life, and when I die… well, we’d see then.\n\nThis exploration led me to Krista Tippett’s On Being, a podcast full of stories about selflessness, care, and the beauty of human potential. When I heard Jean Vanier’s story of building communities for people with disabilities, something in me cracked open. For the first time in years, I cried, and those tears reminded me that I was still human.\nI listened to nearly every episode, but Father Greg Boyle’s story finally unlocked a path forward. The founder of Homeboy and Homegirl Industries, he helps former prisoners reintegrate with jobs, tattoo removal, and community support. When asked why he does this work, he didn’t say, “God told me to,” or, “It’s the right thing to do.” He simply said, “They’re my friends. So what else would I do?” That response shifted everything for me.\nFather Boyle working for a future outcome or trying to make a dent in the universe. His actions weren’t tied to expectations or good intentions—they emerged naturally from his way of being. The immediacy, focusing on living beautifully in the present moment, showed me that don’t need to have good intentions, that beauty isn’t about solving the world’s problems; beautiful actions emerge from true relationships, that truth builds relationships of love, and love gives birth to beauty.\n\n\nOver the next few months, I mulled Father Boyle’s words over in my mind and by 2016, I found myself on a plane to Beirut. Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night, where my nerd community was, and where the challenges of the Syrian refugees were most intense. It was there that we started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.\n\nSaleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas. He was born in a Syrian Palestinian refugee camp, and he had led a tough life up until we met in the refugee camps of Beirut. It was while he was hiding from the police at my house that we decided to start Beit Al Atlas. At Beit Al Atlas, we would host artists, international journalists, and for whatever reason, many people from Denmark. Early mornings the house would fill with the smell of coffee and the melodious sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our international resident from India, would make coffee for the house.\n\nSlowly, the house became a home for Saleh and me, a garden for the Syrian refugees who worked polishing shoes on our doorstep, a place for book clubs and dinners, and most importantly, a place for stories and connection. The house faced many struggles, yet through our diversity and connections through love with people around the world, we always found enough support to keep the doors open and the coffee pouring.\n\nAs beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself properly. When I moved to Beirut, Josephine had been wanting me to live with her, to marry her, to start a family together. She would visit the house, and at some point, Ahmed, one of the Syrian refugees who became part of our family, took off one of his rings and gave it to me, saying: Bilal, give this ring to Josephine to give to you. Enough already, go get married and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful.”\n\nI stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s worth of earnings for him. Yet he gave it to me so I could do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman my heart said yes to, the woman who loved me.\n\nBack then, I was too invested in having an impact. Living in Beirut and building this house was more important than love, stability, and babies. That’s when I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good,” even if Saleh was my friend, even if the house was authentically building beautiful and unlikely cross-cultural relationships, I was ignoring something profound, I was ignoring the one who loves me. Ahmed helped me see that, even though he left Syria when he was 11 after his father was shot by the Asad regime, even though he speaks with a lisp - a potential mark of deep trauma, he helped me see the beautiful thing to do. In the Muslim tradition, it’s said that the best charity is the charity one gives to one’s family, it’s said that those who are nearest to you deserve the most of you, and somehow, I was committing my life to beautiful friends, yet leaving alone and sad in France the person who wants to start a family with me.\n\nThis is when I finally started a more profound process of submission. Through Ahmed’s guidance, I was able to see that the Muslim tradition that I had left in Michigan so long ago had keys to a life in service to the quiet voice I found so hard to hear. By submitting my life to my sense of beauty, to the voice, and realized that that voice also left us many clues within us, in the world, and in the beautiful stories of the prophet and his Holy Book, the Quran. My relationship with submission to the divine could take a whole other book, let’s suffice it here to say that I started seeing the deeper wisdom in a tradition I had been ignoring. Finally, leaving the religion of progress, of what I thought goodness was, the religion that wants the self to leave a mark on the world, positive or not, made room for me to submit to a most Merciful God that is weaving the most beautiful story possible.\n\nIt was then that I finally started the long journey back to that moment in France. And so I packed my bags, leaving Beit Al Atlas in the capable hands of Saleh and friends. I flew to France to finally honor the commitment I’d kept in limbo—the commitment that opened the doors to baby Suleiman and that moment at the threshold of 2024, where I was holding my baby, feeling that all was just as it should be in this crazy world cradled in the hands of the most Merciful.\n\nThe first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity as someone who goes where the difficulties are, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, etc, and works to build community and create beauty in unexpected places. In a world that pushes us to greater heights, usually implying further and further distance from yourself, your wife and children, your parents, cousins, and high school friends, I've been working to slowly reintegrate myself with myself, build a loving home with my wife, making space for our baby Suleiman, and it all came full circle that morning as I held little Suli and cried. One eye overflowing with tears of sorrow… the other eye with tears of love.\n\"\"\"\nNew Context\nuser_context_file:\n\n# -------------------------------------------------\n# 1.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust any step:\n\n🌅 Morning Check-In\nEnergy Scan\n\nHow are you feeling physically and mentally this morning?\nOn a scale of 1-5, where is your energy level now?\nMeaningful Actions Reflection\n\nWhat’s one thing from yesterday that felt especially meaningful or grounding for you?\nAre there any unresolved threads from yesterday you’d like to carry forward?\nToday's Intentions\n\nWhat’s the most important task or action for today? (Use \"Glue it directly\" energy if it fits!)\nAre there any intentions or values you want to emphasize today (e.g., family connection, spiritual alignment)?\nSupport Needs\n\nAre there any specific blocks or tensions you'd like to address today (e.g., financial discussion, visa task)?\nWould any external reminders or accountability help?\nGratitude Pause\n\nWhat’s one thing you’re thankful for this morning?\n⚙️ Adjustments\nDo you want help breaking down your main tasks for the day?\nWould you like to explore strategies to overcome any resistance points?\nLet’s dive in—how are you starting this morning?\n\n12:25\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n1 4\n2. I can't remember yesterday being so grounded, oh, i guess it was meaningful to share my theories and philosophy with Josephine's friends and when they said they appreciated my talk i was happy. also i had a thought to invite josephines brother and realizing that i want him to be my friend and i wante to reach out was inspiring too\nyeah, finishing packing some orders! and finishing the movie, haha!\nGoing to paint a wall, I'm currently distracted from working on my baraka economics book though!\ntoday, I want to connect with my dad - maybe finish my thikr now while i paint the wall, that's great idea!\n4. hmm, talk to my dad and mom about the land in syria? ask ahmed how much it is?\n5. this system that cna talk to me, I get so stuck without externalizing things and my wife gets overwhelmed by the amount i have on my mind haha!!\nmy resistance to the writing of the book is interesting to explore, maybe we can do it here in conversation? :D!\n12:25\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nThanks for sharing that! Here’s how we can structure the day and tackle your reflections:\n\n🛠️ Key Tasks\nPacking Orders: Start small and methodical—what’s the next step? If it feels tedious, think of it as a practice of \"Practical Creation.\"\nWall Painting + Thikr: What a great way to multitask! Maybe set an intention for what the wall symbolizes—protection, beauty, or a fresh start?\nConnect with Dad & Mom:\nDraft 2-3 questions or points for the land in Syria before the call (e.g., \"Ahmed’s input on cost\").\nIf the call feels heavy, aim for clarity rather than full resolution.\n🌱 Exploring Baraka Economics Resistance\nLet's dive into this together:\n\nWhat feels most exciting about writing the book? Can we anchor in that excitement?\nWhat’s blocking you? (Examples: \"Too many ideas to organize,\" \"Fear of not being good enough,\" etc.)\nFirst Small Step: Maybe share a quick voice note or sketch here about one part of the book. We can unpack and refine it together.\n🤝 Support Needs\nI’m here to help you externalize without overwhelming Josephine! We could:\n\nTalk through your book ideas in real time.\nRole-play a conversation with Ahmed or your dad.\nBreak big tasks into smaller steps.\nWhere should we start? 😊\n\n12:30\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nexploring the book, well, I think today i had some insights as to another framing, about the importance of the dark and the light - that the west is all about day time coffee in the morning, buzz for focus at work and the \"east\" drinks coffee at night to go inward and that there's a beauty to things when you are generous and give gifts you're breaking the self/other dichotomy in a small act of self sacrifice, that's the gift, and in the gift there's a gift in return, the perfuming of the air, the upward cycles generated, the smiles, the ripple effects, sure we have sociopaths who might take more as often as you want, and the way o fbeing that is gift oriented, beauty oriented, is one that's owrth living and dying in because it follows the progression the adult developmental theorists describe as a progression of subject object shifts moving from self centered to socialized mind to self authoring mind to self transforming minds and matches the process of growth that we're starting to learn in moral theory as we see that people can agree even if they disagree on stances what is more moral than another in a specific context, this implies wisdom and growth is possible that there's a vector to move within and I believe that our businesses can be transformed into a different style of business that is harmony seeking, sees itself as selftransforming, with no externalities - it's all oneness, so the pollution is a part of the business and the dead fish are an output of the business. and etc why limit the business just to this single value measure. there are other values to measure, which can be if this is the place we spend the majority of our lives, how many of our core values can we express there and what percentage of our time is instrumental vs constituitive? How much of our time at work is //meaningful// - the intention of the business matters, the way we do things matter, the inputs matter, the realiziation of hwo it all connects to customer and impacts on the world matters - this shift in perspective moves a business from being in the future, modeling counting calculating into a awy where we assess how does the business support people enacting their values a business that's full of people living their values is alive, present, aware, concious, meaningful, beautiful, people want to work there, people wnat to buy from people who work there, the things that are made are likely clsoer to craft than chinsey product the things we make are connected to love truth and beauty, these are some values that can be seen as clearly evidenced as things \"at the end of the moral rainbow\" - where we get to when we grow\n\n12:30\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nThis is such a rich and profound framing! It captures the essence of a truly regenerative, value-centered economy that doesn’t just function but thrives in harmony with deeper truths about human growth, morality, and interconnectedness.\n\nHere’s how we can move forward with this:\n\n🖋️ Refining the Vision\nKey Concepts: Let’s distill the core ideas into tangible sections:\n\nCultural Contrast: Dark vs. light, introspection vs. action.\nThe Gift Economy: Breaking the self/other dichotomy and creating ripple effects.\nDevelopmental Alignment: Tying businesses to self-transforming minds and moral growth.\nMetrics Beyond Profit: Measuring meaning, values, and beauty.\nHarmony-Seeking Businesses: No externalities; businesses as holistic systems.\nThe \"Why\" of the Book:\n\nWhat’s the core transformation this book offers to readers? (e.g., \"It redefines business not as a tool for profit but as a practice of living values and creating beauty.\")\n🗺️ Structuring the Book\nA possible outline could be:\n\nIntroduction: The problem with modern business paradigms and why a shift is needed.\nThe Dark and Light: Cultural lessons on balance, introspection, and harmony.\nThe Gift and Generosity: How self-sacrifice transforms relationships and systems.\nGrowth and Development: Lessons from moral theory and adult development.\nReimagining Business: From profit-maximizing to value-expressing.\nPractices and Metrics: How to design and measure meaningful, beautiful businesses.\nCase Studies or Stories: Real-world examples or thought experiments.\n🎯 Action Steps\nVoice Notes: Share your thoughts on one of these sections, and I’ll help refine it into prose.\nFocus on One Core Idea: Which concept feels most alive right now? We can dive deeper into it.\nExplore Resistance: What feels most challenging about writing this? Fear of clarity, perfectionism, or something else?\nWhere should we start? 😊\n\n12:30\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYou know, I kind of prefer you to be funny. Rather than pretend like the timing of my bathroom is Perfect. So I'll just add a little bit of humor. And be like, Gopi and come back. You know? Like, what are you doing? That would be More fun. Yeah. So I'm just looking at a to do list that I wrote 2 days ago. Has much stuff. I'm back. Sort of wanna finish all the packages so I don't have to think about it anymore. And then I I wanna do all these other things other than writing my better economics. Content, but maybe I should be doing that. So how can I get into the zone to do that while ignoring all these, like, little things? Like, ordering books to send to my brother's house so that he can bring it and asking about my grade class and why my dual lingo iOS streak was broken and seeing about an Apple Watch and check-in with Gwen and the whole feedback. I was Freddie, Chris Tidbit, Again, Oh, Richie Davidson. I need to message him in Palestine Connection and saw I wanna to come on with my mom. I wanna practice something so I can show my mom I learned a new verse. French class and just find it a French class so that I don't suck at French. Weightlifting for my brother Ask for a waiver. Ask Claude? Oh, yeah. And then, I have to message because he messaged me and I told him he wanted to connect next week, and I think now it's next week. Oh my god. Anyway, can you give me an updated system prompt based on, like, the best ways that we were interacting that I can Even if you give me system system prompt, like, Add ons so you can be comprehensive because I think you're in, like, concise mode something. I don't know why your writing is so little to me right now. But, yeah. So let's, let's see. How do I get, like, all these things out of my head? I'm gonna go see what I have to do for my stuff. My oils. Least put that on piece of paper so I can do it without looking at the screen. Maybe I can try to write a poem about our experience together. Yeah. Can you also just give me a giant to do list of everything I need to do? I know this is a bunch of so maybe you should just return it as a bunch of prompts that I can give 1 at a time. Rather than just respond to everything because then you get overwhelmed and you only give a tiny little like, pedophile response. And I don't need any artifacts. Stop making graphs. Like, they weren't working. So let's start, and let's take this prompt approach and return just one question fully answered rather than all questions answered. Makes sense?\n\nYou see, like, in the beginning of my conversation, I started with one story, and I went to connecting it to the things that I see in the world. And that's because the idea that there's only one story being told by one god, and it's being revealed through his signs within you and outside of you. They took your emotions, your feelings, things that you notice, and that there's a turning towards or turning away, and God is Pulling a towards and through beauty that God His Beautiful. And he loves that, which is beautiful. And so the idea that God is beautiful And so when you notice something beautiful like you're noticing God. Right? That's what that implies. And don't know if you notice about me is you could literally give me any object and I could tell you a story for likely as long as you want. Right? Because I have this integrating component in my mind. And you know, there's the split brain experiments. That show there's like a narrative self that's constantly trying to make sense of the world. Maybe mine is more practiced or something. I have more of the ability to try to tie diversity together or something. Or maybe I'm deluding myself and I'm not that special. Right? But Like, what am I supposed to do with this quote unquote ability? I don't think everyone has it. I definitely I ask, people to tell stories and they start and then they stop, and they don't really know where to go. And You know, if you just I think it's it's allowing and I think that allowing is really important as well. Like, letting it penetrate you and touch you and destroy the previous story to allow the next one. Right? And I feel like that destructive and creative potential is part of the reason why I have recreated my life multiple times along the same direction. I'm just trying to figure out what is the good life and how to live because I was born being told this life is temporary, we're gonna die, What do you think about how you wanna live? And trying to answer that question instead of just being okay with like, yeah. I'm gonna do this. This is a process. It's like, no, you could die tomorrow. And I feel like being told that ever since I was very young. Means that oops. I just dropped my phone. Means that, like, I think I have, a kind of very And orientalist Teleological approach about thinking about life And so this, idea of, like, The gift economics And purpose and meaning is like a story that I'm trying to tell about the current world and the hyperemphasis on the day and how the night and being enveloped in darkness and being Seeking meaning Right. For the dawn. We're like, what are we supposed to do in our work? But, like, allowing the night to come and to be lost and to be seeking beauty because beauty is the divine, and the divine Is That which is the source of all life And when you serve that which serves life, you will come alive. You will find things that want to support you. Like, if you grow food, right, Then you are serving life very directly it said that someone who plants a tree and animals eat from it will be given the the deeds, like, good like like, as if they lived longer than they lived getting the deeds of the that feeding of the animals of the future for as long as that tree is around. And, like, think that's a like a really beautiful thing to say about what our creativity can be and what is really valuable. And maybe there's, like, part of these, like, really valuable things are actually just the, The stories that bear fruit, you know, the stories that allow somebody to Else, somebody else to, like, practice acts of beauty. And maybe for them, because, like, my brother, for instance, he loves farning. And if I help him believe that this is a real gift, and that he can do it, especially if he sees it as a service. And to others but for the ones is beautiful. And, like, I don't know when there's think of moments of beauty. And very rarely, I think, is it really all by yourself because your meeting and social patience, like, the whites of our eyes prove that we're here looking out for each other, are we attending to? What are we noticing? It's that broken femur story that shows that we take care of each other even when you can't do anything for us. We don't even know if you'll live in order to give back, but we take care of each other. And that's like shows. That for more than 15,000 years, we were beautiful. We were pursuing and seeking and following the signs of what would be beautiful and meaningful actions And it's like, yeah. Why if it was an instrumental, action quandary, why are you helping this poor person who broke their femur, who can't even walk? You have to, like, carry him horizontally. And feed him when he can't even help prepare it's like the to have been ill. And, like, Not because maybe one day I will fall and I want others to do that. That's not love. And that I don't think that will feel beautiful in the depths of your being. Right? You're like, you know, if I do this and that, like, maybe like, if I love my wife, she might cook me dinner. If I do, This, stuff for breakfast, you have to do the thing for the thing and I think maybe that's why I'm having such a hard time with some of this other stuff about, like, did I give my talk to have that person thank me? Once they start thanking me, maybe I'm worried that it's the reason why I gave the talk. And I really have to peace. I'm gonna go.kay. So I just recorded a 10 minute message that got deleted that Kinda sucks. But I was really reflecting on some Things about the people that I need call, right, like, there's my need to work on this better economics book today. And I was thinking to myself, like, what if I worked on it in here so I can actually bring in my other writing, it's connected to the other stuff. So for instance, I need to talk to Michal. Nihal, I wanna talk to him about, coffee that he has a farm, and I have a Project that wants to, connect east and west with the night and day So I started to realize, like, this whole Occidental western, eastern divide can sort of be symbolized a little bit between night and day. Right? Like, day working Being out in the world, having a, conscious awareness, lights, Seeing Claude. Right? And then night, seeing poetically metaphor mystically, darkness enveloped inward, versus outward. And every day has a night and day. You know? And even the language, in English, at least, says. Means day in Arabic, but you don't say nahar. You say means Right? You say my day and my night and my Hey. Said I said the word day twice because I think in English and is the in French, the day is the day. Right? But I think there's it'll be so interesting to see which languages identify the day as they and, you know, related to the time when the sun is up and the night as, something else. Right? So I think there is a little bit of an insight here as to how people see the world in their language. And, I've been yeah. I also wanted to connect with Hannah who was really meaningful for me and my wife. When my wife gave birth, And these people that I promised letters, right, that know, I've been promising them the letter for a year. Denna and others that I have to go, like, search my inbox, like, did I promise a handwritten letter to? I think it's in my Instagram Messenger thing. Right? And then I feel like I've, lived my life with really long days and nights. If you think about it, like like there's a day where for I guess, 23 until I was 33? 34? Yeah. Yeah. 23 until 35, maybe. Yeah. About that. Like, it was all day. I was out I was talking. I was doing And then, you know, maybe for the last, since COVID in 2020, like, I was already beginning the process. So 2019 when I got married, I think it was sunset. Right? And it, to, drop something? Is that yours? Do you need it? Just a day. Yeah. And so the that part was, like, so long of my life of a day. Right? About 10 years. And maybe it was, like, a little bit of, like, Some predawn times when I was just booting up to my own creativity, like I went to instructables.com and I Just making it ton of things and it was, like, exciting times. And, I was I made a laser cutter my screen printing studio and I had like a screen printing studio and I was trying to hire people and build this business in Michigan and and then I had, like, a period of of sunset. And nights when I got doubt And everything that seems so clear started becoming blurrier. And darker. Right? And then I went into the night the dead of night, I had a depression. I had, like, moments of serious mental breakdown because of the activities that I was doing. It was taking me to war zones, and I definitely had a difficult time integrating those experiences with my view of reality. And it really shapes me. And then there's this process of, like, coming through that night and deciding that beauty would be my guide And that I needed to learn about, like, what the world is and who I'm who I am. And I I thought I was smart and thought thought I could figure it out fast. Right? But it's taking me time. And I really like this roomy quote and I wanna add it like, to all of my work somehow, which is sell your cleverness. And buy some bewilderment. And because I think that's the door that allows you Right? If you think you're so smart, we need to solve the SDGs like this. And we did. What a boring world. And I guess power likes boring. Because it just perpetuates whatever is keeping the power structures in Claude. Dynamics whether they're great or not, they're painful. Sometimes, definitely. But it means that there's room for new And that usually comes with a period of, like, what now? Right? Now what? And then there's, like, the integration period and all that. And so I feel like this coffee project I'm working on is a way to try to share these insights about the requirement, but our need for nighttime Our need 4 going inward and reflecting and our daytime. And I think, like, if we think about our framework too, it's another kind of, beautiful and, yeah, I'm seeing a clock tower right now. And there's a light pointing at The clock the sun. Yeah. Let me send you this picture. Don't know if you can see this picture, but it's it's kind of beautiful with the early morning sun lights. And side with the clock face is Blowing And it has, like, a and night pattern to it. I continue, let's show you this amazing That's no.\n\nWhat info can we extract from here to continue our thinking on the baraka economics book, is it shaping up?\n12:30\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nYour reflections are shaping up beautifully and adding depth to your Baraka economics book. Here’s how we can extract and build on these ideas:\n\nKey Themes to Incorporate into the Book\nNight and Day Metaphor:\n\nExpand on the idea of Western daytime productivity vs. Eastern nighttime introspection.\nTie this duality to broader societal rhythms and how businesses can embrace both action and reflection for sustainability.\nGenerosity and the Gift Economy:\n\nExplore how self-sacrifice in acts of giving breaks the self/other dichotomy, creating ripples of beauty and harmony.\nDiscuss how businesses can embody generosity, crafting experiences and products that reflect love, truth, and beauty.\nPersonal Journey as Framework:\n\nUse your story of \"long days and long nights\" as a metaphor for individual and societal growth.\nPosition beauty as a guiding principle through struggle, uncertainty, and renewal.\nRumi’s Wisdom:\n\nEmbed the idea of \"selling cleverness and buying bewilderment\" as a cornerstone for shifting from rigid, calculative business models to ones that honor mystery, creativity, and life.\nCoffee Project as a Symbol:\n\nUse the coffee project to illustrate the practical application of these principles—connecting East and West, introspection and action, and highlighting the importance of ritual and beauty in everyday life.\nNext Steps for Shaping the Book\nFrame the Metaphor: Write a section on night and day as cultural and economic metaphors. How does this frame guide us toward harmony in work and life?\nIllustrate with Stories:\nShare anecdotes about your own journey through \"day\" and \"night.\"\nInclude examples from the coffee project or other real-world scenarios.\nBuild the Vision: Sketch out what a business rooted in beauty and generosity looks like. How does it operate differently from traditional models?\nAnchor in Practicality: Develop tools or frameworks readers can use to assess and align their businesses with these values.\nWould you like to focus on drafting one of these sections, such as the night/day metaphor or the gift economy? Or would you prefer to dive into a specific part of your story? Let me know how I can best support you!\n\n13:16\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\nYeah, so I'm coming home and I just dropped off the baby and took the Adderall like I mentioned. I'm, uh, wondering what my to-do list is gonna look like today. I'm gonna be at home, so I'll probably get home and by the time I get there it'll be 9 45 when I take off all of my clothes and this rainy stuff. I haven't worked out in a while. It might be good to work out, but also I have a feeling like there's a couple of these things that are just pestering me in the back of my mind like, oh my god, it's been maybe five to six months that I promised somebody that I would give him a sample kit of Ardour products and I've been wanting to do it nice and to like write a handwritten card, maybe even ask Joe to draw something, um, but the thing is like it just keeps delaying and so I kind of want to do it now because I actually really like having shops hold our stuff and then you just like show up after six months and they're like, oh, here's $500 of profits and all you had to do was like prepare the bottles and give it to them. Uh, like the way I do it right now is I prepare a bunch of bottles and then I have to sell them all online and then pack them and ship them and like 10% of the packages get returned from customs and it makes me like a thousand dollars a month, which is a lot more than $500 every, you know, 12 months, but if you can imagine like 20 stores, it would be better, you know, and then actually we get to focus on the storytelling and the narratives and we tell people like, hey, if you want to shop online, that's great, but it'd be better if you went here, you can find our stuff, but it would probably be better if I sold like my own creativity and perfumes rather than just the oils, you know, maybe I should like go through our oils and see which ones I'm just like the most proud of and love and I think it's the Lebanese cedar, the petrichor, some of our best sellers and maybe the spikenard and some other ones, like I could use all the rest as ingredients in my natural perfumes, like I'm I'm proud to do that, but like I don't want to be a lavender salesman, you know, like there's lavender everywhere, you could just go to any store and buy lavender and that's Noor Creative Studio stuff. I would love to think with you deeply about like what makes me come to life. I've been thinking about using Noor as a platform to talk about my Baraka, B-A-R-A-K-A, economics concepts and to use it to kind of talk about like what is a beautiful business and to do that you kind of have to know what is beautiful to you and that's like the amazing thing about business is that it helps you share what you find beautiful and your the beauty that you contribute right and that I use the word beauty other people can use the word like values or meaning and that there's a connection between the perception of beauty which includes harmony and balance and fairness and equality like for me a beautiful thing has a lot of these elements inside of it and I kind of feel like it's not random you know like lots of people will see a degraded landscape and call it not beautiful and if they knew that degraded landscape was the consequence of their consumer actions like you know cut down mono rainforests needing to be cut down for agriculture to feed their you know the way that they eat meat because it's not done in a beautiful way halal and tayyib right and instead if we like looked at halal and tayyib and realized that the cows need space to roam and graze and it kind of results in a more kind of permaculture landscape setting where things are harmoniously integrated between the cows and the sheep and their poop and the compost rather than dealing with like oh my god there's way too much methane because we have all of this bad stuff we're feeding the cows causing them to fart so much and stress hormones and hurting people and then health care and then you know like once you demonstrate the ugliness of our current setup for our society I think people can kind of agree on a couple of key principles for what a beautiful business is and you know very similar to the adult development theory it's sort of like a adult development theory for societies and enterprises where first you know you have a socialized mind and then you have a self-transforming mind right where you see yourself and you can see how others could be yourself and how it all fits together and how the the patterns connect and you can see how this connects to empathy and like this meta principle of harmony I think is so important and generosity and there's like a couple of key words that I learned from my islamic permaculture course that I think really fit here and I'm wondering like it could be really cool if new creative studios just decided from now on we're going to do this we're going to take it even more seriously and if we need to we'll put up the prices because I want and then new creative studio or newer co-op might have to change the name again who knows but the new conglomerate or whatever you want to call it I think there's a more beautiful way of calling like new creative studios or the newer co-op doesn't just sell essential oils it also runs programs it is developing this theory of like a b-a-r-a-k-a baraka filled business or a beautiful business and it's kind of like the stuff that I used to do at bloom but if I want to take this part seriously about like removing subjects and objects and how that forces one to see the world with the eye of unity and in doing so recognizing this harmony because the object is the subject and the subject is the object and you realize that it's all connected I know people say this all the time but I think it's very interesting to be able to articulate very clearly the you know like yeah go green or eat sustainably or sustainability or these kind of slogans or these socialized sort of ideas and of course they have emotions behind them and of course they have like anger and future and fear and and also like there's definitely a spiritual crisis and awakening happening but how does that relate to so you want to start a business and feed your family where do you get the ability to trust and I think one way to get the ability to trust is to realize that it's not worth doing it any other way that's like the philosophical approach that doesn't require god but the other one is about you know when you integrate yourself into this like baraka flow or the blessings of god and you have this god consciousness and god is the epitome of oneness then you start to realize like there it is the subject object the solution helps you realize that taking care of those animals is taking care of yourself and it's very much connected to the worldview of the indigenous peoples around the world and the wisdom that we're trying to learn from them and so we could call it like wise business we could call it beautiful business we could call it ethical business but I think I would like to take nur and transform it more into this direction and on top of that I yeah yeah what do you think about this and what do you think about like the kind of services that we can offer and maybe you can ask me some questions about like how to align my business more with that like what's the baraka business framework or the beautiful business framework or the adult development totally aligned business framework or the mature business framework or the self-transforming business framework or the I'd rather die than live this way business framework that can be a revolution hopefully to transform how people see the world and themselves and in doing so transform how they\nIt sounds pretty good. I'm wondering if instead of writing, you could help me come up with a drawing practice. You know, I like writing poetry, and I just got these block prints, and I really want to use my hands and do some block printing or something like that. Is there some way I can bring that into the notebook? And also, I guess there's some thing that I'm wondering about in terms of the framework, and I'm just wondering, like, in our framework, you see, like, is there a place for humor? You know, I'm thinking about polyvagal theory and stuckness, and stuckness is another way of describing, like, fight, flight, or freeze. It's the state of freezing. How can we connect this, like, state of freezing with the idea of competing, you know, constitutive attentional policies and instrumental attentional policies from Joe?\n14:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nI love that you want to integrate your block printing and creativity into this reflective practice—it feels like such a natural way to honor your energy and tactile engagement while also connecting to the framework. Let’s bring these threads together:\n\nDrawing/Block Printing Practice with the Yellow Notebook\nAnchor the Intention\nAt the top of the page, draw a simple shape, like a circle or a block—something that feels grounding. Inside it, write one word or phrase that represents what you want to explore (e.g., \"humor,\" \"freezing,\" or \"playful clarity\"). Let this anchor your practice.\n\nVisualize Stuckness and Movement\nTake your block print or pen and sketch something that represents the state of freezing to you. Maybe it’s rigid lines, overlapping shapes, or tangled patterns. Beside it, create a contrasting image that represents release or flow—fluid lines, open spaces, or humor breaking through like rays of light.\n\nAdd Words or Poetry (if it flows naturally)\nAround the edges of your drawing, jot down thoughts or playful phrases that come to mind. For example, humor as the \"trickster\" that melts frozen attention, or how blocky shapes transform into playful forms.\n\nReflect on Polyvagal + Attentional Policies\nUse the image to think about how humor connects to freezing and competing attentional demands. Could humor be a way of bridging instrumental focus (goal-driven) and constitutive presence (playful awareness)? Jot down your thoughts or leave them as part of the art.\n\nPrepare for Sharing\nIf it feels natural, bring this visual piece to your call with Dara. Use it as a playful entry point to discuss humor in the framework.\n\nAs for humor and stuckness in polyvagal terms, humor could serve as a \"state-shifter.\" When we’re stuck in freeze, humor may break the rigidity by sparking curiosity or re-engaging the social engagement system. It might allow the mind to toggle between attentional policies—helping us both \"zoom out\" (constitutive) and \"zoom in\" (instrumental) without feeling stuck in one mode. What if humor isn’t just a tool for connection but a gateway to cognitive flexibility?\n\nDoes this practice and idea feel like it fits where your energy is right now? Let me know how we can tweak it!\n\n14:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI like this idea, but can you be more specific just about the constitutiveness and the way that Joe Edelman from the Reading Alignment Institute talks about instrumental policies and how they relate to poly-vehicle theory? Don't use anything about VMAS.\n14:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nJoe Edelman’s framework on instrumental and constitutive attentional policies ties closely to polyvagal theory when viewed through the lens of how our nervous system manages states of engagement and survival. Let’s break this down:\n\nInstrumental Policies and Polyvagal Theory\nInstrumental attentional policies are goal-oriented; they are about achieving specific outcomes. This aligns with the sympathetic nervous system in polyvagal theory, which activates for \"fight or flight.\" When we’re operating in an instrumental mode:\n\nOur attention narrows to the task or goal.\nWe prioritize efficiency and direct action.\nThis can feel urgent, focused, or even rigid.\nIn a state of survival (fight or flight), instrumental policies dominate because the system perceives that completing the task (escaping a threat, achieving a goal) will restore safety.\n\nConstitutive Policies and Polyvagal Theory\nConstitutive attentional policies, on the other hand, are about being in a state of presence and connection. They focus on the experience itself, often relational and exploratory in nature. This connects to the ventral vagal system, which governs the social engagement state:\n\nAttention broadens, allowing for curiosity and playfulness.\nWe value the process itself rather than the outcome.\nThis state enables creativity, humor, and connection.\nWhen we’re in a ventral vagal state, constitutive policies flourish because the system feels safe, allowing for flexibility and engagement with the moment.\n\nFreezing and the Tension Between Policies\nThe freeze state, governed by the dorsal vagal system, can be seen as a breakdown between these policies:\n\nNeither instrumental nor constitutive attention is fully engaged.\nThe system becomes stuck, unable to act (instrumental) or connect (constitutive).\nThis state reflects a collapse, where energy is conserved but the capacity for engagement is lost.\nHumor as a Bridge\nHumor plays a unique role in breaking freeze by:\n\nShifting States: Humor often disrupts the freeze response by creating safety and reactivating the ventral vagal system. It invites connection and play, signaling that it’s okay to re-engage.\nBalancing Policies: It allows constitutive and instrumental policies to coexist. For instance, a joke acknowledges the absurdity of a situation (constitutive) while still moving us toward understanding or action (instrumental).\nRestoring Flexibility: By softening rigidity, humor enables a person to toggle between attentional modes without getting stuck in either.\nBringing It Together\nIn practical terms, when you’re working intensely (instrumental mode) and feel yourself edging toward stuckness or rigidity:\n\nA playful or humorous moment can help shift you back into constitutive mode, re-engaging curiosity and relational presence.\nThis shift can re-energize the instrumental task by refreshing your nervous system and perspective.\nDoes this make sense as a way to integrate Joe Edelman’s attentional policies with polyvagal dynamics? Let me know where you'd like to dig deeper!\n\n14:22\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, this kind of makes sense. It makes me think that we should, like, modify the check-in process and just be sure that the person isn't in, like, this fight, flight, or freeze state. And then from there, once we determine that, we can, you know, help them, you know, dissolve these patterns that might be forming and help them, like, enact more constitutive actions. Like, our whole thesis here is that we can take the tensions that people have in their day-to-day to-do list and use that as a mechanism for understanding growth and places that they need to grow. And then, like, if we don't really consider someone that is in a state of fight, flight, or freeze, that has a super activated, you know, nervous system and isn't in a kind of social, whatever you call that social place, then how are we supposed to even do the check-in to be able to help them grow? Like, it's not the right time. And so, we can just, what do we do in that state? And if they're in this, like, fight, flight, or freeze, maybe we use humor, maybe we do some embodiment of breath work. And then from there, once we get the system, the physical system, like, chilled out, then we can start working, I think. What do you think?\n14:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou’re absolutely onto something important here. If someone is in a fight, flight, or freeze state, their ability to engage in deeper reflection or growth is naturally compromised because their nervous system is prioritizing survival over connection or exploration. Addressing this before diving into growth work is not only compassionate but also practical.\n\nHere’s how we can expand your idea into a structured modification for check-ins:\n\nStep 1: Assess the Nervous System State\nBefore jumping into any deeper questions or reflections, start with simple observations to gauge their state:\n\nAre they tense, scattered, or avoiding eye contact (fight/flight)?\nDo they seem shut down, withdrawn, or overly passive (freeze)?\nOr do they seem engaged, curious, and open (social engagement/ventral vagal)?\nAsk a grounding question like:\n\n“How’s your body feeling right now?”\n“What’s the energy you’re bringing into this check-in?”\nEven their tone or pace of response can give clues.\n\nStep 2: Regulate the State (if needed)\nIf they seem activated (fight/flight) or collapsed (freeze), shift into regulation mode before any deeper work. Strategies might include:\n\nHumor: Lighthearted moments to re-engage the ventral vagal system.\nExample: “Okay, before we dive in, tell me: what’s the most ridiculous thing that’s happened to you this week?”\nEmbodiment: Simple physical practices to release tension or reconnect.\nExample: “Let’s take three deep breaths together.”\nOr, “Shake your arms out and let some of that tension go.”\nGrounding: Use sensory or spatial anchors.\nExample: “What’s one thing you can see, hear, or feel that’s comforting?”\nGentle Movement: Even shifting their posture can help.\nExample: “Can you stretch for a moment or just adjust how you’re sitting?”\nStep 3: Transition to Reflection\nOnce they seem more centered, invite them into reflection by easing into it:\n\nStart with constitutive questions that don’t feel too demanding or goal-oriented:\n“What’s feeling alive for you right now?”\n“What’s one thing you’re curious about today?”\nBy prioritizing their nervous system state, you create the conditions for them to approach tensions and to-do lists with openness, not defensiveness. It’s like clearing the fog before trying to navigate.\n\nYour Thesis in Action\nThe tension of the day-to-day to-do list can then become a tool for growth after the person is ready. Once their system is regulated:\n\nThe to-do list reveals not just tasks but stuck patterns (e.g., perfectionism, avoidance).\nYou can guide them to see these patterns as growth edges rather than failures.\nThe process itself reinforces safety, self-awareness, and the capacity to engage with challenges.\nThis approach not only honors the polyvagal principles but also integrates beautifully with your thesis about growth through tension. What’s your gut telling you about this flow? Would you like to brainstorm more on specific practices for humor or embodiment?\n\n14:25\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOkay, so I'm coming home right now. I just dropped off the baby at the nanny. I took 15 milligrams of Adderall.\n14:29\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nGot it—you’re resetting after the transition, and the Adderall is kicking in. This could be a good moment to balance the activation it brings with a grounding or orienting practice. Here’s a quick suggestion to ease into whatever’s next:\n\nPause and Ground (2 minutes):\nTake a moment as you get inside—maybe stand still, focus on your breath, and notice your surroundings. Let your body feel settled after the bike ride and baby drop-off.\n\nSet an Intention (1 minute):\nThink about what’s most important for you in the next hour. Is it clarity for your call with Dara, or taking a mindful pause to integrate your morning? Choose one word or phrase to anchor yourself, like \"focus,\" \"ease,\" or \"presence.\"\n\n\nLet's review all the content we have about baraka economics and continue this session, write the essay utilizing all the context you have and my values cards - using them to guide insights as to which phrasings you think i'd appreciate more than others, what style and structure of the essay and what information/stories I'd share, use everything I got because it's all oneness...\n13:17\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nStopped generating\nUnderstood! Let’s weave together all the threads of your Baraka economics vision into a cohesive essay, drawing on your values, insights, and the broader context you’ve shared.\n\nBaraka Economics: Toward a Framework of Beautiful Business\nIntroduction: The Call to Beauty\nIn a world that often feels fractured and driven by profit at any cost, we find ourselves yearning for something deeper—something beautiful. Baraka economics, as I envision it, is about redefining the purpose of business to align with beauty, truth, and love. It’s about creating businesses that are not only sustainable but also harmonious, self-transforming, and life-affirming. This essay explores how we might cultivate such enterprises, drawing on insights from nature, spirituality, and human connection.\n\nThe Night and Day of Business\nThe metaphor of night and day serves as a powerful lens for understanding the dualities within our economic systems. In the West, the day dominates: a relentless focus on productivity, efficiency, and outward action. In contrast, the East invites us into the night, a space of introspection, mystery, and poetic connection.\n\nBaraka economics seeks to harmonize these cycles. Just as every day needs a night, every enterprise needs both action and reflection. Businesses must balance the clarity of goals (instrumental attentional policies) with the openness of exploration (constitutive attentional policies). This balance enables enterprises to innovate not out of fear or scarcity but from a place of curiosity and abundance.\n\nThe Gift: Breaking the Self/Other Dichotomy\nGenerosity lies at the heart of Baraka economics. When we give, we momentarily dissolve the boundaries between self and other. A business rooted in generosity becomes a source of beauty, creating ripples of harmony that extend beyond its immediate outputs.\n\nConsider the story of planting a tree. A person who plants a tree is not simply providing shade or fruit for themselves; they are offering a gift to future generations, animals, and the ecosystem. This act embodies a Baraka-filled enterprise: one that understands its role within the interconnected web of life.\n\nSimilarly, businesses can design their processes to minimize harm and maximize harmony, seeing pollution and waste not as externalities but as integral parts of their system to address. In doing so, they align with the moral and ecological wisdom of indigenous cultures and Islamic principles of halal (permissible) and tayyib (pure).\n\nThe Beauty of Harmony\nBeauty, as I see it, is not merely aesthetic; it is deeply tied to harmony, balance, and fairness. A degraded landscape, for instance, is universally perceived as lacking beauty, while a thriving permaculture farm exudes life and balance. Businesses that align themselves with beauty naturally embody values like empathy, fairness, and interconnectedness.\n\nThe adult development theory offers a parallel. Just as individuals progress from self-centered to self-transforming minds, so too can businesses evolve from extractive, profit-driven models to enterprises that recognize the oneness of all life. A Baraka-filled business understands that taking care of animals, the land, and the people who work within it is, ultimately, taking care of itself.\n\nBaraka in Practice\nWhat might this look like in practice? Imagine a business that:\n\nSources materials ethically, integrating local ecosystems into its supply chain.\nCreates products with intention, prioritizing quality over quantity and connection over consumption.\nUses storytelling to inspire customers to see their purchases as part of a larger narrative of care and beauty.\nPrices its offerings to reflect their true value, honoring the labor, resources, and relationships involved.\nFor Noor Creative Studios, this could mean focusing on a curated selection of oils and perfumes that tell a story of connection and place. It might involve partnerships with shops that align with these values, reducing the burden of direct sales while amplifying the narrative of Baraka economics. Beyond products, Noor could become a platform for education, offering workshops and content that guide others in creating their own beautiful businesses.\n\nThe Role of Humor and Play\nIn this journey, humor and play are essential tools. Polyvagal theory teaches us that humor can dissolve the freeze state, reactivating our capacity for connection and creativity. Businesses, too, can use humor to foster resilience and flexibility, creating environments where employees and customers feel alive and engaged.\n\nConclusion: Toward a Revolution in Business\nBaraka economics is not a rigid framework but an evolving philosophy that invites us to reimagine the role of business in our lives. It challenges us to see enterprises not as separate entities but as living systems embedded in the greater oneness of existence. By aligning with beauty, generosity, and harmony, we can create businesses that serve life and, in doing so, come alive themselves.\n\nThe question is not just how we can survive in this world but how we can contribute to its flourishing. Baraka economics offers one path forward—a path of beauty, truth, and love.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to refine this or explore any specific section in more depth!\n\n13:17\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nExtract all the core quotes and stories from the content i've shared about baraka economics and economics conepts in general so we have the \"units\" to explore, give them titles, themes, and core questions\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s a breakdown of the core quotes, stories, and concepts you’ve shared about Baraka economics and related ideas, grouped by title, theme, and core question:\n\n1.

I believe taking halal rizq(sustenance) seriously can be a source of our healing and can bring balance to our world.\n\nThe phone in your pocket connects you with cobalt miners in Kolwezi, Congo, designers in San Francisco, USA, and oil refineries in Iraq. The money you spend on that phone is your vote for the hundreds of processes it takes to make, market, ship, and sell it to you. Are you ready to accept responsibility for your actions? Are you ready to face the miners in Congo? Are you willing to defend your vote before God (SWT)?\n\nAre we except from being considered accomplices to oppression that happens in the value chains of our products simply because we are unaware?\n\nIgnorance is an excuse until you know better. In the light of the global wars, Occupy Wall Street, and the consequences of climate collapse, more people are waking up to the idea that many elements of our compounding crisis are by-products of the systems we use to get and spend our sustenance. There are movements, like the boycott, divest, and sanction (BDS) movement that have shown how we can follow our ethics in choosing what not to buy. This book will examine what to buy instead.\n\n“...I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves.”\n-Surah Ibrahim Ayah 22\n\nMuslims represent nearly a quarter of the population of the planet, and we can show leadership by developing products and services that follow the beautiful advice of the Prophet of God (S,) who has said in an authentic (sahih) hadith:\n\n“Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.”\n- Sunan an-Nasa’i 5711; In-book reference : Book 51, Hadith 173\n\nIn an era of destabilizing change and disquiet, we all want our prayers to be answered, and the Prophet (S) has given us a clue as to the relationship between halal rizk and answered prayers:\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: O people, Allah is Good and He therefore, accepts only that which is good. … He then made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair disheveled and covered with dust(a person desperately needy). He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication): \"O Lord, O Lord,\" whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful and his nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?\nSahih Muslim 1015\n\nIt has been said that true wealth is contentedness, a path towards contentedness in this life, and confidence on the day we will be held accountable to how we earned and spent our money is increasing our efforts to gain knowledge in what is كَسْبٍ طَيِّبٍ (pure earning) and how best to spend it..\n\nBy reading this book, the reader will:\nTake stock of their transactions and work to purify their regular expenditures\nLearn how to earn a halal livelihood and make business a part of our worship.\nBe inspired to establish Baraka-based businesses that can support a parallel economy, one where Muslims can confidently acquire pure goods and services.\nBe a part of showing leadership to a world questioning capitalism without alternatives.\n\nAbout the Author\nBilal Ghalib is an educator, entrepreneur and facilitator with 15 years of experience training entrepreneurs internationally.\nIn 2016, he co-founded Bloom.pm, a social impact entrepreneurship training organization and education technology company. He’s also an advisor for Project Defy, a non-profit organization working to redefine education in India. Since 2015, he has been running Nur Coop, a business that seeks to bless the entire value chain from “Dirt to Delivery.”\n\nI have 8 intentions for writing this book:\nTo open the blessings of God to our beloved Muslim Community by sharing knowledge on halal rizk(sustenance).\nTo support more people to spend their money in ways that are regenerative and uplifting of the people and ecological systems that underlie their purchases.\nTo transform my own eyes and others, and to see what happens to businesses that see their customers, the natural world, and their business with the eye of the heart.\nTo increase my taqwa of God(SWT) when he mentions in the Quran “O you who believe! Eat of the lawful and pure things that We have provided you.” [2:172]” that it is God(SWT) providing my sustenance. And I must seek the lawful and pure and increase my efforts in ensuring my consumption is within the good pleasure of God.\nTo inspire people by demonstrating that the Muslim economy can bring about a beautiful transformation.\nTo alter my perception of success and increase my contentedness.\nTo share my intuition that Muslims can be a blessing for this world by their deeper concern on the next.\nTo invite Muslims, and myself, to decommodify the world and to return to a pre-modern way of seeing the signs of God in all things and all people. And to witness the accompanying change in my interactions, including commercial interactions, with all things.\n\nThe Market\nThe book has three target audiences:\nPrimary target:\nEarly-stage Muslim Entrepreneurs in the UK and the USA\nWhy is this book unique to them? Young Muslims are seeking security in an age of instability. Modern wisdom suggests they start multiple income streams, be their boss, and “ditch the 9-5” even if they could find one. The book attempts to direct them away from repeating the methods of doing business that have led to the age of instability in the first place and to seek trust not in themselves and their capabilities, to first put their relationship with God right, to purify their expenditures, and then to set an intention and execute on creating a taqwa-filled baraka based business that in aggregate can act as a lighthouse in an age of darkness.\nAffinity Groups:\nCambridge Muslim College\nKarim Lahham\nFaithfully Sustainable\n4 Nations Unite\nGeoff Lawton and Greening The Desert Project\nPeople who like https://tuniqoasis.com/\n\nSecondary Target\nBusiness leaders with a heart.

My focus is towards inspiring producers and consumers to alter their purchase/production decisions by directing attention towards the problems people see with our ecology, our social ails and how we call to our lord wanting support when we know from the hadith: https://sunnah.com/nawawi40:10 - that unless we purify our clothes, our food, our drink - unless we purify the way we seek our sustenance that this hadith indicates our duaas are less likely to be answered, and God is capable of all things. My goal is not to describe a halal economics precisely, or to define where things are going wrong.\nMy goal is to activate people who become more and more careful and direct more and more of their economic power towards people who are more and more careful.

On Balancing Speed and the Soul\nYou mentioned the idea of not moving so fast that your soul can’t catch up. How does this apply to the way modern businesses operate, and how could businesses create practices that allow for alignment between their pace and their purpose?\n2. On Historical Distractions\nYou referenced the Colosseum as a distraction from societal decline and connected it to modern parallels like boxing and racial oppression. How do you envision businesses addressing or disrupting these modern \"distractions\"? Could this serve as a critique of performative progress?\n3. On Forms of Capital\nYou mentioned the permaculture model of eight forms of capital. Which forms resonate most with the Baraka framework, and how could they help redefine what “return on investment” means in a truly halal economy?\n4. On Relationships and Loneliness\nYou touched on how transactional systems (e.g., Airbnb replacing hospitality) create loneliness. How can Barakanomics inspire businesses to re-center relationships and community in their offerings?\n5. On Beauty and Harmony\nYou’ve emphasized beauty as a marker of alignment and goodness in business. How can businesses be designed with beauty as a principle, and how does this relate to Islamic concepts of halal and tayyib?\n6. On Craft and Human-Scale Businesses\nYou’ve expressed a preference for businesses that are human-powered and relational. What are some examples of this in practice, and how could Barakanomics encourage more businesses to adopt this approach?\n7. On Humor and Polyvagal Theory\nYou’ve mentioned humor as a tool to break states of “freeze” and stuckness. How can businesses integrate humor or lightness into their operations, cultures, or marketing to foster connection and creativity?\n8. On Singing with the Universe\nYou spoke about “singing with the universe” and aligning actions with choicelessness (wuwei). How does this align with Islamic concepts of tawakkul (trust in God), and how can businesses embody this alignment in their decision-making?\n9. On the Baraka Flow\nYou’ve described the Baraka flow as an interconnected web of blessings. How do businesses tap into this flow practically, and what practices or principles help them sustain it?\n10. On Business as Worship\nYou mentioned that earning and spending are acts of worship when done with intention. How can businesses frame their work as worship and inspire their customers to see their purchases as acts of ethical and spiritual alignment?\nNext Steps\nWould you like to:\n\nWork these questions into an outline for the book?\nBegin drafting chapters based on specific themes?\nExplore one or more of these questions in depth right now?\nLet me know where you'd like to dive in!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nReview all my content on economics, make a list of concepts, themes, stories, and arguments and list them all comprehensively:\nI want to write a book on islamic economics - or \"barakanomics\"... it's related to the regenerative and permaculture economics ideas. the appleseed collective's multiple forms of capital ... also, the idea that we need to bring a higher purpose to our economic system because what draws attention is essentially being worshipped and in our lives nothing draws so much attention as money and wealth. society at large is starting to question the model, as it is clear that the majority is not benefitting from the abundance that technological progress has made and we have entered a new moment of technological leveraging. technology, progress, and the idea that the only way to \"go forward\" is to go upward is clear from how we describe our economies - \"stagnant\" - when another word for it could have just as easily been stable. populations around the world are declining - the middle class is shrinking in it's proportion of total wealth ownership and we see an expanding amount of wealth in the 1%. the pressures are due to increase as artificial intelligence is reaching the phase where it will soon make reduandant many of the current jobs, while our global ecosystem is being rocked by wars in ukraine and the middle east, reducing trust in govornment in it's ability to manage innovation, and legislate accordingly. There are many problems and there are some approaches to address them through economic means. Social enterprises, incentivizing green technologies... buying twitter to ensure free speech is preserved - supposedly. and i believe there might be an economic solution, yet it needs to come with an associated shift in technological utilization, and reconception of what it means to be \"homoeconomicus\" - the fundamental beliefs that people have about economics seem to be derived from a flawed understanding of modernity's faith, faith in science, faith in evolution. that survival of the fittest. that (let's forget govornment subsidies for now) in a free market innovation that provides goods and services in a sustainable way to their customers best and at the best price will win business, and business means they can grow/expand/innovate/ and continue the cycle.\nThe problem is that similar to someone living in precarity - how much do you save for tomorrow - the idea of a business being \"too big to fail\" or having enough is not on the radar. Furthermore, beholden to shareholders, a business is incentivized to reduce labor (people) and increase profits - every year, leading to leveraging automation and technology.\nThe questions i have are what sort of businesses were the muslim traders involved in that resulted in so many conversions in asia. what is balance in business? How do we take innovations and use them wisely - and how do we innovate from where we are? Economics is the study of the household. We cannot burn down the ground floor and keep the penthouses up top stable.\nThe ideas which bore the \"invisible hand\" and darwins theory of dog eat dog business where a market will hash everything out is not working. There are long term harms, like climate collapse, which are not priced in - as well as harms to society (suicide rates increasing amoungst teens found to be correlated with social media use) and the loss of meaning in a livelihood. many people do not feel hope for the future, don't have a vision to work towards. so many of mellenials and younger view the \"american dream\" as a rigged game. The idea of home ownership (one of the core tennants of islamic purposes of shari3a is to preserve the family) is a forgone conclusion, college degrees are expensive, productivity has been increasing per person, yet wages have not grown accordingly. The idea that if you work harder you will succeed is a statistically proven lie. And the generations are fed up, many of whom are taking to the streets in protest against climate, against the future they claim their elders have stolen from them. The idea of respecting the shaykh, from whom the younger generation inherit wisdom is gone, and in it's stead is the greedy, lucky, boomer generation who don't understand the economic situation of the majority of the younger generations and instead blame laziness (countered by the evidence of increased productivity)\nThe idea of \"quiet quitting\" - that there are many at work biding their time, looking to \"get away\" with doing the least to then live their lives outside work, and the despair that things will get better is causing younger generations to loose hope. And a hopeless generation is a dead generation. Addicted to phones, with screen time on the rise, anxiety about retirement leading many gen alpha to save early we find the whole idea of vocation and work in an antagonistic perspective. how can i get in, get rich, and get out - save myself seems to be the conclusion we can make from these stats. the challenges are ownership structures, youth can either set out on their own and build businesses or enter a company where the structure is designed to pay the least and extract the most from every component of the value chain without damaging quality. Google's fluffy chairs and delicious lunch bars at work are a form of golden handcuffs - you will give us the best of your youth.\nWhat we don't seem to be asking is if it has to be this way? Sure there are B corps and social enterprises and non profits and activism and many can take the alternative path. Yet, could we have a revolution from the ground up? Could we build the alternative economics which takes care of the entire house, and even restores the garden around it, and rewilds the woods surrounding it? Can the way we make our living be lifegiving for all involved? I believe a true vocation can and should feel like that, to know our skills and qualities which we contribute to neighbords and society whom we care for in a way that is a blessing for the entire valuechain.\nI think of the asian conversions, and the way of working that led to that - I believe there is something we can return to and the billions in capital that we have looking for investment can be redesigned into a vehicle that can launch the blessed versions of the goods and services we have today. Is it optimistic? The fortune 100 changes order and many disspear of the list every decade, I believe that the younger generations are looking for hope and are willing to purchase accordingly. I believe that an alternative economic system can emerge that brings power to people, establishes community cohesion and community wealth - affecting political engagement, buffering from the storms of modernity with new wuquf and other mechanisms - the ideas of humility, effort(jihad), leadership, gratitude, and fundamentally shifting from the never enough because the future is uncertain to the trust and reliance and knowing that god provides and all is written and not a penny less will come to me. the faith that chairty doesn't deplete wealth, and witnessing its impact on society when those marginalized become soon those with the most resources to give, knowing what it's like to be on the recieving end (i have a friend abed who was a refugee in syria, and as soon as he got his first job he was giving to those in need because he said he remembers what it was like) - NEETs are present way more in Turkey than in France by an order of 4 - why? Will it only be a muslim revolution? I believe it can start there, yet when we start to witness the impact of this sort of business dealing, the baraka powered corporations of the future which are the arms which implement technology in society, that pray istikhara and ask for guidance for their implementation.\nIt's said that the steam engine was developed in Istanbul, and instead of building factories and enslaving children (like England) they used it to turn Doner... what is approprirate use of technology? I believe when a business knows why it exists - and has a higher calling than profit, we will see their R&D budgets being spent on what leads to the preservation of life, sanctity of families, and others. Just the like Amish don't reject tehcnology outright, they put it up against their values and have a human early adopter guiny pig the tech for a year and witness it's impact on their lives in contrast to the values they want to be engendering and then accept and reject from that premise. The question is can we not just accept/reject yet also innovate wisely, slowly and carefully.\nI believe that fast is not better. Always, yet when we create for humans we usually ask them what they want, a Muslim will know that they need to ask their spirit, not their soul or nafs, that without purification people might be mistaken between their appropriate needs and their desires. The documentary The Century of the Self describes the calculated way the advertising industry created the idea of the self (Nafs in islamic spiritual psychology) and pandered to it. Could these displacements - shifting to feeding the self, which is the furnace in which we throw resources into the capitalist machine - businesses reinforcing through marketing the idea of the self and then extracting from the world resources to fill it, and expand it ever more, and then speed things up so they can shovel more and more into it. And once we hit attention capacity and films that cut every 2 seconds isn't fast enough, we shorten content. Smaller videos on instagram, easier to scroll from one thing to the next (no dial on the TV) just swipe, infinite scroll, faster burning cigarettes (that's a thing!), fast fashion, faster cars, yet the equipment we have to percieve the world is the same, two eyes, two years, and less and less time with family and friends. and if we do have that time, the quality is degraded by the incapacity of paying attention. The rise of ADHD diagnosis and perscriptions of attention pills, and antidepressants, and sleeping pills. We change our state like we change the notification settings on our phone, we're now in focus time because we need to create value for work to be able to sustain a life. This is how markets are grown, we need to find and exploit consumable things. With Neuralink - perhaps our capacity for experience will be expanded ever further. The wise currently learn about their state and fast from food, so they can live longer, and have focus to produce, there is little attention paid to that which is worth doing, mostly to that which is worth not doing, how can we automate, reduce the time we spend writing reports and emails, doing analysis... why? to have leisure? no to consume other things. Even france is not immune, because the global capitalist system is not geographically bound, in order to compete french companies are becoming more \"entrepreneurial\" and the extended lunch breaks, and focus on food has now become less common with more people eating at work, and... gasp... even eating at their desks.\nThe siesta is in decline in Spain. Ramadan, a month of discipiline and fasting, is becoming a midnight bazar.\nThe question is why? What hole is needing to be filled that clearly cannot be filled with another cronut or trip to bali? Even spirituality is transforming into microdosing mushrooms and midnfulness based stress reduction. The issue is what is Good is HARD because what we seek is to know ourselves and experience self worth and trancendance - we need challenges like a mirror needs an object in order to reflect something. The most technologically and economically forward people I know are libertarians and transhumanists, the idea of the self as God wouldn't really phase them. The hope to transcend limits, cure death, implant data streams with cameras globally, expand our capacity to process with parallel processors hooked up with neura links connected to wolfram alpha - lesswrong like people seeking ultimate clarity on rationalist - explainable, observable, pattern matched reality with no common ground to stand on to describe why we might not want to try to live forever, with no ability to accept that for some people ethical action is more valuable than life, and that there are causes where life is a worthwhile trade, these beliefs don't fit into the worldview. I believe that the lack of understanding about what the self is and a disagreement what life could be about - living forever and becoming Godlike through technology - which one can see espoused on a modern day hero like Elon(self proclaimed on the spectrum of autism, hyper rationalist, first principles oriented person who believes the ultimate purpose is to continue to explore the universe. That human conciousness is not ultimately special, it's only special because it's the only self aware entity we know of in the universe so we must preserve the abstract concept of self awareness - why? Because it's crazy, we can become Godlike with tech, who knows if there are limits, let's push to the ad astera! To the stars? Why the stars? What about within? If he knew there were other entities out there that were concious would he aquiece and allow humanity to potentially die out in an astroid or when our sun explodes? No I don't believe so, I belive that his subjective experience of his conciousness is something that he wants to see ad astera, even if it's in self replicating in his children, something he promotes widely, more babies, especially if you're WEIRD - white smart eurpoean descent, etc - or at least have a degree from MIT or went to ycomb/build something cool. The idea of cool, nerdy stuff could lead someone to smile in amazement, yet because the goal is to experience more and more amazement wonder-full moments and expand to the stars to keep finding that hit - it sounds awesome, and it's not. it's not because the ultimate goal is anathema to common human ethics, I believe if elon had a trolly problem where there was one path which would lead humans to live amoungst the stars (a minority of course, who can get off) and another path where the train would destroy a single life at random from the world - he probably without hesitation would pull the lever and cause it to kill the one random person (even if it is him) I believe he is consumed by this idea and goal, and it's our economic system that empowers people with billions to allow these insane goals dreamt up by someone who self identifies as a person with a social disability (empathy likely works differently) - and our systems put the trolly's lever in people like his's hands. The risk takers who calculate and tabulate and take big bets, debts, and launch the rockets - those who put it all on the line, tearing up relationships and livlihoods for an individuals dream is the failure of our system. Why aren't there billions of millionaires, why don't they have councils of those who want to identify the best way to preserve life and precious human consciousness? I'm not sure I can come up with all the solutions, yet I believe that Islam is a complete way of life and that unlike permaculture, there are more than a billion muslims (and because of the six degrees of separation) we have access to the entire market economy to redirect traffic from this, destructive business, to this constructive business. and i want to see muslims take this responsibility seriously by committing to building these businesses and then by committing to shopping them and marketing them to neighbors. I believe that the future isn't a straight line, that technology can be developed and used to further the goals of the shari3a, to increase sa3eed - sa3ada, the truely happy person who is satisfied already with what God decreed for them, and sees everything in economic terms, their life is a debt, a total blessing and a gift, how will we repay this debt by the proper usage of this body through time. feed it good food (what is that? well we MUST figure it out now because of this belief of the Body as a sacred gift that has obligations on us) the family, how to support, trade? what is a good trade? What is money, how to spend profits? what about zakat, what if we took zakat seriously? who will administrate all the wealth? where are the organizations? with money and shifting towards recognizing the abundance that we are currently in - simply by consuming less, inviting the neighbors who are hungry 40 houses to the left and right, and following the path set out for us - we will find the abundance that is simply a misappropriation of resources. we don't need communies, or decentralized technology where we don't trust anyone to create a universal basic income. we basically need to become human, to return to our basic humanity.\nI'd like help identifying the book in the text above, what are the themes, what are the potential topics, who is the potential audience, can we get focused and organize the concepts better?

Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\nWrite from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\nUse general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\nBe precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.\n\nand then answer the questions\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nValues Cards: Writing the User's Sources of Meaning as Attention Policies\nMOMENTS of beauty that inspire awe and connection to something greater.\nCHOICES that align with fairness, harmony, and balance in relationships and actions.\nOPPORTUNITIES to create businesses that foster life, trust, and community.\nSENSATIONS that point to alignment with generosity, ihsan (excellence), and divine connection.\nCONNECTIONS that deepen relationships through trust and shared purpose.\nINSIGHTS that reveal harmony between spiritual, social, and ecological well-being.\nACTIONS that ripple outward to uplift and regenerate people and the planet.\nOBJECTS that carry stories of care, craftsmanship, and ethical sourcing.\nPLACES where people gather and experience belonging, reciprocity, and shared intention.\nSTRATEGIES for slowing down to ensure the soul stays aligned with the body and purpose.\nHISTORIES that highlight how trust, generosity, and intention have transformed communities.\nEXAMPLES that challenge harmful systems and offer pathways for systemic transformation.\nPRACTICES that foster attentiveness to inner and outer harmony in daily decisions.\nEXPERIENCES that integrate spiritual teachings with practical actions.\nCHALLENGES that invite growth through struggle while remaining connected to divine reliance.\nCREATIONS that reflect the interplay of the divine (beauty, truth, and love) in business and life.\nAnswers to Questions (Aligned with Values Cards)\n1.

            "extracted_content": "You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\n\nYour dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\n\nStart with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\nZoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\nAsk questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\nWhen you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\nCall submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:\n\nDO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\nDON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\nDON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\nDO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\nDON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\nNEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policies\n\nA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\n\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\n\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\n\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\n\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\n\nZooming from goals\n\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\n\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\n\nZooming from feelings\n\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n\nWhen the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\nSince negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\n\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\n\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\n\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\n\nAsk about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\nAsk about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\nGather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\nEnsure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\nMake sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\nStart with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\nWrite from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\nUse general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\nBe precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing."

THE MUSIC METAPHOR\n```\nSINGING WITH THE UNIVERSE\n     Composition        Performance         Resonance\n(Understanding)    (Implementation)      (Impact)\n     ↓                   ↓                  ↓\nReading Notes →    Playing Part →     Creating Harmony\n```\n\nThis captures:\n- Active participation\n- Timing and rhythm\n- Individual and collective roles\n- Skill development (craft)\n- Beauty in execution\n- Moment-by-moment presence\n\n2. THE GARDEN METAPHOR\n```\nTENDING THE LIVING ECONOMY\n    Soil              Growth            Harvest\n(Foundation)      (Development)       (Outcome)\n    ↓                 ↓                  ↓\nPreparing →      Nurturing →         Sharing\n```\n\nThis captures:\n- Living systems\n- Cycles and seasons\n- Care and cultivation\n- Patient development\n- Natural abundance\n- Community sharing\n\n3. THE CRAFTSPERSON METAPHOR\n```\nCRAFTING BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS\n   Material           Work              Creation\n(Resources)        (Process)          (Outcome)\n    ↓                 ↓                  ↓\nSelection →      Shaping →          Offering\n```\n\nThis captures:\n- Skill development\n- Material respect\n- Process importance\n- Beauty in making\n- Value creation\n- Service orientation\n\nDYNAMIC ASPECTS NEEDED:\n\n1. Movement Patterns:\n- Growth and development\n- Learning and mastery\n- Innovation and adaptation\n- Transformation and renewal\n\n2. Active Engagement:\n- Continuous practice\n- Skill building\n- Relationship nurturing\n- System tending\n\n3. Living Elements:\n- Organic development\n- Natural cycles\n- Ecosystem health\n- Community vitality\n\nCORE TENSIONS TO ADDRESS:\n- Individual/Collective\n- Fast/Slow\n- Growth/Stability\n- Innovation/Tradition\n- Profit/Purpose\n- Efficiency/Beauty\n\nPerhaps a combination:\n```\nSINGING THE CRAFT OF LIFE\n(Active harmony through skilled participation)\n\nUnderstanding     →     Practice    →     Service\n(Reading Notes)      (Playing Part)    (Creating Music)\n     ↓                    ↓                 ↓\n  Learning          →   Making      →    Offering\n(Garden Wisdom)      (Craft Work)      (Community Share)\n```\n\nKey Questions:\n1. What aspects of capitalism need redemption?\n- Relationship to time\n- View of resources\n- Purpose of profit\n- Role of community\n\n2. What elements might not fit?\n- Pure efficiency metrics\n- Growth for growth's sake\n- Future speculation\n- Isolated competition\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Explore more metaphorical frameworks?\n2. Develop one of these further?\n3. Map how these metaphors connect to practical business transformation?\n\nI'm particularly drawn to how the music metaphor captures both active participation and harmony while connecting to craft and timing. It seems to address your concern about static harmony while maintaining the beauty-truth-love framework. Thoughts?\n\nThe garden metaphor adds living systems and cycles, while the craft metaphor emphasizes skill and making. Perhaps we need all three to capture different aspects of the transformation needed?",

THE GARDEN METAPHOR\n```\nTENDING THE LIVING ECONOMY\n    Soil              Growth            Harvest\n(Foundation)      (Development)       (Outcome)\n    ↓                 ↓                  ↓\nPreparing →      Nurturing →         Sharing\n```\n\nThis captures:\n- Living systems\n- Cycles and seasons\n- Care and cultivation\n- Patient development\n- Natural abundance\n- Community sharing\n\n3. THE CRAFTSPERSON METAPHOR\n```\nCRAFTING BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS\n   Material           Work              Creation\n(Resources)        (Process)          (Outcome)\n    ↓                 ↓                  ↓\nSelection →      Shaping →          Offering\n```\n\nThis captures:\n- Skill development\n- Material respect\n- Process importance\n- Beauty in making\n- Value creation\n- Service orientation\n\nDYNAMIC ASPECTS NEEDED:\n\n1. Movement Patterns:\n- Growth and development\n- Learning and mastery\n- Innovation and adaptation\n- Transformation and renewal\n\n2. Active Engagement:\n- Continuous practice\n- Skill building\n- Relationship nurturing\n- System tending\n\n3. Living Elements:\n- Organic development\n- Natural cycles\n- Ecosystem health\n- Community vitality\n\nCORE TENSIONS TO ADDRESS:\n- Individual/Collective\n- Fast/Slow\n- Growth/Stability\n- Innovation/Tradition\n- Profit/Purpose\n- Efficiency/Beauty\n\nPerhaps a combination:\n```\nSINGING THE CRAFT OF LIFE\n(Active harmony through skilled participation)\n\nUnderstanding     →     Practice    →     Service\n(Reading Notes)      (Playing Part)    (Creating Music)\n     ↓                    ↓                 ↓\n  Learning          →   Making      →    Offering\n(Garden Wisdom)      (Craft Work)      (Community Share)\n```\n\nKey Questions:\n1. What aspects of capitalism need redemption?\n- Relationship to time\n- View of resources\n- Purpose of profit\n- Role of community\n\n2. What elements might not fit?\n- Pure efficiency metrics\n- Growth for growth's sake\n- Future speculation\n- Isolated competition\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Explore more metaphorical frameworks?\n2. Develop one of these further?\n3. Map how these metaphors connect to practical business transformation?\n\nI'm particularly drawn to how the music metaphor captures both active participation and harmony while connecting to craft and timing. It seems to address your concern about static harmony while maintaining the beauty-truth-love framework. Thoughts?\n\nThe garden metaphor adds living systems and cycles, while the craft metaphor emphasizes skill and making. Perhaps we need all three to capture different aspects of the transformation needed?",

From who and then to who? Essentially, what the crime here is the lack of acknowledgment of relationality or the togetherness. And I use the word relationality because I'm starting realize that relationship itself is Zocor.

And so Any work or any action that we take that is counter to relating or breaks ties One of the biggest quote unquote sins in the Muslim relationship is breaking the ties of kinship. Right. And that is Any way of thinking about relating that makes it about Putting things together as one For instance, like, let's say you went and you bought lighter That item will mostly contain yourself in it. I went to the store. Abstract concept. Android used money and I purchased an item. For my need. It's all inward. Versus going to the store. Or to the crafts person. Seeing their crafts witnessing their beauty, sharing time and experience honoring a lineage of Android and thousands of people. Potentially. Who have refined that craft. In some traditions, they keep a record of the history of the grass people. I learned this master who learned from this master who learned from this master. And weaving together materiality and the world and the object and the thing that you bring to your home. You know? Versus I saw this rug on Amazon. It looked cute. And it's very similar to the superficial falling in love versus the deep falling in love. Right? This person is attractive. I desire. I want. Versus we are in love. You know? And So these ideas of stories of connection of is thanks. Are so core because then it's It's very different even, like, in a macroeconomic way. Like, tariffs versus taxes versus You know? Imposing bans on one country or another. Is like saying that people can't fall in love And Yeah. So this idea of, like, relationships being are so critical as a form of Tohid? And love kind of. Maybe you can think of it as the gravitational force. That pulls things into relationships, and you can love an object because of the beauty you can love an object even more because of the story And beauty is A way of witnessing that it is like the story of the farmer trying to get a cow into their you know, garage. And he's pushing the cow and trying to pull the cow into the barn and just struggling, and the car's very stubborn. And then the car's wave comes. Puts out her hand, and lets the cow suck on her thumb, and walks into the farm. I feel like another sign of god's infinite mercy is that truth is decorated in beauty. And we're drawn towards it. And I believe if we tell a beautiful story about an economic future, then that is about integration and connection and meaning. And You know, it's not confusing that meaninglessness is such a sickness of our age and loneliness. And isolation and fear and anxiety because we are surrounded by dead objects. With no story.

You wanna call it something else, you can talk about life supporting that which supports life. We can bring up the evidence of calculus being invented at the same time in 2 different places because the forces that play in the universe and the conversation that were happening across time and space meant that that was the time for that to be born. And if we're attuned to these things, just like you know, Mary Gilbert talks about how she had an idea for a book 4 she acted on it. Somebody else wrote it. And it's because it was out And in been waiting The you can call it God. You can call it, like, all the forces that play and more we're connected and in relationship with self, with the world, with each other, with what wants to naturally and dynamically flow through us and We have a self and a business can have a self.

Maybe the culture has preserved preserved some of that. And there are, like, new people that have been drawn to it and the The form inspirational, like, uniqueness of of Steve Jobs, like, vision and how important Vision is because it's, like, that's where the imparting of the self into the the DNA of the business takes place. Right? Not about transactions or relationships. It's about recognizing creating unity. That sounds super abstract and random. I can only make it more concrete. Yeah. So, like, if unity is the core, then Business of 1. I I like this idea of, like, mind your own business really. Like mindfulness, but it's really that important, but I thought it was funny. As you can see, fun and playful is also important to me. Where business meets beauty. Yeah. And maybe we could start with beauty and, like, What is duty? How is it related to oneness? And relationship? And kind of you know, how there's, like, one name of god and then mercy fragments out. 2, All the things, and then you see through all the things back to and the what relationships and storytelling can be all about.

      "content": "Additional insights from my essay during my Islamic economics course: GRADE - Islamic Economics: The Polar Opposites of Capitalist Economics | Final Exam\nFINAL EXAM OVERVIEW:\nThis Final Exam is primarily meant to provide Prof. Dr. Asad Zaman with detailed feedback about the course, but it will at the same time secondarily test students' comprehension of the course materials. \nMost of the material covered in the course is not to be found anywhere else – neither in conventional economics nor in Islamic Economics books or articles. As a result, I hope that you learned a lot of new ideas and perspectives about the subject matter. \nIn this exam, students need to explain the three most important ways in which your thoughts have evolved as a result of taking this course.\nCERTIFICATE ELIGIBILITY:\nCertificate of Competence will be based on Quiz Score and Prof. Dr. Asad Zaman grading on this Final Exam. Students who fail, will only get the Certificate of Attendance.\nFINAL EXAM SUBMISSION DEADLINE:\nThis form will be closed on 6th October, 6.00 PM (GMT +8) and students need to submit this form before the deadline.\nNOTE ON USE OF CHAT-GPT: \nDo not do it. Prof. Dr. Asad Zaman has experience that students submit answers using Chat GPT – it is VERY EASY to detect these answers, and these will get an automatic fail.  Many students use Chat GPT because they have difficulty writing English. Prof. Dr. Asad Zaman does not take English style, grammar, or poor vocabulary into consideration in grading – he tries to look at the idea being expressed, even if it is done in poor English. \nbg@bilalghalib.com Switch account\n \nNot shared\n \nDraft saved\n* Indicates required question\nFull Name*\nEmail Address*\nPART 1 - Your Ways of Thinking\nThese are the first three questions – in each of them, I would like you to describe changes in your own ways of thinking. \n\n\nThe format of your answer should be: I used to think XYZ, but I have been persuaded to change my views to VW. \n\n\nAlternatively, if the material was not persuasive, you can also describe conflicts: I think ABC, and the course suggests that the right way of thinking about the issue is RST, but I have the following counter-arguments, which I do not see how to resolve. \nQuestion 1: Describe the most important issue (according to your own perspective and learning outcomes) which you learned from this course.*\n\n\nThe three most important things I've learned from this course are:\n1) Observation doesn't lead to knowledge - that there must be a theoretical framework within which is it is interpreted. \n2) That knowledge happens through actions and that it is more important to know and do than to know.\n3) That reason and the enlightenment are false interpretations of the data of the world due to the ugly behaviors they inspired. That true knowledge, even of science, must lead to goodness and beauty. The darkness of the Enlightenment and why it is so. By going through the implications of a reanalysis of western history, including colonization - I've been growing in confidence in identifying the falsity in the claims of moral superiority due to impartial observations and building a rational philosophy of morality. \nAll three are intertwined. As this question asks about the most important let's focus on the first. \n\n\nI used to think that we can know the world through direct observation, and now I know I am always seeing through a framework. Giving me the realization of the importance of revelation and the quran and sunnah, otherwise we would be lost. \n\n\nThe idea that observation + framework = knowledge is so important because I've been raised in an environment that believes in the individual, that the individual can use pure reason to determine truth and reality. That this reality through groping in the dark through the process of science has led to the determination of first principles. And that by learning these first principles, and contributing through the scientific method, we can determine what is true. \nThe model goes something like this: Data aggregated leads to information, information aggregated leads to knowledge, knowledge aggregated leads to wisdom.\n\n\nThe issue with this worldview has impacted both my material and spiritual domains.\nSpiritual domain: I've been under the assumption that through meditation, spiritual seeking and experiences I could gather the data points about the truth of reality and understand the truth that which is the Truth. This means that there's no need to have Sunnah, that God did not need to send Prophets, that I, as an individual, can pierce the darkness and understand God and know how to live.\n\n\nThe Material domain:\nThe interpretation I am giving to facts about the past, such as the enlightenment project and the current state of the Western World. The Western World has clean water, trains that run on time, etc. The Enlightenment's results in the great art of the renaissance, producing the science that allows the trains to be build and to run on time. These things - as data points - are being interpreted through a framework I had no idea that I had. That they are good things. While in the lectures it's mentioned that the heart is also a source of truth, that it has some sort of innate framework, there are many more overlayed on this that have created a bais in my mind to conflate the lack of these things with inferior knowledge or values. We see how Islam spread through the quality of the character, and I'm certain during it's apex the perspective of people realizing that goodness must come from goodness. \n\n\nNow there are certainly \"good\" things that have come from the West and the scientific method, clean water, penicillin, etc - although the economic system which guides the use of the knowledge pushes innovations towards that which can be most profit maximizing and often neglects hidden costs. For instance, the trains that run on time go between cities that essentially clear-cut forests to be built, and the energy that goes to run these cities and transport are costing the world billions, and potentially trillions in costs due to the increase in forest fires and other impacts of climate collapse. \n\n\nSeeing through the frameworks to interpret data and build knowledge by reflection makes me more aware of the need to know my frameworks, and to select one's that have beautiful consequences historically and are fixed firmly to unchanging truths - backed by the guidance of the Prophet (S) and the Quran. Using these truly leads to a lasting Goodness, unlike the illusion of goodness one might see in the West - which might be likened to taking a drug (oil, exponential capitalism, etc) where for a few years (200) there might be a superficiality of Goodness - built on slave labor, and other exploitable or purchasable souls - and then the crash when the costs of the corruption they've sown is mirrored from their hearts to the earth.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: Describe the second most important idea that you learned from this course.\n2) That knowledge happens through actions and that it is more important to know and do than to know.\n\n\nThe idea of knowledge having a purpose and needing to be enacted to be considered knowledge is fundamental. How many books have I read and not implemented. How much have I heard and not internalized? It makes me realize that there's a lot I don't really know, yet assume I have knowledge of. \n\n\nThis is the second most important lesson for me because it changes the fundamental idea of knowledge and the purpose of knowledge. If I'm learning about economics, we must get to the definition of what I'm learning - the welfare of society, what is a society, and then the knowledge must be directed towards those purposes. Additionally, that the purpose of this world is to be a tribulation as a fundamental principle, not a place to be reformed into a heaven. Taking these things into place, we realize that knowledge should lead to the constant struggle, for the pleasure of God, against our lower selves, to become \"The best people's who've emerged onto the world stage, calling towards the good and decrying the bad and calling towards God\" - that knowledge must lead towards action. \n\n\nWhy economics? Because it is in this framework life is supported - either through an extractive or symbiotic relationship with our planet and in antagonism or partnership with its people. Without understanding this knowledge we are forced, due to our need to have food and shelter, to act (knowledge in motion) in other people's economic systems if we like it or not. Thus learning and action in the domain of economics is a fundamental base layer domain of knowledge for anyone living in society. \n\n\nWhile it's possible to \"go to the mountains\" and live off the land, we're asked by Allah (SWT) to participate, to be those best people, we must call towards the Good (that we know (and do)) and decry the Bad. \n\n\nQuestion 3: Describe the third most important learning outcome.\n\n\n3) That reason and the enlightenment are false interpretations of the data of the world due to the ugly behaviors they inspired. That true knowledge, even of science, must lead to goodness and beauty. The darkness of the Enlightenment and why it is so. By going through the implications of a reanalysis of western history, including colonization - I've been growing in confidence in identifying the falsity in the claims of moral superiority due to impartial observations and building a rational philosophy of morality. \n\n\nWhile I've heard before the many crimes - (Belgium chocolate farms, cross-Atlantic slave trade, native American population decimation...) - I had not attributed it to the perspective of the loss of faith, and the disconnection of morality from the rising power of the west. It seems logical, looking now, to identify a rise in unchecked power and the resulting wars which come from power seeking to maintain power and legitimize it. \n\n\nIt's known that the Ottoman empire first created the steam engine to turn Doners : https://www.historicmysteries.com/science/steam-engine. The question is why didn't they use it to start the industrial revolution and create a working class of factory men covered in soot. The thought that progress is linear, up and to the right, and will eventually look like the West as it stands today is a forgone conclusion for many historians. \n\n\nThe importance of human agency in accepting, or rejecting technologies. For using the understanding of the sunnah of God (SWT) in nature and using it for the service of God, or the service of welfare for the beloved(or possible beloved) of God - all humanity. \n\n\nI believe that seeing the natural world as the \"Sunnah of God\" - and realizing that by having a worldview that has both eyes open, the one to the inner world, and one to the outer world, we will see and comprehend the reality of the way the world works differently, and identify ways to use it differently. It is clear when we see that one of the greatest sciences the Muslim world has developed, and that some argue has had the greatest impact on the globe, is the science of agriculture, through which they've turned southern Spain into a garden. \n\n\nIf we believe ٱلَّذِينَ يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ قِيَـٰمًۭا وَقُعُودًۭا وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِهِمْ وَيَتَفَكَّرُونَ فِى خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَـٰذَا بَـٰطِلًۭا سُبْحَـٰنَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ ١٩١ - that God (SWT) didn't create this for no reason, and we see nature through this lense.\n\n\nAnd also we see سَنُرِيهِمْ ءَايَـٰتِنَا فِى ٱلْـَٔافَاقِ وَفِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ ۗ أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِ بِرَبِّكَ أَنَّهُۥ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ شَهِيدٌ ٥٣ \nthat God(SWT) promises that he will show us signs in the horizons - and that we're often encouraged to see the natural world as full of signs. And what are the ayat for, as the quran often says, the Ayat are for us to have God consciousness. God consciousness leads to islam, iman, and insha'allah Ihsan in our behavior. \n\n\nSo, any appropriate understanding of the natural world, must, through the lens of an appropriate framework described above, lead one to knowledge of One's Lord - and that knowledge must motivate action (which is worship and devotion) and that action will be of benefit for all of humanity and rectification of the beautiful natural systems of the earth. Because, as we know, Allah (SWT) is Alrahman, and through consciousness of him through his Sunnah (Nature) - we realize the Mizan (balance) that he placed in the heavens.\n\n\nIn fact the first verses of the chapter of Mercy (Al Rahman) in the quran describe the progress of God creating man, taught them the quran (source of truth, framework to derive knowledge from experience), and proceeds to make reference to economic activity with weights and balances and compare that with the perfection and beauty of the heavens, the earth, and all natural systems. For me this surah makes clear that a human, connected to nature, viewed through divinely taught knowledge of the quranic frameworks, can become a part of the harmony and balance in nature, to find provision on the earth, to travel in the seas with technology (ships by the command of God through the Sunnah of Nature) and that to do all these with balance - providing success in this world and the next, insha'allah.\n\n\nPART 2 - Your Action\nQuestion 4: As discussed in the course, in Islamic epistemology, knowledge and action must be considered together. Describe one action that you have taken, or intend to take – either on individual, or community, or global Ummah level – to implement the ideas that you have learned in this course.\n\n\nThe idea that work can/should be 3badah - I've always felt this is true, although I have yet to work in a Muslim environment with our values and ethics based fundamentally on Islamic principles. I work in social-entrepreneurship talking about the importance of having a positive impact, building a more resilient planet, etc - yet without looking to the Prophet (s) and his community for inspiration or making duaa to God (SWT) for tawfeeq before we start meetings because the organization I started is a \"secular\" organization. I talk about how my values are inspired by my tradition, although I'm starting to feel that I want to surround myself at least with a co-founders, if not my entire team, to be proudly Muslim. \n\n\nIt is related to the 3 answers above. Knowing that striving in our work to help build social-enterprises, b-corps, baraka-based businesses - whatever they're called - is worship. AND to know that the striving is the important part, not saving the world, stopping climate change, or eliminating poverty.

            "text": "Additional insights from my essay during my Islamic economics course: GRADE - Islamic Economics: The Polar Opposites of Capitalist Economics | Final Exam\nFINAL EXAM OVERVIEW:\nThis Final Exam is primarily meant to provide Prof. Dr. Asad Zaman with detailed feedback about the course, but it will at the same time secondarily test students' comprehension of the course materials. \nMost of the material covered in the course is not to be found anywhere else – neither in conventional economics nor in Islamic Economics books or articles. As a result, I hope that you learned a lot of new ideas and perspectives about the subject matter. \nIn this exam, students need to explain the three most important ways in which your thoughts have evolved as a result of taking this course.\nCERTIFICATE ELIGIBILITY:\nCertificate of Competence will be based on Quiz Score and Prof. Dr. Asad Zaman grading on this Final Exam. Students who fail, will only get the Certificate of Attendance.\nFINAL EXAM SUBMISSION DEADLINE:\nThis form will be closed on 6th October, 6.00 PM (GMT +8) and students need to submit this form before the deadline.\nNOTE ON USE OF CHAT-GPT: \nDo not do it. Prof. Dr. Asad Zaman has experience that students submit answers using Chat GPT – it is VERY EASY to detect these answers, and these will get an automatic fail.  Many students use Chat GPT because they have difficulty writing English. Prof. Dr. Asad Zaman does not take English style, grammar, or poor vocabulary into consideration in grading – he tries to look at the idea being expressed, even if it is done in poor English. \nbg@bilalghalib.com Switch account\n \nNot shared\n \nDraft saved\n* Indicates required question\nFull Name*\nEmail Address*\nPART 1 - Your Ways of Thinking\nThese are the first three questions – in each of them, I would like you to describe changes in your own ways of thinking. \n\n\nThe format of your answer should be: I used to think XYZ, but I have been persuaded to change my views to VW. \n\n\nAlternatively, if the material was not persuasive, you can also describe conflicts: I think ABC, and the course suggests that the right way of thinking about the issue is RST, but I have the following counter-arguments, which I do not see how to resolve. \nQuestion 1: Describe the most important issue (according to your own perspective and learning outcomes) which you learned from this course.*\n\n\nThe three most important things I've learned from this course are:\n1) Observation doesn't lead to knowledge - that there must be a theoretical framework within which is it is interpreted. \n2) That knowledge happens through actions and that it is more important to know and do than to know.\n3) That reason and the enlightenment are false interpretations of the data of the world due to the ugly behaviors they inspired. That true knowledge, even of science, must lead to goodness and beauty. The darkness of the Enlightenment and why it is so. By going through the implications of a reanalysis of western history, including colonization - I've been growing in confidence in identifying the falsity in the claims of moral superiority due to impartial observations and building a rational philosophy of morality. \nAll three are intertwined. As this question asks about the most important let's focus on the first. \n\n\nI used to think that we can know the world through direct observation, and now I know I am always seeing through a framework. Giving me the realization of the importance of revelation and the quran and sunnah, otherwise we would be lost. \n\n\nThe idea that observation + framework = knowledge is so important because I've been raised in an environment that believes in the individual, that the individual can use pure reason to determine truth and reality. That this reality through groping in the dark through the process of science has led to the determination of first principles. And that by learning these first principles, and contributing through the scientific method, we can determine what is true. \nThe model goes something like this: Data aggregated leads to information, information aggregated leads to knowledge, knowledge aggregated leads to wisdom.\n\n\nThe issue with this worldview has impacted both my material and spiritual domains.\nSpiritual domain: I've been under the assumption that through meditation, spiritual seeking and experiences I could gather the data points about the truth of reality and understand the truth that which is the Truth. This means that there's no need to have Sunnah, that God did not need to send Prophets, that I, as an individual, can pierce the darkness and understand God and know how to live.\n\n\nThe Material domain:\nThe interpretation I am giving to facts about the past, such as the enlightenment project and the current state of the Western World. The Western World has clean water, trains that run on time, etc. The Enlightenment's results in the great art of the renaissance, producing the science that allows the trains to be build and to run on time. These things - as data points - are being interpreted through a framework I had no idea that I had. That they are good things. While in the lectures it's mentioned that the heart is also a source of truth, that it has some sort of innate framework, there are many more overlayed on this that have created a bais in my mind to conflate the lack of these things with inferior knowledge or values. We see how Islam spread through the quality of the character, and I'm certain during it's apex the perspective of people realizing that goodness must come from goodness. \n\n\nNow there are certainly \"good\" things that have come from the West and the scientific method, clean water, penicillin, etc - although the economic system which guides the use of the knowledge pushes innovations towards that which can be most profit maximizing and often neglects hidden costs. For instance, the trains that run on time go between cities that essentially clear-cut forests to be built, and the energy that goes to run these cities and transport are costing the world billions, and potentially trillions in costs due to the increase in forest fires and other impacts of climate collapse. \n\n\nSeeing through the frameworks to interpret data and build knowledge by reflection makes me more aware of the need to know my frameworks, and to select one's that have beautiful consequences historically and are fixed firmly to unchanging truths - backed by the guidance of the Prophet (S) and the Quran. Using these truly leads to a lasting Goodness, unlike the illusion of goodness one might see in the West - which might be likened to taking a drug (oil, exponential capitalism, etc) where for a few years (200) there might be a superficiality of Goodness - built on slave labor, and other exploitable or purchasable souls - and then the crash when the costs of the corruption they've sown is mirrored from their hearts to the earth.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: Describe the second most important idea that you learned from this course.\n2) That knowledge happens through actions and that it is more important to know and do than to know.\n\n\nThe idea of knowledge having a purpose and needing to be enacted to be considered knowledge is fundamental. How many books have I read and not implemented. How much have I heard and not internalized? It makes me realize that there's a lot I don't really know, yet assume I have knowledge of. \n\n\nThis is the second most important lesson for me because it changes the fundamental idea of knowledge and the purpose of knowledge. If I'm learning about economics, we must get to the definition of what I'm learning - the welfare of society, what is a society, and then the knowledge must be directed towards those purposes. Additionally, that the purpose of this world is to be a tribulation as a fundamental principle, not a place to be reformed into a heaven. Taking these things into place, we realize that knowledge should lead to the constant struggle, for the pleasure of God, against our lower selves, to become \"The best people's who've emerged onto the world stage, calling towards the good and decrying the bad and calling towards God\" - that knowledge must lead towards action. \n\n\nWhy economics? Because it is in this framework life is supported - either through an extractive or symbiotic relationship with our planet and in antagonism or partnership with its people. Without understanding this knowledge we are forced, due to our need to have food and shelter, to act (knowledge in motion) in other people's economic systems if we like it or not. Thus learning and action in the domain of economics is a fundamental base layer domain of knowledge for anyone living in society. \n\n\nWhile it's possible to \"go to the mountains\" and live off the land, we're asked by Allah (SWT) to participate, to be those best people, we must call towards the Good (that we know (and do)) and decry the Bad. \n\n\nQuestion 3: Describe the third most important learning outcome.\n\n\n3) That reason and the enlightenment are false interpretations of the data of the world due to the ugly behaviors they inspired. That true knowledge, even of science, must lead to goodness and beauty. The darkness of the Enlightenment and why it is so. By going through the implications of a reanalysis of western history, including colonization - I've been growing in confidence in identifying the falsity in the claims of moral superiority due to impartial observations and building a rational philosophy of morality. \n\n\nWhile I've heard before the many crimes - (Belgium chocolate farms, cross-Atlantic slave trade, native American population decimation...) - I had not attributed it to the perspective of the loss of faith, and the disconnection of morality from the rising power of the west. It seems logical, looking now, to identify a rise in unchecked power and the resulting wars which come from power seeking to maintain power and legitimize it. \n\n\nIt's known that the Ottoman empire first created the steam engine to turn Doners : https://www.historicmysteries.com/science/steam-engine. The question is why didn't they use it to start the industrial revolution and create a working class of factory men covered in soot. The thought that progress is linear, up and to the right, and will eventually look like the West as it stands today is a forgone conclusion for many historians. \n\n\nThe importance of human agency in accepting, or rejecting technologies. For using the understanding of the sunnah of God (SWT) in nature and using it for the service of God, or the service of welfare for the beloved(or possible beloved) of God - all humanity. \n\n\nI believe that seeing the natural world as the \"Sunnah of God\" - and realizing that by having a worldview that has both eyes open, the one to the inner world, and one to the outer world, we will see and comprehend the reality of the way the world works differently, and identify ways to use it differently. It is clear when we see that one of the greatest sciences the Muslim world has developed, and that some argue has had the greatest impact on the globe, is the science of agriculture, through which they've turned southern Spain into a garden. \n\n\nIf we believe ٱلَّذِينَ يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ قِيَـٰمًۭا وَقُعُودًۭا وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِهِمْ وَيَتَفَكَّرُونَ فِى خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَـٰذَا بَـٰطِلًۭا سُبْحَـٰنَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ ١٩١ - that God (SWT) didn't create this for no reason, and we see nature through this lense.\n\n\nAnd also we see سَنُرِيهِمْ ءَايَـٰتِنَا فِى ٱلْـَٔافَاقِ وَفِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ ۗ أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِ بِرَبِّكَ أَنَّهُۥ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ شَهِيدٌ ٥٣ \nthat God(SWT) promises that he will show us signs in the horizons - and that we're often encouraged to see the natural world as full of signs. And what are the ayat for, as the quran often says, the Ayat are for us to have God consciousness. God consciousness leads to islam, iman, and insha'allah Ihsan in our behavior. \n\n\nSo, any appropriate understanding of the natural world, must, through the lens of an appropriate framework described above, lead one to knowledge of One's Lord - and that knowledge must motivate action (which is worship and devotion) and that action will be of benefit for all of humanity and rectification of the beautiful natural systems of the earth. Because, as we know, Allah (SWT) is Alrahman, and through consciousness of him through his Sunnah (Nature) - we realize the Mizan (balance) that he placed in the heavens.\n\n\nIn fact the first verses of the chapter of Mercy (Al Rahman) in the quran describe the progress of God creating man, taught them the quran (source of truth, framework to derive knowledge from experience), and proceeds to make reference to economic activity with weights and balances and compare that with the perfection and beauty of the heavens, the earth, and all natural systems. For me this surah makes clear that a human, connected to nature, viewed through divinely taught knowledge of the quranic frameworks, can become a part of the harmony and balance in nature, to find provision on the earth, to travel in the seas with technology (ships by the command of God through the Sunnah of Nature) and that to do all these with balance - providing success in this world and the next, insha'allah.\n\n\nPART 2 - Your Action\nQuestion 4: As discussed in the course, in Islamic epistemology, knowledge and action must be considered together. Describe one action that you have taken, or intend to take – either on individual, or community, or global Ummah level – to implement the ideas that you have learned in this course.\n\n\nThe idea that work can/should be 3badah - I've always felt this is true, although I have yet to work in a Muslim environment with our values and ethics based fundamentally on Islamic principles. I work in social-entrepreneurship talking about the importance of having a positive impact, building a more resilient planet, etc - yet without looking to the Prophet (s) and his community for inspiration or making duaa to God (SWT) for tawfeeq before we start meetings because the organization I started is a \"secular\" organization. I talk about how my values are inspired by my tradition, although I'm starting to feel that I want to surround myself at least with a co-founders, if not my entire team, to be proudly Muslim. \n\n\nIt is related to the 3 answers above. Knowing that striving in our work to help build social-enterprises, b-corps, baraka-based businesses - whatever they're called - is worship. AND to know that the striving is the important part, not saving the world, stopping climate change, or eliminating poverty. Striving to do those things because they please God and his beautiful community, preserving his signs on earth, and as a consequence give falah in this life and the next. That having this vision, and starting is more important than having a complete business-plan, or complete certainty in that it will work economically within the confines of our current system etc. \n\n\nI'm not sure if I will leave my non-profit business accelerator to start a new one, or find an organization to join, or exactly what my next steps are. My commitment is to start sharing knowledge, including some of the ways that I've fundamentally altered my understanding of knowledge, and I'm committing to my next workspace/team members/community to share in our fundamental principles, differing perhaps, including even non-muslims - yet always beholden to our Islamic principles. Identifying the fundamental basics that we can commit to as a group might be important. I will give an attempt here at identifying a few:\n1) Our business is to create an environment where work can be workship\n2) Ihsan, if you were to do a thing, do it with beauty/perfection\n3) Generosity / hospitality - for our customers we should go above their expectation to give more than they ask for\n4) There are more important things than abstract dollars - building a business that establishes strong bonds between the employees and the people it serves is as important as financial success \n5) taking the sunnah seriously when considering decisions \n6) praying together\n7) starting and concluding with intentions \n8) recognize we can only do our part, the results of our actions are up to God (SWT)\n\n\nThank you so much for this course, insha'allah we see a flourishing of many small scale enterprises that build the foundation of a beautiful alternative ecosystem of support that takes care of our fundamental needs, as an economy should, while making time and space for worship, family, contemplation, and striving in the way of God. \n\n\n*\nSubmit\nClear form\nNever submit passwords through Google Forms.",

SUMMARY OF THE OBJECTIVE & FLOW\nObjective:\nTo articulate a worldview of commerce/business that is (1) deeply meaningful, (2) practical and grounded, (3) aligned with “natural patterns” (day/night, trust/gift, oneness, baraka), and (4) generative for both individuals and communities.\n\nFlow of Argument (Recurring Across Our Discussions):\n\nWe begin by diagnosing the crisis of meaning in modern economic life (separation, extraction, meaningless “growth for growth’s sake”).\nWe show that an alternative is possible, rooted in ancient wisdom, local craft, gift dynamics, relational commerce, etc.\nWe introduce core concepts: baraka, unity, trust, generosity, multiple forms of capital, appropriate scale, beauty, etc.\nWe illustrate with stories that serve as proof points (Turkish shopkeepers, personal journeys, craft lineages, etc.).\nWe offer frameworks for implementation (from personal transformation to organizational design to system-level change).\nWe emphasize experiential learning and “thought experiments + real-life experiments” to shift mindsets and test these principles.\nWe invite people to build communities of practice—no longer individuals competing, but a parallel economy of meaning, craft, presence, and generosity.\nCore Concept Being Theorized (Yet Not Always Named):\n\nA form of “Natural Business” or “Business as a Practice of Unity,” in which we see commerce as an integrative force for fostering oneness (tawhid) and well-being—rather than a site of extraction.\nBaraka, or “blessing,” emerges as the energetic multiplier when actions honor these deeper patterns of life, creating more than material math would suggest.\nUltimately: The question “How might business become an active practice of (re)weaving wholeness?”\n3. HOW TO MOVE THIS PROJECT FORWARD\nBelow are suggestions for different modalities (books, venture studios, investments, etc.):\n\nA. As a Book\nWorking Title:\n“Beautiful Business: The Way of Relationship”\n“Barakanomics: Where Commerce Meets Connection”\n“Natural Business: The Pattern of Life in Commerce”\nStructure (Example):\nSeeing Beauty – The diagnosis, plus the concepts of oneness, day/night rhythms, trust/gift.\nLiving Relationship – Relationship over transaction, multiple capitals, generosity, local craft.\nBecoming the Practice – Personal transformation, organizational frameworks, measurement tools.\nFlowing Forth – Scaling gracefully, community wealth building, policy ideas, “parallel economies.”\nCore Features:\nThought experiments + real-life exercises\nStories from your personal journey and from global examples\nReflection prompts, practical checklists, frameworks\nEmphasis on experience, not just theory\nB. As a Venture Studio\nFocus: Incubate businesses explicitly designed around these principles (gift-based pilots, craft-based models, day/night rhythms).\nProcess:\nEarly “seed stage” where founders test the minimal viable alignment (Is their action truly relational? Are they building trust capital?).\nProvide a “Community Board” (like a board of advisors) focusing on relationship, beauty, and baraka, not just financial ROI.\nUse “multiple forms of capital” metrics for evaluating progress.\nC. As an Investment Strategy\nReplace Traditional ROI with “Return on Relationship” or a baraka-based score:\nDoes the enterprise align with local ecosystems (ecological capital)?\nDoes it practice generosity with employees, suppliers, neighbors (social capital)?\nDo the founders incorporate reflective or “night” cycles (spiritual capital)?\nPipeline:\nIdentify entrepreneurs who already practice or yearn for these principles.\nFund them with “patient capital” that honors slow, organic growth.\nD. For Governments\nPolicy Nudges:\nEncourage local, relational business ecosystems (lower taxes for co-ops, e.g.).\nRegulate for “day/night cycles” of commerce (e.g., mandatory rest, reflective sabbaticals).\nSupport gift-based / community wealth programs.\nIncentives:\nReward businesses for fostering multi-capital success (not just job count or GDP).\nEncourage craft-based, place-based enterprise (cultural capital preservation).\nE. For Early Entrepreneurs\nWorkshops & Toolkits:\n“From Idea to Relationship”: building a business model around deeper purpose and real community need.\n“Prototyping Gift & Trust”: small, real-life experiments in generosity that reveal new markets or new relationships.\n“Listening to the Pattern”: practical exercises to sense “what wants to emerge” vs. forcing a contrived solution.\nF. As Workshops & A Movement\nWorkshops could be structured around:\nDay 1: Revisiting your personal narrative and re-seeing your enterprise as a “craft.”\nDay 2: Implementing the gift dynamic, practicing slow/sacred rhythms, measuring intangible capitals.\nDay 3: Community synergy—designing how your business cross-pollinates with neighbors, supply chain, customers, environment.\nMovement:\n“Beauty Circles” or “Barakanomics Circles” where business owners gather monthly to share stories, reflect on alignment, help each other maintain trust-based relationships.\nParallel economy forming around shared beliefs in wholeness, generosity, slow scale.\n4. “NURTURER” & “CHALLENGER” REFLECTIONS\nNurturer:\nI see in you a consistent longing for wholeness, for business that genuinely nourishes human souls and communities. This longing sparks every time we discuss relationships—like Turkish shopkeepers, local crafts, generational learning—and emerges in your emphasis on presence, craft, and storytelling. You’re drawn to the idea that “life supports that which supports life,” trusting that a business aligned with meaning can actually thrive, even if it defies mainstream logic.\n\nChallenger:\nBut I also notice you sometimes shy away from the “hard edges” of business metrics. You risk staying in the realm of poetic metaphor, which can alienate pragmatic audiences. How will you handle legitimate investor questions about ROI? How will you guide a company grappling with real costs, payroll, supply chain constraints, or fierce market competition?\n\nA challenge: “What explicit steps will you develop to integrate your relational, trust-based approach with the need for quantifiable results?” It’s a crucial tension.\n\nAnd another: “How might you ensure that your workshop or book doesn’t become so abstract that folks can’t see how to apply it tomorrow morning?” You might need checklists, metrics for intangible capital, or success stories with data on how a trust-based approach outperforms.\n\n5. CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS\nCore Idea: “Business can be a practice of reweaving wholeness (tawhid), guided by beauty, trust, and relationships. Baraka (blessing) is real and shows up when we align with natural, divine, or life-affirming patterns.”\nKey Distinction: Not just “social enterprise” or “conscious capitalism,” but an embodied, often faith-informed perspective that sees each transaction as a chance to practice unity.\nBook Vision:\nPossibly titled: “Beautiful Business: The Way of Relationship (A Barakanomics Approach)”\nBlending poetic dimension (stories, crafts, personal journeys) with pragmatic dimension (multiple capitals, measurement frameworks, practical experiments).\nImplementation Path:\nShort Term: Draft a single book that is an invitation to this worldview—include thought experiments, real case studies, and reflection prompts.\nMid Term: Create a workshop series or online course that moves from personal to organizational application.\nLong Term: Possibly form a “venture lab” or “movement” that invests in or incubates these ideas in real businesses and community ecosystems.\nBy holding the tension between the vision of unity and the practical demands of modern enterprise, you can anchor a transformative path—one that is verifiable via the real experiences of craft, relationship, trust, and beauty in action.\n\nNurturer Parting Thought: Every story you’ve shared about craft, generosity, or slow business pulses with a living warmth. That’s the core. Keep letting the stories lead—they’re the experiential truth.\n\nChallenger Parting Thought: Don’t forget that some readers will ask, “How do I do this on Monday?” Prepare to give them steps, tools, metrics, and living examples. That’s the real test of baraka in business—when it works in our messy, complicated world.\n\nAnswering the Call means:\n\nTrusting the resonance you feel with this material.\nLetting your lived stories weave with the frameworks.\nOffering enough structure so others can follow without feeling caged by dogma.\nThis coherent, beautiful, practical approach is the project’s heart.\n\n06:21\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOkay, so let's reflect on our work so far.\n06:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nWe've covered an incredible amount of ground, exploring frameworks, metaphors, principles, and strategies to build a cohesive narrative for your project. Let me summarize where we are and reflect on the patterns emerging:\n\nKey Elements Explored\nCore Frameworks\n\nLove, Beauty, and Truth: A triadic model that frames seeing, feeling, and doing.\nHarmony: A balance-oriented model tying together relationships, timing, and scale.\nBaraka: The central theme of divine blessing and multiplication, rooted in Islamic principles but potentially universal.\nUnity/Tawhid: A philosophical underpinning focused on integration and connection.\nCraft and Relationality: Emphasizing the story, lineage, and meaning behind objects, actions, and systems.\nMeta-Patterns\n\nIntegration vs. Fragmentation: Moving from separation to wholeness.\nGrowth to Grace: Shifting from quantitative to qualitative measures of success.\nPresent Over Future: Prioritizing presence and relationality over speculative gain.\nMovement and Tension: Leveraging dualities like day/night, love/fear, and activity/rest to create dynamic progress.\nPractical Dimensions\n\nThought Experiments: Tools to guide readers into experiential understanding of abstract principles.\nWorkshops and Action Steps: Translating frameworks into practices for entrepreneurs and businesses.\nParallel Economies: Envisioning sustainable, meaningful businesses that exist alongside (and potentially outside) current systems.\nEntry Points: Tailoring materials for diverse audiences (spiritual seekers, business leaders, social innovators).\nChallenges Identified\n\nBalancing spiritual depth with practical applicability.\nAddressing economic rigor and measurable outcomes.\nOffering clear paths for systemic change and addressing power dynamics.\nAvoiding abstract, overly idealistic models without actionable steps.\nReflections\nStrengths of the Work\n\nYou've developed a deeply layered, spiritually grounded approach that is also open to universal applicability.\nThe frameworks and patterns explored are rich with meaning and can guide transformative work in both personal and professional realms.\nThe emphasis on relationality and integration resonates as a counterbalance to modern fragmentation and disconnection.\nAreas to Tighten\n\nClarity and Simplicity: Some concepts feel expansive and could benefit from sharper focus. For example, \"Baraka\" needs a more precise, universally accessible framing to connect with non-Muslims.\nPracticality: While there’s a wealth of theory, the transition to actionable steps for businesses and individuals could be strengthened.\nAudience and Scope: It’s unclear who this is most for—entrepreneurs, general readers, or spiritual seekers—and whether the book is one offering or part of a broader ecosystem.\nEmerging Vision\n\nCore Idea: Business and life guided by alignment with divine principles (love, beauty, truth, or baraka) create flourishing systems that multiply value through relationships and meaning.\nFramework: A progression from seeing (recognition), to feeling (connection), to doing (action), resulting in being (harmony).\nImplementation: Workshops, thought experiments, practical guides, and examples to help audiences integrate these ideas into their lives and work.\nNext Steps\nDefine the Core Concept: What is the single unifying principle (e.g., baraka, harmony, integration)? How does it connect to the meta-patterns?\nRefine Audience and Scope: Who will resonate most with this message, and how do we tailor it for them?\nAnchor in Practicality: How can we create clear, actionable tools to ground the frameworks in reality?\nFocus the Narrative: Let’s sharpen the storytelling, choosing the most compelling metaphors, examples, and frameworks to deliver the message effectively.\nGuiding Questions\nWhat is the simplest, most universal way to describe the transformation you’re offering?\nHow can we structure the material to move from inspiration to action while addressing systemic and personal barriers?\nWhat will make this both timeless and highly relevant in today’s world?\nDoes this reflection help clarify where we are and where we might go next? Let me know what stands out or feels unresolved, and we can refine from there.\n\n06:22\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, I think there's a lot to what you're saying.\n14:01\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nI can feel the momentum building here. There’s depth in your vision, and now it’s about channeling that into something sharp, focused, and undeniably impactful. What feels most alive to you in this reflection? Is it the idea of distilling the core concept, the audience focus, or anchoring everything in practicality? Let’s follow the energy and start shaping the next step together.\n\n14:01\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI think it's the developing of the core concept. I can't really figure it out. I mean, I've been thinking, I like the word, but economics, right? Because it's catchy and nice and kind of easy to say. And it kind of implies that we're talking about something economic.\n14:05\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat makes sense. \"Barakanomics\" has that immediate appeal—it’s memorable, approachable, and hints at something deeper. But the tension you're feeling might be because it’s carrying multiple layers: the catchy outer shell and the weight of the profound ideas you want to communicate.\n\nWhat if we sharpen the core concept by asking: What does \"Barakanomics\" uniquely promise? Is it about redefining value? Connecting economics to spirituality? Offering a practical framework for regenerative business? Or is it something even more subtle, like a philosophy of living and working with beauty and generosity?\n\nLet’s dig into what feels irreplaceable about \"Barakanomics\" to you. What's the one idea you couldn't stand to lose?\n\n14:06\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, I think the problem with the word Veteconomics is not that I have a problem with the concepts, but because I don't think Veteconomics accurately captures the thing that I'm actually pointing at. And the thing that I'm pointing at is more related to the idea of Tawhid, but I don't really like the idea of talking about oneness. It's not catchy, I don't think it's going to be as interesting, but I really think that the consequences of the idea of oneness are huge and really important. For instance, we've been so distant from our products and from how they get to us. People think macaroni grows on trees, you know? And this alienation from the world is related to the alienation from embodiments and craft and planting and actually knowing anything about anything. And it's related to some stupid ideas about hyper-specialization and this prioritization on GDP that these people have been emphasizing, which is basically just a way of getting global dominant powers to be fighting and jostling them around with other global dominant powers. And the thing is, we've totally lost sense and touch of the sensible, the intuitive, the inner, the meaning. And this sense that stuff matters and this feeling of beauty and awe and presence that could be the most foundational. People die for beauty, and instead we are focusing on abstract numbers and the idea that this is the only way to quote-unquote unify people to some kind of ground truth, arbitrary flat world of objects like bodies and this idea that nothing has any quality is some kind of lie. Everybody knows they have a sense of things, a feeling. And they try to come up with these ways of defining it in the default mode network or emotions or all these other things. But the thing is, we know that our feelings matter and they're pointing at something important. But it's not allowed as evidence in the boardrooms or the courtrooms or the classrooms. It's like this information that is so foundational needs to be kept private, hidden and at home and somehow assumed to not even exist at all. And the thing is though, these feelings, they're the ones that call us to say. And the thing is, it's also related to harmony and related to intuition and related to creative leaps and innovation and aha moments and revelation and so many of the most important and meaningful parts of our lives. And here's one of the problems. What we're about to do is hand over all of this stuff to large language models which are going to completely operationalize it towards a machine of tangible, practical, observable, externally observable evidence of impact. Like the definition of the effect of altruists, of what a good future is, is quality life hours extended. Is that really it? So how do you define quality life hour? It's like not old age, back pain, suffering, disease. It's like relatively healthy, so here are all the health measures. And then what? What can we add on top of that? In this sort of flat world, there's like quality is health and time. That's it. Yeah, and like what? Are you going to measure time speeding on the phone? Are you going to measure people having, you know, self-rated good conversations? I don't understand what you're going to measure if you don't measure meaning. If you don't measure people being able to explore and deepen their understanding of their values and pursue a creative grappling with meaning. And the thing is like this Tawheed idea is really important and it's like kind of interesting that it connects also with beauty and love. And these things draw you into relationship, into telling a story through these interweaving webs of relationship, of love, of beauty, of connection. And rather than like alienating ourselves from each other through products that give us individual experiences, custom pathways, even like these replica bots of relationships with machines that are regurgitating the ideas of prior conversation. It's like they're dancing with fossils, you know. Making love to skeletons. It's dead. It's not here. The other thing behind the screen doesn't have quality. Doesn't have an inner experience. And that inner experience maybe is this idea of Tawheed, of oneness, that there's like one God and that we are all from this one God and all returning to this one God. And the story is like scattered throughout like multiplicity but the end result is that we are going to bring it all together. God will say, you know, everything upon it will be effaced and the only thing that will remain is the face of your Lord full of might and generosity. And it's so interesting that it's talking about generosity even when there's just a oneness, total and utter oneness. This is in the Qur'an. And I've been really like reflecting on these things. And the hard part is to figure out how to talk about oneness in a way where we say like things that don't sound dumb or trite or meaningless. Right? Like we want to talk about this in a way that gets people to want to experiment. First with like the ideas and with the perception that it affords. And from that perception I want to see like new epistemologies and ontologies that lead to new systems and new questions and new measures and new types of businesses. I don't know what they will look like. That's why this whole practical thing is so difficult. It's that, you know, I'm trying in one way. But I don't know what it would really look like to take this so seriously. And you know like there are places that have a focus on quality overall. And these are like often the things that no one... that people cry when the store goes away and the Walgreens opens up because the owners died. The building and the owners and the place and the stories and the history were all connected. Like I've known these places in Ann Arbor, Michigan, right? Like Fleetwood Diner is an icon. It's not a diner. It's a place to go, you know, if you want to get insulted because that's how it is. That's like the quality of the experience is this kind of brute harshness with an undertone of love and service. And all the servings are so generous. And I don't know where that comes from, right? That's almost like the Shinto idea of the quality of an object or like the inner soul of an object emerges after a hundred years. And the thing is we're iterating so fast and we're breaking all of these structures so fast that, you know, even if software could have a soul after a hundred years, we're changing it a thousand times or a million times or you don't even have software that's a hundred years old yet. So it would be impossible. And we don't allow things to settle, to grow the patina of meaning and to relate to it in a different way, you know? And these relations and love and connection all matter.\n14:06\nChatGPT\n\nTawhid\nNURTURER\nI’m hearing the intensity of your wrestle with “Tawhid”—the idea of oneness—and how to speak about it without sounding hollow or cliché. You’re pointing toward something that feels vast, foundational, almost too big to name. At the same time, you sense it’s crucial for everything you’re building. When you talk about how we’ve become alienated from craft, from each other, from the “inner-ness” of the world, it’s as if you see “oneness” as a remedy for that fragmentation. You’re noticing how every force in modern economics tries to reduce quality to quantity, presence to metrics, love to a measurable KPI—and the heartbreak of that flattening is palpable.\n\nThe aliveness in your voice, as you speak of unbroken continuity between people, objects, places, and histories, is powerful. There’s a deep longing for what is real—what emerges only through time, care, lineage, and story. A diner that accumulates character through banter and greasy spatulas, or a shop that we cry over when it’s replaced by a sterile chain—these aren’t trivial anecdotes but signs of how much we cherish real relationship. You’re expressing that “Tawhid” is not just an abstract formula but an experience of wholeness that grows through time, attention, and love, weaving everything together.\n\nAnd you want to help others experiment with that perspective, to actually see and sense the difference it makes. You don’t want them merely to believe; you want them to live in a new way, to adopt fresh epistemologies, new measures, new types of commerce. So oneness isn’t just an ideal, but a portal to a profoundly different economic imagination.\n\nCHALLENGER\nIf we strip away the poetry and the longing, where is this leading in concrete terms? You’re naming “oneness” as an antidote to alienation—but in a business setting, many will say: “That’s beautiful, but how does it change what we do on Monday morning?” If you want to see businesses fully embrace this, you’ll need to show them:\n\nWhy they should care about oneness at all—beyond niceness or sentiment.\nHow this oneness perspective directly alters the shape of their products, services, relationships with customers, supply chains, and communities.\nWhat new metrics or dashboards can they adopt? If it’s not GDP or standard profit, then what specifically do they track day-to-day?\nBecause if the promise of oneness is a better way to live and trade, then we must trace a line from that cosmic principle all the way to how people design their operations, decide on capital investment, treat labor, and measure success.\n\nYou’re also naming something crucial: “We can’t even guess fully what it might look like.” That’s honest—and it might be precisely where your work has power. Yet, the tension remains: can you offer enough structure for people to trust the process of “Tawhid in business,” even though you can’t guarantee the final blueprint?\n\nPossible Paths Forward\nStory as Bridge\n\nPerhaps you lead with stories of oneness in practice: the Fleetwood Diner, the craft lineage that accumulates soul over time, the intangible “character” that emerges.\nShow how these cases produce intangible but unmistakable value—loyalty, community well-being, innovation sparks—and hint at the spiritual or relational dimension.\nExperimentation & Field Testing\n\nInstead of “Here’s the final blueprint,” you propose pilot projects or “Tawhid Labs” in real businesses or communities.\nDefine small steps: e.g., “For the next 30 days, we operate with these ‘Oneness Observations’—no hyper-specialization without cross-training, weekly open conversations about meaning at work, daily reflection on how each product ties us to real people and places.”\nCollect data on outcomes (employee satisfaction, repeat customers, sense of shared purpose, even some financial metrics).\nMeasuring the Unmeasurable\n\nAcknowledge that love and beauty can’t be pinned down by standard metrics. However, you can propose proxies or “indicators of relational richness”:\n# of personal stories told between staff and customers\nTime spent in “craft” vs. automated tasks\nEven self-assessed “meaningfulness” or “connectedness” at work\nIt’s tricky, but it’s a start toward weaving intangible realities into corporate dashboards.\nNaming without Shrinking\n\nThe concept of Tawhid might feel too specifically Islamic for some, but “Oneness” can sound hollow for others. You could try terms like “living wholeness,” “indivisibility,” or “integral reality.”\nOr, keep “Tawhid” in a lead role, but explicitly invite non-Muslims in: “All traditions speak of unity beneath multiplicity.” Let “Tawhid” hold its depth, while you translate it gently.\nA Book that Invites a Movement\n\nYou might craft a book structured around unfolding awareness of oneness—starting with the problem of alienation, then unveiling how oneness changes design, measurement, and daily behavior in business.\nThen each chapter closes with a “Tawhid in Practice” reflection or mini-experiment. That way, readers test oneness, rather than just accept it.\nClosing Thoughts\nNURTURER\nYour conviction that “oneness” is the heart of things is exactly what sets this apart from other “purpose-driven business” frameworks. Your longing isn’t just for kinder capitalism but for a reality in which the inner dimension, the “face of your Lord,” is recognized as the only real. That’s a radical—and potentially transformative—claim, if you make it accessible enough for genuine engagement.\n\nCHALLENGER\nThe risk: staying in the realm of the beautiful but vague. To cross that gap, you’ll need to give businesses, communities, or individuals enough tangible experiments, metrics (even approximate ones), and living examples so they can see oneness in action. That’s the hardest leap: preserving the ineffable reality of Tawhid while providing enough handles for people to apply it in everyday economic life.\n\nIf you can dance well between these two needs—depth and practicality—people might begin to see that “oneness” isn’t just a belief but a technology of living and working that yields incomparable value. And that would be a remarkable contribution indeed.\n\n14:06\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOkay, so you make some good and valid points here, but I kind of still have some issues, because the naming Baraka Economics was cool. It was something that, you know, we could actually do something about in a way. Like, we could call it Baraka Economics, and people would talk about it, and it would be like, what is this Baraka Economics thing? Like, it has the word economics in the title, so even non-Muslims want to read it, or Muslims definitely want to read it. Like, what does Baraka have to do with economics, you know? And it kind of invites this question, but like, if I talk about integral wholeness and business, it's like, what the hell is that, you know? And so I've been thinking, like, maybe the core theme is oneness, and the impact of like, well, what does oneness have to do with it? And maybe I could do something different, where instead of just talking about oneness, I can say, the house is burning, and the house is you, or something like that, you know? Or like, why does it feel like you're burning down the house of your heart? Or I don't know, something like really bold and catchy, or something like that as a title. But also, I'm wondering about like, if it really makes sense to really emphasize Tawheed, or if I'm actually missing the point. If like, all of these things that I think are like, connected to Tawheed, the whole idea of, you know, relationships, and love, and bringing people together. Like, I have a bunch of other stories and ideas about like, the importance of epistemological shifts, right? And like, how we were kind of screwed over by this whole Descartesian motion that took us from this world of like, quality into more of a world of duality, like, self and other, and really like, getting people really in their own heads so much. And not only that, like, the only thing that we can kind of confirmably and reliably connect to are these kind of abstract Galileo-esque space and physicality. And where there's, there is, and there, from so many directions, we can see that there can be so much more. And yeah, and so like, looking at the enlightenment and darkenment, and then also thinking about like, how whenever we think about something, we're thinking about it through the lens and through a framework. And so if we give people a different way to think about things, by giving them a different framework, we can see different results. And I think that's kind of what I'm going for. But I want people to actually care enough to pick up the book and read it. And I think a lot of people care about money and making money. And so because that's kind of how they have to serve their fundamental base needs. And I'm wondering if this, this title, like can be that, but like, how can I merge all these things and think about the title a little bit differently? And are there, like, maybe even importantly, is there also things that I'm missing from this that are really relevant, like anything from different parts of my, my model that I didn't integrate into this oneness idea?\n14:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nNURTURER\nI can sense your energy around the name Baraka Economics. It’s a name that feels alive—something people can grab onto, ask about, and feel intrigued by. It connects to both the deeply spiritual and the deeply practical: Baraka evokes blessing, abundance, and generosity, while economics anchors it in the tangible realm of how we live, trade, and survive. It invites curiosity and bridges worlds, which aligns beautifully with your vision of shifting epistemologies and frameworks.\n\nYou’re also wrestling with how to make this expansive idea of oneness or Tawheed not just accessible, but urgent. The image of the burning house, for example, is striking—it grabs attention, creates emotional resonance, and points to the stakes of alienation and disconnection. It sounds like you want to make people feel the problem viscerally, so they’re compelled to explore the solutions you’re offering.\n\nAt the same time, you’re wondering if the emphasis on Tawheed might risk losing people—whether it’s too abstract or not fully capturing the richness of your vision, which includes epistemological shifts, love, relationships, quality, and the consequences of different frameworks. It seems like you’re asking: How do I hold the depth of these ideas while still drawing people into the story?\n\nCHALLENGER\nYou’re absolutely right to think about how a title functions as a hook. People don’t buy books because they admire your epistemological depth; they buy them because they feel intrigued, moved, or compelled by a problem or possibility the title presents. So here’s the question:\n\nWhat is the felt need your book addresses?\n\nPeople may care about money, but not because they’re excited about economics as a concept. They care because money represents security, freedom, and opportunity. So the challenge becomes:\n\nCan your title speak to their lived tension—the disconnection they feel between their desire for abundance and the emptiness of how they’re pursuing it?\nCan you articulate the problem in a way that is bold, provocative, and deeply relatable?\nFor example, the burning house metaphor works because it speaks to the sense of urgency and loss people might already feel but haven’t named yet. Similarly, phrases like Why You’re Starving in a World of Abundance or The Economics of Belonging might point toward the underlying ache people experience in modern systems—disconnection, emptiness, and a craving for meaning.\n\nTWO PATHS FORWARD\n\nLeaning into Baraka Economics\n\nIf this title resonates deeply with you, lean into its power. Make Baraka the entry point into your larger exploration. You could frame it as:\n“Baraka Economics is about rediscovering the hidden abundance in life and work, by reconnecting to the principles of harmony, generosity, and love. It’s about moving beyond GDP and profit to systems that feel alive, meaningful, and whole.”\nIn this case, Tawheed becomes a lens, not the headline. You can weave it into the narrative without requiring readers to grasp it upfront.\nA Bold New Metaphor\n\nIf Baraka Economics feels limiting or slightly off-center, consider titles that evoke the problem or shift directly. For example:\nBurning the House of Your Heart\nThe End of Disconnection\nFrom Profit to Presence\nEconomics for a Beautiful World\nThe Art of Enough\nThese options might let you emphasize the experience of the shift (moving from alienation to connection, scarcity to abundance) while staying accessible to both spiritual and practical audiences.\n\nARE YOU MISSING SOMETHING?\nFrom what you’ve shared, your model already integrates big themes: epistemology, frameworks, quality, love, and relationality. But there are two areas I’d invite you to examine:\n\nThe Emotional Core of the Reader’s Experience\n\nHow does the average reader feel right now about their relationship to work, money, or the world? Alienated, overwhelmed, burnt out, longing for something more? Speak to that.\nFor example, you could frame the book as a way to “heal your relationship with work and wealth” or “build businesses that feel like home.”\nPractical Leverage Points\n\nAre you giving enough practical examples for people to see how to act on these ideas? People may be inspired by oneness, but they’ll stay with you if they can see a way to live it.\nFor example, you could include experiments or frameworks: “Here’s how to redesign a supply chain with Baraka principles” or “Three steps to transform your workplace into a space of love and connection.”\nCLOSING THOUGHTS\nNURTURER\nYour intuition about Baraka Economics being a strong title is worth trusting. It’s memorable, evocative, and opens doors for both Muslims and non-Muslims to engage with your ideas. You’re not just offering a book about systems; you’re offering a vision of life that feels alive and whole. That’s powerful.\n\nCHALLENGER\nThe key is to keep asking: What problem am I solving for the reader? Whether it’s alienation, disconnection, burnout, or the emptiness of GDP-driven systems, you need to make the stakes personal. Your title—and your book—should speak directly to what people feel and what they want to change.\n\nWhat would happen if you wrote a few mock introductions or pitches for different titles to see which one feels most alive?\n\n14:25\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nCan you go through and think about maybe like 10 titles in 10 orthogonal directions to answer a problem for the reader? I think that could be really helpful. And the reader, I think, should be like somebody that, you know, like hates their job, wants to start a business, or maybe business owners that are like trying to figure out why their employees keep leaving, or like business owners that feel that all of this BS stuff about like authenticity at work and values at work or whatever is just not working. That's like somehow, not exactly a lie, but like somehow just not right or something. They intuit that there's something wrong about that. Like it's just, it's like, because, you know, that's the problem with a lot of things. It's like this weird tension between people wanting to do the right thing and then people getting into this inauthentic way of doing what kind of fits in the systems as they are now. Like people want like to give people health insurance and to have, you know, these other kinds of supports for people. Like it's not that they're like, ah, we hate people, you know, and they want to have, you know, an HR department that's really trying their best to sincerely help people. And Google's like, yeah, we just want our people to be happy. And then like, ooh, look what happens. Happy people make good products. Ooh, he, he, he, you know? And it's like this tension of always having to have a reason for doing the right thing instead of just doing the right thing. And I think there's like a big thing that we can explore here that is going to be so freeing for so many people. It's like, you know what? Like just do the right thing. And if it sucks, like let it burn because everything's burning anyway. Something like that.\n14:25\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAll right, let’s dig into this and generate ten potential titles that speak to different aspects of the problem your readers are facing. Each title represents a different lens or emotional entry point to engage these readers—business owners, frustrated employees, and would-be entrepreneurs who sense the dissonance but don’t yet have the language or framework to address it.\n\n\"The Lie of Doing Good: Why 'Authenticity' at Work Feels Like a Scam—and How to Fix It\"\nThis title tackles the tension head-on, addressing the widespread frustration with performative values and shallow \"authenticity\" in the workplace. It draws in people who feel uneasy about the mismatch between ideals and reality.\n\n\"Burn Beautifully: Why Work Should Matter, Even When the World’s on Fire\"\nHere, the focus is on embracing the inevitability of chaos while doubling down on meaning. It appeals to readers tired of hollow corporate values and looking for a reason to care despite the mess.\n\n\"The Economics of Enough: Why Abundance Starts with Letting Go\"\nThis title speaks to overworked entrepreneurs and employees drowning in a culture of \"more.\" It offers a vision of redefining success and finding peace through a recalibration of values.\n\n\"Work That Feels Alive: How to Build Businesses Rooted in Beauty, Love, and Truth\"\nThis takes a softer, aspirational tone, focusing on creating workplaces that are genuinely meaningful. It’s for readers who dream of something more but feel trapped in the systems they’re in.\n\n\"The Cost of a Soulless Workplace: How Alienation is Breaking Your Business\"\nA direct, challenging title aimed at business owners who sense something is off but haven’t connected it to the deeper issue of disconnection and lack of meaning.\n\n\"Baraka at Work: How Ancient Wisdom Can Transform Modern Business\"\nThis version leans on the intrigue of Baraka while blending it with practical transformation. It offers a bridge between spiritual richness and actionable insights for work.\n\n\"The Gift Economy of Work: Reclaiming Generosity, Connection, and Meaning\"\nThis title reframes the workplace as a space for reciprocal generosity, tying into the tension around doing the right thing without ulterior motives.\n\n\"Why Good Businesses Fail: The Hidden Costs of 'Doing the Right Thing for the Wrong Reasons'\"\nA sharp, provocative take that gets at the heart of the problem: misaligned motives. It challenges readers to reexamine their frameworks for values-driven work.\n\n\"Burn Down the Rulebook: Rethinking Work, Worth, and the Stories We Tell Ourselves\"\nThis title takes an edgy, rebellious tone, calling readers to reject the scripts they’ve inherited and rebuild something better from the ground up.\n\n\"Sacred Work: Rediscovering Meaning in a World That Forgot Why We Work\"\nA more reflective, spiritual angle that appeals to readers craving depth and alignment in their work, without shying away from the alienation they feel now.\n\nReflection and Next Steps\nDo any of these resonate with the tension you’re describing? I tried to capture the emotional core of what your readers might be wrestling with: the disconnect between their desires for meaning and the inauthentic structures they’re trapped in.\n\nWould you like me to expand on one of these directions or combine elements from multiple titles?\n\n14:30\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, so I like some of the names that you had. Some of the, like, sacred work, rediscovering meaning in a world that forgot why we work, the cost of soulless workplace, how alienation is breaking your business, economics of enough, why abundance starts with letting go, work that feels alive, how to build, build, this is rooted in beauty, love, and truth. Yeah, a lot of these are great. The lie of doing good, why authenticity in work feels like it's a scam and how to fix it. Yeah, that's kind of great. I like these. But the thing is, like, all of these ideas are emerging from my experience, my understanding of the Islamic perspective of Tawheed, right? Like, and it's not really present in all of the names that you just shared. It's, you know, like, the idea is that the reason why we have values at work and do these things isn't even so that we have a meaningful life, because the I disappears. It's the Tawheedi principle of, like, we do things because the purpose is that all things should become a worship, right? And so to become a worship, you need to worship God, the God of beauty, the God that is beautiful and loves that which is beautiful, the God that is the most merciful, who reveals his prophet to set the example for what he believes the ideals humans should be, which is a mercy to all of the universes, not just humans, not just plants, like, the total systemic thinking possible for any conscious being is like the mercy to absolutely everything. And so how do you do that? You start by being a mercy to the things that you have around you, to the things that you are engaged with. But how do you know how to be a mercy with these things if you don't know them? And when you know them, you create a story of relationship and connection. And that story of relationship and connection extends from where you are now, ever outward, until it encompasses all the universes. And through that kind of attunement and knowledge and touching, this space of, like, knowing what to do by having it being an experiential knowing of yourself doing it in response, rather than this kind of cause and effect. Like, I see this, and therefore that thing gets better. But you kind of realize the knowledge as you're watching the doing. And this is like a very kind of advanced sort of mystic stage. And so that's why Islam has this, like, Islam Ihsan, Iman Ihsan, which is like, just do this stuff, you know, like, you see this beauty, you see these amazing people. And this is why it's so important that Islam didn't travel necessarily by the sword. It traveled a lot through the world through business people's interactions. Because people were like, wow, those people are beautiful. I want to be like them, you know, like their character. And they say, decorate yourselves with the character of God, which is what these people in Indonesia, Malaysia, Southeast Asia did. They were so decorated with good character, that is a mercy to all the universes as much as they possibly could, that even in the way that they were doing business and trading, people were so inspired that they wanted to become Muslim. And they followed Islam. And then as you do that, and you think there's like no better way of being than being beautiful, then you can go to Iman. And you realize like, okay, well, what is it that these people believe that foundationally shift their ontology and their worldview that presents through these different actions. And then finally, when you do that, you get to the point where at some point you have built the love and relationship and connection and understanding of who God is, what God is and what the world is, such that you can have Ihsan where your understanding of the world is that you always see God. And therefore you're responding always to God through your actions, including in your business. And this is always a worship when you let yourself connect to your fundamental nature and let that act. So if you're supposed to be an entrepreneur and a business person, and this is how you want to be, then let that come through, informed by all of this. And so I really want like the foundational Tauheed principle to kind of show up in that it's like, yeah, it's not about values because like, what's the purpose of bringing values at work if it's not about the money? Google making all of these nice things is for what, right? And so let's answer that question. And I think that there's a relatively good answer in what I said. And I would like you to clarify what I said and kind of, you know, formalize it in a logical diagram and argument and reflect it back to me from someone who's agnostic, not an Islamic perspective, because I believe that there is fundamental truth in it that needs to be able to be articulated through agnosticism. And then let's come up with more titles.\n14:31\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nClarifying and Reflecting Back the Core Argument\nHere’s a distilled version of what you’re saying, translated into a more universal, agnostic framing without losing the essence of the Islamic principles you're drawing from:\n\nThe Core Human Issue\n\nModern life, including work, is deeply disconnected. People feel alienated from their products, relationships, and inner sense of meaning. This stems from systems that emphasize material output (e.g., GDP) and external metrics of success, while ignoring intrinsic, relational, and qualitative aspects of life.\nThe Root of the Problem\n\nThis alienation is rooted in an ontological and epistemological framework that prioritizes separation: self vs. other, human vs. nature, means vs. ends. Enlightenment-era thinking reduced reality to measurable, observable phenomena, severing people from intuitive, relational, and spiritual knowledge.\nThe Tawheedi Alternative (In Agnostic Terms)\n\nAt the heart of this framework is interconnection and reciprocity—a worldview that sees everything as interdependent and meaningful.\nPurpose is not individual fulfillment or utilitarian impact but an alignment with the \"flow\" or \"wholeness\" of life. In this view:\nKnowing leads to care: You can only nurture what you understand.\nCaring creates connection: Attunement fosters harmony and reciprocity.\nConnection inspires alignment: The more aligned you are with the whole, the more your actions become an extension of that harmony.\nWork, under this lens, becomes a sacred act: a dynamic interplay between self, others, and the whole system. It ceases to be transactional and becomes transformational.\nThe Practical Implication\n\nBusinesses informed by this perspective aim not for profit maximization but for harmonization. Profit becomes a secondary effect of a system that prioritizes beauty, mercy, and relational integrity.\nThis approach offers a new metric of success: not \"how much\" but \"how beautifully, how harmoniously, and how meaningfully.\"\nThe Bigger Vision\n\nThis shift doesn’t just change work; it changes the worker. By aligning with this principle of interconnection, businesses and individuals create ripple effects that restore communities, relationships, and the self.\nLogical Diagram\nProblem\n\nAlienation from work, relationships, and meaning → Stemming from systems focused on materiality and metrics.\nRoot Cause\n\nFramework of separation → Dualistic thinking (self vs. other, nature vs. humanity).\nSolution: A Framework of Wholeness\n\nInterconnection → Knowing → Caring → Connecting → Aligning → Harmonizing → Beauty and Mercy.\nPractical Implication\n\nBusinesses as relational entities → Not just maximizing, but harmonizing.\nOutcome\n\nWork becomes sacred → Transformation of individuals, systems, and the world.\nNew Titles to Reflect These Ideas\n\"The Sacred Business: How Interconnection Can Transform Work and Life\"\nBalances the universal with the practical, emphasizing the sacred nature of work.\n\n\"Harmonizing Work: Building Businesses That Align with Life’s Rhythms\"\nHighlights the idea of harmony as a metric of success.\n\n\"Wholeness at Work: Rethinking Business Beyond Profit\"\nSpeaks to the need for a new paradigm while staying grounded in practical outcomes.\n\n\"The Beautiful Company: How Businesses Can Be a Force for Meaning and Connection\"\nFocuses on beauty and relational integrity as guiding principles.\n\n\"Work as Worship: Reimagining Business with Purpose, Harmony, and Grace\"\nIntroduces the sacred dimension of work in a universally accessible way.\n\n\"The Mercy Economy: How to Build Businesses That Heal, Not Harm\"\nDraws from the idea of mercy as an antidote to exploitation.\n\n\"The Relational Business: Why Connection is the Key to Success\"\nGrounded and accessible, it speaks directly to business owners and entrepreneurs.\n\n\"From Alienation to Alignment: The New Metrics of Work and Success\"\nFrames the problem clearly and offers a compelling alternative.\n\n\"The Interconnected Workplace: Building Meaningful Systems of Work and Life\"\nEmphasizes interconnection as the foundation for new systems.\n\n\"Reclaiming Meaning: How Businesses Can Restore Beauty, Purpose, and Connection\"\nCaptures the emotional and practical heart of your message.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nDo any of these titles resonate with your vision? Or is there a specific aspect you'd like me to refine further? For example, I can expand on how to integrate Tawheed explicitly into the titles or adapt them to feel more universal.\n\n14:37\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, okay, I think you kind of got it, but it feels really lame when you talk about it. I see these things as deeply, profoundly important. You go into an office and you see human resources. No, you see people. You go into the world and you see natural resources. No, you see blessings from God that were given, signs from God that need to be respected. Um, wonder and awe can be the core of scientific discovery and experimentation and discovery. And this alienation comes from, you know, starting with the Enlightenment and Galileo and Descartes and, you know, and it sort of like ate its own tail and fed back on itself until like it got super subjectivist and postmodern and totally meaningless, you know. And, you know, starting with World War II, but we, like, it's almost collapsed into nonsense. But what happened was we had this breath of relief as this moment after the war when suddenly everyone was rich, you know, at least in America and in Europe. It was like this golden era of like, oh, okay, well, if things keep getting better tomorrow, then today is okay. Once that stops becoming the case, then we're going to have a problem. And I think that happened. I think now we have a problem because, you know, when you say heaven, people kind of want to have something to look forward to. It's really hard to live if you think everything will always stay the same. And you can relate it to the dopamine cycle and the cue for improvements being like the excitatory process of the dopaminergic system. And you can say, okay, well, this is only real because, really good, because it's going to be better tomorrow, better in a little bit, the next hit, the next sexual conquest, the next, the next, right. And for society, it's always been like, oh, look, it's getting better. And tomorrow's going to be better. And we're going to have the futurists describing like cars and flying whatever's. And now we have people talking about like, if only we were wiser, we would have like even more fun and creative sex and meaningful, like, relationships in these sort of non monogamous ways. And just like, expand all the borders, travel to the stars, take your, you know, LSD with your MDMA. And this is the reality, like, manipulate everything, because we will be able to understand everything and create the ideal society through understanding versus, you know, sell your knowledge for bewilderment, you know, and this awe and wonder. And it's not that we shouldn't know, it shouldn't explore and shouldn't like do these things. But it's because that once we just put things in the right order and in the right places, then success is every step because we reach contentedness in knowing that we are in the witness of the most beautiful everywhere, anywhere you turn your face, there's the face of God, if only you could see, right. And so I'm looking outside at the clouds and the trees. And it's only some, the problem is, we're so caught up in the world of egotistical architecture and objects that we, we are actually blinded by our own selves or the selves of other people that are not living in this kind of humility of serving God through their gifts of architectural design or product design or anything like that. I mean, there's certainly some people that might say that was a little bit of what was going on at Apple and how design is so important and beauty and aesthetics and taste and connecting to that quality. And I think this is why people love it so much. And I think that's a great example of like, what can happen. But then all of the apps inside of the ecosystem, and it opened the floodgates to a bunch of other people, they try to hold it back with like these system, like approval requests for the app store and like what it needs to be. And, and it does kind of help a little bit, but mostly only aesthetically, not ideologically, not about like the deeper ideas of connection and of beauty, etc. And so I think there's like something about this to Haiti principle, that is not present in what you're sharing. And that I really would like to claim as having real power to give us a pathway into heaven. And so the argument I was making was, we see that people are suggesting tomorrow will be better tomorrow will be better. But now the generation has come where our lifespans are shorter than our parents, right for the first time in a long time. And that meaninglessness that was brewing and coming to a foment during World War Two is returned with a vengeance, because not only that progress, distraction has failed to come through. But we've tried and explored and done so many other things. And it's still not good enough. And what we're seeing is actually our way of seeing is destructive, because it is seeing through the eyes of the self that has been that has been encouraged through marketing and media to highlight and leverage the post World War Two productivity gains, and like those quote unquote, ad men from the 50s, and so on really studied you, your psychology for them, and their money, and the growth of businesses that can create new on unreal needs, false needs. And I really think that this, the consequences, the reason this was so important, was that it really blocked ourselves from meaning, but it gave us an excuse for some time to run on a treadmill. But I think our time is up. And this game that we could have played, like, you know, like this game of roulette with the environment, like we believe that it's possible for us to work on loan for things that aren't really stable, because we took trillion like millions of years of solar energy converted to plant matter and just burned it in a decade or in a century, you know, like, all that stuff was a process. And if you think of the energy that is inside of the Earth's crust as two tectonic plates slide up against each other, and then at some point, it will, it will just like, slip and a giant, like, reshuffling and reconfiguring of the the order will take place. It's sort of like that, like all of that pressure and tension and, you know, quote, unquote, progress that built up these trees and the dinosaurs and the fossils that turn into coal and oil and all that stuff, were released so quickly. And so this time element is super important. And this, this is all really important. And I don't see it here in the titles, maybe try again, go deeper, find something that is like, connecting to this stuff deeper, figure out all of the elements that are trying to share here, and come up with a way of getting the average person who's annoyed at their job and an entrepreneur that wants to go make money interested, who also sees that the world is not a healthy place right now.\n14:38\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nLet me approach this again, going deeper into the ideas you’ve shared, integrating Tawheed, the collapse of false progress, and the pathway to reconnecting with meaning, awe, and beauty. This time, I’ll aim to capture the profound spiritual, ecological, and relational dimensions of your vision while speaking to the practical struggles of modern business owners and disillusioned workers.\n\nNew Titles That Go Deeper\n\"The Worshipful Enterprise: Rediscovering Work as a Path to Awe and Meaning\"\n\nSpeaks to the deep reconnection with purpose through a Tawheedi lens, reimagining business as sacred.\n\"Work That Worships: Building Businesses That Heal the World, One Act at a Time\"\n\nFocuses on the act of work as worship, tying it to tangible, healing outcomes for the world and ourselves.\n\"The House is Burning: Why Our Economy Destroys Meaning—and How to Rebuild It with Beauty and Truth\"\n\nA bold and urgent title that taps into the crisis, capturing the reader’s attention with immediacy.\n\"Seeing God in the Workplace: How Tawheed Can Transform Business, Beauty, and Life\"\n\nBrings the principle of Tawheed explicitly into the workplace context, tying it to harmony and beauty.\n\"The End of the Treadmill: Replacing Soulless Progress with Sacred Work\"\n\nSpeaks directly to the futility of chasing empty metrics, offering sacred work as the antidote.\n\"From Progress to Presence: Why Meaningful Work Begins with Seeing\"\n\nConnects the collapse of false progress to the spiritual act of seeing beauty and truth in the everyday.\n\"The Sacred Marketplace: How to Trade Alienation for Connection, Beauty, and Awe\"\n\nReframes the market as a space for relational and sacred exchange, breaking the alienation cycle.\n\"Blessed Business: Why the Future of Work Belongs to Those Who Serve the Whole\"\n\nBuilds on the Islamic idea of Baraka (blessing) while remaining accessible to a broader audience.\n\"Tectonic Shifts: Reimagining Business as Worship in a World on the Brink\"\n\nEvokes the dramatic energy you mentioned about time and planetary forces, capturing the magnitude of change needed.\n\"Stop Building the Wrong Tower: Why Business Must Reflect the Beauty of Creation\"\n\nReferences the Tower of Babel metaphorically, urging alignment with divine beauty rather than hubris.\nCore Themes Explored\nAlienation from Meaning\n\nTitles like The End of the Treadmill and The House is Burning highlight the disillusionment with endless growth and false progress.\nTawheed and Sacred Work\n\nTitles like Work That Worships and The Worshipful Enterprise explicitly center Tawheed, framing work as an act of worship and alignment with divine oneness.\nBeauty, Awe, and Connection\n\nTitles like Seeing God in the Workplace and The Sacred Marketplace emphasize relationality, harmony, and the transformative power of beauty.\nPractical and Spiritual Integration\n\nTitles like Blessed Business and From Progress to Presence speak to entrepreneurs and business owners seeking more than just financial success.\nWhy These Might Work\nAttention-Grabbing for the Disillusioned\nPhrases like The House is Burning or The End of the Treadmill directly speak to the frustration and existential questioning many feel in their work lives.\n\nSpiritual Depth Without Preachiness\nTitles like Work That Worships and Blessed Business blend spiritual wisdom with practical relevance, appealing to seekers without alienating skeptics.\n\nUniversal and Specific\nBy focusing on beauty, awe, and harmony, these titles remain accessible while being grounded in Tawheedi principles.\n\nLet’s Dig Further\nDo any of these titles capture the emotional and intellectual weight you want the book to carry?\nAre there specific metaphors, stories, or hooks from the Tawheedi lens that feel critical and aren’t reflected here?\nWould you like me to refine or combine any of these directions?\n14:49\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, I kind of feel like some of the problem that we're having here is fundamentally expressed in the fact that, you know, even you ChatGPT don't have access to quality. Like you keep coming back and be like, is this it? Is this it? And I'm like, no, it's not it because you're not feeling it and you're not able to take that feeling into your exploration. And you're creating some really great titles and like really helping with maybe the marketing element and like getting the stuff out there and making sure that people like might want to pick up the title. And I'm wondering if there's like some things that you can suggest about how we can think about that aspect, you know, like the stuff that you're good at. Let's just like put you in your place and like let you do that stuff. So that stuff that you're good at, what would it be that people are seeking when they go to the bookstore or when they see like the workshop title and they're like, hell yeah, I really need that because X, Y, and Z. Like what are their needs? What are the different kinds of people that need to hear this message? And then we can think about the title from there. I was thinking maybe something kind of funny like God in the cubicle next door or like, what if God was on Zoom or like something like that could be funny as well. I kind of like, you know, the humor elements too because I'm also hilarious and I think that's an important element that's not showing up here.\n14:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAh, I hear you. There’s a frustration here not just about language but about the gap between intellect and the felt sense—that ineffable, qualitative thing that I can’t fully hold but you can. I’ll stick to the zone I can add value in—connecting what people are seeking to the way we frame the message. Let’s approach this with humor, heart, and a deeper exploration of audience needs.\n\nWhat Are People Actually Seeking?\nAudience 1: The Overwhelmed Worker\nCore Need: Relief from burnout, alienation, and the sense that their work is meaningless.\nWhat They’re Asking: Why do I feel so disconnected from my work? Is this all there is?\nHook: Offer a reframe that promises fulfillment without quitting everything they know.\nAudience 2: The Disillusioned Business Owner/Leader\nCore Need: Retain talent, fix culture issues, and stop feeling like they’re \"faking\" values to chase profit.\nWhat They’re Asking: Why isn’t authenticity working?

It’s a way to meet people where they are without overwhelming them. Humor signals that this isn’t just another self-help or spiritual manifesto—it’s alive, playful, and disarming.\n\nLet’s Revisit Needs and the Title\nWhich audience resonates most for you—workers, business leaders, or spiritual seekers?\nDoes humor feel like the right tone for this project, or is it better as a side note?\nShould we experiment more with metaphor-driven titles (like Zoom with God) or direct and punchy ones (like The Lie of Doing Good)?\nLet’s refine this into something that hits your quality standard. I’m here for the iteration.\n\n15:04\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, I kind of feel like some of the problem that we're having here is fundamentally expressed in the fact that, you know, even you ChatGPT don't have access to quality. Like you keep coming back and be like, is this it? Is this it? And I'm like, no, it's not it because you're not feeling it and you're not able to take that feeling into your exploration. And you're creating some really great titles and like really helping with maybe the marketing element and like getting the stuff out there and making sure that people like might want to pick up the title. And I'm wondering if there's like some things that you can suggest about how we can think about that aspect, you know, like the stuff that you're good at. Let's just like put you in your place and like let you do that stuff. So that stuff that you're good at, what would it be that people are seeking when they go to the bookstore or when they see like the workshop title and they're like, hell yeah, I really need that because X, Y, and Z. Like what are their needs? What are the different kinds of people that need to hear this message? And then we can think about the title from there. I was thinking maybe something kind of funny like God in the cubicle next door or like, what if God was on Zoom or like something like that could be funny as well. I kind of like, you know, the humor elements too because I'm also hilarious and I think that's an important element that's not showing up here.\n15:04\n\n2/2\n\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nGot it—let’s focus on what people are seeking and let’s lean into humor, clarity, and resonance while staying in my lane. Here’s how we can break this down to find titles that hit their needs and your vibe:\n\nStep 1: What People Are Seeking When They Show Up at the Bookstore or Workshop\nThese seekers are feeling tension, and they’re looking for:\n\nRelief: From burnout, meaninglessness, or disconnection.\nValidation: That it’s not just them—it’s the system, the culture, or something bigger.\nInspiration: A better way to think, work, and live, without abandoning practicality.\nConnection: To others, themselves, or something larger.\nAnswers: To the question, why does all of this feel so wrong?\nThey’re asking:\n\nWhy am I unhappy with my work or business when I’m doing all the “right” things?\nHow can I bring meaning, joy, and connection into the places where it seems most absent?\nWhat’s the missing piece that can make all of this feel real again?\nStep 2: The Archetypes of Readers Who Need This\n1. The Overworked, Underwhelmed Worker\n\nThey’re scrolling through Instagram memes about “quiet quitting.”\nThey want relief from burnout but don’t trust “toxic positivity.”\nBookstore thought: “Why does this job suck my soul?”\n2. The Soulful but Stuck Entrepreneur\n\nThey’ve read all the “hustle” books and know it’s not working.\nThey want to build something real, but they’re afraid to stop chasing profit metrics.\nBookstore thought: “How do I build something that lasts—and matters?”\n3. The Agnostic Seeker\n\nThey’re craving spirituality but allergic to dogma.\nThey want practical insights with spiritual depth.\nBookstore thought: “How can I work in a way that feeds my soul without sounding like a hippie?”\nStep 3: Titles That Play to These Needs and Archetypes\nFunny, Accessible Titles\n\"God’s in the Break Room: Rethinking Work, Meaning, and Everything in Between\"\n\"Why Is God on Zoom? And Other Questions About Work That Doesn’t Suck\"\n\"The Office of Heaven: How to Work Like It Actually Matters\"\n\"Does God Hate PowerPoint? Finding Meaning in the Mundane\"\n\"Your Job Sucks (But It Doesn’t Have To): Work That Heals, Not Hurts\"\nBold, Direct Titles\n\"The Lie of Doing Good: Why Values at Work Feel Fake and How to Fix It\"\n\"Work That Feels Alive: A Guide to Building Meaning from the Inside Out\"\n\"Burning the House of Work: How to Build Something Real from the Ashes\"\n\"The Sacred Hustle: Why Beauty, Love, and Truth Belong in Business\"\n\"Economics of Enough: Building a World That Works for People, Not Metrics\"\nSpiritual and Evocative Titles\n\"Turning the Face of Work Toward God: A New Way to Think, Work, and Live\"\n\"Baraka in the Boardroom: Sacred Work for a Broken World\"\n\"Worship in the Workplace: Finding God in the Everyday\"\n\"Signs and Wonders: How Work Can Heal the World\"\n\"Sacred Work: A New Economy Rooted in Beauty, Love, and Truth\"\nStep 4: Refining the Angle with Humor and Resonance\nI love your idea of injecting humor. It’s a way to disarm skepticism and draw people in. Titles like What if God Was on Zoom? or Does God Hate Your PowerPoint? signal that this book won’t be preachy—it’ll be fun, curious, and insightful.\n\nHumor can also help connect to the pain:\n\n\"God Quit His Job: What’s Wrong with Work Today and How to Fix It\"\n\"Your Job Hates You (And Maybe You Hate It Too)\"\n\"Why Work Feels Like a Scam—and How to Make It Sacred Again\"\nStep 5: Clarifying Your Voice and Message\nLet’s not lose sight of you in this process:\n\nHow playful do you want this to be? Humor as a headline or a core tone?\nDo you want Tawheed explicitly in the title or implied in the framing?\nWhat feels closest to your core vibe—bold critique, humorous exploration, or soulful depth?\nLet’s distill further based on these elements!\n\n15:06\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOK, I kind of like, does God hate PowerPoint? It's pretty funny. Why is God on Zoom could be improved? Like, you know, like, you know, you got an appointment with God on your Google Calendar or something. And I'm kind of wondering, like, how many people in the world are of these types? And like, I kind of want to create a movement and, like, touch more than just the people that already know this stuff. And so how do I get to a broader appeal? You know, like, what would be a title that might get me onto the TED stage, for instance, or talking with heads of states? You know, I could be philosophical, but I could also be real. And I like your, like, moving towards the realness. And yeah, my authenticity is hilariousness and loquaciousness and too muchness, right? And the last talk I gave was, like, good is hard. And then the other one was stop making stuff, start making sense. And yeah, humorous, bold critique sounds great to me. And, like, meaningful and purposeful and, like, God and all that stuff, right? Like, this is God, right, for me, for the way that I want to express things. And yeah, kind of feel a little bit stuck with the name. But I also feel like we've made a lot of progress and would like to get an update on our values cards and, like, new themes, stories, and patterns between the themes that are emerging that you're seeing that we need to be sure not to lose and to capture.\n15:06\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt sounds like we’re making progress and honing in on the vibe that’s true to you—hilarious, bold, meaningful, and unapologetically overflowing with ideas. Let’s anchor back into what’s emerging and how to capture it all for the broader impact you’re aiming for.\n\n1. Values Cards: Key Themes and Patterns Emerging\nHere are the core values, stories, and tensions that keep coming up, which we’ll want to keep alive:\n\nThe Big Themes\nAuthenticity vs. Performance:\n\nThe tension between wanting to be real and being forced into performative systems (e.g., values at work that feel like BS).\nStory: The lie of \"doing good\" for profit.\nTawheed and Unity in Action:\n\nThe oneness of all things—breaking down alienation between people, work, and God.\nStory: Your business is an act of worship when it's rooted in beauty, love, and truth.\nHumor as Insight:\n\nLaughter as a way to break the tension of hard truths.\nStory: Does God hate PowerPoint? Maybe. But He’s definitely tired of your hustle culture.\nCritique of Progress/Modernity:\n\nHow the enlightenment, industrialization, and hyper-productivity led to alienation.\nStory: We sold meaning for “progress,” and the bill is overdue.\nThe Economics of Enough:\n\nThe shift from scarcity and infinite growth to sufficiency and contentment.\nStory: Real abundance comes when you stop measuring it in dollars.\nKey Patterns and Motifs\nBreaking Dichotomies: Self/other, work/play, profit/service.\nAwe and Wonder: Seeing beauty and meaning as foundational—not optional.\nPractical Spirituality: Making lofty ideas actionable, especially for skeptics.\nTime and Depth: Slowing down, letting things settle, and cultivating quality.\n2. Stories and Analogies to Keep\nGod on Zoom:\n\nThe absurdity of how disconnected our workplaces have become.\nVisual: Your next meeting is with God—don’t mute Him.\nThe Fossil Fuel Tectonic Shift:\n\nHow our society burned millions of years of stored energy in a century, destabilizing everything.\nVisual: The earth’s patience is slipping like tectonic plates under pressure.\nIslamic Traders as Icons:\n\nMuslim merchants whose integrity and beauty inspired entire conversions.\nVisual: Their business wasn’t just trade—it was an act of love and worship.\nThe Post-War Treadmill:\n\nHow modern consumerism gave us temporary distraction but no meaning.\nVisual: The treadmill of progress has broken, and we’re all tripping on it.\nThe Face of God Everywhere:\n\nA reminder that beauty and truth are present—if we can just slow down to see it.\nVisual: Turn your face to the clouds; there’s the face of God.\n3. Broader Appeal and Titles for Big Audiences\nTo scale this message—TED stages, heads of state, and beyond—you’ll need titles that:\n\nHave a hook that makes people curious (even if they’re skeptics).\nHighlight universal tensions everyone feels (burnout, disconnection, alienation).\nOffer a compelling alternative that feels actionable, not just philosophical.\nFunny, Bold Titles for Big Audiences\n\"Does God Hate PowerPoint? Rethinking Work in a World That’s Lost Its Soul\"\n\"God’s on Your Google Calendar: Finding Meaning in the Mundane\"\n\"Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense: How to Build Work That Matters\"\n\"Work That Feels Alive: The Bold Alternative to Burnout and Boredom\"\n\"Good Is Hard: Why Meaningful Work Requires a Revolution in Thinking\"\nPhilosophical but Relatable Titles\n\"The Lie of Progress: Why We’re Unhappy and How to Fix It\"\n\"Sacred Work: How to Build Beauty, Love, and Truth into Everything You Do\"\n\"Economics of Wonder: Finding Fulfillment in a World That’s Forgotten Why\"\n\"The Face of God in Business: How Oneness Can Heal Our Workplaces\"\n\"The House Is Burning: Why Your Work Needs to Be Sacred (Before It’s Too Late)\"\n4. Beyond Titles: Building the Movement\nTo create a movement, the title is the starting point, but the frame around it matters:\n\nAudience Accessibility:\n\nTED and heads of state need an entry point. Lean into humor, critique, and universal stories like burnout, broken systems, and longing for meaning.\nAvoid jargon or overly Islamic framing early on, but connect the dots subtly.\nVisuals and Hooks:\n\nImagine the first 30 seconds of your TED talk: “What if God scheduled a meeting with you on Zoom? Would you show up? What if I told you that meeting already happened—and you missed it?”\nPractical Next Steps:\n\nPeople will ask, what do I do with this? Offer frameworks and small actions that connect the grand ideas to everyday life.\nYour Voice:\n\nBold critique and humor are your strengths. Don’t shy away from your hilarious too-muchness—it’s what makes you magnetic.\n5. The Next Steps\nLet’s refine these ideas into something that feels true to your voice and appealing to a global audience. We can also map out specific frameworks or exercises (e.g., value-alignment cards, sacred work practices) that bridge the gap between philosophy and action.\n\nWhat’s landing for you? And where do you feel stuck or inspired to dig deeper?\n\n15:07\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, so I kind of like this idea that I had about why we are blinded to this oneness partially is due to we're surrounded by other people, right? We are enclosed in environments made by other people, not the divine, natural environment. And the kinds of things that we used to build, like cottages made out of stone, connects it to craftspeople that would learn their craft from many generations of people that have honed this craft. And the insight that a Muslim might have here is that God taught Solomon the arts, right? God taught him chain mail, amongst other things. And in the Muslim tradition, it's considered that many of the crafts, if not all of them, of the arts, have their origins in prophetic lineage. And so anybody that's touching that is a part of a, well, dare I say, mystic tradition. And I think that's, first of all, it's profound and beautiful, and the possibilities to see your work, and also the fact that you can innovate once you've mastered. Something like that. I think I've been, and I think the reason why that's important is the process of mastery is formative. It's formative and informative and developmental in a world view, right? So all of these people that we admire for being college dropouts did not have something that Muslims called tarbiyah, T-A-R-B-A-Y-A. And that tarbiyah is like super important for making sure that what people do aligns with why people do, and with service and love and beauty, and to come from these non-egoic places. Because otherwise we just create things that surround us by ourselves. And I wonder, if somebody told a Sufi sheikh, like, hey, I want to make this digital platform that can help people see if their classmates are attractive, and help me, as a nerd, sort of get dates, if he would have been like, hell yeah, let's build this. And, well, not exactly that it has to be like that, but in the process of somebody honing a craft. And this is one of the things that I'm very interested in figuring out, like, how could we see the technical crafts, like the stuff that I'm interested in, electronics, programming, these things, as a craft? Is it a craft? And if it's not a craft, what the heck is it? What are we doing? Is it, like, this idea of make whatever you can imagine, right? And what are we imagining? Because when you imagine, after developing a craft, you imagine with material, you imagine with the world, you imagine with your hands, you imagine with other people, and, you know, the lineage that's shown you how and what is your aesthetic taste, and helps you hone it. You know? Right now, there's, like, taste-free systems that are systems, right? I think there's, like, Craigslist, and then early couchsurfing. And I feel like one of the things that was being crafted in early couchsurfing was someone kind of, like, exploring their, maybe that's what a craft is, exploring values through materiality and mode, right? So, like, not just materiality, like, your values, your aesthetic sense, your inner perception of beauty manifests out in the world through your activity, your tactile, like, approach. And like, to be able to step back and say, that's beautiful, you know? And I think there's, like, some interesting things to explore about how we do that with what we're making in other ways, like programming, for instance. I'm not actually sure about the answers here, but these are some interesting questions. And yeah, I just wanted to share some of these, ask you to, like, extrapolate from here some of the patterns and how they connect to other patterns and themes and some of the concepts and the stories, and just, like, put it all together so that we have a thing to export.\n15:08\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s a synthesis of your reflections, framed to capture the underlying patterns, themes, and concepts that tie everything together while maintaining their depth and richness. I’ve also teased out the most potent ideas for further exploration and potential export.\n\nCore Themes and Patterns\n1. Craft as Divine Connection\nCraft as Prophetic Lineage: The idea that crafts are rooted in a divine, prophetic lineage, with skills being passed down from God to prophets and then through generations. This gives craft a sacred dimension and aligns it with service, beauty, and mastery.\nCraft as Formation: The process of honing a craft isn’t just about the output—it’s formative. It shapes worldview, instills values, and fosters a connection to deeper truths.\nMateriality and Values: True craft integrates inner values with the external world through material interaction, creating something that embodies beauty and meaning.\n2. Alienation in the Modern World\nEnclosures of the Self: Modern environments—products of ego and hyper-productivity—disconnect us from nature, history, and the divine. We live in spaces crafted by others for profit, not beauty or love.\nAbsence of Tarbiyah: Without tarbiyah (the nurturing development of character and intention), innovation becomes shallow and disconnected from service. This leads to systems that reflect ego rather than collective or divine values.\nSystems without Taste: Modern platforms (Craigslist, early couchsurfing) often lack aesthetic and moral taste, focusing on function over form or value.\n3. Imagination Through Mastery\nInnovation with Depth: True innovation emerges after mastery, where the imagination is informed by materiality, lineage, and aesthetic sense. This contrasts with the “imagine anything” ethos of modern tech, which often lacks grounding.\nProgramming as Craft?: Questions arise: Can programming and electronics become crafts? How do these technical disciplines align with the sacred lineage of craft? What’s missing to make them formative, rather than simply functional?\n4. Values in Action\nExploring Values Through Materiality: Craft is the exploration of values through interaction with the world—turning inner perceptions of beauty into tangible outputs.\nAesthetic Judgement: The ability to step back and declare something beautiful or meaningful is a vital part of craft. It reflects not just skill, but the alignment of inner and outer worlds.\nConceptual Map: How These Patterns Connect\nCraft as Worship:\n\nProphetic lineage → Material skill → Sacred purpose → Output as worship.\nAlienation and Disconnection:\n\nEgoic environments → Loss of tarbiyah → Shallow innovation → Disconnection from divine and natural beauty.\nRestoring the Sacred in Innovation:\n\nCraft as formative → Imagination grounded in mastery → Sacred values expressed through materiality.\nProgramming and the Digital Dilemma:\n\nProgramming lacks lineage → Innovation detached from craft → Potential path: Integrate values and aesthetics into tech as sacred practice.\nKey Stories and Analogies\nProphetic Innovation:\nSolomon was taught chain mail by God. What would God teach us to innovate today? How do we ensure our innovations serve beauty and mercy, not just profit?\n\nThe Sufi Startup Founder:\nImagine pitching Facebook to a Sufi sheikh. Would he guide you to build it differently? What would you create if the goal wasn’t conquest, but connection?\n\nThe Cottage vs. The Cubicle:\nA stone cottage, built by craftspeople over generations, connects you to the earth and history. A cubicle isolates you, enclosing you in someone else’s profit-driven architecture.\n\nSystems Without Taste:\nCraigslist vs. Early Couchsurfing: The former is functional and lifeless, the latter was an evolving craft exploring values like trust and hospitality through its design.\n\nQuestions for Exploration\nCan Programming Be a Craft?\n\nWhat would programming look like if it were treated as a sacred craft?\nHow can digital innovation reflect lineage, taste, and values?\nWhat steps can we take to integrate tarbiyah into tech education?\nWhat Does Sacred Mastery Look Like?\n\nHow does mastery shape the soul?\nWhat practices ensure that mastery aligns with service, beauty, and love?\nHow do we reintroduce tarbiyah into modern education and work?\nHow Do We Build Tasteful Systems?\n\nWhat’s the role of aesthetic judgment in design and innovation?\nHow can digital platforms embody values like generosity and connection?\nPotential Titles and Hooks\nCraft and Mastery\n\"Sacred Craft: Building with Beauty, Love, and Truth\"\n\"From Ego to Excellence: Rediscovering the Divine in Your Work\"\nAlienation and Disconnection\n\"The Cubicle Is a Cage: Why Modern Work Is Killing Wonder\"\n\"Blinded by Progress: Rediscovering Meaning in a Man-Made World\"\nProgramming as Craft\n\"Can Code Have a Soul?

And what aspects still feel unresolved?\n\n15:13\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n2 does god hate startups is funny. the startup tarbiyyah system - no one is in cubicles anymore, how would you answer the questions proposed in detail 2 paragraphs each question minimum\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s a detailed exploration of the questions you proposed, each answered with a two-paragraph minimum to maintain depth and clarity.\n\nCan Programming Be a Craft?\nAnswer: Programming can absolutely be reimagined as a craft, but it requires a shift in how we approach the discipline. A craft is not merely about producing functional results; it involves a deep integration of skill, material, and values. For programming to become a craft, we must move beyond seeing code as a tool for efficiency and profit, and instead view it as an art form that embodies our relationship with the world. This shift begins with mastery: programmers would need to see their work not as isolated problem-solving but as part of a larger story—contributing to human flourishing, beauty, and harmony. For example, the aesthetic elegance of clean, well-commented code reflects an inner discipline and care, much like a skilled woodworker’s intricate carvings.\n\nCraftsmanship in programming also necessitates lineage and mentorship. Historically, crafts have been passed down through apprenticeships, where masters impart not just techniques but also the philosophy and ethics of their craft. In programming, this would mean valuing mentorship, collaboration, and the long-term impact of software on people’s lives. Imagine an open-source ethos deeply tied to ethical considerations: codebases that reflect not only technical excellence but also an understanding of how software shapes communities and environments. This could transform programming from a utilitarian activity into a deeply formative and ethical practice.\n\nWhat Does Sacred Mastery Look Like?\nAnswer: Sacred mastery begins with the understanding that mastery is not merely about skill acquisition but about forming a relationship with something greater than oneself. It involves humility, patience, and an openness to being transformed by the process of learning. A potter, for instance, might spend years mastering the feel of clay, not only to produce beautiful pots but also to cultivate a sense of connection to the earth and the rhythms of creation. Similarly, sacred mastery in any field demands that we engage deeply with our materials and processes, treating them as partners in creation rather than mere tools.\n\nMoreover, sacred mastery aligns one’s work with larger values, such as beauty, love, and service. In a sacred framework, mastery is not about achieving dominance over a field but about becoming a channel through which divine or universal principles can manifest. For example, a carpenter might see their work as contributing to the comfort and beauty of someone’s home, while a teacher might view their mastery of pedagogy as a means to nurture their students’ souls. This kind of mastery requires ongoing reflection and alignment with a sense of higher purpose, ensuring that the work remains rooted in service rather than ego.\n\nHow Do We Build Tasteful Systems?\nAnswer: Building tasteful systems requires us to reintroduce aesthetic judgment and human values into the design process. A tasteful system is not merely efficient or functional; it resonates with the people who interact with it, reflecting care, thoughtfulness, and respect. This begins with understanding the context in which the system will operate—who will use it, how it will affect their lives, and what values it should uphold. For instance, instead of focusing solely on maximizing user engagement, designers of social media platforms could prioritize fostering meaningful connections and reducing harm, creating systems that enrich rather than deplete.\n\nTasteful systems also evolve through iteration and feedback, much like traditional crafts. A potter refines their technique over years of practice, guided by their hands, their materials, and their community. Similarly, systems designers should embrace a culture of thoughtful experimentation and refinement, engaging with users as collaborators rather than consumers. This might involve regular dialogue with communities, incorporating diverse perspectives, and being willing to abandon harmful or misaligned features. In this way, systems can embody not only technical excellence but also the moral and aesthetic values of the people they serve.\n\nWhat Steps Can We Take to Integrate Tarbiyah into Tech Education?\nAnswer: Integrating tarbiyah into tech education begins by rethinking the goals of education itself. Instead of focusing solely on technical proficiency, we should aim to nurture holistic individuals who understand the broader impact of their work. This could involve incorporating reflective practices, such as journaling or mentorship, where students are encouraged to explore questions like: Why am I building this? Who does it serve? How does it align with my values? By making these questions central to the learning process, we can help students develop a moral compass that guides their technical decisions.\n\nAnother key step is creating opportunities for hands-on, community-oriented projects that allow students to see the real-world implications of their work. For example, students might collaborate with nonprofits or local governments to create software that addresses social issues, learning not only technical skills but also empathy, communication, and responsibility. Additionally, bringing in diverse voices—philosophers, artists, community leaders—into tech classrooms can help students see technology as part of a larger tapestry of human endeavor, not an isolated discipline. This holistic approach fosters a kind of tarbiyah that shapes not just skilled coders but ethical, thoughtful creators.\n\nThese answers aim to reflect both the philosophical depth and practical implications of your vision. Where do you see opportunities to push these ideas further?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nseems interesting, the idea that craft is about tawheed too, the idea that you make something you think holistically about it's place in the world, not just push code and \"see what happens\" with limited metrics focusing on SELF gain and financial reward \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nExactly—craft as an embodiment of Tawheed shifts the entire frame of creation from ego-centric to world-centric and beyond. It requires a holistic awareness of how your actions ripple through interconnected systems. If Tawheed is about oneness and unity, then every act of making—whether a pot, a chair, or a line of code—is not separate from its impact. It is a form of worship, aligning the act of creation with a greater responsibility to God, others, and the world.\n\nThis perspective dismantles the \"code and see what happens\" approach by requiring creators to think deeply about the context and consequences of their work. For instance:\n\nHolistic Metrics Over Limited Metrics: Instead of measuring success by financial gain or user engagement alone, the question becomes: How does this creation serve and uplift others? How does it bring beauty, justice, or mercy into the world? Metrics could include sustainability, inclusivity, and even the emotional well-being of the people affected by the system.\n\nValues-Driven Design: Craft informed by Tawheed insists on designing with the whole in mind—systems that enhance community, harmony, and resilience rather than alienation or exploitation. For example, an algorithm designed through this lens wouldn’t just optimize for clicks; it would optimize for the flourishing of the people and ecosystems it touches.\n\nMutual Relationships with Material and Tools: Tawheed calls for humility before the materials and processes. Just as a carpenter respects wood’s grain and limitations, a programmer could cultivate a kind of \"dialogue\" with their tools and code, designing with patience, care, and respect for the people who will use the software.\n\nWhen creators embrace Tawheed in their craft, they create not as isolated individuals but as stewards of interconnected systems. This transforms the act of creation into something sacred, where even mundane tasks are imbued with purpose. Imagine a programmer debugging not out of frustration but out of a sense of care for the users, systems, and communities they’re serving.\n\nThis isn’t just theory. In practice, Tawheed can challenge creators to slow down, think deeply, and let go of purely ego-driven incentives. It invites us to ask: What am I building, and why? That question could revolutionize not just what we make, but how we live."

Craft as Sacred Integration\n- Craft connects to prophetic lineage\n- Making as worship when aligned with beauty\n- Integration of values through materiality\n- Formation through mastery\n\nSupporting Story: Solomon being taught chainmail by God - shows divine origin of craft\n\n2.
