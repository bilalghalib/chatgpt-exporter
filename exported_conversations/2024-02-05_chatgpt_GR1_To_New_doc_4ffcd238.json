According to Articles 10 and 11 of the Law, any project that could result in negative environmental impacts shall be prohibited from carrying out its activities without the prior approval of the Ministry of Environment (MoEn), and the project owner should submit an EIA study prior to the commencement of any project activities. The provisions of the Law are applicable to existing establishments as well as their proposed expansions or upgrades (Article 12 of the Law).\n\n\nBased on the nature of the project activities, its potential impacts and the surrounding sensitive environmental receptors, the EIA in hand was categorized according to the World Bank's definition as a Category B Environmental Assessment. This category refers to projects which have specific and localized environmental impacts and are not located in environmentally-sensitive areas.\n\nThe EIA team conducted desktop research and reviewed information that was made available for the project location within the city of Baghdad. The team also utilized satellite images to acquire further understanding of the project and its surrounding environmental and socio-economic situation.\n\nThe project activities, their impacts and specific mitigation measures are summarized in this report along with the necessary monitoring requirements. The report also indicates the roles and responsibilities for implementing the mitigation and monitoring measures. The environmental management and monitoring plan is intended to be practical and will need to be periodically reviewed and updated during the lifetime of the project. As such, it will serve as the cornerstone for ensuring the implementation of the EIA recommendations and any adjustments where and when deemed necessary in the future.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AREA\t\nThe proposed facility will be located in west bank of Tigris river in Baghdad.\n\nThe city had a remarkable urban development, but at the same time chaotic also as a consequence of the difficult war conditions, which allowed the phenomenon of illegal building. A phenomenon that, in fact, not taking into account the urban planning tools, has left an important scar on the territory not only from the point of view of the disorganization of the building but also of the insufficiency of the services offered.\n\nIn the recent remarkable reconstruction and order work that the Iraqi state is carrying out, an important part are the hygienic works and the purification service.\n\nAn important portion of the city's urban waste is absorbed by the Al-Kanshaa platform which currently reaches the Tigris river without purifying actions.\n\nThe new treatment plant will receive the sewage from the eastern portion of the big city with an important population density estimated at around 1,000,000 inhabitants. The new Al-Kanshaa plant will, due to its location and urban structure, become an integral part of the territory with the necessary attention to urban, environmental, historical and landscape data. The requirements will accommodate projected wastewater flows from both the present conveyance area limits and the future hypothetical improvements of the areas within the planning horizon for design that it is assumed to be 200,000 m3/day.\n\n\n\nThe objective of implementing the proposed facility is lift the sewage waters coming from sewage line North Eastern and to be treated and drained to Dyala river after treatment with the possibility of benefiting from treated waters for other reasons such irrigation, also, the possibility of using the waste resulting from treatment project to be used as organic compost in agricultural fields.\n\nConsidering the serious criticalities of the purification platform, and considering the ambitious goal of guaranteeing the quality of the waters of Dyala and Tigris rivers, STECI srl wants to face the design through the use of modern and effective analysis tools and software that take into consideration the parameters characteristic of the local reality in which the intervention is prefigured.\n\n\nThe service area for the wastewater collection system is presented in the next figure. The total surface of service area to build the WWTP, pointed out by hatch, is 126.607 m2 (48 dunums).\n\n\n\n\nThe WWTP will consist of three main areas each dedicated respectively to primary, biological and final treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK\t\nThe Iraqi Environmental Protection and Enhancement Law No. 27 for 2009 is the main legal document that outlines the environmental considerations for any project or activity to be carried out in the Country. However, there are other legislations that tackle specific environmental components.\n\nThis subsection will provide an overview of the legal requirements alongside the corresponding environmental component. Law No. 27 for 2009 will be presented in more details as it provides the requirements essential for obtaining environmental clearance for the project.\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENHANCEMENT LAW NO. 27 FOR 2009 \nAs explained previously, Law No. 27 for 2009 states that projects that might result in negative environmental impacts shall conduct an EIA prior to their commencement. Article 10 within the Law states that the EIA report should include positive and negative impacts of the project on its surrounding and vice versa. In addition, the EIA should propose mitigation measures that shall ensure environmental compliance.\n\nFurthermore, the Law also stipulates (through Article 9) that any establishment that will result in environmental pollution shall be committed to undertake the following measures:\n\nProvide and implement pollution control measures using clean technologies, this is to be associated to ensuring the proper performance of these control measures\nProvide tools for measuring the levels of pollutants. Records should be kept and made available to MoEn when needed. If such tools cannot be provided by the establishment, the MoEn performs these measurements\nBuild a database for environmental protection and sustainability\nReduce pollution through using renewable energy technologies\n\n\n\nOTHER LEGISLATIONS\t\nThis sub-section will present other legislations under the relevant environmental component.\n\nWATER AND WASTEWATER\n\nRegulation for the Protection of Water Resources No. 2 for 2001\nRegulation for Protection of Rivers from Pollution No. 25 for 1967 and its amendment in 2001\nRegulation for the Discharge of Wastewater No. 29 for 1934 and its amendments No. 35 for the same year\n\n\n\n\nOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY\nPublic Health Law No. 89 for 1981\nInstructions No. 4 for 1989 (issued by virtue of the Public Health Law) for the Storage and Handling of Chemical Substances\n\nARCHAEOLOGY\n\n\nThe Law of Antiquities and Heritage No. 55 for 2002\n\nINTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND TREATIES\n\n\nIraq is part of a number of international conventions and treaties that aim to protect its environmental wealth. These include:\n\nConvention on the Protection of World Cultural Heritage and Natural Heritage\nConvention to Combat Desertification\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)\nConvention on Protection of Migratory Species of Wild Animals\nRAMSAR Convention on the Protection of Wetlands and Wetland Values\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE\t\n\nCLIMATE\t\nBaghdad has geographical coordinates 333°N and 44.4°E. Winds reaching the city are generally dry and because of the aridity and the relatively cloudless skies, there are large variations in daily temperature as well as between seasons and regions.\n\nClimate and meteorology are studied in order to have environmental parameters as guide for WWTP treatments.\n\nThe climate of Baghdad is arid, subtropical, and continental. The mean maximum temperature in July and August is about 43°C, which could reach up to 49°C in hot seasons. Dust storms are common in summer and the winter is chilly. The mean annual rainfall ranges from about 120 mm in the south to about 160 mm in the northeast. Prevailing wind direction is Northwestern. And an exceptional flood is expected every 30 years.\n\nTEMPERATURE\n\n\nBilal, Al-Jumaily, A.Habbib, 2013 in their published study examined the trends of the monthly, seasonal and annual Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean time series for Baghdad, for the period 1941–2000. The most important aspects of their results are the significant increase in Tmax and Tmean during the spring season and a significant decrease in all three temperatures during the autumn season.\n\nFrom: Dheyaa A. Bilal, Kais J. Al-Jumaily, Enas A.Habbib - Air temperature trends in Baghdad, Iraq for the period 1941-2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Dheyaa A. Bilal, Kais J. Al-Jumaily, Enas A.Habbib - Air temperature trends in Baghdad, Iraq for the period 1941-2000\n\n\n\nTo complete the temperature analysis Muter, Kadhum, Hassan published a study in which they characterized the summer season. In their study, dthey escribe monthly air temperatures for Baghdad’s hot season using statistical method for maximum temperatures and understand the behavior of begin early summer and check changes in the length and the strength of Baghdad’s hot season between 1970 and 2017, especially the changes that change in May. Thirty years of data is long enough to calculate an average that is not influenced by year-to- year variability.\n\nFigures above are taken from Muter, Kadhum, Hassan Approaching of May maximum surface air temperature to characteristic summer season for Baghdad city study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of Baghdad location, climate change, increased air temperature, and variation of surface air temperature lead to increased maximum air temperature for all season particularly in spring make may approaching to summer season. The behavior of air temperature for Baghdad city during the summer months tends to increase despite the fluctuations between the increase and decrease. Such observations are consistent with global trends in temperature.\n\nAnalyzing temperature data from hydrologic years is possible to calculate maximum, minimum and mean temperature values.\n\nHUMIDITY\n\n\nAtmospheric humidity is a term that describes the amount of water vapor in the air, and the distinction between dry and wet air in the atmosphere is through the presence of water vapor or not. Water vapor is the invasive state of moisture in the atmosphere it is the most present condition in the atmosphere, where water is also present in a liquid form, such as cloud droplets or raindrops in a solid state such as snow and hail. The amount of moisture in the air varies with humidity, depending on the temperature and air pressure, as the air humidity is directly proportional to the temperature and inversely with air pressure. The warmer air, the more water vapor it carries because the high air pressure lowers the evaporation process by preventing the evaporated particles from escaping from the water surface to the atmosphere, and when the air contains the maximum amount of water vapor that can carry it under a certain temperature and pressure, then it is said that the air has been saturated with water vapor.\n\nWater vapor pressure: It is the partial pressure of water vapor as a gas component of the atmosphere.\nAbsolute humidity: The amount of weight of water vapor present in the air at a specific temperature.\nSpecific humidity: It is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the mass of moist air that is associated with it.\nDew point: It is the temperature at which water vapor begins to condense\nMixing ratio: Is the ratio between the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air with which water vapor is associated\n\n\n\nRelative humidity: The ratio of the real vapor pressure to the saturated vapor pressure at air temperature.\n\nRelative humidity is the most common way of expressing air humidity, as it is a measure of the degree to which the air approaches the saturation of water vapor. If the air contains half of the amount of water vapor that it can carry only, then this humidity equals 50%, and the air is saturated with moisture that associated with shrouding in clouds and fog then the relative humidity in this case is 100%. In addition, the lower air layers over the oceans are saturated with humidity that reaches 100%. In the Sahara Desert and the subtropical desert regions, the relative humidity drops to only 10%. There are several ways to measure them, including: 1- Hygrometer with dry and wet probes. 2- The capillary hygrometer.\n\nThe high temperature with high humidity increases the transform of heat from the air to the body and at the same time impedes evaporation, which makes the body does not cool quickly and its temperature becomes annoying. But during cold weather, high humidity increases the transfer of heat from the body to the surrounding atmosphere, which causes the body to lose a portion of its heat at the time when it needs such heat. Long periods of heat or long periods of cold have a significant impact on the vital signs of a person. Hence, we conclude that high temperature and extreme cold are harmful to human health because the human body will maintain its internal temperature, which is 37 ºC. Whereas, high and low humidity are also harmful to human health. The humid atmosphere helps the growth of bacteria, germs, and causes laziness and lethargy, but the moderate-humid air is comfortable and healthy and is better than wet or dry air. The relative humidity of a region differs greatly during the day, even though the amount of water vapor in the air remains the same, and in such cases the relative humidity changes when the temperature increases or decreases, the relative humidity may be higher in the morning, when the temperature is low and the air is unable to carry more water vapor than it did at that time, but when the temperature increases during the day, the air becomes able to carry more water vapor, thus reducing the amount of relative humidity. As the air cools under a specified pressure and a constant amount of water vapor, it reaches a temperature with which it becomes saturated. This temperature called the dew point, but if the temperature is lower than that, the water vapor begins to condense and clouds, fog, or Dew. Thus, the lower the air temperatures relative to the amount of dew in it, the higher the relative humidity.\n\nAtmospheric humidity in the atmosphere increases directly with increasing temperature, that is, the higher the temperature, the higher the air humidity. For this reason, the humidity in the tropical regions increases, while in the Polar Regions decreases. It also increases in marine areas compared to land areas. The same can be said when comparing low areas (high humidity) and high areas (low humidity). The temperature is also affected by the humidity. Water vapor is a gas that absorbs thermal energy. The temperature of the gaseous envelope saturated with water vapor decreases by 1 km / 5 ° C, while decreases by 1 km / 10 ° C in case of non-saturated water vapor. In addition, the humidity decreases as the height increases because 90% of the water in the atmosphere is concentrated in the first five kilometers. This phenomenon is explained by moving away from water sources. The weight of water plays a fundamental role in the presence of this substance near the surface of the globe.\n\nWeather and Climate in Iraq has a hot climate in most of spring, summer, and autumn months. Average temperatures in Iraq range from above 39 ° C in July and August to below zero in January. Figure below shows the annual average temperature in Iraq. Most of the rains occur from November and December until the end of\n\n\n\nApril, and the most abundant ones are in the mountainous region in northern Iraq. The summer months are accompanied by dry Southern and Southeastern winds, as well as dusty winds that occur from April to June and second from late September to November and Northern and Northwestern winds prevail from mid-June to mid- September, where dust storms accompany these winds. The climate in the Western and Southern desert regions is characterized by hot Summers and cold Winters. This region also experiences short violent rainstorms in Winter. As for the Southeastern region, most of its rain is accompanied by thunderstorms in Winter and early Spring. The average annual average rainfall for this region is around 10-17 cm, and half of the Winter days are cloudy, and in Summer the weather is clear except for periods of dust storms in Norther part of Iraq. The Kurdistan region, there is mountains that extend in the North and Northeast of Iraq, and the region's climate is characterized by mild Summers and cold Winters, and rain occurs mainly here in Winter and Spring, and is also accompanied by falling amounts of snow in many places.\n\n\nWIND\n\n\nAtmospheric temperature changes due to the effects of solar radiation cause differences in atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the wind will be created according to the movement of air. The wind is generated by pressure differences so that air moves from places of high pressure to others with low pressure. Each of the direction, speed, and gustiness are features of the wind. The wind is not seen, so we see things being moved by it. Then the movement of objects as air passes them is an indication of wind direction. Anemometers are used\n\n\n\nto measure wind speed. Beaufort scale can be used by ordinary people to indicate the speed of the wind from its influence on surroundings. The Coriolis force increases when the wind speed increase. The stronger the wind, the greater the deflection. Coriolis force is one of the important factors that affect wind speed. The direction of the wind is an important factor in the siting of a wind energy conversion system. It is reported by the direction from which it originates. The power that can be extracted from the wind is one of the reliable sources to minimize the dependence on fossil fuel-generated electricity. Wind power can be generated by using wind turbines. In Iraq, Wind energy can be classified into three zones, 48% of Iraq has low annual wind speed, 35% has annual wind speed 3.1e4.9 m/s, 8% has relatively high annual wind speed, and the residual has calm values. The diurnal pattern of wind speed in Iraq has peak values at mid-day and early hours of the morning, the peak values of wind speed varies in the range 5e10 m/s. The use of wind as a source of energy is becoming popular because it is clean and renewable. There is a pressing need in Iraq to develop site-based technology on wind energy, which can be used for the optimal design of wind farms. Therefore, many papers and researches have been carried out to analyze the statistical wind speed data obtained from measurements along a period of 25 years at 9 sites in Iraq, to indicate the superior sites among the selected sites with respect to the wind speed as well as knowing the best periods of wind speed during the year. A lot of research has been done around the world in the field of data mining for site assessment. Data mining using ARIMA or any other technique has been employed to analyzing wind speed data, wind speed prediction, and wind speed modeling for a wind farm and cost estimation. The time series for wind speed were used for different parts from Iraq in this work to draw map covering all region of Iraq which is located in the south-west of Asia between (29e37 N) and (39e48 E).\n\nThe monthly wind speed average data were obtained from Iraqi meteorological organization and seismology (IMOS) for (9) Stations. These data were analyzed using an arc map program, which is one of the Geographic Information System programs. Arc map was used to analyze the monthly mean wind speed for several stations (Mosul, Kirkuk, Khanqin, Baghdad, Hai, Dewaniya, Amara, Nasiriya, and Basrah), which are located at the north, middle and south of Iraq respectively for the period from (1985e2010). This period was divided into five parts from 1985 into 2010. The steps of each part are five years. Every year in this period (1985,1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010) was divided into four months (Dec., Mar., Jul., Oct.), which correlate to the four seasons. The Tables 1e4 containing data averages of wind speed for the nine stations, which show the spatial distribution for data sorted by seasons showing the temporal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAINFALL\n\n\nThe present chapter aims to analyze the trend and forecast annual rainfall in Baghdad for the period of 1979- 2019. Abd Al-Ghani and Mohammed Ali (2020) study Trend of Rain in Iraq show that rainy season tends to decrease in almost stations but Baghdad station tended to rise, as the rate of change in it reached (21.6+, 10.9\n+) mm during the fall and spring seasons respectively.\n\nData have been acquired a mainly monthly average of rainfall data from the Iraqi Meteorological Organization and seismology (IMOS). The long-term data of the monthly average rainfall for the time period 1979-2019 were collected from the Baghdad station. Monthly rainfall for 39 years for Baghdad city is available which covers 24 years are continuous data from 1979 to 2002, two years missing (2003-2004) and 15 years to 2019 are continuous. The daily rainfall behavior varies widely from the extreme values 89 mm in Baghdad to the minimum\nmm in addition to the persisting of rain for one day and up to more than four days but most of the non-rainy\n\n\n\ndays in the year (Abd, Abdulkareem, 2020). The behavior of annual rainfall in Baghdad varies greatly as shown in next figure.\n\n\n\nAnnual rainfall series for Baghdad city (1979-2019)\nFrom: Khtan, Al-Atabi - Analyzing and prediction of rainfall trends over Baghdad city\n\n\nAnalyzing precipitation data from hydrologic years is possible to calculate maximum, minimum and mean annual precipitation values:\n\nMaximum:\t296.7 mm\nMinimum:\t57.6 mm\nMean:\t125.3 mm\nMonthly, seasonal, and annual data of precipitation for the study period were used to calculate percentile-based indices. Precipitation data were represented by the 25th percentile to describe extreme dry conditions and the 90th for extreme wet conditions. Results show that precipitation amounts between 10 and 20 mm had the greatest frequency; daily precipitation amounts between 90 and 100 mm occurred only once at Baghdad station (Naqi, Al-Jiboori, Al-Madhhachi, 2021). The 90th percentile was 17 mm while the total accumulated precipitation during the period was 2380.2 mm.\n\n\n\n\n\nWATER  RESOURCES\t\nThere are surface water bodies within the project area. The groundwater bodies within the project area were found to have a shallow water table. Thus, water which has percolated into the soil reaches groundwater at a higher rate.\n\nDIYALA RIVER\n\n\nDiyala River is a tributary of Tigris River, it is one of the important rivers in Iraq. The Diyala River originates near Sanandaj in the Zagros Mountains in Iran, forming the Iran-Iraq border for over 30 km. With a total length of 574 km, 17 the river has a drainage area of 33,240 km2, of which 25% are located in Iran and 75% in Iraq (see next Overview Map). The Diyala joins the Tigris 15 km south of Baghdad (see next Overview Map). Its principal tributaries are the Tanjeru, Sirwan and Wand Rivers.\n\nThe Diyala stream-flow is very similar to that of the Lesser Zab. It is characterized by peak flows in April and a low-flow season from July until November.\n\nDiyala river, downstream tributary to the south of Baghdad of Tigris river, has a mean daily flow of 182 m3/s at the confluence with Tigris.\n\nFrom: UN-ESCWA and BGR (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia; Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe). 2013. Inventory of Shared Water Resources in Western Asia. Beirut.\n\n\n\n\nGROUNDWATER\n\nIn general, groundwater is widely used for irrigation, industrial activities, drinking, and domestic purposes. Rapid growth of population, urbanization, industrialization, and agriculture activities increase its exploitation, reduce availability, and enhance vulnerability to contaminate the quality of water.\n\nAn attempt has been made to assess the overall groundwater quality and identify major variables affecting the groundwater quality in the urban area of Baghdad. Groundwater samples from tube wells were analyzed for the major physicochemical variables by Alhassan H. Ismail, Muntasir A.H. and Reem J. Channo who published their results in Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part (A),No.2, 2015.\n\nThe Authors, from the Hill–Piper trilinear diagram observed that the majority of ground water from sampling sites are Ca2+ -Mg2+ -Cl- -SO 42- type and Na2+ -K+ -Cl- -SO 42- type water. Hill (1940) has developed a pattern diagram and later improved by Piper (1944, 1953) to form of trilinear diagram, which is an effective tool in segregating analysis data with respect to sources of the dissolved constituents in groundwater.\n\nMultivariate statistical techniques such as factor analysis and cluster analysis were applied to identify the major factors (variables) corresponding to the different source of variation in groundwater quality of Baghdad. Factor analysis identified three major factors explaining 82.506% of the total variance in water quality; and the major variations are related to degree of mineralization of the geological components of soils, irrigation return flow, agricultural activities and mixing of wastewater. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three different groups of similarities between the sampling sites, reflecting different physicochemical properties and pollution levels in the groundwater quality.\n\nFrom: Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part (A),No.2, 2015.\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part (A),No.2, 2015.\n\n\nThree latent factors were identified as responsible for the data structure, explaining 82.506% of total variance in the data set. The first factor explained 59.627% of the total variance and mainly related to mineralization and irrigation return flow. The second factor explained 11.569% which represents the agricultural activities from agricultural areas such as fertilization and mixing of wastewater whereas, the third factor explained 11.309% of the variances and reflects the acidity–alkalinity scale in groundwater.\n\n\n\nFrom: Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part (A),No.2, 2015.\n\n\nSOIL\t\nIn 1965, the Iraq government formed the State Board for Land Reclamation, which was charged with mapping the soils or Iraq. To date this governmental entity drafted an exploratory map of the entire country.\n\nThe soil classification revealed the following soil types in Iraq: Aridisol (~45%), Entisol (~20%), Inceptisol (~15%), Vertisol (~10%), Alfisol (~5%), and Mollisol (~5%). Soils formed near the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers are dominated by relatively fertile alluvial soils within the Entisol soil order, while those in the south and western deserts are barren and marginal rangeland soils within the Aridisol soil order. Soils in the northern Zagros Mountain Range receive up to ten times the annual precipitation as those of the southwestern regions, and as a result, soils of the Mollisol, Alfisol, and Vertisol soil order can be found in the northern foothills up to the Iraqi- Iranian border.\n\n\nExploratory map of the soils of Iraq\n\n\n\nThe Quaternary period (including Pleistocene and Holocene ages) affected the formation and nature of soil in Iraq. During this period, many processes took place that caused some erosion in the mountains and hills. Terraces have been formed along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and their tributaries as a result of changing climate. Rivers and wind filled up the Mesopotamian plain with fine texture sediments. Moreover, secondary gypsum crest has been formed and covered large areas of the deserts and the Mesopotamian plain. Almost all the soil of center and southern parts of Iraq became saline due to the natural conditions and the shallow level of ground water. Due to repeated flooding and irrigation practices, layers of mud accumulated on the original soil. As a result, most of the basin areas of the rivers are of silty soil. Quaternary sediments are covering nearly 30% of the Iraqi surface area as it can be noticed on the geological map (Figure below). They are important for the human activities and engineering works\n\n\nGeological map of Iraq\nFrom.: Sissakian, V.K. (2000) Geological Map of Iraq. 3rd Edition, State Company of Geological Survey and Mining, Baghdad.\n\n\nBaghdad is located in the central part of the country in the middle Mesopotamian plain (Figure above). The area is covered by accumulation of the deposits brought by the two rivers (Tigris and Euphrates). The area was occupied by humans since the dawn of civilization. Early human activities affected the soil formations because they were depending mainly on agriculture, irrigation and farm practices. These activities made numerous changes in the soil characteristics from one place to another. Over the years, soil became a sequential stratum from alluvial and sand sediment. The changing course of the river caused changes in the flood plain of the river\n\n\n\nand thus changing the sequences of the deposited layers. These changes gave the soil at Baghdad unexpected and misleading characteristics. Moreover, the soil is saline because of the arid climate. Based on the nature of Baghdad, soils are mostly of fluvial origin (clayey and silty) with some gypsiferous soil, and sand.\n\nGypseous soils are one of the most complex materials that challange the geotechnical engineers. In Iraq it has been reported that several structures have experienced different patterns of cracks and uneven deformations generated primearly from the exposion of the supporting gypseous soils to water. It is a well known fact that gypseous soils demonstrate high bearing capacity and very low compressibility when they are in the dry state. On the contrary a sudden collapsibile behaviour was reported when the gypseous soils are exposed to water.The collapsibility of gypseous soils results from the direct contact of water. The dissolution of different types of salts contained inside the mass of gypseous soil will generate new pores inside the soil skeleton and loosen the cementing bonds between the particles. This process creates a meta stable structure that facilitates the sliding of particles into a more dense state. The rate of dissolution of gypsum depends primarily on environmental changes in moisture content generating from fluctuation of ground water table and /or surface water, climate changes typically temperature, permeability and state of flow conditions in addition to the type and content of gypsum. (Ref. Challenging Problems of Gypseous Soils in Iraq, Al-Saoudi N.K.S., Al-Khafaji A.N., Al-Mosawi M.J., 2013). (FAO 1990), although more recent study (Ismail 1994) reported that gypseous soils cover 31.7 % of the total area of Iraq. The first map demonstrating the distribution of gypsum in Iraq was presented by (Buringh 1960) indicating five zones as shown in next figure.\n\n\nFirst map of distribution of gypsum in Iraq\nFrom.: Al- Saoudi N.K.S., Al- Khafaji A.N., Al- Mosawi M.J. (2013), , V.K. (2000) Challenging Problems of Gypseous Soils in Iraq.\n\n\n\nThe primary gypsum is located in the extreme north area between tigres and euphraties rivers. The second zone where primary gypsum mixed with limstone located below and parrallel to the euphraties river extending from the west desert to the south. The secondary gypsum is identified in two areas, one in the north below the first zone and one in the south – west. The fourth zone is gypsiferous alluvium extens from the north in a narrow band and gradually widened towards the south. The fifth zone representing the non gypsiferous soil, mainly limestone is identified in two ares one in the north east and the other in the west desert.\n\nA more refined map exhibiting the distribution of gypsum in Iraq was presented by Al-Barrazanji (Gypsiferous soils in Iraq., 1973). He investigated thoroughyl the type and gypsum content in different parts of Iraq and proposed the map shown in next figure. Six zones are distiguished according to their origin and gypsum content.\n\n\nDistribution of gypsum in Iraq (Al Barazanji 1973)\nFrom.: Al- Saoudi N.K.S., Al- Khafaji A.N., Al- Mosawi M.J.

Abbas - Mapping Land Cover/Land Use for Change Derivation Using Remote Sensing and GIS Technique\n\n\n\nLand use / Land cover data will become an analytic tool that allows to ask questions about the relationship between these features and, as they refer to real-world coordinate systems, to other masterplan maps, representing conditions on the ground.\n\nAll the data will be georeferenced by means of QGIS, an open source, Geographic Information System (GIS) software to do analysis.\n\nBaghdad is part of a geological formation called the Mesopotamian Plain Region so its sediments are recent not exceeding Quaternary ages. The land is considered highly flat with no clear natural drainage pattern. Baghdad has a Calcaric Fluvisols soil type with about 20% of lime. Most soils of Baghdad area are therefore secondary soils (residual soils) derived from the above regions, transported from place of weathering and accumulated as a result of sedimentation. Besides, Baghdad soil strata are affected by river course changes during previous decades leading to coarse silt deposits and giving different depositional stratigraphy each few meters, thus Baghdad strata are erratic, somewhat are nonhomogeneous with a water table near ground. This soil in generally is alkaline with poor permeability (NCCL, 1986; Karim and Schanz, 2006). Organic matter content is low and the carbon nitrogen ration is narrow.\n\nThe main stratigraphic units of Baghdad soil are: landfill layer consists of cohesive and non-cohesive materials; the upper natural sub-soil strata consists mainly clay or brown silty clay or clayey silt sometimes with sand or a little amount of gravel; while the lower layer is the natural soil strata consists of medium dense to very dense brown to grey sand mixed with gravel or lenses of clay or silty clay (NCCL, 1986; Karim and Schanz, 2006). The depositional conditions of Baghdad area during geological times, such as and human activities, affect the nature of Baghdad soil and its groundwater quality. Baghdad soil is characterized by its high salinity due to dryness, rainfall scarcity and evaporation leading to groundwater upward movement and causing fluctuation of groundwater levels in the area.\n\nExcerpt of Geological map of Iraq, scale 1:1000000 4th Edition, 2012 From: Iraqi Bulletin of Geology and Mining Heritage, Vol.11, No.1, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: M. Al-Saffar - Baghdad; City of Cultural Heritage and Monumental Islamic Architecture\n\n\nFrom: Baghdad Comprehensive City Development Plan 2030 http://www.unit44.net/practice/ecological-planning/project-57bb6afbd6acd0-59570009\n\n\nBIODIVERSITY\t\nThere are four vegetation zones in Iraq: the desert, the steppe, the mountain forest, and the Alpine regions. The formation of the short-lived herbaceous plants in the mountain forest and the alpine regions is due to the low rainfall rates. Desert and steppe regions lacks any arboreal types. The northern region of Iraq is mountainous with relatively high rainfall rates, thus it sustains virgin forests, man-made forests, and a large number of crop plants and their wild relatives. Zagros Mountains suffer from over cutting and overgrazing, which consequently caused a reduction in some of Iraq’s oak forests to scrublands. Higher elevations include alpine plants that can survive harsh weather. It is evident that biodiversity in Iraq is under increasing threat of ecosystem destruction due to overgrazing and mismanagement of rangelands. The major ecological concern in the northern highlands and mountains is deforestation. The northern regions in Iraq are supports a wide range of stone fruit trees, both wild and domesticated. Central and southern Iraq is known for the evergreen fruit trees, including date palm. Figure below demonstrates the distribution of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\nKey Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) of Iraq\n\n\nIMPACTS ASSESMENT AND PROPOSED MITIGATION MEASURES\t\n\nODOR\t\nDuring WWTP operation, generation of some level of hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S) will create odors especially at the initial pumping station, the screening, the sand removal, the primary sedimentation, the thickener and the areas of the plant in which sludge handling allows its contact with the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, the design should optimize the configuration so as to minimize the conditions that cover generation of bad odors. As a mitigation measure, the proposed design adopted bio filtration technology to minimize odors generation.\n\nREUSE ISSUES\t\nThe quality of the treated effluent will be suitable for irrigation. However, there are number of issues that should be considered. First, the effluent should be tested at discharge point to ensure E.coli limits of 100 MPN of total E.coli form in 100 ml of water. In addition, irrigation methods should comply with WHO instruction whereby sprinkler irrigation is not permitted. Moreover, crop types and harvesting periods should be determined to avoid public health hazards. On the other hand, public perception of reuse should also be taken into consideration. Public opposition to effluent reuse in irrigation can be mitigated by public awareness on the risks and benefits of reclaimed water reuse.\n\nAs regarding the disposal of the final stabilized sludge that comes out from the WWTP, it is intended to be safely discharged in authorized landfills and there is no potential for reutilization.\n\nVECTOR BREEDING\t\nAnaerobic tanks can attract aquatic insects such as mosquitoes, which are known vectors of malaria and encephalitis. However, the decreased number of cesspits and elimination of wastewater flowing in open channels will decrease the vector breeding habitats within the served areas.\n\nIf necessary, insecticide should be used to control vector breeding in the area surrounding the treatment plant.\n\nSLUDGE  HANDLING\t\nThe produced sludge will be stabilized to avoid odor generation. In addition, sludge will be adequately dehydrated to facilitate transportation to the disposal landfill.\n\nHowever, proper handling of sludge should be emphasised. Such practices may include marking the transporting vehicles with a clear font. In addition to preventing any leakage of liquids from vehicles or dispersion of sludge from the surface by covering the whole load so that no treated sludge can find its way out of the vehicle.\n\n\nPROTECTION OF WATER RESOURCES\t\nThe proposed project will reduce the possibility of groundwater contamination due to percolation from individual tanks. However, the groundwater contamination from wastewater in treatment tanks can be avoided by lining of the tanks.\n\nOn the other hand, discharge of the treated effluent to a river is not expected to pose public health hazard. This is because the effluent will be disinfected before discharge.\n\nINDUSTRIAL DISCHARGE\t\nAccording to the wastewater analysis, the influent is mainly due to domestic wastewater and there are no records of toxic/inhibitors compounds that come from industrial discharge. However, for future purpose, the potential discharge of industrial wastewater in the Al-Khansaa WWTP upstream shall be continuously monitored and prevented. The most threatening impact coming from industrial discharge is that it is full of inhibitor compounds that may affect the pH of the water and the biological activity, this can ultimately cause the failure of the biological treatment processes. High concentrations of these toxic and inhibitor compounds, such as heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers and chemical compounds, are of great concern because of their persistence and non-degradability. Therefore, it is recommended, as a mitigation measure, to monitor that in the future Industrial plants will not discharge upstream of the Al-Khansaa WWTP. In the case that this scenario cannot be avoided, it should be mandatory that every industrial plant has to be provided of its own localized wastewater treatment unit.\n\nEMPLOYMENT AND DEVELOPMENT\t\nDuring construction, the local economy and working population are expected to benefit from the proposed project which will generate direct and indirect temporary employment opportunities. During operation of the WWTP a number of permanent job opportunities will be available for technical positions as well as for labours. However, to increase the effect of this positive impact, priority in hiring should be given to qualified locals.\n\nOCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH\t\nDuring operation of the new facility, workers involved in the daily functions of the plant will be exposed to hazards such as contact with the wastewater during maintenance works.\n\nProtective gear such as masks, gloves, long boots and protective suits should be provided to workers when undertaking repair activities or any activity that poses biohazards. Separate protective gears should be assigned to each worker and sharing should be limited to avoid transmission of diseases. The gears should be inspected for contamination or loss of integrity (holes, cracks, etc.) prior to use. Workers should be trained on safe removal techniques for contaminated protective gears and other clothing.\n\n\n\nIn addition, safety training for all staff members should be required to minimize injuries within the facility. Workers should be familiar with the location of the first aid station or kit, each fire alarm and each fire extinguisher.\n",

Including things like:\n\nIraq faces a real water crisis”, warned the President of the Republic of Iraq, H.E. Abdul Latif Rashid at the UN Water Conference, who recalled that over the last 40 years water flows from the Euphrates and Tigris, which provide up to 98% of Iraq’s surface water, have decreased by 30 to 40%. \nThe Tigris and Euphrates Rivers Basins are the most important sources of surface water for some 237 million people across Iraq (43.5 million), Iran (88 million), Syria (21 million) and Türkiye (85 million). The rivers system, including their many tributaries, is essential to Iraq, and its riparian States. But competing needs of water for irrigation, drinking water supply (only some 60% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water services), industry, hydropower production and the environment, combined with diminishing water quantity and deteriorating water quality, pose difficult management challenges. These challenges are exacerbated by the impacts of climate change.",

It is committed to environmental sustainability and legal compliance.\nEnvironmental, Social & Financial Impact\nUntreated wastewater can have serious effects on the environment to the extent high levels of Contaminated water cannot be reused, If the wastewater is dumped into lakes or rivers means we are using up dwindling supplies of natural water resources.\nThis process of dumping wastewater into the natural water supply can pose hazards not only to human health, but can also have a devastating effect on wildlife, especially for fish and other small creatures which live in water. Harmful substances in water can also get into fields and soil, which results in smaller crop yields for farmers. \nThe damage to ecosystems due to excessive wastewater discharges has impacts beyond the environment. Economic impacts, such as pumping waste water into Dijlah river, will cause losses to the population since river banks normally are invested for tourism, commercial and employment opportunities. \nIn the economic analysis of this investment, the ecological externalities of the project were monetized, starting from the assumption that the wastewater treatment process is a process that has desired output—treated water—but also undesirable outputs, such as suspended particles, etc. Their estimated value, determined by “shadow prices”, actually represents the avoided damage/costs, i.e., the realized benefit/income for the environment as a result of the removal of pollutants during treatment in the WWTP. \nThe difference between the pollution costs for wastewater and the pollution costs for treated water represents the realized savings in the cost of pollution, i.e., environmental benefits. For example, the suspended particles. The final results of the conducted economic cost-benefit analysis unequivocally indicate the full socio-economic justification for the investment. At the same time, the sensitivity analysis proved that the project is resistant to possible changes in input parameters over time.\nProblem Statement and Environmental Existing Condition\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Introduction\n\nIraqi Environmental Protection and Enhancement Law No. 27 for 2009. The project is categorized as a Category B Environmental Assessment by the World Bank, signifying specific and localized environmental impacts.\nProject Area Description \n[[The facility is situated near Medical City, an area characterized by its urban development and significant wastewater discharge, impacting the Tigris River. The Al Zuyut Plant aims to mitigate these effects.]]\nLegislative Framework\nThe project adheres to the Iraqi Environmental Protection Law and other relevant legislations, ensuring comprehensive environmental compliance in areas like water resources, occupational health, and international treaties.\nEnvironmental Baseline and Climate\n\n[[The environmental baseline includes a detailed analysis of the climate, water resources, soil, and biodiversity, considering the specific conditions of the Baghdad region and the impact of Medical City's activities.]]\nImpact Assessment and Mitigation Measures \n[[The report details the impacts of the project, especially in relation to Medical City's wastewater, and proposes mitigation measures. These include advanced treatment processes to address contaminants and reduce pollution levels in the Tigris River.]]\nCommitment to Environmental and Legal Compliance \n[[The project demonstrates a strong commitment to environmental protection and adherence to legal requirements, ensuring sustainable development and minimal negative impact on the environment.]]\n",

      "content": "Improving the quality of the Environmental Impact Report involves a strategic approach to writing, research, and content integration. Here are five creative ideas to enhance the writing quality:\n\n1. **Thematic Structuring**: Organize each section around a specific theme or aspect of the project. For instance, the \"Current Environmental Status\" section could be themed around \"Water Quality and Urban Impact,\" focusing on how the project will improve these areas.\n\n2. **Narrative Storytelling**: Incorporate a narrative element to make the report more engaging. For example, start the \"Challenges Identification\" section with a brief narrative illustrating the real-world impact of water pollution in Baghdad.\n\n3. **Visual Data Integration**: Use infographics, charts, or maps to visually represent key data from the CSV file and PDFs. This makes complex information more accessible and understandable.\n\n4. **Stakeholder Quotes and Perspectives**: Include quotes from local community members, environmental experts, or government officials in Iraq to provide diverse perspectives and emphasize the project's broader impact.\n\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: In sections like \"Technology Overview,\" compare the proposed technology with current practices to highlight its advantages. Use data and insights from the PDFs to support these comparisons.\n\nFor Section 2, \"Current Environmental Status,\" I recommend first summarizing relevant content from the \"Monthly accumulative wastewater\" and \"Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River\" documents to ensure the information is fresh and accurate. Then, we can structure the section to align with our thematic approach, incorporating visual elements and comparative analysis to enhance the presentation of the data.

These documents contain crucial data on water quality and the impact of untreated wastewater on the environment and society.\n2. **CSV Data Integration**: Relevant data from \"consolidated_water_treatment_data.csv\" will be used to provide statistical backing for the impacts discussed.\n3. **Content Focus**: This section will highlight the adverse effects of untreated wastewater on the environment, society, and economy. It will cover the impact on natural water resources, health risks, and economic implications like loss in tourism and agriculture.\n\n**Writing Section 2 - Environmental, Social, and Financial Impact**:\n\n---\n\n\"Untreated wastewater in the Medical City area poses significant environmental, social, and financial challenges. Analysis from 'Monthly accumulative wastewater' and 'Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River' reveals alarming levels of water contamination. High concentrations of pollutants render the water unfit for reuse, leading to a depletion of natural water resources. This contamination not only poses serious health hazards to the local population but also severely impacts aquatic life and ecosystems.\n\nThe social implications are profound, with communities facing increased health risks due to contaminated water sources. The financial impact is equally concerning. As detailed in the reports, the discharge of wastewater into the Dijlah River adversely affects industries reliant on clean water, including tourism and agriculture. This results in significant economic losses, diminishing the livelihoods of local communities.\n\nAn economic analysis within these documents monetizes the ecological externalities of the project. By treating wastewater, we not only produce clean water but also reduce pollutants like suspended particles. The savings in pollution costs and the benefits to the environment from pollutant removal are substantial. The economic cost-benefit analysis conducted clearly indicates the socio-economic justification for the investment in the wastewater treatment plant. Additionally, sensitivity analysis demonstrates the project's resilience to potential changes over time.\n\nIn conclusion, the untreated wastewater situation in Medical City demands urgent action. The proposed wastewater treatment plant not only addresses the immediate environmental and health concerns but also presents a financially viable solution with long-term benefits for the community and the environment.\"\n\n---\n\nNext, we will move on to Section 3, focusing on the \"Problem Statement and Environmental Existing Condition\".

Here's the improved section:\n\n---\n\n**Section 4: Current Environmental Status**\n\nThe health of the Tigris River, a critical waterway for Baghdad, is facing significant environmental challenges. A systematic analysis of water quality indicators has identified that contaminants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates have reached alarming levels, often exceeding the safety thresholds set for environmental and public health.\n\nRecent data has shown an upward trend in these pollutants, suggesting an urgent need for effective wastewater management strategies. Notably, the elevated BOD and suspended solids reflect a high degree of organic pollution, implying that the river’s capacity to support aquatic life is compromised.\n\n*Suggested Data Visualization: A line graph here could effectively display the trend of these pollutants over the recent months, providing a clear visual representation of the escalating situation.*\n\nMoreover, the performance of existing wastewater treatment operations has been suboptimal, with treated effluent still showing considerable levels of impurities. This indicates the need for advanced treatment solutions to address the inefficiencies in the current system.\n\n*Suggested Data Visualization: A bar chart could be placed here to contrast the quality of effluent before and after treatment, highlighting the gap that the new wastewater treatment technologies aim to fill.*\n\nThis environmental assessment underscores the need for immediate intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of pollution on the Tigris River. The situation is a stark reminder of the broader water management issues that Iraq is grappling with, necessitating infrastructural improvements and a renewed focus on sustainable water resource management.\n\nIn conclusion, the data points to a clear need for action. Enhancing the wastewater treatment framework is not just a local necessity but a vital step towards safeguarding Iraq’s water resources for the present and the future.\n\n---\n\nThis revised section communicates the urgency of the situation while avoiding alarmist tones, and it suggests data visualization to enhance understanding. It also aligns with the factual and informative approach typically adopted in environmental impact reports.",

Abdul Latif Rashid at the UN Water Conference. With a marked reduction in river flows, a deepening concern for Iraq's water resources emerges. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers, vital for the nation's water supply, have seen a significant decrease in flow rates over the past four decades, intensifying the need for efficient water management.\n\nTransitioning to a local scale, the environmental status of the Tigris River adjacent to Medical City illustrates the tangible impacts of this broader crisis. Water quality data indicates that key contaminants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates are present at levels that warrant attention. These indicators not only reflect the health of the river but also inform the efficacy of current wastewater treatment protocols.\n\nIn light of global trends and local data, it becomes evident that strategic improvements in wastewater treatment are required. Enhanced treatment methods are essential to not only address the immediate concerns related to Medical City's outfall but also to contribute to the larger objective of mitigating Iraq's water scarcity challenges.\n\n*Data Visualization Recommendation*: Incorporating a line graph depicting the historical trends of river flow rates alongside the recent levels of BOD, suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates can provide a comprehensive view of the water quality dynamics.\n\nThis factual approach, supported by data visualization, seeks to inform stakeholders of the current environmental status without inducing undue alarm. It presents an opportunity to understand the scope of water-related issues in Iraq and the specific conditions at Medical City, guiding informed decision-making for future water management and treatment strategies.",

This report synthesizes data from various studies, including the impact of untreated wastewater on the Tigris River and regional health, and introduces an advanced treatment shaft technology designed to significantly enhance water quality. It evaluates the environmental implications of the current scenario, the efficacy of the proposed technology, and its compliance with Iraqi environmental laws, including law Law No 27 of 2009 for Protection and Improvement of Environment.. The report underscores the necessity of this project in mitigating water pollution, safeguarding public health, and contributing to Iraq's sustainable development.\nIntroduction\nIraq's struggle with water management, particularly in urban areas like Baghdad's Medical City, necessitates an innovative approach to wastewater treatment. The Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project, with a capacity of 150,000 m3/day, is conceived to address these challenges. This report outlines the project’s objectives, detailing the deployment of cutting-edge treatment shaft technology to improve water quality and meet environmental sustainability goals. Emphasizing legal compliance and socio-economic benefits, the report provides an introduction to the current environmental standards, the legislative framework the project will adhere to, the treatment methodology and its expected impact.\nEnvironmental, Social & Financial Impact\nUntreated wastewater can have serious effects on the environment to the extent high levels of Contaminated water cannot be reused, If the wastewater is dumped into lakes or rivers means we are using up dwindling supplies of natural water resources.\nThis process of dumping wastewater into the natural water supply can pose hazards not only to human health, but can also have a devastating effect on wildlife, especially for fish and other small creatures which live in water. Harmful substances in water can also get into fields and soil, which results in smaller crop yields for farmers. \nThe damage to ecosystems due to excessive wastewater discharges has impacts beyond the environment. Economic impacts, such as pumping waste water into Dijlah river, will cause losses to the population since river banks normally are invested for tourism, commercial and employment opportunities. \nIn the economic analysis of this investment, the ecological externalities of the project were monetized, starting from the assumption that the wastewater treatment process is a process that has desired output—treated water—but also undesirable outputs, such as suspended particles, etc. Their estimated value, determined by “shadow prices”, actually represents the avoided damage/costs, i.e., the realized benefit/income for the environment as a result of the removal of pollutants during treatment in the WWTP. \nThe difference between the pollution costs for wastewater and the pollution costs for treated water represents the realized savings in the cost of pollution, i.e., environmental benefits. For example, the suspended particles. The final results of the conducted economic cost-benefit analysis unequivocally indicate the full socio-economic justification for the investment. At the same time, the sensitivity analysis proved that the project is resistant to possible changes in input parameters over time.\nCurrent Environmental Status\nThe water crisis in Iraq sets a critical backdrop for environmental discussions, as highlighted by H.E. Abdul Latif Rashid at the UN Water Conference referencing that over the last 40 years water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris have decreased by 30 to 40%. With a marked reduction in river flows pollution concerns at the Medical City site become more and more important to address.\nThe aggregated contaminated water from Medical City is seen exiting this sewer into the Tigris river in the image below:  \nThis pollution is visible on land, as well as from satellite imagery, indicating the severity of the contamination of the river:\n \nThe environmental status of Medical City outfall has been well researched by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain. Water quality data indicates that key contaminants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates are present at levels that surpass legal levels set by Iraqi Laws, such as Law No 27 of 2009 for Protection and Improvement of Environment.\n\nNote: S2 is site two, near Medical City\nReference: Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the medical city on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq Abdullah M. Ahmed*, Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani DOI: 10.22124/CJES.2024.7447\n\nThe mean value of COD is higher than that of permissible limit of Iraqi river standards.\n\n\n\nReference: Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on WaterQuality of Tigris River  https://doi.org/10.30684/etj.34.3B.8 \nIn light of global trends and local data, it becomes evident that strategic improvements in wastewater treatment are required. Enhanced treatment methods are essential to not only address the immediate concerns related to Medical City's outfall but also to contribute to the larger objective of mitigating Iraq's water challenges.\nTechnology Overview\nThe award winning treatment shaft technology is proposed for the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant. It represents a significant advancement in wastewater treatment methodologies. \nWET has two technologies for wastewater treatment that provide two levels of treatment, these are:\n\nTreatment Shaft (TS) technology for primary treatment that provide skimming, settling, screening and disinfection for most of the pollutant for safe discharge to surface water (Figure 1).\nDual Treatment Shaft (DTS) technology for providing (in addition to primary treatment) secondary and treasury treatment for municipal wastewater and for effluent water reuse for restricted irrigation (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFigure 1 – Treatment Shaft\t\t    Figure 2 - Double Treatment Shaft\t\n\nIt’s an innovative and patented design featuring a vertical Treatment Shaft achieves wastewater treatment objectives at a substantially less area for construction, lower cost than traditional alternatives, while controlling odor and simplifying operations.   The Treatment Shaft technology has been proven to treat wastewater discharges and eliminate pollution impact on water resources.  \n\nThis award winning technology involves a comprehensive process that includes pre-treatment, primary and secondary treatment phases, and a final disinfection stage. Each phase is designed to efficiently reduce specific pollutants. Modeling the improvements in water markers for the Medical City site we are confident we can meet, and exceed the WHO and Iraqi legal standards for water discharge quality. See the attached calculation sheet for the full model and calculations of the influent, effluent water markers, flow rates, and sludge production, and water quality estimates. \n\n\nThe Treatment Shaft - A Tested System\nThree major projects have been completed and have been in operation for many years in Michigan, USA.  One more project has been designed by ARCADIS Consultant for the city of New Jersey.  The following provides pictures for the three completed projects and ARCADIS design project.  A letter from NTH is attached indicating that these projects have met the State of Michigan Environmental Protection Agency discharge requirements after five years of operation monitoring requested by the State. \n\n\n\n\nLegal Compliance\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project is set within a robust legal framework that reflects Iraq's long-standing and evolving commitment to environmental stewardship. This includes adherence to historical legislations like Regulation No. (25) of 1967, which underscores Iraq's early initiatives in preserving its water resources. Additionally, Iraq's recent accession to the UN Water Convention, highlighting its dedication to transboundary water cooperation, sets a contemporary context for our project.\nOur project prioritizes legal compliance throughout its design and operational phases. We ensure that all aspects of wastewater treatment, from pollutant removal to effluent discharge, adhere to the mandated environmental standards. This commitment extends to regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms, ensuring ongoing compliance and adaptation to any legal updates.\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project aligns with Iraq's key environmental laws, especially Law No. 27 of 2009. This project not only improves water quality and public health but also follows Iraq's tradition of environmental protection. By using modern technology and practices, it sets an important example of responsible and legal environmental management. It reflects Iraq's ongoing commitment to both its environmental heritage and current goals for sustainable and excellent environmental practices.\nSignificance of the Project:\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project not only addresses contemporary environmental challenges but also resonates with Iraq's historical commitment to environmental legislation. Iraq's early initiatives, like the Regulation No. (25) of 1967, laid the foundation for protecting water resources, a commitment further solidified by joining the UN Water Convention.

      "content": "Reviewing the document, I find it contains solid content but can benefit from the following stylistic and structural improvements:\n\n1. **Abstract**: The abstract is well-crafted, but it could be more concise. The repetition of \"environmental laws\" and mentioning \"Law No 27\" twice can be avoided.\n\n2. **Introduction**: The introduction should directly segue into the specifics of the project's technology and expected outcomes rather than reiterating the environmental issues which would be covered in detail later.\n\n3. **Environmental, Social & Financial Impact**: This section has valuable information but is slightly repetitive about the effects of untreated wastewater. It could be more succinct and structured to flow better.\n\n4. **Current Environmental Status**: The transition from the global crisis to local issues is a bit abrupt. Integrating the global context with local data more seamlessly would improve flow.\n\n5. **Technology Overview**: This section could be improved by directly introducing the technology before mentioning awards and providing specific data to support claims of efficiency and compliance.\n\n6. **Legal Compliance**: This section is informative, but the transition between historical and contemporary legal frameworks is a bit disjointed. A smoother narrative that connects Iraq's historical dedication to its current legal obligations would enhance readability.\n\n7. **Significance of the Project**: The significance is well-argued but could do with a stronger closing statement that ties the project's benefits to Iraq's broader environmental and socio-economic context.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The conclusion is comprehensive but could be more impactful with a succinct summary and a strong final statement that reinforces the project's significance.\n\nHere are suggested improvements:\n\n**Abstract** (Revision):\nThis report examines the water management challenges in Baghdad's Medical City and introduces the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant's advanced treatment shaft technology.
