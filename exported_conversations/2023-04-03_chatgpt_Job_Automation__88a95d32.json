Here is a table that summarizes the categories of answers and their corresponding statements:\n\n| Category | Answer |\n| --- | --- |\n| Reflection on work | What about work? |\n| Connection between work and job | What does this have to do with my job? |\n| Statement about AI | No more jobs :P |\n| Importance of learning | We can know by example what will be the best solution, and we have to learn to ask the right questions |\n| Impact of technology on tasks | It means that mundane tasks that have been done 1000000x no longer need to be done |\n| Relationship between technology and jobs | Changes how we do our tasks, but not necessarily replaces us? |\n| General statement | Becomes a partner for thinking |\n\nI hope this helps clarify the content of the text!",
