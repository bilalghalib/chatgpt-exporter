      "content": "Perfect! Calla lilies can thrive outdoors with the right conditions. Here's how to plant and care for your **outdoor calla lily**:\n\n---\n\n### 🌿 Outdoor Planting Guide for Calla Lilies\n\n#### 1. **Choose the Right Spot**\n- **Sunlight**: \n  - In cooler climates: **Full sun** is ideal.\n  - In hotter regions (like southern France or Iraq): **Partial shade** in the afternoon is better to avoid leaf burn.\n- **Soil**: \n  - Rich, **well-draining** soil is crucial.\n  - You can mix in compost or well-rotted manure to enrich it.\n\n#### 2. **Planting Instructions**\n- **Timing**: \n  - Best to plant after the **last frost**, when the soil is warm (mid-spring to early summer).\n- **Depth**: \n  - Plant **5–10 cm (2–4 inches) deep**, with the rhizomes (bulb-like bases) facing up.\n- **Spacing**: \n  - Allow **30 cm (12 inches)** between plants to give them space to grow.\n\n#### 3. **Watering**\n- **Keep soil moist**, especially in the growing and blooming season.\n- Do **not let the soil dry out**, but avoid waterlogging. A **mulch layer** can help retain moisture.\n\n#### 4. **Feeding**\n- Use a **balanced liquid fertilizer** every 2–3 weeks during active growth (spring to midsummer).\n\n#### 5. **Seasonal Care**\n- **In colder areas (below 10°C/50°F in winter)**:\n  - After leaves yellow and die back in fall, **dig up the rhizomes**, let them dry, and store in a cool, dry place over winter.\n- **In warmer climates**:\n  - You can leave them in the ground year-round.\n\n---\n\nLet me know your location or climate zone if you want more specific planting timing and overwintering guidance!",

      "content": "Thanks! Since you're in **Lille, France** (Zone 8b–9a), here's a tailored guide for planting your **Calla Lily (Zantedeschia)** outdoors:\n\n---\n\n### 🌱 Planting Your Calla Lily in Lille (Temperate Climate)\n\n#### 📍 Climate Notes:\n- Winters in Lille can **dip below freezing (often -1°C to -5°C)**.\n- Calla lilies **aren’t frost-hardy** — so they **can’t stay in the ground over winter without protection**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ What to Do\n\n#### 1. **Where to Plant**\n- Choose a **sunny to part-shaded spot** — ideal: morning sun, afternoon shade.\n- Soil should be **rich, loose, and well-draining**. Mix in compost if it’s clay-heavy.\n\n#### 2. **When to Plant**\n- **Mid to late May** is ideal — after all risk of frost is gone and the soil is warming.\n- If you're planting the potted plant directly: harden it off by gradually introducing it to outdoor conditions over 3–5 days.\n\n#### 3. **How to Plant**\n- **Dig a hole** a little larger than the pot, loosen the soil, and plant **at the same depth** as it was in the pot.\n- Space other callas at least **30 cm** apart.\n- Water deeply after planting.\n\n#### 4. **Summer Care**\n- Water regularly — **keep soil moist** (not soggy).\n- Fertilize every **2–3 weeks** with a balanced flower fertilizer.\n- Remove spent flowers to encourage new blooms.\n\n#### 5. **Autumn & Winter**\n- Around **October**, once the leaves start to yellow:\n  - **Cut the leaves down** to about 10 cm.\n  - Carefully **dig up the rhizomes** (the fat root-like base), rinse off soil.\n  - Let them **dry for a few days**, then store in **peat moss, dry compost, or sawdust** in a **cool, dark, frost-free place** (around 10°C).\n  - Replant next spring!\n\n> ✅ **Alternative**: If you prefer low effort, keep the plant **in a large pot** sunk into the ground for the summer. Then in fall, just lift the whole pot and store it indoors.\n\n---\n\nWould you like help writing a garden tag for it or tracking it in a seasonal planting calendar?",
