I wanted to also take this and turn it into a sort of, Application or I can use something very simple to create a way for people to log in create anonymous accounts to somehow give information to help pro profile themselves according to the different kinds of random acts of kindness. And I'm wondering maybe we should we should first actually take the steps to figure out how to profile, the kinds of actions that people can take so that we can then identify which ones they'll be most likely to do, and then from there, we can then, offer them some suggestions. And so like, it would also, it would be kinda good to know, like, what are the opportunities they have for it. So do they are they living close to their parents? Are they married? Do they have children? Like, what are their relationships? And do they live in a city? Do are they in a rural place? Are they creative? Can they draw? Do they like saying? Like, what do they have that could be considered a gift? Maybe gifts that they don't even know are gifts that they actually have that are gifts how can I think about this systematically so that we can come up with a good way to profile and give people the opportunity to do a random act of kindness that would make them really excited and feel proud of themselves and help them come alive?EditThis is a fantastic direction for evolving Kindness Kiwi into a more personalized application! Creating a systematic profiling approach will help match people with kindness acts that truly resonate with them. Let me outline a structured framework for this:\nA Systematic Approach to Kindness Profiling\n1. Core Dimensions for Kindness Profiling\nWe can think of kindness opportunities along several key dimensions:\nA. Personal Context & Resources\n\nRelational Context\n\nFamily proximity (parents, siblings, extended family)\nPartnership status (single, partnered, married)\nParental status (children, their ages)\nSocial circles (close friends, acquaintances, community involvement)\n\n\nEnvironmental Context\n\nLiving situation (urban, suburban, rural)\nMobility (car access, public transit, walking distance to community)\nWorkspace (office, remote, mixed)\nCommunity resources (parks, libraries, community centers)\n\n\nTime & Energy Resources\n\nAvailable time pockets (15 minutes, 1 hour, half day, etc.)\nEnergy patterns (morning person, night owl)\nScheduling flexibility\nSpontaneity comfort level\n\n\n\nB. Personal Gifts & Strengths\n\nCreative Abilities\n\nVisual arts (drawing, painting, photography)\nWriting (poetry, stories, letters)\nMusic (singing, playing instruments)\nCrafting (sewing, knitting, woodworking)\n\n\nInterpersonal Strengths\n\nListening skills\nConversational abilities\nEmpathic presence\nTeaching/mentoring capacity\n\n\nPractical Skills\n\nCooking/baking\nGardening/plant care\nTechnology assistance\nRepair/building abilities\nOrganization skills\n\n\n\nC. Value & Motivation Dimensions\n\nPreferred Impact Style\n\nDirect vs. anonymous giving\nOne-to-one vs. community-oriented\nImmediate vs. sustained impact\nPractical vs. emotional/spiritual support\n\n\nPersonal Growth Edges\n\nComfort with vulnerability\nDesire to expand social connections\nInterest in new skills development\nCourage to try new interactions\n\n\nValue Orientation\n\nEnvironmental consciousness\nSocial justice awareness\nCultural preservation\nSpiritual/mindfulness practice\n\n\n\n2. Profiling Implementation Approach\nTo create a practical application, we could implement this as:\n\nProgressive Questionnaire\n\nBegin with a short, engaging questionnaire (5-7 questions)\nAllow users to \"unlock\" additional profiling for more personalized suggestions\nUse friendly, conversational language\n\n\nExample Questions\n\n\"When you have 15 free minutes, you're most likely to...\" (reveals time use preferences)\n\"Complete this sentence: People often tell me I'm good at...\" (reveals hidden gifts)\n\"Which would make you smile more: A) A heartfelt thank you note, B) Seeing someone use something you created, C) Knowing you made someone's day easier\" (reveals value orientation)\n\n\nVisual Elements\n\nInstead of a clinical survey, use visual choice cards\nProgress visualization (growing kiwi plant as profile develops)\nCategories represented by friendly icons\n\n\n\n3. Kindness Act Matching System\nOnce profiled, the system could categorize kindness acts by:\n\nEffort Level\n\nQuick (5-15 minutes)\nMedium (30-60 minutes)\nDeeper (multi-hour or ongoing)\n\n\nContext Categories\n\nHome-based\nNeighborhood/community\nWorkplace/school\nOnline/digital\nNature/outdoor\n\n\nGift Utilization\n\nCreating (using artistic/making skills)\nSupporting (using interpersonal skills)\nSharing knowledge (using expertise)\nPhysical help (using practical skills)\n\n\nSurprise Factor\n\nDirect (expected kindness)\nUnexpected (surprise kindness)\nAnonymous (mystery kindness)\n\n\n\n4. Technical Implementation Options (MVP)\nFor a simple starter implementation:\n\nNo-Code/Low-Code Options\n\nTypeform + Airtable (for questionnaire and response categorization)\nBubble.io (for more interactive experience)\nGlide (to create a simple app from a spreadsheet)\n\n\nAuthentication\n\nUse anonymous IDs (similar to Reddit's approach)\nAllow optional email signup for progress tracking\nCould use \"magic links\" instead of passwords\n\n\nProfile Storage\n\nKeep profiles locally in browser storage for simplest implementation\nProvide option to save profile for returning users\nUse unique URL sharing for anonymous profiles\n\n\n\n5. Practical Next Steps\n\nCreate a condensed \"kindness profile\" questionnaire with 10-15 key questions\nCategorize 30-50 kindness acts by the dimensions above\nBuild a simple matching algorithm (even in spreadsheet form)\nTest with a small group to refine the matching quality\nImplement as a simple web tool connected to your existing site\n\nWould you like me to develop any specific piece of this framework further? I could:\n\nCreate the actual profiling questionnaire\nDevelop a taxonomy of kindness acts categorized by these dimensions\nDesign a simple algorithm for matching profiles to acts\nOutline specific technical implementation details for your preferred platform\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that it discovers not just what kindness acts would resonate with someone, but actually helps people discover gifts they might not even recognize in themselves - creating a double layer of positive self-discovery.RetryBGOkay. So, is there any research for random acts of kindness that we can leverage for this profile or what are some adjacent ideas that we can be leveraging And to, take advantage of other types of research. I wanna be a little more systematic and thoughtful about this. So, and also, I don't want to ask them, too many questions. So first, let's figure out what the, setup maybe. And then let's see if we can get a, Way to access that information in a straightforward way. For instance, I believe that if we were working directly with their LLM, we wouldn't have to do much at all because it would have enough context about them. Or if we got some information some other way. How about them? Yep. Thanks. What charities would you contribute to? Have you contributed to? Your favorite movies, like, Superhero favorite. More, like, VR. Something. You know, like, some of you got, what are other things like this where we can deduce a lot of information And that would help, like, profile demo.EditYou're absolutely right about being more systematic and using efficient profiling methods that don't overwhelm users. The key is to leverage existing research while finding clever proxy questions that reveal multiple dimensions of a person's preferences and values.\nResearch on Random Acts of Kindness\nSeveral research areas can inform our profiling approach:\n\nProsocial Behavior Research\n\nStudies by Lyubomirsky and Layous (2013) show that kindness activities boost well-being most when they:\n\nFit with the person's interests/values\nVary in type (preventing hedonic adaptation)\nInclude seeing the impact\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Five Love Languages\" Framework\n\nWhile originally for relationships, this well-known framework (Chapman) categorizes how people prefer to give and receive:\n\nWords of affirmation\nActs of service\nReceiving gifts\nQuality time\nPhysical touch\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Strengths Research (VIA Institute)\n\nThe 24 character strengths identified can predict kindness preferences\nPeople are more likely to engage in kindness acts that leverage their top strengths\n\n\nPersonality Research\n\nEven simplified personality dimensions (extraversion/introversion, etc.) correlate with kindness preferences\nExtraverts often prefer direct, interpersonal acts; introverts may prefer behind-the-scenes kindness\n\n\n\nProxy Questions and Stealth Assessment\nInstead of direct profiling, we can use clever proxy questions that reveal multiple dimensions:\n1. Media Preferences as Proxy Data\nExample Questions:\n\n\"What's the last movie/show that made you feel good?\" (reveals value orientation)\n\"Choose a fictional character you relate to\" (reveals personality traits)\n\nResearch Basis: Media psychology research shows strong correlations between preferences and personality traits (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003)\n2. Behavioral Choices\nExample Questions:\n\n\"You have an unexpected free afternoon. You most likely would...\" (reveals introversion/extraversion, creativity preferences)\n\"When you last gave a gift you were proud of, what made it special?\" (reveals love language and effort preferences)\n\nResearch Basis: Behavioral economics shows hypothetical choices reliably predict actual behavior patterns\n3. Reaction-Based Assessment\nExample Questions:\n\n\"Which of these headlines would make you stop scrolling?\" (reveals cause orientation)\n\"Which of these images feels most calming to you?\" (reveals aesthetic and environmental preferences)\n\nResearch Basis: Implicit association tests show quick reactions reveal underlying values\n4. LLM-Based Opportunity\nAs you mentioned, LLMs offer a unique opportunity. If users have access to ChatGPT or similar, we could:\n\nCreate a prompt that asks the LLM to analyze the user's chat history and provide:\n\nInferred personality traits\nDetected interests and values\nPotential kindness matches\n\n\nThen have users paste this simplified profile into our system\n\nExample prompt: \"Based on my conversation history, what types of random acts of kindness might align with my personality, interests, and values? Please provide a brief profile of my apparent strengths and preferences, and then suggest 3-5 kindness acts that would feel authentic to me.\"\nMinimalist Profiling Framework\nFor an MVP, we could use just 5-7 high-value questions:\n\n\"Which cause would you be most likely to volunteer for?\" (reveals value orientation)\n\nAnimal welfare\nChildren's education\nElder support\nEnvironmental protection\nCommunity arts\nCrisis support\n\n\n\"Which of these would make you feel most appreciated?\" (reveals reciprocity preference)\n\nA heartfelt note\nSomeone doing a task for you\nQuality time together\nA thoughtful gift\nPhysical support or assistance\n\n\n\"Which of these activities would you most enjoy doing on a weekend?\" (reveals personality and skill domains)\n\nCreating something with your hands\nExploring nature or a new place\nDeep conversations with friends\nLearning something new\nOrganizing or improving a space\n\n\n\"You notice someone having a hard day. Your first instinct would be to...\" (reveals kindness style)\n\nOffer a listening ear\nGive them space but check in later\nDo something practical to help\nShare an uplifting story or joke\nGive them a small gift or treat\n\n\n\"Which statement feels most true for you right now?\" (reveals growth edge)\n\n\"I'd like to feel more connected to my community\"\n\"I want to use my skills and talents more meaningfully\"\n\"I want to be more spontaneous and break routine\"\n\"I want to deepen my existing relationships\"\n\"I want to create more beauty or order in the world\"\n\n\n\nTechnical Implementation Ideas\nFor a lightweight but effective implementation:\n\nFirebase + Simple Web App\n\nAnonymous auth is built-in\nFree tier would handle an MVP easily\nCan store user preferences and match to curated kindness acts\n\n\nLLM-Enhanced Web Tool\n\nUser answers minimal questions\nCombined with a standardized LLM prompt for those who want deeper personalization\nBlend of manual and AI-driven matching\n\n\nProgressive Web App\n\nWorks offline\nCan send gentle reminders about kindness opportunities\nAllows for anonymous \"kindness journaling\"\n\n\n\nWould you like me to develop any of these specific approaches further? For instance, I could:\n\nCreate a complete set of the minimal profile questions with scoring guide\nDevelop a framework for categorizing kindness acts by these dimensions\nDesign a simple algorithm that shows how the matching would work\nCreate a technical specification for implementation\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that it feels like a fun exploration rather than a clinical assessment, while still gathering powerful predictive data."
