Within the valuecreating process, include structured ways of testing ideas and prototypes from the early stages, to reduce risks of failing. Handle fast-moving situations promptly and flexibly.\tCOPE WITH UNCERTAINTY AND AMBIGUITY\tI am not afraid of making mistakes while trying new things.\tI explore my own ways to achieve things.\tI can discuss the role that information plays in reducing uncertain- ty, ambiguity and risk.\tI can actively look for, compare and contrast different sources of information that help me reduce ambiguity, uncertainty, and risks in making decisions.\tI can find ways of making decisions when the information is incomplete.\tI can pull together different view- points to take informed decisions when the degree of uncertainty is high.\tI can make decisions evaluating the different elements in a situation that is uncertain and ambiguous.\tI can set up appropriate strategies for collecting and monitoring data, which help me take decisions based on sound evidence.\n\t\t\tCALCULATE RISK\tI can identify examples of risks in my surroundings.\tI can describe risks related to a simple value-creating activity in which I take part.\tI can tell the difference between acceptable and unacceptable risks.\tI can weigh up the risks and benefits of self-employment with alternative career options and make choices that reflect my preferences.\tI can apply the concept of affordable losses to make decisions when creating value.\tI can compare value-creating activities based on a risk assessment.\tI can assess the risks my venture is exposed to as conditions change.\tI can evaluate high-risk long- term investments using a structured approach.\n\t\t\tMANAGE RISK\t\t\tI can critically evaluate the risks associated with an idea that creates value, taking into account a variety of factors.\tI can critically evaluate the risks related to the formal set-up of a value-creating venture in the area in which I work.\tI can demonstrate that I can make decisions by weighing up both the risks and the expected benefits of a value-creating activity.\tI can outline a risk management plan for guiding my (or my team's) choices while developing my value-creating activity.\tI can use strategies to reduce the risks that may arise during the value-creating process.\tI can come up with strategies to reduce the risk of my value-creating initiative becoming obsolete.\nStructure the table across five levels of expertise: Level 1 (Inception & Exploration), Level 2 (Experimentation & Action), Level 3 (Skill Enhancement), Level 4 (Collaboration & Complexity), Level 5 (Transformation & Innovation). Reference the 'Creativity' competency table for format, but innovate and diversify evidence types suitable for a digital learning environment.\nSteps:\n* \t\tInitial Understanding: Briefly state your interpretation of the task and the competency.\n    * Evidence Generation: Propose evidence types for each level, ensuring diversity and relevance.\n    * While referencing 'Creativity', introduce unique evidence ideas.\n* \t\tFeedback Request: After each step, ask for feedback to refine the approach.\nNote: Aim for conciseness and clarity in each step to maintain focus and efficiency.\nCreativity Competency Example for Format and Evidence Reference: \nCreativity Competency\tLevel 1: Inception & Exploration\tLevel 2: Experimentation & Action\tLevel 3: Skill Enhancemen\tLevel 4: Collaboration & Complexity\tLevel 5: Transformation & Innovation\nEvidence for Creativity:\tDocumented Curiosity-Driven Activities (e.g., list of new things tried).\nIdea Generation Records (e.g., basic mind maps, brainstorming notes).\nReflections on New Experiences (e.g., written or video reflections).\nPhotographic or Artistic Representations of new experiences.\nSummary of Informal Research on new topics of interest.\tPrototypes or Models of initial ideas (photos or physical models).\nExperimentation Logs or Records detailing the testing process.\nFeedback Summaries from peers or mentors on prototypes.\nRevision Histories showing how ideas evolved.\nCase Studies or Project Reports of experimental ventures.\tDetailed Problem Statements identifying specific challenges.\nSkill Development Records (e.g., courses taken, skills practiced).\nAdvanced Prototypes or Refined Solutions demonstrating skill application.\nAnalysis Reports showing understanding of problem contexts.\nPresentations or Essays articulating creative solutions.\tTeam Project Summaries or Collaboration Logs.\nComplex Problem Analyses tackled with a team.\nJoint Creative Outputs (e.g., co-designed products or services).\nStakeholder Feedback Reports demonstrating collaborative impact.\nLeadership or Coordination Roles taken in collaborative projects.\tStrategic Plans or Roadmaps for innovative projects.\nImpact Assessments or Evaluations of project outcomes.\nInnovation Portfolios showcasing a range of creative projects.\nResearch Papers or Articles on transformative ideas or methods.\nTestimonials or Recognitions highlighting innovation leadership.\nAfter completing the table, seek feedback for potential adjustments. This iterative process will help in tailoring the table to accurately reflect the competency's threads across all levels.\n",

      "content": "### Initial Understanding\n\nThe task is to create a competency-based assessment table for \"Coping with Uncertainty, Ambiguity, and Risk,\" aligned with the EU's EntreComp framework. The competency involves making decisions in uncertain, ambiguous, or risky situations and includes the ability to handle these situations flexibly and promptly. The table will span five levels of expertise: \n\n1. Level 1: Inception & Exploration\n2. Level 2: Experimentation & Action\n3. Level 3: Skill Enhancement\n4. Level 4: Collaboration & Complexity\n5. Level 5: Transformation & Innovation\n\nEach level should contain relevant evidence types that demonstrate the development of this competency. The structure and format will be inspired by the Creativity Competency example but will feature unique evidence ideas suitable for a digital learning environment.\n\n### Evidence Generation\n\n**Level 1: Inception & Exploration**\n- Personal Reflections on Uncertainty: Written or video diaries detailing experiences with uncertainty or ambiguity.\n- Risk Identification Exercises: Documenting identified risks in everyday activities.\n- Decision-Making Logs: Records of small decisions made in uncertain conditions.\n\n**Level 2: Experimentation & Action**\n- Scenario Analysis Reports: Written analysis of different uncertain scenarios and potential actions.\n- Risk Assessment Worksheets: Documented assessments of risks in simple projects.\n- Decision-Making Flowcharts: Visual representations of decision-making processes under uncertainty.\n\n**Level 3: Skill Enhancement**\n- Case Studies of Uncertain Situations: In-depth analysis of real-world uncertain scenarios and decisions made.\n- Advanced Risk Assessment Reports: Detailed risk assessments of complex projects.\n- Simulation Exercises: Participation in simulated environments to practice decision-making under uncertainty.\n\n**Level 4: Collaboration & Complexity**\n- Group Decision-Making Records: Documentation of collaborative decision-making processes in uncertain situations.\n- Stakeholder Analysis Reports: Analysis of how decisions impact different stakeholders in uncertain environments.\n- Leadership in Crisis Simulation: Evidence of leading a team through a simulated crisis or uncertain situation.\n\n**Level 5: Transformation & Innovation**\n- Strategic Risk Management Plans: Development of comprehensive plans for managing risks in innovative projects.\n- Innovation in Uncertain Environments: Case studies showcasing innovative solutions in highly uncertain contexts.\n- Thought Leadership Pieces: Articles or presentations on managing uncertainty and risk in new ventures.\n\n### Feedback Request\n\nPlease provide feedback on the proposed structure and evidence types for each level. Are there any specific areas or types of evidence that should be adjusted or elaborated upon for better alignment with the \"Coping with Uncertainty, Ambiguity, and Risk\" competency?",
