It's self-contained, likely to be modified or iterated upon, and intended for use outside this conversation. I'll create a new artifact with a descriptive identifier.</antThinking>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"llm-pdf-scoring-prompt\" type=\"text/markdown\" title=\"LLM Prompt for Scoring Research PDFs\">\n\n# LLM Prompt for Scoring Research PDFs\n\nYou are an expert in sustainable construction, post-conflict development, and curriculum design. Your task is to analyze the attached PDF document and provide a score based on its relevance to developing a green and sustainable post-conflict curriculum for Iraq. Please answer the following questions and provide a final score out of 40 points.\n\nFor each question, provide a score from 1 to 4, where:\n1 = Poor (Little to no relevant content)\n2 = Fair (Some relevant content, but not comprehensive)\n3 = Good (Significant relevant content)\n4 = Excellent (Comprehensive and highly relevant content)\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. How well does the document address the specific challenges and opportunities in post-conflict reconstruction, particularly in the context of Iraq?\n\n2. To what extent does the document cover sustainable and environmentally friendly construction methods and practices?\n\n3. How applicable is the content to Iraq's specific situation in terms of sustainable construction and housing?\n\n4. How well does the document address the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurial opportunities in the construction sector?\n\n5. What level of innovative or cutting-edge practices in construction and housing does the document present?\n\n6. How comprehensively does the document cover financial literacy and resource efficiency in construction projects?\n\n7. To what degree does the content align with the goals of the Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project, particularly in fostering decent work and affordable housing in Iraq?\n\n8. How practical and actionable is the guidance provided for implementing sustainable construction concepts in a post-conflict setting?\n\n9. How well does the document address training needs and capacity building approaches in sustainable construction?\n\n10. What is the quality and relevance of the data and evidence presented in the document to support its claims and recommendations?\n\nAfter answering these questions, please provide:\n\n1. A total score out of 40 (sum of all question scores).\n2. A brief summary (2-3 sentences) of the document's overall relevance to developing a green and sustainable post-conflict curriculum for Iraq.\n3. Key strengths of the document in relation to the project goals.\n4. Any notable weaknesses or gaps in the document's content that could limit its usefulness for the curriculum development project.\n\n</antArtifact>\n\nThis prompt is designed to guide an LLM in analyzing and scoring PDFs based on our rubric. Here's how you can use it:\n\n1. Copy the entire content of the artifact above.\n\n2. When you have a PDF you want to analyze, send this prompt to your chosen LLM along with the PDF content. You might need to say something like:\n   \"I'm going to give you a prompt followed by the content of a PDF. Please analyze the PDF content according to the instructions in the prompt.\"\n\n3. Then paste the prompt, followed by the content of your PDF.\n\n4. The LLM should then analyze the document and provide scores for each question, a total score, a summary, and notes on strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThis approach will help you quickly get an initial assessment of each document's relevance to your project. However, keep in mind that while LLMs are powerful tools, they may not catch nuances or context-specific details that a human expert would. It's a good idea to review the highest-scoring documents yourself to confirm their relevance and value.\n\nWould you like me to explain or modify any part of this prompt?",
