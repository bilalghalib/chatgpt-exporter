Terms of Reference: Expert for Curriculum Development\n1.1 Background\nThe International Trade Centre (ITC) is a joint agency of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, focusing in particular on developing the export capabilities of small and medium-sized businesses in developing and transition economies. ITC is 100% \"Aid for Trade\", supporting trade that delivers inclusive and sustainable development results. ITC’s mandate covers all developing countries and transition economies with special emphasis on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs) Fragile States and Sub-Saharan Africa. To support a more inclusive distribution of development gains, ITC works with women, youth, and marginalized groups in developing countries to empower them through entrepreneurship and skills that provide gateways to jobs and enterprise creation.\n\nThe Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq, implemented by UN-Habitat, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the International Trade Centre (ITC), aims to foster decent work and affordable housing. This multi-faceted initiative encompasses integrating employment-intensive investment and local resource-based approaches into Iraq's National Public Works Programme, enhancing capacity for sustainable and affordable housing, promoting trade-led private sector engagement in climate-smart construction, and empowering social partners for better labour market outcomes. Through these components, BEIT focuses on gender and sustainable financing, developing sustainable financial tools and legislative frameworks, forming SME cluster alliances, and fostering social dialogue and capacity building among social partners, all to address housing challenges, create jobs, and support SMEs while mitigating climate change impacts in the housing sector.\n\nOutput 3.3 of the project is designed to enhance the capabilities of local businesses, particularly focusing on young entrepreneurs, to incorporate green and innovative practices into their operations. This includes a comprehensive approach to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the development of sustainable and innovative capabilities, especially in sectors like climate-smart solutions and innovative construction technology.\n\nThe project plans to:\nReinforce Business Development Services: Strengthening the portfolio of service providers to offer training, coaching, and mentoring in areas critical for sustainable and innovative business practices.\nLeverage Peer Learning: Facilitating learning from institutional and company-level peers to help entrepreneurs effectively understand and implement sustainable practices.\nEnhance TVET Alignment: Aligning Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs with the needs of businesses to ensure practical and industry-relevant training.\nCultivate Partnerships: Establishing collaborations with multinational corporations, training institutions and other industry stakeholders for knowledge transfer and skill development.\nImplement Targeted Activities:\n3.3.1: Designing and implementing modular training for professionals on sustainable construction, repairs, resource efficiency, and financial literacy.\n3.3.2: Developing partnerships with construction material suppliers, universities, and innovators to mainstream climate-smart solutions.\n3.3.3: Establishing pilot training sites and model houses showcasing affordable green techniques in collaboration with UN-Habitat.\n3.3.4: Strengthening the capacities of organizations supporting MSMEs, with a focus on services in entrepreneurship and financial literacy.\n3.3.5: Creating a certified trainee system, a resource repository, regular networking events, and associated marketing efforts in collaboration with local alliances. \n\nThis strategic focus on building capacities, fostering partnerships, and aligning educational programs with market needs aims to empower young entrepreneurs and small businesses to contribute to economic empowerment and job creation through sustainable and innovative practices.\n\n1.2 Description of Duties/Responsibilities\nIn Q4 2024, a competency-based curriculum aimed at enhancing the skills of young people and women in sustainable construction has been developed.

This program is run by a UN group that wants to help people get good jobs, build better homes, and protect the environment at the same time.\n\nThe curriculum (training program) has already been started, but now they need an expert to:\n- Make sure it's actually useful and understandable to the people it's for\n- Add helpful tools and videos so teachers can use them again and again\n- Train local teachers to run the workshops themselves\n- Help businesses offer internships or hands-on experiences to students\n\nThere are deadlines:\n- First, they want to talk to local people and improve the plan by **May**.\n- Then, they want the full curriculum and trainer materials ready by **July**.\n- Finally, by **September**, they want the local trainers trained and a plan in place to keep everything going after the expert leaves.\n\nIt's like setting up a great class, teaching the teachers, giving them all the tools they need, and making sure the learning continues even after the expert is gone.\n\nLet me know if you want a one-page version for printing or sharing!",
