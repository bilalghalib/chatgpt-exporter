Prioritize sending the email and creating the Google Doc as \"easy wins.\"\n2. Use errands and physical tasks to recharge and reset energy.\n3. Dedicate focused time to the book project, ensuring progress aligns with broader values.\n4. Reflect on the system prompt as a living document, adaptable to evolving insights.\n\n---\n\n### System Note\nThis export captures the user’s overarching themes, task flows, and attentional policies. It integrates reflections on energy rhythms, tensions between CAPs and IAPs, and the alignment of practical and meaningful tasks. This context can guide future sessions and project iterations.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Additional Missing Context:\n\n########################################################################\n# 8.

And then create more moments like that in a new way in the next\n\n\nLet me pull this critical insight thread:\nYour 80% rapid mastery serves multiple functions:\n\nPower move (\"you're not special\")\nProtection from deep commitment\nPerpetual novelty maintaining dopamine\nShield against genuine awe\nThe spiritual apprenticeship parallel you raised is fascinating - let's look at today's opportunity matrix:\n\n\nUntitled\nClick to open diagram\n3 Sharp Questions for Today (Not Week):\n\nWhat if today's sourdough became a practice in the final 20% - not just making bread but really seeing your relationship with completion?\nInstead of using ADD as context, what if we used your spiritual understanding of apprenticeship to frame today's choices?\nCan you bring the same presence you have in risky physical moments (longboarding) to one moment of being seen today?\nSystem Note - \"That's Interesting\" Markers:\nI notice you light up around:\n\nSpiritual-practical connections\nPhysical risk parallels\nSystem pattern recognition This suggests our system should include explicit bridges between physical courage and emotional courage, using your natural pattern recognition as the bridge.\nYour relationship with expertise is complex - you can quickly reach 80% to prove \"anyone can do it,\" but that same skill could be redirected toward genuine appreciation of both your gifts and others' mastery.\n\nToday's Small Brave Thing:\nInstead of picking a week-long commitment, what if we took today's sourdough as a practice in presence and completion? Not just making bread, but really being with the process, documenting it, sharing it - bringing the same focus you bring to longboarding to this one creation.\n\nWant to explore how to make this one small thing both meaningful and manageable?\n\n Copy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nYeah. What Why do I want the shield against genuine odd? That doesn't really make sense. Yeah. I wonder. Like, being seen by who? Who matters besides my wife? Oh, no. The baby's awake. It's too early. Okay. Now I wanna pray, but I only have 5 minutes before this hour. It all needs to be opened. So how about I bring one thing? Back. How do I do that with this hour though? And can you help me use ADD? Spiritual understanding of apprenticeship? Maybe I need more together\n\n\nI hear the immediate tension - prayer, sourdough timing, and baby waking early. Let's focus just on this next hour with spiritual attention.\n\nFor this hour's practice:\nPresent Elements:\n\nSourdough needs opening\nPrayer calling\nBaby awake early\nTime pressure rising\nWhat if we used your parallel processing as a spiritual practice right now?\nThe Sufi tradition often speaks of finding sacred presence in ordinary moments. Your ADD might actually be a gift here:\n\nImmediate Practice Suggestion:\n\nOpen oven WITH presence (30 seconds)\nMake this one motion a prayer\nFeel the heat as divine presence\nLet time pressure be part of the practice\nQuick Prayer Frame (2-3 minutes)\nUse the baby's early waking as the call\nLet bread timing structure the prayer\nAccept interruption as part of practice\n3 Questions (Just for this hour):\n\nWhat if your ADD's time-blindness became time-presence just for this one opening of the oven?\nCould this morning's \"too many things\" actually be the perfect spiritual practice?\nWhat if being \"seen\" right now is just about being present with bread, baby, and prayer - nothing more?\nSystem Note:\nI notice how anxiety rises when multiple sacred things compete (prayer time, bread timing, baby care). Your parallel processing might actually be a form of spiritual practice - holding multiple sacred moments simultaneously. Instead of fighting it, what if this hour became a practice in sacred juggling?\n\nWant to try this reframe for just the next 60 minutes?\n\n Copy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nOkay. So I'm taking oven, and I'm gonna open it And I'm gonna try to be present and intentional. I'm making the spread I love my family Android want them to, Have good meal. And I'm going to start making, breakfast. Instead of another prayer. Going to read some Quran while the thing heats up. And, y'all make some eggs for my wife With intentionality. And you don't Okay. Drugs help me be that way. Intentional presence What are they doing to my brain? That I could do with other methods. Some meditation, know, I used to meditate for, like, an hour a day for 3 months straight. And I've been on and off meditating, but, like, I don't wanna be those non blinker guys. I like my energy and my therapist and psychiatrist tried to give me mood stabilizers. She said it might help with my ADD. But I don't wanna be like that. I like my high energy. People like my high energy. Appreciate it. It's the one that's taking me around the world. It's giving me my jobs. I'm fun. I'm funny. People appreciate my presence. Even if I doubt it. So I don't wanna be intentional. And be able to focus and dig deep And maybe I am digging deep. Look how I'm digging deep with this prompt and this idea. I had this idea that today, the thing that I would do to Make it a craft. It's right by hand. All of the different parts of the System. Either coaching in person, which I think is better for me than just making a system prompt and giving it to Maybe I shouldn't tell people I'm making a a system prompt. Maybe the system prompt should just help me help people. And just have them talk to me, and I send it to the machine, and I get those insights, and then I talk back 2 then. Rather than it being complete. And I can say I'm, like, an AI enhanced coach or something. But, that's the process. And here we go. Bismillah.\n\n\nWow - this reflection captures something profound about presence, energy, and authenticity.\n\nYour morning presence practice is already revealing something crucial: There's a difference between \"being intentional\" and \"being less you.\" Look at what's happening:\n\nRight Now:\n\nMaking bread with love for family\nReading Quran while things heat\nPreparing eggs with care\nThinking deeply about systems All while maintaining your energy and essence\nThis IS presence. It's just not linear presence.\n\n3 Reflections:\n\nYour \"high energy\" isn't opposed to depth - you're literally demonstrating deep insight while making breakfast\nThe coaching insight is powerful - being an intermediary rather than trying to create a \"complete\" system\nYou're already practicing intentionality, just not in the \"non-blinker\" way\n3 Questions:\n\nWhat if your coaching style could honor both your energy AND your ability to see patterns?\nHow might \"AI enhanced coach\" allow you to be more you rather than less?\nWhat if the system's role is to augment your natural gifts rather than replace your style?\nSystem Note:\nI see something beautiful emerging - you're not choosing between high energy and depth, you're finding ways to let your natural energy carry depth. \"Bismillah\" while making eggs isn't less spiritual than silent meditation; it might actually be more authentic to your path.\n\nWant to explore how this morning's practice might inform your coaching approach?"

I have a tension, i want to sleep, i want to work on this, i need to ship packages because people bought stuff and my assistant is waiting for me to send them to mark them as shipped, haha, and my wife leaves tomorrow and it is probably a good idea to sleep with her now to cuddle what's the right thing to do?",

This honors your CAP about spiritual principles while creating structure.\n\n2. \"Story Collection Practice\" - Instead of refining the prompt, spend a week collecting real coaching moments where humor revealed truth. These become your test cases, grounding theory in practice.\n\n3. \"Beauty-First Documentation\" - Start each work session by writing one beautiful insight about what you're building, before touching any code. This satisfies your drive for beauty while moving the work forward.\n\n4. \"Apprenticeship Mindset\" - Choose one person to be your first proper student/client with this system. Their real needs become your guide, preventing endless refinement.\n\n5. \"Physical Anchoring\" - Tie your system work to physical acts (like making bread or packing orders) - when the physical task is done, the thinking session is done. This uses your natural gift for finding meaning in practical acts.\n\nWould you like to explore which of these ten approaches (yours and mine) feels most aligned with who you want to become, rather than just what you want to perfect?",
