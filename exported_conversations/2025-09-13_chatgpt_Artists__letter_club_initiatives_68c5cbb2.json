      "content": "Here’s a summary of “artists’ letter club” / “mail art / correspondence art” initiatives: what they are, how they’ve worked, and some notable projects. If you had a specific club in mind, I can dig into that more deeply.  \n\n---\n\n## What is “Artists’ Letter Club” / Mail Art\n\n- **Mail art / correspondence art** is a movement/practice where artists send small-scale artworks (postcards, collages, letters, artistamps, objects) through the postal system. citeturn1search10turn1search2turn1search1  \n- Its roots go back to things like Ray Johnson’s *New York Correspondence School* in the 1950s‐60s, and the Fluxus movement, which embraced formally loose, playful, networked exchange. citeturn1search10turn1search11  \n- Key features include: low cost, democratized participation, personal / poetic content, informal networks, often unjuried or experimental, minimal gatekeeping. citeturn1search10turn1search2turn1search1  \n\n---\n\n## How Some Initiatives Have Worked\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n| Initiative / Name | Organizer / Location / Time | Mechanics / Structure | Purpose or Character |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Brain Cell (Ryosuke Cohen)** | Started 1985, global contributors citeturn1search20 | Artists send small images, stamps, etc. Cohen compiles them into a “cell” print; many copies are made; contributors receive a print + documentation. citeturn1search20 | To build networked art, exchange; connect artists globally; create a continuous evolving work. |\n| **USPS Art Project (“Artists for the USPS”)** | Started by Christina Massey around 2020, USA citeturn1search1turn1search9turn1search3 | Artists sign up, pair up, send unfinished works via mail; partner completes, send back; works are shared, exhibited. Open call‐based, inclusive, multi‐medium. citeturn1search1turn1search16turn1search3 | To support the postal system; maintain artist community during COVID lockdowns; to connect people, inspire collaboration. |\n| **Mail Art Club (Creativity Explored, San Francisco)** | Ongoing, especially during pandemic (2020-22) citeturn0search2turn1search0 | Artists exchange handmade postcards, blank books, use self‐addressed envelopes; weekly or periodic meetings (including virtual); later exhibited. citeturn0search2turn1search0 | To maintain connection and creative practice during isolation; inclusive of artists with varying access to tech. |\n| **MIT / List Center Postcard Art Exchange (“Works in Progress”)** | MIT / USA during COVID closures citeturn1search13 | Participants create postcards, mail to others, exchange; content tied to experiences during pandemic; then document online. citeturn1search13 | To keep communities connected; to offer creative outlet during remote / lockdown periods; to slow down and reflect. |\n| **Artpool / Fluxus / Early Correspondence Networks** | 1960s-80s, many countries, Hungary via Artpool etc. citeturn1search23turn1search11turn1search2turn1search22 | Artists would exchange artistamps, send works, print newsletters, curate exhibitions of mailed work; organize projects like “Artpool’s Periodical Space.” citeturn1search23 | To bypass mainstream art institutions; foster international avant‐garde connections; experiment with form, medium, geography. |\n\n---\n\n## Some Names & Terms to Know\n\n- *Mail Art / Postal Art / Correspondence Art* – the broad movement. citeturn1search10  \n- Ray Johnson and the New York Correspondence School – early pioneers. citeturn1search10  \n- Fluxus – avant‐garde movement heavily involved in mail art networks. citeturn1search2turn1search11  \n- Artistamps (artists’ stamps) – miniature stamps created by artists, often used in mail art. citeturn1search10  \n- Active archives (Artpool etc.) – organizations that collect, document, facilitate, and generate correspondence art. citeturn1search23  \n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can try to find a specific “Artists Letter Club” (if that’s the name) or list more examples by country, or more recent ones. Do you want me to pull those together?",
