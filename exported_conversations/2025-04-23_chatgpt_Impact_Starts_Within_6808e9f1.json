To complement the **\"Grow inward, bloom outward\"** headline and add visual warmth and cohesion, here are a few ideas for what might fit well in the **empty space around the title and header area**—especially in the top or bottom margins:\n\n---\n\n### 🌱 **Option 1: Add a Graphic Element (Above or Below the Title)**\nUse a **simple vector graphic** like the one you requested earlier — a growing plant with roots or a blooming flower — placed:\n\n- **above the headline** (symbolizing growth leading into the title)  \n- or **below the title** to draw the eye downward into the content\n\nYou could even animate a tiny sprout to bloom slightly if this is digital.\n\n---\n\n### ✍️ **Option 2: A Complementary Subhead / Tagline**\nUnder the title “Grow inward, bloom outward,” you could add a softer, supporting line like:\n\n- *Explore inner growth for outer impact.*\n- *Rooted in self, rising for change.*\n- *Your mission starts within.*\n- *Inner skills for a changing world.*\n\n---\n\n### 🎨 **Option 3: Decorative Flourishes**\nConsider subtle **corner vines, curved lines, or radiating dots** that symbolically echo “blooming” or “growth.” These could frame the top or sides of the flyer and add visual movement without clutter.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to generate a new background with a plant vector **integrated into this poster layout**, or just provide assets you can place into Canva?",
