      "content": "The **European stag beetle** (*Lucanus cervus*) has different diets depending on its life stage:\n\n### 🐛 **Larval Stage (grubs):**\n- **Main diet:** **Decaying wood**\n- Specifically, they feed on **rotten hardwood** (like oak, beech, and ash), spending 3–7 years inside logs or underground tree roots.\n- They help recycle nutrients by breaking down dead wood.\n\n### 🪲 **Adult Stage:**\n- **Main diet:** **Tree sap and overripe fruit**\n- Adults don’t eat solid wood; instead, they:\n  - Sip **sap** oozing from damaged trees.\n  - Drink juices from **fallen or fermenting fruits** (like apples or plums).\n- They eat very little—most of their energy comes from the reserves built up during their larval stage.\n\nLet me know if you’re curious about habitat, mating behavior, or how to spot them!",

      "content": "If you've found an **adult European stag beetle** (*Lucanus cervus*) near Lyon and are wondering about feeding it sugar water:\n\n---\n\n## 🚫 Should You Offer Sugar Water?\n\n**No—avoid giving sugar water or honey water.**  \nFeeding such solutions can disrupt the beetle’s gut pH balance and may be unhealthy. Instead, adults are naturally adapted to sip tree sap and juices from overripe fruit—*not plain sugar solutions* citeturn0search0turn0search4.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Safe and Beneficial?\n\n### 🪲 Adult Beetles:\n- **Prefer sap runs** from damaged trees or overripe and soft wild fruits like cherries and plums. They rhythmically dip their feathery mouthparts into the juices to drink citeturn0search12turn0search11turn0search7.\n- If found near naturally fermenting fruit on the ground, offering a small piece of clean, soft fruit can be acceptable.\n- **Do not feed sugar-water mixtures** or acidic fruit juices; such foods may disturb their delicate digestive system citeturn0search0turn0search4.\n\n### 🐛 Larvae (grubs):\n- These live underground in **decaying hardwood** (e.g. oak, beech, ash), feeding on **white‑rot wood** for several years. They do *not* consume liquid food citeturn0search3turn0search5turn0search9.\n\n---\n\n## What Should You Do Instead?\n\n1. If the beetle is mobile and undamaged, gently **place it back near decaying logs or old trees**.\n2. If you wish to support it:\n   - Provide a **piece of clean, overripe fruit** (e.g. cherry or prune), free from mold.\n   - Offer it on a flat surface where the beetle can easily access the juice.\n3. Keep the beetle **in a humid, sheltered environment**, but do not confine it for prolonged periods.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Stage     | Safe Offering               | Not Recommended            |\n|-----------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Adult     | Overripe fruit, sap runs   | Plain sugar/honey water    |\n| Larva     | Decayed hardwood (in-situ) | Liquid food                |\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nAdults rely largely on nutrient reserves built up during the larval stage and only sip sugary fluids to fuel short-term activity (mostly mating). Improper feeding—especially sugar water—can upset their digestion and potentially harm them citeturn0search15turn0search11turn0search7turn0search0.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like to learn how to support stag beetles in gardens, build safe habitat or spot larvae safely!",
