Once I started deciding to make istikhara and choose I found myself moving towards wanting to be in relationship instead. (TBC)\n\nMarch 14, 2024\nLeave a comment\nIt pours forth\nUncategorized\nSo I’m on day four in Gambia and the inspiration keeps coming. I feel like inspiration is like food. You can’t go too long without having some or you’ll die.\n\nToday I’m reflecting on the idea that God will not test you with burdens you can’t handle. Most people interpret it as in you wont have too big a burden to carry and if God gives you a burden, it’s knowing that you have the capacity to manage it.\n\nNow when we shared this thought in our cirlce yesterday people raised concerns about the fact that some people have burdens and it breaks their backs, or even kills them. The insight I had through someone else here was that another way to look at it is that God wont hold you accountable for when you break under the burden.\n\nA few other things on my mind are about having cautiousness and God conciousness and the results of that in terms of being granted knowledge, openings from un expected places and more. And I must say, I’ve started testing this and it feels true. I realize for me faith feels like a bridge made of glass, you can take small and safe steps and not be too far above the ground yet feel vertigo and terror, you’re floating! Then you realize it’s glass and it’s fine you can walk. Then you get accustomed to the idea of faith because it has build credibility / validit and reliablility. Big words for an exhausted person. I’m going to sleep now ;D\n\nMarch 12, 2024\nLeave a comment\nI want to be free\nUncategorized\nIt’s the first day of Ramadan, the third day of being here in Gambia. And every day here I have found a bit of wisdom. I have decided to start sharing what I learn again. Blogging to help with thinking, rather than blogging to be something, to be reognized, or seen in a certain light. I feel repulsed by the idea of using ai to write blogs. I was discussing today with Dr Umar Faruq Abdullah  about the definition of “Kalam” in arabic, the word for to dialog or speak, is that kalam is not kalam unless it is beneficial, and it’s not kalam unless it has intent on behalf of the listener and the speaker. That was one of the treasures from today.\n\nYesterday’s treasure from Shaikh Ahmed I learned the Khuwaysa concept. that the Prophet (S) mentioned there will ome a time when people will become obsessed with their own thoughts and disprespectful towards knowledge and will also get lost in following their desires and whims. Which sounds pretty much like influencer/thought leadership culture. In those days he says to stay away from the public arenas and focus on the “khuwaysa” the private, few, intimate, close relationships. Which is where my mind has been going for a time, and I uess it’s one way to think of this blog, like honestly I don’t expect anyone to read this, it’s not in the “public arena” the place where people an tag and help share things, yet iI remember 2003 and my favorite days on the internet where I would write and read a few blogs, and I felt the person on the other side. I think thats what is different here. I mean even though with social media you can get full videos and total intimate settings it is minimized. Instead check out this blog from Doug, Open Thinkering. He is clearly a human being, someone out there thinking and sharing and thinking for themselves. \n\nI feel like the way to follow the prophetic commandment is to go back to open web standards, host your own server, host wordpress, contribute to knowledge in your own way.\n\nThe third bit of wisdom I have cleaned has to do with the verses on aggression in the quran, And that one might require more time to describe than I have now. I’m going to launch this no edits just to keep the ball rolling. Many hugs! salam\nBG\n\nMarch 11, 2024\nLeave a comment\nTruth, Exploration and Open Science\nUncategorized\nWhat is Open Science. What is science? How is it related to the truth of what is and ethics? Here’s a little bit of thought for you:\n\nOpen Science seems to be a return to fundamental principles of forces and possibility, and in the human domain – ethics. A mote of dust in the breeze knows precisely every force acting on it and thus dances in the light coming from an open window. For humanity, knowledge increases the range of possibilities and leads to new options of action. The truth of reality constrains all possibilities; this is vast, limited access to knowledge of fundamental truths of possibility constrains our available actions. Our ethical systems determine what of these possible actions to take. By expanding options, we can respond with more of our ethics intact – a proxy for a sort of wisdom.\nScience creates knowledge of the space of possibility of action. We derive this knowledge by taking an empirical view of the world or an experiment and concluding causation through a series of logical steps. This abbreviated version of the scientific method is cut off from the initiating force, the hypothesis. A hypothesis brings human motive to expand the realm of the true possibilities and may derive from self-satisfaction through closing gaps in knowledge or hypotheses that the hypothesizer believes will be “useful,” sometimes split into fundamental and applied sciences.\nAdding to the knowledge space of humanity, we create a more significant number of options for action in our reality bounded universe. Now that we know the relationship between matter and energy, we have the option to build nuclear reactors to solve the energy needs of humanity. Once we observed that putting seeds into the earth and watering them caused them to grow we were enabled the deductive observation of farming.\nOpen Science is the process where these hypotheses, observations as data, the process to derive them (by code or by convention) is easily accessible to others to replicate, review the methodology and conclusions. Open science brings the ethics of beauty into our world. Like observing the dance of thousands of dust motes in a beam of light, or a balanced ecosystem with all the forces at play bringing about an orchestra of action and reaction. Open Science can bring a faster and more accurate mapping of truth for anyone willing to participate. This expanded realm of possibility means we can act on our ethics with more dimensions of freedom. We may have kept the benefits of increased food production, energy production, highrises, antibiotics for the elite. It seems logical that experiments are being conducted today that only benefit the elite. Closed access / secret science goes against the desire of truth. What does truth desire? If we accept things are, and that truth is, then truth is truth and truth “desires” to be known, to fill its total shape as it does everywhere else. Consciousness (that which conducts science) seems to be a rare force in the universe in its ability to hide and lie. Open Science is not an ethic; it is an enabler of ethical actions through access to knowledge and options for behaviors.\nOpen Science puts consciousness into the service of beauty by theorizing, exploring, deducing, and sharing – creating space for ethics – creating space to dance.\n\nFebruary 2, 2020\nLeave a comment\nGlobal Protest Movements and Gandhi\nPersonal, philosophy\nA few weeks ago, in Paris, I nearly got caught up with The Extinction Rebellion protestors getting teargassed right outside my doorstep. The country my family is from, Iraq, has been having protests have been going for months now with over 500 people killed. Lebanon’s Martyrs square, while full of protesters, has thankfully seen fewer killed. The Extinction Rebellion grows louder. It’s been about 10 years since the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring. In 2003, I remember being 18 years old and speaking in front of 3,000 people against the Iraqi invasion. Growing up in a college town, protests and demonstrations were commonplace, yet I’m wary of jumping into the crowd these days, especially when the crowd is angry.\n\nEach of these movements has so much history and potential positive action, yet somehow I find myself unable to understand my responsibility towards them. Make your voice heard is the idea. As Desmond Tutu once said, “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”\n\n“We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. The opposite of love is not hate, itâ€™s indifference.”\nâ€” Elie Wiesel\n\nThere’s a word I’ve been struggling to identify. It describes a situation where the more effort you put into something, the more tangled up you become in it. That somehow, when you’re caught in barbed wire, it’s best to stop moving, rather than struggle further and deepen the burrs. Perhaps this is the excuse I give myself to not act, not support, not back, not chant, not take to the streets. This fog has only grown thicker as the protests movements have moved closer and closer to home.\n\nIn response, I’ve recently become obsessed with learning about Gandhi. I’ve known he was an inspiration to Martin Luther King Junior and Mandela, who both led movements shifted the path of history towards one of greater justice. Yet, I never depend on my relationship with his thinking first hand. It surprised me to see how he was initially so keen on serving the British empire, how duty-bound he felt to support them in their time of need. How strict he was with himself to do what he believed was true.\n\nThe movie Gandhi which came out in 1982, paints him in a picture where he seemed to act for goodness or to support India’s liberation movement. What inspires me is that he saw his entire endeavor as seeking the truth. It’s still resolving for me, yet I’m beginning to understand the threads he makes between truth-seeking, seeing the other as the self, and nonviolent noncooperation.\n\nGandhi’s first experiments in communal living started after reading Unto This Last by Ruskin. which is essentially an economic and political argument the crux of which is equal pay for all work and free schooling for all people. It led him to make some conclusions about self-sufficiency and to start building what later became known as his first ashram in South Africa. I’m finding that proto villages, eco makerspaces, earth ships, hacker farms, rural co-living spaces, spiritual permaculture hubs and other similar type spaces have been inspiring me more in these last years. Although considering them as a social alternative seems to lead to a strange future where educated, upper-middle-class and tech-savvy people flee cities to take the place of the rural people who just left the farms for a better 20th-century life. The continuation of that trend seems to pave the way to a dystopian survivalist version of the future with micro governments (mobs?) rule principalities.\n\nGandhi was nationalistic, and he believed in an India ruled by its population. The injustice of the British empire was apparent to him. What are the fundamental injustices behind so many of our modern-day protest movements? Growing financial inequality, corruption — which to me can be seen as related to inequality in that it’s a sort of jealousy described as a call towards fairness and potential ecological collapse. To my mind, these are caught in a quagmire. It’s a bit like an escalating feud. Power leads to economic and political gain at the expense of people and environment. Then in the process of removing the offensive force, people desire the same power and economic gains at the expense – yet again – of the natural world and quite possibly abusing another class of people.\n\nSeek not greater wealth, but simpler pleasure; not higher fortune, but deeper felicity.\n\n-Mahatma Gandhi\n\nGandhi had an interesting idea about the ethic of non-stealing. His perspective is that if you took any more than you needed for essential survival, you’re taking from someone else’s survival and hence qualified as theft and thus ate and owned very little. This sort of subsistence living may not be aspirational for many, and it may not need to be. There are smart people making arguments of abundance and wealth, for instance:\n\n“Wealth isnâ€™t about taking something from somebody elseâ€”itâ€™s about creating abundance for the world.”\n-Naval Ravikant\n\nImage result for the world has enough for everyone need but not everyone greed\n\n“TheÂ world has enough for everyone’s needs,Â but not everyone’s greed,”\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nIn different times of my life, I have dreamt of different dreams. One is of exploring the origins of reality and galaxies with a Dyson Sphere powering our class II civilization. The other is one where I realize how little I truly need to be happy, and enjoy life building paper microscopes with my hypothetical children.\n\nI am full of questions and doubts about what a beautiful way to live is, and I am open to living those questions as honestly as I can. What I loved about learning about Gandhi’s life is how commitments he made were like steps on a ladder. That a vow was solemn and that once he made it, you could trust it as much as you could trust a sturdy ladder leaning on a cliff face. That Gandhi’s exploration of metaphysical truth led to an in-world reality that others could rely on him for as much as they could rely on gravity.\n\nGandhi’s belief in Ahimsa – non-violence to any living thing – led him to a practice of humbling one’s self. It’s in this way he saw himself in all others.\nAhimsa is related to how Gandhi practiced non-violent non-cooperation, otherwise known as Satyagraha which is comprised of these principles:\n\nNonviolence (ahimsa)\nTruth â€” this includes honesty, but also means living fully for what is true, and agreeing with it\nNot stealing\nNon-possession or nor owning (not the same as being poor)\nBody-labor or bread-labor\nNot being afraid\nEqual respect for all religions\nFighting withÂ boycottsÂ (not spending or buying from those who are a problem)\nOthers as well, check the article above\nTo wrap up. Our systems are broken for the people and the planet. Protests movements are sprouting up requesting change at many levels and in many countries (I include the rise of the right wing and fascist political developments as a form of protest, asking to be heard). Questions about minimalism retreating and/or the possibility of abundance value creation for ever more people pop up. These ideas in turn disturb the desire for abnegation – although there may be a path related to value creation as a humble act of service and not an ego driven vehicle and/or expression of self into world.\n\nHere are some thoughts on protests and the future of some aspects of economics and politics. I would love to hear reflections.\n\nContinuing my hunt for my adventures in truth, I’m staying on the Gandhi reading list, next onto Tolstoy!\n\nWarmly,\nBilal\n\nJanuary 4, 2020\nLeave a comment\n",

I dreamt about the early web and how inspiring it was. It could have been a fluke that I hit puberty while web was still shiny? Or was there something really different about source code you could read/steal, finding a friend with a static IP address and hosting our own Movable Type instance. I still recall meeting people on IRC and waiting 30 mins to download a .wav file of some poorly played guitar music. The low quality staticy music of Smelly Cat made me feel like a modern day Alexander Bell. It was magical.\n\nI saved those files, I saved our chats. Our connection felt special and meaningful. Connecting from my basement room in Michigan to friends in New Zealand was like opening your eyes for the first time, grainy and low resolution, yet still in a strange way so much more real than what passes for connection on social media today.\n\nWhat’s changed? Speed, resolution, availability, mobile phones. This article claims that the 2010’s have broken our perception of time, in part due to the non-chronological newsfeed algorithms twitter and facebook rolled out. Perhaps.\n\nIn my life, I confess, I was sold on the rise of the self, the idea of the influencer, the personal brand. I was told careers are dead and that to be safe I had to be famous. The more followers you have the more successful. That I had to have my own URL, that I needed to get on each social media platform early and post often to make sure that I got followers. Somehow it fell under “need” rather than “want”. That this is simply how to get projects going, this is how the “work” is these days. I believed it and it helped to dim the magic of the internet for me.\n\nAll is not lost though, I get fleeting feelings of connection when I post deeper content or make requests. I recently asked for book recommendations and was surprised to find some people still respond with insight there. Twitter as well. Today I had an incredible video chat with my friend Cesar in Hong Kong over 3G as he biked home, a technology which would have been mind blowing in 2002.\n\nThis makes me wonder if there’s a lot of beauty and magic //still// happening online. That perhaps all is not lost, and that there is a greater amount of it on Minecraft, in discord servers, or in decentralized communities. What if my online experience is a mirror of myself and I’m getting out of it what I’m putting in. There is a diversity of people online. If I contain multitudes, what about the multitudes themselves?\n\nMy friend Pavel and I had a pokey question about the value of creating content that no one reads, that’s harder to scale with a tweet, that’s more than 140 characters long, that has no picture attached, that doesn’t even have a singing emoji or gif.\n\nLet’s take creation VS consumption. The tendency online for me is to trigger conversation rather than contribute. The tendency for me is to scroll or to go from one wiki link or article to the next, rather than to sit and contemplate or draw and share.\n\nArchitecture shapes reality, that’s for sure. Having a blog //is// very different than posting on facebook, that’s for sure. So it seems to me that first I need to determine first is who I want to be online and to find the enabling spaces that support that.\n\nWho would you like to be online?\n\nHere’s my commitment to trying to be who I want to be and sharing as I go.\n+BG",

(Limit 750 characters)\nIn my free time, I am an avid reader of interfaith studies seeking different answers to the question of \"what it means to be human\" and \"how to live a good life.\" We are in an age of globalization and a relative decline in the popularity of religious traditions to our detriment. \nI'm exploring how globalization and travel historically helped connect people of various traditions who then uncovered the commonly held beautiful truths. My current reads are: \"Common Ground Between Islam and Buddhism\" and \"Sufism and Taoism: A Comparative Study of Key Philosophical Concepts,\" - as I'm most interested in attempting to bridge between theistic and atheistic philosophical, religious traditions. \nShare an example of something you have been a part of, created, led or joined that you consider unique. Why do you think it is groundbreaking?  (Limit 1000 characters)\nFor me, the relationship I built with Saleh while we started a project together stands out as perhaps the most unique thing. We have formed a true brotherhood, something I haven't felt with any relationship outside it. Saleh and I built Beit Al Atlas in Beirut starting in 2016. It is a community home with the premise of connecting across socio-economic and cultural differences. \nWe started the Beit Al Atlas as an odd \"couple.\" I was then a 30 year old from Michigan and Saleh, a 16-year-old Palestinian Lebanese who grew up in a refugee camp in Syria. He taught me how to steal water when we ran out, and I taught him some English. He encouraged me to propose to my girlfriend, and I helped him cool off before settling a score with a drug dealer who slapped his father. These may seem like small things to others, but as someone who has always felt like an outsider, the home Saleh and I built together puts me at ease. And that is unique.\nIf you were a part of a group or team that did this work, please specify your individual role and contribution to this project team. (Limit 750 characters)\nI was one-half of the co-founding team, and Saleh was the other half. I heard Father Greg Boyle talk about how his work is inspired and motivated by friendship, and it inspired me so much. I was feeling conflicted about wanting to \"change the world,\" and this simple message led me to move to Lebanon, open my doors, and try as much as I could to become a better friend. \nMy contribution was to initiate the connections, set up the Facebook and Airbnb pages, bring my community through the doors, and help create and share the narrative. Saleh established the house infrastructure, invited his community from the more challenging parts of Beirut, and made sure we all remembered how to have fun. \n\n\nWhat questions should we have asked, but didn’t?

(Limit 750 characters)\nWhat's one thing you changed your mind about last year? \nWhen social entrepreneurs left Lebanon after the 2020 blast, I believed that the country experienced brain drain, which was a bad thing. Now I think it might be necessary. We cannot dictate how people should respond to trauma. In my master's degree research, I found that the people committed to positive social change experienced prior trauma and discussed lessons from it articulately. I realized that it's not about \"keeping people\" anywhere or incentivizing problem-solving with funds, that we all will experience hardship that can harden or soften us. And we can create spaces that reveal our natural inclinations to help each other, which emerges from a place of wholeness.\n\n\nCan you share a memorable story from your life that will give us a further sense of what drives you to do the work that you do? \n(Limit 750 characters)\nOne day I entered a temple designed for mourning and unexpectedly was forced to my knees crying uncontrollably. I spent the next few months exploring embodied trauma and unraveling how I operated in the past, not knowing that this grief was inside me. I lived so long believing that I could think critically and find truth and beautiful ways into the future. It wasn't until that day that I realized there are unseeable, powerful forces - which could be just under the surface of many of the conflicts we see in the world. This experience, amongst others, motivated me to bring well-being to the center of my work in the social change sector and bring the science of positive psychology into the social entrepreneurial ecosystem. \nWhat are you most hoping to achieve by becoming a TED Fellow? \nTo align with social change partners on measurement and interventions of wellbeing in programming. \nBuild a coalition refining the research behind the “well-being inspires well-doing” argument.\n(Limit 200 characters)\nHave you applied before?

      "content": "Research: \n\n1 - Post Traumatic Growth For Social Entrepreneurs \nInsights from the 2020 Beirut Port Explosion.\nBackground:\nThe decade of the 2020’s is marked by a series of compounding crises, the coronavirus pandemic, intensifying climactic events due to the climate crisis, and, relatedly, the increase in socio-political disorder. It is in this context this research has been conducted with a group of education oriented social entrepreneurs working in Lebanon. During our qualitative and quantitative study our participants experienced a combination of challenges from a currency devaluation, political instability and a large explosion in the center of Beirut. \n\nWe believe that developing educational experiences which promote post traumatic growth in this context is critical to support the development of an anti-fragile society. Thus we offer this paper as a contribution exploring the factors which contribute to our participant’s continued efforts in their entrepreneurial initiatives. Being social entrepreneurs, they are the future of stability in society, creating employment and addressing fundamental needs connected to SDGs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Protective Properties of Group Laughter \nHumor, Character Strengths and Deliberate Rumination For Social Entrepreneurs in Lebanon in Crisis\nFactors Contributing to Post Traumatic Growth for Social Entrepreneurs in Crisis\nBackground: In 2020 the world was challenged by a global pandemic. In Lebanon, the addition of an economic collapse and a major explosion in the capital city brought acute stressors, triggering migration ideation. In this study, we identify factors that support social entrepreneur’s access to post traumatic growth (PTG) by analyzing resilience and character strengths within an entrepreneurship training program in Beirut. \nMethods:  Over the course of Dec 2020 and April 2021 we gathered 21 hours and a half interviews with Lebanese social entrepreneurs going through an entrepreneurship training program, all of whom were living in Lebanon and experienced the August 2020 Beirut port explosion. Alongside these interviews we gathered a set of qualitative data including pre-post assessments of Character Strengths (VIA), Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTG-I), Intrusive and Deliberate Rumination (EERI), Entrepreneurial Intent (EI), Resilience (BRCS) and the Impact of Event - Revised (IES-R). Correlations were identified with factors that support PTG and social entrepreneurial ideation. \nResults: Character Strengths are correlated with PTG and there are validated methods for reliably developing strengths of character. One highly leverable strength is humor, and one way humor can support growth is by preventing helplessness. \nConclusions: While each person’s life journey is unique, we have identified that social entrepreneurship ideation is promoted by prior traumatic experiences if followed by opportunities and support for growth. Traumatic experiences are inescapable in life, and the opportunity educators and trainers have is to understand how to shift the trauma response curve towards growth. Deliberate Rumination, thinking and reflecting about one’s life circumstances can happen spontaneously and importantly they can be nurtured by incorporating them into group facilitations for training programs and schools. \nImplications:  The results of this study increases an understanding of the complex decision making individuals face in a crisis, and offers insights into the factors which support posttraumatic growth and social entrepreneurship. We hope the results of this paper inspire facilitators to incorporate humor, positive structured conversation and to enliven their program with character development. \nKeywords: Post Traumatic Growth, Social Entrepreneurship, Trauma, Lebanon, Training and Education, Character Strengths\nIntroduction: \nTrauma conscious pedagogies (Mays 2021) are becoming a widespread topic amongst educators in a post-covid-19 world, and in this paper we explore some factors and methodologies that can support growth during times of collective crisis. In 2020 the Lebanese people experienced the coronavirus pandemic, economic crisis as well as an explosion at the Beirut Port which killed over 200 people and left over 300,000 homeless in its wake. Working as an educator with social entrepreneurs in Lebanon we observed a growing frustration with the idea of resilience, with participants seeing it as a passive way oppressors remain in power while the population deals with the consequences of their mistakes. Rather than bounce back, we  began to explore the factors which promote Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) looking beyond resilience and recovery. We ask how can educators going through times of crisis promote anti-fragility, the ability to use difficulties as opportunities for growth?\n\nPeople respond differently to traumatic events and people’s Character Strengths can provide a framework to understand those responses as well as which traits may support individuals through times of crisis. Character Strengths are 24 relatively stable positive qualities in humans identified through a cross cultural analysis of what makes life worth living. Certain character strengths like kindness, social intelligence and hope have been demonstrated to protect against the negative effects of stress and trauma (Harzer 2015). It was also demonstrated that an overall growth in the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory is correlated with the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (Peterson et al. 2008). Importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence that there are character strength interventions that support people in developing their strengths (Schutte, N. S., & Malouff, J. M. 2018). Assessing the behaviors that promote PTG and life satisfaction, we find deliberate rumination as an important vector. (Triplett, K. N., Tedeschi, R. G., Cann, A., Calhoun, L. G., & Reeve, C. L. 2011) \n\nThe purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the factors that promote Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) to support educators working in environments undergoing crisis. Social enterprise support efforts are often funded and established in areas of need and therefore often the participants of these programs are likely to experience difficulties. add our evidence reinforcing the idea that nurturing character strengths as a whole, and hope, judgment, teamwork and humor in particular may increase the likelihood of growth after traumatic events. Previous studies demonstrate that Deliberate Rumination is a contributing factor for PTG and we have been able to identify judgment and teamwork as correlated Character Strengths. Lastly we recommend programs operating in areas and times of crisis to explore interventions to nurture the buffering Character Strengths of hope and humor while cultivating a group dynamic that can promote judgment and teamwork. \n\n\nTHE REST IS NEEDING TO BE CLEANED UP:\nMethodology\nWe’ve used a qualitative analysis method for the exploration of our research, in an attempt to identify potentially unforeseen variables. The author of this paper has been able to utilize their position as the head of Research And Development at Bloom, an organization which operates social enterprise education programs. Prior to the Beirut Port Explosion in August 2020, the participants and applicants for the Bloom social entrepreneurship accelerator program had taken the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory (VIA-IS). At the conclusion of the four months long accelerator, and following the Beirut Explosion, all applicants to the program requested to complete a post-test VIA-IS inventory, those in the program and those not selected.\n\nAn analysis of the pre/post test data for the VIA-IS demonstrated a buffering effect experienced by individuals who were a part of the Bloom program, which led to in-program individuals maintaining their overall VIA average while individuals outside the program experienced a significant drop. To understand this phenomenon was the genesis of this research, and inspired the qualitative/quantitative research methodology described below.\n\nQualitative Analysis: \nThe qualitative analysis consisted of twenty one 1.5 hour long interviews, which were all conducted remotely and recorded digitally. The interviewees were split with 10 people coming from outside the training program and 11 people who had gone through the training program (marked as “In prog.”). The questions for the interview were segmented into the following themes:\nTopic\nKey Insight Explored\nIntroduction and Background\nWork habits and family entrepreneurial background\nEthnographic Questions\nWhat is their educational/ family's income level?\nEntrepreneurial Intent (EI)\nWhat is their level of commitment to entrepreneurship?\nImpact of Event Scale (IES-R)\nWhat was the level of impact of the Beirut Explosion?\nResilience (BRCS)\nWhat is their level of resilience?\nPost Traumatic Growth Index \n(PTGI)\nHow much did people grow after the Beirut Explosion?\nRumination Scales \nWhat is the ratio of deliberate and intrusive rumination?\nConcluding Statements\nWhat does entrepreneurship mean in places facing instability?\n\n\nThe interview consisted of open-ended questions as well as questions requesting a qualitative response. Both questions were answered live on the call, allowing the interviewee to offer deeper context into the numerical responses. The audio for the interviews were transcribed manually, and an inductive process was followed to derive codes. The interview corpus was then brought into a software supporting bi-directional links through which code clusters were identified.\n\nQuantitative Data: \nDuring the semi-structured interview process, alongside the open-ended questions, the interviewer also gathered quantitative answers for the following measures:\nPost Traumatic Growth Index (PTGI Tedeschi & Calhoun 1996)\nThe Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS Sinclair and Wallson 2004)\nThe Impact of Event Scale: Revised (IES-R DS Weiss 2007)\nThe Intrusive - Event Related Rumination Inventory (EERI Cann et al., 2011)\nEntrepreneurial Intention (EI) scale derived from Luthje & Frank (2003); Duijn (2009) / Krueger et al. (2000)\nThe VIA Inventory referenced above. Peterson, C., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2004)\n\nA subset of the codes derived from the interview corpus were identified as meaningful segmentation markers, and each interview was then tagged in the database for analysis with the observed value.\n\nSegmentation Tags:\nProperty\nFields\nDescription\nHas_Therepist\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the individual attend therapy?\nInjury_From_Blast\nTrue/False/Unsure\nWas the interviewee injured in the Beirut Port Explosion?\nEntrepreneurial_Family\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the interviewee come from an entrepreneurial family?\nPlacebuilding_Ideation \nTrue/False/Unsure\nIs the interviewee committed to using their working life to contribute to society?\nMigration_Ideation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nIs the interviewee considering migrating out of Lebanon?\nRevolutionary_Ideation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the interviewee politically active, engage in protests, view their work as activism?\nIncome_Simplified\nLower/Middle/Upper\nHow does the participant view their families income bracket?\nMeditation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the participant have an active meditation practice?\n\nResults\nOverview of Data and Background Knowledge\nAfter a threatening situation, animals and humans respond in a variety of ways. Initially described by Walter Cannon (Cannon, W. B. 1915) as the Fight or Flight response, the theory has since then been adapted by Dr. Stephen Porges into Polyvagal theory (Porges 2009). This model now includes freezing as an alternative response, and attempts to correlate stress responses to neurohormonal responses. In the face of a situation in which no options seem viable, an individual can either choose to fight, flee (flight) or freeze. We will be using these three types of responses as a framing for potential ways our interviewees responded to the Beirut Blast.\n\nIn 2011, Martin Seligman (Seligman 2011) made the hypothesis that PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) comprises well-being, and argues that the model is helpful for measurement as well as for application (Seligman 2018). \nBefore we get into the analysis of the data, please review the prior description of the data and data gathering phase. If you would like to explore the data yourself, you can find a public dataset available to review here: http://bit.ly/cs-data-21 \n\nThe Character Strengths data was gathered as part of the application process for a social entrepreneurship program before the August 4th, 2020 explosion. After the explosion, to understand deeper changes in entrepreneurial ideation we conducted a second VIA-IS as well as a new questionnaire using the new measures described above. To start the exploration as to the factors which support social entrepreneurs we keep in mind the question: who grows as a social entrepreneur in times of adversity and who reprioritizes the notion of their career trajectory to focus more on self preservation. In 2008 Christopher Peterson (Peterson et al. 2008) demonstrated a positive correlation between the VIA-IS Character Strengths Inventory and the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). The PTGI measures growth on the dimensions of Appreciation, New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Spiritual Enhancement and Personal Strength; interestingly, all of these dimensions are relevant for social entrepreneurial ideation. Comparing PTGI with the Character Strengths assessment we identify that Humor, Teamwork, Spirituality, Prudence and Judgement have a significant correlation for PTGI across the five sub-dimensions, see figures below.\n\nData validity questions. \nWe initially hypothesized that there would be a correlation between CS prepost (Character Strengths Difference in average scores assessed before/after the blast) and Post Traumatic Growth. While there seems to be a slight correlation between CS prepost and PTGI - Appreciation (.33 p-val .14) we cannot at this time with our limited data make any strong statements about Character Strength changes before/after an explosion and PTGI. One factor could be that the time frame for the post test was taken over a 3 month period (December - March 2020) and it might be interesting to study a progression of changes rather than comparing pre and post. Growth takes time and measuring over an extended period confuses the data. Also, assessing people earlier, and therefore closer to the period of the traumatic event may not have left time to metabolize the experience while people who filled in the assessment later have had more opportunities. Another bias that may be influencing the data is potentially the types of people who submit forms early compared to those who wait may also capture proactive people early in the recovery process and procrastinators later in their process. Rather than adding another factor to control for procrastination, I propose future assessments to include deadlines for inclusion into the dataset, or to include time of receipt as an influencing factor. \n \nAnd now, we begin to explore motivation and wellbeing for entrepreneurs following the Fight, Flight and Freeze framework. \nFight\nAfter the Beirut Explosion, many of the interviewees were feeling anger. Although anger may be seen as a negative state, we found that many of the participants used their anger towards a factor we called Revolutionary Ideation, clicking this link will take you to see sections of the interview tagged with this concept. \n\n“Angry at the government, of course. Angry that the city I love was destroyed. The nice things about our city were destroyed in a second because of the irresponsibility of the people governing. Of course I went to the protest that happened immediately after” - Interview 006\n\nSome people went to the streets to protest, while others viewed their entrepreneurial activity as their “action” in response: \n\n“With the revolution came many different revolutions... one of the revolutions we're making is in education. And I say that I'm an activist  and not on the ground - it's our revolution in education. I don't think the revolution is only about going down and doing it violently. It's about rethinking, unlearning, recreating. Putting aside everything traditional / forced upon us / trying to make a difference. not just to make money. Money is not the aim, it's the reward. It's not the reward I'm aiming for. The impact is the aim I want. There's lots, revolutions in media, education, revolution in feminism/sexuality. This awareness is coming out and has been a social revolution not only (taboo). Not just a gov /political revolution, it's everything. This is my revolution.”\n-Interview 019\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, the majority of participants with revolutionary ideation came from people who were not intending to leave Lebanon, even after the blast. While revolutionary thinking and political engagement is not the primary focus of this paper, it is worth being included here since many of the inspiration for social entrepreneurs comes from areas the public sector is lacking in, and can be seen as a form of direct action. Most of the social entrepreneurs interviewed for this paper were operating businesses solving problems in the domain of education. \n\nAnother important reason to consider the idea of “Fighting” and using the feeling of Anger is that it is a fact bound to happen, especially when paired with major traumatic events. So rather than avoiding the feeling, we can sublimate anger to increase the critical factor of engagement to prevent freezing, complacency, and inaction. While the language of fighting is not necessarily positive, it does imply a high degree of activation and purpose, something important to maintain in the face of conflict and insurmountable odds. \n\nThe measure we’ve selected for “Fight” is resilience, labeled BRCS  (Sinclair and Walston 2004), it measures the following questions on a 5 point scale:\nI look for creative ways to alter difficult situations. \nRegardless of what happens to me, I believe I can control my reaction to it. \nI believe I can grow in positive ways by dealing with difficult situations. \nI actively look for ways to replace the losses I encounter in life.\n\nActing as an antidote to the potential freezing reflex, resilience inspires action and engagement. While focusing on character strengths development has been shown to support wellbeing factors described by PERMA (Goodman & Kauffman 2017), there appears to be a subset that stands out in our set of interviews. The components of this subset are the following : Hope, Humor, Self-Regulation, Social-Intelligence and Teamwork. We can see that these are especially correlated with resilience, and may be interesting to explore as in future studies. \nWhat might not support direct engagement? The following table presents negative correlations between Revolutionary Ideation that we can find identified in the data, there are no strong positive correlations to present. \n\n\nThe relationships that stand out to me are the relationship between Prudence, having a child and Revolutionary Ideation. Prudent parents are less likely to be engaged in protests and other types of activism. Another strong correlation is with Spirituality. Diving into how one mother responded to the explosion we can see both features at play:\n\n“No, nothing changed. God's will will still happen as it should. Nothing has changed. I worked as a mother to prevent the impact from impacting my children much so they don't stay home alone. I didn't have much capacity to go to the site to volunteer. Fadi my brother was there and saw the fire that became the blast and was more present. I personally focused on making sure my children would cross this situation without harm. Fadi worked on support.”\n-013 Interview Spirituality rank 7/24 & Has_Child True\n\nWhile the strength of Spirituality contributes positively to Post Traumatic Growth through the “Spiritual Enhancement” facet, there is a concern that over-focusing on the strength of spirituality could lead to spiritual bypassing, which is a coping strategy where people use spiritual ideas to avoid facing unresolved emotional issues and development tasks. Spiritual bypassing was coined by John Welwood and developed in (Cashwell, C. S., Glosoff, H. L., & Hammond, C. 2010). \n\n\nInterviewee number 18 expressed the balance between trusting in the “Will of God” and developing and engaging in acts of control like this:\n“We do have control over that, if it's going to happen it's going to happen. If maybe we knew about it, maybe it's going to happen anyway. We're destined to have this. There's a saying in the (The Islamic Spiritual Tradition), aqqqalal (Arabic for use your brain/do something rational) watawakal (Arabic for rely on God) - before submitting (to the will of God) do what you have to do. DO what we should do and at the end of the day what's going to happen is going to happen.”\n-018 Interview \n\nFigure 6 in the figures section below displays an interesting chart exposing some relationships between meditation, spirituality, revolutionary / social ideation. Spirituality is correlated with not having a therapist perhaps indicating that people with a stronger spiritual practice don’t identify with the need to find a therapist. This is interesting because it seems that having a therapist correlates with deliberate rumination and meditation. Reviewing age seems to indicate that the younger generations are more open to therapy and meditation alongside their religious and spiritual beliefs. \n\nOne takeaway from the above analysis is that creating mixed communities of practice where various spiritual, religious, therapeutic ideas are shared openly might create an opportunity for alternative perspectives to be displayed and their results seen, either amplifying or dampening the ideas that the group selects as valuable. This might be an important task for course designers and facilitators to navigate carefully. 013 expressed a value in action by nurturing their child, while 019 demonstrated Bravery and a rallying cry to contribute socially in a time of revolutionary change. In relation to the theme of this section, both of them are putting up a good fight and are engaged in a values informed course of action.\n\nFlight\nTraumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image and worldviews, and while possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and positive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how people choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous section we described people who engage (flight), this time, let’s discuss migration (flight).\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic happens. Prior to the blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge where the World Bank data indicates that about 40 percent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates leave Lebanon upon graduation (WorldBank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what the migration impact of the explosion will be, the total population of Lebanon has dropped .44% last year and (Ibrahim 2020) reports that the number of people leaving Lebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the blast. Understanding the decision making process of social entrepreneurs is critical since they are an important part of the population working on creating stability and creating positive reasons for people to stay, either through their services, as employees or customers. \n\nThis snippet of dialog from an interview demonstrates in real time holding multiple perspectives and ends with a contradiction, to desire to want to stay. \n\n“For instance if I had kids. If I was in Beirut/ lost a close family member I may have thought I would leave. Fortunately for me I don't’, it’s related to how much they can take. My brother is leaving for France in September, I can't leave everyone/my family. We have the family business, my father is relatively old. And I want to stay here willingly.”\n-004 Interview\n\nThe research strategy was initially going to divide the population into “those who stay and build” and “those who leave and protect themselves and their families” - during the coding process we found that the decision is emotional some people want to leave and contribute, and some want to stay and contribute, and many others have competing commitments that are unclear. Sometimes the interviewee demonstrates deep self knowledge and desires to leave for strategic reasons, to continue to be able to offer their work life as a service to their community they need to stay safe, sane and alive: \n\n“I won't lie, sometimes I feel like leaving too. Why do I think about it? To keep this engine/enthusiasm/giving to people I have to feel secure. Not that I will die at any instant. So much is online so I can do so much of my work online. I can be effective even if I’m not physically in the country. I think of my safety, my family… and my earnings. Now I’m fine. After a while will I still be fine? I’m investing from my income, will I still be able to invest in my team? That’s the one thing I’m thinking about. I’m investing in the base, raising this “child” so that one day the company will come and pay me back and take care of me when I’m older. Thank goodness God has given me a salary. I see tangible results. We’re going to print the book and sell it and make money from it. I can see it all. It's not like we’re playing and not doing anything.\n-002 Interview\n\nThis powerful snippet from the interview shows the strategic process 002 has taken to rationalize her potential departure from Lebanon. Some questions arise as to how much the combination of the massive spread of the coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown supports people in their migration ideation. It could be that as people have spent much of 2020 indoors people now, like 002, have taken their social entrepreneurship programs online and have less of a physical investment in their physical environments.\n\nOther interviewees have a clearer commitment to leaving and do not seem conflicted in any way:\n“I live with my mom/brother. And we are all affected by the situation of course. Because before that - the port - we already had the economic situation and we were feeling safe since a long time nothing happened security wise. we heard it could happen again. We don't feel safe anymore.\nI don't have foreign nationality, so I decided not to take a French one. It's complicated to find a job, it's a safe thing to do to have a possibility if one has to go outside Lebanon. I would be interested in leaving if I had an opportunity. Someone said for Canada. Someone said it's very far and they don't take Lebanese for my age. For security reasons I could go to France for example. It's a sure avenue, I need a challenge in my life. I don't like routine.”\n-Interview 017\n\n“Participants who maintain calm and develop adaptive self-regulating practices  Actually my thinking is everyone is thinking about leaving. Something inside me that doesn't want to leave despite everything. I don't know why I'm still calm. I see the craziness all around us. The best thing you can do is focus with what you have, and how you can help others with what you have. If you focus on all the bad things around us you can't work. What I decided is to help and doing what I can do and keeping my mental health and family health and that's how to survive everything. Of course we felt very bad and it was very stressful for us and all these feelings. I just wanted to stay calm.”\n-014 Interview\n\nAlbert Bandura’s Social Cognition Theory (Bandura 1989) proposes that a portion of knowledge acquisition comes from social evaluation, from our data we see that people modulate their migration ideation based on many factors, one of which is how and who they speak to about it. Traumatic events disrupt the standard narrative model needing new stories to support meaning, suggests Neimeyer in (Neimeyer, R. A. (2004), how are those narratives reconstructed? In a paper developing a model of Post Traumatic Growth for cancer patients (Morris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J. 2011) identified Deliberate Rumination as a strong influencing factor for PTG. Further research demonstrated the relationship between PTG and life satisfaction through the factor of meaning:\n\nIn the paper (Triplett et al. - 2012), they demonstrated that the disruption of core beliefs (CBIs) triggers both intrusive and deliberate rumination and that the destabilizing aspects of a traumatic event either supports a more meaningful life of satisfaction through deliberately contemplating the experience, or can negatively affect meaning and life satisfaction through intrusive rumination. \n\nDeliberate Rumination is the process of choosing the questions and thoughts one has around a traumatic event, for instance “what is the lesson I am learning through this” in contrast with Intrusive Rumination and Brooding which may take the tone of “why is this always happening to me”. We can see both examples in our interview data set. Observe as 018 reflects on discussions had during a group dialog with other social entrepreneurs in the entrepreneurial training program:\n“...First I was thinking if we stay in this country, I can do anything in this country. Nothing limiting me, why would I leave this country.... Why ... maybe I should have a backup country if something unexpected happens. Just having this backup country in mind can help me (with my project). … Then(the start of the program) (projectName) (personName) starting asking which country do you want to go to? And I started thinking, first that ... I have friends, good nature, why leave? Then after the blast I have a different perspective of the country and started thinking of where I can go when/if something unexpected happens.”\n--018 Interview\nOther examples of social cognition supporting someone positively through social media and describing the importance of having a community of positive social support to help create a sense of control and meaning as he adjusts his worldview through the development of spiritual and meditative practices: \n“A lot lot lot lot. After the blast I was majorly helped - writing affirmations. It helped me so much. I was in complete loss, not knowing what's happening, what the point of anything is. Self existence questions that you ask yourself. One of the major affirmations, I am control of my reality even in times of uncertainty.\nThere's a beautiful instagram, called affirmation addict. Girl in California, I don't have the application. I have a journal. I have a routine. Every two weeks. I cleanse my home with spiritual music. I started yoga. More meditation. I did a retreat for 5 days [...]\nI always have curiosity to learn more about these. They came at the right time. I have friends who are more spiritual bess (but) i'm doing it alone. At my own pace. I have a collective of friends around me that I'm inspired by.”\n-020 Interview\n\nIncluding moments of Deliberate Rumination in a social setting where trust is first established can potentially support PTG. Including a focus on Strengths which support individuals' sense of life satisfaction and overall wellbeing is hypothesized to set a state of mind conducive to positive Deliberate Rumination. \nThe set of character strengths associated with our Deliberate Rumination dimension is Judgement, Social Intelligence and Teamwork. These traits do intuitively make sense as critical factors for deliberate rumination and working together as a community to make difficult collective decisions about traveling, building and relationships. We hope that by bringing a greater awareness to these strengths of character people and programs will benefit from clearer thinking and more open discussion on what to do after difficulties arise. \nFreeze… or Laugh\nThe third  response individuals have in the face of an overwhelmingly negative situation is to freeze. In our interviews, we identify initial stages after the blast where many people felt stuck through expressing feelings of exasperation and frustration at the situation. Indicating they sense a loss of control. These aspects connect to Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) through negating the opposite, post traumatic stress. Some of the symptoms of PTS are freezing, feeling numbness, an inability to act or care, holding one’s breath, a sense of dread… \n\nWhile it’s important not to overstate the case of PTS, in fact, most people respond quite resiliently as proposed by (Bonanno, G. A. 2004), also in order for people to experience the positive effects of PTG even the challenges and stressors of ordinary life can be enough of a trigger to stimulate benefits (Ewert, A., & Tessneer, S. 2019). Before exploring people’s stress let’s explore the positive correlations between PTGI and Character Strengths:\n\nThe majority of the connection comes through the facet of PTGI-Appreciation. \n\n\n “...It's useless, they are not serving us by doing this. (Sharing news about the situation) They are producing anger that can't turn into anything. The people are already angry from the economic issue. They don't have proof. One can sit and do theories for hours.”\n017 Interview \n\n“Khalas(exasperated form of “enough” in Arabic). I can't control anything… I need to control my feelings thoughts rage. \n-020 Interview\n\nAfter a month, yeah. In the first month I was consuming a lot of news about it and then I decided to stop. I was just depressing myself and I couldn't do anything about it and I disconnected completely and living my life as if nothing was going on. [[Code: Response-Self Protection]] I wasn't in Beirut, It wasn't as traumatic I was in Sawfar\n006 Interview \n\n“I didn't force myself to deal, when I wanted to cry. I was crying, when I didn't feel willing to do anything I didn't do anything.”\n010 Interview\n\nRather than freezing in response, some of the interviewees exhibited avoidant behaviors, which parallel freezing:\n\n“After the blast I didn't go to Beirut until just now. It was too heartbreaking, I didn't want to see it. We were impacted from the protests and the views. I was in a state of denial I didn't want to believe that this has happened. I only went yesterday because I //HAD// to get a vaccine. In some buildings you see the effects of the blast, in other buildings it's been cleaned up.”\n010 Interview\n\nContrast the preceding statements with following statements which demonstrate interviewees engaging in highly motivated activities following the explosion:\n\n“When the blast happened, most businesses closed and people were cleaning up... When I was in gbeili - company, not antwork. I was looking at the employees and was thinking, don't you want to be in beirut helping other people? You could just go there and do something, this paperwork could be done another day.”\n019 Interview \n\n“I still have nightmares, I have PTSD. Do you really want to know what it's like? I had some calls with people from projectName. And suddenly the glass office I was in all collapsed and the couch I was sitting on was full of glass. Allah itlatuf (God intervened with mercy) it was a matter of minutes. I was caught up on my way down to the floor below with my manager having a silly discussion when the blast happened. And the whole lower floor was full of blood, everyone had to be taken to the hospital. We were so scared to move. Because there were two we expected a third. We all thought we were being blasted. Because of this we created a (product in response), it was a determination for us that (curseword) it we're staying. We're doing this for the country despite all the (curse) we're living through. It was created after the blast as a demonstration that we want to manufacture here, we want to create jobs, we want to build something for the kids that are deprived of toys, their childhood even.” https://roamresearch.com/#/app/EntrepreneurialResearch/page/ISYEjUAMD\n\nAggregating the pre-post tests from all the assessments we have before and after the blast, we found that by segmenting our assessments by individuals in the entrepreneurial training program, they have - on average - a one point increase in the measure of Humor in the VIA-IS inventory, over the course of the program. While Humor may be under-studied in academia, it correlates with the CS prepost variable in our dataset. \n\n“CS Prepost” is a measure of the overall change in Character Strength before and after the Beirut Port Explosion. In the following table, we observe that humor and creativity both are factors affecting the preservation of Character Strengths. We used JASP and a classical regression matrix since the variables are all continuous variables.  \n\nSo what is a theory behind humor and this buffering effect? Humor has been linked to adaptive coping and keeping a “light attitude” in the face of adversity (Ruch and Hofmann 2017). Humor is also an active response to take when other options are unavailable: people “break” the silence with laughter, for example. This may be preventing the processes which lead to Learned Helplessness. Learned helplessness is one way to view the opposite of post traumatic growth for people living in highly chaotic and destabilized situations. Initially Learned Helplessness theory implied that dogs experiencing inescapable shocks learned helplessness and persisted in helpless behavior even when the situation became escapable later. \n\nRecent research has shed light on the neurological underpinnings of learned helplessness which has application in uncertain times (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). Previously Learned Helplessness, as the name suggests, theorized that higher level mammals learn helpless behaviors when they are given inescapable negative experiences. Passivity in the face of a changed situation, a situation where it behooves the animal to take action, is the hallmark of learned helplessness. And while that behavior doesn’t change, our understanding of how it comes to be has. Mammals, when confronted with prolonged adverse situations, develop an unlearned response of passivity. It is possible to overcome this bias towards passivity by learning and exerting control. What behaviors are available to act on?\n\nOne additional mechanism could have explanatory strength is the Broaden and Build theory (Fredrickson B. L. 2004) which espouses that positive emotions support people in expansive activities, and taking action builds new capacity for further positive emotion, expansive activities and capacities. Humor combines the psychological insight and research from Fredrickson with the neurological understandings of modern Learned Helplessness theory from (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). We can see that Humor is correlated with an overall growth of character strengths from before and after the blast(CS prepost). Humor stands out as one of the only factors that is directly connected to growth and stands out as a unique lens to look at both PTG(PTGI) and Resilience(BRCS) as it ties them all together as can be seen in the following chart:  \nThe court jester is the only person able to speak the truth when there is a crippling fear gripping the court. Humor breaks the ice and we propose that it may also help sustain the neurological basis for control. Humor is one of the factors we are exploring in this paper along the dimension of growth, the other is self reflection and emotional reappraisal through Deliberate Rumination and the third is Engagement as manifested in anger/political action as well as social entrepreneurial ideation. \nHumor, Engagement & Deliberate Rumination\nDiscussion\n4.1 Implications and future directions\n4.2 Limitations \nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we investigated the Character Strength correlations with Resilience, Post Traumatic Growth and Deliberate Rumination. Since Character Strengths are correlated with Post Traumatic Growth and Wellbeing, and since there is a collection of applied interventions with scientific validity, we hope this analysis helps educators working inside and outside conflict. The idea of “pre-silience” (pre+resilience) applies here with the recommendations for actions being more helpful in situations before there is a traumatic event. \nLet’s review the frame and identify the correlated character strengths:\n\nHeading\n\n\nSDT\nMeasure -> Support\nCorrelated Character Strengths\nFight \nEngagement anger/political social entrepreneurial ideation. \n\n\nAutonomy\nResilience -> Engagement\nHope, Humor, Self-Regulation, Social-Intelligence and Teamwork. \nFlight\nDeliberate Rumination\nself reflection and emotional reappraisal\nRelatedness\nDeliberate Rumination -> Dialog\nJudgement, Social Intelligence and Teamwork. \nFreeze\nGrowth \nHumor\nCompetency\nPTGI -> Growth\nAppreciation of Beauty, Fairness, Humor, Judgement, Leadership, Modesty/Humility, Perspective, Prudence, Social Intelligence, Spirituality and Teamwork\n\n\nThe strengths that correlate with motivation and wellbeing with the highest correlations are Teamwork, Social Intelligence and Judgement. \n\nThe total list of strengths which emerged from our analysis is:\nAppreciation of Beauty\nFairness\nHope\nHumor\nJudgement \nLeadership\nModesty/Humility\nPrudence\nPerspective\nSelf-Regulation\nSocial Intelligence\nSpirituality \nTeamwork \n\nEveryone makes different decisions after a traumatic event, one size does not fit all in terms of how best to design a pedagogy for social entrepreneurs. We hope this paper inspires more exploration around increasing motivation and wellbeing before the traumatic event, generating “presilience” so that when challenges come the psychological and social support are already in place. \n\nOne thing is becoming more clear, it’s important to create spaces for truth speaking in the social entrepreneurship community, we must talk about our failures and fears as well as our successes. These spaces can be where people explore ways of being and inspire each other through positive open discussion around Character Strengths. These spaces could be a counter to the negativity bias seen on both social and traditional media. They offer a facilitated space to practice deliberate rumination with the positive guidance of facilitators. It also supports the spread of value-laden idioms, aphorisms, and other easily digestible ideas, which become heuristics for decision making. \n\nThe Character Strengths above come from a small sample study and the correlations do not imply causation. I hope this paper inspires others to take an applied approach to character strengths explorations and also publish their data openly to build up a stronger evidence base for Character Strengths interventions. \n\nI hope these findings make their way into communities of practice where social entrepreneurs can collectively support each other to create the next viable steady-state system wherever they are. \nI want to end with two insights, one from one of the participants of the study and one from a famous author:\n\n“...Values are the base of every human reaction and really, there's courage and motivation in every person that's hidden and this very sad event created or awakened values in people. Those of compassion and courage, of motivation of solidarity and nationalism. Inspire nationalism even as people as they leaving the country. The people that are leaving the country, they still say my dream is to come back one day to Lebanon. \nMaybe they will go and come back.”\n--Interview 017\n\n “If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.” \n-Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\n\nStrengths to develop. The character strengths that have a developmental trajectory; that is, they are least common in youth and need to increase over time through cognitive maturation are: appreciation of beauty & excellence, forgiveness, modesty, open-mindedness (Park & Peterson, 2006a; 2006b).\n\n\n\nIn (Triplett, K. N., Tedeschi, R. G., Cann, A., Calhoun, L. G., & Reeve, C. L. 2011) the researchers described the nodes in the dynamical system of someone going through a traumatic experience as Core Beliefs. Previous research by Christopher Peterson has demonstrated that improvements in Character Strengths are correlated with improvements in the Post Traumatic Growth Index, for people that experience major life difficulties (Peterson 2008). And, importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence that there are character strength interventions that support people in developing their strengths (Schutte, N. S., & Malouff, J. M. 2018). \n\nThis inquiry eventually allowed us to identify factors which support social entrepreneurs along the three dimensions of responding to the blast: fighting, fleeing or freezing. We’ve mapped them to the Self Determination Theory (SDT) of Motivation (Deci & Ryan 2008) (Autonomy, Mastery and Relatedness). \n\nAfter a threatening situation, animals and humans respond in a variety of ways. Initially described by Walter Cannon (Cannon, W. B. 1915) as the Fight or Flight response, the theory has since then been adapted by Dr. Stephen Porges into Polyvagal theory (Porges 2009). This model now includes freezing as an alternative response, and attempts to correlate stress responses to neurohormonal responses. In the face of a situation in which no options seem viable, an individual can either choose to fight, flee (flight) or freeze. We will be using these three types of responses as a framing for potential ways our interviewees responded to the Beirut Blast.\n\nIn 2011, Martin Seligman (Seligman 2011) made the hypothesis that PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) comprises well-being, and argues that the model is helpful for measurement as well as for application (Seligman 2018). \n\nIn 2008 it was demonstrated that an overall growth in the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory was correlated with the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (Peterson et al. 2008). Traumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image and worldviews, and while possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and positive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how people choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous section we described people who engage (flight), this time, let’s discuss migration (flight).\n\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic happens. Prior to the blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge where the World Bank data indicates that about 40 percent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates leave Lebanon upon graduation (WorldBank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what the migration impact of the explosion will be, the total population of Lebanon has dropped .44% last year and (Ibrahim 2020) reports that the number of people leaving Lebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the blast. One additional mechanism could have explanatory strength is the Broaden and Build theory (Fredrickson B. L. 2004) which espouses that positive emotions support people in expansive activities, and taking action builds new capacity for further positive emotion, expansive activities and capacities. Humor combines the psychological insight and research from Fredrickson with the neurological understandings of modern Learned Helplessness theory from (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). We can see that Humor is correlated with an overall growth of character strengths from before and after the blast(CS prepost).\nThe first sentence of the first paragraph should pick up some or most of the words from the title.

To date, no studies have examined the barriers that Palestinian medical students face in accessing hospitals for clinical training. The objectives of this study were to characterize these barriers and understand how they affect Palestinian students’ medical education and quality of life.\nMethods: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 4th-6th year medical students from Al-Quds University to participate in focus group discussions. A total of 36 students participated in the discussions. Transcripts of the discussions were coded to identify major themes.\nResults: Palestinian medical students expressed facing numerous challenges during their clinical training. Students emphasized the difficulties of obtaining permits to train at Jerusalem hospitals, including arbitrary permit rejections and long wait times. Significant delays, searches, and mistreatment at checkpoints during their commute to hospitals were particularly burdensome. The majority of students who participated in the focus groups felt that their education and quality of life had been strongly negatively affected by their experience trying to access hospital training sites.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that medical students living and studying in the occupied Palestinian territories receive sub-optimal training due to ambiguous permit rules, barriers at checkpoints, and the psychological burden of the process. These results highlight the impact that military occupation has on the education and quality of life of Palestinian medical students in a setting in which there is regular violence and many health indicators are already poor.\nKeywords: Occupation, Palestine, Medical education, West Bank, Al-Quds University, Medical students\n\n\n\n\na Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02446, USA b Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA\nc Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA\nARTICLE INFO\nKeywords:\nFemale genital cutting United States Diaspora\nImmigration\nReligion Vacation cutting\nABSTRACT\nThis study documents the perceptions and experiences of immigrant women and men in the US related to female genital cutting (FGC). This paper examines the effects of migration on these perceptions, with the goal of op- timizing health services and informing public policy to support women who have undergone FGC. This quali- tative study consisted of individual interviews conducted from 2014 to 2015 with 42 women and men living in Boston, Massachusetts, who immigrated from a variety of communities where FGC has been practiced. Most participants felt strongly against the continuation of the practice, describing a change in their personal and community viewpoints over time, which they attributed to education, religion and immigration. The men in our study collectively took a stand against FGC and believed that they had a particular duty to raise awareness in their families and their communities about its physical and emotional harms. Our study provides strong support for the inclusion of men, religious leaders, and immigrants in FGC-related efforts. Our unique preliminary ex- ploration of the role of members of the diaspora provides some support for initiatives that would involve emigrants in the effort to curb FGC in their home countries. Changing views in the diaspora could play a sig- nificant role in affecting opinions and practices in contexts where FGC is prevalent. Finally, our findings do not support the fear that “vacation cutting” might be common among US immigrants. We should therefore exercise caution in our promotion of legislation and clinical practices that target this fear.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\n  \nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\nSocial Science & Medicine\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/socscimed\n \nPerspectives on female genital cutting among immigrant women and men in T Boston\nS. Shahawya,∗, H. Amanuelb, N.M. Nourc\n \n1. Introduction\nThe World Health Organization defines “female genital mutilation” as a procedure involving removal of or injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons (WHO, 2008). More than 200 million women and girls have undergone female genital cutting (FGC) globally, with an additional 3 million girls under the age of 18 “at risk” each year (WHO, 2008). While the practice varies widely, much research has shown that women who undergo FGC face negative health and social consequences (Ball, 2008; Utz-Billing and Kentenich, 2008; WHO, 2008). FGC is classified into different types (WHO, 2014): Type 1 in- volves removing part or all of the clitoris or the prepuce. Type 2, in- volves removing part or all of the clitoris and labia minora, with or without the labia majora. Type 3, called infibulation or pharaonic, in- volves removing part or all of the external genitalia and narrowing the vaginal orifice by reapproximating the labia minora and/or labia ma- jora. Type 4 encompasses all other harmful procedures to the genitalia\nfor non-medical reasons. The term sunna, meaning “prophetic tradi- tion”, is generally used to describe non-infibulating forms of FGC.\n1.1. The United States\nIn 1996, the United States Congress banned FGC. In 2000, Brigham and Women's Hospital's African Women's Health Center used census data to estimate that 228,000 girls living in the US had either under- gone or were at risk of FGC. This represented approximately a 35% increase from the 1990 census data (Nour et al., 2006). More recent estimates tell us that 513,000 girls under the age of 18 in the US are now at risk of FGC—more than three times the number in 1990 (Goldberg et al., 2016). Researchers attribute this increase in estimated number of girls at risk to increased migration from FGC-practicing countries as well as a change in the estimation technique to include both first and second generation girls (Goldberg et al., 2016).\n∗ Corresponding author.

The persistence of FGC\nVarious reasons have been cited for the persistence of FGC including its role as a rite of passage, the preservation of chastity, ensuring marriageability, religious requirements, hygiene, and enhancing sexual pleasure for men (Nour, 2008; WHO, 2008; Mackie and LeJeune, 2009). A systematic review of 21 studies of members of communities that practiced FGC but reside in Western countries pointed to six key factors underpinning FGC: cultural traditions, sexual morals, marriageability, religion, health benefits, and male sexual enjoyment (Berg and Dension., 2013). In almost all the studies included in that review, FGC was referred to as a meaningful and valued cultural practice linked to honor and the preservation of chastity, enforced through community mechanisms. The current study seeks to avoid oversimplifying the practice and immigrants’ perceptions of it by presenting complex and often contrasting views among a diverse set of immigrant women and men.\n1.3. Community based research in immigrant populations\nSome research has examined perceptions and experiences of FGC in African diasporic communities in the United States (Akinsulure-Smith, 2014; Connor et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2009; McNeely and Jong, 2016). A qualitative study among 30 female Somali refugees in Min- nesota found that participants endorsed negative attitudes towards FGC, largely secondary to health consequences as well as a new un- derstanding that FGC is not sanctioned religiously (Connor et al., 2016). A qualitative study among 13 Somali refugees in Colorado found that all participants reported having changed their views on FGC after moving, often due to education, migration, and dissociation of the practice from religious beliefs (McNeely and Jong, 2016). Lastly, a study among Somali immigrant women about their challenging FGC- related healthcare experiences in the US emphasized the importance of engaging in community-based participatory research using mixed- methods to build trust-based networks and actively engage community members in the research process (Johnson et al., 2009).\nThere is also research on FGC among African diasporic communities outside the United States (Abdulcadir et al., 2016; Jaldesa and Abdi 2014; Vloeberghs et al. 2012). A study in Nairobi found that Ethiopian immigrants viewed FGC as a tool to curb female sexuality and enforce fixed gender roles upon women; those researchers called for commu- nity-based education programming involving religious leaders, NGOs, government ministries, and other actors (Jaldesa and Abdi 2014). A study of immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa residing in Hamburg, Germany found that most immigrants speak out for the abandonment of FGC, but that there is a solid minority who maintain either positive or indifferent attitudes towards the practice (Behrendt, 2011). Other stu- dies also reflect this overwhelming rejection of FGC after immigration (Johnsdotter et al., 2007), while some studies delineate certain groups of immigrants that may tend to have more traditional views towards the practice, such as males, older generations, and new arrivals (Morison et al., 2004). There are differing views on the kind of effect the process of migration has on the viewpoints of immigrants on FGC. One fra- mework might suggest that immigrants may cling more strongly to cultural norms such as FGC in an effort to retain their cultural identity, while an opposing theory might suggest that immigrants are more likely to abandon a practice such as FGC in the process of assimilation (Berry, 1997).\n1.4. Men's perspectives\nFew studies in the US have explored the varied perspectives of men on FGC. A recent study in Somalia indicated that 96% of men preferred to marry women who have undergone FGC but that women were less likely than men to support FGC (Almroth et al., 2001). Similarly, a study in Oslo found that Somali immigrant men were more likely than\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nwomen to support continuation of the practice (Gele et al., 2015). However, a qualitative study in the US found that male Somali refugees were aware of FGC-related morbidities and did not support the practice, while many women seemed supportive (Johnson-Agbakwu et al., 2014). More detailed comparisons of men and women's views in the US are needed to determine how perceptions of FGC itself and FGC-tar- geted interventions might be similar or different across gender lines.\n1.5. Objectives\nThis study documents the FGC-related perceptions and experiences of immigrant women and men in Boston, Massachusetts, and attempts to understand the effect of migration on these perceptions, with the larger goal of optimizing health services and informing public policy to support women who have undergone FGC. Our study is unique in considering not only the views of women who have undergone FGC (not simply all women from FGC-practicing countries), but also the views of immigrant men from the same communities. Furthermore, this study investigates the nature of FGC-related communication between mem- bers of the diaspora and relatives in their communities of origin across Africa and the Middle East—an important facet of the subject that past studies have not investigated.\n2. Methods\nWe designed a qualitative study consisting of individual interviews in Boston, Massachusetts, with immigrant women who experienced FGC themselves and immigrant men with family members who had experienced FGC, to explore their views on the practice and the dis- course surrounding it. We report our qualitative research in accordance with the COREQ criteria (Tong et al., 2007).\n2.1. Ethics, consent, and permissions\nThis study was approved by the Brigham and Women's Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB). Informed consent was obtained verbally and participants were provided with a study information sheet. No compensation or incentives were given to study participants.\n2.2. Topic guide\nThe topic guides for the interviews were created by the researchers based on gaps in the literature related to the perspectives and experi- ences of people in the US who immigrated from communities where FGC has been practiced. The topic guides, one tailored to men and the other to women [Appendix A] were reviewed for content, clarity, and cultural sensitivity by Harvard Medical School faculty of both African and Middle Eastern descent. The topic guides consisted of three sec- tions: participants’ personal views on FGC and the cultural and social factors that have affected their views; personal experiences with FGC and its long-term effects; and perceptions of community views of the practice both in their countries of origin and in the US diaspora.\n2.3. Sampling\nConvenience sampling was used to recruit both women and men living in Boston who had immigrated from communities where FGC has been practiced, including parts of Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates. Inclusion cri- teria included women and men above 18 years of age who immigrated from these countries and now live in Boston. For women, it was ne- cessary that they themselves had undergone FGC. For men, it was ne- cessary that they had a family member who had undergone FGC. Individuals who were below 18 years of age or women who had not undergone FGC were excluded.\nHalf of the participants were recruited through the African Women's\n332\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nHealth Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital, an obstetrical and gynecologic clinic for women who have experienced FGC. The re- maining participants were recruited through the local mosque, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center (ISBCC), and the Eritrean Community Center of Greater Boston. In the African Women's Health Center, eligible patients were first introduced to the study in private rooms by nurses. If potential participants were interested in hearing more about the study, they were introduced by the nurses to the re- search team. At the local community and religious centers, center vo- lunteers introduced the study to constituents. Interested community members then met privately with the research team to hear more about the study. Two researchers on the team informed potential participants about the details of the study. If they agreed to participate, they were provided with an information sheet in their language about the study and then gave verbal consent. Interviews were then conducted one-on- one. After the interviews, participants were asked whether their part- ners, relatives, or friends in their communities would be willing to participate (snowball sampling). If so, a separate interview date was set up to consent and interview additional participants.\n2.4. Interviews\nInterviews were conducted in a semi-structured format between July 2014 and 2015 until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews ranged between 20 and 90 minutes in duration. All interviews were conducted either in Arabic, English, Somali, or Tigrinya. The interviews were conducted in the participants’ own languages (one interviewer was fluent in Arabic and another in Tigrinya), and a Somali interpreter was used when needed. 25 interviews were conducted in English and the remaining 17 were conducted in the other languages. The re- searchers took notes and audio-recorded during the interviews then subsequently translated and fully transcribed the interviews in English on an encrypted laptop. All interviews were translated into English to produce written transcripts.\n2.5. Qualitative data analysis\nWe employed Joffe and Yardley's qualitative research guidelines for our thematic analysis (Joffe and Yardley, 2004). Two researchers open- coded the transcripts of the interviews using thematic analysis to identify major underlying themes. The two researchers initially read through a sample of interviews separately and independently drafted a list of recurrent codes derived from the data (inductive coding). All coding was done using MAXQDA 11. Codes were identified in- dependently then refined collaboratively to ensure good inter-coder reliability. The coders discussed discrepancies between their codes until they reached consensus, then finalized a list of reoccurring themes based on the frequency with which each code was identified throughout the interviews. The nuances of these high-frequency codes were then explored. Key themes and illustrative quotations were reviewed by the researchers for consensus.\n3. Results\n3.1. Demographics\nDemographic characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. Of 42 participants interviewed, 20 were women and 22 men ranging in age from 18 to 70 years, with an average age of 39. Twenty- four of the 42 (57.1%) participants were Muslim and the remaining 18 were Christian (42.9%). Fifteen participants were immigrants from Somalia (35.7%), 14 from Eritrea (33.3%), 3 from Ethiopia (7.1%), with the remaining participants coming from Sudan, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Egypt, and the Arab Gulf. The vast majority of participants were married (38/42, 90.5%) and had at least a high school education (40/ 42, 95.2%). 13 out of the 22 men (59.1%) interviewed had post-\nTable 1\nParticipant characteristics.

Half of the participants had lived in the US for more than 10 years (21/42, 50.0%), a quarter had lived in the US for 5–10 years (11/42, 26.2%), and the remaining quarter for less than 5 years (10/42, 23.8%), with the breakdown being similar among men and women. The range of years living in the US spanned anywhere from 3 months to 44 years.\n3.2. Perceptions of FGC\n3.2.1. Rationales for the practice\nA primary aim of this study was to explore how immigrant women who have undergone FGC and immigrant men conceive of the practice. Participants cited a range of rationales for the creation and perpetua- tion of FGC. In response to the question “Why do you think the practice is performed?,” all 42 participants agreed with the response “preserve chastity,” 24 participants agreed with “culture,” 14 participants agreed with “religion,” 6 participants agreed with “ensure marriage,” 3 parti- cipants agreed with “rite of passage,” 2 participants agreed with “curb sexual desire,” one participant agreed with “enhance sexual pleasure for men,” and 1 participant agreed with “hygiene.” Virtually all parti- cipants considered FGC a primarily cultural rather than religious practice, and some argued that the two—religion and culture—are not distinct categories, as they readily intersect in daily life.\nIn contrast to meta-narratives of FGC as a means to “preserve chastity,” a 68-year-old Eritrean man and a 65-year-old Ethiopian man described how some Eritreans and Ethiopians decide to have their daughters undergo Type III FGC in order to protect them from being raped. A 64-year-old Nigerian man explained that, in his community of origin, people believed that FGC was necessary to reduce the chances of a woman experiencing stillbirth. Lastly, a 42-year-old Malian man de- scribed FGC as both a physical and spiritual ritual of initiation into womanhood.\n3.2.2. Perceived effects of the practice\nMany participants believed that there were no advantages to FGC,\noften explaining that it does more harm than good. A 30-year-old Egyptian woman used strong, human rights-based language in her re- sponse:\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nIt disfigures her body, it harms her emotionally, and it gives her no [sexual] feelings ... This is because sex, as it relates to women in our society, is something rejected. She does not have a right in it...The location for pleasurable feelings, the clitoris, is taken. It makes the woman void of pleasurable feelings. This is a crime.\nIn contrast, other female participants argued that, despite having undergone FGC, they were able to experience sexual pleasure. A 54- year-old Eritrean woman said, “I am not aware of any physical dis- abilities or unwanted consequences or what is called ‘reduced pleasure’ in sex that has to do with clitoris removal...I have no problem in terms of enjoying sex. I don't see my disadvantage.”\nAnother participant, a 21-year-old Ethiopian man, argued that the social acceptability of FGC is specific to its context:\nIt's not just about the person, and the practice of the religion, but it's more about what people in the community think. It [FGC] has a huge social implication that can be negative for people who aren't in that community. But for the people who are in it and who have lived through it, it can be socially beneficial.\nFor one 35-year-old Eritrean woman, for example, having under- gone FGC forms a barrier to social acceptance in Boston, particularly in healthcare settings, as she must face the stigma of FGC as ‘backward’ and ‘primitive.’ Thus, having experienced FGC can serve as both a means of gaining social acceptability and of being socially ostracized, depending on the local power dynamics.\n3.3. Gendered dynamics of FGC: exploring the roles of men\nIn discussions with both women and men about the roles of men in the dynamics of FGC, two primary sub-themes emerged: notions of marriageability in relation to men's preferences and the potential for men to act as advocates against FGC in their families and communities.\n3.3.1. Marriageability and men's preferences\nSome participants argued that at the center of discourses on FGC, marriageability, and men's preferences lies the importance of virginity in the construction of the ‘good,’ ‘desirable’ woman. A 30-year-old Somali woman explained that, in the context of exploring marriage options, discussions around having undergone FGC often serve as a means of discussing virginity, an important quality to her in the larger sociopolitical context of marriage and desirability.\nIn contrast, other participants argued that men desired a woman who had not undergone FGC and therefore had supposedly stronger sexual desires. A 65-year-old Ethiopian man described men's pre- ferences and the stigma against circumcised women in certain parts of Ethiopia: “In some areas, men prefer uncircumcised women [...] Because they think that if she's circumcised, that she's ‘resa’, like a dead body without sexual feeling.” Similarly, one 40-year-old Sudanese man discussed the importance of enjoying sex with his wife, who had un- dergone FGC and was not re-infibulated after giving birth to her first child:\nThey [young men] say that the woman who isn't circumcised is more happy, more heated—she will have more enjoyment with him. So I don't know. [...] They say that when she is circumcised she will not be hot, not be sexy, but I don't feel that. In my experience, I've had a happy and fulfilling life with my wife and we have enjoyment. [...] Even when she had our first son, my friends would say, \"Let her go back to Sudan and get re-circumcised\", but I said, “No. Why?”\nThus, we found a range of men's preferences with respect to FGC and indications that some preferences had changed over time.\n3.3.2. Men as advocates for change\nThe majority of participants, both women and men, highlighted the changing perspectives of men and their potential to serve as advocates\nagainst FGC, especially through their dual roles as family and com- munity members. Both men and women discussed the intimate roles of men as supportive husbands. A 40-year-old Sudanese Muslim man de- scribes his first sexual experience with his wife after they were married:\nWhen we went on our honeymoon, I told her I'm not gonna push her. She took one and a half months with me. [...] In the stories I had heard and the books I read, it [painful sex] can make the woman hate the man. I didn't want her to resent me so I said take it easy and slowly. It took us about 2 months and we were both satisfied.\nBoth male and female immigrants to Boston described how, as hus- bands, the men facilitated their wives' access to healthcare providers at the African Women's Health Center after having negative experiences with physicians with limited awareness of the practice of FGC.\nA 32-year-old Somali man described his stance as the father of a young girl:\nAs a man, it's just a theory. I'm not sure what it [FGC] is. You will never know or understand things unless it happens to you and it's personal. I've heard it's an awful thing...Would I do it to my daughter? No. I have a daughter and it's not part of my agenda and it's not part of anything anyone can convince me to do.\nSimilarly, a 40-year-old Sudanese man spoke of the responsibility of fathers to stop the practice: “I think the role of men is important, especially for fathers. If you're the father and you know this is about to happen to your daughter, ask yourself: why is this happening? And if you don't believe in it, then stop it from happening.” A 32-year-old Eritrean man described his changing position and his role in persuading his mother to prevent his youngest sister from undergoing FGC. Thus, many male participants viewed their roles as fathers and siblings, among others, as critical in FGC-related decision-making regarding the women and girls in their families.\nFurthermore, some participants argued that men, given their dominant position within the hegemonic social order, bear a particular responsibility to advocate against the practice—alongside their part- ners—at both the family and community levels. A 33-year-old Ethiopian man highlighted men's roles as advocates against FGC, ar- guing that their privileged status strongly implicates them in the practice:\nThe involvement of men in the fight against FGC is absolutely im- portant, because of their positions of power. If they are convinced, they can change [other people's] positions. So given the structural relations, I think their involvement is absolutely important. Because, for example, in a particular family if the husband says no, I don't think the practice will continue.\nWhile these participants stressed the roles of men in changing discourse around and practices of FGC, others also highlighted the roles of women. A 30-year-old Somali woman, for instance, explained that de- spite her and her husband's opposition to the practice, two out of five of her daughters underwent FGC because of her mother-in-law's pre- ferences.\n3.4. Religion\n3.4.1. Muslims and Christians\nReligion played an important role in our interviews with both Muslim and Christian participants. The central question for both Christians and Muslims was whether FGC was mandated, condoned, or forbidden by their respective religions. When asked about whether participants felt that FGC was a religious practice, some participants made reference to their primary texts, with some believing that FGC is specifically mentioned in the Bible or the Quran, and others believing that it was not. A 62-year-old Eritrean Christian man commented, “I think that both Christians and Muslims exercise that [FGC]. What I know is that most of them exercise it for cultural reasons.” Many\n334\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nparticipants believed that FGC was unrelated to their religion and was instead a reflection of cultural tradition. One participant, a 65-year-old Eritrean man, remarked, “In religious practice in the Orthodox Church, the priests never spoke about it being done, but I also never heard them condemning it. To me, it comes more from the civilian culture in Eritrea and Ethiopia, especially on the Christian side.” A 35-year-old Eritrean man commented, “I've read a little bit about it in the Bible. The Bible doesn't say anything about a girl being circumcised, only about boys. In our society, especially among the older ones, they mix the culture and religion.” A 43-year-old Somali Muslim man similarly explained, “There is nothing in our religion, nothing that says we should circumcise. It is not in religion or anything.” However, despite controversy over its re- ligious legitimacy, there seemed to be agreement among participants that FGC is practiced by both religious groups, although some Christian participants believed it to be more strictly practiced by Muslims.\n3.4.2. Sunna\nIn discussion with Muslim participants, the question of the practice's religious basis took on an additional dimension in the discourse around the different types of FGC, namely sunna versus the pharaonic type (Type 3). Although the term sunna can be used to describe non-in- fibulating forms of FGC, our population generally used it to refer to Type I FGC. A 26-year-old Somali woman explained, “There are two kinds of practice, one is sunna, set up by the holy Quran and the Prophet Muhammad, and the other is pharaonic, which is totally wrong. That's the one I'm against.” Around a fourth of participants (11/42, 26.2%) shared this view: that Type 3 was unacceptable due to its deleterious effects on women's health and sexuality, but that Type 1 might be ac- ceptable because it is a comparatively minor procedure without any perceived long-term effects. A few participants even mentioned that a common strategy used by some transnational campaigns and religious groups in their countries of origin to discourage severe forms of FGC was to encourage Type I over Type III FGC.\n3.4.3. Religion as a means for change\nMany participants referred to religious leadership as an important factor in swaying public and personal opinion against FGC. A 33-year- old Somali Muslim woman spoke about these dynamics in Somalia: “The situation has changed [...] a lot of sheikhs [Muslim religious scholars] came and spoke out and said how dangerous it is for the girls to be harmed. So they stopped. Very soon, they might even stop the sunna”. A 52-year-old Somali Muslim man said, “Some people still do the procedure, but it's not that popular. I hear that people spoke against the procedure. They said it's torture, if you do this to your daughter, you'll have to answer in the Hereafter, so it's not as popular as befor- e—the religious scholars speak out against it.” Many participants echoed the view that religious leaders play a critical role in influencing public opinions by denouncing the practice. In fact, many participants felt that it was much easier for them to abandon and discourage the practice themselves if they believed it was not religiously mandated. As a 40-year-old Somali Muslim woman recounted:\nWhere I grew up when I was young, they do it. [...] Our parents were not educated, they don't know what it is, they think this is a part of religion, it's like cultural things. But the good news is that after we flee the country, and got educated and found out more that it has nothing to do with our religion, it is very bad, it is not a sunna [Prophetic tradition], no hadith [Prophetic saying], or aya [Quranic verse], so now our people who left the country they don't do it, but those who still in the country they do it. That's why we try to educate each other. Like if you have a sister, and she has daughter we say don't do it, we have kids now, we don't do it. Like, for ex- ample, I have four children born in America so I don't do it because we follow the practice of our religion, and our religion did not say do it at all, so this thing is just cultural, it has nothing to do with our religion.\nMany participants shared similar experiences in which the act of emi- gration itself allowed for a reframing of the relationship between re- ligion and perceptions of FGC, making it easier for them to abandon the practice. A few Muslim participants even noted that immigrating to the United States and meeting Muslims who had emigrated from commu- nities where FGC is not practiced further persuaded them that FGC was not a mandated Islamic practice.\n3.5. Changes in perspectives on and practices of FGC\nThe final theme of our interviews was the potential for change in opinions on FGC, both in immigrants’ communities of origin as well as in the US. The overwhelming majority of participants we interviewed, both men and women, believed that both the prevalence of and popular support for FGC had decreased. Participants attributed this decline to both personal and community-level changes relating to (from most to least commonly attributed) education, urban-rural divides, crim- inalization of FGC, generational differences, emigration, transnational and national campaigns, religious leaders, and medical personnel.\n3.5.1. Sources of change\nThese changes in opinions on FGC were overwhelmingly attributed to increased education, particularly regarding the harms and health risks of FGC. A 31-year-old Somali woman explained succinctly, “There is a faction that says it [FGC] is something necessary to our culture, and there are some people who see it as a backwards practice. The differ- ence between these people are their education levels.” Differences in education were also often linked to generational differences. One 42- year-old Sudanese woman noted, “This [FGC] used to be widespread during the time of our mothers and the generations past but now that people are aware and they know that the circumcision has a lot of complications and that it is not right, people have begun to distance themselves from it.” A 33-year-old Somali woman affirmed, “People now have a lot of education; people my age don't agree with the practice, but people in older generations still support it. But now young people know the risks.”\nIn addition to education, the criminalization of FGC in their coun- tries of origin was cited by participants as a significant factor in the perceived decline in the prevalence of FGC. However, many partici- pants noted that criminalization was not enough. A 55-year-old Eritrean man noted:\nThe government in Eritrea declared a proclamation so that by the law the practice gets punished. Whether people accept the law is a different question. To convince people, you have to do civil educa- tion and education through religious institutions and you have to do different efforts. Just because you have a law, it doesn't mean you will see many changes. [...] There is still much more work that needs to be done. Because with religion and culture, [...] it is dif- ficult and troublesome to change people's perspectives.\nThus, participants stressed the importance of education and advocacy in changing public opinion and the practice of FGC. A 25-year-old Ghanaian Christian man recalled, “For a while growing up, there was a lot of education against it [FGC]. So most communities have done away with it. But unfortunately in some communities it still persists. [...] The good thing was that most people got on board, presidents made public declarations, chief imams [Muslim religious leaders] were some of the biggest people who spoke up against it.”\nMany participants had memories of various media outlets such as TV campaigns, documentaries, and news articles that helped them change their own views on the negative effects of FGC. A 28-year-old Somali woman said that she thought that the prevalence of FGC, especially of Type III, had decreased in Somalia, “because everybody is talking about the health problems like infection, bad periods, problems with peeing. They make community organizations, women tell the men and the moms and tell them to stop the pharaonic type. It's the doctors\n335\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nand gynecologists and midwives who are the ones encouraging this. And this is making changes.” Thus, most participants expressed the opinion that the popularity and prevalence of FGC (especially Type III) had decreased over time in their communities of origin due to a com- bination of factors including education, national campaigns, media, and the efforts of religious leaders, politicians, and medical personnel. They identified the barriers to change as limited education, difficulty in reaching and influencing rural populations, and resistance, especially from older generations, to abandoning this longstanding practice.\n3.5.2. Change through immigration\nAll of the men and women we interviewed were immigrants from communities where FGC is practiced, and many identified immigration itself as an important factor in changing both their personal views on FGC and the views of their immigrant communities in the US. A 68- year-old Eritrean man said, “I think that as we come here to the US and we learn more about the practice, we learn that we should not demand for our daughters or our sisters to be circumcised. We don't even think about it or consider it.” A 33-year-old Somali woman made a similar point:\nWhen you're far away from your country, you view things you used to do differently—what's good, what's beneficial. People had lack of education, they don't even have a good religious education but now it's expanded, [...] now when they know the religion isn't acceptable for this, many people gave it up. [...] People couldn't tell the dif- ference without education between culture versus religion.\nWe specifically examined the views of the 10 more recent immigrants (defined as living in the US for 5 years or less) interviewed in our study and found that, regardless of age, they did not tend to have more tra- ditional views than more established immigrants and that, in fact, they all shared a negative perception of the practice of FGC.\n3.5.3. Vacation cutting\nParticipants were asked about the practice of “vacation cutting,” in which immigrants take their daughters back to their countries of origin to have them undergo FGC. Most participants had heard of the practice in the media but did not personally know anyone who had done it, and some participants doubted that the practice was possible at all. As one participant put it, “Because of the rules in America, a doctor could complain or take the kids away [if they underwent FGC]. People don't take their daughters overseas [for the purpose of FGC] because they know they'll get checked by a doctor when they come back. It's a risk if they come back here.”\n3.6. Role of the diaspora\n3.6.1. Potential influence of the diaspora\nWe asked participants about the ways in which they felt they could\ninfluence views and practices in their communities of origin. A few participants believed that they play a strong role in deterring family and friends in their communities of origin from practicing FGC. A 52- year-old Sudanese Muslim man related, “Whenever one of them has a newborn girl, I tell them ‘Don't listen to your friend, or neighbor or someone else that'll tell you to do this [circumcise your daughter] be- cause you may end up losing your child’. And yes, they listen to me.” A 65-year-old Eritrean man described current community efforts to change perceptions in his home country:\nThe change starts with people who live in the US and so forth. So yeah, I think people who live in other countries can influence people back home and make a difference. Actually, I know an Ethiopian woman who used to live in California and now she tries to educate women back home about these issues. In general, it's health edu- cation. The discussion is not only about circumcision, it's also about women's health.\nMany participants felt they had not yet influenced their relatives, but that they could eventually have an impact on them. A 45-year-old Ethiopian Christian man stated, “If I get the chance, of course I would talk about it [FGC]. [...] It's not only for talk, but also it's my respon- sibility as a medical doctor. I have to teach my communities and my people in my country about how bad it is, and how they can avoid it.”\n3.6.2. Challenges to the influence of the diaspora\nA few participants identified several obstacles to effecting change as\nmembers of the diaspora. The most common was that their relatives and friends in their countries of origin simply might not be receptive to advice condemning the practice of FGC, especially those in older gen- erations. Some participants pointed out that this might be particularly true if their advice was perceived as coming from a “foreign” per- spective. When asked about whether members of the diaspora could be effective in influencing opinions back home, a 62-year-old Eritrean man said:\nWell, the answer is yes and no. No, because I am in the diaspora. Whatever I say to them, they think that I am representing a foreign culture. So I don't think I will be able to convince them. Yes, because you know it all depends on how I try to convince them. If I think that this is a critical issue, if I am able to present my facts and figures to them properly, I might convince some people. [...] If I am equipped with the appropriate tools, then I might be able to convince them. [...] But [...] they see the cultural difference, and they think that this is a Western and American idea. They might think that I just want to be like the Americans, and I could not convince them.\nA few participants expressed that members of the diaspora may not be the best suited to effect change because of their lack of direct ex- perience with FGC compared to those living in communities where it is practiced. A 20-year-old Somali Muslim woman noted that FGC had only come up once since she moved to the US:\nI go to school here where they teach Quran. One time they brought up the topic [of FGC]. Most of the girls were born here so they said in class that it doesn't exist, that it was old. It was a positive thing that it’s not done anymore to them but naïve of them to think it's exaggerated and doesn't happen anywhere. My family was all cir- cumcised.\nA 54-year-old Eritrean woman expressed similar ideas:\nThe women from rural areas in Eritrea are the most smart, and the ones that are here in the diaspora don't have a third of the knowl- edge that the women in the rural areas do. [...] I don't know whe- ther women in the diaspora are more aware than women back home, and if they're the ones to make an impact on the society as a whole. I think people in the diaspora have a lot to learn, and people in Eritrea are more advanced with their ideas. Of course the women's centers in Eritrea are set up with financial support from the diaspora, with their learning centers and things like that.\nOverall, many participants saw potential for the diaspora to influence opinions on the practice of FGC in their communities of origin, but some identified clear obstacles to the success of these efforts, and others highlighted impactful campaigns against the practice within their communities of origin.\n4. Discussion\nOur study sheds light on the views and experiences of immigrant men and women in Boston, Massachusetts originating from a variety of communities where FGC is practiced. Participants expressed a range of rationales for the practice of FGC, and many questioned the validity of these rationales and the continuation of the practice, especially in its most severe forms. Notably, this is among the few studies in which men of the diaspora in the United States have been interviewed on the topic\n336\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nof FGC. Most male participants strongly opposed the practice due to its effects on their wives' sexual and childbirth experiences. Religion seemed to play a role in participants’ views, both for and against the practice. Participants also cited immigration and education as having significant effects on the changing views regarding the continuation of the practice. Furthermore, many participants considered themselves capable of playing an important role in influencing the discourse around the practice of FGC in their home communities.\nBoth the Christians and Muslims in our study cited religion as an important factor in both the continuation and curbing of the practice of FGC. While the Quran does not mention FGC, and it is not practiced in most Muslim-majority countries, many Muslim participants said they grew up with the understanding that Islam mandated the practice. Nevertheless, our participants also cited religion, religious leaders, and religious institutions as instrumental in shaping their own views and views in their home communities against FGC. In Johnsdotter's study of Somali women living in Sweden, participants were especially opposed to pharaonic circumcision, as they had developed the belief that it was contrary to basic Islamic principles (Johnsdotter, 2003). Many of our participants admitted that they would not have been able to abandon the practice had they not learned through education, and in many cases immigration, that FGC was not religiously compulsory. Thus, the campaigns of religious leaders and institutions against FGC seem to play a critical role in influencing community perspectives on FGC.\nThe term sunna, meaning “according to the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad”, was generally used by our participants to refer to Type I FGC, but can be used to describe any non-infibulating form of FGC, considered ‘less severe’ than Type III. In some countries such as Somalia, Type I FGC has been harder to eradicate than Type III, termedpharaonic, as the latter carries a non-Islamic name that people seem more ready to question (The World Bank, 2004; Gele et al., 2012). In a few prior studies, including one in Somalia and another among Somali refugees in the US, some women expressed a preference for Type I FGC, seeing it as a safe alternative to Type III for both health and religious reasons (Fried et al., 2013; McNeely and Jong, 2016; Connor et al., 2016). While the Somali women in Fried's study had received unequi- vocal messages from the campaigns of religious leaders and institutions that the practice of Type III FGC was un-Islamic and so had started opposing it, many had received conflicting messages regarding Type I FGC, hearing that it was either prohibited, a religious mandate, or optional (Fried et al., 2013). These mixed messages are reflected in our own study population of men and women living in the US, who were overwhelmingly against the practice of FGC, especially Type III, with some participants having more equivocal views on Type I.\nThe men in our study collectively took a stand against FGC, espe- cially due to its impact on their wives' health and sexual lives and concern that their daughters might suffer the same. In a study of West African immigrants in New York City, men were found to be as knowledgeable about the health consequences of FGC as women, though with a less nuanced understanding, and were just as likely as women to reject the practice (Akinsulure-Smith and Chu, 2017). An- other study exploring Gambian men's knowledge found that only a minority of men were aware of FGC health consequences, but those who understood its negative impact on the health and well-being of girls and women were very willing to play a role in its prevention (Kaplan et al., 2013). A systematic review of twenty studies on the role of men in abandonment of FGC found that education level was one of the most important indicators for men's support for abandonment of the practice (Varol et al., 2015). Both social obligation and a lack of dia- logue between men and women on the issue were identified as barriers to abandonment.\nIn one study, men in a Somali community in the US expressed that they play key roles in explaining their own socio-cultural contexts to American healthcare providers and as advocates for their wives in a foreign healthcare system (Johnson-Agbakwu et al., 2014). Similarly, several men in our own study facilitated their wives' access to\nhealthcare providers at the African Women's Health Center after having negative experiences with physicians with limited awareness of the practice of FGC. Both the men and women in our study discussed the intimate roles of men as supportive husbands, both sexually and emo- tionally, particularly at the time of their wives' first sexual experiences, which many participants described as painful. Most profoundly, many male participants explored their current and potential roles as ad- vocates against the practice of FGC. While they admitted that they had generally thought of the practice as a “women's issue,” many had begun to feel that men could play a vital role in curbing the practice in their communities. The men we interviewed believed that they had a parti- cular duty to raise awareness in their families and their communities about the physical and emotional harm FGC can cause and spoke of their roles in dissuading their family and community members from continuing the practice.\nIn our study, the perceived role of immigration in influencing par- ticipants’ views against FGC cannot be ignored. Many Muslim partici- pants explained that, due to exposure to Muslims immigrating from countries where FGC was not practiced, immigrants felt more ready to question and ultimately dismiss the perceived religious origins of the practice. In this way, immigration seems to provide a space where people of different diasporic communities interact and exchange ideas, a phenomenon supported by prior studies (McNeely and Jong, 2016; Berggren et al., 2006). According to the “modified stages of change” theory, Shell-Duncan proposes that people abandon the practice of FGC when they find a motivation to do so and when their social context supports, promotes, or at least accepts abandonment, such as in the setting of immigration (Shell-Duncan and Herniund, 2006). A study examining the temporal effect of immigration on attitudes towards FGC found that immigration to Britain from a younger age appeared to be associated with abandonment of FGC and changes in the more tradi- tional beliefs that underpin it (Morison et al., 2004). While we did not demonstrate the same findings as recent immigrants also shared nega- tive views of FGC, our sample size is also small and unlikely to be able to demonstrate such a difference. One theory relevant to this could be the migration selection hypothesis, which posits that those who migrate tend to be wealthier, educated and from urban settings, factors known to be associated with reduced support for FGC (Ortensi et al., 2015). However, our study population had a large proportion of refugees and asylum seekers and did not represent a disproportionately wealthy group.\nOne framework to understand the abandonment of FGC is the social convention theory of interdependent decision-making. As Mackie and LeJeune describe, FGC is a community practice that traditionally fa- cilitated social belonging and marriageability (Mackie and LeJeune, 2009). Therefore, ending the practice cannot only be an individual endeavor, but requires the entire community, starting with a critical mass of its most influential members, to collectively and publicly abandon it. Remarkably, as the authors emphasize, “The underlying moral norm of care for one's children, which motivates the decision to practice FGM/C can also inspire communities to reconsider the prac- tice” (Mackie and LeJeune, 2009, page 2).\nAs all our participants were aware of US laws outlawing FGC, we asked them specifically about the illegal practice commonly known as “vacation cutting,” in which immigrants are said to attempt to sustain the practice of FGC by returning to their countries of origin with their daughters for the purpose of having them undergo FGC (Goldberg et al., 2016). Based on our qualitative data, immigrants from multiple coun- tries of origin had heard of the practice but did not know of any such cases in their families or communities and found it hard to believe that it was possible, particularly given the legal consequences. There are no reliable sources of data on the prevalence of this practice in the United States (Nour, 2015; Goldberg et al., 2016). New laws are being pro- posed in the US to target these communities to address this practice; however, caution will have to be exercised in the enforcement of these laws so as to avoid racial profiling, especially as the practice has not\n337\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nbeen confirmed to be widespread in the US. As Johnsdotter et al. write in their qualitative study that found firm rejection of all forms of FGC among Ethiopian and Eritrean immigrants in Sweden, “A societal structure prepared to deal with suspected cases of FGC with a high level of alertness should be combined with a healthy skeptical attitude to- ward exaggerations of risk estimates” (Johnsdotter et al., 2007, page 114).\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically explore the current and potential roles of diasporic communities in engaging with the perceptions and practices of FGC in their communities of origin. Participants' responses were mixed; many believed that they already had some influence in dissuading their family and friends from having FGC performed on their daughters. Others had not considered it pre- viously, but affirmed that their participation in this study would inspire them to call their relatives in their countries of origin to discuss the practice. Mackie's social norms theory is interesting to consider in this context: are members of the diaspora influential enough to impact perception and practice in their countries of origin (Mackie and LeJeune, 2009)? More research is required to investigate this question. Based on our findings, research and initiatives that target FGC should incorporate the exchange of ideas and experiences between immigrant communities and their communities of origin, while paying attention to local efforts in communities where FGC is currently practiced.\n4.1. Implications and future directions\nOur study has several implications. Our participants describe per- sonal and communal change that they attribute to multiple factors in- cluding education, immigration, changing social pressures, and im- proved religious literacy, all of which can be used to promote and support change in practice. Our study also highlights a need for more targeted involvement of already motivated male members of the com- munity in the effort to curb the practice of FGC. Our preliminary ex- ploration of the role of members of the diaspora provides some support for initiatives that would involve emigrants in the effort to curb the practice in home countries. Further research should be conducted to study the efficacy of this approach. Although our study is limited geo- graphically to Boston, Massachusetts, our findings do not support the fear that vacation cutting might be common among US immigrants. We should therefore exercise caution in our promotion of legislation and clinical practices that target this fear.\n4.2. Limitations\nThis study is subject to several limitations. While participants were forthcoming with personal information, the topic of FGC can be sensi- tive not only emotionally, but also legally; it is possible that due to the heavy bias and strict laws in the United States against FGC, participants who looked upon the practice more favorably might have been less forthcoming about topics like vacation cutting or their personal or community views on the topic. Our participants are not intended as a representative sample of the immigrant population in the US, and it is entirely possible that the views of our participants, who presented to the African Women's Health Center or other community centers where they were recruited, might differ from the views of other members of their communities. Additionally, those willing to discuss FGC in a study may represent different attitudes than those who would not choose to participate. Finally, in addition to being a benefit, focusing on im- migrants from multiple countries in our study may mask trends and themes that might be more specific to a specific community or country.\n5. Conclusion\nUnlike previous studies that focused on only one community/ country of origin, this study documents the perceptions and experiences of immigrant men and women in Boston, Massachusetts, from a wide\nvariety of communities where FGC is practiced. Many participants questioned the rationales behind FGC in their own lives and felt strongly against the continuation of the practice of FGC. This change in opinion, described by our participants as taking place on both the personal and community levels, was most frequently attributed to education and immigration. Our study provides strong support for the inclusion of men, religious leaders, and immigrants in FGC-related ef- forts. Changing views in the diaspora could play a significant role in affecting opinions and practices in contexts where FGC is prevalent. Finally, none of the participants personally knew of anyone who per- formed vacation cutting, calling into question the concern that vacation cutting might be common among US immigrants. We should therefore exercise caution in our promotion of legislation and clinical practices that target this fear.\nDeclarations of interest\nNone.",

      "content": "The author's writing style across the provided samples exhibits a range of characteristics that point to a thoughtful, informed, and reflective voice, adept at navigating complex, multidimensional topics. Here’s a breakdown of the writing style based on tone, voice, and nuances:\n\n### 1. **Intellectual and Analytical Tone**\n   - The author often engages with topics that require a deep level of understanding and knowledge, such as post-traumatic growth, educational methodologies, and the impact of socio-political events. The writing is rich in terminology specific to the fields discussed (e.g., \"Character Strengths,\" \"Post Traumatic Growth Inventory\"), indicating a scholarly or professional level of discourse.\n\n### 2. **Reflective and Insightful**\n   - Reflection is a significant component of the author's style. They frequently explore personal experiences and broader social phenomena, extracting lessons or insights. This is evident in the way the author discusses the impact of learning about prompting in AI or the philosophical undertones in discussions about God and personal choices. This reflective quality adds depth and personalizes the content, making it relatable and introspective.\n\n### 3. **Empathetic and Humanistic**\n   - The author often writes with empathy, particularly when discussing human-centric topics such as trauma, learning, and community engagement. There is a consistent undertone of seeking to understand and articulate the human condition and experiences, often tying back to broader societal impacts or personal growth.\n\n### 4. **Narrative and Descriptive**\n   - The author uses narrative techniques to engage the reader, weaving stories and scenarios that illustrate larger points (e.g., the detailed narrative about the impact of traumatic events on social entrepreneurs). Descriptive language enriches these narratives, painting vivid pictures of scenarios or thought processes.\n\n### 5. **Formal Yet Accessible**\n   - While the vocabulary and concepts tend to be formal and academic, the author manages to maintain accessibility through clear explanations and the use of analogies. This balance helps in reaching readers who may not be familiar with the technical terminology but are interested in the topics discussed.\n\n### 6. **Culturally and Socially Aware**\n   - There is a strong element of social and cultural awareness in the author's writing. They frequently reference global contexts and the implications of cultural practices, showing an understanding of and respect for diversity in human experiences.\n\n### 7. **Persuasive and Motivational**\n   - In pieces aimed at advocating for certain practices or perspectives (such as the use of humor in educational settings for trauma survivors), the author adopts a persuasive tone. This is done not through overt calls to action but through reasoned arguments and the presentation of evidence, which subtly guides the reader to appreciate the author's viewpoint.\n\n### 8. **Complex Sentence Structures**\n   - The author's use of complex sentence structures and compound phrases suggests a sophisticated command of language. This style supports the delivery of complex ideas and allows the author to layer information in a dense, yet manageable, manner.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's style is marked by its intellectual rigor, reflective depth, and empathetic approach, all woven together with a narrative skill that engages and educates. This combination effectively bridges the gap between personal experiences and broader societal issues, making their writing both informative and deeply humanistic.",
