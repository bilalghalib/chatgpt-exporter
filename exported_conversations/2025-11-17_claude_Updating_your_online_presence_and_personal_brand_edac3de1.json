  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nBilal Ghalib, Co-Founder of Bloom and creator of the Cursive digital writing platform, sought coaching help to overhaul his outdated online presence and clarify his professional direction. Based in France, he's currently studying and needs new work contracts while navigating complex feelings about social media use during current global conflicts. His website BilalGhalib.com reflects an earlier version of himself from around 2017, featuring outdated projects and unmoderated comments that don't represent his current work with international organizations or his sophisticated curriculum development experience.\n\nThe conversation revealed Bilal's professional evolution from playful maker to development sector work to social impact consulting, shaped by transformative experiences that led to burnout and a shift toward more meaningful work. He described struggling with being overly critical of institutions and people, including himself, while trying to balance his naturally expressive personality with periods of withdrawal. His current interests span helping people grow and learn, creating physical products like essential oils and coffee, facilitating entrepreneur development calls through Bloom, and developing Cursive as a platform for authentic digital writing.\n\nClaude helped Bilal identify his core professional skill as creating \"containers\" - designing learning experiences and programs that work in complex, high-stakes environments from conflict zones to emerging markets. This encompasses his curriculum design work, program development with over 1000 entrepreneurs, facilitation and coaching abilities, and research synthesis skills. The conversation focused on translating this abstract concept into marketable language for potential clients including international organizations, foundations, impact investors, and educational institutions. Bilal expressed interest in potential funding for Cursive and mentioned knowing investors, leading to a discussion about whether he wants to build a venture-scale company or maintain a consulting practice while developing his platform as a craft project.",

      "content": "This is a really vulnerable, raw message from Bilal. He's wrestling with multiple interconnected tensions:\n\n1. His outdated online presence vs needing work/contracts\n2. His critical nature toward institutions (UN, etc.) and whether that's healthy\n3. Guilt/shame about social media during genocide/war\n4. Wanting to be authentic but not trusting himself or his motivations\n5. Tension between being a \"loud person with ideas\" and wanting to withdraw\n6. Pattern of starting things and abandoning them\n7. Deep question about self-admiration/worth\n\nHe's asking me to:\n- Look at his website\n- Act as coach/therapist/psychologist\n- Draw on our chat history\n- Ask profound questions\n- Help him do this sustainably\n- Reference people he admires (Derek Sivers, Seth Godin)\n\nFrom memory, I know:\n- He's Co-Founder of Bloom, works with UN/ITC on curriculum\n- Based in Lille, France, Iraqi-American\n- Father with young child\n- Developing Cursive (digital writing platform)\n- Recently finished UN work, exploring next career steps\n- Has financial uncertainty\n- Deep values around authentic connection, constructive criticism\n- Works on Islamic psychology, social entrepreneurship\n\nLet me start by looking at his website to understand what he's working with, then I can ask meaningful questions grounded in what I see vs what he's expressing now.\n\nI should NOT flatter him, should give constructive pushback, and use metaphors when helpful. I should be genuinely curious and help him untangle this, not just give surface advice.Let me look at your website first, then we'll dig into this together.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nOkay, wow. This is... not good. Let me be honest with myself about what I'm seeing:\n\n1. It's extremely outdated - references to old Twitter handles, old projects\n2. Very scattered - lists tons of co-founder roles without clear narrative\n3. The \"long\" section has emoji bullets and vague language (\"entire everything\")\n4. There are random unmoderated comments from years ago (including a 16-year-old looking for hacking workshops, someone pitching a book)\n5. The photo might be quite old\n6. No clear value proposition or story\n7. Lists projects that may no longer exist or be relevant\n\nBilal is right - this doesn't inspire trust for someone doing serious UN curriculum work or building sophisticated platforms like Cursive. It reads like a 2015-era maker/hacker profile, not a mature social entrepreneur and learning scientist.\n\nBut here's what I need to understand before giving advice:\n1. Why hasn't he updated it? Is it avoidance, perfectionism, not knowing what to say?\n2. What's the real tension - is it about the website or about his relationship with being visible?\n3. The genocide/war guilt - this is serious and needs to be addressed directly\n4. His self-criticism and \"thinking everyone is stupid\" - this sounds like a defense mechanism\n5. The pattern of abandoning things - what's that about?\n\nI should ask questions that help him see the pattern, not just fix the website. The website is a symptom.\n\nLet me be direct and use a metaphor about what I'm seeing.Okay, I've looked at it. Let me be straight with you: your website is like a house where someone moved out in 2017 but forgot to forward their mail. There are old comments sitting there like junk mail piling up, Twitter handles that might not even exist anymore, and a photo that may or may not be you now. It's not that it's *bad* - it's that it's frozen in time, and you've clearly moved on.\n\nBut before we talk about fixing it, I want to ask you something more fundamental:\n\n**When you say \"I don't know if I admire myself\" - what would have to be true for you to admire yourself?**\n\nBecause here's what I'm seeing: You've built Bloom, supported 1,000+ entrepreneurs across 16 countries, developed sophisticated curriculum for the UN in active conflict zones, you're creating Cursive which is genuinely thoughtful work, you're a father navigating cross-cultural life in France while staying connected to Iraqi heritage. That's not nothing.\n\nBut you're telling me:\n- You think everyone is stupid\n- You feel ashamed to use social media during genocide\n- You start things and abandon them\n- You're overly critical\n- You don't trust people\n\n**So here's my first real question: Is the problem that you don't have achievements worth sharing, or that you can't figure out what the achievement *means* - like, what story it tells about who you are and what you value?**\n\nBecause \"I helped 1000 entrepreneurs\" is an achievement. But if you can't connect it to a deeper purpose or narrative, it just feels like a bullet point on someone else's LinkedIn.\n\nThe Derek Sivers types you admire - they're not just sharing what they *did*. They're sharing their *thinking*. The process. The contradictions. The questions.\n\nWhat would happen if you treated your online presence not as a resume, but as your way of thinking out loud about the tensions you're actually living with?",

So am I!\n🔧 I think the thing I’m proudest about supporting is helping inspire a community of makers in the MENA region and in various countries, sometimes in various complex environments, to work together to improve skills, build entrepreneurship and innovation opportunities, and most importantly to build hope. This was part of my effort under the GEMSI (Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative) effort I ran across the MENA region for several years.\n🌼 Bloom (ex “Pitchworthy”) is the next evolution of that, as we work to leverage technology to make sure the “waters of opportunity” flow to anywhere there is a seed of potential. We connect mentors, community and funds, through learning experiences to improve opportunities, education, support, and communities of makers and problem-solvers around the region.\n4 thoughts on “About”\nHello,\nMy name is Christine and Natheer gave me your contact a week or so ago…\nIâ€˜ve just been overwhelmed by whatâ€™s happening in Beirut and just arrived there… (I live In Ireland)\nI am interested to know more about your initiative and database, didnâ€™t really get whatâ€™s all about.\nFew words about me: Iâ€™m a film editor, filmmaker and writer foremost.\nps: I texted you the same thing but you said physical letter, donâ€™t know where to post it 🙂 !\nhey man, What’s happened to Baghdad Community Hackerspace Workshops.\nI’d just want to know. am a 16 years old kid interesting in programming and hacking.\nDear Bilal,\nI came across you on the Alter Ego network website, then looked you up on Linkedin. Looking at your work activities and network of connections I thought my book might be of interest.\nThe book is called ‘The Age of Wellbeing’ and provides a narrative for building back better with a vision for a world where we can all thrive. It’s had great reviews and sold in the UK, USA, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand and the Netherlands so far. There is a free preview at https://bit.ly/ageofwellbeingfreepreview\nIf you’d like to know it would be great to talk with you.\nKind regards,\nDavid Green\nLots still going on, check out the 29 day challenge! https://t.me/challenge_29",

It's not that it's *bad* - it's that it's frozen in time, and you've clearly moved on.\n\nBut before we talk about fixing it, I want to ask you something more fundamental:\n\n**When you say \"I don't know if I admire myself\" - what would have to be true for you to admire yourself?**\n\nBecause here's what I'm seeing: You've built Bloom, supported 1,000+ entrepreneurs across 16 countries, developed sophisticated curriculum for the UN in active conflict zones, you're creating Cursive which is genuinely thoughtful work, you're a father navigating cross-cultural life in France while staying connected to Iraqi heritage. That's not nothing.\n\nBut you're telling me:\n- You think everyone is stupid\n- You feel ashamed to use social media during genocide\n- You start things and abandon them\n- You're overly critical\n- You don't trust people\n\n**So here's my first real question: Is the problem that you don't have achievements worth sharing, or that you can't figure out what the achievement *means* - like, what story it tells about who you are and what you value?**\n\nBecause \"I helped 1000 entrepreneurs\" is an achievement. But if you can't connect it to a deeper purpose or narrative, it just feels like a bullet point on someone else's LinkedIn.\n\nThe Derek Sivers types you admire - they're not just sharing what they *did*. They're sharing their *thinking*. The process. The contradictions. The questions.\n\nWhat would happen if you treated your online presence not as a resume, but as your way of thinking out loud about the tensions you're actually living with?",

That's the *same question* you've been asking your whole life, just with higher stakes now.\n\nHere's my more pointed question though:\n\n**You say you need work and contracts. What work do you ACTUALLY want? Not \"what would be acceptable\" or \"what would pay\" - but if you could design your next 3 years of work, what would it be?**\n\nBecause I suspect part of why you can't write your website is you're trying to appeal to everyone, which means you're appealing to a ghost version of yourself that doesn't exist anymore.",

      "content": "Okay, this is really rich. Let me think about what's happening here:\n\n1. He's listing a bunch of things he loves: seeing people grow, craft, perfumes, coffee products, coding, Cursive, helping people think, Bloom calls, bringing \"the human heart into the world\"\n\n2. There's this thread about the heart - Islamic psychology, connecting to something real beyond SDG stuff, distinguishing heart perception from emotions\n\n3. He mentions loving animals as a kid, wanting superpowers (Henry Sugar), and how technology offers a fake version but could connect to something real\n\n4. He's clearly scattered - \"I don't know what my craft is\" - but also there's a pattern here\n\nThe pattern I'm seeing: He loves *facilitation* and *making tools that help people access something deeper*. Whether it's Bloom calls, perfumes (which are sensory/experiential), Cursive (a tool for authentic writing), curriculum design (helping people learn), even the coffee - these are all about creating containers/tools/experiences that help people connect to something real.\n\nBut he's stuck because:\n- He thinks he needs to pick ONE thing\n- He's ashamed of not being \"serious enough\" during genocide\n- He doesn't trust himself or his playfulness anymore\n- He can't figure out how to market this mix\n- He's critical of everything including himself\n\nI think the real issue is he's trying to find his \"craft\" as a singular noun, when actually his craft is more like a verb - he *orchestrates experiences* that help people access depth/wisdom/heart/connection.\n\nBut I need to push back here because he's avoiding my question. I asked what work he WANTS for the next 3 years, and he gave me a beautiful meandering list of things he loves but didn't actually answer the question. That's a pattern - he can talk endlessly but won't commit to a direction.\n\nLet me push on this and also connect it back to the website issue.Hold on. You just gave me a gorgeous list of things you love, then asked if we're on the right track. But you didn't actually answer my question.\n\n**I asked: What work do you want for the next 3 years?**\n\nYou told me what you love *in general*. But that's like saying \"I love my kids and sunsets and good food\" when someone asks where you want to live. It's true, but it's not a decision.\n\nHere's what I'm hearing underneath all of this: You're terrified to commit to a direction because committing means saying \"this matters more than that\" - and you've spent years deconstructing the idea that anything matters, or that you can trust your own judgment about what matters.\n\nYou say \"I don't know what my craft is\" - but dude, look at what you just described:\n- Bloom calls where you help people think\n- Curriculum design that transforms how people learn  \n- Cursive as a tool for authentic connection\n- Even your perfumes and coffee - these are *containers* for experience\n\n**Your craft isn't a noun, it's a verb: You create containers that help people access something real.**\n\nWhether it's a workshop, a platform, a course, a product, or a conversation - you're always trying to make something that helps people connect to depth, to heart, to what's actually true.\n\nBut here's where I'm going to push back hard: **You can't have a website or a business or a sustainable practice if you won't commit to what you're actually doing for the next season of your life.**\n\nNot forever. Just the next 2-3 years. \n\nSo let me ask differently:\n\n**You're 38, you have a young child, you're in France, you need income, you're studying Islamic psychology. Given THOSE constraints - not in an ideal world, but in THIS world - what's the work you're willing to commit to for the next 2-3 years that would:**\n1. Pay your bills\n2. Use your actual skills \n3. Not make you feel like a fraud\n4. Leave room for Cursive and heart-work to develop on the side\n\nWhat is it?",
