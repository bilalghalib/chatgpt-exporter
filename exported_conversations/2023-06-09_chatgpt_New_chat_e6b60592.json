We work with centers, schools, clinics, and with parents at home. Use as a tool to learn more skills. With kids with learning difficulties they can use the tool at work. @littera.fun\nBiggest portion of sales is in schools (large channel, sell a lot in bulk) We’re focusing on this one because kids get into it and it can help us expand. Through social media we get parents/therapists. No sales through clinic. \nChallenge: Close up the deals. Working in Lebanese market mostly. Center in UAE finds us and call and buy. People in Lebanon go through different schools, crisis - schools debate if they will buy or not. Next three months schools need to make ordres now. We are making follow up calls. Didn’t close as many deals as we want.\nNumber of contacts: 30 schools\nNumber of deals: 5 closed. \nNumber of potential deals: 23\nNumber of schools said no: 2\n20th of June to close all deals. \nAll schools went over time with exams and are overwhelmed. \nChallenge is not related to product.

      "content": "Here are some potential solutions to the challenges you're facing:\n\n1. **Accelerate the Decision Process**: Provide a compelling reason for schools to make a decision quickly. You could potentially offer limited-time discounts or additional benefits if they commit by a certain deadline. \n\n2. **Improve Communication**: Clearly communicate the benefits of your product, how it will impact their students' learning, and why your product is unique. Additionally, try to find the best time and method of communication that works for your clients to ensure they receive and understand your message. \n\n3. **Design a Sales Funnel**: Properly organize the sales process with regular follow-ups. This will help you keep track of all potential clients and ensure no one falls through the cracks. \n\n4. **Provide Support and Training**: Offer to provide any necessary training or support to the educators that will be using your tool. This might encourage them to purchase more quickly if they feel supported. \n\n5. **Testimonials and Case Studies**: Provide examples of other schools or centers where your product has been successfully implemented and produced positive results. This can encourage potential buyers to make a purchase.\n\n6. **Referrals and Partnerships**: Try to form partnerships with institutions or organizations that your target schools trust. They can help endorse your product and increase its credibility.\n\n7. **Hire a Local Salesperson**: If possible, consider hiring a salesperson based in Lebanon who can meet with the schools in person and better navigate the local market.\n\n8. **Payment Plans**: If the schools are hesitant due to financial reasons, perhaps offering different payment plans or options would help them commit. \n\n9. **Digital Demonstration**: Considering the ongoing situation and the lack of physical meet-ups, a virtual demonstration or webinar might be an interesting way to present your product to a larger audience at once, while also answering questions in real-time. \n\n10. **Leverage Social Media**: Continue to leverage your social media presence, highlighting the benefits and unique aspects of your product, as well as sharing success stories from schools or parents who have used your product.\n\n11. **School Outreach Program**: Create an outreach program, perhaps with educational webinars or seminars related to learning Arabic or dealing with learning difficulties. This can create value and bring your company to the forefront.\n\nRemember that these strategies should be adjusted according to the specific cultural, economic, and social context of your target market.\n",

      "content": "While all the suggestions are practical from a general perspective, there could be cultural, economic, and logistic considerations specific to the Lebanese context. Here's a critique and selection of the methods most likely to be effective:\n\n1. **Accelerate the Decision Process**: Given the current economic situation in Lebanon, schools might not respond positively to pressure sales techniques. They might view them as coercive rather than beneficial. This approach should be used sparingly, or replaced with more supportive sales methods.\n\n2. **Improve Communication**: This is an excellent approach. Understanding cultural nuances and catering to the preferred communication style can help speed up decision-making. This technique is likely to work well in a Lebanese context.\n\n3. **Design a Sales Funnel**: Sales funnels work in any context as long as they are tailored to the audience. This could be particularly helpful in Lebanon, where interpersonal relationships and trust are crucial. Follow-ups demonstrate commitment and dedication to potential clients.\n\n4. **Provide Support and Training**: This is beneficial, especially if the training is provided in a culturally appropriate and relevant manner. Be prepared for potential logistic challenges due to Lebanon's current situation, such as power outages or limited internet access.\n\n5. **Testimonials and Case Studies**: Schools in Lebanon might respond well to evidence-based sales pitches. However, local case studies will likely be more effective than foreign examples, given the unique challenges Lebanese schools face.\n\n6. **Referrals and Partnerships**: Partnerships with local institutions and respected figures in Lebanon could be extremely effective, given the importance of trust and personal relationships in Lebanese culture.\n\n7. **Hire a Local Salesperson**: This could be particularly effective due to their familiarity with the language, culture, and current socio-economic climate. They would be able to navigate the market with a level of understanding that an external salesperson might lack.\n\n8. **Payment Plans**: Given the economic crisis in Lebanon, schools might appreciate flexible payment options. This could be a deciding factor for many institutions.\n\n9. **Digital Demonstration**: Due to the ongoing electricity crisis in Lebanon, arranging a time where all interested parties can be online at the same time might be challenging. It could work, but contingencies must be in place.\n\n10. **Leverage Social Media**: Although effective in many contexts, remember that Lebanon's internet access can be sporadic, and not all decision-makers might be active on these platforms. This should be used in conjunction with other strategies.\n\n11. **School Outreach Program**: In theory, this is a good idea, but given the political unrest and the COVID-19 situation in Lebanon, this might be logistically difficult. \n\nTherefore, based on the above critique, the most effective methods for your situation in Lebanon would likely be improving communication, designing a sales funnel, providing support and training, using local testimonials and case studies, hiring a local salesperson, offering flexible payment plans, and forming partnerships with local trusted institutions.",

Due to the COVID pandemic and online schooling, she was struggling with learning the Arabic letters in all their shapes.

This is when I decided to create a tool for every parent teacher or professional.``\n-Myra-\n \nMyra Obeid\nCo-Owner\nMyra has several years of experience in the field of education as a French teacher in different schools across Lebanon.

      "content": "From the given information, it appears that Littera's primary challenge is closing deals with schools for their language-learning products, particularly their Arabic teaching kit. Here are some strategies and methods tailored to their situation:\n\n1. **Leverage Co-Owners' Background**: Both co-owners, Myra and Myriam, have backgrounds in education and entrepreneurship. They can use their personal stories and credibility to create trust with potential customers. This strategy may be particularly effective in the Lebanese context, where interpersonal relationships are highly valued.\n\n2. **Online Training and Courses**: Capitalize on the company's current online training and courses, perhaps offering these services free or at a discount to schools that purchase the teaching kits. This could provide additional value and make the offer more attractive.\n\n3. **Personal Story**: Highlight the story of Myra's daughter, Rhea, as it shows a direct, personal solution to a problem many are facing. Testimonials from Rhea about how much she enjoyed learning Arabic using Littera's kits could be highly influential.\n\n4. **Networking**: Use the existing networks of the co-owners to reach out to potential customers. Given their backgrounds, they likely have contacts in the educational field who may either be potential customers or be able to provide referrals.\n\n5. **Partnership with Local Education Authorities**: Given the founders' backgrounds, they might have connections with local education departments or councils. Partnering with these bodies might give their product more credibility.\n\n6. **Community Engagement**: Participate in local events or sponsor activities that align with their brand, such as language festivals or educational fairs. This can raise the company's profile and get their product in front of potential customers.\n\n7. **Flexible Payment Options**: Given the economic situation in Lebanon, offering flexible payment plans could make the kits more accessible to schools and parents.\n\n8. **Showcase Success Stories**: Develop case studies showing the success of their product in teaching children Arabic. They could also gather testimonials from satisfied customers (parents, teachers, professionals) to build trust.\n\n9. **Highlight the Fun Aspect**: Many educational products focus solely on their academic benefits, so emphasizing the fun element in Littera's products could set them apart from competitors.\n\n10. **Product Demonstration**: Offer in-person or virtual demonstrations to schools, clinics, and parents. Seeing the product in action can often be more convincing than a simple sales pitch.\n\n11. **Referral Incentives**: Encourage existing happy customers to refer new ones by offering them some kind of incentive, such as a discount on future purchases.\n\nRemember that any approach needs to be sensitive to the economic, social, and cultural context of Lebanon to be most effective.",
