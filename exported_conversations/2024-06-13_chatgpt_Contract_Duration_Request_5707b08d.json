Here's a more professional version of your message:\n\n---\n\nSubject: Follow-Up on Contract Sequencing\n\nBonjour Nick, Hanaa, and Sandrine,\n\nI appreciate the update regarding the flexibility of the sequencing. Could you please confirm if there are any additional requirements from my end, or if we are still awaiting further information from HR?\n\nIf feasible and without introducing any additional delays, I would like to request a 22-week (5.5 months) contract. This timeframe aims to ensure project completion within the designated period, with the expectation that the actual duration will likely be around 4 months.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any further details needed or any updates.\n\nThank you,\n[Your Name]",
