What do you think of the slides and how can we improve them and the facilitator notes? YOUR GREEN\nBUSINESS IDEA\nThis chapter of the GBB complements the\nGenerate Your Business (GYB) manual in the\nSIYB family of products. The GYB manual\nwill help you to determine whether you have\nthe right characteristics to become an en-\ntrepreneur, to generate business ideas using\ndifferent sources, and to assess and pick the\nbest idea.\nThis chapter of the GBB helps you to do the\nabove from a green perspective. While this\nchapter is primarily intended for aspiring en-\ntrepreneurs in search of a business idea, it\nmay also prove useful for entrepreneurs who\nalready have a business but would like to di-\nversify their product or service range.\n2.1\nDo I have the right\ncharacteristics to become a\ngreen entrepreneur?\nGreen entrepreneurs are involved in the pro-\nduction of environmentally friendly products\nand services or make use of processes that\nare environmentally friendly.\nGreen entrepreneurs like any other entrepre-\nneurs need to possess certain characteris-\ntics to be successful. These characteristics\n(passion; goal-orientation; decision-making;\nrisk-taking; ability to handle stress; ability\nto access to social support; financial endow-\nment; business management skills) are dis-\ncussed in detail in the GYB manual.\nIn addition to these general characteristics,\ngreen entrepreneurs need to think about the\nplanet and its people along with profit, so\nsome further characteristics are required.\nWhen completing the assessment in the\nGYB manual, we recommend you also re-\nflect on whether you have these additional\ncharacteristics.\nA GREEN ENTREPRENEUR NEEDS TO BE:\n•\n•\n•\nAnalytical – As the green sector is rela-\ntively new, entrepreneurs venturing into it\nneed to be able to analyze the potential for\nsuccess and failure and plan accordingly.\nInnovative – Green entrepreneurs need\nto be able to “think outside the box” and\ncome up with new solutions to address en-\nvironmental problems.\nCommitted to ethical standards – A green\nentrepreneur needs to think about profit,\nbut also about people and the planet (the\n3 “P”s) when making business decisions.\nWhen developing green business ideas, consider your future market and\nresources that can be availed. This Zambian architect decided to take an\neco-friendly approach while building affordable houses.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 11\n2.2\nComing up with your\ngreen business idea\nYour green idea is the starting point for your\ngreen business.\nThe GYB manual provides guidance on many\ndifferent ways of coming up with business ide-\nas. These include learning from business peo-\nple, drawing from your own and other people’s\nexperiences, surveying your local business area,\nscanning your environment and structured and\nunstructured brainstorming.\nA green business idea can relate to either a\ngreen product or a green service, or it can re-\nlate to a “standard” product or service, but\nwhich is produced or delivered in a green way.\nSome examples of green ideas are provided in\nthe box below.\nSOME GREEN BUSINESS IDEAS:\n•\nOrganic fertilizer\n•\nOrganic beauty products\n•\nBiodegradable packaging\n•\nOrganic restaurant\n•\nSouvenirs made from waste\n•\nEco-tourism\n•\nGreen building materials\n•\nEco-friendly transport service\nIn order to come up with a green business\nidea, you may use the brainstorming exercise\nbelow to complement the exercises in the GYB\nmanual, thinking about what environmental\nproblems need to be solved in your community\nand about what resources in your community\ncould be tapped into:\nENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN THE COMMUNITY\n1a. What health\nand environmental\nproblems exist in\nyour community?\n1b. What is al-\nready being done\nto address these\nproblems?\n1c. What is not\nyet being done at\nall, or what is not\nbeing done well?\nNATURAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY\n2a. Does your\ncommunity have\nany natural re-\nsources or waste\nproducts that\ncould be used for\nbusiness?\n2b. Are there\nalready some\nbusinesses in your\ncommunity that\nmake use of these\nresources?\n2c. Are there any\nuntapped opportu-\nnities to make use\nof these resources?\nYOUR BUSINESS IDEAS\nBased on your answers to question 1c and 2c, list as many\ngreen business ideas as possible:\nIdea 1: Idea 2: Idea 3: Idea 4:\nIdea 5:\nIdea 6:\n12 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n2.3 Screening and\nselecting your green\nbusiness idea\nOnce you have come up with your list of possi-\nble business ideas, you need to decide which\none is the most suitable for you.\nTo do this, you need to describe each idea in\ndetail and then screen them.\nThe GYB manual advises you to use the following\nfive questions to describe each of your ideas:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nWhich need is fulfilled?\nWhat product or service will the business\nsell?\nWho will the business sell to?\nHow will the business sell its product or\nservice?\nHow much will the business depend on and\nimpact the environment?\nWhen completing the description and address-\ning the question on the environmental depend-\nence and impact, consider the following issues:\n•\nTo what extent does the business depend on the surrounding natural environment (soil, wood,\ncharcoal, fish, wind, sun, water, etc.)?\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\n•\nWill the business have a positive impact on the environment (clean the water, improve the\nsoil, etc.)?\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\n•\nWill the business affect the environment in any negative way?\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\nTYPE OF IMPACT Y N N/A\nDETAILS ON THE NEGATIVE\nIMPACTS & WAYS IN WHICH THEY\nCAN BE AVOIDED OR MINIMIZED:\nWill it use large amounts of fossil\nfuel-based energy?\nWill it use large amounts of water?\nWill it use natural resources that are\nin short supply or overexploited?\nWill it require the use of harmful\nchemicals?\nWill it generate large amounts of\nsolid waste?\nWill it create air pollution?\nWill it create soil pollution?\nWill it create water pollution?\nThe GYB manual then advises you to carry\nout a “Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities\nand Threats” (SWOT) analysis to assess a few\nof your ideas and identify the best idea from\namong your list.\nWhen doing the SWOT exercise, you should\nalso keep in mind strengths, weaknesses, op-\nportunities and threats that relate specifically\nto the green dimension of your product.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 13\nGreen SWOT analysis example:\nSTRENGTHS WEAKNESSES\nConventional\nstrengths\nHigh-revenue product\nGreen\nstrengths\nEnergy & material\nefficient production pro-\ncess can decrease costs\nand increase profits\nConventional\nweaknesses\nLack of skilled labour\nGreen\nweaknesses\nLack of knowhow to\nproduce innovative prod-\nucts (e.g. solar panels)\nneeded for the idea\nOPPORTUNITIES THREATS\nConventional\nopportunities\nUpcoming market for\nthis product\nGreen\nopportunities\nLarge consumer base for\neco-friendly & healthy\nproducts\nConventional\nthreats\nCheaper product availa-\nble in the market\nGreen\nthreats\nGovernment subsidies\nfor competing, non-\ngreen products\nImportant: Remember that even if your\nmain motivation is to help overcome an en-\nvironmental problem, you cannot only think\nabout the environmental dimensions when\nassessing your idea. It is equally important\nto assess the economic dimensions such as\nwhether there will be sufficient demand for\nthe product or service. If your business idea\nis not economically viable, it cannot succeed,\nno matter how noble the idea may be. So you\nneed a sound business idea to be able to help\nthe environment!\n14 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n3\nYOUR GREEN\nBUSINESS PLAN\nAs you now know, a green business may be a\nbusiness that sells green products or services,\nor which operates according to green princi-\nples. Green businesses therefore contribute\nto solving environmental problems and have a\nminimal negative impact on the environment.\nIn order to launch your business, you need to\ndevelop a business plan. The Start Your Busi-\nness (SYB) package has a detailed step-by-\nstep process for developing a business plan.\nThe business plan for your green business\nneeds to be adapted to include key elements\nthat are critical in starting a green business. In\naddition to coming up with a viable green busi-\nness idea (see Chapter 2 for guidance), as you\nThe founder of Lemonbar decided to start a business that serves organic\ndrinks to a health-oriented clientele. To get started with your green business,\na first step is the development of a business plan.\nplan for starting your green business it is im-\nportant to also look at the business processes\nand workplace behaviours and practices with\nthe objective of increasing resource efficiency,\nclean production and reducing any possible\nnegative impacts on the environment.\nThis section of the GBB highlights some im-\nportant green aspects to include in the busi-\nness plan.\nA more in-depth overview of how to green your\nprocesses by setting up an environmental\nmanagement system (EMS), also important for\nyour business plan, is provided in the following\nchapter, as it is applicable not only to starting\nenterprises, but also existing ones.\n3.1 The green dimensions of\nyour business plan\nWriting a green business plan is one of the\nmost important steps for starting up a green\nbusiness. The development of the plan is not\nan overnight process and may take several\nweeks to complete. The business plan for your\ngreen business should cover all the aspects to\nbe considered before starting the business.\nThe main components of a business plan are\noutlined in this chapter. For all the compo-\nnents of your business plan, you need to make\nsure that you add any green dimensions that\nare relevant.\nThese green dimensions may relate to:\n•\nHow the environment is affected by the par-\nticular business plan component: for exam-\nple, in terms of marketing, when consider-\ning distribution, long-distance transport will\nbe more damaging to the environment than\nshort distances.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 15\n•\nHow each of the business plan components\nis affected by the green characteristic of your\nproduct/service: for example, when consider-\ning the price, you may be able to charge more\nthan your competitors because customers may\nbe willing to pay more for a green product, and\nyou may thereby enjoy a higher profit margin.\nYou will note that the business plan also in-\ncludes a section on greening your business.\nGreening is a cross-cutting issue that will come\nup in most other sections of your business plan.\nHowever, it is useful to give greening specific\nattention through a section specifically devoted\nto summarising all the required measures.\nBUSINESS PLAN\nCOMPONENT\nPURPOSE &\nGREEN DIMENSION\nExecutive summary The executive summary is an outline of your green business idea. In addition to\nthe generic issues covered in a business plan, the summary should highlight its\ngreen dimensions.\nYour business idea All business plans are based on an idea. In describing your idea, you need to high-\nlight what makes it unique as a green business (in terms of the product/service or\nprocess).\nThe marketing plan Your marketing plan needs to be based on a solid understanding of the market.\nOnce you know your market, you then need to develop a marketing plan based\non the 7 “P”s: Product, Price, Place, Promotion, People, Process, and Physical\nEvidence. Consider the environmental dimension of these 7 “P”s when developing\nthe plan (for example, for “Price”, whether you can charge a premium price).\nStaff You will need to decide what your business’ staffing needs are based on what tasks\nneed to be performed. When assessing what staff you need, consider whether any\nadditional technical skills are needed for your green product/service.\nOrganization and\nmanagement\nLike any entrepreneur, you will need to decide on the form of business. A green\nbusiness can take one of many forms, including a sole proprietorship, a partner-\nship, or a cooperative, for example. You should weigh the pros and cons of each\nbefore choosing the best form.\nYou will also need to consider all required taxes and permits and select an appro-\npriate insurance policy; make sure to include environmental taxes and environ-\nmental permits when doing so.\nBuying for your\nbusiness\nYour business will need to buy before you make or sell your products/services.\nWhen buying for your business, consider how environmentally friendly the materi-\nals or equipment you buy are.\nGreening your\nprocesses\nGreening your processes covers a range of elements, starting from how environ-\nmentally friendly your raw materials are to how you get your product to your final\nconsumers. To ensure the environmental-friendliness of your enterprise, you should\nset up an environmental management system (EMS). This system will help you\ntrack and improve your performance in key areas such as procurement, energy and\nwater consumption, pollution prevention, distribution and waste management.\nCosting To be able to set your price and make a financial plan, you will need to calculate\nthe cost of your products. Keep in mind that you may incur some additional costs\nat the outset for green investments relating to equipment, premises or skills, but\nalso that you will most likely make savings thanks to green practices such a re-\nduced consumption of electricity or water, resulting in reduced utility bills.\nFinancial planning You need to be able to plan and monitor the financial situation of your business\nusing tools such as the profit plan and a cash flow plan. Like any other business,\nyour green business needs to perform financially, otherwise you will not be able to\nkeep it going!\nRequired start-up\ncapital\nWhen estimating the required start-up capital, you will need to assess your needs\nin terms of capital investment and working capital. Consider the elements required\nfor your business to be green while estimating this cost, and be realistic when\ndoing so.\nSources of start-up\ncapital\nThe most important types of start-up capital are owner’s equity and loans. Keep in\nmind that there are also a number of institutions with special funding opportuni-\nties for green businesses.\"FOL:\nRecommendation # 1:\nTitle: \nDescription: \nInclude consideration of the relevance of integrating green elements, of having green as a competitive advantage (+  maybe a way of attracting investors) \nSee ‘Green Business Booklet’ page 12 +  16 for tips on how to come up with a green business idea, and/or think greening into the different parts of the business plan\"Here are the slides [[[THE BUSINESS PLAN\n----\nAgenda\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Intro to the business plan\n9:45 | Business plan components\n10:15 | Break\n10:30 | Design and practice!\n11:55 - 12:00 | Wrap up\n----\n\n9:00 | Settle in\nTea/coffee\nAnswer entrepreneur questions related to their prototypes, the pitch or anything else.\n\n9:15 | Begin the session\nGood morning everyone! How are you doing today? \nToday, we will talk all about your business plan. Up to this point, you thought everything through and you are starting to actually start your businesses!

After pitching or getting some interest from an investor/granting organization, they might ask you for more information. Depending on the person, they might ask for a meeting or for a copy of your business plan. This business plan is your chance to show your professionalism and to dive into the details of your action plan. Many people think of a business plan as a long boring document that nobody looks at (which some people still do), but the business plan has evolved over time. It is detailed, but avoids unnecessary content. The main thing to show is where your business has been, where it is going, and how you plan on getting there.\nClassical: \nLong 50 page documents that nobody reads. \nTo many unnecessary details. \nQuantity over quality. \nBlack and white, text heavy, boring.\nModern: \nThere has been a shift to either pitch decks or short comprehensive plans. \nThese business plans are action oriented and interesting for the reader. \nQuality over quantity.\nRepresents your brand, highly visual, interesting.\n\n2 minutes: Transition\nAll of those points are correct, what we will do now is cover some of the key elements that should be included in a business plan. None of this is new, throughout the incubator you have already done this! Now it is about putting it together on one clean document! We will go over the points briefly, then we will spend the rest of the session working on them. You can follow along on your business plan template we sent you.\n\n3\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWhere you are now\nHow you plan on getting there\nWhere you want to be\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe executive summary is the first thing in a business plan, but the very last thing you write. After you write out the whole business plan, you pull out the most important information and create a one page teaser document. This will highlight all of the important points you want to make in a brief overview.  It explains:\nWhere you are now: Why do you do what you do? Why are you here? What is the problem you have identified and what is the solution (your product/service)?\nWhere you want to be: What is the end result you are looking to achieve? What is the long-term impact and growth potential of your business?\nHow you plan on getting there: How are you planning to accomplish this? How do you know this will work?\n\nIf it wasn’t covered in the earlier brainstorm, ask: Why is this section really important to have?\nYou can send this out to people who might be interested in your business. If they are interested, they might ask for more information\nYou should be able to sum up the key elements of your business plan in one page! Where are you now, where do you want to go, and how will you get there?\nIt will highlight the most important things. People don’t have to read the whole thing if they don’t want to. \n\n\n\n4\n\nBUSINESS DESCRIPTION\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe next section is your business description. This is a really high level explanation of what you do. Be clear and simple. Don’t try to be fancy and use complicated explanations or jargon. You want people to really understand who you are and why you are here. \nAsk: When describing your business, which points should you include?\nDescription: Tell us about your business. Who are you, why are you here, and what do you do (think challenge-solution)? \nMake sure the way you talk about your business is consistent on your pitch, business plan, website, and social media. \nIf you talk about your business one way in the executive summary, talk about it the same way in your business description!\nMission Statement, Vision, values, and Goals: What do you want to accomplish through the existence of your business (usually not financial accomplishments)?\nRemember, write what works. If you think it is repetitive and not effective to write all of these, then don’t! You choose what will tell the best story for your business (where you have been, where you are going, how you will get there)\nProducts and services:  What are you offering, and what is its unique value? Be clear and obvious here.  \nAsk: When describing your products, what should you include? \nPotential answers:\nThe name of your products/services (write all revenue streams)\nPricing mechanism\nCompetitive advantage of each product/service\nAny patents? Copyrights?\nPhotos/screenshots (professional-looking ones!)\n\n5\n\nMANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION\n 3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe next section is your business management and organization. How will your business operate? What are key operational or organizational elements of your business that will be key to its success? \nAsk: When thinking about your management and organization, which points should you include?\nAllow entrepreneurs to share their thoughts.\nMake sure to touch on a few main points:\nYour team/organizational structure:\nWho is there now? What experience does your team bring to ensure the success of this business?\nWho do you plan to have on your team? Consider adding a hiring timeline of key and operational teammates.\nWhat kind of management and structure do you have? Consider including an “organigram” to show how the structure, reporting, and information flows to the different members of your team. \nDo you have a board of advisors?\nA solo founder isn’t convincing to investors. They want to see a strong passionate team and a supportive network to reassure them. \nYour legal structure:\nLegal requirements. Should you be registered to operate? How will you register?\nWhat is your legal structure? Are you a non profit? Are you a corporation, are you the only owner (sole proprietorship)?\nAre there any particular safety or health requirements you should follow?\nThis section is not necessary for everyone\nKey partners:\nDo you have any key partners, distributors, manufacturers, etc… that you are working with? \nExplain how your business will operate in coordination with other key players\nThis is not necessary for everyone\n6\n\nWho are your customers?\nHow big is the market?\nIs it growing?\nWho else is in the market? \nMARKET ANALYSIS\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe next section is your market analysis. Show evidence based on research. You can take the information from your feasibility study and add it in here. Who are your customers and competitors? How big is the market? \nAsk: If you wanted to prove with evidence that your business was a good bet in this market, what would you want to show?\nPotential answers:\n Good feedback from user research and testing\n Market size and future growth potential\n Trends that indicate shifting consumer preferences, operational efficiencies, or regulatory changes that may impact your business\n PESTEL analysis\n Competitive benchmarking or analysis (how your business fills those gaps)\n Supporting data (any research or figures that shows the market need or demand for a product like yours)\n Risk analysis\n Etc..\n[[Original - Potential answers:\nGood feedback from user research and testing\nMarket size\nMajor trends/risks that your business could take advantage of \nPESTEL analysis\nCompetitive benchmarking or analysis (how your business fills those gaps)\nSupporting data (any research or figures that shows the market need or demand for a product like yours)\nEtc…]]]\n\n7\n\nACTION PLAN\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nNext, we have the action plan. What will you do to make this business a success? How can you convince the people around you that this is a sustainable idea and you have thought everything through? Your action plan should clearly explain the steps you will take to turn the idea into a reality (or take your existing business and take it to the next level). Make sure that this is really practical, realistic, and reflects your financial projections. \nAsk: What could be included in your action plan? \nPotential answers:\nGo to market strategy\nGrowth and milestones\nSales and marketing strategy\nLocations\nStrategy\nTimeline\nPotential partners, distributors, and manufacturers\nHow do your startup costs/investment play into this action plan?\n8\n\n\nWhat’s do you need to turn this into reality?\nHow much do you think you will make in 1 year?\nHow much in 3 years?\nFINANCIAL PROJECTIONS\n$\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nNext, we have the financial projections.\nAsk: What should you show in terms of your financials? What story are you telling here?\nFinancial history: Show evidence that this idea will work through actual sales!\nWhat sales have you already made?\nCan you show any traction?\nKey financial or profitability ratios such as CAC, gross margin, and others we have talked about in the past (these can be very meaningful on actual financials)\n\nFinancial projections: Show where you expect to be going over the next few years!\nForecasting for 3-5 years\nThey should be strong numbers, but also realistic and based on facts or your market research.\nDoes this have potential to make money? \nWhen will you break even? \nBalance sheet/income statement/cash flow statements are all things that could be included. Remember to put a summary here or 3 year highlights. You can add detailed financials to the appendix if you want.\nKey financial or profitability ratios (these won’t be as meaningful if you don’t have a financial history because it is mostly made up)\n9\n\nAPPENDICES\n1 hour and 25 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\nFinally we have the appendices. You can add anything in here really, just remember to only add things that add value to the story you are telling. Don’t add things for no reason. What do you want to show that will prove that your ideas are great?\nAsk: What else might you want to include as an attachment to your business plan? \nPotential answers:\nSummary of research\nComplicated charts that you don’t want in the body of your document\nScreenshots of detailed financials\nCompetitive benchmarking\nSWOT analysis\nPictures of your product\nPictures of people using your product\nEtc…\n\n1 hour: Activity\nLet the entrepreneurs work on their business plans for the next hour. \nThey can use the template we provided, Canva, or anything else. \nRemind them that they can be creative with this and add or remove any sections they would like based on what they think would be valuable information.\n\n20 minutes: Share\nBring them back for the last 20 minutes or so to go around the room and share. \nWhat was each entrepreneur able to accomplish during this time? \nDid anyone have any trouble? Did anyone have any great successes that they would like to share?\n\n10\n\nDESIGN AND LAYOUT\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe last point we will talk about is the Design and layout of your business plan. Just like a pitch deck, your business plan should be well thought through and designed carefully. You should match themes with your pitch deck, website, application, Facebook page, social media, and more. Remember, you are creating a brand!\nPoint out that they should feel free to adjust the template we sent out in any they want. We sent a simple word document plan, which is acceptable. \nSubstance is more important than design! The design should be there to make it more readable and understandable first. \nShow them alternative layouts (click through the slides):\nTell them to go onto Canva to find some simple, yet creative business plan templates. Simply search “business plan” into the search bar and several options will come up.\nPoint out that these are just examples and they should find a theme that represents their brand. It should have their logos, photos of their products, and their color and font schemes. \n\n\nAsk: Based on what you know about branding, how should you design your business plan?\nUse the same fonts and color scheme.\nMake it visually appealing, clear, and easy to read\nIt should have your own touch to it and be linked to who you are and what you are doing. Link your UVP into this as well. \nAre you innovative? Be innovative here as well. \nAre you creative? Be creative here. \nAre you highly professional? Your document should be highly professional.\nEtc…\n\n11\n\n\n Create a first draft of your business plan.\n\n Please keep in mind:\nCheck your spelling and grammar!\nDetails are everything.\nSource your information & explain assumptions.\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n13]]]",

      "content": "### Recommendations for Applying the Integrated Business Resilience Framework & Green Considerations\n\nAfter reviewing the slides, facilitator notes, and the **Green Business Booklet**, I see several opportunities to **integrate green business elements** into your session while aligning with your client's needs.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Strengthening Green Business Considerations in Each Section**\nYour **Integrated Business Resilience Framework** likely focuses on long-term sustainability, adaptability, and risk management. These concepts naturally align with the green business approach. Here’s how you can integrate these ideas into key parts of the business plan framework:\n\n#### **a. Executive Summary**\n- **Add:** A line emphasizing **how sustainability is a competitive advantage** in the market.\n- **Example:** “By integrating green practices, we reduce costs, attract environmentally conscious customers, and position our business for long-term success.”\n\n#### **b. Business Description**\n- **Include:** A dedicated bullet point explaining how sustainability is embedded in the business model (either through a green product, service, or process).\n- **Example:** “Our business prioritizes sustainability by using recycled materials, reducing waste, and optimizing supply chain logistics for minimal carbon impact.”\n\n#### **c. Market Analysis**\n- **Enhance:** By incorporating insights into the growing demand for sustainable products/services.\n- **Example Prompts for Discussion:**\n  - What are key **regulatory trends** favoring green businesses?\n  - How does eco-conscious consumer behavior create **market opportunities**?\n  - Are there **certifications or green funding** opportunities available?\n\n#### **d. Action Plan**\n- **Add:** A “Greening Your Business” section that includes specific actions related to environmental sustainability (e.g., sustainable sourcing, waste reduction, energy efficiency).\n- **Prompt:** “How can we incorporate environmental impact reduction in our operations and supply chain?”\n\n#### **e. Financial Projections**\n- **Adjust:** The financial section should highlight **cost savings from green practices** and potential access to **grants, impact investment, or subsidies for green businesses**.\n- **Example:** “By using energy-efficient equipment, we reduce costs by 20% annually. Additionally, we qualify for [insert relevant local/international green funding].”\n\n#### **f. Appendices**\n- **Add:** A dedicated “Green Business Impact” section summarizing:\n  - The business’s environmental contributions.\n  - Any certifications or green policies followed.\n  - Potential cost savings and revenue benefits from green practices.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Facilitator Notes: Enhancing Green Business Integration**\nTo **improve engagement and discussion** around green business, facilitators can:\n✅ **Ask targeted questions** during each section:\n   - “How can integrating sustainability give your business an edge in securing funding?”\n   - “How does your product/service contribute to environmental improvement?”\n   - “Can you identify cost savings from adopting eco-friendly practices?”\n✅ **Use real-world examples** of green businesses to demonstrate feasibility.\n✅ **Encourage participants to brainstorm green opportunities** based on their existing business ideas.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Making Green Business More Visible in the Slides**\nYour slides currently follow a **standard business plan structure**, but they can **better highlight green elements** by:\n- **Adding a slide on ‘Why Green Business Matters’** early in the presentation.\n- **Incorporating a Green SWOT Example** in the Market Analysis section.\n- **Using green-themed icons and visuals** to highlight sustainability topics.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\nYour slides and notes are **well-structured and engaging**, but integrating sustainability more explicitly will **add value and better align with the Green Business Booklet recommendations**. Let me know if you’d like **specific slide edits or an updated version with green elements integrated!** 🚀",

What is the long-term impact and growth potential of your business?\nHow you plan on getting there: How are you planning to accomplish this? How do you know this will work?\nWhen summarizing your business, consider mentioning any environmental benefits or efficiency measures that give you a competitive edge or cost advantage.\n\nIf it wasn’t covered in the earlier brainstorm, ask: Why is this section really important to have?\nYou can send this out to people who might be interested in your business. If they are interested, they might ask for more information\nYou should be able to sum up the key elements of your business plan in one page!

You want people to really understand who you are and why you are here.\\nAsk: When describing your business, which points should you include?\\nDescription: Tell us about your business. Who are you, why are you here, and what do you do (think challenge-solution)?\\nMake sure the way you talk about your business is consistent on your pitch, business plan, website, and social media.\\nIf you talk about your business one way in the executive summary, talk about it the same way in your business description!\\nMission Statement, Vision, Values, and Goals: What do you want to accomplish through the existence of your business? (For instance, sustainability in your mission/values could strengthen your market position, but this will vary by business.)\\nRemember, write what works. If you think it is repetitive and not effective to write all of these, then don’t! You choose what will tell the best story for your business (where you have been, where you are going, how you will get there).\\nProducts and services: What are you offering, and what is its unique value? Be clear and obvious here.\\nAsk: When describing your products, what should you include?\\nPotential answers:\\n- The name of your products/services (write all revenue streams)\\n- Pricing mechanism\\n- Competitive advantage of each product/service\\n- The values your business embodies in its product/service (e.g., quality, efficiency, sustainability, or innovation)\\n- Any patents? Copyrights?\\n- Photos/screenshots (professional-looking ones!)\\n]]]\\n\\n[[[Executive Summary 3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\\n\\nThe executive summary is the first thing in a business plan, but the very last thing you write. After you write out the whole business plan, you pull out the most important information and create a one-page teaser document. This will highlight all of the important points you want to make in a brief overview. It explains:\\n- Where you are now: Why do you do what you do? Why are you here? What is the problem you have identified, and what is the solution (your product/service)?\\n- Where you want to be: What is the end result you are looking to achieve? What is the long-term impact and growth potential of your business?\\n- How you plan on getting there: How are you planning to accomplish this? How do you know this will work?\\n\\nWhen summarizing your business, consider mentioning any **efficiency measures, cost advantages, or environmental benefits** that might enhance your competitive edge (if applicable).\\n\\nIf it wasn’t covered in the earlier brainstorm, ask: Why is this section really important to have?\\n- You can send this out to people who might be interested in your business. If they are interested, they might ask for more information.\\n- You should be able to sum up the key elements of your business plan in one page! Where are you now, where do you want to go, and how will you get there?\\n- It will highlight the most important things. People don’t have to read the whole thing if they don’t want to.\\n]]]\\n\\n[[[Business Plan 20-30 minutes: Discussion\\n\\nAsk: What do you guys know about business plans? Why is it useful to have one?\\n- Show stakeholders that you have a clear strategy and plan for long-term success.\\n- Demonstrate that your business idea is viable and has a strong market foundation.\\n- Detail an effective implementation strategy, ensuring **sustainability in business operations** (in terms of longevity and adaptability, not just environmental aspects).\\n- Help you think through the different parts of your business.\\n- Provide more detail to your pitch.\\n\\nHighlights several points in detail:\\n- Business overview\\n- Market research\\n- Operational plan\\n- Team\\n- Financials\\n\\nAsk: What are the different parts of a business plan? What are the things that you should show to prove that you have the best idea out there?\\nHave the entrepreneurs explain what they think is most important.\\nTry to write out the flow of an entire business plan based on what they say.\\nAfter, go through the next slides to touch on the points they missed or go deeper on the important elements.\\n\\nRecap: A business plan is just like your pitch in the sense that it tells a story about why your business is a good bet. After pitching or getting some interest from an investor/granting organization, they might ask you for more information. Depending on the person, they might ask for a meeting or for a copy of your business plan. This business plan is your chance to show your professionalism and to dive into the details of your action plan. Many people think of a business plan as a long boring document that nobody looks at (which some people still do), but the business plan has evolved over time. It is detailed but avoids unnecessary content. The main thing to show is where your business has been, where it is going, and how you plan on getting there.\\n\\nClassical:\\n- Long 50-page documents that nobody reads.\\n- Too many unnecessary details.\\n- Quantity over quality.\\n- Black and white, text-heavy, boring.\\n\\nModern:\\n- There has been a shift to either pitch decks or short comprehensive plans.\\n- These business plans are action-oriented and interesting for the reader.\\n- Quality over quantity.\\n- Represents your brand, highly visual, and engaging.\\n\\n**Green Business Considerations**\\n\\nFor those interested in incorporating green elements into their business plan, consider:\\n- How does your business minimize environmental impact?\\n- Are there cost-saving opportunities through sustainable practices?\\n- Can sustainability be a competitive advantage for attracting customers or investors?\\n\\n2 minutes: Transition\\nAll of those points are correct. What we will do now is cover some of the key elements that should be included in a business plan. None of this is new—throughout the incubator, you have already done this! Now it is about putting it together in one clean document! We will go over the points briefly, then we will spend the rest of the session working on them. You can follow along on your business plan template we sent you.\\n]]]\"}",

How are you doing today? \nToday we will be talking about your supply chain. Many of your products/services have some physical element to it. We will break down how you get those things and how they impact your business and customers. If you don’t have a physical element to your business (many tech businesses), this information is still good to know. A lot of what we will talk about are just good business practices in general.  \n1\n\nExperience a rapid product development process.\nUnderstand the different parts of your supply chain.\nEvaluate how to add value along your supply chain.\n\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nExperience a rapid product development process.\nUnderstand the different parts of your supply chain.\nEvaluate how to add value along your supply chain.\n2\n\nDEVELOP A \u000bNEW PRODUCT\n1 hour: Activity (you can find an alternate online activity on the drive)\n5 Minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work in groups to go through a rapid product development process.\nTell everyone they are a business developing a new product that will be sold to the training team: a paper airplane. The plane has to fly and look good. The price will reflect its design, functionality, and how efficiently it is produced. Based on the trainers' thoughts on your plane, they will give your plane a selling price.\nBreak the group into small teams (about 3 people per team).\nThe trainer should have prototyping materials ready, including paper, markers, stickers, etc. These items are available to the entrepreneurs to continue using as they want throughout the entire game. They can use whatever they want.\nEntrepreneurs are free to continue asking the trainers (the people buying the planes) questions about the activity/type of plane to design (they can do user research to find out more about how to design their plane based on customers' needs/wants).\nEntrepreneurs should feel free to work with their groups wherever they are comfortable.\n55 Minutes: Activity\n10 minutes: The team will have 10 minutes to design a new product (paper airplane). Encourage them to consider how to make an effective design while using materials efficiently.\n10 minutes: Each group will pitch their plane to the trainer.\nThe trainer will evaluate functionality, design, and the overall pitch to determine a price for each plane.\nThe trainer can also consider the amount of work that went into the plane design. Did the team create a design that maximized performance while minimizing wasted materials?\nThe trainer should set prices like $2, $5, $10, $15, $20 depending on detail and flying capabilities. Try to have a variety of prices.\nTell them that each plane costs $5 to make (make it all the same to keep it simple). When we price the plane, some people will get better margins or worse margins.\nAnd some people would be able to produce a lot or a little, causing different levels of profitability. Some designs might be more efficient, allowing for faster production or lower costs. It depends on how the game goes, but interesting conversations come up.\n15 Minutes: Scaling Up the Production\nAnnounce to the groups that you like all of the planes they pitched and you would like to purchase them for your store.\nThey will have 10 minutes to produce 15 of the planes they pitched.\nHalfway through this time (after about 7 minutes), announce a change in demand:\nYou are expecting high demand for these planes after a focus group, and you would like to order 25 planes instead.\nAnnounce that you will extend the delivery time by 5 additional minutes (13 minutes left for production).\n15 Minutes: Evaluation & Discussion\nBring everyone back and tell people production has stopped—they must now deliver their products.\nThe trainer will now pay each group for their product.\nCount each plane that matches the one they pitched. Reject planes that do not work or do not match what they pitched to you.\nMultiply the number of accepted planes by the price that was set before mass production.\nSubtract $5 for each plane they made (even if the plane was rejected because they produced it).\nCalculate who made the most money!\nTrainer Tip: Make it more fun by offering a small piece of candy for each $ of profit they made. (Some teams might realize that a more efficient process leads to higher profits!) Some people might owe you candy at the end if they weren’t profitable….

And write key learning outcomes on the whiteboard or Jamboard.\nPotential questions to ask: \nWhat did you learn from this activity?\nWhat was your team approach to this activity? \nHow did you decide what plane to do (listened to one paper plane expert on the team, tested many to find the best, copied someone else, simple and efficient basic plane, etc…)?\nWhat challenges came up? What did you learn from those challenges?\nWere there any successes? What worked so well?\nDid you prepare for production during your design phase?\nDid you think about who on your team will manufacture the plane? Did everyone on the team know how to make it?\nWhen manufacturing, were you able to keep the product consistent? \n\nPossible learning outcomes can include: \nCommunication is important (with your team and with your clients). \nSome teams forgot about the bigger picture (they are selling a product). Focus on the end game.\nMake sure you know what you are getting into before agreeing to anything\nConsider available resources and your actual capabilities while designing\nBe prepared to meet customers changing demands quickly and accurately\nConsider negotiating when necessary. Most people just agreed when they were asked to deliver more products. You could have agreed, or negotiated to only make the ones that you could. That is a business decision. Can you adapt quickly and meet the demand? Or should you stick with your original contract and do what you agreed to at high quality? Maybe you weren’t actually capable of doing it, that is ok. But keep in mind, in real life, demand can change in an instant and you would want to capitalize on that if possible.\n\nRecap: These are all really important things that we learned. However, the real question is how do we take these learnings and create systems so that we don’t make the same mistakes when we are actually running our business? \n\n5\n\nResearch, design, & development\nMarketing and sales\nProduction and delivery\nQuality control\nDEVELOPMENT PROCESS\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\nDiscuss what you did as a group and how it is linked to any typical business and its activities. If these points were covered on the previous slide, just quickly recap them and move on.\nResearch, Design, and Development: All businesses have to do the right research before starting their business. Based on that research, they should design, test, and build out their full set of products/services.\nAsk:\n Did anyone ask me what kind of plane I was interested in? Or what I needed it for?\n Who will use it? Or what color and design I might like?\n Could you have made a design that was easier to build?\n If you did, you would have gotten a leg up in the exercise because you might have been able to plan better, know how many I wanted, or know which planes I was interested in “buying.” Early-stage research can prevent inefficiencies, help businesses design smarter, and more scalable products.\n Never forget about how important this step is. Make the time to do the right research to set yourself up for success down the line.\n\n Marketing and Sales: Each team had their product evaluated and accepted or rejected from the “market.” Your price was set by the quality of the plane and how it met my needs.\n Many of you were very clever during your pitch. Some of you targeted emotions, some of you targeted functionality, etc. It would have been really smart if you knew what I wanted the plane for by doing the right research ahead of time.\n Ask: How does knowing your customer’s needs help you sell more efficiently?\n \n Production and Delivery: All of you have great ideas, but if you can’t make and deliver your product/service to the market, then your business will fail!\n Some planes were priced really high because they were really amazing, but it was too much for them to deliver!\n Maybe you made a plane that only one person on the team knew how to make, and it was really time-consuming.\n Some of you ran out of raw materials.\n Ask: Did anyone experience this? What did you do to get around the challenge?\n\n Quality Control: Never forget about quality control! So many of you gave planes that I didn’t want. They were poor quality, and I refused to pay for them, which cost your business.\n You should put a system in place to make sure that the quality of your product is ensured at every step while also maintaining efficiency.\n Ask: Who had a system for quality control? What worked well, what didn’t?\n\n Recap: At each of these steps, there was an opportunity to make me a happy customer and provide me with value. You can either lower your costs or make your product more tailored to customer needs—but the best businesses do both.\n When developing your product, think about:\n How it will be produced efficiently.\n How it will be shipped at the lowest cost.\n How it will be stored without waste.\n How it will be packaged to balance protection and material use.\n\n The design of the product itself is one of the key steps that will determine your supply chain. Entrepreneurs should ask themselves how they will actually be able to manage the successful delivery of a product to their customers. To do that, you have to carefully break down each step. \n[[Original Version]]\nDiscuss what you did as a group and how it is linked to any typical business and its activities.

You can either lower your costs, or you could have made it more tailored to my needs. When developing your product, think about how this design will be produced, shipped, stored, packaged, and more. The design of the product itself is one of the key steps that will determine your supply chain. As you develop a product or service, entrepreneurs should ask themselves how they will actually be able to manage the successful delivery of a product to their customers. To do that, you have to carefully break down each step. \n\n6\n\nUNDERSTAND YOUR CAPABILITIES\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nBefore you get into any agreement, make sure that you fully understand your capabilities before you agree to anything. \nAsk: What are the things that you should be sure of (in terms of your capabilities) to make sure that you can deliver on the work you are agreeing to. \nPotential answers:\nYou can get the materials to make the product/service. \nThe materials are of the quality that you want and your customers demand\nYou have enough time to make and deliver your product/service. This includes you and your team. \nYou are choosing materials and suppliers that balance cost, reliability, and efficiency.\nYou have considered how the availability of materials and production methods could affect your delivery timeline.\nYou have the knowledge and skill set to deliver your product or service. Each member of your team has the knowledge and skills to work efficiently and collaboratively. \nYou have the money and resources to deliver your product or service.\nYou have the energy, patience, and excitement to deliver this product or service. \n7\n\nAdapt quickly:\nBUSINESS EFFICIENCY CHECKLIST\nFacilitator notes:\nUse the Business Efficiency Workbook to Optimize Your Supply Chain\nEncourage participants to use the checklist to evaluate their own supply chain processes and identify where they can optimize.\nSuggest that businesses periodically review their efficiency levels using this tool to adapt to market changes.\nAsk: What areas in your supply chain could be improved using this checklist?\n8\n\nAdapt quickly:\nIntegrated supply chain\nCommunication \nUnderstand customers\nADAPT QUICKLY\u000b\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAnother technique to help your supply chain is by enabling yourself to be able to adapt quickly. In the activity we did, we created 1 item, imagine doing this for hundreds or thousands of items. What if you were working in several cities and you had many employees to get onboard a new project? What would you do if you had to adapt quickly? What systems should you have in place to allow for quick and adaptive responses? Sometimes there are crises that happen (Coronavirus for example) that totally change things. How will your business adapt quickly and efficiently? \n\nAsk: What are ways that you can enable yourself to adapt quickly and respond to change?\nPotential answers: \nIntegrated supply chain: Create a supply chain that connects all the different partners in one place through a system that facilitates good communication and efficiency. Ask: What can you do to create an “integrated supply chain”?\nCoordinate the movement of your products and services. Track your shipments or other arrangements with suppliers online. Although you might not have a digital system, you can ask the person to give you weekly updates on the status of your deliveries.  \nMake sure that there is always a path for clear information flows with key partners (see communication point below)\nHave each of your partners in your supply chain communicating with each if relevant. \nReduce the number of steps in your supply chain, or find a supplier that can deal with multiple steps (or you can take control of more steps)\nUse technology to manage the supply chain more efficiently and know what is happening at each step. There is software for this, but probably not relevant for businesses at this stage\nEtc…\nCommunication - When you are developing/designing the product, make sure you communicate with all the stakeholders\nCommunication with partners:\nHave a system to quickly share information with key partners (tell a supplier about change in demand, for example)\nThis could be through the phone, email, or something else, but it can be slow and is susceptible to a lot of human error. \nYou can purchase online systems \nDesignate certain employees to be the communicators to certain partners\nEtc…\nCommunication with your team:\nDoes the team know why they are doing this? \nMake a clear connection between marketing, design, procurement, and other teams in your organization\nWhat is the system in place to communicate big news and information? – Which system is best to make sure key information is made clear to the team and things aren’t lost along the way?\nSlack\nEmail?\nFace to face?\nUnderstand customers: \nInternet (gather data on them)\nAsk them (surveys, feedback, SM, etc…)\nLearn from other parts of the supply chain (integrate processes so you can observe changes in demand)\nEtc...\n\nRecap: Be responsive to changing customer demands and changing markets. Do this by putting systems in place to be able to forecast potential trends and also communicate with key partners to adapt quickly. \n\n9\n\nINVENTORY MANAGEMENT\u000b\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nBefore you get into any agreement, make sure that you fully understand your capabilities before you agree to anything. \nAsk: What are the things that you should consider while managing inventory? What systems can you put in place to make sure that your inventory is being managed well?\nPotential answers:\nCategorize your assets in a logical way so that you always know what is there and you can easily organize information. This prevents unnecessary purchases and waste. \nDigitize your inventory. Consider buying a software to manage inventory. Or keep digital records by tracking your purchases and sales. Digital tracking helps prevent overstocking or running out of key materials.\nManage inventory based on safety levels. Make sure you set a range on how much inventory you need at one time. You don’t want too much because it can be expensive to store, materials can expire or degrade, and space can be wasted, etc… And you don’t want to run out of materials because then you miss out on sales opportunities or slow down production! Find a good level, and stick to it. Keep records so you can learn about seasonal trends over time (in case inventory changes seasonally, safety levels might change too)\nPerform routine checks. Check in on your inventory now and again to make sure that your digital records are accurate. Maybe things aren’t being managed correctly causing broken, stolen, or damaged products.\nEtc…\n10\n\nSales \nPromotion\nSUPPLY CHAIN MAPPING\n10 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nA Supply Chain is the entire system of producing and delivering a product or a service, from the very beginning stage of sourcing the raw materials to the final customer. \nLet’s do an example together. Let’s take a simple mug and break down its supply chain together and identify areas to make a more efficient supply chain.\nUse some of the questions below to prompt the group to map out the full supply chain for a mug (or another example):\nWhat are the raw materials needed for this product? Where are they found?\nWhat are the steps involved in making this product? Where does each step in the production take place?\nWhat energy is needed to produce this item? Where does that energy come from?\nWhat kind of transportation, if any, is needed at each stage of the production process, including getting the finished product to you?\nWhich steps does the business control vs other companies? Are there opportunities for the business to control more? Would it be a good idea to take control?\nPotential answer for the supply chain mapping of a mug:\nPurchase the best materials (procurement) – Maybe we buy the ceramic mugs from China and cardboard boxes for packaging from another retailer in China. These items get shipped through Alibaba.\nAsk: What should you consider during the procurement stage? \nTake into consideration customers preferences\nConsider your brand\nConsider your budget\nHow convenient is it to buy this material? \n\nManufacturing and operations– We are not manufacturing anything because we pre-order from China, but we need to package and label all the products to prepare for shipping to the customers. This will happen in the office you rented with your small team. \nAsk: What should you consider during the manufacturing and operations stage? \nManage time limits and employees\nComplete all tasks on time and with high quality\nClean up and prepare for continued work\n\nLogistics and transportation – We need to store and ship all the mugs to the customers address. We will store the items in our store. We use a 3rd party delivery company and also sell from our storefront. \nAsk: What should you consider during the logistics and transportation stage? \nHow will your packaging affect storage, transportation, and delivery? \nHow can you ensure timely delivery?\nWhere will you store your product? \nHow will you get the product to your customers? \n\nIkea example: Take the case of Ikea – its ‘Bang’ mug has been redesigned many times to realize shipping cost savings (pictures show first and final versions of the cups). Originally, 864 mugs would fit into a pallet; after redesign a pallet held 1,280 mugs. With a further redesign 2,024 mugs could be held. This act of packaging ingenuity and attention to detail reduced its shipping costs by 60%. In addition, IKEA now owns a huge number of forests so that it controls some areas of its own supply. They use wood from this forest in their own products instead of paying a little bit more for someone else to provide the wood. They are able to profit off of this because they are a huge company and benefit from economies of scale. \n11\n\nSales \nPromotion\nMAP YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN\n45 minutes: Activity\n\n35 minutes: Activity\nNow you will apply this to your business.\nEveryone should map out their supply chain and pinpoint areas that they can create value. \nResearch the raw materials needed to make your product and how these raw materials come together to form the finished product. \nMake sure entrepreneurs have the handout where they can answer the following questions:\nWhat are the raw materials needed for your product? Where are they found?\nWhat are the steps involved in making your product? Where does each step in the production take place?\nWhat energy is needed to produce this product/service? Where does that energy come from?\nWhat kind of transportation, if any, is needed at each stage of the production process, including getting the finished product to your customers? \nFinally, think about how you can add value to either your business or your customers. \nCan you reduce steps?\nCan you control more steps?\nCan you cut costs?\nCan you be more sustainable? \nEtc…\nIf you are having trouble, think about the \"happy path\" of your whole business. Go through each step and think about all the activities that you have to do to run and operate your business. Then, at each activity, think about how you will turn this idea to reality. \nEncourage everyone to think about how they could apply the activity to their business; however, if someone insists that they don’t have a supply chain in any form, have them help someone else work on theirs. \n\n10 minutes: Discussion\nYour supply chain has a big impact on your business, people, and the environment. Some supply chains are completely local, while others have supply chains that are around the world. Every decision you make on how to source, produce, transport, sell your product/materials has an impact. \nAsk: How can you make sure that your supply chain is sustainable, cost effective, and creating a positive impact?\nPotential answers:\nMake sure that each step of your supply chain is sourcing their supplies ethically (don’t use sweatshops, child labor, causing environmental harm, etc…)\nProduce as much as you can locally to reduce transportation costs, CO2 emissions, and provide jobs to the local economy\nCut costs by renegotiating partnerships or cutting out steps all together\nBe more efficient and reduce waste wherever you can\nOptimize inventory and transportation by using systems and data analytics\nImprove functionality by making things easier and saving time\nA more efficient and sustainable supply chain can be a great source of value creation\nYou can cut costs and increase your profitability\nYou can cut costs and pass savings over to your customers, increasing value for them\nYou can create value for customers and stakeholders by being more sustainable and eco friendly\n\nRecap: Inventory, distribution, production, procurement and transportation are some of the key costs that exist in the supply chain. Being able to find ways to minimize them is a recognized competitive advantage, and one way to create a lasting competitive edge.\n\n12\n\n\nRe-evaluate your supply chain and identify at least 3 ways you can create value in your supply chain (reduce costs, streamline processes, track and measure more efficiently)\n\n\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS:\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n14\n]]] and here are the slides attached ",

Introduction & Goal Setting\n\n● Welcome & Introductions\n● Five One Labs & The Incubator\n● Ignite Recap & Goal Setting\"\tThe original module introduced participants to the incubator, provided an overview of Five One Labs, and guided participants through goal-setting for their entrepreneurial journey. The session covered the incubator's structure, support system, and expectations while also recapping prior learnings from the Ignite program. The goal-setting portion focused on SMART goals and personal business objectives.\tThe updated module retains the core structure but integrates sustainability and efficiency concepts into goal-setting and the incubator's framework. It emphasizes how startups can build future-proof businesses by considering risk management, efficiency, and sustainability from the start. The new version introduces green business principles into business modeling, risk identification, and operational planning.\t\"- Shift in focus: Incorporates sustainability and efficiency into goal-setting.\n- Future-proofing Startups: Highlights resilience, risk mitigation, and efficiency strategies that benefit all businesses.\n- Expanded Business Strategy: Introduces sustainability as part of business model planning.\n- Value-Based Decision Making: Encourages entrepreneurs to align their goals with sustainable and ethical business practices.\n- New Learning Outcomes: Participants now explore how sustainability impacts financial resilience and market competitiveness.\"\t\t\n1\tWhen mapping the customer journey, touchpoints where sustainable practices can be showcased and/or where customer satisfaction might drop due to sustainability-related issues can be included as part of the CJM exercise.\tIncubator\t\"2. Intro to UX\n\n● Reflect on CJM and why it is important.\n● Map out the ideal customer journey or “happy path” for your business.\n● Identify areas of opportunity that we will use when developing your business model.\"\tThe original module focused on Customer Journey Mapping (CJM) as a tool to understand user experiences and optimize the business process. The \"happy path\" concept was used to streamline customer interactions and make businesses more efficient. It primarily emphasized user experience, convenience, and conversion optimization. Activities helped entrepreneurs design simplified customer journeys to improve business success.\tThe updated module retains the core structure but integrates sustainability by considering customer values alongside their needs. It introduces the concept of value-aligned user journeys, where purchasing decisions reflect ethical, environmental, and sustainable considerations. The idea of a \"truly happy path\" now includes minimizing waste, ethical sourcing, and supporting local economies. Activities encourage entrepreneurs to design customer experiences that highlight sustainable choices.\t\"- Shift from purely optimizing efficiency to incorporating values-driven decision-making.\n- Added discussions on how customers balance convenience with sustainability (e.g., eco-friendly packaging, ethical sourcing).\n- Introduced \"\"Value-Informed Happy Paths\"\" to highlight different customer preferences (e.g., fast delivery vs. sustainable options).\n- Integrated activities exploring how design choices influence consumer behavior toward greener alternatives.\n- Adjusted facilitator notes to prompt deeper discussions on sustainability and ethical decision-making.\"\t\t\n1\t\tIncubator\t\"3. BMC\n\n● Understand the various parts of the Business Model Canvas (BMC).\n● Fill in the parts of your own business model.\n● Identify assumptions you are making about your business model.\"\tThe original version introduced participants to the BMC, focusing on understanding its components and applying it to their businesses. The session included explanation, discussions, and hands-on exercises to fill in the canvas, with emphasis on assumptions and mapping risks. It covered value propositions, customer segments, channels, revenue streams, and cost structures. The approach was structured but did not incorporate sustainability or risk mitigation from an environmental perspective.\tThe updated version integrates sustainability considerations into the BMC by encouraging participants to explore how green business principles can enhance efficiency, reduce risk, and create long-term value. It introduces sustainable revenue models, eco-conscious customer segments, and resource-efficient cost structures. The module now includes examples of green business models, sustainable partnerships, and a discussion on how sustainability reduces financial and operational risks. The implementation phase involves participants identifying how their business can integrate green strategies.\t\"- Integration of sustainability principles into every component of the BMC, renaming it as a \"\"Sustainable Business Model.\"\"\n- New focus on risk mitigation by incorporating environmental, regulatory, and resource-related risks.\n- Expanded discussion on green revenue models, such as carbon credits, sustainable product pricing, and circular economy models.\n- Examples of eco-conscious customer segments and how businesses can position themselves in green markets.\n- Sustainable cost structure analysis, encouraging participants to consider energy efficiency, waste reduction, and long-term cost savings.\n- Resilience-focused discussions on how values-driven investments (sustainability and efficiency) can reduce risks and increase long-term profitability.\n- Stronger emphasis on business assumptions and risk assessment, incorporating discussions on supply chain disruptions, climate change risks, and material scarcity.\n- The update ensures that sustainability is not treated as a separate concept but rather as an integral part of business modeling.\n- It aligns with global trends and funding opportunities that prioritize green businesses.\n- It helps participants future-proof their businesses by considering environmental risks and market shifts towards sustainable solutions.\n- Encourages entrepreneurs to see sustainability as a competitive advantage rather than a cost burden.\"\t\t\n1\t\"Here is a place to consider some green elements? For ex, if a physical product (or wrapping/packaging etc) is part of the prototype, choice of material can be considered, as can energy consumption etc.\nYou can also use as reference the Greening Checklist in p.25 ‘Green Business Booklet’, and overall use as reference p. 21-26 in the booklet.\"\tIncubator\t\"4. Prototyping\n\n● Understand why prototyping is essential to product development.\n● Review the different types of prototypes to create a prototyping plan.\n● Create your first prototypes!\"\tThe original version introduced prototyping as an essential step in the design thinking process. It covered different types of prototypes, their importance, and case studies of successful and failed prototyping efforts. The focus was primarily on testing assumptions, learning through iteration, and progressing product development through prototyping.\tThe updated version retains the core prototyping concepts but integrates sustainability principles. It introduces resource efficiency, cost minimization, and environmental considerations into the prototyping process. The update also includes case studies emphasizing sustainable design thinking, such as the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Iraq, and new examples like the failure of the QOWA project, which lacked incremental development and user-centered design.\t\"- Sustainability Integration: Introduces optimization of resources, waste minimization, and green business strategies into prototyping.\n- New Case Studies: Added real-world examples from UNDP and QOWA to illustrate sustainable and unsustainable prototyping approaches.\n- Risk Mitigation Focus: More emphasis on how prototyping can reduce material waste and prevent costly investments in unsustainable designs.\n- Trade-Offs in Prototyping Choices: Introduces a framework for balancing cost, time, material efficiency, and risk reduction in prototyping methods.\n- Business Efficiency Considerations: Encourages entrepreneurs to use a sustainability checklist when making prototyping decisions to ensure long-term resilience.\"\t\t\n1\t\tIncubator\t\"9. Cost Model\n\n● Break down the different types of business costs.\n● Forecast ongoing business costs.\n● Build out the next step of your P&L statement.\"\tThe original module focused on breaking down business costs, calculating Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and forecasting ongoing business expenses to build a Profit & Loss (P&L) statement. It primarily covered types of costs, unit economics, salaries, and selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses through structured lectures, discussions, and hands-on financial modeling. The module emphasized financial sustainability but did not explicitly incorporate environmental considerations.\tThe updated module retains the core financial cost principles while integrating sustainability-focused efficiency strategies. It introduces Strategic Efficiency Investments, connecting cost savings with long-term financial benefits from energy efficiency (e.g., solar panels, LED lighting, water conservation). The Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW) now includes an Action Plan to identify cost reduction strategies through sustainable choices. A Resource Efficiency Discussion has been embedded in SG&A to encourage businesses to consider investments in energy-efficient operations.\t\"- Strategic Efficiency Investments: Added content on sustainability-driven cost reduction strategies, such as using solar energy, LED lighting, and water-saving technologies to lower operational costs over time.\n- Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW): Entrepreneurs now assess and plan for efficiency-driven investments, aligning cost management with environmental impact reduction.\n- Risk Mitigation & Green Funding: Introduced a risk assessment tool linking sustainability to business resilience (e.g., high electricity costs, supply chain vulnerabilities). The session now discusses potential green funding opportunities (e.g., UNDP Iraq grants for solar projects).\n- Operational Efficiency in SG&A: Expanded SG&A section to include resource efficiency strategies, encouraging businesses to optimize workspace energy use, streamline supply chains, and implement waste reduction strategies.\n- Sustainability Framing in Cost Analysis: Costs are framed as reflections of business values, encouraging entrepreneurs to align financial decisions with long-term sustainability goals (e.g., bulk purchasing vs. waste reduction strategies).\"\t\t\n1\tHere you can include if additional investments would be required to “green” the processes (e.g. solar energy in facilities, LED lights, special packaging material, environmental certifications, etc.) and considering long-term savings because of these investments.\tIncubator\t\"10. Balance Sheet\n\n● Include your start-up budget in your finances.\n● Get to know the balance sheet and begin making one.\n● Understand how finances change with investments or loans.\"\tThe original module focused on basic financial modeling, teaching participants to develop a balance sheet, understand assets and liabilities, and integrate startup costs. It walked through profit and loss concepts, financial forecasting, capital and operational expenditures, and balance sheet adjustments due to loans and investments. The emphasis was on standard business finance and ensuring participants grasped financial health indicators.\tThe updated module retains the core financial modeling content but integrates sustainability principles, particularly resource efficiency and risk mitigation. It introduces sustainable CAPEX/OPEX strategies, highlights investments that reduce long-term operational costs (e.g., solar panels, efficient HVAC, water conservation systems), and links financial decision-making to climate resilience. Participants also assess the ROI of green investments and their impact on financial stability.\t\"- Integration of sustainability concepts into financial decision-making – Green CAPEX/OPEX differentiation and examples (solar, energy efficiency). \n- Focus on long-term financial resilience – Highlighting cost-saving benefits of sustainable investments and their impact on financial statements. \n- New sustainability-focused financial tools – Added ROI calculator for green investments, linking depreciation schedules to efficiency savings. \n- Expanded risk management perspective – Introducing regulatory and climate-related financial risks.\"\t\t\n1\tHere, looking at the full life cycle of the products or services, you can for example look at opportunities to provide awareness or relevant environmental information to customers, or integrate concepts for example or circular economy business models that support extending the lifecycle of products and services (e.g. providing support for repairing products so that they can last longer, or take-back programs where the business take responsibility for their products at their end of life by collecting used products or materials from consumers and ensuring they are properly managed (reused, recycled, etc.)\tIncubator\t\"11. Service Design\n\n● Examine the various layers of your product or service.\n● Understand what goes into good service.\n● Identify opportunities to provide great service to your customers.\"\tThe original version introduced service design principles, emphasizing customer experience through layers of a product (core benefit, actual product, additional services). It covered defining good service, evaluating service elements, and service blueprinting. The session included examples like Duolingo and a tourism agency, exploring customer interactions and service delivery models.\tThe updated version retains the core structure but integrates sustainability considerations at multiple points. A new \"Enduring Value\" layer was added to the product framework, addressing long-term service impacts, circular economy principles, and sustainability longevity. A case study on Al-Eiz Takeaway Kitchen in Iraq demonstrates a socially sustainable business model. The service design mapping now includes efficiency improvements to reduce waste and operational resource use.\t\"- Added sustainability integration through the new \"\"Enduring Value\"\" concept, highlighting product/service longevity, maintenance, and circular economy strategies.\n- Case study inclusion (Al-Eiz Kitchen in Iraq) to illustrate social sustainability, local sourcing, and community impact.\n- Service blueprinting expanded to include sustainability-related operational efficiencies and waste reduction.\n- After-sales service was revised to include maintenance programs and customer guidance on prolonging product life.\n- The session now frames customer experience as linked to sustainable business practices, encouraging participants to embed sustainability into their service offerings.\"\t\t\n1\tAlongside branding (#8), marketing and comms is a place to take into consideration green elements. Might it be an advantage to opt for being the ‘green solution’ in the market, to carve out a niche compared to potential competitors (ie. if they have not gone green)\tIncubator\t\"14.

Business Ethics\n\n● Establish a clear understanding of what business ethics is.\n● Identify ways to include the triple bottom line into your business model\n● Formulate a plan to create and measure impact.\"\tThe original module covered basic ethical principles in business, distinguishing between compliance-based and values-based ethics. It introduced the Triple Bottom Line (People, Planet, Profit) and discussed the importance of ethical business decisions. Key activities included stakeholder analysis, impact measurement, and discussions on corporate responsibility, Unilever’s purpose-driven brand strategy, and real-world examples like Chobani Yogurt and Starbucks' hiring policies. The session ended with an introduction to the B Impact Assessment.\tThe updated module reframes business ethics as Living Values That Ignite Business, emphasizing the why behind ethical choices rather than just compliance. Discussions now focus on how authenticity provides a competitive advantage and how businesses can build resilience through ethical commitments. The role of sustainability is expanded, incorporating discussions on greenwashing, circular economy models, and certifications (ISO, Fair Trade, LEED, B Corp) as ways to embed ethical and sustainable practices beyond marketing. The Unilever case study remains but is linked more explicitly to sustainability. A new section analyzing McDonald's European sustainability shift provides a critical lens on ethical branding. The session still concludes with an impact measurement activity but now emphasizes measuring sustainability impact as a core part of business ethics.\t\"- Shift from Compliance to Authenticity & Purpose: Ethics is reframed not just as following rules but as a strategic advantage for long-term success and resilience.\n- Stronger Sustainability Integration: The updated module embeds sustainability deeply into ethical business discussions, particularly through circular economy practices, ethical certifications, and greenwashing critiques.\n- Expanded Stakeholder Consideration: Now explicitly links business ethics to environmental impact and future generations (aligning with intergenerational equity).\n- Practical Application of Ethics in Business Strategy: The update moves beyond theoretical discussion by linking ethics to real-world business resilience, investor trust, and competitive advantage.\n- Critical Analysis of Greenwashing: The module now challenges entrepreneurs to differentiate real sustainability commitments from marketing tactics through case studies like McDonald’s.\"\t\t\n1\tConsider mapping if there are any available special funds or other incentives targeted for “green” businesses in the area.

Risk and Crisis Management\n\n● Reflect on your decision-making style, and pinpoint strengths and weaknesses.\n● Set an initial risk management strategy and learn how to adapt it over time.\n● Learn a few strategies to adapt when you are in a crisis.\"\tThe original module focused on understanding decision-making styles, basic risk management strategies, and crisis response. It included an interactive Plane Crash Activity to help participants analyze their decision-making processes and group dynamics. The risk management section introduced basic risk identification, assessment, and mitigation techniques. Crisis management emphasized adapting to unexpected events and managing uncertainty.\tThe updated module retains the interactive decision-making exercise but integrates business-specific risk categories (e.g., power outages, supply chain issues). Risk management now includes adaptability to changing circumstances, such as climate impacts and market shifts. The module integrates efficiency and sustainability principles, encouraging participants to assess risks through a resilience framework. Crisis management introduces systematic crisis response planning and innovation-based adaptation strategies.\t\"- Sustainability Integration: Expanded risk categories to include environmental and supply chain resilience.\n- Efficiency & Risk Planning: Introduced the Risk Category Worksheet and Business Efficiency Workbook to help entrepreneurs preemptively address risks.\n- Business Resilience Focus: Encouraged proactive crisis management through adaptive decision-making and scenario planning rather than reactive approaches.\n- Practical Application: Expanded risk assessment tools and connected risk management strategies with business efficiency planning.\n- Green and Climate Risk Awareness: Addressed climate-related disruptions and sustainable business strategies.\"\t\t\n1\tHere you might consider doing a bit of research on what government policies (national, regional) and incentive schemes exist for supporting green businesses\tIncubator\t\"31.

At least in the longer run. Here you can introduce the concept of what a green business is and how it can support accessing “green” markets and enhance competitiveness (e.g. by increasing resource efficiency, reducing vulnerability to climate change, etc.). . You can also add more information about green markets in Iraq, e.g. on solar energy, water efficiency systems, energy efficiency, etc. Or on changes in demand for green products.

Or ideas could be ‘filtered’ using some green criteria.... See ‘Green Business Booklet’ page 30 (annex 2) for examples of ‘Innovative Green Business Ideas’. Another idea could be to add a “thematic brainstorming” focused on creative solutions to the most pressing environmental challenges in Iraq. See (See p.12 ‘Green Business Booklet’)\tIgnite\t\"6. Creativity and Ideation\n\n● Rapid brainstorming (what if?)\n● Idea filtration\n● Challenging assumption\"\tThe original module focused on creativity and ideation through the Design Thinking process. It guided participants through defining problem statements, brainstorming, challenging assumptions, and selecting ideas. It emphasized techniques like \"How Might We\" (HMW) statements, rapid brainstorming, and structured ideation exercises (e.g., $0 vs. $100M solutions, Google-inspired brainstorming). The session concluded with idea selection methods like dot voting and the \"Now, How, Wow\" matrix.\tThe updated module retains the core structure but integrates sustainability and resource efficiency principles. Participants are encouraged to consider green innovation opportunities, cost and resource efficiency, and the business value of sustainability. Ideation techniques now prompt learners to explore how sustainable practices can enhance business competitiveness and reduce risks. The \"What If\" brainstorming method includes environmental constraints (e.g., \"What if supply costs double?\" \"What if resources become scarce?\"). Idea selection now includes sustainability criteria such as resource optimization and waste reduction.\t\"- Sustainability Lens in Ideation: Brainstorming prompts now encourage participants to think about waste reduction, energy efficiency, and eco-friendly innovations as competitive advantages.\n- Efficiency and Risk Mitigation: Added emphasis on resource efficiency in ideation, exploring how green solutions lower costs and future-proof businesses.\n- Green Innovation Opportunities: Encourages participants to integrate local materials, circular economy principles, and environmental regulations in their ideation process.\n- Updated Idea Selection: Idea evaluation now considers resource efficiency, environmental impact, and long-term business viability alongside traditional feasibility and profitability.\n- Framing Sustainability as an Opportunity: Rather than a separate “green” module, sustainability is embedded as a strategic business advantage, applicable to all participants.\"\tIgnite 6. Creativity and Ideation - Business Viability Matrix\t\n1\tDepending on how deep you want the integration of climate/environment aspects, you could here add the option of integrating surveys/interviews to understand how climate change is impacting users’ lives and how this influences their needs, behaviors and attitudes. Or also consider integrating questions to understand how important sustainability and environmental concerns are to users and how it influences their behavior and attitudes towards “green” products or services.\tIgnite\t\"5.

Business Ethics\n\n● Establish a clear understanding of what business ethics is.\n● Identify ways to include the triple bottom line into your business model\n● Formulate a plan to create and measure impact.\"\tThe original module covered basic ethical principles in business, distinguishing between compliance-based and values-based ethics. It introduced the Triple Bottom Line (People, Planet, Profit) and discussed the importance of ethical business decisions. Key activities included stakeholder analysis, impact measurement, and discussions on corporate responsibility, Unilever’s purpose-driven brand strategy, and real-world examples like Chobani Yogurt and Starbucks' hiring policies. The session ended with an introduction to the B Impact Assessment.\tThe updated module reframes business ethics as Living Values That Ignite Business, emphasizing the why behind ethical choices rather than just compliance. Discussions now focus on how authenticity provides a competitive advantage and how businesses can build resilience through ethical commitments. The role of sustainability is expanded, incorporating discussions on greenwashing, circular economy models, and certifications (ISO, Fair Trade, LEED, B Corp) as ways to embed ethical and sustainable practices beyond marketing. The Unilever case study remains but is linked more explicitly to sustainability. A new section analyzing McDonald's European sustainability shift provides a critical lens on ethical branding. The session still concludes with an impact measurement activity but now emphasizes measuring sustainability impact as a core part of business ethics.\t\"- Shift from Compliance to Authenticity & Purpose: Ethics is reframed not just as following rules but as a strategic advantage for long-term success and resilience.\n- Stronger Sustainability Integration: The updated module embeds sustainability deeply into ethical business discussions, particularly through circular economy practices, ethical certifications, and greenwashing critiques.\n- Expanded Stakeholder Consideration: Now explicitly links business ethics to environmental impact and future generations (aligning with intergenerational equity).\n- Practical Application of Ethics in Business Strategy: The update moves beyond theoretical discussion by linking ethics to real-world business resilience, investor trust, and competitive advantage.\n- Critical Analysis of Greenwashing: The module now challenges entrepreneurs to differentiate real sustainability commitments from marketing tactics through case studies like McDonald’s.\"\t\t\n1\tConsider mapping if there are any available special funds or other incentives targeted for “green” businesses in the area.

Risk and Crisis Management\n\n● Reflect on your decision-making style, and pinpoint strengths and weaknesses.\n● Set an initial risk management strategy and learn how to adapt it over time.\n● Learn a few strategies to adapt when you are in a crisis.\"\tThe original module focused on understanding decision-making styles, basic risk management strategies, and crisis response. It included an interactive Plane Crash Activity to help participants analyze their decision-making processes and group dynamics. The risk management section introduced basic risk identification, assessment, and mitigation techniques. Crisis management emphasized adapting to unexpected events and managing uncertainty.\tThe updated module retains the interactive decision-making exercise but integrates business-specific risk categories (e.g., power outages, supply chain issues). Risk management now includes adaptability to changing circumstances, such as climate impacts and market shifts. The module integrates efficiency and sustainability principles, encouraging participants to assess risks through a resilience framework. Crisis management introduces systematic crisis response planning and innovation-based adaptation strategies.\t\"- Sustainability Integration: Expanded risk categories to include environmental and supply chain resilience.\n- Efficiency & Risk Planning: Introduced the Risk Category Worksheet and Business Efficiency Workbook to help entrepreneurs preemptively address risks.\n- Business Resilience Focus: Encouraged proactive crisis management through adaptive decision-making and scenario planning rather than reactive approaches.\n- Practical Application: Expanded risk assessment tools and connected risk management strategies with business efficiency planning.\n- Green and Climate Risk Awareness: Addressed climate-related disruptions and sustainable business strategies.\"\t\t\n1\tHere you might consider doing a bit of research on what government policies (national, regional) and incentive schemes exist for supporting green businesses\tIncubator\t\"31. Investment in the Middle East\n\n● Go over some entrepreneurship and tech trends around the world and in the MENA region.\n● Identify challenges and opportunities in the region and place your business in the current context.\n● Discuss the different key actors in the region and brainstorm ways to work with the current players.\"\tThe original module covered the entrepreneurial landscape in MENA, focusing on trends, challenges, and opportunities in Iraq, investment dynamics, success stories, key players, and investor relations.

At least in the longer run. Here you can introduce the concept of what a green business is and how it can support accessing “green” markets and enhance competitiveness (e.g. by increasing resource efficiency, reducing vulnerability to climate change, etc.). . You can also add more information about green markets in Iraq, e.g. on solar energy, water efficiency systems, energy efficiency, etc. Or on changes in demand for green products.

Or ideas could be ‘filtered’ using some green criteria.... See ‘Green Business Booklet’ page 30 (annex 2) for examples of ‘Innovative Green Business Ideas’. Another idea could be to add a “thematic brainstorming” focused on creative solutions to the most pressing environmental challenges in Iraq. See (See p.12 ‘Green Business Booklet’)\tIgnite\t\"6. Creativity and Ideation\n\n● Rapid brainstorming (what if?)\n● Idea filtration\n● Challenging assumption\"\tThe original module focused on creativity and ideation through the Design Thinking process. It guided participants through defining problem statements, brainstorming, challenging assumptions, and selecting ideas. It emphasized techniques like \"How Might We\" (HMW) statements, rapid brainstorming, and structured ideation exercises (e.g., $0 vs. $100M solutions, Google-inspired brainstorming). The session concluded with idea selection methods like dot voting and the \"Now, How, Wow\" matrix.\tThe updated module retains the core structure but integrates sustainability and resource efficiency principles. Participants are encouraged to consider green innovation opportunities, cost and resource efficiency, and the business value of sustainability. Ideation techniques now prompt learners to explore how sustainable practices can enhance business competitiveness and reduce risks. The \"What If\" brainstorming method includes environmental constraints (e.g., \"What if supply costs double?\" \"What if resources become scarce?\"). Idea selection now includes sustainability criteria such as resource optimization and waste reduction.\t\"- Sustainability Lens in Ideation: Brainstorming prompts now encourage participants to think about waste reduction, energy efficiency, and eco-friendly innovations as competitive advantages.\n- Efficiency and Risk Mitigation: Added emphasis on resource efficiency in ideation, exploring how green solutions lower costs and future-proof businesses.\n- Green Innovation Opportunities: Encourages participants to integrate local materials, circular economy principles, and environmental regulations in their ideation process.\n- Updated Idea Selection: Idea evaluation now considers resource efficiency, environmental impact, and long-term business viability alongside traditional feasibility and profitability.\n- Framing Sustainability as an Opportunity: Rather than a separate “green” module, sustainability is embedded as a strategic business advantage, applicable to all participants.\"\tIgnite 6. Creativity and Ideation - Business Viability Matrix\t\n1\tDepending on how deep you want the integration of climate/environment aspects, you could here add the option of integrating surveys/interviews to understand how climate change is impacting users’ lives and how this influences their needs, behaviors and attitudes. Or also consider integrating questions to understand how important sustainability and environmental concerns are to users and how it influences their behavior and attitudes towards “green” products or services.\tIgnite\t\"5. Reframe\n\n● Analyze user research\n● Custom journey steps and map\n● Build your business\"\tFocused on analyzing user research through user personas and customer journey maps (CJM).

Here are some tips on what to ask in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of a user interview:\r\n\r\nBeginning: In the beginning of the interview, you should ask opening questions to set people at ease and build rapport. You should not ask about sensitive topics. Instead, focus on setting the stage and bringing your interviewees on board so they’re comfortable enough to be, and remain, open with you. What you do at this stage can include the following:\r\nTelling participants what topics will be covered\r\nTelling participants how their data will be used\r\nAsking innocuous questions such as what their role is in their organization\r\nAsking concrete questions that are easy to answer\r\n\r\nMiddle: In the middle of the interview, you’re hitting high gear. Having established a direct channel with your interviewees (the users), you move on and ask the bulk of your questions, but maybe not in the order you had originally planned. Remember to:\r\nKeep the flow of the conversation as natural as possible, but cover the topics you want to cover.\r\nPick up on what participants have said earlier and get full replies to questions they have only partially answered.\r\nSteer participants back on track if they go too far off topic.\r\nShow that you have been listening.\r\nGo deeper where necessary\r\n\r\nEnd: At the end of the interview, you wrap up in a way that makes participants feel as though they have said what they wanted to say and that their answers are valuable. By this point, you will have managed to tie up any loose ends on matters that had not been clear before, and both you and they should be satisfied that the interview has brought all the issues out into the open. Things you should do include:\r\nAsking if there is anything participants would like to add.\r\nTelling your participants what you are going to do with their data and what the value is for them.\r\nThanking them for taking the time to help with your research. Above all, remember to conduct a pilot study before you start approaching real-life participants and tackling ‘organic’ interview settings. Also, always be sensitive to the fact that people are different and need different things!\r\"\t\"Effective Questions:\n- \"\"Tell me about your decision-making process...\"\"\n- \"\"What matters most when choosing [product/service]?\"\"\n- \"\"What challenges do you face with current solutions?\"\"\n- \"\"How do you evaluate different options?\"\"\n\nAvoid:\n- Leading questions about specific features\n- Yes/no questions about purchasing\n- Questions that assume user needs\nFacilitator Notes:\n\nFocus on open-ended questions that reveal genuine insights\nLet participants develop questions relevant to their business\nIf efficiency or cost topics arise, explore naturally\nTime: 10 minutes practice\nEncourage questions that uncover real user needs and behaviors\"\n\t17\t17\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\t\"SAYS: “I love Asiacell because I never have a bad experience.”\n“I want something reliable.”\n“I don’t understand what to do from here.”\n\nTHINKS: “This is really annoying.”\r\n“Am I dumb for not understanding this?”\r\n\nDOES: Refreshes page several times.\r\nShops around to compare prices.\r\n\nFEELS: Impatient: pages load too slowly\r\nConfused: too many contradictory prices\r\nWorried: they are doing something wrong\"\t\"SAYS:\n\"\"I need something reliable\"\"\n\"\"Price is important but so is quality\"\"\n\"\"I want something that lasts\"\"\n\nTHINKS:\n\"\"Is this worth the investment?\"\"\n\"\"Will this solve my problem?\"\"\n\"\"Can I trust this solution?\"\"\n\nDOES:\nCompares options\nResearches before buying\nAsks others for recommendations\n\nFEELS:\nConcerned about making right choice\nWants value for money\nSeeks reliable solutions\n\nFacilitator Notes:\n\nKeep focus on understanding genuine user perspectives\nEncourage deep understanding of user decision-making\nAllow cost and reliability discussions to emerge naturally\nTime: 8 minutes brainstorming\nUse examples relevant to local context\"\n\t19\t19\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\tWhen conducting user interviews, make sure to include extreme users. Who are the people who use this product every day?\tWhen conducting user interviews, make sure to include extreme users, including those who prioritize in their decisions or face resource challenges. Who are the people who use this product every day?\n\t19\t19\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\tWhile creating your user research plan, make sure to include extreme users!\tWhile creating your user research plan, make sure to include extreme users! Eco-conscious buyers and those affected by resource constraints often offer unique insights.....\n\t19\t19\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\t\"For example, if you are making a new cleat, you definitely want to talk to people who play sports (kids, parents who buy them, university students, etc…), but you would probably want to talk to people who LIVE in cleats too. Take professional athletes for example, they know every part of their shoes because they wear them for hours every day. They know about what they love and hate about them. \r\nLet’s take another example. If we were designing a new type of seat in a car, who would the extreme user be? --- allow them to answer. Taxi drivers live in their cars. All day long they are sitting in the seats and probably know really specific details of what makes them comfortable or not.

If we want them to know about the product/value offered, we use different channels to reach them. Once we have reached the customer segments, we want to build relationships with them to get them coming back. Delivering value to your customers allows you to make sales and bring in revenue (maybe they even bring friends along). \r\nWhere have you seen this before? \r\nThis is what they did during Ignite!\r\nYou should have a clear picture of your customers, what they care about, how to reach them, and have an idea of how you will actually make money through this interaction. \r\n\r\nMove on to the left side:\r\nNext let’s look at all the key activities you need to do in order to make this a reality. You need to put in work and resources to build and deliver the value you promised to your customers. There are a lot of activities and resources that go into the consistent delivery of value to your customers (running your business). You usually can’t do it all yourself. In this case, you need to find the right partners to help you achieve your tasks. These partners can help by providing resources (human, financial, etc…) or by taking responsibility for some key activities. All of this costs money to do. \r\n\r\nConclusion: In the next slides, we are going to go point by point on the BMC to understand it more. We will discuss the different parts as a group and go over an example. After that, there will be time to apply it to your business. Keep in mind that this session will stay fairly high level for now.

How do we get them? \r\nPotential answers:\r\nKey resources are the personnel, tools, and budget the team will need access to \r\nEvery business model requires Key Resources. Your resources allow your enterprise to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and earn revenues. \r\nDifferent Key Resources are needed depending on the type of business model (some business need a lot of cash on hand while others need a lot of human resources)\r\nKey resources can be owned or leased by the company or acquired from key partners (including investors).\r\nExamples:\r\nPhysical resources (tangible assets)\r\nFinancial resources (cash), \r\nIntellectual resources\r\nHuman resources. \r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble identifying the right key activities, ask yourself the following:\r\nWhat Key Resources do our Value Propositions require?\r\nOur Distribution Channels?\r\nCustomer Relationships?\r\nRevenue Streams?\r\n\r\n--------\r\nMore details on different common key resources. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\r\n--------\r\nTypes of Key Resources: Key Resources can be categorized as follows:\r\nPhysical: This category includes physical assets such as manufacturing facilities, buildings, vehicles, machines, systems, point-of-sales systems, and distribution networks. Retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon.com rely heavily on physical resources, which are often capital-intensive. The former has an enormous global network of stores and related logistics infrastructure. The latter has an extensive IT, warehouse, and logistics infrastructure.\r\nIntellectual Property: Intellectual property resources such as brands, proprietary knowledge, patents and copyrights, partnerships, and customer databases are increasingly important components of a strong business model. Intellectual property resources are difficult to develop but when successfully created may offer substantial value. Consumer goods companies such as Nike and Sony rely heavily on their brand as a Key Resource. Microsoft and SAP depend on software and related intellectual property developed over many years. Qualcomm, a designer and supplier of chipsets for broadband mobile devices, built its business model around patented microchip designs that earn the company substantial licensing fees.\r\nHuman: Every enterprise requires human resources, but people are particularly prominent in certain business models. For example, human resources are crucial in knowledge-intensive and creative industries. A pharmaceutical company such as Novartis, for example, relies heavily on human resources: its business model is predicated on an army of experienced scientists and a large and skilled sales force.\r\nFinancial: Some business models call for financial resources and/or financial guarantees, such as cash, lines of credit, or a stock option pool for hiring key employees. Ericsson, the telecom manufacturer, provides an example of financial resource leverage within a business model. Ericsson may opt to borrow funds from banks and capital markets, then use a portion of the proceeds to provide vendor financing to equipment customers, thus ensuring that orders are placed with Ericsson rather than competitors.\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Discussion (5 minutes)\r\nPrompt:\r\nWhat are key resources? How do we get them?\r\nPotential answers:\r\nKey resources are the personnel, tools, and budget the team will need access to.\r\nEvery business model requires Key Resources—these enable an enterprise to:\r\nCreate and offer a Value Proposition\r\nReach markets and maintain Customer Relationships\r\nGenerate Revenue Streams\r\nDifferent businesses rely on different types of key resources.\r\nSome require high cash flow (e.g., retail, manufacturing).\r\nOthers rely on skilled human resources (e.g., consulting, software development).\r\nKey resources can be owned, leased, or acquired from key partners (e.g., investors, suppliers, collaborators).\r\n\r\nRefining the Discussion with Values & Resilience Considerations\r\nExpand the conversation beyond traditional resources by integrating values-aligned resources:\r\nHow do your key resources align with your values?\r\nExample: Tech company deciding between high-speed but energy-intensive servers vs. solar-powered servers.\r\nWhich resources are most vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, price volatility, or regulation changes?\r\nExample: Businesses that relied on non-renewable materials saw supply chain delays during COVID.\r\nMitigation: Consider sustainable alternatives that increase stability and reduce long-term costs.\r\nHow could prioritizing sustainability or ethical sourcing make your business more resilient?\r\nExample: Fair-trade coffee brands secure long-term supplier loyalty, ensuring stable pricing.\r\n\r\nKey Resource Categories & Considerations\r\n1. Physical Resources:\r\nFacilities, buildings, vehicles, hardware, logistics networks\r\nValues Lens: Are these resources energy-efficient, responsibly sourced, or adaptable?\r\nExample: A logistics company using fuel-efficient vehicles to reduce costs and emissions.\r\n2. Intellectual Property (IP):\r\nBrand identity, patents, proprietary technology, databases, algorithms\r\nValues Lens: Are these resources accessible, open-source, or ethically developed?\r\nExample: Open-source software companies that enable collaboration while maintaining a revenue model.\r\n3. Human Resources:\r\nEmployees, contractors, advisors\r\nValues Lens: Are hiring, retention, and training practices equitable, ethical, and inclusive?\r\nExample: Businesses that provide fair wages and growth opportunities retain employees longer.\r\n4. Financial Resources:\r\nCapital, investments, revenue streams\r\nValues Lens: Is funding aligned with the company’s mission? Are there ethical finance models?\r\nExample: A sustainable brand choosing impact investors over venture capital for long-term alignment.\r\n\r\nActivity – Resource Resilience Mapping (10 minutes)\r\nGoal: Help participants assess their resources beyond traditional needs—considering values, resilience, and efficiency.\r\nList Your Resources: Identify the key resources required for business success.\r\nAssess Their Alignment: Are these resources chosen for cost, speed, sustainability, ethics, or resilience?\r\nRisk Assessment:\r\nWhich resources are most vulnerable to price fluctuations, shortages, or regulatory changes?\r\nCan alternatives improve stability? (e.g., renewable energy, local sourcing)\r\nValues Integration:\r\nHow could sustainability, ethics, or durability enhance long-term success?\r\nExample: If using imported raw materials, could switching to local suppliers reduce risk and support community businesses?\r\nReflection: Discuss findings with a partner or small group—what surprised them?

Explain the elements of the document:\r\nPrimary goal: Choose specific and measurable goals that you hope to attain with your marketing efforts, and note them on your one page marketing plan.\r\nAction plan: Strategies very generally state how you plan to reach your goals. For example, if your goal is to increase listeners of your podcast by 3,000 in a year, an example strategy might be to invite well-known people in your industry to be guests on the show. You might also want to have a digital marketing campaign highlighting all those guests on your podcast to get the word out.\r\nTotal cost to implement the plan: Make sure you consider the cost to implement the plan.

A green focus could mean:\r\n Solving environmental problems in your community (e.g., reducing waste or energy use, see Green Business Booklet p. 12).\r\n Using efficient processes or eco-friendly products to lower costs and appeal to customers (Green Business Booklet p. 16).\r\n Highlighting these strengths to attract investors who care about sustainability or long-term resilience.\r\n\r\nAsk: How could a green focus (if it fits your business) give you an edge? For example, could it save money, tap into new markets, or align with your values?\r\n\r\nPoint them to the “Green Ideas Brainstorm” handout (based on Green Business Booklet p. 12 questions like “What environmental problems exist in your community?” and “What resources could you use?”).

Some questions you might want to ask to encourage discussion include:\r\nCan someone tell me what they know about ethics?\r\nWhat do ethics look like in the business context? What are ethics in business? \r\nHow are business ethics and high ethical standards linked to business sustainability?\r\nWho are all of the people impacted by your business (stakeholders)? Why is it important to take care of them?\r\n\r\nSome of these points probably came up in the discussion. Maybe someone mentioned following the law as a part of ethics. Or not, so you can bring it up now. \r\nBasically, there are 2 types of ethics:\r\nCompliance based: This is doing the bare minimum. You follow the laws and do what you are supposed to do. The idea here is not to do any harm. However, sometimes the laws might not be perfect and still do harm. This is difficult because laws are different in different locations because of cultural differences. What might not be ethical in some cultures (child labor for instance), are perfectly accepted in other places in the world. \r\nDo no harm (hopefully)\r\nFollow laws\r\nFollow guidelines provided by an organization or group telling you what you can and can’t do. \r\nPenalties for violations\r\n\r\nValues based: Because laws aren’t perfect, they leave room for businesses to damage people, communities, and the environment. Based on personal choices and values (without disregarding logical business rationale), you can choose to have your business have a positive impact on society. It takes a bit of extra work, but your business will have an impact on so many people. Some people might argue that you have a moral duty to do good with your business. \r\nDo good. Do more than the minimum legal requirements and expectations to do what you think is right. \r\nCompany core values. Act with your company core values in mind.\r\nSelf regulation. Hold yourself accountable and do good even when nobody’s watching.\r\nExtra effort. Put in a little extra effort to be the best version of your business that can possibly exist.\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Kickoff (2-3 minutes):\r\n\"\"Let's discuss ethics as a foundation for aligning your business with authenticity, purpose, and resilience. Ethics aren’t just rules to follow—they represent your deeper 'why' and drive your business forward, especially in challenging times.\"\"\r\nDiscussion Questions (10 minutes):\r\nWhen someone says 'ethics,' what's the first thing that comes to your mind?\r\nHow can authenticity provide your business with unique advantages that competitors can't easily replicate?\r\nWhat impact does alignment with a founder's deepest values have on business success?\r\nCan you recall a moment when you felt genuinely alive and motivated by your work? How can that kind of energy enhance business performance?\r\nHave you seen examples where businesses succeeded specifically because they stayed true to their core values? What happened?\r\nWho are the stakeholders impacted by your business (customers, employees, local community, environment)? Why does considering their well-being contribute to your long-term success?\r\nEncourage participants to share real examples—situations where businesses either lost trust by cutting corners or built loyalty by sticking firmly to their values.\r\nAs the conversation progresses, highlight the two fundamental approaches to ethics:\r\nWrap-Up Points (2-3 minutes):\r\n\"\"We've talked about two main pathways businesses can take regarding ethics—Compliance-based and Values-based. Let's briefly explore each:\"\"\r\nCompliance-Based Ethics: Playing Safe\r\nDoing what's legally required—meeting regulations and avoiding penalties.\r\nPrimarily focused on avoiding problems and doing no harm.\r\nLimitations: Laws differ by location, and simply following rules doesn't create deeper connections with customers or employees.\r\nValues-Based Ethics: Igniting Purpose\r\nGoing beyond compliance because you have a meaningful purpose and clear core values.\r\nActing authentically, proactively, and ethically—even when nobody is watching—because your 'why' genuinely drives you.\r\nWillingness to put in extra effort aligned with your values, making your work more purposeful and fulfilling.\r\nWhy Values Ignite Your Business:\r\nCustomer Connection: People support businesses whose values align with theirs. Authenticity builds trust, loyalty, and lasting customer relationships.\r\nTeam Loyalty: Employees remain engaged and motivated when their work serves a meaningful purpose beyond financial compensation.\r\nLong-term Resilience: Businesses guided by strong, clear values can more effectively adapt to challenges and thrive amid uncertainty.\r\nCompetitive Edge: Authenticity differentiates your business clearly and powerfully in crowded markets.\r\nClosing Thought:\r\nWe aren't just building startups—we're cultivating purpose-driven businesses that attract customers, inspire communities, and stand the test of time. Ethics, grounded in authenticity and values, can become your a strategic advantage.\r\nAs Epictetus famously said:\r\n\"\"First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to.\"\"\"\n\t-\t4\tAdded New Content\t-\t\"\"\"5 Minutes: Discussion - Ethics: Living Values That Ignite Business Continued\r\nDiscussion Questions (2-3 minutes):\r\nWhat is your strong why?

How can you “activate” the purpose behind your business (instead of just having values that are never worked towards accomplishing)?\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Facilitator Notes (1-2 minutes):\r\nOpen with challenge: \"\"Every business claims values like these on their website. But when do these words actually matter? What makes the difference between empty statements and values that guide real decisions?\"\"\r\nQuick example: McDonald's painted arches green and added salads, claiming environmental values—but their core business remains unchanged\"\"\r\nGo To Slide 10\"\"\"\n\t-\t9\tAdded New Content\t-\t\"\"\"FROM WORDS TO PURPOSE\r\nFacilitator notes:\n\r\nFacilitator Notes (2-3 minutes):\r\nDiscuss: \"\"Think about your stated values.

Things people can see, hear, share. Actions that connect with people, profit, and planet—what we call the triple bottom line. That's where we're headed next.\"\"\"\"\"\n\t11\t14\tUpdated Wording in Slides\t\"\"\"HIGH STANDARDS\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\r\n\r\nSo how do the companies who are doing great legitimate work stand out from the others? Because of case studies like Unilever, being ethical or “green” is trendy now. There are so many people “greenwashing” to get good press to make people think they are doing good so that it will have a positive impact on their sales. \r\nAsk: Where have you seen this before? How are people faking ethics?\r\nGreen packaging or packaging with plants on it. \r\nCompanies that say one thing and do another.\r\nNatural gas/hydraulic fracking companies that advertise “clean” energy (it burns clean, but extracting it is very harmful for the environment).\r\n\r\nAsk: Given the fact that everyone wants to appear ethical, how do you stand out from the others? How do you separate the fakers from the people actually doing good work?\r\nActually do good things with evidence\r\nPut policies and procedures into place and enforce them\r\n3rd party product certifications:\r\nISO\r\nLEEDS certified\r\nOrganic\r\nFair trade\r\nRainforest alliance\r\nB certified\r\nEtc…\r\nHave these standards to avoid greenwashing “marketing”\"\"\"\t\"\"\"LIVING YOUR VALUES, NOT JUST MARKETING THEM\r\n\nFacilitator Notes (5 minutes: Discussion)\r\n\"\"We've talked about finding values that truly matter to you and activating them through the triple bottom line. But in a world where 'ethical' and 'green' have become marketing buzzwords, how do businesses that genuinely live their values stand out from those just wearing the costume?\"\"\r\nTransition: This disconnect between what companies claim and what they do has a name: 'greenwashing' or 'ethics washing.' It happens when values become marketing tools rather than authentic guides for decisions.\r\nAsk: \"\"How can your business demonstrate that your values run deeper than marketing? How do you build trust that your 'why' is genuine?\"\"\r\nGuide toward concrete answers:\r\n\"\"Make choices that might cost you something in the short term but align with your values\"\"\r\n\"\"Be transparent about both your successes and challenges\"\"\r\n\"\"Invite verification through certification programs relevant to your sector:\"\"\r\nISO standards for quality and environmental management\r\nOrganic certification for food products\r\nFair Trade for ethical supply chains\r\nB Corporation certification for overall social and environmental performance\r\n\r\n\r\nConnect back to meaning: The strongest businesses don't just meet standards—they set them based on what truly matters to them. When values come from an authentic source of meaning, customers don't just see compliance—they feel your authentic purpose and builds loyalty that marketing can't buy.\r\nApplication: Now, thinking about your specific business and the values we've been discussing, what's one concrete action you could take this month that would demonstrate your commitment isn't just talk?\"\"\"\n\t12\t15\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\t\"\"\"1 hour and 15 minutes: Activity\r\n\r\nThink about your core values and the ideas we shared before. What will you do to accomplish your mission? How will you really accomplish those things and have an ACTIVATED BRAND PURPOSE? What problem is your business really solving? Think about your customers/employees/community needs and how you can best support them. Based on your mission statement and care values, what are 3 things you want to change in the world? You will create a system to create and measure your impact. You can measure impact in a lot of ways! Feel free to measure anything you want, but make sure you are measuring impact in a way that is aligned with your mission and business! If you are able to track what you are doing, you can make an impact report that would be useful to share with donors, investors, or even put on your website and share with your customers!\r\nWhat we will do now is look at a well known certification assessment that will help you evaluate your impact on all of the different stakeholders. \r\n\r\n1 hour: Activity\r\nFor the rest of the session, take each of these categories and list how you can impact each of these stakeholder groups. \r\nTake a B Impact Assessment for your business: https://app.bimpactassessment.net/login\r\nYou probably wont know all the answers to these questions, that is ok. It will help give you ideas to incorporate into your strategy and help you see where your business stands.\r\nKeep in mind, you need an 80 to pass and it is not an easy test to pass!\r\n\r\n 15 minutes: Share\r\nBreak into small groups of 3-5 people\r\nDiscuss the different strategies you thought of and get feedback from the group\r\nAre the ways they are choosing to measure impact aligned with their mission?\r\nShare ideas to help each business come up with really unique strategies to make a difference based on their particular business model!\"\"\"\t\"\"\"(5 minutes: Introduction & Set-Up)\r\nClearly connect this activity to the previous discussions:\r\nWe've talked extensively about ethics, authenticity, and avoiding greenwashing/values washing. Now it’s time to put this into action. Real business ethics means aligning what you say (your values) with what you actually do. Let's move beyond words and create a concrete, measurable way to activate your brand purpose.\r\nGuiding Questions (for entrepreneurs):\r\nWhat problem are you genuinely solving?\r\nWho benefits directly from your solution (customers, employees, community)?\r\nBased on your authentic core values, what three meaningful impacts do you want your business to have in the world?\r\nActivity Instructions (1 hour):\r\nClearly list your core values and your deeper \"\"why\"\" behind your business.\r\nIdentify at least three measurable actions your business can take that authentically embody these values and positively impact your stakeholders (People, Planet, Profit).\r\nDescribe specific ways you will measure and communicate these impacts:\r\nConsider customer surveys, storytelling, transparency initiatives, and formal impact reports.\r\nExplore widely recognized third-party certifications and assessments, such as:\r\nISO standards\r\nFair Trade Certification\r\nOrganic Certification\r\nLEED Certification\r\nRainforest Alliance\r\nB Corporation Certification\r\nTake the B Impact Assessment:\r\nLog in or create an account at B Impact Assessment.\r\nWork through the questions relevant to your business. It's okay if you don't know all the answers yet—use this as a tool to identify areas where you can integrate stronger practices and measurements aligned with your values.\r\nNote: A score of 80 or above indicates passing, and it is a challenging benchmark!\r\nGroup Activity (15 minutes: Small Group Discussions)\r\nBreak into groups of 3-5.\r\nShare your identified impacts, strategies, and measurement ideas.\r\nProvide and receive feedback: Are these strategies aligned clearly with your core mission and values? Are they realistically achievable and measurable?\r\nTrainer Tip: Encourage entrepreneurs to focus deeply on practical and meaningful metrics—ones that genuinely resonate with investors, customers, and stakeholders, demonstrating authenticity beyond superficial marketing.\"\"\"\n29.

We’ve noted the **module, changes** (slides/notes/handouts), and **rationale** (why it was updated) at a high level.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
