This document is presented to the Municipality Baghdad in support of preparing a contract for completing the design, construction, and operational of the following two projects:\nThe Medical City Pump Station (T1) wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) project \nThe Zuyut Factory Pump station (TS1) WWTP project \n\n4.1 Submitted Proposal Design-Build-Operate\nOur team submitted a design-build-operate proposal for the Medical City WWTP on the of 2023, using the vertical Treatment Shaft patented technology. Before starting the design, a pilot study will be performed in the field using actual wastewater flows from the pump station to confirm our assumptions and optimize the design.  The same process has been implemented in the US with Professor Steve Right using the University of Michigan hydraulic laboratory.  Our team includes carefully selected competent firms with experience in their fields.  The team includes design consultant, quality assurance consultant, specialized construction companies (for diaphragm wall construction), and manufacturing companies from the USA, Turkey and other countries.  \n\n4.2 Water Engineering Technologies\nWater Engineering Technologies (WET) founded in 2012 by Dr. Ghalib is focused on providing systems to improve sanitation and water quality in all areas of the world.  WET has introduced technologies to prevent human contact with waste and to properly treat sewage and other wastewaters. WET has invented the Treatment Shaft to address many of the deficiencies of other solutions to this problem in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The Treatment Shaft is a United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA is the Federal regulatory environmental agency) award winning technology and listed as an “Emerging Technology” in the EPA Manual for wastewater treatment systems.  \n\n4.3 Treatment Shaft Technology  \nAn innovative and patented design featuring a vertical Treatment Shaft achieves wastewater treatment objectives at a substantially less area for construction, lower cost than traditional alternatives, while controlling odor and simplifying operations.   The Treatment Shaft technology has been proven to treat wastewater discharges and eliminate pollution impact on water resources.  \nThe fundamental element, which leads to improved aquatic and human health, is the control of wastewater discharges to rivers and water bodies. The treatment shaft provides wastewater treatment by combining many operations used in conventional treatment plants in one compact system.  It features a much smaller footprint (about 75% to 80% smaller) and at lower cost than the conventional WWTPs, which has been used for decades.  High cost and extensive maintenance of WWTP makes it uneconomical for many communities, especially in developed countries. Therefore, they discharge their sanitary sewers directly to rivers and surface waters without even basic treatment. Compared to the traditional alternatives commonly used to address sanitary sewer discharges, the Treatment Shaft technology was developed to provide an alternative that municipalities could afford within their budget and at places where space is limited and odor emission is problematic.\nThe vertical Shaft system would provide a complete treatment for municipal wastewater. Its flexible design could be adopted to treat different flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits.  The Treatment Shaft replaces all components of a conventional treatment system in fewer structures.  The advantages of the Dual Treatment Shaft are:\nLower capital and operational cost by combining many components into fewer structures and less equipment property cost.\nFraction of the footprint than any conventional wastewater treatment system.\nMuchmore  reliable odor control because of its limited ambient air exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4X Technology Overview  \n\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant introduces to Iraq a patented treatment shaft technology, a vertically integrated system designed to occupy much less space (about 20% the size of a conventional Treatment Plant) while delivering high-quality water treatment. Proven effective in reducing pollutants, this technology is a leap forward in meeting and exceeding WHO and Iraqi water discharge standards.  \nWET has two technologies for wastewater treatment that provide two levels of treatment, these are\n\nWater Engineering Technologies (WET) has two technologies for wastewater treatment that provide two levels of treatment, these are:\n\nTreatment Shaft (TS) technology for primary treatment that provides skimming, settling, screening and disinfection for most of the pollutants for safe discharge to surface water (Figure 1).\nDual Treatment Shaft (DTS) technology for providing (in addition to primary treatment) secondary and treasury treatment for municipal wastewater and for effluent water reuse for restricted irrigation (Figure 2).\n\n\n\tFigure 1 – Treatment Shaft\t\t    \tFigure 2 - Double Treatment Shaft\t\n\nIt’s an innovative and patented design featuring a Vertical Treatment Shaft achieves wastewater treatment objectives at a substantially less area for construction, lower cost than traditional alternatives, while controlling odor and simplifying operations. The technology has received many patents in the US, Japan, South Korea and more and recently in Iraq. The Treatment Shaft technology has been proven to treat wastewater discharges and eliminate pollution impact on water resources. \nThe Treatment Shaft has received acclaim and awards from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, trade magazines as well as letters from the city. You can see that in the section 4.8 Qualifications and Awards below.\n4.5 The Treatment Shaft - A Tested System\nThree major projects have been completed and have been in operation for many years in Michigan, USA.  One more project has been designed by ARCADIS Consultant for the city of New Jersey.  The following provides pictures for the three completed projects and ARCADIS design project.  A letter from the design consultant attached indicating that these projects have met the State of Michigan Environmental Protection Agency discharge requirements after five years of operation monitoring requested by the State. \n\n]]]",

This section provides an in-depth analysis of the environmental issues at the Medical City site, focusing on the adverse impacts of wastewater contamination on the Tigris River. It combines empirical research and legal analysis to present a comprehensive picture of the environmental and legal status surrounding the project. The section not only addresses the pressing water crisis in Iraq but also examines the project’s alignment with legal and environmental standards.\nHigh-Level Summary:\nMarked Reduction in River Flows: Over the last 40 years, there has been a significant decline (30-40%) in the water flows of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, leading to exacerbated pollution concerns, particularly at the Medical City site​​.\nSignificant Contamination Impact: The contamination from Medical City, as observed through on-land assessments and satellite imagery, has notably affected the Tigris River. This contamination includes elevated levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater, exceeding the thresholds established by Iraqi environmental laws​​.\nResearch and Legal Compliance: Studies conducted by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain provide substantial evidence of the contamination levels. The project's approach to addressing these environmental issues is rigorously assessed for compliance with Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment, ensuring the project’s operations are within the ambit of national environmental mandates​​.\n\n3.1 Environmental and Legal Status  \nThe water crisis in Iraq, a pressing environmental concern, is highlighted by the marked reduction in water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris rivers over the last 40 years, declining by 30 to 40%. This decrease has exacerbated pollution concerns, particularly at the Medical City site. Notably, contamination from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, significantly impacts the Tigris River. Research by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants like biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater from Medical City, surpassing legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\n\n3.2. Current Environmental Status\nThe water crisis in Iraq sets a critical backdrop for environmental discussions, as highlighted by H.E. Abdul Latif Rashid at the UN Water Conference referencing that over the last 40 years water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris have decreased by 30 to 40%. With a marked reduction in river flows pollution concerns at the Medical City site become more and more important to address.\nOf particular significance is the contamination originating from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, and notably impacting the Tigris River. \nAggregated contaminated water from Medical City is seen exiting into the Tigris River\nSatellite observations of polluted water emanating from Medical City outfall (dark color).\n\nResearch conducted by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain, as documented in papers with reference numbers ISSN: 1735-3866 and ISSN: 2412-0758\n(Number ISSN: 1735-3866 and Number ISSN: 2412-0758 respectively)\n\nIn these papers, it provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater discharged from Medical City. These levels surpass legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\nStudies such as \"Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the Medical City on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq\" by Abdullah M. Ahmed and Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani, and \"Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River\" by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah, and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi, further corroborate these findings. Notably, the mean value of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exceeds permissible limits, indicating a severe deterioration in water quality.\n\nNote: S2 is site two, at the Medical City outfall\nReference: Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the medical city on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq Abdullah M. Ahmed*, Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani https://doi.org/10.22124/cjes.2024.7447\nThe mean value of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exceeds permissible limits, indicating a deterioration in water quality.\nReference: “Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River” by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi  https://doi.org/10.30684/etj.34.3B.8\n\n\nIn light of global trends and local data, it becomes evident that strategic improvements in wastewater treatment are required. Enhanced treatment methods are essential to not only address the immediate concerns related to Medical City's outfall but also to contribute to the larger objective of mitigating Iraq's water challenges.\n\n3.3 Environmental, Social & Financial Impact\nWastewater mismanagement poses significant environmental, social, and financial threats. By contaminating natural water bodies and reducing arable land, it endangers human health and wildlife while undermining economic activities reliant on clean water. This project's investment in advanced treatment will yield substantial benefits by averting ecological damage and fostering economic prosperity through cleaner water resources.  \nThis process of dumping wastewater into the natural water supply poses hazards not only to human health, but can also have a devastating effect on wildlife, especially for fish and other animals in the water. Harmful substances in water can also get into fields and soil, which results in smaller crop yields for farmers. \nThe damage to ecosystems due to excessive wastewater discharges has impacts beyond the environment. Economic impacts, such as pumping waste water without treatment into Dijlah river, will cause losses to the population since river water is used for drinking and manufacturing activities and river banks normally are invested for recreation, commercial and employment opportunities. \nIn the economic analysis of this investment, the ecological externalities of the project were monetized, starting from the assumption that the wastewater treatment process is a process that has desired output—treated water. Their estimated value, determined by “shadow prices'', actually represents the avoided damage/costs, i.e., the realized benefit/income for the environment as a result of the removal of pollutants during treatment in the WWTP (Wastewater Treatment Plant).\nThe difference between the pollution costs for wastewater and the pollution costs for treated water represents the realized savings in the cost of pollution, i.e., environmental benefits. For example, the suspended particles. The final results of the conducted economic cost-benefit analysis unequivocally indicate the full socio-economic justification for the investment. At the same time, the sensitivity analysis proved that the project is resistant to possible changes in input parameters over time.\n\n3.4 Legal Status and Compliance\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project is set within a robust legal framework that reflects Iraq's long-standing and evolving commitment to environmental stewardship. This includes adherence to historical legislations like Regulation No. (25) of 1967, which underscores Iraq's early initiatives in preserving its water resources. \nThe project is a testament to Iraq's enduring and progressive environmental governance. It embodies the principles of historical legislations and aligns with contemporary legal obligations, such as Iraq's commitment to the UN Water Convention, ensuring the project's operations remain within the ambit of national and international environmental mandates.  \nOur project prioritizes legal compliance throughout its design and operational phases. We ensure that all aspects of wastewater treatment, from pollutant removal to effluent discharge, adhere to the mandated environmental standards. This commitment extends to regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms, ensuring ongoing compliance and adaptation to any legal updates.\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project aligns with Iraq's key environmental laws, especially Law No. 27 of 2009. This law is the main legal document that outlines the environmental considerations for any project or activity to be carried out in the Country. \nAs per the requirements of The Iraqi Environmental protection and Enhancement Law no. 27 for year 2009, our team undertake to fulfill all the requirements such as\nConduct an EIA (Environment Impact Analysis) study prior to the commencement of any project activities.\nGet the prior approval of the Ministry of Environment (MoEn) before starting the project as per articles 10 & 11 of the Law no. 27 for 2009.\nProvide and implement pollution control measures using clean. technologies, this is to be associated to ensure the proper performance of these control measures, as per article 9 of the same law.\nProvide tools for measuring the levels of pollutants. Records should be kept and made available to MoEn when needed. If such tools cannot be provided by the establishment, the MoEn performs these measurements, as per article 9 of the same law.\nBuild a database for environmental protection and sustainability, as per article 9 of the same law.\nReduce pollution through using renewable energy technologies, as per article 9 of the same law.\nWe also undertake to fulfill the requirements of any other legislation and regulations imposed by the relevant Iraqi government organization for the protection of water resources.\n3.5 Sludge Management and Disposal  \nThe Vertical Treatment Shaft, when implemented and in operation, will capture almost all the solids (TSS) and organic contaminants (BOD) from going into the river as it is the case currently.  This will be achieved by the primary treatment in the first shaft and secondary treatment using the DAF system for solids separation in the second shaft.   Skimming and settled primary solids from the first shaft (estimated to be 1.5% dry solids) will be pumped to the sludge storage/thickening tank. The waste activated sludge from the DAF’s (expected to be approximately 3% dry solids) will be diverted from the return activated sludge line from the DAFs to the sludge storage/thickening tank. Primary sludge and secondary sludge will be thickened in the sludge storage/thickener tank. The combined thickened sludge will pass through dry solids screw presses, with the dried solids (20% dry solids) being deposited by conveyor into either a dump body truck or a roll-off container. The remaining effluent discharges will meet the water TSS and BOD limits as stated in the project objectives. The projected amount of  solids at 20% dry solids is estimated to be 1,300 tonnes per day which will bring huge improvement to water quality in the river.  Dried solids could be treated using dry bed area and could be used as a fertilizer after testing for incompatible pollutants.  \nWe propose that the drying beds at the Al Rustemiya Plant in Baghdad can be effectively utilized for the drying of the sludge generated from the two vertical treatment shafts at Medical City and the Al Zuyut Factory. Utilizing the existing infrastructure at the Al Rustemiya Plant presents a practical solution for managing the sludge produced by the wastewater treatment process. By repurposing these drying beds, we can streamline the sludge disposal process and ensure efficient handling of the waste material. This collaborative approach underscores our commitment to maximizing resource utilization and optimizing the operations of our wastewater treatment facilities in Baghdad.\n3.6 Potential Nationwide Benefits\nUtilizing this technology we see the following national benefits:\nScalability Across Diverse Geographies: The compact nature and minimal land use requirement of the Treatment Shaft make it an ideal solution for both densely populated urban areas and rural settings across Iraq. Its adaptability to different site conditions and capacities means that this solution can be scaled up or down, catering to the needs of various communities throughout the country.\nCost-Effective Infrastructure Development: The Treatment Shaft technology stands out for its cost efficiency, particularly in areas where land acquisition is challenging or financially prohibitive. By minimizing the need for extensive piping and reducing the space required for wastewater treatment facilities, this solution can lead to significant savings in infrastructure development and maintenance costs nationwide.\nEnvironmental Protection and Public Health: The deployment of the Treatment Shaft technology across Iraq has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of water bodies by treating wastewater to national discharge standards. This, in turn, benefits public health, supports agriculture, and preserves the natural beauty and environmental integrity of Iraq's diverse landscapes.\nA Model for Sustainable Development: By adopting this innovative wastewater treatment technology, Iraq can position itself as a leader in sustainable water management in the region. The Treatment Shaft solution offers a practical model for addressing pressing environmental challenges while supporting economic growth and enhancing the quality of life for its citizens.\n3.7 Local Impact of Medical City's Wastewater Discharge on the Tigris River\n\nRecent studies have underscored the alarming impact of wastewater discharge from Baghdad's Medical City on the Tigris River, a crucial water source for Iraq. The research by Al Satar and Sachit from Al-Mustansiriyah University specifically investigated the change in heavy metals concentrations in the Tigris River due to this discharge. Sampling water at three strategic points - upstream, at the discharge point, and downstream - they found a marked increase in heavy metal concentrations, including Pb, Cd, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Ag, particularly at the downstream point. This is a clear indication of the pollution load being added to the river by the hospital's wastewater.\nAnother study by Al-Obaidy et al. focused on assessing the overall water quality of the Tigris River within Baghdad, taking into account the effluents from both the Medical City and Al-Rasheed Power Plant. The application of the Water Quality Index (WQI) based on various parameters such as pH, Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), and others, revealed that the water quality ranged from very poor to unsuitable in different seasons. This degradation in water quality not only poses significant health risks to the local population, reliant on the river for various needs, but also threatens the river's aquatic life and ecological balance.\nThe findings from these studies make it evident that the discharge of untreated wastewater from Medical City is contributing significantly to the pollution of the Tigris River. This situation demands immediate attention and action, not only to protect public health but also to preserve the ecological integrity of this vital waterway. The government's intervention in implementing effective wastewater treatment solutions is imperative to mitigate these risks and ensure the long-term sustainability of the Tigris River as a crucial resource for Iraq.\n3.8 Environmental Impact Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project represents a pivotal milestone in Iraq's pursuit of sustainable environmental management. Addressing the pressing environmental challenges in the Medical City area, this project introduces an advanced treatment shaft technology while ensuring strict adherence to Iraq's environmental laws. As the project progresses through the stages of development, each build will bring improvements to water quality, underscoring our commitment to long-term environmental preservation and the protection of the Tigris River.\nThe vertical treatment plant will be able to treat the effluent (waste water discharge) in the first year after the completion of the first shaft. Slowing the processes of polluting the river and reducing the damage to Dicle(Tigris) without waiting for the completion of the whole project.\nFinally, this report serves as compelling evidence of the feasibility, cost-saving, and land-saving advantages offered by our joint venture team's EPA award-winning and patented vertical shaft Wastewater Treatment Technology Solution. Through our collective efforts, we pave the way for a sustainable future, embodying Iraq's commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project represents a pivotal milestone in Iraq's pursuit of sustainable environmental management.

This patented technology stands out for its ability to treat large volumes of wastewater effectively in small spaces, marking a significant advancement in water treatment efficiency. We'll examine its distinctive features, proven success, and the wide-ranging benefits it brings to communities and the environment.\nAdditionally, we will present an overview of the technology and the projects that have been completed, as well as a list of patents granted to Dr. Ghalib related to this technology in the USA and internationally, including Japan, South Korea, Canada, and most recently in Iraq. \nThis document is submitted to the Municipality of Baghdad to support the preparation of a contract for the design, construction, and operation of two key projects: \nThe Medical City Pump Station (T1) Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)\nThe Zuyut Factory Pump Station (TS1) WWTP.\n\n4.1 Submitted Proposal Design-Build-Operate\n\nIn late 2023, our team submitted a design-build-operate proposal for the Medical City WWTP, utilizing the vertical Treatment Shaft patented technology. Prior to commencing the design, a pilot study will be conducted on-site using actual wastewater flows from the pump station to validate our assumptions and refine the design. \nThis approach has been successfully applied in the US, notably by Professor Steve Right at the University of Michigan hydraulic laboratory. Our team comprises highly skilled firms with expertise in their respective fields, including a design consultant, a quality assurance consultant, specialized construction companies for diaphragm wall construction, and manufacturing companies from the USA, Turkey, and other countries.\n\n\n\n4.2 Water Engineering Technologies\n\nFounded in 2012 by Dr. Ghalib, Water Engineering Technologies (WET) is dedicated to enhancing sanitation and water quality around the world. WET’s invention, the Treatment Shaft, is a pioneering technology that helps to prevent human contact with waste and effectively treat sewage and other wastewaters. The Treatment Shaft, a creation of WET, addresses many shortcomings of existing solutions efficiently and cost-effectively. It has earned recognition as an “Emerging Technology” by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), the US federal regulatory environmental agency, and has won several awards for its innovation in the wastewater treatment sector.\n\n4.3 Treatment Shaft Technology  \nThe Treatment Shaft Technology, featuring a vertical design, achieves efficient wastewater treatment in a smaller area and at a lower cost compared to traditional methods. This technology, proven effective in treating wastewater discharges, also helps reduce pollution's impact on water resources.\nIts smaller footprint, about 75% to 80% less than conventional WWTPs, along with its cost-effectiveness, makes it a suitable alternative for communities where space is limited and budgets are constrained. The system's flexible design allows adaptation to various flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits, making it a versatile solution. It also offers significant advantages such as lower capital and operational costs, greatly reduced footprint, and more reliable odor control due to limited air exposure.The technology has received many patents in the US, Japan, South Korea and more and more recently in Iraq. The Treatment Shaft technology has been proven to treat wastewater discharges and eliminate pollution impact on water resources. \nThe high cost and extensive maintenance of WWTP makes it uneconomical for many communities, especially in developing countries. Therefore, they discharge their sanitary sewers directly to rivers and surface waters without even basic treatment. Compared to the traditional alternatives commonly used to address sanitary sewer discharges, the Treatment Shaft technology was developed to provide an alternative that municipalities could afford within their budget and at places where space is limited and odor emission is problematic.\n\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant introduces this technology to Iraq, designed to occupy about 20% of the space required by a conventional Treatment Plant. It effectively reduces pollutants, aligning with WHO and Iraqi water discharge standards. Water Engineering Technologies (WET) offers two levels of treatment with this technology: the Treatment Shaft (TS) for primary treatment, including skimming, settling, screening, and disinfection, and the Dual Treatment Shaft (DTS) for secondary and tertiary treatment, suitable for municipal wastewater and effluent water reuse.\n\nWater Engineering Technologies (WET) has two technologies for wastewater treatment that provide two levels of treatment, these are:\n\nTreatment Shaft (TS) technology for primary treatment that provides skimming, settling, screening and disinfection for most of the pollutants for safe discharge to surface water (Figure 1).\nDual Treatment Shaft (DTS) technology for providing (in addition to primary treatment) secondary and treasury treatment for municipal wastewater and for effluent water reuse for restricted irrigation (Figure 2).\n\n\n\tFigure 1 – Treatment Shaft\t\t    \tFigure 2 - Double Treatment Shaft\t\n\nThe Treatment Shaft has received acclaim and awards from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, trade magazines as well as letters from the city. You can see that in the section 4.8 Qualifications and Awards below.\nThe vertical Shaft system would provide a complete treatment for municipal wastewater. Its flexible design could be adopted to treat different flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits.  The Treatment Shaft replaces all components of a conventional treatment system in fewer structures.  The advantages of the Dual Treatment Shaft are:\nLower capital and operational cost by combining many components into fewer structures and less equipment property cost.\nFraction of the footprint than any conventional wastewater treatment system.\nMuch more reliable odor control because of its limited ambient air exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Comparative Analysis\nWhat follows, is a comparative study between the newly awarded traditional Wastewater Treatment Plant (Al Khansa in Baghdad) by the municipality of Baghdad, sewerage department and  the proposed Medical City/Al Zuyut Vertical Wastewater Treatment Plant.  This comparison will address the technical, cost and space requirements aspects of the two alternatives.  This comparison shows that the Vertical Treatment Shaft is similar in achieving the treatment requirements with much less cost and land use.\nTechnical Comparison\nThe following table compares the  traditional Wastewater Treatment Plant critical technical design criteria and the proposed innovative Medical City/Al Zuyut Wastewater Treatment Plant using Vertical Treatment Shaft.  As shown on the table,  there is a similarity between the two criteria, however the Vertical Treatment Shaft uses a different arrangement of the main treatment components and processes to be located  in fewer and deeper structures that will save on cost and uses a fraction of land needed. \nComponents\nVertical Treatment Shaft\nTraditional WWTP\n1.

Solid Handling Unit\nSludge dewatering and Thickener\nSludge dewatering and Thickener\nSolid Disposal\nOff Site\nOff Site\n\nCapacity \nThe Al Khansa Wastewater treatment plant was designed with a Capacity Of 200,000 ㎥/Day.  It is located at the end of the northeastern main sewage line  on the banks of the Diyala River within the Alfadhiliya area.  \nIn comparison, the Medical City proposed Wastewater Treatment Plant will be designed for 182,000 ㎥/Day for sanitary waste flow during dry weather condition and 900,000  ㎥/Day.  for combined flow (sanitary and storm) during wet weather conditions.  \n\n\n\nCost Comparison\nThe Al Khansa Wastewater Treatment Plant was designed for a treatment capacity of 200,000 ㎥/day.  The construction cost for this project was awarded for 223 million USD. To our understanding, this does not include the cost of feasibility study, design and operation.  This unit cost is equivalent to 1,115 USD/㎥/day of treated wastewater (223,000,000 / 200,000) \nOn the other hand, the Medical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Shaft treatment capacity of  182,000 ㎥/day total cost is 146,651,127 million USD inclusive of feasibility study, design, and operation management:   This unit cost is equivalent to 1,115 USD/㎥/day of treated wastewater (146,651,127/ 182,000) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand Requirements\nThe Al Khansa Wastewater Treatment Plant is designed to be built on an area of  126,607 ㎡ (51 dunums). The area available for the Medical City Vertical Treatment Shaft treatment is a parcel of 100 m by 100 m (10,000 ㎡ or 4 dunums).  This is the only parcel of land that the municipality could acquire next to the Medical City Complex. This will preclude using any traditional WasteWater Treatment option that requires a much larger area.  The following provides a drawing showing the comparison of the footprint of the Vertical Treatment Shaft proposed to the Medical City project compared to traditional treatment represented by Al Khansa project and proposed location for the Medical City WWTP at the available land next to the Medical City complex.  \n\n\nFootprint and space allocated for the Al khansa (51 Dunums) and Medical City WWTPs (4 Dunums)\n\n\n\nMedical City WWTP Proposed Construction Site on a 4 Dunums Lot Next to the Medical City Complex in Baghdad\n\n\nOdor Control\nWhile improving the quality of the water, urban sewage plants have brought problems to its surrounding environment, the most typical of which is the problem of odor pollution. The Al Khansa WWTP uses oxidation ditches typical for conventional treatment plant design that emits unacceptable odors during operation especially next to the Medical City Complex in the center of the capital Baghdad and very close to the Tigris River that could be developed in the future to a park.  Al Khansa WWTP was designed to use conventional Aeration Chambers for treatment.  These chambers are open surface tanks that agitate the sewage water as it passes through it with rotating brushes.  This process produces a great amount of odors to the ambient air.  \n\n\nAl Khansa WWTP -Uses 24 Oxidation Ditches that cause source of odor.\nOdor control for the Medical  City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants will be provided by enclosing the headworks and sludge dewatering equipment in the headworks building.  Shaft 1 will also be covered.  Fresh air for these enclosed areas will be provided and form the input to the activated sludge aeration compressors.  This will result in the odors emanating from these enclosed portions of the plant to be deodorized by the mixed liquor. \nOdor is one of the negative impacts of any wastewater treatment facility and especially in congested areas like the Medical Center area.  Because of the compact nature of the Treatment Shaft and the facility is not spread out and limited to only a few structures, providing cover for the facility is an effective way of controlling odor emission.  Air ventilation from the space below the cover will reduce odor escaping outside.  Exhaust air will be directed to the air blower for the aeration chamber for treatment.   \n\nMedical City WWTP Uses Covers and Treat Odor in the Headspace Air (No Discharge to Ambient Atmosphere)\n\n4.8 Treatment Shaft Qualifications and Awards\n\nThe United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\nlisted the Treatment Shaft as an “Emerging Technology” in their Engineering Technology Manual\n\nThe Treatment Shaft was recognized as an innovative Emerging Technology in the “United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)’s Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management” Manual in 2013 document issued March, 2013. View online here on page 4-1 or see documentation below:\n\nThe \"United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management\" manual, published in 2013, explores cutting-edge innovations in wastewater treatment and management. This comprehensive document highlights emerging technologies aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes, particularly during periods of wet weather.\nThis includes award-winning technology involving a comprehensive process encompassing pre-treatment, primary and secondary treatment phases, and a final disinfection stage. Each phase is meticulously designed to efficiently reduce specific pollutants. By modeling the improvements in water markers for the Medical City site, we are confident that we can not only meet but also exceed the WHO and Iraqi legal standards for water discharge quality. Through the incorporation of advanced techniques and methodologies outlined in the EPA manual, we aim to address evolving challenges in wastewater management while promoting environmental sustainability and public health protection.\n\nUnited State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\n\nAward: EPA Performance and Innovation Creating Environmental Success\n\nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), the environmental regulatory agency in the State of Michigan, has nominated Dr. Ghalib for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for State Revolving Fund Creating Environmental Success (PISCES) Award” which was granted for the savings provided to the City.

This project is in line with Iraq's longstanding commitment to environmental legislation, a commitment that has its roots in early initiatives such as Regulation No. (25) of 1967 and is strengthened by Iraq's participation in the UN Water Convention and notably Law No 27 of 2009 for Protection and Improvement of Environment. By advancing sustainable water management and reinforcing environmental stewardship, this project is a continuation of Iraq's dedication to preserving its water resources and upholding environmental standards​​.\nAt this crucial juncture, Iraq is poised to reaffirm its role in environmental governance and implementation. This project exemplifies innovative approaches in wastewater treatment, playing a vital role in enhancing the health and safety of Iraqi citizens. It aligns with the nation's legal frameworks and underscores a commitment to environmental excellence by reducing healthcare costs and safeguarding water resources.\n\n\n\n8.0 Conclusions\nThe vertical treatment plant, central to this project, is designed to commence its operation effectively within the first year following the completion of its initial shaft. This prompt functionality is critical in slowing the pollution of the Tigris River and mitigating environmental damage, offering immediate benefits even before the entire project is completed​​.\nThis project exemplifies a model of efficient and sustainable wastewater management, crucial for the ecological preservation of Iraq's vital waterways. It represents a significant step towards addressing the pressing environmental challenges in the region and reflects a comprehensive approach to protecting the nation's water resources. The implementation of this project is expected to set a new benchmark in wastewater treatment, contributing to the overall improvement of water quality and environmental health in Iraq.\nFinally, this report serves as compelling evidence of the feasibility, cost-saving, and land-saving advantages offered by our joint venture team's EPA award-winning and patented vertical shaft Wastewater Treatment Technology Solution. Through our collective efforts, we pave the way for a sustainable future, embodying Iraq's commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable development.\n",

This section provides an in-depth analysis of the environmental issues at the Medical City site, focusing on the adverse impacts of wastewater contamination on the Tigris River. It combines research and legal analysis to present a comprehensive picture of the environmental and legal status surrounding the project. The section not only addresses the pressing water crisis in Iraq but also examines the project’s alignment with legal and environmental standards.\nHigh-Level Summary:\nMarked Reduction in River Flows: Over the last 40 years, there has been a significant decline (30-40%) in the water flows of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, leading to exacerbated pollution concerns, particularly at the Medical City site​​.\nSignificant Contamination Impact: The contamination from Medical City, as observed through on-land assessments and satellite imagery, has notably affected the Tigris River. This contamination includes elevated levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater, exceeding the thresholds established by Iraqi environmental laws​​.\nResearch and Legal Compliance: Studies conducted by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain provide substantial evidence of the contamination levels. The project's approach to addressing these environmental issues is rigorously assessed for compliance with Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment, ensuring the project’s operations are within the ambit of national environmental mandates​​.\n\n3.1 Environmental and Legal Status  \n\nThe water crisis in Iraq, a pressing environmental concern, is highlighted by the marked reduction in water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris rivers over the last 40 years, declining by 30 to 40%. This decrease has exacerbated pollution concerns, particularly at the Medical City site. Notably, contamination from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, significantly impacts the Tigris River. Research by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants like biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater from Medical City, surpassing legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\n\n3.2. Current Environmental Status\nThe water crisis in Iraq sets a critical backdrop for environmental discussions, as highlighted by H.E. Abdul Latif Rashid at the UN Water Conference referencing that over the last 40 years water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris have decreased by 30 to 40%. With a marked reduction in river flows pollution concerns at the Medical City site become more and more important to address.\nOf particular significance is the contamination originating from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, and notably impacting the Tigris River. \nAggregated contaminated water from Medical City is seen exiting into the Tigris River\nSatellite observations of polluted water emanating from Medical City outfall (dark color).\n\nResearch conducted by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain, as documented in papers with reference numbers ISSN: 1735-3866 and ISSN: 2412-0758(Number ISSN: 1735-3866 and Number ISSN: 2412-0758 respectively)\n\nIn these papers, it provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater discharged from Medical City. These levels surpass legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\nStudies such as \"Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the Medical City on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq\" by Abdullah M. Ahmed and Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani, and \"Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River\" by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah, and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi, further corroborate these findings. Notably, the mean value of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exceeds permissible limits, indicating a severe deterioration in water quality.\n\nNote: S2 is site two, at the Medical City outfall\nReference: Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the medical city on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq Abdullah M. Ahmed*, Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani https://doi.org/10.22124/cjes.2024.7447\nThe mean value of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exceeds permissible limits, indicating a deterioration in water quality.\nReference: “Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River” by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi  https://doi.org/10.30684/etj.34.3B.8\n\n\nIn light of global trends and local data, it becomes evident that strategic improvements in wastewater treatment are required. Enhanced treatment methods are essential to not only address the immediate concerns related to Medical City's outfall but also to contribute to the larger objective of mitigating Iraq's water challenges.\n\n3.3 Environmental, Social & Financial Impact\nWastewater mismanagement poses significant environmental, social, and financial threats. By contaminating natural water bodies and reducing arable land, it endangers human health and wildlife while undermining economic activities reliant on clean water. This project's investment in advanced treatment will yield substantial benefits by averting ecological damage and fostering economic prosperity through cleaner water resources.  \nThis process of dumping wastewater into the natural water supply poses hazards not only to human health, but can also have a devastating effect on wildlife, especially for fish and other animals in the water. Harmful substances in water can also get into fields and soil, which results in smaller crop yields for farmers. \nThe damage to ecosystems due to excessive wastewater discharges has impacts beyond the environment. Economic impacts, such as pumping waste water without treatment into Dijlah river, will cause losses to the population since river water is used for drinking and manufacturing activities and river banks normally are invested for recreation, commercial and employment opportunities. \nIn the economic analysis of this investment, the ecological externalities of the project were monetized, starting from the assumption that the wastewater treatment process is a process that has desired output—treated water. Their estimated value, determined by “shadow prices'', actually represents the avoided damage/costs, i.e., the realized benefit/income for the environment as a result of the removal of pollutants during treatment in the WWTP (Wastewater Treatment Plant).\nThe difference between the pollution costs for wastewater and the pollution costs for treated water represents the realized savings in the cost of pollution, i.e., environmental benefits. For example, the suspended particles. The final results of the conducted economic cost-benefit analysis unequivocally indicate the full socio-economic justification for the investment. At the same time, the sensitivity analysis proved that the project is resistant to possible changes in input parameters over time.\n\n3.4 Legal Status and Compliance\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project is set within a robust legal framework that reflects Iraq's long-standing and evolving commitment to environmental stewardship. This includes adherence to historical legislations like Regulation No. (25) of 1967, which underscores Iraq's early initiatives in preserving its water resources. \nThe project is a testament to Iraq's enduring and progressive environmental governance. It embodies the principles of historical legislations and aligns with contemporary legal obligations, such as Iraq's commitment to the UN Water Convention, ensuring the project's operations remain within the ambit of national and international environmental mandates.  \nOur project prioritizes legal compliance throughout its design and operational phases. We ensure that all aspects of wastewater treatment, from pollutant removal to effluent discharge, adhere to the mandated environmental standards. This commitment extends to regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms, ensuring ongoing compliance and adaptation to any legal updates.\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project aligns with Iraq's key environmental laws, especially Law No. 27 of 2009. This law is the main legal document that outlines the environmental considerations for any project or activity to be carried out in the Country. \nAs per the requirements of The Iraqi Environmental protection and Enhancement Law no. 27 for year 2009, our team undertake to fulfill all the requirements such as\nConduct an EIA (Environment Impact Analysis) study prior to the commencement of any project activities.\nGet the prior approval of the Ministry of Environment (MoEn) before starting the project as per articles 10 & 11 of the Law no. 27 for 2009.\nProvide and implement pollution control measures using clean. technologies, this is to be associated to ensure the proper performance of these control measures, as per article 9 of the same law.\nProvide tools for measuring the levels of pollutants. Records should be kept and made available to MoEn when needed. If such tools cannot be provided by the establishment, the MoEn performs these measurements, as per article 9 of the same law.\nBuild a database for environmental protection and sustainability, as per article 9 of the same law.\nReduce pollution through using renewable energy technologies, as per article 9 of the same law.\nWe also undertake to fulfill the requirements of any other legislation and regulations imposed by the relevant Iraqi government organization for the protection of water resources.\n3.5 Sludge Management and Disposal  \nThe Vertical Treatment Shaft, when implemented and in operation, will capture almost all the solids (TSS) and organic contaminants (BOD) from going into the river as it is the case currently.  This will be achieved by the primary treatment in the first shaft and secondary treatment using the DAF system for solids separation in the second shaft.   Skimming and settled primary solids from the first shaft (estimated to be 1.5% dry solids) will be pumped to the sludge storage/thickening tank. The waste activated sludge from the DAF’s (expected to be approximately 3% dry solids) will be diverted from the return activated sludge line from the DAFs to the sludge storage/thickening tank. Primary sludge and secondary sludge will be thickened in the sludge storage/thickener tank. The combined thickened sludge will pass through dry solids screw presses, with the dried solids (20% dry solids) being deposited by conveyor into either a dump body truck or a roll-off container. The remaining effluent discharges will meet the water TSS and BOD limits as stated in the project objectives. The projected amount of  solids at 20% dry solids is estimated to be 1,300 tonnes per day which will bring huge improvement to water quality in the river.  Dried solids could be treated using dry bed area and could be used as a fertilizer after testing for incompatible pollutants.  \nWe propose that the drying beds at the Al Rustemiya Plant in Baghdad can be effectively utilized for the drying of the sludge generated from the two vertical treatment shafts at Medical City and the Al Zuyut Factory. Utilizing the existing infrastructure at the Al Rustemiya Plant presents a practical solution for managing the sludge produced by the wastewater treatment process. By repurposing these drying beds, we can streamline the sludge disposal process and ensure efficient handling of the waste material. This collaborative approach underscores our commitment to maximizing resource utilization and optimizing the operations of our wastewater treatment facilities in Baghdad.\n3.6 Potential Nationwide Benefits\nUtilizing this technology we see the following national benefits:\nScalability Across Diverse Geographies: The compact nature and minimal land use requirement of the Treatment Shaft make it an ideal solution for both densely populated urban areas and rural settings across Iraq. Its adaptability to different site conditions and capacities means that this solution can be scaled up or down, catering to the needs of various communities throughout the country.\nCost-Effective Infrastructure Development: The Treatment Shaft technology stands out for its cost efficiency, particularly in areas where land acquisition is challenging or financially prohibitive. By minimizing the need for extensive piping and reducing the space required for wastewater treatment facilities, this solution can lead to significant savings in infrastructure development and maintenance costs nationwide.\nEnvironmental Protection and Public Health: The deployment of the Treatment Shaft technology across Iraq has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of water bodies by treating wastewater to national discharge standards. This, in turn, benefits public health, supports agriculture, and preserves the natural beauty and environmental integrity of Iraq's diverse landscapes.\nA Model for Sustainable Development: By adopting this innovative wastewater treatment technology, Iraq can position itself as a leader in sustainable water management in the region. The Treatment Shaft solution offers a practical model for addressing pressing environmental challenges while supporting economic growth and enhancing the quality of life for its citizens.\n3.7 Local Impact of Medical City's Wastewater Discharge on the Tigris River\n\nRecent studies have underscored the alarming impact of wastewater discharge from Baghdad's Medical City on the Tigris River, a crucial water source for Iraq. The research by Al Satar and Sachit from Al-Mustansiriyah University specifically investigated the change in heavy metals concentrations in the Tigris River due to this discharge. Sampling water at three strategic points - upstream, at the discharge point, and downstream - they found a marked increase in heavy metal concentrations, including Pb, Cd, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Ag, particularly at the downstream point. This is a clear indication of the pollution load being added to the river by the hospital's wastewater.\nAnother study by Al-Obaidy et al. focused on assessing the overall water quality of the Tigris River within Baghdad, taking into account the effluents from both the Medical City and Al-Rasheed Power Plant. The application of the Water Quality Index (WQI) based on various parameters such as pH, Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), and others, revealed that the water quality ranged from very poor to unsuitable in different seasons. This degradation in water quality not only poses significant health risks to the local population, reliant on the river for various needs, but also threatens the river's aquatic life and ecological balance.\nThe findings from these studies make it evident that the discharge of untreated wastewater from Medical City is contributing significantly to the pollution of the Tigris River. This situation demands immediate attention and action, not only to protect public health but also to preserve the ecological integrity of this vital waterway. The government's intervention in implementing effective wastewater treatment solutions is imperative to mitigate these risks and ensure the long-term sustainability of the Tigris River as a crucial resource for Iraq.\n3.8 Environmental Impact Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project represents a pivotal milestone in Iraq's pursuit of sustainable environmental management. Addressing the pressing environmental challenges in the Medical City area, this project introduces an advanced treatment shaft technology while ensuring strict adherence to Iraq's environmental laws. As the project progresses through the stages of development, each build will bring improvements to water quality, underscoring our commitment to long-term environmental preservation and the protection of the Tigris River.\nThe vertical treatment plant will be able to treat the effluent (waste water discharge) in the first year after the completion of the first shaft. Slowing the processes of polluting the river and reducing the damage to Dicle(Tigris) without waiting for the completion of the whole project.\nFinally, this report serves as compelling evidence of the feasibility, cost-saving, and land-saving advantages offered by our joint venture team's EPA award-winning and patented vertical shaft Wastewater Treatment Technology Solution. Through our collective efforts, we pave the way for a sustainable future, embodying Iraq's commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project represents a pivotal milestone in Iraq's pursuit of sustainable environmental management.

This patented technology stands out for its ability to treat large volumes of wastewater effectively in small spaces, marking a significant advancement in water treatment efficiency. We'll examine its distinctive features, proven success, and the wide-ranging benefits it brings to communities and the environment.\nAdditionally, we will present an overview of the technology and the projects that have been completed, as well as a list of patents granted to Dr. Ghalib related to this technology in the USA and internationally, including Japan, South Korea, Canada, and most recently in Iraq. \nThis document is submitted to the Municipality of Baghdad to support the preparation of a contract for the design, construction, and operation of two key projects: \nThe Medical City Pump Station (T1) Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)\nThe Zuyut Factory Pump Station (TS1) WWTP.\n\n4.1 Submitted Proposal Design-Build-Operate\n\nIn late 2023, our team submitted a design-build-operate proposal for the Medical City WWTP, utilizing the vertical Treatment Shaft patented technology. Prior to commencing the design, a pilot study will be conducted on-site using actual wastewater flows from the pump station to validate our assumptions and refine the design. \nThis approach has been successfully applied in the US, notably by Professor Steve Right at the University of Michigan hydraulic laboratory. Our team comprises highly skilled firms with expertise in their respective fields, including a design consultant, a quality assurance consultant, specialized construction companies for diaphragm wall construction, and manufacturing companies from the USA, Turkey, and other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Water Engineering Technologies\n\nFounded in 2012 by Dr. Ghalib, Water Engineering Technologies (WET) is dedicated to enhancing sanitation and water quality around the world. WET’s invention, the Treatment Shaft, is a pioneering technology that helps to prevent human contact with waste and effectively treat sewage and other wastewaters. The Treatment Shaft, a creation of WET, addresses many shortcomings of existing solutions efficiently and cost-effectively. It has earned recognition as an “Emerging Technology” by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), the US federal regulatory environmental agency, and has won several awards for its innovation in the wastewater treatment sector.\n\n4.3 Treatment Shaft Technology  \nThe Treatment Shaft Technology, featuring a vertical design, achieves efficient wastewater treatment in a smaller area and at a lower cost compared to traditional methods. This technology, proven effective in treating wastewater discharges, also helps reduce pollution's impact on water resources.\nIts smaller footprint, about 75% to 80% less than conventional WWTPs, along with its cost-effectiveness, makes it a suitable alternative for communities where space is limited and budgets are constrained. The system's flexible design allows adaptation to various flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits, making it a versatile solution. It also offers significant advantages such as lower capital and operational costs, greatly reduced footprint, and more reliable odor control due to limited air exposure.The technology has received many patents in the US, Japan, South Korea and more and more recently in Iraq. The Treatment Shaft technology has been proven to treat wastewater discharges and eliminate pollution impact on water resources. \nThe high cost and extensive maintenance of WWTP makes it uneconomical for many communities, especially in developing countries. Therefore, they discharge their sanitary sewers directly to rivers and surface waters without even basic treatment. Compared to the traditional alternatives commonly used to address sanitary sewer discharges, the Treatment Shaft technology was developed to provide an alternative that municipalities could afford within their budget and at places where space is limited and odor emission is problematic.\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant introduces this technology to Iraq, designed to occupy about 20% of the space required by a conventional Treatment Plant. It effectively reduces pollutants, aligning with WHO and Iraqi water discharge standards. Water Engineering Technologies (WET) offers two levels of treatment with this technology: the Treatment Shaft (TS) for primary treatment, including skimming, settling, screening, and disinfection, and the Dual Treatment Shaft (DTS) for secondary and tertiary treatment, suitable for municipal wastewater and effluent water reuse.\n\nWater Engineering Technologies (WET) has two technologies for wastewater treatment that provide two levels of treatment, these are:\n\nTreatment Shaft (TS) technology for primary treatment that provides skimming, settling, screening and disinfection for most of the pollutants for safe discharge to surface water (Figure 1).\nDual Treatment Shaft (DTS) technology for providing (in addition to primary treatment) secondary and treasury treatment for municipal wastewater and for effluent water reuse for restricted irrigation (Figure 2).\n\n\n\tFigure 1 – Treatment Shaft\t\t    \tFigure 2 - Double Treatment Shaft\t\n\nThe Treatment Shaft has received acclaim and awards from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, trade magazines as well as letters from the city.  WET’s Qualifications and Awards below are presented in Section 4.8. \nThe vertical Shaft system would provide a complete treatment for municipal wastewater. Its flexible design could be adopted to treat different flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits.  The Treatment Shaft replaces all components of a conventional treatment system in fewer structures.  The advantages of the Dual Treatment Shaft are:\nLower capital and operational cost by combining many components into fewer structures and less equipment property cost.\nFraction of the footprint than any conventional wastewater treatment system.\nMuch more reliable odor control because of its limited ambient air exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Comparative Analysis\nWhat follows, is a comparative study between the newly awarded traditional Wastewater Treatment Plant (Al Khansa in Baghdad) by the municipality of Baghdad, sewerage department and  the proposed Medical City/Al Zuyut Vertical Wastewater Treatment Plant.  This comparison will address the technical, cost and space requirements aspects of the two alternatives.  This comparison shows that the Vertical Treatment Shaft has a similar or higher level of treatment than conventional systems with much less cost, less  land use, and complete odor control.  \nTechnical Comparison\nThe following table compares the  traditional Wastewater Treatment Plant critical technical design criteria and the proposed innovative Medical City/Al Zuyut Wastewater Treatment Plant using Vertical Treatment Shaft.  As shown on the table,  there is a similarity between the two criteria, however the Vertical Treatment Shaft uses a different arrangement of the main treatment components and processes to be located  in fewer and deeper structures that will save on cost and uses a fraction of land needed. \nComponents\nVertical Treatment Shaft\nTraditional WWTP\n1.

Solid Handling Unit\nSludge dewatering and Thickener\nSludge dewatering and Thickener\nSolid Disposal\nOff Site\nOff Site\n\nCapacity \nThe Al Khansa Wastewater treatment plant was designed with a Capacity Of 200,000 ㎥/Day.  It is located at the end of the northeastern main sewage line  on the banks of the Diyala River within the Alfadhiliya area.  \nIn comparison, the Medical City proposed Wastewater Treatment Plant will be designed for 182,000 ㎥/Day for sanitary waste flow during dry weather condition and 900,000  ㎥/Day.  for combined flow (sanitary and storm) during wet weather conditions.  \n\n\nCost Comparison\nThe Al Khansa Wastewater Treatment Plant was designed for a treatment capacity of 200,000 ㎥/day.  The construction cost for this project was awarded for 223 million USD. To our understanding, this does not include the cost of feasibility study, design and operation.  This unit cost is equivalent to 1,115 USD/㎥/day of treated wastewater (223,000,000 / 200,000) \nOn the other hand, the Medical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Shaft treatment capacity of  182,000 ㎥/day total cost is 146,651,127 million USD inclusive of feasibility study, design, and operation management:   This unit cost is equivalent to 1,115 USD/㎥/day of treated wastewater (146,651,127/ 182,000) .\n\nLand Requirements\nThe Al Khansa Wastewater Treatment Plant is designed to be built on an area of  126,607 ㎡ (51 dunums). The area available for the Medical City Vertical Treatment Shaft treatment is a parcel of 100 m by 100 m (10,000 ㎡ or 4 dunums).  This is the only parcel of land that the municipality could acquire next to the Medical City Complex. This will preclude using any traditional WasteWater Treatment option that requires a much larger area.  The following provides a drawing showing the comparison of the footprint of the Vertical Treatment Shaft proposed to the Medical City project compared to traditional treatment represented by Al Khansa project and proposed location for the Medical City WWTP at the available land next to the Medical City complex.  \n\n\n\n\nFootprint and space allocated for the Al khansa (51 Dunums) and Medical City WWTPs (4 Dunums) (NEED TO PUT THE AREA OF OUR VERTICAL TREATMENT ON THE ABOVE PLOT FOR COMPARISON AND NOT ONLY ON ITS OWN\n\nMedical City WWTP Proposed Construction Site on a 4 Dunums Lot Next to the Medical City Complex in Baghdad\nOdor Control\nWhile improving the quality of the water, urban sewage plants have brought problems to its surrounding environment, the most typical of which is the problem of odor pollution. The Al Khansa WWTP uses oxidation ditches typical for conventional treatment plant design that emits unacceptable odors during operation especially next to the Medical City Complex in the center of the capital Baghdad and very close to the Tigris River that could be developed in the future to a park.  Al Khansa WWTP was designed to use conventional Aeration Chambers for treatment.  These chambers are open surface tanks that agitate the sewage water as it passes through it with rotating brushes.  This process produces a great amount of odors to the ambient air.  \n\n\nAl Khansa WWTP -Uses 24 Oxidation Ditches that cause source of odor.\nOdor control for the Medical  City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants will be provided by enclosing the headworks and sludge dewatering equipment in the headworks building.  Shaft 1 will also be covered.  Fresh air for these enclosed areas will be provided and form the input to the activated sludge aeration compressors.  This will result in the odors emanating from these enclosed portions of the plant to be deodorized by the mixed liquor. \nOdor is one of the negative impacts of any wastewater treatment facility and especially in congested areas like the Medical Center area.  Because of the compact nature of the Treatment Shaft and the facility is not spread out and limited to only a few structures, providing cover for the facility is an effective way of controlling odor emission.  Air ventilation from the space below the cover will reduce odor escaping outside.  Exhaust air will be directed to the air blower for the aeration chamber for treatment.   \n\nMedical City WWTP Uses Covers and Treat Odor in the Headspace Air (No Discharge to Ambient Atmosphere)\n\n4.8 Treatment Shaft Qualifications and Awards\n\nThe United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\nlisted the Treatment Shaft as an “Emerging Technology” in their Engineering Technology Manual\n\nThe Treatment Shaft was recognized as an innovative Emerging Technology in the “United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)’s Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management” Manual in 2013 document issued March, 2013. View online here on page 4-1 or see documentation below:\n\nThe \"United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management\" manual, published in 2013, explores cutting-edge innovations in wastewater treatment and management. This comprehensive document highlights emerging technologies aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes, particularly during periods of wet weather.\nThis includes award-winning technology involving a comprehensive process encompassing pre-treatment, primary and secondary treatment phases, and a final disinfection stage.

      "content": "Can you do the same for this section, the environment section? The summary needs work:\nEnvironmental Report Section Summary\nThis environment report section discusses the crucial aspects of the current environmental challenges in Iraq, especially concerning water management and legal compliance. This section provides an in-depth analysis of the environmental issues at the Medical City site, focusing on the adverse impacts of wastewater contamination on the Tigris River. It combines research and legal analysis to present a comprehensive picture of the environmental and legal status surrounding the project. The section not only addresses the pressing water crisis in Iraq but also examines the project’s alignment with legal and environmental standards.\nExecutive Insights\nMarked Reduction in River Flows: Over the last 40 years, there has been a significant decline (30-40%) in the water flows of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, leading to exacerbated pollution concerns, particularly at the Medical City site​​.\nSignificant Contamination Impact: The contamination from Medical City, as observed through on-land assessments and satellite imagery, has notably affected the Tigris River. This contamination includes elevated levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater, exceeding the thresholds established by Iraqi environmental laws​​.\nResearch and Legal Compliance: Studies conducted by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain provide substantial evidence of the contamination levels. The project's approach to addressing these environmental issues is rigorously assessed for compliance with Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment, ensuring the project’s operations are within the ambit of national environmental mandates​​.\n\n3.1 Environmental and Legal Status  \n\nThe water crisis in Iraq, a pressing environmental concern, is highlighted by the marked reduction in water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris rivers over the last 40 years, declining by 30 to 40%. This decrease has exacerbated pollution concerns, particularly at the Medical City site. Notably, contamination from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, significantly impacts the Tigris River. Research by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants like biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater from Medical City, surpassing legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\n\n3.2. Current Environmental Status\nThe water crisis in Iraq sets a critical backdrop for environmental discussions, as highlighted by H.E. Abdul Latif Rashid at the UN Water Conference referencing that over the last 40 years water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris have decreased by 30 to 40%. With a marked reduction in river flows pollution concerns at the Medical City site become more and more important to address.\nOf particular significance is the contamination originating from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, and notably impacting the Tigris River. \nAggregated contaminated water from Medical City is seen exiting into the Tigris River\nSatellite observations of polluted water emanating from Medical City outfall (dark color).\n\nResearch conducted by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain, as documented in papers with reference numbers ISSN: 1735-3866 and ISSN: 2412-0758(Number ISSN: 1735-3866 and Number ISSN: 2412-0758 respectively)\n\nIn these papers, it provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater discharged from Medical City. These levels surpass legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\nStudies such as \"Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the Medical City on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq\" by Abdullah M. Ahmed and Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani, and \"Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River\" by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah, and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi, further corroborate these findings. Notably, the mean value of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exceeds permissible limits, indicating a severe deterioration in water quality.\n\nNote: S2 is site two, at the Medical City outfall\nReference: Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the medical city on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq Abdullah M. Ahmed*, Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani https://doi.org/10.22124/cjes.2024.7447\nThe mean value of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exceeds permissible limits, indicating a deterioration in water quality.\nReference: “Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River” by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi  https://doi.org/10.30684/etj.34.3B.8\n\n\nIn light of global trends and local data, it becomes evident that strategic improvements in wastewater treatment are required. Enhanced treatment methods are essential to not only address the immediate concerns related to Medical City's outfall but also to contribute to the larger objective of mitigating Iraq's water challenges.\n\n3.3 Environmental, Social & Financial Impact\nWastewater mismanagement poses significant environmental, social, and financial threats. By contaminating natural water bodies and reducing arable land, it endangers human health and wildlife while undermining economic activities reliant on clean water. This project's investment in advanced treatment will yield substantial benefits by averting ecological damage and fostering economic prosperity through cleaner water resources.  \nThis process of dumping wastewater into the natural water supply poses hazards not only to human health, but can also have a devastating effect on wildlife, especially for fish and other animals in the water. Harmful substances in water can also get into fields and soil, which results in smaller crop yields for farmers. \nThe damage to ecosystems due to excessive wastewater discharges has impacts beyond the environment. Economic impacts, such as pumping waste water without treatment into Dijlah river, will cause losses to the population since river water is used for drinking and manufacturing activities and river banks normally are invested for recreation, commercial and employment opportunities. \nIn the economic analysis of this investment, the ecological externalities of the project were monetized, starting from the assumption that the wastewater treatment process is a process that has desired output—treated water. Their estimated value, determined by “shadow prices'', actually represents the avoided damage/costs, i.e., the realized benefit/income for the environment as a result of the removal of pollutants during treatment in the WWTP (Wastewater Treatment Plant).\nThe difference between the pollution costs for wastewater and the pollution costs for treated water represents the realized savings in the cost of pollution, i.e., environmental benefits. For example, the suspended particles. The final results of the conducted economic cost-benefit analysis unequivocally indicate the full socio-economic justification for the investment. At the same time, the sensitivity analysis proved that the project is resistant to possible changes in input parameters over time.\n\n3.4 Legal Status and Compliance\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project is set within a robust legal framework that reflects Iraq's long-standing and evolving commitment to environmental stewardship. This includes adherence to historical legislations like Regulation No. (25) of 1967, which underscores Iraq's early initiatives in preserving its water resources. \nThe project is a testament to Iraq's enduring and progressive environmental governance. It embodies the principles of historical legislations and aligns with contemporary legal obligations, such as Iraq's commitment to the UN Water Convention, ensuring the project's operations remain within the ambit of national and international environmental mandates.  \nOur project prioritizes legal compliance throughout its design and operational phases. We ensure that all aspects of wastewater treatment, from pollutant removal to effluent discharge, adhere to the mandated environmental standards. This commitment extends to regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms, ensuring ongoing compliance and adaptation to any legal updates.\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project aligns with Iraq's key environmental laws, especially Law No. 27 of 2009. This law is the main legal document that outlines the environmental considerations for any project or activity to be carried out in the Country. \nAs per the requirements of The Iraqi Environmental protection and Enhancement Law no. 27 for year 2009, our team undertake to fulfill all the requirements such as\nConduct an EIA (Environment Impact Analysis) study prior to the commencement of any project activities.\nGet the prior approval of the Ministry of Environment (MoEn) before starting the project as per articles 10 & 11 of the Law no. 27 for 2009.\nProvide and implement pollution control measures using clean. technologies, this is to be associated to ensure the proper performance of these control measures, as per article 9 of the same law.\nProvide tools for measuring the levels of pollutants. Records should be kept and made available to MoEn when needed. If such tools cannot be provided by the establishment, the MoEn performs these measurements, as per article 9 of the same law.\nBuild a database for environmental protection and sustainability, as per article 9 of the same law.\nReduce pollution through using renewable energy technologies, as per article 9 of the same law.\nWe also undertake to fulfill the requirements of any other legislation and regulations imposed by the relevant Iraqi government organization for the protection of water resources.\n3.5 Sludge Management and Disposal  \nThe Vertical Treatment Shaft, when implemented and in operation, will capture almost all the solids (TSS) and organic contaminants (BOD) from going into the river as it is the case currently.  This will be achieved by the primary treatment in the first shaft and secondary treatment using the DAF system for solids separation in the second shaft.   Skimming and settled primary solids from the first shaft (estimated to be 1.5% dry solids) will be pumped to the sludge storage/thickening tank. The waste activated sludge from the DAF’s (expected to be approximately 3% dry solids) will be diverted from the return activated sludge line from the DAFs to the sludge storage/thickening tank. Primary sludge and secondary sludge will be thickened in the sludge storage/thickener tank. The combined thickened sludge will pass through dry solids screw presses, with the dried solids (20% dry solids) being deposited by conveyor into either a dump body truck or a roll-off container. The remaining effluent discharges will meet the water TSS and BOD limits as stated in the project objectives. The projected amount of  solids at 20% dry solids is estimated to be 1,300 tonnes per day which will bring huge improvement to water quality in the river.  Dried solids could be treated using dry bed area and could be used as a fertilizer after testing for incompatible pollutants.  \nWe propose that the drying beds at the Al Rustemiya Plant in Baghdad can be effectively utilized for the drying of the sludge generated from the two vertical treatment shafts at Medical City and the Al Zuyut Factory. Utilizing the existing infrastructure at the Al Rustemiya Plant presents a practical solution for managing the sludge produced by the wastewater treatment process. By repurposing these drying beds, we can streamline the sludge disposal process and ensure efficient handling of the waste material. This collaborative approach underscores our commitment to maximizing resource utilization and optimizing the operations of our wastewater treatment facilities in Baghdad.\n3.6 Potential Nationwide Benefits\nUtilizing this technology we see the following national benefits:\nScalability Across Diverse Geographies: The compact nature and minimal land use requirement of the Treatment Shaft make it an ideal solution for both densely populated urban areas and rural settings across Iraq. Its adaptability to different site conditions and capacities means that this solution can be scaled up or down, catering to the needs of various communities throughout the country.\nCost-Effective Infrastructure Development: The Treatment Shaft technology stands out for its cost efficiency, particularly in areas where land acquisition is challenging or financially prohibitive. By minimizing the need for extensive piping and reducing the space required for wastewater treatment facilities, this solution can lead to significant savings in infrastructure development and maintenance costs nationwide.\nEnvironmental Protection and Public Health: The deployment of the Treatment Shaft technology across Iraq has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of water bodies by treating wastewater to national discharge standards. This, in turn, benefits public health, supports agriculture, and preserves the natural beauty and environmental integrity of Iraq's diverse landscapes.\nA Model for Sustainable Development: By adopting this innovative wastewater treatment technology, Iraq can position itself as a leader in sustainable water management in the region. The Treatment Shaft solution offers a practical model for addressing pressing environmental challenges while supporting economic growth and enhancing the quality of life for its citizens.\n3.7 Local Impact of Medical City's Wastewater Discharge on the Tigris River\n\nRecent studies have underscored the alarming impact of wastewater discharge from Baghdad's Medical City on the Tigris River, a crucial water source for Iraq. The research by Al Satar and Sachit from Al-Mustansiriyah University specifically investigated the change in heavy metals concentrations in the Tigris River due to this discharge. Sampling water at three strategic points - upstream, at the discharge point, and downstream - they found a marked increase in heavy metal concentrations, including Pb, Cd, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Ag, particularly at the downstream point. This is a clear indication of the pollution load being added to the river by the hospital's wastewater.\nAnother study by Al-Obaidy et al. focused on assessing the overall water quality of the Tigris River within Baghdad, taking into account the effluents from both the Medical City and Al-Rasheed Power Plant. The application of the Water Quality Index (WQI) based on various parameters such as pH, Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), and others, revealed that the water quality ranged from very poor to unsuitable in different seasons. This degradation in water quality not only poses significant health risks to the local population, reliant on the river for various needs, but also threatens the river's aquatic life and ecological balance.\nThe findings from these studies make it evident that the discharge of untreated wastewater from Medical City is contributing significantly to the pollution of the Tigris River. This situation demands immediate attention and action, not only to protect public health but also to preserve the ecological integrity of this vital waterway. The government's intervention in implementing effective wastewater treatment solutions is imperative to mitigate these risks and ensure the long-term sustainability of the Tigris River as a crucial resource for Iraq.\n3.8 Environmental Impact Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project represents a pivotal milestone in Iraq's pursuit of sustainable environmental management. Addressing the pressing environmental challenges in the Medical City area, this project introduces an advanced treatment shaft technology while ensuring strict adherence to Iraq's environmental laws. As the project progresses through the stages of development, each build will bring improvements to water quality, underscoring our commitment to long-term environmental preservation and the protection of the Tigris River.\nThe vertical treatment plant will be able to treat the effluent (waste water discharge) in the first year after the completion of the first shaft. Slowing the processes of polluting the river and reducing the damage to Dicle(Tigris) without waiting for the completion of the whole project.\nFinally, this report serves as compelling evidence of the feasibility, cost-saving, and land-saving advantages offered by our joint venture team's EPA award-winning and patented vertical shaft Wastewater Treatment Technology Solution. Through our collective efforts, we pave the way for a sustainable future, embodying Iraq's commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project represents a pivotal milestone in Iraq's pursuit of sustainable environmental management. Addressing the pressing environmental challenges in the Medical City area, this project introduces an advanced treatment shaft technology while ensuring strict adherence to Iraq's environmental laws. As the project progresses through the stages of development, each build will bring improvements to water quality, underscoring our commitment to long-term environmental preservation and the protection of the Tigris River.\n",

This patented technology stands out for its ability to treat large volumes of wastewater effectively in small spaces, marking a significant advancement in water treatment efficiency. We'll examine its distinctive features, proven success, and the wide-ranging benefits it brings to communities and the environment.\nAdditionally, we will present an overview of the technology and the projects that have been completed, as well as a list of patents granted to Dr. Ghalib related to this technology in the USA and internationally, including Japan, South Korea, Canada, and most recently in Iraq. \nThis document is submitted to the Municipality of Baghdad to support the preparation of a contract for the design, construction, and operation of two key projects: \nThe Medical City Pump Station (T1) Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)\nThe Zuyut Factory Pump Station (TS1) WWTP.\n\n4.1 Submitted Proposal Design-Build-Operate\n\nIn late 2023, our team submitted a design-build-operate proposal for the Medical City WWTP, utilizing the vertical Treatment Shaft patented technology. Prior to commencing the design, a pilot study will be conducted on-site using actual wastewater flows from the pump station to validate our assumptions and refine the design. \nThis approach has been successfully applied in the US, notably by Professor Steve Right at the University of Michigan hydraulic laboratory. Our team comprises highly skilled firms with expertise in their respective fields, including a design consultant, a quality assurance consultant, specialized construction companies for diaphragm wall construction, and manufacturing companies from the USA, Turkey, and other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Water Engineering Technologies\n\nFounded in 2012 by Dr. Ghalib, Water Engineering Technologies (WET) is dedicated to enhancing sanitation and water quality around the world. WET’s invention, the Treatment Shaft, is a pioneering technology that helps to prevent human contact with waste and effectively treat sewage and other wastewaters. The Treatment Shaft, a creation of WET, addresses many shortcomings of existing solutions efficiently and cost-effectively. It has earned recognition as an “Emerging Technology” by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), the US federal regulatory environmental agency, and has won several awards for its innovation in the wastewater treatment sector.\n\n4.3 Treatment Shaft Technology  \nThe Treatment Shaft Technology, featuring a vertical design, achieves efficient wastewater treatment in a smaller area and at a lower cost compared to traditional methods. This technology, proven effective in treating wastewater discharges, also helps reduce pollution's impact on water resources.\nIts smaller footprint, about 75% to 80% less than conventional WWTPs, along with its cost-effectiveness, makes it a suitable alternative for communities where space is limited and budgets are constrained. The system's flexible design allows adaptation to various flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits, making it a versatile solution. It also offers significant advantages such as lower capital and operational costs, greatly reduced footprint, and more reliable odor control due to limited air exposure.The technology has received many patents in the US, Japan, South Korea and more and more recently in Iraq. The Treatment Shaft technology has been proven to treat wastewater discharges and eliminate pollution impact on water resources. \nThe high cost and extensive maintenance of WWTP makes it uneconomical for many communities, especially in developing countries. Therefore, they discharge their sanitary sewers directly to rivers and surface waters without even basic treatment. Compared to the traditional alternatives commonly used to address sanitary sewer discharges, the Treatment Shaft technology was developed to provide an alternative that municipalities could afford within their budget and at places where space is limited and odor emission is problematic.\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant introduces this technology to Iraq, designed to occupy about 20% of the space required by a conventional Treatment Plant. It effectively reduces pollutants, aligning with WHO and Iraqi water discharge standards. Water Engineering Technologies (WET) offers two levels of treatment with this technology: the Treatment Shaft (TS) for primary treatment, including skimming, settling, screening, and disinfection, and the Dual Treatment Shaft (DTS) for secondary and tertiary treatment, suitable for municipal wastewater and effluent water reuse.\n\nWater Engineering Technologies (WET) has two technologies for wastewater treatment that provide two levels of treatment, these are:\n\nTreatment Shaft (TS) technology for primary treatment that provides skimming, settling, screening and disinfection for most of the pollutants for safe discharge to surface water (Figure 1).\nDual Treatment Shaft (DTS) technology for providing (in addition to primary treatment) secondary and treasury treatment for municipal wastewater and for effluent water reuse for restricted irrigation (Figure 2).\n\n\n\tFigure 1 – Treatment Shaft\t\t    \tFigure 2 - Double Treatment Shaft\t\n\nThe Treatment Shaft has received acclaim and awards from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, trade magazines as well as letters from the city.  WET’s Qualifications and Awards below are presented in Section 4.8. \nThe vertical Shaft system would provide a complete treatment for municipal wastewater. Its flexible design could be adopted to treat different flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits.  The Treatment Shaft replaces all components of a conventional treatment system in fewer structures.  The advantages of the Dual Treatment Shaft are:\nLower capital and operational cost by combining many components into fewer structures and less equipment property cost.\nFraction of the footprint than any conventional wastewater treatment system.\nMuch more reliable odor control because of its limited ambient air exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Comparative Analysis\nWhat follows, is a comparative study between the newly awarded traditional Wastewater Treatment Plant (Al Khansa in Baghdad) by the municipality of Baghdad, sewerage department and  the proposed Medical City/Al Zuyut Vertical Wastewater Treatment Plant.  This comparison will address the technical, cost and space requirements aspects of the two alternatives.  This comparison shows that the Vertical Treatment Shaft has a similar or higher level of treatment than conventional systems with much less cost, less  land use, and complete odor control.  \nTechnical Comparison\nThe following table compares the  traditional Wastewater Treatment Plant critical technical design criteria and the proposed innovative Medical City/Al Zuyut Wastewater Treatment Plant using Vertical Treatment Shaft.  As shown on the table,  there is a similarity between the two criteria, however the Vertical Treatment Shaft uses a different arrangement of the main treatment components and processes to be located  in fewer and deeper structures that will save on cost and uses a fraction of land needed. \nComponents\nVertical Treatment Shaft\nTraditional WWTP\n1.

Solid Handling Unit\nSludge dewatering and Thickener\nSludge dewatering and Thickener\nSolid Disposal\nOff Site\nOff Site\n\nCapacity \nThe Al Khansa Wastewater treatment plant was designed with a Capacity Of 200,000 ㎥/Day.  It is located at the end of the northeastern main sewage line  on the banks of the Diyala River within the Alfadhiliya area.  \nIn comparison, the Medical City proposed Wastewater Treatment Plant will be designed for 182,000 ㎥/Day for sanitary waste flow during dry weather condition and 900,000  ㎥/Day.  for combined flow (sanitary and storm) during wet weather conditions.  \n\n\nCost Comparison\nThe Al Khansa Wastewater Treatment Plant was designed for a treatment capacity of 200,000 ㎥/day.  The construction cost for this project was awarded for 223 million USD. To our understanding, this does not include the cost of feasibility study, design and operation.  This unit cost is equivalent to 1,115 USD/㎥/day of treated wastewater (223,000,000 / 200,000) \nOn the other hand, the Medical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Shaft treatment capacity of  182,000 ㎥/day total cost is 146,651,127 million USD inclusive of feasibility study, design, and operation management:   This unit cost is equivalent to 1,115 USD/㎥/day of treated wastewater (146,651,127/ 182,000) .\n\nLand Requirements\nThe Al Khansa Wastewater Treatment Plant is designed to be built on an area of  126,607 ㎡ (51 dunums). The area available for the Medical City Vertical Treatment Shaft treatment is a parcel of 100 m by 100 m (10,000 ㎡ or 4 dunums).  This is the only parcel of land that the municipality could acquire next to the Medical City Complex. This will preclude using any traditional WasteWater Treatment option that requires a much larger area.  The following provides a drawing showing the comparison of the footprint of the Vertical Treatment Shaft proposed to the Medical City project compared to traditional treatment represented by Al Khansa project and proposed location for the Medical City WWTP at the available land next to the Medical City complex.  \n\n\n\n\nFootprint and space allocated for the Al khansa (51 Dunums) and Medical City WWTPs (4 Dunums) (NEED TO PUT THE AREA OF OUR VERTICAL TREATMENT ON THE ABOVE PLOT FOR COMPARISON AND NOT ONLY ON ITS OWN\n\nMedical City WWTP Proposed Construction Site on a 4 Dunums Lot Next to the Medical City Complex in Baghdad\nOdor Control\nWhile improving the quality of the water, urban sewage plants have brought problems to its surrounding environment, the most typical of which is the problem of odor pollution. The Al Khansa WWTP uses oxidation ditches typical for conventional treatment plant design that emits unacceptable odors during operation especially next to the Medical City Complex in the center of the capital Baghdad and very close to the Tigris River that could be developed in the future to a park.  Al Khansa WWTP was designed to use conventional Aeration Chambers for treatment.  These chambers are open surface tanks that agitate the sewage water as it passes through it with rotating brushes.  This process produces a great amount of odors to the ambient air.  \n\n\nAl Khansa WWTP -Uses 24 Oxidation Ditches that cause source of odor.\nOdor control for the Medical  City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants will be provided by enclosing the headworks and sludge dewatering equipment in the headworks building.  Shaft 1 will also be covered.  Fresh air for these enclosed areas will be provided and form the input to the activated sludge aeration compressors.  This will result in the odors emanating from these enclosed portions of the plant to be deodorized by the mixed liquor. \nOdor is one of the negative impacts of any wastewater treatment facility and especially in congested areas like the Medical Center area.  Because of the compact nature of the Treatment Shaft and the facility is not spread out and limited to only a few structures, providing cover for the facility is an effective way of controlling odor emission.  Air ventilation from the space below the cover will reduce odor escaping outside.  Exhaust air will be directed to the air blower for the aeration chamber for treatment.   \n\nMedical City WWTP Uses Covers and Treat Odor in the Headspace Air (No Discharge to Ambient Atmosphere)\n\n4.8 Treatment Shaft Qualifications and Awards\n\nThe United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\nlisted the Treatment Shaft as an “Emerging Technology” in their Engineering Technology Manual\n\nThe Treatment Shaft was recognized as an innovative Emerging Technology in the “United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)’s Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management” Manual in 2013 document issued March, 2013. View online here on page 4-1 or see documentation below:\n\nThe \"United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management\" manual, published in 2013, explores cutting-edge innovations in wastewater treatment and management. This comprehensive document highlights emerging technologies aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes, particularly during periods of wet weather.\nThis includes award-winning technology involving a comprehensive process encompassing pre-treatment, primary and secondary treatment phases, and a final disinfection stage. Each phase is meticulously designed to efficiently reduce specific pollutants. By modeling the improvements in water markers for the Medical City site, we are confident that we can not only meet but also exceed the WHO and Iraqi legal standards for water discharge quality. Through the incorporation of advanced techniques and methodologies outlined in the EPA manual, we aim to address evolving challenges in wastewater management while promoting environmental sustainability and public health protection.\n\nUnited State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\n\nAward: EPA Performance and Innovation Creating Environmental Success\n\nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), the environmental regulatory agency in the State of Michigan, has nominated Dr. Ghalib for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for State Revolving Fund Creating Environmental Success (PISCES) Award” which was granted for the savings provided to the City.

This section provides an in-depth analysis of the environmental issues at the Medical City site, focusing on the adverse impacts of wastewater contamination on the Tigris River. It combines research and legal analysis to present a comprehensive picture of the environmental and legal status surrounding the project. The section not only addresses the pressing water crisis in Iraq but also examines the project’s alignment with legal and environmental standards.\nExecutive Insights\nMarked Reduction in River Flows: Over the last 40 years, there has been a significant decline (30-40%) in the water flows of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, leading to exacerbated pollution concerns, particularly at the Medical City site​​.\nSignificant Contamination Impact: The contamination from Medical City, as observed through on-land assessments and satellite imagery, has notably affected the Tigris River. This contamination includes elevated levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater, exceeding the thresholds established by Iraqi environmental laws​​.\nResearch and Legal Compliance: Studies conducted by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain provide substantial evidence of the contamination levels. The project's approach to addressing these environmental issues is rigorously assessed for compliance with Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment, ensuring the project’s operations are within the ambit of national environmental mandates​​.\n\n3.1 Environmental and Legal Status  \n\nThe water crisis in Iraq, a pressing environmental concern, is highlighted by the marked reduction in water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris rivers over the last 40 years, declining by 30 to 40%. This decrease has exacerbated pollution concerns, particularly at the Medical City site. Notably, contamination from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, significantly impacts the Tigris River. Research by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants like biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater from Medical City, surpassing legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\n\n3.2. Current Environmental Status\nThe water crisis in Iraq sets a critical backdrop for environmental discussions, as highlighted by H.E. Abdul Latif Rashid at the UN Water Conference referencing that over the last 40 years water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris have decreased by 30 to 40%. With a marked reduction in river flows pollution concerns at the Medical City site become more and more important to address.\nOf particular significance is the contamination originating from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, and notably impacting the Tigris River. \nAggregated contaminated water from Medical City is seen exiting into the Tigris River\nSatellite observations of polluted water emanating from Medical City outfall (dark color).\n\nResearch conducted by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain, as documented in papers with reference numbers ISSN: 1735-3866 and ISSN: 2412-0758(Number ISSN: 1735-3866 and Number ISSN: 2412-0758 respectively)\n\nIn these papers, it provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater discharged from Medical City. These levels surpass legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\nStudies such as \"Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the Medical City on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq\" by Abdullah M. Ahmed and Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani, and \"Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River\" by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah, and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi, further corroborate these findings. Notably, the mean value of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exceeds permissible limits, indicating a severe deterioration in water quality.\n\nNote: S2 is site two, at the Medical City outfall\nReference: Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the medical city on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq Abdullah M. Ahmed*, Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani https://doi.org/10.22124/cjes.2024.7447\nThe mean value of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exceeds permissible limits, indicating a deterioration in water quality.\nReference: “Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River” by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi  https://doi.org/10.30684/etj.34.3B.8\n\n\nIn light of global trends and local data, it becomes evident that strategic improvements in wastewater treatment are required. Enhanced treatment methods are essential to not only address the immediate concerns related to Medical City's outfall but also to contribute to the larger objective of mitigating Iraq's water challenges.\n\n3.3 Environmental, Social & Financial Impact\nWastewater mismanagement poses significant environmental, social, and financial threats. By contaminating natural water bodies and reducing arable land, it endangers human health and wildlife while undermining economic activities reliant on clean water. This project's investment in advanced treatment will yield substantial benefits by averting ecological damage and fostering economic prosperity through cleaner water resources.  \nThis process of dumping wastewater into the natural water supply poses hazards not only to human health, but can also have a devastating effect on wildlife, especially for fish and other animals in the water. Harmful substances in water can also get into fields and soil, which results in smaller crop yields for farmers. \nThe damage to ecosystems due to excessive wastewater discharges has impacts beyond the environment. Economic impacts, such as pumping waste water without treatment into Dijlah river, will cause losses to the population since river water is used for drinking and manufacturing activities and river banks normally are invested for recreation, commercial and employment opportunities. \nIn the economic analysis of this investment, the ecological externalities of the project were monetized, starting from the assumption that the wastewater treatment process is a process that has desired output—treated water. Their estimated value, determined by “shadow prices'', actually represents the avoided damage/costs, i.e., the realized benefit/income for the environment as a result of the removal of pollutants during treatment in the WWTP (Wastewater Treatment Plant).\nThe difference between the pollution costs for wastewater and the pollution costs for treated water represents the realized savings in the cost of pollution, i.e., environmental benefits. For example, the suspended particles. The final results of the conducted economic cost-benefit analysis unequivocally indicate the full socio-economic justification for the investment. At the same time, the sensitivity analysis proved that the project is resistant to possible changes in input parameters over time.\n\n3.4 Legal Status and Compliance\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project is set within a robust legal framework that reflects Iraq's long-standing and evolving commitment to environmental stewardship. This includes adherence to historical legislations like Regulation No. (25) of 1967, which underscores Iraq's early initiatives in preserving its water resources. \nThe project is a testament to Iraq's enduring and progressive environmental governance. It embodies the principles of historical legislations and aligns with contemporary legal obligations, such as Iraq's commitment to the UN Water Convention, ensuring the project's operations remain within the ambit of national and international environmental mandates.  \nOur project prioritizes legal compliance throughout its design and operational phases. We ensure that all aspects of wastewater treatment, from pollutant removal to effluent discharge, adhere to the mandated environmental standards. This commitment extends to regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms, ensuring ongoing compliance and adaptation to any legal updates.\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project aligns with Iraq's key environmental laws, especially Law No. 27 of 2009. This law is the main legal document that outlines the environmental considerations for any project or activity to be carried out in the Country. \nAs per the requirements of The Iraqi Environmental protection and Enhancement Law no. 27 for year 2009, our team undertake to fulfill all the requirements such as\nConduct an EIA (Environment Impact Analysis) study prior to the commencement of any project activities.\nGet the prior approval of the Ministry of Environment (MoEn) before starting the project as per articles 10 & 11 of the Law no. 27 for 2009.\nProvide and implement pollution control measures using clean. technologies, this is to be associated to ensure the proper performance of these control measures, as per article 9 of the same law.\nProvide tools for measuring the levels of pollutants. Records should be kept and made available to MoEn when needed. If such tools cannot be provided by the establishment, the MoEn performs these measurements, as per article 9 of the same law.\nBuild a database for environmental protection and sustainability, as per article 9 of the same law.\nReduce pollution through using renewable energy technologies, as per article 9 of the same law.\nWe also undertake to fulfill the requirements of any other legislation and regulations imposed by the relevant Iraqi government organization for the protection of water resources.\n3.5 Sludge Management and Disposal  \nThe Vertical Treatment Shaft, when implemented and in operation, will capture almost all the solids (TSS) and organic contaminants (BOD) from going into the river as it is the case currently.  This will be achieved by the primary treatment in the first shaft and secondary treatment using the DAF system for solids separation in the second shaft.   Skimming and settled primary solids from the first shaft (estimated to be 1.5% dry solids) will be pumped to the sludge storage/thickening tank. The waste activated sludge from the DAF’s (expected to be approximately 3% dry solids) will be diverted from the return activated sludge line from the DAFs to the sludge storage/thickening tank. Primary sludge and secondary sludge will be thickened in the sludge storage/thickener tank. The combined thickened sludge will pass through dry solids screw presses, with the dried solids (20% dry solids) being deposited by conveyor into either a dump body truck or a roll-off container. The remaining effluent discharges will meet the water TSS and BOD limits as stated in the project objectives. The projected amount of  solids at 20% dry solids is estimated to be 1,300 tonnes per day which will bring huge improvement to water quality in the river.  Dried solids could be treated using dry bed area and could be used as a fertilizer after testing for incompatible pollutants.  \nWe propose that the drying beds at the Al Rustemiya Plant in Baghdad can be effectively utilized for the drying of the sludge generated from the two vertical treatment shafts at Medical City and the Al Zuyut Factory. Utilizing the existing infrastructure at the Al Rustemiya Plant presents a practical solution for managing the sludge produced by the wastewater treatment process. By repurposing these drying beds, we can streamline the sludge disposal process and ensure efficient handling of the waste material. This collaborative approach underscores our commitment to maximizing resource utilization and optimizing the operations of our wastewater treatment facilities in Baghdad.\n3.6 Potential Nationwide Benefits\nUtilizing this technology we see the following national benefits:\nScalability Across Diverse Geographies: The compact nature and minimal land use requirement of the Treatment Shaft make it an ideal solution for both densely populated urban areas and rural settings across Iraq. Its adaptability to different site conditions and capacities means that this solution can be scaled up or down, catering to the needs of various communities throughout the country.\nCost-Effective Infrastructure Development: The Treatment Shaft technology stands out for its cost efficiency, particularly in areas where land acquisition is challenging or financially prohibitive. By minimizing the need for extensive piping and reducing the space required for wastewater treatment facilities, this solution can lead to significant savings in infrastructure development and maintenance costs nationwide.\nEnvironmental Protection and Public Health: The deployment of the Treatment Shaft technology across Iraq has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of water bodies by treating wastewater to national discharge standards. This, in turn, benefits public health, supports agriculture, and preserves the natural beauty and environmental integrity of Iraq's diverse landscapes.\nA Model for Sustainable Development: By adopting this innovative wastewater treatment technology, Iraq can position itself as a leader in sustainable water management in the region. The Treatment Shaft solution offers a practical model for addressing pressing environmental challenges while supporting economic growth and enhancing the quality of life for its citizens.\n3.7 Local Impact of Medical City's Wastewater Discharge on the Tigris River\n\nRecent studies have underscored the alarming impact of wastewater discharge from Baghdad's Medical City on the Tigris River, a crucial water source for Iraq. The research by Al Satar and Sachit from Al-Mustansiriyah University specifically investigated the change in heavy metals concentrations in the Tigris River due to this discharge. Sampling water at three strategic points - upstream, at the discharge point, and downstream - they found a marked increase in heavy metal concentrations, including Pb, Cd, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Ag, particularly at the downstream point. This is a clear indication of the pollution load being added to the river by the hospital's wastewater.\nAnother study by Al-Obaidy et al. focused on assessing the overall water quality of the Tigris River within Baghdad, taking into account the effluents from both the Medical City and Al-Rasheed Power Plant. The application of the Water Quality Index (WQI) based on various parameters such as pH, Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), and others, revealed that the water quality ranged from very poor to unsuitable in different seasons. This degradation in water quality not only poses significant health risks to the local population, reliant on the river for various needs, but also threatens the river's aquatic life and ecological balance.\nThe findings from these studies make it evident that the discharge of untreated wastewater from Medical City is contributing significantly to the pollution of the Tigris River. This situation demands immediate attention and action, not only to protect public health but also to preserve the ecological integrity of this vital waterway. The government's intervention in implementing effective wastewater treatment solutions is imperative to mitigate these risks and ensure the long-term sustainability of the Tigris River as a crucial resource for Iraq.\n3.8 Environmental Impact Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project represents a pivotal milestone in Iraq's pursuit of sustainable environmental management. Addressing the pressing environmental challenges in the Medical City area, this project introduces an advanced treatment shaft technology while ensuring strict adherence to Iraq's environmental laws. As the project progresses through the stages of development, each build will bring improvements to water quality, underscoring our commitment to long-term environmental preservation and the protection of the Tigris River.\nThe vertical treatment plant will be able to treat the effluent (waste water discharge) in the first year after the completion of the first shaft. Slowing the processes of polluting the river and reducing the damage to Dicle(Tigris) without waiting for the completion of the whole project.\nFinally, this report serves as compelling evidence of the feasibility, cost-saving, and land-saving advantages offered by our joint venture team's EPA award-winning and patented vertical shaft Wastewater Treatment Technology Solution. Through our collective efforts, we pave the way for a sustainable future, embodying Iraq's commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project represents a pivotal milestone in Iraq's pursuit of sustainable environmental management.

This patented technology stands out for its ability to treat large volumes of wastewater effectively in small spaces, marking a significant advancement in water treatment efficiency. We'll examine its distinctive features, proven success, and the wide-ranging benefits it brings to communities and the environment.\nAdditionally, we will present an overview of the technology and the projects that have been completed, as well as a list of patents granted to Dr. Ghalib related to this technology in the USA and internationally, including Japan, South Korea, Canada, and most recently in Iraq. \nThis document is submitted to the Municipality of Baghdad to support the preparation of a contract for the design, construction, and operation of two key projects: \nThe Medical City Pump Station (T1) Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)\nThe Zuyut Factory Pump Station (TS1) WWTP.\n\n4.1 Submitted Proposal Design-Build-Operate\n\nIn late 2023, our team submitted a design-build-operate proposal for the Medical City WWTP, utilizing the vertical Treatment Shaft patented technology. Prior to commencing the design, a pilot study will be conducted on-site using actual wastewater flows from the pump station to validate our assumptions and refine the design. \nThis approach has been successfully applied in the US, notably by Professor Steve Right at the University of Michigan hydraulic laboratory. Our team comprises highly skilled firms with expertise in their respective fields, including a design consultant, a quality assurance consultant, specialized construction companies for diaphragm wall construction, and manufacturing companies from the USA, Turkey, and other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Water Engineering Technologies\n\nFounded in 2012 by Dr. Ghalib, Water Engineering Technologies (WET) is dedicated to enhancing sanitation and water quality around the world. WET’s invention, the Treatment Shaft, is a pioneering technology that helps to prevent human contact with waste and effectively treat sewage and other wastewaters. The Treatment Shaft, a creation of WET, addresses many shortcomings of existing solutions efficiently and cost-effectively. It has earned recognition as an “Emerging Technology” by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), the US federal regulatory environmental agency, and has won several awards for its innovation in the wastewater treatment sector.\n\n4.3 Treatment Shaft Technology  \nThe Treatment Shaft Technology, featuring a vertical design, achieves efficient wastewater treatment in a smaller area and at a lower cost compared to traditional methods. This technology, proven effective in treating wastewater discharges, also helps reduce pollution's impact on water resources.\nIts smaller footprint, about 75% to 80% less than conventional WWTPs, along with its cost-effectiveness, makes it a suitable alternative for communities where space is limited and budgets are constrained. The system's flexible design allows adaptation to various flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits, making it a versatile solution. It also offers significant advantages such as lower capital and operational costs, greatly reduced footprint, and more reliable odor control due to limited air exposure.The technology has received many patents in the US, Japan, South Korea and more and more recently in Iraq. The Treatment Shaft technology has been proven to treat wastewater discharges and eliminate pollution impact on water resources. \nThe high cost and extensive maintenance of WWTP makes it uneconomical for many communities, especially in developing countries. Therefore, they discharge their sanitary sewers directly to rivers and surface waters without even basic treatment. Compared to the traditional alternatives commonly used to address sanitary sewer discharges, the Treatment Shaft technology was developed to provide an alternative that municipalities could afford within their budget and at places where space is limited and odor emission is problematic.\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant introduces this technology to Iraq, designed to occupy about 20% of the space required by a conventional Treatment Plant. It effectively reduces pollutants, aligning with WHO and Iraqi water discharge standards. Water Engineering Technologies (WET) offers two levels of treatment with this technology: the Treatment Shaft (TS) for primary treatment, including skimming, settling, screening, and disinfection, and the Dual Treatment Shaft (DTS) for secondary and tertiary treatment, suitable for municipal wastewater and effluent water reuse.\n\nWater Engineering Technologies (WET) has two technologies for wastewater treatment that provide two levels of treatment, these are:\n\nTreatment Shaft (TS) technology for primary treatment that provides skimming, settling, screening and disinfection for most of the pollutants for safe discharge to surface water (Figure 1).\nDual Treatment Shaft (DTS) technology for providing (in addition to primary treatment) secondary and treasury treatment for municipal wastewater and for effluent water reuse for restricted irrigation (Figure 2).\n\n\n\tFigure 1 – Treatment Shaft\t\t    \tFigure 2 - Double Treatment Shaft\t\n\nThe Treatment Shaft has received acclaim and awards from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, trade magazines as well as letters from the city.  WET’s Qualifications and Awards below are presented in Section 4.8. \nThe vertical Shaft system would provide a complete treatment for municipal wastewater. Its flexible design could be adopted to treat different flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits.  The Treatment Shaft replaces all components of a conventional treatment system in fewer structures.  The advantages of the Dual Treatment Shaft are:\nLower capital and operational cost by combining many components into fewer structures and less equipment property cost.\nFraction of the footprint than any conventional wastewater treatment system.\nMuch more reliable odor control because of its limited ambient air exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Comparative Analysis\nWhat follows, is a comparative study between the newly awarded traditional Wastewater Treatment Plant (Al Khansa in Baghdad) by the municipality of Baghdad, sewerage department and  the proposed Medical City/Al Zuyut Vertical Wastewater Treatment Plant.  This comparison will address the technical, cost and space requirements aspects of the two alternatives.  This comparison shows that the Vertical Treatment Shaft has a similar or higher level of treatment than conventional systems with much less cost, less  land use, and complete odor control.  \nTechnical Comparison\nThe following table compares the  traditional Wastewater Treatment Plant critical technical design criteria and the proposed innovative Medical City/Al Zuyut Wastewater Treatment Plant using Vertical Treatment Shaft.  As shown on the table,  there is a similarity between the two criteria, however the Vertical Treatment Shaft uses a different arrangement of the main treatment components and processes to be located  in fewer and deeper structures that will save on cost and uses a fraction of land needed. \nComponents\nVertical Treatment Shaft\nTraditional WWTP\n1.

Solid Handling Unit\nSludge dewatering and Thickener\nSludge dewatering and Thickener\nSolid Disposal\nOff Site\nOff Site\n\nCapacity \nThe Al Khansa Wastewater treatment plant was designed with a Capacity Of 200,000 ㎥/Day.  It is located at the end of the northeastern main sewage line  on the banks of the Diyala River within the Alfadhiliya area.  \nIn comparison, the Medical City proposed Wastewater Treatment Plant will be designed for 182,000 ㎥/Day for sanitary waste flow during dry weather condition and 900,000  ㎥/Day.  for combined flow (sanitary and storm) during wet weather conditions.  \n\n\nCost Comparison\nThe Al Khansa Wastewater Treatment Plant was designed for a treatment capacity of 200,000 ㎥/day.  The construction cost for this project was awarded for 223 million USD. To our understanding, this does not include the cost of feasibility study, design and operation.  This unit cost is equivalent to 1,115 USD/㎥/day of treated wastewater (223,000,000 / 200,000) \nOn the other hand, the Medical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Shaft treatment capacity of  182,000 ㎥/day total cost is 146,651,127 million USD inclusive of feasibility study, design, and operation management:   This unit cost is equivalent to 1,115 USD/㎥/day of treated wastewater (146,651,127/ 182,000) .\n\nLand Requirements\nThe Al Khansa Wastewater Treatment Plant is designed to be built on an area of  126,607 ㎡ (51 dunums). The area available for the Medical City Vertical Treatment Shaft treatment is a parcel of 100 m by 100 m (10,000 ㎡ or 4 dunums).  This is the only parcel of land that the municipality could acquire next to the Medical City Complex. This will preclude using any traditional WasteWater Treatment option that requires a much larger area.  The following provides a drawing showing the comparison of the footprint of the Vertical Treatment Shaft proposed to the Medical City project compared to traditional treatment represented by Al Khansa project and proposed location for the Medical City WWTP at the available land next to the Medical City complex.  \n\n\n\n\nFootprint and space allocated for the Al khansa (51 Dunums) and Medical City WWTPs (4 Dunums) (NEED TO PUT THE AREA OF OUR VERTICAL TREATMENT ON THE ABOVE PLOT FOR COMPARISON AND NOT ONLY ON ITS OWN\n\nMedical City WWTP Proposed Construction Site on a 4 Dunums Lot Next to the Medical City Complex in Baghdad\nOdor Control\nWhile improving the quality of the water, urban sewage plants have brought problems to its surrounding environment, the most typical of which is the problem of odor pollution. The Al Khansa WWTP uses oxidation ditches typical for conventional treatment plant design that emits unacceptable odors during operation especially next to the Medical City Complex in the center of the capital Baghdad and very close to the Tigris River that could be developed in the future to a park.  Al Khansa WWTP was designed to use conventional Aeration Chambers for treatment.  These chambers are open surface tanks that agitate the sewage water as it passes through it with rotating brushes.  This process produces a great amount of odors to the ambient air.  \n\n\nAl Khansa WWTP -Uses 24 Oxidation Ditches that cause source of odor.\nOdor control for the Medical  City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants will be provided by enclosing the headworks and sludge dewatering equipment in the headworks building.  Shaft 1 will also be covered.  Fresh air for these enclosed areas will be provided and form the input to the activated sludge aeration compressors.  This will result in the odors emanating from these enclosed portions of the plant to be deodorized by the mixed liquor. \nOdor is one of the negative impacts of any wastewater treatment facility and especially in congested areas like the Medical Center area.  Because of the compact nature of the Treatment Shaft and the facility is not spread out and limited to only a few structures, providing cover for the facility is an effective way of controlling odor emission.  Air ventilation from the space below the cover will reduce odor escaping outside.  Exhaust air will be directed to the air blower for the aeration chamber for treatment.   \n\nMedical City WWTP Uses Covers and Treat Odor in the Headspace Air (No Discharge to Ambient Atmosphere)\n\n4.8 Treatment Shaft Qualifications and Awards\n\nThe United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\nlisted the Treatment Shaft as an “Emerging Technology” in their Engineering Technology Manual\n\nThe Treatment Shaft was recognized as an innovative Emerging Technology in the “United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)’s Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management” Manual in 2013 document issued March, 2013. View online here on page 4-1 or see documentation below:\n\nThe \"United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management\" manual, published in 2013, explores cutting-edge innovations in wastewater treatment and management. This comprehensive document highlights emerging technologies aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes, particularly during periods of wet weather.\nThis includes award-winning technology involving a comprehensive process encompassing pre-treatment, primary and secondary treatment phases, and a final disinfection stage.

This patented technology stands out for its ability to treat large volumes of wastewater effectively in small spaces, marking a significant advancement in water treatment efficiency. We'll examine its distinctive features, proven success, and the wide-ranging benefits it brings to communities and the environment.\nAdditionally, we will present an overview of the technology and the projects that have been completed, as well as a list of patents granted to Dr. Ghalib related to this technology in the USA and internationally, including Japan, South Korea, Canada, and most recently in Iraq. \nThis document is submitted to the Municipality of Baghdad to support the preparation of a contract for the design, construction, and operation of two key projects: \nThe Medical City Pump Station (T1) Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)\nThe Zuyut Factory Pump Station (TS1) WWTP.\n\n4.1 Submitted Proposal Design-Build-Operate\n\nIn late 2023, our team submitted a design-build-operate proposal for the Medical City WWTP, utilizing the vertical Treatment Shaft patented technology. Prior to commencing the design, a pilot study will be conducted on-site using actual wastewater flows from the pump station to validate our assumptions and refine the design. \nThis approach has been successfully applied in the US, notably by Professor Steve Right at the University of Michigan hydraulic laboratory. Our team comprises highly skilled firms with expertise in their respective fields, including a design consultant, a quality assurance consultant, specialized construction companies for diaphragm wall construction, and manufacturing companies from the USA, Turkey, and other countries.\n\n\n4.2 Water Engineering Technologies\n\nFounded in 2012 by Dr. Ghalib, Water Engineering Technologies (WET) is dedicated to enhancing sanitation and water quality around the world. WET’s invention, the Treatment Shaft, is a pioneering technology that helps to prevent human contact with waste and effectively treat sewage and other wastewaters. The Treatment Shaft, a creation of WET, addresses many shortcomings of existing solutions efficiently and cost-effectively. It has earned recognition as an “Emerging Technology” by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), the US federal regulatory environmental agency, and has won several awards for its innovation in the wastewater treatment sector.\n\n4.3 Treatment Shaft Technology  \nThe Treatment Shaft Technology, featuring a vertical design, achieves efficient wastewater treatment in a smaller area and at a lower cost compared to traditional methods. This technology, proven effective in treating wastewater discharges, also helps reduce pollution's impact on water resources.\nIts smaller footprint, about 75% to 80% less than conventional WWTPs, along with its cost-effectiveness, makes it a suitable alternative for communities where space is limited and budgets are constrained. The system's flexible design allows adaptation to various flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits, making it a versatile solution. It also offers significant advantages such as lower capital and operational costs, greatly reduced footprint, and more reliable odor control due to limited air exposure.The technology has received many patents in the US, Japan, South Korea and more and more recently in Iraq. The Treatment Shaft technology has been proven to treat wastewater discharges and eliminate pollution impact on water resources. \nThe high cost and extensive maintenance of WWTP makes it uneconomical for many communities, especially in developing countries. Therefore, they discharge their sanitary sewers directly to rivers and surface waters without even basic treatment. Compared to the traditional alternatives commonly used to address sanitary sewer discharges, the Treatment Shaft technology was developed to provide an alternative that municipalities could afford within their budget and at places where space is limited and odor emission is problematic.\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant introduces this technology to Iraq, designed to occupy about 20% of the space required by a conventional Treatment Plant. It effectively reduces pollutants, aligning with WHO and Iraqi water discharge standards. Water Engineering Technologies (WET) offers two levels of treatment with this technology: the Treatment Shaft (TS) for primary treatment, including skimming, settling, screening, and disinfection, and the Dual Treatment Shaft (DTS) for secondary and tertiary treatment, suitable for municipal wastewater and effluent water reuse.\n\nWater Engineering Technologies (WET) has two technologies for wastewater treatment that provide two levels of treatment, these are:\n\nTreatment Shaft (TS) technology for primary treatment that provides skimming, settling, screening and disinfection for most of the pollutants for safe discharge to surface water (Figure 1).\nDual Treatment Shaft (DTS) technology for providing (in addition to primary treatment) secondary and treasury treatment for municipal wastewater and for effluent water reuse for restricted irrigation (Figure 2).\n\n\n\tFigure 1 – Treatment Shaft\t\t    \tFigure 2 - Double Treatment Shaft\t\n\nThe Treatment Shaft has received acclaim and awards from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, trade magazines as well as letters from the city.  WET’s Qualifications and Awards below are presented in Section 4.8. \nThe vertical Shaft system would provide a complete treatment for municipal wastewater. Its flexible design could be adopted to treat different flow rates, waste loading, and effluent limits.  The Treatment Shaft replaces all components of a conventional treatment system in fewer structures.  The advantages of the Dual Treatment Shaft are:\nLower capital and operational cost by combining many components into fewer structures and less equipment property cost.\nFraction of the footprint than any conventional wastewater treatment system.\nMuch more reliable odor control because of its limited ambient air exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Comparative Analysis\nWhat follows, is a comparative study between the newly awarded traditional Wastewater Treatment Plant (Al Khansa in Baghdad) by the municipality of Baghdad, sewerage department and  the proposed Medical City/Al Zuyut Vertical Wastewater Treatment Plant.  This comparison will address the technical, cost and space requirements aspects of the two alternatives.  This comparison shows that the Vertical Treatment Shaft has a similar or higher level of treatment than conventional systems with much less cost, less  land use, and complete odor control.  \nTechnical Comparison\nThe following table compares the  traditional Wastewater Treatment Plant critical technical design criteria and the proposed innovative Medical City/Al Zuyut Wastewater Treatment Plant using Vertical Treatment Shaft.  As shown on the table,  there is a similarity between the two criteria, however the Vertical Treatment Shaft uses a different arrangement of the main treatment components and processes to be located  in fewer and deeper structures that will save on cost and uses a fraction of land needed. \nComponents\nVertical Treatment Shaft\nTraditional WWTP\n1.

Solid Handling Unit\nSludge dewatering and Thickener\nSludge dewatering and Thickener\nSolid Disposal\nOff Site\nOff Site\n\nCapacity \nThe Al Khansa Wastewater treatment plant was designed with a Capacity Of 200,000 ㎥/Day.  It is located at the end of the northeastern main sewage line  on the banks of the Diyala River within the Alfadhiliya area.  \nIn comparison, the Medical City proposed Wastewater Treatment Plant will be designed for 182,000 ㎥/Day for sanitary waste flow during dry weather condition and 900,000  ㎥/Day.  for combined flow (sanitary and storm) during wet weather conditions.  \n\n\nCost Comparison\nThe Al Khansa Wastewater Treatment Plant was designed for a treatment capacity of 200,000 ㎥/day.  The construction cost for this project was awarded for 223 million USD. To our understanding, this does not include the cost of feasibility study, design and operation.  This unit cost is equivalent to 1,115 USD/㎥/day of treated wastewater (223,000,000 / 200,000) \nOn the other hand, the Medical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Shaft treatment capacity of  182,000 ㎥/day total cost is 146,651,127 million USD inclusive of feasibility study, design, and operation management:   This unit cost is equivalent to 1,115 USD/㎥/day of treated wastewater (146,651,127/ 182,000) .\n\nLand Requirements\nThe Al Khansa Wastewater Treatment Plant is designed to be built on an area of  126,607 ㎡ (51 dunums). The area available for the Medical City Vertical Treatment Shaft treatment is a parcel of 100 m by 100 m (10,000 ㎡ or 4 dunums).  This is the only parcel of land that the municipality could acquire next to the Medical City Complex. This will preclude using any traditional WasteWater Treatment option that requires a much larger area.  The following provides a drawing showing the comparison of the footprint of the Vertical Treatment Shaft proposed to the Medical City project compared to traditional treatment represented by Al Khansa project and proposed location for the Medical City WWTP at the available land next to the Medical City complex.  \n\n\n\n\nFootprint and space allocated for the Al khansa (51 Dunums) and Medical City WWTPs (4 Dunums) (NEED TO PUT THE AREA OF OUR VERTICAL TREATMENT ON THE ABOVE PLOT FOR COMPARISON AND NOT ONLY ON ITS OWN\n\nMedical City WWTP Proposed Construction Site on a 4 Dunums Lot Next to the Medical City Complex in Baghdad\nOdor Control\nWhile improving the quality of the water, urban sewage plants have brought problems to its surrounding environment, the most typical of which is the problem of odor pollution. The Al Khansa WWTP uses oxidation ditches typical for conventional treatment plant design that emits unacceptable odors during operation especially next to the Medical City Complex in the center of the capital Baghdad and very close to the Tigris River that could be developed in the future to a park.  Al Khansa WWTP was designed to use conventional Aeration Chambers for treatment.  These chambers are open surface tanks that agitate the sewage water as it passes through it with rotating brushes.  This process produces a great amount of odors to the ambient air.  \n\n\nAl Khansa WWTP -Uses 24 Oxidation Ditches that cause source of odor.\nOdor control for the Medical  City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants will be provided by enclosing the headworks and sludge dewatering equipment in the headworks building.  Shaft 1 will also be covered.  Fresh air for these enclosed areas will be provided and form the input to the activated sludge aeration compressors.  This will result in the odors emanating from these enclosed portions of the plant to be deodorized by the mixed liquor. \nOdor is one of the negative impacts of any wastewater treatment facility and especially in congested areas like the Medical Center area.  Because of the compact nature of the Treatment Shaft and the facility is not spread out and limited to only a few structures, providing cover for the facility is an effective way of controlling odor emission.  Air ventilation from the space below the cover will reduce odor escaping outside.  Exhaust air will be directed to the air blower for the aeration chamber for treatment.   \n\nMedical City WWTP Uses Covers and Treat Odor in the Headspace Air (No Discharge to Ambient Atmosphere)\n\n4.8 Treatment Shaft Qualifications and Awards\n\nThe United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\nlisted the Treatment Shaft as an “Emerging Technology” in their Engineering Technology Manual\n\nThe Treatment Shaft was recognized as an innovative Emerging Technology in the “United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)’s Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management” Manual in 2013 document issued March, 2013. View online here on page 4-1 or see documentation below:\n\nThe \"United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management\" manual, published in 2013, explores cutting-edge innovations in wastewater treatment and management. This comprehensive document highlights emerging technologies aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes, particularly during periods of wet weather.\nThis includes award-winning technology involving a comprehensive process encompassing pre-treatment, primary and secondary treatment phases, and a final disinfection stage. Each phase is meticulously designed to efficiently reduce specific pollutants. By modeling the improvements in water markers for the Medical City site, we are confident that we can not only meet but also exceed the WHO and Iraqi legal standards for water discharge quality. Through the incorporation of advanced techniques and methodologies outlined in the EPA manual, we aim to address evolving challenges in wastewater management while promoting environmental sustainability and public health protection.\n\nUnited State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\n\nAward: EPA Performance and Innovation Creating Environmental Success\n\nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), the environmental regulatory agency in the State of Michigan, has nominated Dr. Ghalib for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for State Revolving Fund Creating Environmental Success (PISCES) Award” which was granted for the savings provided to the City.
