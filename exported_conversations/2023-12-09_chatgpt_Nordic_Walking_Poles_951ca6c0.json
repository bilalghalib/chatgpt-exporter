      "content": "The equipment you're describing sounds like Nordic walking poles. Nordic walking is an exercise activity that involves walking with poles similar to ski poles. It was originally a summer training regime for cross-country skiers. Using these poles helps engage the upper body muscles, including the abs, providing a more comprehensive workout than regular walking. This activity is known for its effectiveness in increasing cardiovascular workout intensity and for engaging more muscle groups than standard walking.",
