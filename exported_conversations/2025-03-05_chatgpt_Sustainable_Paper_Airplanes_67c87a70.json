      "content": "how can we update this activity to make it also about resource savings - something about cutting paper/no waste? need to make two planes from one sheet? I'm not 100% sure come up with a bunch of ideas that works well in facilitation and try:  [[[1 hour: Activity (you can find an alternate online activity on the drive)\n5 Minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work in groups to go through a rapid product development process.\nTell everyone they are a business developing a new product that will be sold to the training team: a paper airplane. The plane has to fly and look good. The price will reflect its design, functionality, and how efficiently it is produced. Based on the trainers' thoughts on your plane, they will give your plane a selling price.\nBreak the group into small teams (about 3 people per team).\nThe trainer should have prototyping materials ready, including paper, markers, stickers, etc. These items are available to the entrepreneurs to continue using as they want throughout the entire game. They can use whatever they want.\nEntrepreneurs are free to continue asking the trainers (the people buying the planes) questions about the activity/type of plane to design (they can do user research to find out more about how to design their plane based on customers' needs/wants).\nEntrepreneurs should feel free to work with their groups wherever they are comfortable.\n55 Minutes: Activity\n10 minutes: The team will have 10 minutes to design a new product (paper airplane). Encourage them to consider how to make an effective design while using materials efficiently.\n10 minutes: Each group will pitch their plane to the trainer.\nThe trainer will evaluate functionality, design, and the overall pitch to determine a price for each plane.\nThe trainer can also consider the amount of work that went into the plane design. Did the team create a design that maximized performance while minimizing wasted materials?\nThe trainer should set prices like $2, $5, $10, $15, $20 depending on detail and flying capabilities. Try to have a variety of prices.\nTell them that each plane costs $5 to make (make it all the same to keep it simple). When we price the plane, some people will get better margins or worse margins.\nAnd some people would be able to produce a lot or a little, causing different levels of profitability. Some designs might be more efficient, allowing for faster production or lower costs. It depends on how the game goes, but interesting conversations come up.\n15 Minutes: Scaling Up the Production\nAnnounce to the groups that you like all of the planes they pitched and you would like to purchase them for your store.\nThey will have 10 minutes to produce 15 of the planes they pitched.\nHalfway through this time (after about 7 minutes), announce a change in demand:\nYou are expecting high demand for these planes after a focus group, and you would like to order 25 planes instead.\nAnnounce that you will extend the delivery time by 5 additional minutes (13 minutes left for production).\n15 Minutes: Evaluation & Discussion\nBring everyone back and tell people production has stopped—they must now deliver their products.\nThe trainer will now pay each group for their product.\nCount each plane that matches the one they pitched. Reject planes that do not work or do not match what they pitched to you.\nMultiply the number of accepted planes by the price that was set before mass production.\nSubtract $5 for each plane they made (even if the plane was rejected because they produced it).\nCalculate who made the most money!\nTrainer Tip: Make it more fun by offering a small piece of candy for each $ of profit they made. (Some teams might realize that a more efficient process leads to higher profits!) Some people might owe you candy at the end if they weren’t profitable…. But don’t actually make them give you candy.\n\n[[Original Version]]\n5 minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work in groups to go through a rapid product development process.\nTell everyone they are a business developing a new product that will be sold to the training team: a paper airplane.

The plane must **fly well, look good, and be produced with minimal waste**. The price will reflect its design, functionality, and how efficiently it is produced. Waste reduction and creative use of materials will also impact the final pricing.\\n\\nBreak the group into small teams (about 3 people per team).\\n\\nThe trainer should have prototyping materials ready, including paper, markers, stickers, etc. However, each team is **only given one sheet of paper to start** and must make at least **two planes** from it. If they want more materials, they need to **justify their need for extra resources** (e.g., explaining why a second sheet will improve efficiency).\\n\\nTeams are encouraged to conduct user research by asking the trainers (buyers) about their needs and preferences before designing their planes.\\n\\nTeams should work wherever they are comfortable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 55 Minutes: Activity\\n**10 minutes: Product Design & Waste Reduction Challenge**  \\nEach team has 10 minutes to design a new product (paper airplane) while using materials **as efficiently as possible**. Encourage teams to experiment with:\\n- Making **two planes from one sheet** (e.g., modular folding, cutting without waste, etc.)\\n- Using scraps creatively for stabilizers, decorations, or new features.\\n- **Innovating ways to make production smoother and less resource-intensive**.\\n\\n**10 minutes: Pitching and Pricing**  \\nEach group pitches their plane(s) to the trainer. The trainer evaluates:\\n1. **Functionality** (Does it fly well?)\\n2. **Design appeal**\\n3. **Resource efficiency** (How much material was used/wasted?)\\n4. **Production feasibility** (Is it easy to scale?)\\n\\nThe trainer will set different selling prices based on the evaluation ($2, $5, $10, $15, $20). Additional points (or price increases) will be awarded for **smart material use and waste reduction**.\\n\\nTeams will be told that each **plane costs $5 to make**, regardless of material usage. However, they can earn **a $1 discount per plane if they significantly reduce material waste**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 15 Minutes: Scaling Up the Production\\nAnnounce that you like all the planes pitched and would like to purchase them for your store.\\n\\n- Teams will have **10 minutes to produce 15 planes** following their pitched design.\\n- Halfway through (after about 7 minutes), announce **a shift in demand**: Due to a focus group, you now want **25 planes instead**.\\n- Extend the production time by **5 additional minutes (total of 13 minutes left)**.\\n- Teams must decide how to **scale up efficiently without wasting materials**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 15 Minutes: Evaluation & Discussion\\n1. **Production ends** – all teams must deliver their products.\\n2. The trainer will evaluate each plane to ensure it matches the original design and flies well.\\n3. Multiply the number of **accepted** planes by the set price.\\n4. **Deduct $5 per plane** made but apply a **$1 discount per plane for sustainable production**.\\n5. **Calculate total profits** and see which team was the most profitable **while also being resource-efficient**.\\n6. **Trainer Tip:** To reinforce the lesson, use a **small token (e.g., candy) per dollar of profit** and highlight which teams saved materials effectively.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Reflection & Key Takeaways\\n- **What strategies helped teams reduce waste?**\\n- **Did sustainability impact profitability?**\\n- **How did demand shifts affect production choices?**\\n- **What real-world business lessons can be drawn from this exercise?**\\n\\nBy incorporating **resource efficiency** into the activity, participants not only learn about rapid product development but also **sustainable business practices and the economic impact of waste reduction**.\"}",
