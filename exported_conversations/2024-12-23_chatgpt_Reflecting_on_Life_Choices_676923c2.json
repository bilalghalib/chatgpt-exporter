I'm taking 15 milligrams of Adderall and my qualia from the Neurohacker Collective, just trying to stay positive and upbeat. And maybe it's the end of the year, maybe it's the fact that crypto is zipping and I never know when to sell, because I haven't figured out how to deal with taxes, and I don't really want to sell, and I don't really want to buy, I don't want to even look at it, and I don't really want to think about money, and I need to apply for a job, and I think I have a good prospect at the due school, but I don't want to ever get a job, because I'm not the kind of person that works for other people. I always have my own projects, and I work for myself, and it would be the first time, and I'd like you to sort of come up with 10 questions, work sort of like a mix between a coach and a psychoanalyst, and help me really reflect and think about my life, and the end of the year, it's December 23rd, 2024, and I'm feeling like the whole world is sort of falling apart, this war has kind of been going on, and I just feel a little bit uneasy in all sorts of ways, and I don't really have a job right now, or work, I have a little bit of money, but who even knows what money is, I don't know if I should be buying gold or silver, or what exactly, and I'm walking with my baby, and he's cute, and yesterday was my wife's birthday, and I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm having a hard time. Can you help me think through these things, and other things, you know, like I haven't really worked on my publication for my paper, and there's all these things that I just wish I was better at, but I'm not, and I'm getting old, and I don't really have time for working out, and my family's far away, and I don't know if I'm holding my application well, and my sheikh in Gambia, my teacher, spiritual master, has told me to always have a question of God, or a positive impression of God, and I'm struggling to do that. Can you tell me what to think, can you help me think through these things, go by questions, and try to help me understand, and find a better way forward?\", 'direction': 'in', 'decoding_id': None}",

I just finished a contract with the UN, they didn't really get me any new jobs, and I don't really like the fact that, you know, a lot of my self-worth and happiness comes from like, oh, I got a new job, yay, or like, oh, look at my bank account, it's got money in it, yay, but also I know that I have some obligations to my baby and my wife, and I want to be a good husband. Basically, I don't know, like, this happens quite regularly, I just feel low and down because I think I have a bit of a maybe depressive attitude or mindset, like it's been very common in my life that I just kind of feel low periodically, maybe even associated with the changing of the seasons and stuff like that, and this is not that uncommon, but I did find some mushrooms, which is nice, okay, I found a bunch of oysters, cool.\", 'direction': 'in', 'decoding_id': None}",

They're mostly just like grit your teeth and move forward and kind of, you know, understand that they'll change. But I feel like maybe my mind has just a negative orientation more than normal. It's I see it in my grandfather. I see it in my mom and like, you know, I try to get a little bit of an up boost feeling from my Adderall and from drinking a lot of tea or coffee, just trying to get this, you know, sense of positivity. And then when I have that, I can then have a pretty good day. But it just seems exogenous and I'm wondering if I should just go cold turkey. You know, I also have ADD and so I wonder if these things are related, you know, like ADD and people. I'm curious if you have any statistics and insights as to what happens when people with ADD hit their 40s, which is what's going to be happening with me next year and kind of what's the standard expected feelings and behaviors of wasted potential and all of that. Like I can imagine wasted potential and feeling like what am I doing in my life? And I just don't really understand how to manage my mind and I should be old enough. I should have figured this out by now and all that kind of stuff can be pretty standard. And if that's the standard, how can I be non-standard? What can I do that would be slightly different? And if I know what is supposed to happen because I'm just an average person just like everybody else and I can expect these things, what can I do or feel or say or think or start working on to respond differently to the same sort of conditions that someone with ADHD and potentially mild depression and a lot of potential and travel internationally and a lot of friends and live far away from his family and as parents age, I'm sure there's no doubt that's going to happen to you in this part of your life because parents age, you know what I mean? So what are the things that are standard happenings and what are some of the best responses that someone can do to prepare for and anticipate these things and just have a different response because I just don't want to be the average person who's surprised by the death of his parents or aging or sickness.

      "content": "{'content_type': 'audio_transcription', 'text': \"That sounds good, except I often use audio recording because I'm really good at talking and less good at sitting down and writing. I talk, and I write, and I actually produce a lot of text, but it just seems insurmountable and they go really wide, because I'm a really curious and diverse person. My interests just go really wide and become not very practical. It goes from, like, okay, here's how you can create a sustainable business that follows aesthetic principles and how this is a beautiful thing to do, and then at some point I'm talking about epistemology and ontology and the view of Muslims on the world and how we can redefine and reaccess this more psycho-mystical, open, unitarian, oneness perspective and how that will then influence how we start businesses. And it's just like, who's going to read and think and understand these things versus who's going to be able to just say, okay, so first step, have a good intention for your business. But it's like, I'd rather work on the deepest root causes rather than the end results of the fruits, and that makes it so that I get really broad and really, you know, I start talking about all sorts of things rather than, you know, some of the more immediate, at-hand practical stuff. And I wonder if, you know, like, when I write and I just have this stuff, I just look at it later and I'm like, okay, this is one book, this is two books, this is four books, this is how many different ideas are here. And so, you know, I don't have a problem with writing or producing content, I have a problem with, like, thinking about other people reading it and picking an audience and all of that stuff because I actually don't want to do that. Like, picking an audience and trying to come up with, like, a marketable book and this idea of, like, it's prepackaged, easy to digest something that just feels like it will be inauthentic. And then I realize that that's why I'm, like, poor and confusing and nobody understands me and no one knows how to hire me and I feel like I'm, like, rich with insight and ideas and I just do way too many different diverse things that are not adding up. And every time I try to even just do one thing that I can try to create and share, it becomes a huge, like, worldview that people have to get in and involved in and how can I bring these things together? You know, like, there's this guy, Baraka Blue, he has this Rumi-centered courses and he just does, like, reads Rumi and then asks people for their reflections and he holds space and people think of him as, you know, the poet guy who has these courses on mysticism and it's really clear. Like, if you want a course on Islamic mysticism and you're going to do it in a poetic way with a beautiful community, good aesthetics, all that, just go to, like, Baraka Blue and look at what he's doing. If you want, you know, Islamic economics and alternative views on how Muslims view economics, you can go to Ady Atiyah and take his courses, you know? And for me, it's like, I don't have a team, I don't have a PhD, I don't have consistency in anything that I've done. I've done robotics, I've done, you know, startup support and, you know, I'm now, like, working on this kind of worldview, mystic kind of interpretation that will define how we look at businesses to make them more sustainable, but that's not the goal. It's important not to have a goal, it's important to have a different way of seeing nature as a place where, you know, you can see the signs of God and then how does that change, you know, natural resources into things that you are much more respectful of and gentle with, including people, instead of human resources in a human resource department. What about, like, these people as people, as beautiful humans that you want to help them find their contribution? And that can be what a human resource department does, and I just think very broadly and diversely and confusingly, and it's also part of my journey, too, right? Like, I started very practically, I started with, like, open-source technology for good, you know, how can we use these tools that people are using to build rail and stuff to build good stuff? And then I had the idea of making my own showcase of these kinds of good things, and so I started my own projects, like the Awareness Project, when car bombs go off and it would crush a sculpture using an Arduino and send a tweet to people who promised to do good things whenever bad things happened, and it was to try to, you know, demonstrate how we can play with technology to be more positively responsive to the challenges of the world, to see the pain globally, but to act locally, and not to get overwhelmed with everything you can do, but to do something about one cause that you care about. And I have all these ideas, and I've built all these things, and I even thought to myself, like, oh, let's try to talk to ChatGPT differently and all this AI stuff and use our pen and paper and, like, write to them long form so that we can't copy and paste, so that we're more involved with our manual connection, and I made this app, and I just put it online at cursiveGPT.com, and nobody cares, because I don't market it, and I don't share it, and then how does that connect to anything else that I'm doing? And it's so messy, and, like, who the heck am I? What is this? Am I, like, a Renaissance man that nobody cares about, that when I die, people are like, oh, yeah, he had some interesting ideas, let's retrospectively write a book and honor this random person, but instead of, during my life, when I actually need work and a job and coherence and meaning and a story, like, what other characters in history were like this? You know, like, at least Benjamin Franklin, he had some jobs, you know, and, like, he made money, and I just, maybe this is connected to my whole, like, this taste with money thing, where I'm like, oh, yeah, you know, I don't really want money, dah, dah, dah, whatever, like, don't pay me too much, I just want to get it, like, accidentally in the side where someone actually sends it into my bank account where it's not connected to the stuff I do, and I'm not sure how I can possibly have a career thinking and behaving like that, but I think it's connected to my worldview, and until my worldview changes, I'm not sure I'll be able to fix that. Can you give, like, a breakdown, an analysis of how these things are all interconnected and maybe a path forward? Well, there you have it.\", 'direction': 'in', 'decoding_id': None}",

And I want it all to be also explainable, so that it's a part of our mind and our heart, rather than just our mind. And maybe we can reconnect to this idea of like, see, feel, do again. See the world, let it affect how you feel, and then what are you going to do about it. And you know, there's so much seeing of things with social media, and I really feel like there's a place for craft, and like connecting with quiet and solitude, and this place where things emerge. But I also would like you to kind of take a perspective from like a corporate leader's HR department, you know, like looking at a roster of different things to do. Like they can ask me like, okay, well, what's your track record? What's your impact? And all I can say is, I don't know, people like thank me after my workshops. And like, what's the point, right? Like, what's the point if it doesn't make businesses money, or make their teams more efficient, or any of these things? What if it just like makes people want to quit, you know? It's not going to be a great pitch for HR departments. And so I feel like there's a lot of issues with this, and I'm wondering if you could give me like a very strong critique from my greatest opponent in my work, and what they would say, so that I can think about a rebuttal, and actually maybe even change my mind, right? So help me change my mind, like look at it from a critique critic's perspective, look at it from a logical perspective, go through line by line, idea by idea, and just help me try to change my mind, even about one element, you know? Like maybe it is also about when people are young, they just need to do something, right? Something that is obviously good, rather than something abstractly good. And the obviously good thing could be like, okay, let's work on SDGs, and it's a cool project, and you know, changex.org, where you just do and copy, connect the dots, and you know, one of the things that I've never done is like work in a corporate environment, like I don't have that experience, I'm like, I can't even manage myself well, how am I going to be telling people about anything, if I don't have like the background and experience, like I'm almost 40, and I have no like giant success story, I built this business called bloom.pm, that it's not even making money, and I'm gonna just have it go away, because the funding in the Middle East has changed and stopping, like what am I supposed to say about my story that's exciting?

      "content": "Yeah, although I also have practical things, like how might we, I take inspiration from design thinking, I think about well-being, and very practical steps about how to do that. For instance, having check-ins, for instance, where we include deliberate rumination questions. And I want it all to be also explainable, so that it's a part of our mind and our heart, rather than just our mind. And maybe we can reconnect to this idea of like, see, feel, do again. See the world, let it affect how you feel, and then what are you going to do about it. And you know, there's so much seeing of things with social media, and I really feel like there's a place for craft, and like connecting with quiet and solitude, and this place where things emerge. But I also would like you to kind of take a perspective from like a corporate leader's HR department, you know, like looking at a roster of different things to do. Like they can ask me like, okay, well, what's your track record? What's your impact? And all I can say is, I don't know, people like thank me after my workshops. And like, what's the point, right? Like, what's the point if it doesn't make businesses money, or make their teams more efficient, or any of these things? What if it just like makes people want to quit, you know? It's not going to be a great pitch for HR departments. And so I feel like there's a lot of issues with this, and I'm wondering if you could give me like a very strong critique from my greatest opponent in my work, and what they would say, so that I can think about a rebuttal, and actually maybe even change my mind, right? So help me change my mind, like look at it from a critique critic's perspective, look at it from a logical perspective, go through line by line, idea by idea, and just help me try to change my mind, even about one element, you know? Like maybe it is also about when people are young, they just need to do something, right? Something that is obviously good, rather than something abstractly good. And the obviously good thing could be like, okay, let's work on SDGs, and it's a cool project, and you know, changex.org, where you just do and copy, connect the dots, and you know, one of the things that I've never done is like work in a corporate environment, like I don't have that experience, I'm like, I can't even manage myself well, how am I going to be telling people about anything, if I don't have like the background and experience, like I'm almost 40, and I have no like giant success story, I built this business called bloom.pm, that it's not even making money, and I'm gonna just have it go away, because the funding in the Middle East has changed and stopping, like what am I supposed to say about my story that's exciting? And so first, let's come up with the critique, and then let's come up with a response.",

      "content": "### **Critique from Your Greatest Opponent's Perspective**\n\n1. **Lack of Clear Metrics:**\n   - \"Your work lacks measurable impact. Without concrete metrics—like increased revenue, retention rates, or efficiency—it's difficult for HR departments to justify your approach. 'People thanked me' doesn’t hold up in a boardroom.\"\n\n2. **Abstract and Intangible Outcomes:**\n   - \"Your emphasis on well-being and rumination is too abstract for corporate environments. Businesses prioritize clear, actionable outcomes. If your workshops lead people to quit because they realize they don’t like their jobs, why would a company hire you?\"\n\n3. **Weak Track Record:**\n   - \"You don't have a history of working in corporate environments or a major success story to point to. How can you claim to understand corporate needs when you've never been in that context?\"\n\n4. **Overly Philosophical Approach:**\n   - \"The 'see, feel, do' framework and ideas about craft and solitude are inspiring, but they lack direct applicability in fast-paced environments. Businesses need immediate, scalable solutions, not reflective journeys.\"\n\n5. **Potentially Disruptive Outcomes:**\n   - \"If your methods lead to employees rethinking their lives, it could create disengagement rather than improved performance. How does this serve organizational goals?\"\n\n6. **Lack of Alignment with Business Goals:**\n   - \"Your work doesn’t align with traditional business metrics like productivity, profitability, or innovation. Without a clear business case, your workshops could be seen as a waste of resources.\"\n\n7. **Perception of Personal Inadequacy:**\n   - \"Your lack of self-confidence in managing yourself and your career trajectory could make it hard for others to trust your guidance. If Bloom struggled to make money, why should others invest in your ideas?\"\n\n---\n\n### **Response and Rebuttal**\n\n1. **On Metrics:**\n   - **Rebuttal:** \"Measuring well-being and engagement is possible, and the outcomes are directly linked to organizational success. Studies show that happier, more engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and less likely to leave. I can start tracking these metrics to provide evidence.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** Develop post-workshop surveys and follow-up assessments to measure shifts in engagement, collaboration, and creativity.\n\n2. **On Abstract Outcomes:**\n   - **Rebuttal:** \"Abstract outcomes often lead to profound, long-term impacts. Companies investing in mindfulness, resilience, and psychological safety have seen significant returns.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** Frame the workshops as a way to foster creativity and resilience, directly tied to business innovation and adaptability.\n\n3. **On Weak Track Record:**\n   - **Rebuttal:** \"While I haven’t worked in a corporate environment, I’ve facilitated impactful workshops for diverse audiences. The principles I teach are universal and applicable anywhere.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** Leverage testimonials, case studies, or partnerships with organizations that can validate your work.\n\n4. **On Philosophical Approach:**\n   - **Rebuttal:** \"The 'see, feel, do' framework aligns with design thinking principles already embraced by leading companies. It provides a structured way to approach problem-solving while staying grounded in empathy and action.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** Translate philosophical ideas into clear, practical steps for immediate application in team settings.\n\n5. **On Disruptive Outcomes:**\n   - **Rebuttal:** \"Encouraging employees to reflect doesn’t mean disengagement—it means alignment. Employees who feel connected to their values and the company’s mission perform better and are less likely to burn out.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** Emphasize how your workshops align personal values with organizational goals, fostering a sense of purpose.\n\n6. **On Alignment with Business Goals:**\n   - **Rebuttal:** \"Well-being drives results. For example, Google’s Project Aristotle found that psychological safety is the number one predictor of high-performing teams. My workshops directly enhance these soft skills.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** Link workshop outcomes to metrics like team performance, innovation rates, or retention, and include these in pitches.\n\n7. **On Perception of Personal Inadequacy:**\n   - **Rebuttal:** \"Leadership isn’t about perfection but about authenticity and growth. My experiences with Bloom and beyond have given me unique insights into navigating challenges.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** Reframe your narrative: Bloom was an experiment in innovation and resilience, proving your ability to adapt and persevere in changing contexts.\n\n---\n\n### **Shifting Your Perspective**\n\nYou mentioned the tension between abstractly good and obviously good actions. Perhaps there’s merit in balancing both:\n- **Start Small, Prove Impact:** Focus on delivering workshops tied to specific goals like SDG alignment or team-building. These 'obviously good' projects can be easier to pitch.\n- **Emerge from Solitude:** Your emphasis on craft and solitude is a valuable counterpoint to the noise of social media. Package this as a \"quiet leadership\" program for managers dealing with overwhelm.\n- **Focus on Corporate Familiarity:** Partner with someone who understands corporate structures to bridge the gap between your philosophy and their needs.\n\nWould shifting toward more tangible outcomes while retaining your core philosophy feel authentic to you? Let me know how you'd like to refine this further!",

      "content": "Absolutely, let’s address the critique from your perspective while demonstrating your growth and the steps you’ll take to address these points.\n\n---\n\n### **Response and Action Plan**\n\n#### 1. **On Metrics and Measurable Impact**\n   - **Your Growth:** \"I’ve realized the importance of aligning my work with measurable outcomes, not just for validation but to create a narrative that bridges personal transformation and organizational goals. My experience has taught me that qualitative impact—like the stories of personal growth from workshop participants—can and should be complemented by data.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** \"I will implement post-workshop surveys to measure changes in employee engagement, creativity, and team collaboration. I’ll follow up with organizations six months after sessions to quantify long-term outcomes.\"\n\n#### 2. **On Abstract and Intangible Outcomes**\n   - **Your Growth:** \"I’ve learned that organizations value clarity and immediate applicability. While my approach focuses on deeper, emergent insights, I can scaffold these ideas into actionable frameworks that are easy to implement.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** \"I will translate my 'see, feel, do' philosophy into a practical toolkit, combining it with check-ins and deliberate rumination exercises tied to organizational priorities like innovation and team cohesion.\"\n\n#### 3. **On Track Record**\n   - **Your Growth:** \"My work at Bloom has given me deep insights into resilience, innovation, and adaptability in volatile contexts. I recognize now that I need to showcase how these lessons are universally applicable, even in corporate environments.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** \"I’ll build case studies from Bloom and other projects, highlighting specific examples where my approach led to concrete outcomes like improved team collaboration or innovative solutions in challenging environments.\"\n\n#### 4. **On Philosophical Approach**\n   - **Your Growth:** \"I understand now that ideas like craft, solitude, and emergence can feel abstract to some audiences. But these practices are more relevant than ever in helping organizations manage burnout and foster creativity.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** \"I’ll design a 'quiet leadership' module tailored for managers, focusing on how deliberate reflection and solitude can enhance decision-making and prevent burnout. This module will integrate clear deliverables like stress-reduction practices and creative problem-solving tools.\"\n\n#### 5. **On Potentially Disruptive Outcomes**\n   - **Your Growth:** \"Reflection isn’t about disengagement—it’s about alignment. I’ve seen firsthand how connecting people to their values leads to renewed energy and commitment, both personally and professionally.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** \"I’ll explicitly frame my workshops as alignment tools that connect employees’ personal values with organizational goals, making teams not just more fulfilled but more effective.\"\n\n#### 6. **On Alignment with Business Goals**\n   - **Your Growth:** \"I’ve come to understand that well-being and organizational success aren’t competing goals—they’re deeply interconnected. By focusing on psychological safety and creative capacity, my work supports key business metrics.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** \"I’ll integrate business-focused metrics into my pitches, such as innovation rates, retention rates, and team productivity, showing how these are enhanced through my approach.\"\n\n#### 7. **On Perception of Personal Inadequacy**\n   - **Your Growth:** \"I’ve reflected deeply on my narrative. Bloom wasn’t a failure—it was an incubator of resilience and adaptability, teaching me how to navigate uncertainty. My value lies not in perfection but in authenticity and the lessons I’ve learned through experimentation.\"\n   - **Actionable Step:** \"I’ll reframe my story as one of continuous growth, positioning myself as someone who thrives in ambiguity and helps others do the same. I’ll also identify specific areas for personal improvement, like partnering with a mentor who has corporate experience to deepen my understanding of that space.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps to Solidify Your Position**\n- **Develop a New Portfolio:** Create a portfolio that clearly outlines your workshops, their methodologies, and measurable impacts.\n- **Pilot a Corporate Program:** Run a small-scale workshop with a corporate team, gather feedback, and refine the approach to better align with their needs.\n- **Network Strategically:** Partner with someone who has corporate experience to co-facilitate or consult on bridging your approach with corporate language and priorities.\n- **Revisit Bloom:** Use your experience at Bloom as a living case study, focusing on the skills and insights gained rather than the financial challenges.\n\n---\n\nBy addressing these critiques through actionable changes, you’ll not only strengthen your position but also align your values with practical, impactful results. How does this resonate with you? Would you like to focus on any particular point further?",

Here are ten questions designed to help you reflect deeply, challenge your assumptions, and arrive at a genuine internal shift—one that aligns with your values while addressing the critique meaningfully.\n\n---\n\n1. **What do you believe is the core value or essence of your work, and how could aligning with corporate needs actually amplify rather than dilute that essence?**\n   - Reflect on how your unique perspective can meet both your ideals and their practical concerns.\n\n2. **What would need to change for you to feel like you're *offering* something transformative to corporate environments, rather than *adapting* to their demands?**\n   - Consider what it means to bring your philosophy into a new context on your terms.\n\n3. **How might metrics and measurable outcomes not just validate your work but serve as tools for deepening your impact and improving your workshops?**\n   - Think about whether measurement could be reframed as part of your reflective, iterative process.\n\n4. **What is your reaction to the idea that people might not \"get\" your workshops if they’re too abstract? Is it your responsibility to make your ideas more accessible, or is the onus on others to stretch themselves?**\n   - Reflect on whether compromise is a form of connection or a betrayal of your vision.\n\n5. **What would it take for you to see “corporate needs” not as limiting, but as a creative challenge that could evolve your work into something even greater?**\n   - Explore the potential growth in engaging with an unfamiliar context.\n\n6. **When you consider your past workshops, what are the moments or outcomes you’re most proud of, and how might you communicate those in a way that resonates with skeptics?**\n   - Focus on the *stories* that demonstrate your impact, even if they don’t follow conventional metrics.\n\n7. **What part of the critique feels most threatening to you, and why? Is it a challenge to your values, your confidence, or something else?**\n   - Identify the emotional core of your resistance and unpack it.\n\n8. **If you imagined working with a corporate HR team, what specific problems might they face that your approach could uniquely solve?**\n   - Shift the question from “how do I fit?” to “what needs am I uniquely positioned to meet?”\n\n9. **What assumptions might you be making about corporate environments, and how could you test or challenge those assumptions?**\n   - Reflect on whether your critiques of corporate culture are fully accurate or need re-examining.\n\n10. **If you could co-create an entirely new framework for corporate engagement—one that feels authentic to you—what would it look like, and how would it blend both your ideals and their goals?**\n   - Imagine a blueprint that doesn’t compromise but instead reinvents the conversation.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to explore any of these questions together, or do they bring to mind initial responses you’d like to share?",

      "content": "Yeah, so, I have, like, two ideas first. The first idea is kind of related to this thought that I had that it's not that I am against quantification, but I'm against quantifying the wrong things, and, like, maybe I could have been gathering some interesting stories and insights from my work in the past to be able to, first of all, just, like, take more pride. You know, like, quantification is visualized memory. It's like memory crystal. And when you can see it, you can be like, oh, my God. Like, if I was able to say that I helped 500 people not give up doing the things that matter to them and help them align with their intentions to do good, to share the gifts that they have in the world, like, that could be really inspiring to me. But I can't even say that because I've been so obtuse and, like, oh, no, you know, I don't want to measure. But measuring the right things could be great. So maybe this is one way we can align on that. Two is I think we need, like, an immune system for AI or, like, an AI vaccine for resolving this unseen conflict that no one is really talking about between employees trying to use artificial intelligence to kind of get away with doing less work and improve their quality without their employers knowing and employers wanting to essentially at some point use AI to replace their employees and reduce the headcount on their businesses. And, like, this is an unspoken thing. And I think there's some, like, beautiful ways to use artificial intelligence. But we're not really talking about it. We're just, you know, in these two different silos. And maybe this is one way I can work with corporate clients to identify a workshop that I can do with them. And then the other thing is maybe I shouldn't be working with corporate clients at all. Like, maybe that's the wrong question. Maybe the question for me should be something like who really could benefit from my skills and my knowledge and my expertise and the gifts that I have in terms of these types of workshops and sessions and talks and maybe even tools. You know, like, I've been thinking about making a tool based on the frameworks that we've developed for artificial intelligence where when people start asking it questions to do work for them, it can say, hold up, let me ask you some questions to show you the beauty that you have to give, you know, to help you see your blind spots, to help you see your skills and what you should be doing right now and to help you align on that and to encourage you and to coach you and to help you write and then to help you structure your writing so that your outputs are wonderful instead of just doing the writing for you and having it be this kind of garbage. You know, like, one of the interesting things that I did with AI recently was I asked it to ask me a bunch of questions to get as much of the writing done by me as possible so that it could just, you know, take the writing, cut the sentences up and organize them and structure them in a way that is coherent and clear to address the challenge. And this way, the work can be something that you're proud of because you came up with it, you did it, you know. But it was leveraging the advantage of AI in terms of being able to stay focused and on track and to answer the right question and if you ever are stuck, it can help you identify your blind spots and how other people would answer this so that your work can have a qualitative improvement. And this is something cool to use AI for. Not whatever people are doing, like here, write me a five-paragraph essay on, you know, innovation in the workplace or something. And that's a workshop that I could give. But I think the question I'm going to mirror back to you is, like, based on all the stuff that you know, should I be trying to get corporate clients? Is that the place for me to define my career? Or should I be working more with startups and individual people and people in the Middle East and North Africa and, you know, like, are these the people that would really value and appreciate the knowledge and expertise that I have, you know, with all of the post-traumatic growth frameworks How do you use AI to help people feel proud of themselves in their work rather than ashamed? And is there, like, something different that I should be doing as well in terms of, like, my self-confidence and mindset? And, you know, like, people kind of also get what they expect to get. If I tell them, like, I don't know, just a little workshop, I'll do a little thing for you, it might be helpful, it might not be. And if I instead said, like, okay, no, we're going to come up with a memory crystal, a.k.a. a data visualization, because that's what it is, you know, it takes the memory of the quantitative and qualitative feedback that people are giving and turns it into something that you can hold and it's a gem. And, you know, like, I've always been kind of opposed in some sense to gamification because I always felt like it was, like, belittling and making small and, like, the menu and people are going to just work for the menu, like, trying to get as much coins as possible and that's the problem with capitalism. It's like, oh yeah, more coins, that means good, right? And it's easy to make that simple rather than to say every day you need to check in with yourself and to think what is more good, right? And this is an insight I had a long time ago from my talk, Good is Hard, where I was talking about Fritz Haber and the guy that invented nitrogen fixing and how he was so adamant and kind of insistent on death and the thing is, he invented a thing that fed the planet and we called it good and we gave him a Nobel Prize and then there's this guy, right? Like, he invented the lobotomy, but he did it because he loved and he cared for the patients that were in his care and Edgar Moniz, right? So Edgar was like, oh, these poor people, in the case of the most extreme, most difficult situations, this is the thing that we can do to keep them safe and keep the people around them safe and he also won the Nobel Prize and both of their outputs, one looked bad very soon, one looked good very soon and then they switched and now we have a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where nothing grows because of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and for a while, lobotomies were horrible and they killed so many people and hurt so many people and this idea of like having, so this is like maybe the core issue around the measurement idea, it's like, unless you regularly come back to it and you see what your heart is telling you, looking at this memory crystal and being in constant feedback and that's the thing, I think, it's also related to all of this decentralized autonomous organizations, right? You think you know what good is and you can set it up and have this map drawn out and the lines and the waypoints, which are measurements along the way of these various things and it does a good job, it grows businesses. But at the end of the day, we want to make sure that these businesses are good and I kind of believe in a million billionaires rather than a thousand billionaires, right? So what if we had a billion millionaires instead of a million billionaires or the opposite, right? We need more people to be wealthy and to be able to dream even within the context of these organizations I feel like we can have different ways of business and that maybe it's really by doing these things and just maybe finding the core principles that will be able to direct thousands of people and to train HR staff to do these things, we can have kind of a slow growth of these philosophies that are about being and about remembering and about having these stories to be able to tell about our past that would still inspire us, right? And there's these stories that we can tell that would help people sort of understand themselves and this is kind of like the idea of the long-form autobiography, right? I kind of had this problem where when I was younger I was like, okay, when you're living, you got to imagine that you're telling your life story so let's make sure that by the end when you die you are happy with the main character and that nobody is like reading the story and be like, no, wait, why would you do that? Be angry with the main character and the thing is, I felt like that was too much self-centered and so I feel like maybe it's not an autobiography and maybe it's more like the Gandhi, my experiments with truth, right? And maybe it could be like my experiments with beauty",

      "content": "Thank you for sharing all these ideas, reflections, and questions. Let’s approach this systematically to help clarify your direction, starting with some tailored follow-up questions that build on your reflections while challenging you to deepen your thinking and align with your true goals.\n\n---\n\n### **Questions to Deepen Reflection and Resolve**\n\n#### **1. Measurement and Memory Crystals**\n- **What are the *right things* to measure that would genuinely inspire you and align with your values?**\n- **How might capturing these metrics not just validate your work to others but also give you a sense of pride and direction in your own story?**\n- **What’s stopping you from starting now—reviewing past work and gathering those stories to form the memory crystal?**\n\n---\n\n#### **2. The Corporate vs. Human Impact Question**\n- **What excites you more: influencing corporate systems for incremental change or working directly with individuals or startups for transformative impact?**\n- **If you focus on corporations, how could you design workshops that plant seeds of beauty and transformation within a system you currently see as flawed?**\n- **What would a client look like that perfectly aligns with both your values and your desire for financial sustainability?**\n\n---\n\n#### **3. AI and Human Creativity**\n- **How does the idea of using AI to foster pride in work, rather than replace it, connect with your vision for beauty and storytelling in people's lives?**\n- **What frameworks or tools could you create that combine your deep understanding of post-traumatic growth with AI's capacity to scaffold creativity?**\n- **Could your proposed AI vaccine concept become an entry point to engage with corporations or a broader audience in a way that feels authentic?**\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Reclaiming Confidence and Ownership**\n- **What internal narrative keeps you from fully owning your past successes, such as Bloom or your workshops?**\n- **How can you reframe those stories in a way that acknowledges both the learning and the impact you’ve had?**\n- **If someone else had done what you’ve done—built Bloom, facilitated meaningful workshops, developed a vision for AI tools—how would you celebrate their achievements? Why is it harder to do the same for yourself?**\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Gamification, Alignment, and Goodness**\n- **How might you design “good gamification”—a system that rewards reflection, connection, and alignment with values rather than just productivity?**\n- **What does ‘goodness’ look like in the context of the organizations and people you want to serve? How would you help them see and feel that?**\n- **What does ‘goodness’ look like in your own story, and how do you align with it in practical ways each day?**\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Stories, Principles, and Long-Term Impact**\n- **What’s the core story you want your work to tell about the world, and how does it connect with your audience’s struggles and desires?**\n- **What principles guide your approach to beauty, alignment, and impact? How might these principles inform a scalable framework that could influence others?**\n- **What does your \"experiments with beauty\" narrative look like, and how might sharing it empower others to run their own experiments?**\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Audience Fit**\n- **Who has already valued and benefited from your work the most—corporate clients, individuals, startups, or another group?**\n- **Which audience do you feel most inspired to serve, and why? How would serving them contribute to the larger story you want to tell about the world?**\n- **How might you prototype working with different audiences—corporates, startups, individual creators—so you can gather data about where you have the greatest impact?**\n\n---\n\n#### **8. Vision Beyond Individual Impact**\n- **If you imagine training thousands of HR leaders, startups, or individuals, how would you ensure your philosophies grow slowly and sustainably within their systems?**\n- **What kind of legacy do you want your work to leave behind for the people and organizations it touches?**\n- **How might the principles of decentralized organizations and autonomy help you scale your approach in a way that feels authentic and impactful?**\n\n---\n\n#### **9. Your Relationship with Measurement**\n- **If you could design your ideal feedback loop—a mix of stories, metrics, and visuals—what would it look like, and how would it inspire both you and others?**\n- **How might regularly revisiting these \"memory crystals\" keep you aligned with your values while adapting to what the world needs?**\n- **What’s one small way you could start capturing these stories and metrics today?**\n\n---\n\n#### **10. Practical and Philosophical Alignment**\n- **How do you reconcile the desire to create change in flawed systems (e.g., corporate environments) with the feeling that you should work elsewhere?**\n- **How do you ensure that your ideas, while philosophical, are also actionable and tangible?**\n- **What’s one small, “obviously good” thing you can do today that will help you build confidence in your ability to have impact while staying true to your values?**\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\nTake one or two questions that resonate most deeply with you and start journaling or discussing them further. If you'd like, I can help you unpack your responses or refine the questions into specific action steps. Which of these questions feels most urgent to explore first?",

      "content": "### **Bilal’s Response to the Questions**\n\n#### **1. On Measurement and Memory Crystals**\nBilal realizes that resistance to measurement was not about numbers but about the fear of losing the soul of his work. He sees now that measuring *the right things*—such as stories of alignment, resilience, and personal growth—creates a \"memory crystal,\" a visualized narrative that honors his values while inspiring others.\n\n#### **2. On Audience Fit**\nHe reflects that his deepest impact has been on individuals, small teams, and communities in the Middle East and North Africa. These are the people who connect deeply with his post-traumatic growth frameworks, AI ideas for alignment, and the spiritual depth he brings. Corporate clients may not be his home, and that's okay.\n\n#### **3. On AI as a Tool for Pride**\nHe feels inspired to build tools and frameworks that use AI to help people rediscover their unique gifts and take pride in their work. This aligns deeply with his value of helping others uncover their beauty and blind spots.\n\n#### **4. On Reclaiming Confidence**\nBilal recognizes that his story, far from being a failure, is a testament to resilience, exploration, and learning. He reframes Bloom as an experimental lab for his ideas, where he learned what works, what doesn’t, and what lights him up.\n\n#### **5. On His Place in the World**\nHe sees himself not as a fit for traditional corporate work but as a bridge for people and organizations navigating complex challenges—whether they are startups, community groups, or small businesses. His home is where innovation meets human connection, and where his frameworks can serve as tools for growth, alignment, and resilience.\n\n---\n\n### **Advice: Where Bilal Could Thrive**\n\n1. **Audience and Market**\n   - Focus on **startups, community organizations, and innovative leaders in the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Michigan**. These audiences value depth, resilience, and new ways of thinking.\n   - Build relationships with **impact-driven organizations** (e.g., nonprofits, social enterprises) looking for unique frameworks for team alignment, well-being, and creativity.\n\n2. **Signature Offering**\n   - Design workshops and tools around **post-traumatic growth, AI alignment, and reflective creativity**. Offer these as packages, pairing them with frameworks like the \"memory crystal\" (quantitative and qualitative insights) and \"experiments with beauty\" (a values-driven narrative approach).\n\n3. **Financial Plan**\n   - Create **tiered offerings**: \n     - Free/low-cost digital tools or templates for individuals.\n     - Premium workshops and retreats for organizations.\n     - A long-term subscription model for teams to access ongoing coaching or data visualization dashboards.\n\n4. **Legacy Projects**\n   - Build a tool for **AI-assisted reflective alignment**—helping individuals take pride in their work by uncovering blind spots and enhancing their outputs.\n   - Write a book or create a documentary: **\"My Experiments with Beauty\"**, capturing your journey, philosophy, and the stories of transformation you’ve facilitated.\n\n---\n\n### **Landing Page Concept**\n\n**Title:**  \n*Awaken Alignment. Spark Resilience. Create Beauty.*\n\n**Introduction:**  \nBilal Ghalib designs transformative workshops and tools to help teams, startups, and individuals navigate complexity, align with their values, and take pride in their work.

      "content": "Below is a vision of a future you’ll *come alive* in—one that balances your yearning for deep transformation, your desire to see the divine light in others, and your practical need to earn a living and share your gifts at scale. It addresses:\n\n- **Where and with whom you could collaborate** (e.g., Spain, Learning Planet Institute, Pascal, co-founders)  \n- **How to refine your Barakanomics book** to make it accessible yet transformative  \n- **A career path** that solves real problems while letting you shine  \n\nFollowing that is a “pitch” you can use (with some tweaking) when you talk to potential partners, funders, or communities about what you offer. It focuses on the problem you solve, the frameworks or ideas that you bring, and how they provide real value.\n\n---\n\n## 1. A Possible Life-Giving Path\n\n1. **Decide on a Core “Product” Beyond Your Time**\n   - **Book on Barakanomics**: A structured but inviting journey into spiritual/regenerative economics.  \n   - **AI-Assisted Tool**: Helps people reflect on their gifts, fosters alignment, and organizes their thinking into coherent outputs (instead of AI doing the work *for* them).\n   - **Modular Workshops**: Short, impactful sessions (online or in-person) around post-traumatic growth, reflective AI usage, and “seeing the divine light” in everyday work.\n\n2. **Identify Collaborators and Locations That Energize You**\n   - **La Fonda in Spain**: If it offers a community of creatives and innovators, it could be the perfect “human-scale” environment where people appreciate depth, resilience, and mystical edges.  \n   - **Learning Planet Institute in Paris**: They focus on learning innovation, open science, and community-driven change. This might resonate deeply with your emphasis on reflection and well-being.  \n   - **Local Partners (e.g., Pascal or new co-founders)**: People who share your passion for blending spirituality, design thinking, and AI. It could be a small but agile team capable of turning your big ideas into structured offerings.\n\n3. **Design a Structured Yet Fluid Workflow**\n   - **Morning Creation**: Dedicate 2 hours each day to writing or prototyping (the Barakanomics book, AI tool, or workshop outlines).  \n   - **Community Afternoons**: Networking, calls, or co-working sessions with partners who can keep you accountable and expand your perspective.  \n   - **Regular Reflection**: Schedule weekly personal “memory crystal” reviews: gather small data points, stories, and aha moments from your workshops or user feedback. This keeps you motivated and in touch with your deeper why.\n\n4. **Refining the Barakanomics Book**\n   - **Anchor in Personal Stories**: Open each chapter with a real-life anecdote (from your own experiments or from others) that crystallizes a key concept.  \n   - **Offer Gentle Frameworks**: At the end of each chapter, include a short reflection or “experiment with beauty,” guiding readers to integrate ideas without rigid step-by-step instructions.  \n   - **Maintain Mystical Depth Without Overwhelm**: Pick 3–5 core principles (e.g., humility, generosity, balance, gratitude, alignment with the divine) and weave them throughout as recurring themes.  \n   - **Add Visual Elements**: Create simple “memory crystals” or data snapshots (e.g., graphs, doodles, mind maps) to show how these principles come to life in practice.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. What Problem Are You Solving?\n\n- **Problem**: In a hyper-competitive, AI-driven world, individuals and teams often feel disconnected from deeper meaning. Traditional approaches to productivity and “innovation” can lead to burnout or superficial results. Many are missing the spark of genuine alignment—where heart, mind, and spirit converge to create lasting value.\n\n- **Solution**: Your work provides a *pathway* (through workshops, tools, writing, and frameworks) that reconnects people to their own inner resources, fosters a sense of awe and purpose, and harnesses technology (like AI) to enhance rather than replace human creativity. You help them quantify (in ways that matter) the richness of their personal and collective growth—what you call “memory crystals.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Ideas & Frameworks You Offer\n\n1. **“See, Feel, Do”**  \n   A design-thinking-inspired approach that also taps into emotional and spiritual intelligence. It encourages people to:\n   - **See** what’s truly happening (beyond surface assumptions)  \n   - **Feel** what resonates in their hearts, forming authentic motivations  \n   - **Do** creative experiments that bring positive change\n\n2. **Post-Traumatic Growth & Reflective AI**  \n   - **PTG**: Techniques to transform adversity into resilience and deeper insight, especially relevant for teams facing uncertainty.  \n   - **AI Tools**: Reorient AI from a “replacement” mentality toward a “reflection” mentality—helping individuals see their strengths, articulate their ideas, and feel more ownership over the work.\n\n3. **Barakanomics**  \n   - A spiritual/regenerative economic framework emphasizing *baraka* (blessing, expansion, abundance rooted in alignment with the divine).  \n   - Encourages ethical decision-making, communal wealth, ecological awareness, and personal growth as key success metrics.\n\n4. **Memory Crystals**  \n   - A fresh spin on measurement: blending *numbers* and *stories* to preserve the essence of each milestone.  \n   - Visible proof that can spark gratitude, pride, and continued commitment.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Example “Pitch” (To Yourself and to Potential Partners)\n\n> **“Hi, I’m Bilal Ghalib. I help individuals and organizations discover a deeper sense of purpose and connection, especially in a rapidly changing, AI-driven world. Through workshops, reflective tools, and my Barakanomics framework, I guide people to ‘see, feel, and do’ in ways that spark true innovation and heart-centered growth.  \n>   \n> We use AI not to replace human creativity but to enhance it—helping participants form ‘memory crystals’ of their journey, both quantitative and qualitative, that keep them aligned with what truly matters. The result? Resilient teams, empowered individuals, and a new economic story that centers on ethical, regenerative practices.  \n>   \n> I’ve worked with diverse communities—post-traumatic growth workshops in Gaza, design thinking for marginalized groups, and AI reflection tools for creative teams—always with the same goal: help people come alive and create enduring impact. If you’re an organization or a community seeking this kind of alignment, I’d love to co-create with you.”**\n\n---\n\n## 5. A Plan for January to Launch This New Chapter\n\n### Jan 24\n- **Retrospective & Story Gathering**  \n  Spend a focused morning combing through old workshop notes, emails, participant feedback. Extract key “ah-ha” stories that illustrate how your approach impacted real people. Begin a *Memory Crystal Document*.\n\n### Jan 25\n- **Draft Barakanomics Chapter Sketches**  \n  Outline 3–5 core principles (e.g., humility, generosity, balance, gratitude, alignment). For each principle, choose a personal story and a real-world story from your retrospective.\n\n### Jan 26\n- **AI Tool Conceptualization**  \n  Sketch a wireframe or flowchart for how your reflective AI tool might prompt users to generate their own text. Start small. (If time: record a short Loom video explaining your concept.)\n\n### Jan 27\n- **Landing Page Update**  \n  Merge the new stories, your pitch, and “memory crystal” language onto a simple website or Notion page. Make it scannable, inviting, and anchored in the fresh stories you gathered.\n\n### Jan 28\n- **Co-Founder/Collab Outreach**  \n  Reach out to Pascal or potential collaborators to discuss your AI tool or workshop series. Also research La Fonda in Spain and Learning Planet Institute. Send short, compelling intro emails that reference your new pitch.\n\n### Jan 29\n- **Book Focus Day**  \n  Spend a block of hours fleshing out a single “Barakanomics” chapter. Incorporate at least one memory crystal from your retrospective. End the day with a quick read-through to see if it feels coherent and inspiring.\n\n### Jan 30\n- **AI Reflection Beta Testing**  \n  If feasible, test a rudimentary version of your AI reflection prompts with a few friends or past workshop participants. Gather feedback on clarity, engagement, and sense of ownership.\n\n### Jan 31\n- **Alignment & Future Vision**  \n  Host a private “alignment session” for yourself. Revisit your memory crystals, track how the week went, and finalize February’s plan. Decide if you’ll invest more time in seeking corporate leads, or double down on community-driven, mission-aligned groups.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Three Deep Questions to Inspire Revision\n\n1. **What part of you still resists “measuring” success, and how can you integrate that resistance to maintain authenticity while creating structures that sustain you?**  \n2. **Is there a place or group of people that consistently energizes you, and how can you intentionally spend more time with them to refine and test your ideas?**  \n3. **If you imagine an ideal day in 2025—where your book is out, your AI tool has a user base, and you’re earning sustainably—how do you feel in that scenario, and what small decisions right now move you closer to that feeling?**\n\n---\n\n### Final Note\nThis plan, pitch, and reflection aren’t about fitting yourself into someone else’s box—they’re about crystallizing (literally, in memory crystals!) what already makes you shine and taking the steps to share it with the world in a way that’s fulfilling, financially sustainable, and true to your vision of divine-inspired aliveness in people and their actions.",

I believe taking halal rizq(sustinance) seriously can be a source of our healing, and can bring balance to our world.\n\nThe phone in your pocket connects you with cobalt miners in Kolwezi, Congo, designers in San Francisco, USA, and oil refineries in Iraq. The money you spend on that phone is your vote for the hundreds of processes it takes to make, market, ship, and sell it to you. Are you ready to accept responsibility for your actions? Are you ready to face the miners in Congo? Are you willing to defend your vote before God (SWT)?\n\nAre we except from being considered accomplices to oppression that happens in the value chains of our products simply because we are unaware? \n\nIgnorance is an excuse until you know better, and in the light of the global wars, Occupy Wall Street, and the consequences of climate collapse, more people are waking up to the idea that many elements of our polycrisis are by products of the systems we use to get and spend our sustenance. There are movements, like the boycott, divest, and sanction (BDS) movement that have shown how we can follow our ethics in choosing what not to buy. This book will examine what to buy instead. \n\n“...I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves.”\n-Surah Ibrahim Ayah 22\n\nMuslims represent nearly a quarter of the population of the planet and we can show leadership by developing products and services that follow the beautiful advice of the Prophet of God (S) who has said in an authentic (sahih) hadith: \n\n“Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” \n- Sunan an-Nasa’i 5711; In-book reference : Book 51, Hadith 173\n\nIn an era of destabilizing change and disquiet, we all want our prayers to be answered, and the Prophet (S) has given us a clue as to the relationship between halal rizk and answered prayers:\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: O people, Allah is Good and He therefore, accepts only that which is good. …  He then made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair disheveled and covered with dust(a person desperately needy). He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication): \"O Lord, O Lord,\" whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful and his nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?\nSahih Muslim 1015\n\nIt has been said that true wealth is contentedness, a path towards contentedness in this life, and confidence on the day we will be held accountable to how we earned and spent our money is increasing our efforts to gain knowledge in what is كَسْبٍ طَيِّبٍ (pure earning) and how best to spend it..\n\nBy reading this book, the reader will:\nTake stock of their transactions and work to purify their regular expenditures\nLearn how to earn a halal livelihood and make business a part of our worship.\nBe inspired to establish Baraka-based businesses that can support a parallel economy, one where muslims can confidently acquire pure goods and services.\nBe a part of showing leadership to a world questioning capitalism without alternatives.\n\nAbout the Author\nBilal Ghalib is an educator, entrepreneur and facilitator with 15 years of experience training entrepreneurs internationally. \nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom.pm, a social impact entrepreneurship training organization and education technology company. He’s an advisor for Project Defy, a non-profit organization working to redefine education in India. And since 2015 he has been running the Nur Coop, a business that seeks to be a blessing to the entire value chain from dirt to delivery. \n\nI have X intentions for writing this book:\nTo open the blessings of God to our beloved Muslim Community by sharing knowledge on halal rizk(sustenance).\n To support more people to spend their money in ways that are regenerative and uplifting of the people and ecological systems that underlie their purchases.\nTo transform my own eyes, and others, and to see what happens to businesses which see their customers, the natural world, and their business with the eye of the heart. \nTo increase my taqwa of God(SWT) when he mentions in the Quran “O you who believe! Eat of the lawful and pure things that We have provided you.” [2:172]” that it is God(SWT) providing my sustenance. And I must seek the lawful and pure and increase my efforts in ensuring my consumption is within the good pleasure of God.\nTo inspire people by demonstrating that the Muslim economy can bring about a beautiful transformation. \nTo alter my perception of success and increase my contentedness.  \nTo share my intuition that Muslims can be a blessing for this world by their deeper concern on the next.\nTo invite Muslims, and myself, to decommodify the world and to return to a pre-modern way of seeing the signs of God in all things and all people. And to witness the accompanying change in my interactions, including commercial interactions, with all things. \n\n  The Market \nThe book has three target audiences:\nPrimary target: \nEarly-stage Muslim Entrepreneurs in the UK and the USA\nWhy is this book unique to them? Young Muslims are seeking security in an age of instability. The modern wisdom suggests they start multiple income streams, be their boss, and “ditch the 9-5” even if they could find one. The book attempts to direct them away from repeating the methods of doing business that have led to the age of instability in the first place and to seek trust not in themselves and their capabilities, to first put their relationship with God right, to purify their expenditures, and then to set an intention and execute on creating a taqwa-filled baraka based business that in aggregate can act as a lighthouse in an age of darkness. \nAffinity Groups:\n Cambridge Muslim College\n Karim Lahham\n Faithfully Sustainable\n4 Nations Unite\nGeoff Lawton and Greening The Desert Project\nPeople who like https://tuniqoasis.com/\n\nSecondary Target\nBusiness leaders with a heart.

It’s written as a text book and goes over broad subjects from HR to finance and accounting and setting up a business. My focus is towards inspiring producers and consumers to alter their purchase/production decisions by directing attention towards the problems people see with our ecology, our social ails and how we call to our lord wanting support when we know from the hadith: https://sunnah.com/nawawi40:10 - that unless we purify our clothes, our food, our drink - unless we purify the way we seek our sustenance that this hadith indicates our duaas are less likely to be answered, and God is capable of all things. My goal is not to describe a halal economics precisely, or to define where things are going wrong.\nMy goal is to activate people who become more and more careful and direct more and more of their economic power towards people who are more and more careful. Amplifying our strength and building the alternatives while ensuring our akhiras. \n\n  Book Marketing \nBelow is a breakdown of my team’s marketing assets and marketing plan for this book:\nMarketing Assets:\nWebsite: https://barakanomics.com X-Y unique visitors/month \nEmail List: 10,000 subscribers (Bloom.pm) 1,000 subscribers (Bilal Ghalib)\nFacebook: 12000 followers fans (Bloom.pm), 3800 followers (Bilal Ghalib)\nTwitter: 5974 followers (Bloom.pm), 3018 followers (Bilal Ghalib)\nYouTube: 727 Subscribers (Bilal Ghalib)\nInstagram: 4534 followers (Bloom.pm), 2806 followers (Bilal Ghalib)\nLinkedIn: 672 followers (Bloom.pm), 500 connections (Bilal Ghalib)\n\nMarketing Plan\nOur marketing plan will be divided into 3 phases:\nPre-Launch Phase (3-6 months before book launch)\nObjective of this phase: Build a real, engaged, and vibrant tribe of a like-minded community of \nreaders, evangelists, and action-takers who will be willing to pre-order, spread the word, and\nreview the book when it is released. \nWhat we’ll do:\nEarly engagement of readers through various online marketing campaigns that hint at the upcoming book, e.g., X, Y, Z.\nEarly engagement of Islamic and mainstream influencers who'd be interested in reading, reviewing, and promoting the book.\nBuild & launch book website + dedicated Facebook Group.\nRecord and promote book video trailer.\nGather book reviews / social proof / testimonials.\n\nLaunch Phase (first 3-6 weeks from book launch)\nObjective of this phase: Create an international buzz (online and offline) and sell the first\n3000-5000 copies during this period.\nWhat we’ll do:\nHold a virtual book launch party through high-quality streaming with special guests.\nOrganize book reading/signing events in X, Y and Z.\nPromote special “bulk order” offers – especially to corporate clients.\nOffer [insert supplementary product/item] as a bundle with the book at the book launch.\nRun exclusive launch contests.\nGet featured on traditional & media outlets via interviews, book reviews, & podcasts.\nEncourage readers to post reviews on Amazon.com to encourage friends and family to buy the book.\nEncourage Indie Islamic Bookstores to feature the new book and give their readers a special discount to our online course on [insert supplementary topic].\n\nPost-Launch Phase (After launch phase)\nObjective of this phase: Continuous promotion of the book via online workshops, webinars, and offline events and conferences.\nWhat we’ll do:\nAppear on relevant Islamic and mainstream conferences to promote the book.\nDevelop [insert name of online course], where I teach the content of the book to a live online audience and sell the book as an add on to the masterclass.\nWrite articles for Islamic and mainstream media, e.g., Muslim Matters, LinkedIn, Huffington Post, and Thrive Global.\n\n  The Manuscript \nManuscript Details\nAnticipated length: [Insert expected number of words]\nAnticipated completion date: Approximately 6-8 months after receiving a commitment from a publisher.\nSpecial Features: The manuscript will include various tables, charts, figures, and worksheet templates designed to graphically community important information in an easy-to-understand format.

All with deep adoration of beauty. What does God require of me, and why do I have these gifts and interests?\n \nMy High Himma Intention For Writing This Book\n \nHow will this high-himma intention impact the rest of my life?\nSPIRITUALLY\nInsha’allah my hope is to live the reality of what I’m writing more deeply, to begin to have\ntagwa even more thoroughly in my economic transactions and to be inspired to see that the \npromise of God is true for those who have taqwa.\nPHYSICALLY\nInsha’allah to actualize the intention of this book it will support my inspiration to stay physically\nstrong and capable of managing the tasks set forth for me\nMENTALLY\nMentally insha’allah I will be finding the dots connecting that I have been intuiting, that I find the intelligence to turn\nthe knowledge into food for thought that inspires others in a productive way to make changes in their lives and \ntransactions.\nSOCIALLY\nSociallly, insha’allah, I find my family closer and aligned with me in this work. That I find the others, that we form a global\nfamily of hope.\nFINANCIALLY\nFinancially insha’allah I hope this book activates a global engine of alternative economics of abundance for many, \nincluding my family, such that we do not need to compromise our values and deen in satisfying our needs. I hope to gain \nin confidence in my rizk, such that I fear not poverty, I find strength for generosity, and that God puts the Dunya in my \nhands to give from and not in my heart to keep.\nThe specific dua’a I’ll keep making for this book\nMay God align my thoughts and my actions and grant me accepted actions, may my efforts be inspired by his will, and may I continually be in service of the greatest Good, the Good that I cannot know through my nafs. May God(SWT) bless those who read these words, grant them an increase in faith and understanding on how to act upon it. May we together form a community which works in service of the Most Beautiful to bring beauty to this desperate world, and in doing so beautify our souls, and cause us to be gathered with the beautiful ones, the saints, the martyrs, and the Beautiful Prophet Mohammed (S). May this seed grow, and gather others who align with the intention, and spread to become a source of Nur(light) for those in the darkness of post-caplitalist anxiety and fear. May this be an antidote to the poison of greed, causing such ecological, war, and social destruction. May in finding a new intention to do business be the cause of filling our products and services with baraka, causing an unfolding of counterintuitive economics where all that participate in the market leave blessed, resourced, fed, and filled with meaning and purpose for their lives on earth and a vision of their akhira. May this be the start of a period of inner struggles against the nafs, rather than struggles to pay rent, avoid war and conflict, and the destructive forces of an ecosystem near collapse. May God support our teachers, and supporters, and inspire them to say what is needed and to cause us to hear and heed what is best and grant us the best of duaas that we couldn’t have originated on our own. Ya Allah, send your peace and prayers upon Mohammed and his family and his followers from now till the end of time, and cause me and this group to be among them, insha’allah ameen. \n\n \nMy Book’s Audience\nWho Am I Writing This Book For?\n\nmy audience is the person who is aware of the challenges that our economic activities have on the health of hte world yet aren’t aware that adhering to Islamic ethics in our financial matters is a part of the solution. I believe it can be a valuable resource for Muslims and non-Muslims who want to “positively protest” rather than BDS telling people what not to purchase to ensure a lack of complicity with evil. We want a purchase, encourage, Support PNS - movement telling people where to direct those efforts. and if those businesses don’t exist, I hope this book targets people who will be inspired to start them\n\n\nAge / Demographics / Interests\nAge: 25-45\nwomen/men - likely entrepreneurial, interested (mayyyyybe) in crypto, social impact, climate collapse, spirituality, rumi\nWhere Do My Readers “Hang Out”?\nPro palestinian protest movements?\nIslamic book stores in the UK \nEntrepreneurship ecosystem hubs GMW/Step Conf\n\n\nWho Do They Follow?\nProbably Cambridge Muslim College / Omar Faruq Abdullah\n\nMaybe Elon Musk/Read Gates Notes / Tim Ferriss / Andrew Huberman?\n\nZaytuna’s permaculture group - Rhamis Kent\n\nI’m not actually sure\nWhich Books Are They Interested In?

Amplifying our strength and building the alternatives while ensuring our akhiras. \n\n\n\nWhy Me?\n\nUnique Perspective\nI’ve been an entrepreneur since highshhool and have founded businesses and non-profits in the US, UK, and Lebanon.\n\nI’ve lived in San Francisco and was up-close and personal with the libertarian change the world through unfettered business. \n\nI’m a big nerd, programming, writing, reading, working as an educator and facilitator are big parts of my life, coaching and mentoring entrepreneurs internationally through my social impact accelerator project: Bloom.pm. \n\nI’ve been invited to participate in the Compassionate Leadership Summit with the Dalai Llama and am a part of impact fellowships and impact funder gatherings internationally, giving me a unique view at how wealth sees positive change. \n\nThis leads me to build and experiment with lots of different approaches. \nPersonal Experience & Transformation\nI think the quote that symbolizes this best this one:\n“Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.”\n― Rumi\n\nI was a part of the international impact making ecosystem being flown around to speak and pretend like we’re making a difference. \n\nOne day after leaving Syria and Iraq I came to America and had an emotional breakdown, I couldn’t stop crying for 3 days straight. I started to doubt my intentions when Al Jazeera was calling to interview me and I felt proud. Was I really making a difference or was I living the impact BS lifestyle?\n\nI wanted to be sincere, so I moved to Lebanon and started working in the camps there, and started a community home, and lived a financial experiment that went something like: “If someone else can make better use of the dollar I have I shouldn’t doubt them. If it wont literally kill me to give, then I should give” - and I lived that for a couple years … \n\nLots of changes since then, found a sheikh, started to realize my family has obligations that are more privledged than others, and started to attempt to reorder the world, including my financial world. \n\nMy work on the ground with grassroots financial experiments as well as my work in the social impact space working with funders to unlock a “superbloom” of positive change by funding and coaching social entrepreneurs in places most people over look gives me insights, doubts, and a desire to find another way. The way I’ve been exploring both on the grassroots and the systemic impact change methods need reformation and I believe the next step is to exit the mindset that causes me and others to play games within the system that itself is the problem. Something like that… \nExpertise & Credentials\nI’ve been working on a social impact accelerator https://bloom.pm since 2016\nI’ve run a grassroots innovation project gemsi.org from 2011-2020\nI’m a part of the INK Fellowship and the Compassionate Leadership Summit and the NEXUS Global initiatives. \n\n\nPassion & Commitment\nI’ve been digging away at the problem of systems and a more beautiful world since the Arab Spring in 2011 when I first came to the middle east to teach what I thought would help, technology and innovation. It changed to personal growth. And now I’m looking beyond the personal and attempting to identify the fact that the systems change strategy can be altered because there at least two components to the systems we attempt to operate within when people design strategies for systematic positive change.\nWe can ignore the thought that positive is a whole debate on its own for now. \n  \nThe systems we design have two interfaces - one with physical reality, the other with social reality. Social reality is more flexible and has been ignored because it’s the water us fish are swimming in. Indigenous people and indigenous knowledge are a view onto an alternative social reality, faith based perspectives often support an alternative view as well - “wealth isn’t decreased through chairty” - the challenge I and many others have is playing on a globalized field I find myself downplaying the “non-rational” views that emerge from my tradition. \n\nAs the world experiences fragmentation, politically and socially, and with the destruction of our life support systems in the natural world there is anger, fear, and I believe a possibility to open the door to new views of self and the cosmos that can offer a social reality that enables a new game to be played. In the years I’ve been working in “Development” what I’ve noticed is what Anand Giridharadas talks about in winners Take All, many good hearts working within systems, and unseen worldviews and a worship of money. What I believe is an internalized version of evolutionary theory which is applied to society, if it makes money it creates value, if it creates value, it shall survive. These unarticulated foundations underly the design of “development” strategies - focusing on social entrepreneurship for instance. While I encourage many paths forward, I am seeking to create space to discuss and perhaps find power within a new social reality - along with our physical reality which can open space for many new experiments.\n\nThe simple process of describing this is “indigenous economics” or “islamic gift economy” - etc - If what I’m sharing is interesting for you, or confusing, please reach out. I’m working to clarify my thoughts around this. I believe it’s my personal next step after bringing “personal development” alongside “professional development” in the social impact space through the https://bloom.pm accelerator programs we’ve been running. We have a funder looking to fund a MENA wide project come January and I’d like to propose something radically(from the roots of things) different. \n\nTime to cut the ribbon on a new playing field with new(old) rules.\n\n\n\nAudience Feedback\nI feel empowered to make at least one concrete change in my life to clarify, commit to and enact my values economically. \n\n\nClarity of Message\nIf you don’t like what you see in the world realize it’s a mirror of yourself. \n\nThese systems that create the impacts on the world are an aggregate of our human behavior \nظَهَرَ ٱلْفَسَادُ فِى ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِى ٱلنَّاسِ لِيُذِيقَهُم بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِى عَمِلُوا۟ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ ٤١\nCorruption has spread on land and sea as a result of what people’s hands have done, so that Allah may cause them to taste ˹the consequences of˺ some of their deeds and perhaps they might return ˹to the Right Path˺.\n\nAs muslims we’re a significant force on earth, 25% of the population and holders of about 10% of its wealth. \n\nMuslims are also more likely to be entrepreneurial. My question is what happens when 2% of all people on earth take their sustenance creation and sustenance expenditures as a form of worship? \n\nMy book doesn’t attempt to say we’ll fix all the problems, my book attempts to disown myself and others from those problems so when we die we can say we did our best.\n\n\n\nEmpathy & Understanding\nI’ve been an entrepreneur since 2003 and have started many things that haven’t worked, most things - in fact. \nWillingness to Be Vulnerable\nSharing my sincere doubts, pointing at the things that are working, opening space for the readers reflections and contributions.\nLong-Term Vision\nTo identify what the right thing to do today is. \nAnd to do that… for the long term.\n\n\n\n \nPotential Impact / Transformation\nMy Audience BEFORE Reading My Book\nThey might want to start a new business, or have a business. \nThey might be aware that economic protest is a part of an ethical engagement strategy They might be a part of the Boycot Divest Sanction (BDS) movement\nThey might have shopped at Wholefoods before and now feel weird about shopping there now that it was purchased by Amazon.\nThey might feel guilty about using Amazon, yet not be clear why, and use it anyway. \nThey might be interested in permaculture\n\n\nMy Audience AFTER Reading My Book\n\nMy hope is that by the end of the book, more people will be proud of what they eat, because their lives are more fully aligned with the will of God(SWT) and their sustinance (seeking it and consuming it) is now an act of worship, a vote for a more beautiful world, and an opening for their duaas to be answered. To increase their taqwa by having the dunya by a source of constant reminders, buy this/buy that - support this support that? Eat this/that? More moments of our days can be transformed into moments of concious choices towards that which is halal and tayyib and by doing so helps us become what Imran 3:10 says: كُنتُمۡ خَيۡرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخۡرِجَتۡ لِلنَّاسِ تَأۡمُرُونَ بِٱلۡمَعۡرُوفِ وَتَنۡهَوۡنَ عَنِ ٱلۡمُنكَرِ وَتُؤۡمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِۗ وَلَوۡ ءَامَنَ أَهۡلُ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ لَكَانَ خَيۡرٗا لَّهُمۚ مِّنۡهُمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُونَ وَأَكۡثَرُهُمُ ٱلۡفَٰسِقُونَ\nThe best of people, calling to good, and forbidding what is wrong - and we can do that with the way we simply live our days. \nLiving a day to the next requires resources, the way we aquire those and create those for others is one of the deepest ways we can call to good and forbid what is wrong. Systems only live by the blood flowing through their viens, our effort, our time and in a capitalist system, hence: our money is the blood that we must direct through and for alternative systems. My hope is that by the end of reading my book people will find small pockets of economic prostest (positive protest) and be convinced that more and more of how they spend their time/money can be purified. \n\n \n\nMy Book Pitch\nI’m writing a book on more dinar, less problems. \nThe transformative potential of a truly halal lifestyle.\nThe inclusion of the unseen in the science of economics\nI’m writing a book on the power of a dollar well spent… times a billion muslims seeking to do that. \nI’m writing a book on the honorable profession of being in business. \n\nI’m writing a book on how money can be the root of all goodness. \n\n\"Baraka by Design: Building Lives and Businesses Rooted in Blessings\"\nIntention: To provide a framework for entrepreneurs and consumers to align their actions with divine ethics.\n\"The True Cost of Cheap Socks: Connecting Consumption, Oppression, and the Sacred\"\nIntention: To open readers’ eyes to the moral and spiritual implications of their everyday economic choices.\n\nI’d like the book to be about a personal focus for the producers and the consumers to be careful with their income and earning it and how that taqwa(consciousness) will lead to the realization of abundance that might not look like it from the outside, even if the world remains broken, the idea of having contentedness - success is immediate when you are trusting and relying on God, success is a sense of rightness, uprightness, and there MAY be some outward impact(divesting from war machines, happier animals on farms, etc)  insha'allah there will be, we want to see less oppression, we care about people suffering in factories, animals being poisoned, our rivers being damaged, yet we bring it close to where success isn't a long way off, it's now. \nOnce we start taking care and realizing we are being taken care of when we take care of our money. it's better to be a little hungry and to be fed with the baraka of halal food that sustains farmers, cares for the earth, and is full of blessings in positive experiences through the entire value chain, that there is a timelessness - it's not a cause and effect it's not a theory of economics. it's the truth of the reality of success that you sense when you are generous when you donate to charity when you share the wealth your business creates and you see people flourishing, that sense - that's the sense of the divine presence and participation in a blessed economics…\n\n\n\n\n \nA Year From Now\nInsha’allah I untangle myself and and the million ideas to find the one worth sharing, the one that is a true contribution and beneficial knowledge that is useful and that it is alive in the world opening whatever doors are next. \n",

Overview\n\n> **بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم**  \n> **الحمد لله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام على رسوله الكريم**\n\n**Barakanomics: The Transformative Power of a Deeply Halal Economy** is a call to action for Muslims and non-Muslims alike to reconsider how we earn and spend our sustenance. Rooted in Islamic ethics and a profound sense of accountability to God (SWT), it argues that a *truly halal economy* can bring healing to individuals, communities, and the planet. Rather than simply critiquing the global capitalist system, this book aims to *activate* readers—entrepreneurs, consumers, and leaders—to direct their wealth, business practices, and consumption toward modes that uplift people and the environment, all while seeking divine pleasure and baraka (blessings).\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Halal Rizq and Accountability**: Understanding that our daily economic decisions—what we buy, sell, and invest in—are direct expressions of our ethics and belief in God.\n2. **Contentedness as True Wealth**: Realigning our perception of success with trust in God’s provision, rather than short-term gains or purely materialistic measures.\n3. **Practical Frameworks and Examples**: Guiding readers to transform ordinary purchases and business activities into acts of worship, positivity, and social impact.\n4. **Beyond BDS**: Proposing the next step—actively supporting businesses and projects that align with deeply ethical, regenerative principles, creating an ecosystem of goodness.\n\n**Barakanomics** is more than just a book; it is **also** the cornerstone of a broader career mission—an invitation to create, consult, and workshop with communities that aspire to a spiritually grounded, ethically robust approach to earning and spending. By linking the book’s message to workshops, AI tools, and new collaborations (such as at La Fonda in Spain or with the Learning Planet Institute in Paris), the author’s work in spiritual-ethical economics becomes a cohesive portfolio of offerings.\n\n---\n\n## II. About the Author\n\n**Bilal Ghalib** is an educator, entrepreneur, and facilitator with 15 years’ experience training entrepreneurs internationally. He co-founded **Bloom.pm**—a social impact entrepreneurship training organization and education technology company—and has advised grassroots innovations, such as the Nur Coop and Project Defy. Bilal’s passion for technology, personal growth, and social impact has brought him from San Francisco’s startup scene to refugee camps in Lebanon, and from corporate summits to **post-traumatic growth** workshops in conflict-affected areas.\n\nHis journey began with a desire to *change the world*, only to discover that sincerity in faith, alignment with divine ethics, and personal transformation are crucial to any real, lasting impact. Now, Bilal focuses on exploring how *halal rizq* (lawful sustenance), careful consumption, and an attitude of worship can provide answers to a system in crisis. With a background in social impact accelerators, grassroots campaigns, and an emerging AI-enabled approach to reflection, Bilal offers a **unique perspective** on how spiritual principles can drive real-world solutions.\n\n---\n\n## III. The Market\n\n### Primary Target\n**Early-Stage Muslim Entrepreneurs in the UK and the USA**  \n- Ages 25–45, actively exploring how to build ethically and spiritually informed businesses.  \n- Readers likely wrestling with modern entrepreneurial “hustle culture” but seeking a grounded, faith-based alternative.  \n- **Affinity Groups**: Cambridge Muslim College, Faithfully Sustainable, Greening the Desert Project, Tuniq Oasis, and other ecosystems connecting Islam, environment, and business.\n\n### Secondary Target\n**Business Leaders With Heart**  \n- Leaders who care about **social justice** and sustainability, including Indigenous, faith-based, or socially-conscious entrepreneurs.  \n- **Affinity Groups**: Charles Eisenstein’s *Sacred Economics*, Carol Sanford’s *The Regenerative Business*, and others forging new forms of socially responsible business.\n\n### Tertiary Target\n**Non-Muslim Conscious Consumers and Ethical Entrepreneurs**  \n- People interested in alternative economic models, ethical supply chains, and spiritual or philosophical underpinnings of commerce.  \n- **Affinity Groups**: Regenerative business communities, social enterprise networks, and those who read personal development or social critique books like *Atomic Habits*, *Nudge*, *Winners Take All*, etc.\n\n---\n\n## IV.

Still, the majority of young people are frightened of the future. The better things get, the worse we feel. The Western Enlightenment deified humanity. Now, everyone, everywhere, pressured by the need to survive in a globalized economy, is transformed from human beings into human resources. The planet devolves from signs of God into lifeless natural resources. It's time for Muslims to dethrone the religion of progress and return to a true Enlightenment, animated by an Islamic economics that aligns us with the true nature of things, pointing heavenward.”\"   Not quite manifesto-ey enough I guess… I think the issue is there are a few big questions and ideas I want to explore:\n1) The way modernity influences the way we know things. What is the self in the era of the selfie? What is death in the era of exponential thinking? Where is God when “everybody is waiting for the weekend”?\n2) Where did this perception of self and the world come from? Descartes? “The limits of our language define the limits of our world.”- Wittgenstein and we live in a world dominated by the English language, which developed and encoded much of the scientistic worldview from Darwin to Steven Pinker.\n3) What is the relationship between self-perception and identity and the way we wield power, including scientific power? Ex. Why didn’t the Ottoman khalifate or the Chinese Empire use their technology to initiate the “industrial revolution”?\n4) What alternative ways can we see the world and the self and the purpose of both?\n5) How would those alternative ways impact internal/external ecologies and the global economy?\n6) If those alternative worldviews, schemas, frameworks are available - what does it take to establish them and what are the consequences?\n7) Is it possible to answer these questions in one book?\n8) Is this one book, or 5?\n Curious if people are following my line of thinking and if there are any gaps. What do you think about the book/number of book ideas? Salam for now 🙂\n\n\n\neducation \nmy own personal progress\nrage against the machine\nthe machine is inside my head\n\n[Waterfall sounds] So, we want to discuss...\n\n[Waterfall sounds] We want to discuss... my book that I'm working on, which is... kind of hard to describe.\n\nIt's a book about... well, it's a book that's trying to do a few things.\n\nIt's trying to make explicit the connection between the sicknesses that we're getting as society.\n\nI mean, maybe that's a good way of talking about it, and, you know, a lot of medicine is... can be considered as... the removal of the causes of harm, rather than the... addition of a better solution.\n\nAnd in the world, there's a lot of effort and hope to build... a solution for climate collapse, which is an addition, right?\n\nYou can add particles that reflect in the upper atmosphere, and it will reduce the amount of solar radiation.\n\nAnd at the same time, we remember during COVID, when people were forced into lockdowns, that a lot of things were improving.\n\nNature is healing, they said.\n\nAnd similarly, in our world, we see so many of these problems happening, partially because of this idea of more is better, right?\n\nLike, you put the ingredients list, and you realize just how much stuff is filling our products.\n\nIt's kind of insane.\n\nYou see just preservatives, and it's because of this... of the solutions.\n\nThe solutions we make today are the problems we need to address of the future.\n\nYou know, like, how many new businesses sprung forth, because of this phone addiction, and all these businesses started trying to help people make time in their life, and screen time reduction, and...\n\nOne of the questions that I want to bring up and highlight in this book is, potentially, one of the reasons a lot of this challenge is happening is due to the...\n\n[Sounds of a vacuum cleaner] the lack of a clear vision of what life is about.\n\nThere's an issue when people designing our better futures want to prevent corruption by preventing the arena or the deployment of ethical action.\n\nAnd it reminds me of the problem with safety.\n\nAnd how we want our children to be safe, and we made their playgrounds incredibly boring.\n\nAnd I believe that we're doing this in all sorts of ways, but on a larger scale where, instead of increasing capacity and appropriate justification for someone to be proud about themselves and what they've committed their lives to and study and growth, being at the precipice of an ethical dilemma and doing the right thing, even though it was hard, and instead, what we get are...\n\n[Sounds of a vacuum cleaner] blockchain observability.\n\nAnd if that blockchain is a bad tool, it may have a useful purpose in making public protocols.\n\nI think that's one of the elements that's really quite important, that I don't think people really give it enough credit for, a protocol that can be publicly viewable and fairly interacted with, yet this idea of an AI governance system that will somehow see all the needs and the wants and make a perfectly efficient mechanism.\n\nPeople say markets work, right?\n\nBut what do they do?\n\nThey might work, but what are they working to do?\n\nFind the right price for what?\n\nAnd I think that's an interesting way of framing this whole problem.\n\nMarkets are super efficient, great ways of sharing information, because we leverage people's fear of death.\n\nThat's kind of what it is.\n\nMoney somehow is seen as this buffer against the inevitable, even if it's not.\n\nEvery rich person you know is dead at some point, died.\n\nAnd there's this group of people growing more and more.\n\nLoud, trying to increase our lifespan.\n\nAnd go to Mars.\n\nAnd it's as if our life on this planet is so... beautiful and so fleeting and so miraculous that we have to crush the butterfly in our hands to detect it.\n\nWe take this beautiful thing and, at some kind of perspective, the way the people are attempting to preserve and protect life on Earth is in the creation of these oppressive systems.\n\nOf this creation of this kind of techno-Soviet perspective where it's not this human life that's oppressive, but conscious.\n\nThis idea of progress and technology and growth and what people don't really see are the underlying principles.\n\nThe things that people are assuming about what human life is.\n\nSo the assumption is the thing that makes humanity special is consciousness.\n\nAnd that consciousness is not related at all to the human body and not related at all to life.\n\nIt's simply an artifact.\n\nIt's simply an artifact of the biological processes of an organism whose primary objective is reproduction.\n\nAnd through all of these accidents, we get to this special thing, right?\n\nAnd this special thing called consciousness is to be preserved at all costs.\n\nAnd you see this relates to the fundamental fear of death and this sense that we are our thoughts.\n\nAnd there are many people who see kind of a potential in this kind of perspective for affirmations.\n\nAnd as a man sinketh, there's nothing truly good or bad, but thinking makes it so, or whatever Shakespeare said.\n\nAnd that's an interesting perspective because I don't know if that's necessary too.\n\nAnd I believe that some of these like base underlying unquestioned theories about the world or about implications of these scientific theories.\n\nFor instance, survival of the fittest, I believe, is potentially one of these ways that libertarians kind of excuse themselves and nice use themselves, so libertarians kind of defend their thoughts.\n\nFree markets is a lot like the free \"world.\"\n\nThe free \"world\" ideas are going to be good or bad based on how they interact with the system.\n\nAnd it's expected similar to good genes that good ideas will be spread.\n\nAnd that's not necessarily true.\n\nThey're different.\n\nIt's the world of nature and the world of humanity.\n\nThere's more and more power coming into the hands of individuals.\n\nAnd so fewer ideas can be amplified.\n\nAnd then outrage and these qualitative realities of fear and a lack of trust and the idea of having the position to give at least a few fundamental base perspectives against which we must hold all of our other experiences.\n\nFor instance, you can think that God's mercy always is rest.\n\nThat is one of the principles or one of the foundational beliefs about God, about life, about the universe that we are told.\n\nAnd there's an unseen reality.\n\nAnd this unseen reality is existence.\n\nBecause we had no way of perceiving neutrinos, it didn't mean they didn't exist.\n\nJust because we had no way of measuring thoughts using EKGs and...\n\nIt doesn't mean that that wasn't happening.\n\nThere's people that are removing livers because livers were an important part of cognition.\n\nThe brain was useless and so it was thrown away.\n\nThe reality is it is extremely dark and your brain has no...\n\nYou are seeing your way.\n\nThis is the world filtered by your available sensory apparatus and there's the psychs-peaks-psychs-warth hypothesis that indicates that it's possible that our language makes up our world.\n\nLike, in science, my words are my world.\n\nAnd this means that our world is actually dark and what is light is this consciousness that is able to survive a type of reality, a flavor, a unique step person's reality.\n\nAnd so, in this lonely world, the question I have is what can be shared?\n\nSome of me sees that everything is sort of cause and effect.\n\nThere's a time delay and every time we see an event or hear a certain string of words it has an implication but not a causation.\n\nNot causation.\n\nWhen Abraham was being thrown into the fire, his yakin, his confidence in the power of God was so high that he didn't want the help of metaphysical entities in that moment because he was seeking his Lord.\n\nAnd this type of confidence that is possible has implications.\n\nAnd I believe that these implications show up in our world.\n\nSo, money isn't good.\n\nSuccess isn't good.\n\nGood is something that is known through a direct observation.\n\nGod is good and God can be known.\n\nYou know facts.\n\nYou infer theories.\n\nSo, do you know the theory of evolution?\n\nDo you know the fact of the Big Bang?\n\nWe've inferred these through our reason.\n\nThe reason is powerful.\n\nIt is able to tell us how to do many things.\n\nNow, because it is a mercy from God that the world operates meaningfully like a system.\n\nIt is a mercy that He also gave us the ability to identify good actions regardless of these systems.\n\nIt says that Satan makes you afraid of poverty.\n\nBut God encourages you to.\n\nWhat An says is that Satan threatens you with poverty.\n\nAnd so this idea that we feel this threat.\n\nBut do this anyway.\n\nAnd that when you do that, you will be given.\n\nYour money will have better cut in it when you donate some of it.\n\nYour time has better cut when you give some of it away.\n\nWe need to start to realize the truths that we can be seeking are spiritual truths that can be known through direct experience without interpretation or time.\n\nGod is good and His goodness is palpably felt in the moment of an act of generosity.\n\nWe see oppression towards people, towards animals, for those who are willing to look.\n\nAnd this is not the world, not the points of the world.\n\nThe point of the world is to attain satisfaction with the promise of God and a good ending.\n\nWith the refinement of ourselves.\n\nAnd not necessarily to protect and to stop deforestation or to end the war or to heal the sick or to reduce poverty.\n\nThese are realities that exist just like the reality of the Mount of Saffa not turning to gold in order to be a mercy for those pagans who had not yet converted.\n\nIf we get what we want, we become those we despise.\n\nIf we get into a state of reliance and to equate and to be a mean, our lives will be transformed.\n\nNow, does this mean that there will be no problems in the world?\n\nThat somehow we will become complacent and go up to a mountain somewhere and that's the end of the story somehow?\n\nOr does it mean that we will have heaven on earth?\n\nThat's also not the point.\n\nThose that are tried the most are those whom God loves the most.\n\nSo if that's the case and we know that the end of time will come with harsh trials and difficulties, then maybe if we're lucky, we can be one of those whom God loves.\n\nAnd those whom the Prophet ﷺ talks about in his hadith at the end of times, who do a little but are worth a lot.\n\nAnd I believe there's a secret in our history in looking at the tradespeople who came to Indonesia.\n\nAnd a whole population was inspired by the character and the qualities of the Muslims to become Muslim themselves.\n\nAnd Ava Ghazali says it's an obligation for anyone going into trade to understand the bare minimum requirements such that he or she is able to do it.\n\nAva Ghazali is able to properly conduct trade without committing haram or forbidden actions.\n\nAnd to tie all of this together is to try to suggest that with a billion and a half Muslims, the economic power of people having more taqwa, and wanting their prayers to be answered.\n\nAnd if we remember the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ, who saw this person who was dusty and disheveled and clearly in a state of need, and he was calling to God and he said about this man, \"How do you expect someone whose food is haram, his clothing is haram, and the way that he seeks his sustenance is forbidden?\n\nHow could God answer his call?\"\n\nAnd I feel that it is similar to that mountain of Safa where the Prophet refused to make the du'a'at to turn it into a mountain of gold because he wanted to open the pathways of mercy.\n\nAnd if we are given without effort, if we are given without becoming, without recognizing in the truth of the promises that God makes for us in the Qur'an, then we will not develop that confidence, that trust, not become those people who love God and whom God loves.\n\nAnd there is an important element here.\n\nThe book, I'm trying to write, wants to open these doors so that we can see the connections between the oil companies and the prophets that are being made and the governments that are in power and the disasters, the water violence in South America, the oil violence in the Middle East.\n\nAnd these are all things that are systemic.\n\nAnd you can sort of pull back the wool from your eyes and you can see this connection between the educational systems and the whole way the industrialized world appeared.\n\nI mean, one of the things that I really liked, I was watching The Lion of the Desert the other day and in the movie some of these rebels had taken some of the Italian fascist soldiers as prisoners and they were going to execute them on the spot.\n\nAnd this guy Omar Muhtar, the head of the rebel forces, was like, \"No, don't do that.\"\n\nBut they were like, \"Why?\n\nThey did it to us.\"\n\nAnd he just said, \"Well, they are not our teachers.\"\n\nAnd when we see how Adam Smith's worldview is infused during a colonial expansionist genocide practicing time and the industrial revolution was always historically seen by historians as so close to being done by the Chinese, so close to being done by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAnd the Ottoman Empire had developed technologies for the steam engine.\n\nThey could have very simply taken that technology and, you know, if they were ingenious enough to invent the steam engine and build those great mosques, I believe it's not a far-flung idea to imagine that they could have strung them up into factories on the Bosphorus spinning these turbines and, you know, they could have created factories full of children with nimble fingers making thimbles and teapots and who knows what else and conquering the world's trade.\n\nThey were right there, right between east and west.\n\nThey could have been great.\n\nAnd people keep saying, \"Why didn't they do it?\"\n\nThey were right there.\n\nThey had everything to do what made us so powerful.\n\nAnd I think it's interesting looking backward, but it's not as important as looking forward.\n\nSo looking backward we can say maybe they realized that they shouldn't.\n\nYou know, it's actually a clear connection because during the Ottoman time they wanted to import the printing press, but it was prevented because they had over thousands and thousands of scribes employed perfecting their craft.\n\nAnd these scribes would have been out of jobs and this craft would have been degraded and destroyed.\n\nAnd it's clear to see that with leadership there's the possibility for refusing the advancement of technology.\n\nWhen there's a different view of humanity from the enlightenment period onwards where we became our thoughts, where we became consciousness itself and only that and doubted everything else, we doubted our capacity for knowing what is good and what is bad.\n\nAnd who is human and who is not.\n\nAnd man is the measure of all things they say.\n\nAnd in the enlightenment times we lose the realization that if man is the measure of all things, it's only because man from the Muslim perspective has a connection to the divine.\n\nAnd the divine can be perceived before death, can be known, can be felt.\n\nThere's a qualitative nature to seeing a rainbow.\n\nThe poetics of holding your child's hand.\n\nThere's quantitative explanations of oxy, cotton and the hormones of the cartel hormones and the idea that in the dark, historically we were more likely to be bitten by snakes or stung by scorpions and therefore the dark is frightening and the sun implies good crops growing and warmth on our skin and lack of freezing to death.\n\nAnd therefore goodness is related to the foundational perception of man as a molecular machine with consciousness and seeking to reproduce.\n\nNow, you might not think that's how you see the world, but everything we are building in Western civilization builds with this perspective in mind.\n\nWhy do we struggle so much to extend quality life hours?\n\nWhy is death seen as a failure by doctors?\n\nThere are a few people on the edges, people that work with terminally ill patients, surprised that a psychedelic experience that breaks the capacity for communicating what has happened in rational terms gives people access to altered states of consciousness.\n\nThat they're surprised that this helps ease the pain of death.\n\nAnd we're just now opening up in Western society to realizing holy crap.\n\nThis is meaningful except it's only able to influence public discourse once it's moved into the lab and once people's stories are aggregated and categorized, and then, even then, the measures of whether or not we should be allowing these substances is related to the suffering that happens in life to decrease, not the success of a good death.\n\nIt's very stuck.\n\nWe are stuck in this world and we want to understand it.\n\nAnd in understanding it, we understand as people say, knowledge is power.\n\nAnd so if we can understand this world well enough, we may push back that which we fear and gain that which we want.\n\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, when we gain that which we want, we become those whom we despise.\n\nWhen we get that cake that you really wanted, you get fat.\n\nWhen you are a teenager and you just want all the attention from the ladies, you don't find your life partner.\n\nWhen all you want to do is travel, you wake up one day and you realize you have many acquaintances and no friends.\n\nWe need a way of living that tells us there's such thing as enough and that not only that, that there's qualitative things that are more important than the quantitative things.\n\nThere are the unseen things that matter.\n\nAnd I believe that this escalation of progress is sort of like a drug addict asking for just one more hit.\n\nIt is a promise that we are making each other in Western society that tomorrow will be better and the day after will be even better than that one.\n\nAnd if this doesn't seem to be true, then we will have to confront the reality that this life is what we have to live and is that good enough for me and for you.\n\nContentedness.\n\nCan we see this connection between and then we'll cure this disease and then that disease and then we'll have abundance that we'll find a way of sharing internationally, extending life spans.\n\nPeople are making all sorts of claims like Stephen Pinker's talking about how we're getting better on every measure that matters except the problem is the measures themselves.\n\nThe problem is they are measuring.\n\nThey are not measuring.\n\nThey are not coming to that moment of death.\n\nAnd I really think that we need to become friends with death and that having a society where death is hidden from us and birth is also sterilized and hidden from us makes it so that the opportunities for the big questions don't come up because people are rushing and they're given all these promises.\n\nWhy do you think Occupy Wall Street was so infuriating and energized and mobilized so many people around the world?\n\nIt's because this idea that play this game, this economic game and tomorrow will be better and the day after and without this constantly growing economy, without this idea that things will continually get better, we need, we will be afraid to stand still.\n\nIt's the craziest thing.\n\nYou know, when someone is so used to being busy that they are always creating situations that occupy them, they clean things, they do stuff, they pull things out from under the rug to seem busy because standing still is terrifying to contend with yourself and with the reality of what you think your life is.\n\nAnd this promise to its people because societies are fragile.\n\nThey are based on jointly held beliefs that are incongruent with how the world works.\n\nThe idea that we can just produce and continually produce is necessary for our average GDP expected lifestyle of our country.\n\nIf growth doesn't happen, it's seen as failure.\n\nAnd in a debt based economy, this growth kind of waggles up and down on top of production, which is basically taking knowledge plus the material world and turning it into material benefit for humans and exchanging value created for economic progress that gets represented in GDP.\n\nThis creates context for competition.\n\nThis creates context for continual growth in a world with finite resources and the necessary expansion of ways for people to spend their money on goods and services that has another cap, which is human attention.\n\nAnd so we've squeezed everything that we can from our attention, from our ability to convert resources into value and we're slowing down in terms of growth.\n\nAnd if there's no growth, then we must destroy because that is another avenue for expenditures.\n\nWe see the military as one of the largest budgets in most countries of the world.\n\nAnd it's not necessarily because we're concerned about conflict.\n\nIt's this economy of domination.\n\nThey're calling the tariffs that Trump is proposing economic warfare.\n\nAnd the worldview of others achieving technological progress first or growing wealthier and therefore more powerful and spending more on their military is scary.\n\nAnd these economic forces are driven by this need for constant growth because of the inability to accept death, this fear of the other and this thought of superiority by way of progress.\n\nOur ingenuity, creativity, production capacity.\n\nWe work hard and we do well by our innovation and our creativity.\n\nAnd we idealize these figures who are able to create wealth and a certain lifestyle for themselves.\n\nNow, these ideas create some of the setting for the world that we're in.\n\nAnd what I want to do with my book is to demonstrate that we can play the game that God designed us to play.\n\nAnd we can see that there's an alternative field overlaid on the one that you see now.\n\nThese same eyes will look differently at the same world and that impact will be visible in the arena where we interface with others.\n\nSome people have this idea of game B, that there's another game and they're going to join it.\n\nBut the interface of our games is economics.\n\nSo when there are people in the markets of Baghdad, what they used to do is they would put a chair outside.\n\nAnd that chair would stay there until they made the first sale of the day.\n\nAnd so the eyes that saw the economic mind of the salespeople of the shopkeepers were looking out at each other at the chairs.\n\nAnd if they've already made their first sale of the day, they wanted to be sure that their neighboring shops had that benefit as well.\n\nAnd so if the neighboring shop hasn't removed their chair yet and you know that they sell the product that a customer is asking for, they would direct them towards the other shop.\n\nThis idea of generosity and giving in the context of trade and sales and come to me first and marketing people's eyeballs out everywhere they look.\n\nSo they don't look at the other shopkeepers as influenced and informed by a world view that views materiality imbued with quality.\n\nAnd when I say quality, I mean that there's a reason for creation, that everyone has the world perfectly set up for them to live their next best values.\n\nThis isn't about changing the past.\n\nThis is about realizing this perfect setup for me to act and respond to all of the signs that are being presented at all times.\n\nIt's to look at another as your brother or sister.\n\nIt's to look at animals and to know that they are nations and tribes like us and that they are mothers and fathers and that they feel like the podium of the prophet made from this palm tree.\n\nAnd when the prophet left, the trees started crying.\n\nAnd we know from the prophet's stories and from stories of the saints there are ways to hear these things and you may belittle these stories.\n\nYou may realize though at some point what is in your head is darkness and silence.\n\nYou are not just an open channel to reality through your five senses.\n\nYou are a filter through your schemas, through your understanding.\n\nAnd understanding takes the form of stories that we're told that we learn in a process that is causative.\n\nX and so Y.\n\nA and so B.\n\nAnd these stories can be helpful.\n\nThey create the foundation of a lot of modern society.\n\nThe challenges acknowledging that the stories that have made modernity are based on a world imprisoned in itself.\n\nWith elements of competition and judgment of our peers and ourselves.\n\nStandards that we must provide value to be worthy of existence.\n\nWe grade our citizens on a scale that we use to grade our pre-packaged meats and screws so that we can assign them to tasks in an economic machine.\n\nAnd give them a story of the American dream that is failing them and the anger from multiple levels, from the level of American society realizing the falseness of these promises.\n\nAfter the economic collapse, after witnessing the growth of the space between the wealthy and the poor and the lack of growth of their own pay as productivity has grown due to technological advancements.\n\nAll of this and a debt-based, interest-based economic environment creates feedback loops that concentrate wealth alongside a belief that might make right and that knowledge leads to wealth and that hard work.\n\nAnd therefore, these people should be the people that we put in charge.\n\nWe are not taking into consideration the harm created in the production of the wealth, the accidents of time and history that led to this, nor the fact that in our economy, wealthy people are the ones that can create money.\n\nWe use the word \"money\" here to distinguish it from wealth.\n\nAnd my book aims to explore the themes of self-knowledge and alternative ways of life.\n\nNations or alternative economies that we can slowly turn to.\n\nThe self-knowledge is important because we need to begin to see where we got our ideas from and how our education has influenced what we think is real and is possible.\n\nAnd to create new experiments based on trusted sources that show us different paths that we can take that will be success every step of the way because you are living in line with the end in mind that you are able to perceive and connect to God with your intentions and to purify those intentions and to develop deeper trust and love and obedience, realizing that the more control you give up in the hands of God and the more you answer the call that God asks with the question of your birth, your peculiarities, your interests, your qualitative truths, the things that you might not even see about yourself because they are so much a part of you.\n\nAnd that the amount of money energy it takes to feed people.\"\"\"\nThen, first ask me 5 questions to help you build one overarching framework for the entire book and show how it weaves through each chapter and then come up with a framework for each chapter, then, and only when I say build it, take all the information and build the frameworks ",

      "content": "**Here are five targeted questions** to help clarify a single overarching framework and show how it might permeate each chapter:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Tension or “Dilemma”**\n\n> *What is the central tension you want readers to grapple with from start to finish—something that ties together modernity’s crises, Islamic/worldview insights, and the practical ways of living or “resisting the machine”?*\n\n- This tension could be, for instance, *“our pursuit of endless progress vs. our hunger for deeper meaning,”* or *“the collision between secular rationality and a theocentric worldview.”* Understanding this dilemma in one concise statement helps unify the book.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Primary Transformational Promise**\n\n> *When readers turn the final page, what single, cohesive transformation should they have undergone—intellectually, spiritually, or emotionally?*\n\n- Perhaps, *“They see a life beyond the illusions of progress and consumerism and embrace a God-centered, baraka-focused approach to daily living.”*\n\n---\n\n### **3. Structure of Inquiry vs. Instruction**\n\n> *Do you want each chapter to pose thought-provoking questions, share personal/collective stories, or offer direct “how-to” guidance—or a mix of all three?*  \n\n- Deciding whether you prefer a “journey of inquiry” tone (leading readers through questions) or an “instructional manifesto” tone (offering step-by-step changes) will shape the overarching framework’s rhythm.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Connecting Big-Picture Themes to Personal Application**\n\n> *How do you want to balance sweeping historical/philosophical critique (e.g., modernity, capitalism, scientific worldview) with personal spiritual practice and day-to-day decisions for the reader?*\n\n- In other words, do you envision each chapter moving from *“conceptual/historical”* to *“personal and practical,”* so that readers see exactly how your major themes shape their own routines, prayers, or economic choices?\n\n---\n\n### **5. Defining “Success” or “Resolution”**\n\n> *What does a redeemed or “healed” economic and spiritual life look like, both individually and communally, in the final vision you’re offering?*  \n\n- Clarifying this helps weave a consistent thread through every chapter’s conclusion, ensuring each stage of the book builds toward a shared image of alignment with God, nature, and others.\n\n---\n\n**Next Step**  \n- If you like, respond to these five questions. Then, once we have clarity, we can create:\n  1. **An overarching framework** (the book’s “spine”) that embodies your core tension, promise, and final vision.  \n  2. **A proposed structure or “map” for each chapter**—showing how this overarching framework unfolds progressively.  \n\nWhen you’re ready, we’ll **integrate all the context** (including the “brain dump,” your manifesto attempts, the Barakanomics proposals, etc.) to **“build it”** into a cohesive framework. Let me know when to move forward!",

      "content": "1. central tension is the tension between seeing problems and wanting to solve them immediately without detangling ourselves, realizing that the way we live is the problem, it's like mopping the floor while wearing muddy shoes inside. Slow down, shift from solving problems, fires everyhwere, to who am i what are my gifts what is needed what is my work as worship, my craft, what shall i give. rather than solving problems, this changes things from what can we use AI to automate and do for us into what should I be doing with my life and time. connects with contentment, solves consumption problems, changes orientation of life from taking to sharing, people like this are good coworkers, nice community members, builds societies we want to be a part of rather than a race to accrue wealth and solve climate change and problems so that we can... what exactly? the tension is that the more we've been working to make things better the more wealth inequality is growing, the more fear about the future is growing, the more we see our social systems atrophy, and fear of others growing, the more we see environmental destruction, it could be because we focus on this. imagine like it was during the pandemic where everyone started baking bread and focusing on their families the waters cleared up, things got better, imagine we did this only slightly more and not because of a pandemic, and because we reprioritized our lives and work and found more contentedment - would we need wars to move the economy forward? oversized goals to go to mars and save conciousness? merge with machines? imagine if people were happy with their lives and happy to die what does progress look like? Perhaps the illusion of progress can be considered the tension or dilemma? can you help me find the diamond here and share it in a clear way i often feel like i'm wordy yet i doing have punchy clear things to say\n2. perhaps at the final page i would like them to feel inspired to deepen into the practices they develop over the course of the book, the promises to go to prayer on time, or to have a muhasaba routine, or to be kinder to family because as the prophet said the best of you is the best to his family, and also to realize the best charity is to ones family and to find really tiny clear actionable things that will accrue over time like drops in a bucket to a worldview change. Maybe somehow like me when I read father greg boyles story it inspired me to do a drastic change and realize the importance of moving my body and work completely, not everyone is in a position to do this so both drastic and subtle changes are good. also if people start making different buying decisions, and if they're starting a business to have some frameworks for what are the foundations of what they need to do it well? Maybe that can be something in addition, like a workshop I run, what do you need to know before starting a business and making a business plan/business model canvas baraka edition, niyyah business start-up guide as a parallel workshop that I can run monthly? Or periodically, etc \n\ni'd like the book to have good questions and insights to take away from clear inspirational stories\nI think maybe having an inspirational story to practical advice with a framework at the end can be good.\n5. I think a humble sense of pride and gratitude for the opportunity to make a halal rizk (provision) along with a sense of care and carefulness. Knowing that we do what we can do, and look at what's between our hands, of course caring about global issues, yet let's do the work that transforms oruselves and every once in a while get on a zoom call that gathers the others or go to conferenes, etc. ",

      "content": "**Clarifying Your Core Tension and Desired Transformation**\n\nBased on your responses, here’s a distilled version of the “diamond” at the heart of your book:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Core Tension (The Diamond)**\nWe race to solve external crises (climate change, inequality, technological threats) but remain trapped in the very lifestyles and mindsets that create those crises in the first place. It’s like mopping the floor while wearing muddy boots—we keep creating more mess as we frantically attempt to clean up.\n\n### **Punchy Statement**\n> *“Our world is on fire because we refuse to take off our muddy boots. We obsess over fixing things ‘out there’ without transforming who we are and how we live.”*\n\n**Key Insight**  \nTrue progress begins when we slow down, realign our daily habits and spiritual priorities, and rediscover that life is about giving, worship, and craft—not about frantically ‘solving’ or endlessly accumulating.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Desired End State**\nBy the final page, readers feel:\n1. **Inspired** to deepen simple, actionable spiritual and relational practices—prayer, reflection (muhasabah), kindness to family, mindful consumption, etc.  \n2. **Equipped** with frameworks or “blueprints” for halal, baraka-centered living (including small businesses), recognizing that incremental changes compound like drops filling a bucket.  \n3. **At Peace** that genuine transformation begins inside each person (and each community), yet can still ripple outward to address global issues in more grounded, authentic ways.\n\n### **Punchy Statement**\n> *“A single shift in daily practice—praying on time, buying more ethically, or extending kindness—can become the seed of a more just, peaceful world. Real change grows from small acts of worship.”*\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Tone and Structure**\nYou want **inspirational stories** followed by **practical advice** with frameworks:\n- **Story** to evoke hope and possibility (like Father Greg Boyle’s impact on you).\n- **Reflection Questions** to help readers digest and apply the lesson.\n- **Actionable Framework** (e.g., the Baraka Business Canvas, a mindful muhasabah practice, or a routine for reorienting your day around prayer).\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Connecting Big Themes and Personal Steps**\n- Every chapter mixes “Why the world is on fire” (the big critique of modernity’s illusions of progress) with “How we can remove our muddy boots” (daily worship, family connections, mindful earning/spending).\n- Keep bridging **macro** (global crises, historical patterns) and **micro** (the choice to pray, to apologize, to share a meal, or to build a baraka-based business).\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Vision of a “Healed” Life**\nReaders leave with a **humble sense of pride and gratitude** in seeking halal provisions. They become:\n- Careful stewards of their local environment and relationships.\n- Confident that worship-infused work meets both worldly and spiritual needs.\n- Connected with a broader community of like-minded souls—sometimes online or at conferences—sharing knowledge and blessings.\n\n### **Punchy Statement**\n> *“Success isn’t found in conquering outer problems alone. It’s in purifying our own corners of life, trusting God’s provision, and building the world we long for—one careful step at a time.”*\n\n---\n\n### Next Step\nIf this captures the essence you’re aiming for, we can **move on to creating an overarching framework for each chapter**—one that consistently weaves these themes through stories, reflection, and practical tools. \n\nWhen you’re ready, just say the word, and I’ll **build** the full framework using all the details we’ve gathered.",

      "content": "Below is a **unified framework** for your book, complete with an **Introduction** (including a story and recent facts to logically prove the central dilemma) and **chapter-by-chapter outlines**. Each chapter weaves in the frameworks you’ve envisioned—such as muhasabah practices (self-reflection), baraka-based business models, mindful spending and earning, and practical spiritual routines.\n\n---\n\n# **OVERARCHING FRAMEWORK**\n\n### **The Core Metaphor**  \n- **Muddy Boots**: We’re trying to mop the floor (solve problems like inequality, climate collapse, and fear of the future) while our own boots stay muddy. Every step forward recreates mess.  \n- **Shift of Orientation**: Instead of rushing to “fix” external crises, we slow down and transform ourselves first—our daily actions, worldview, spiritual practices, and the way we do business.  \n\n### **Main Pillars**  \n1. **Awareness**: Seeing how the “mud” of consumerism, endless progress, and fear-based living tracks in new messes.  \n2. **Detangling & Reorienting**: Rediscovering worship, contentment, and human connection; using reflection (muhasabah) and spiritual frameworks to guide change.  \n3. **Intentional Action**: Channeling personal and communal practices (like mindful consumption, baraka-based enterprise, etc.) so that real solutions emerge from new ways of being.  \n4. **Ongoing Community**: Building supportive networks—online or face-to-face—where small changes compound into collective renewal.\n\n---\n\n# **INTRODUCTION: “Taking Off Our Muddy Boots”**\n\n## **1. Opening Story**  \nImagine the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic: planes were grounded, factories slowed, and for a brief moment, skies cleared above industrial centers. **Venice’s canals** became so clean that people claimed to see fish again. Social media overflowed with images of wildlife returning to places once dominated by humans. Meanwhile, millions found themselves baking bread, reconnecting with family, and reflecting on what truly mattered.\n\n- **Recent Fact**: In 2020, global CO2 emissions fell by nearly 7%—the largest decline on record. Yet, once lockdowns lifted, emissions bounced back, wealth inequality deepened, and fear of the future resurged.  \n- **Logic**: This reveals the central dilemma: If our supposed *solutions* merely pause the machinery without *changing how we live*, we revert right back to the same destructive patterns.\n\n## **2. The Dilemma, Plainly Stated**  \n- **We Try to Solve Problems While Creating New Ones**: Technological fixes to climate or inequality often amplify consumerism and centralize power, fueling the anxiety and “race” we were trying to alleviate.  \n- **Muddy Boots Analogy**: We’re tracking dirt onto every freshly mopped patch of floor. *More wealth, more technology, more convenience*—yet we see wars, ecological damage, emotional burnout, and intense competition.\n\n## **3. Thesis of the Book**  \nReal progress unfolds when we **shift from “urgent external fixes” to “inner and communal transformation.”** Our spiritual and everyday practices—prayer, kindness, mindful business building, ethical consumption—form the heart of a new, baraka-infused economy.  \n\n- **Proof**: The pandemic glimpse showed us that when we slow our pace, real clarity and healing can happen. So let’s be intentional about it—*without* waiting for global crises to force us again.\n\n## **4. Roadmap of the Chapters**  \n- You’ll see how each chapter addresses a dimension of this tension: from understanding the illusions of progress, to grounding daily practices, to shaping businesses that reflect new priorities, to building small communities of transformation.\n\n---\n\n# **CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER OUTLINE**\n\nBelow, each chapter follows a pattern:\n1. **Story or Real-Life Vignette** to ground the idea in human experience.  \n2. **Core Insight or Framework** to connect big concepts (modern illusions, spiritual truths) with daily life.  \n3. **Reflection/Action** tools—questions, baraka-based business canvas, muhasabah exercises—help readers apply the principles immediately.\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 1: The Illusion of Progress**\n\n- **Opening Story**: A short historical anecdote about a well-intentioned tech solution that backfired (e.g., “Green Revolution” agriculture increasing pesticide use and harming biodiversity).  \n- **Core Insight**: We often define *progress* purely in material terms (GDP, consumption, technology) while ignoring spiritual, communal, and ecological well-being.  \n- **Framework**: **“See-Feel-Do”**: \n  - **See** the illusions (statistics on wealth inequality, environmental damage).  \n  - **Feel** the discontent and moral urgency.  \n  - **Do** an internal check: *Where am I complicit?*  \n- **Reflection/Action**: Simple muhasabah prompt: “How have I personally chased illusions of progress at the expense of deeper well-being?”\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 2: Muddy Boots—Understanding Our Own Footprints**\n\n- **Opening Story**: A personal anecdote of someone trying to reduce plastic waste but still ordering cheap goods online—*contradiction in daily life.*  \n- **Core Insight**: External solutions fail when we don’t cleanse our own “mud.” Attitudes of convenience, fear, or vanity sabotage truly holistic change.  \n- **Framework**: **“Muhasabah Footprint”**—Track how your daily choices align (or not) with your stated values.  \n- **Reflection/Action**: Journal your daily spending or time usage. Identify at least one small “muddy” habit you can transform (e.g., skipping a daily coffee pod, rethinking fast fashion).\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 3: Worship as Work—Flipping the Narrative**\n\n- **Opening Story**: Father Greg Boyle’s example (or a parallel story) showing how deeply aligning “work” with “calling” transforms lives.  \n- **Core Insight**: Instead of seeing “problems to fix,” see “sacred roles to inhabit.” Work becomes worship (ibadah) when done with sincerity, humility, and service.  \n- **Framework**: **Niyyah (Intention) Filter**—In every project, business, or job, ask: \n  1. *Why am I doing this?*  \n  2. *Who benefits (or is harmed)?*  \n  3. *How can I embed worshipful sincerity in each task?*  \n- **Reflection/Action**: “Rewrite your job description” to highlight service, worship, and well-being. If unemployed or entrepreneurial, create an “intention statement” for your next role or project.\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 4: Slowing Down to Speed Up—The Pandemic Glimpse**\n\n- **Opening Story**: Revisiting the pandemic’s forced slowdown—clean skies, newfound bread-baking, more family time.  \n- **Core Insight**: Less frantic busy-ness opens space for creative, meaningful living and practical solutions. *We can integrate this slowdown intentionally.*  \n- **Framework**: **“Daily Stillness”** Routine—a 10-minute quiet reflection (or prayer) that fosters gratitude and realigns your day’s tasks with worship.  \n- **Reflection/Action**: Commit to a 7-day “Stillness Challenge.” Note changes in mood, decisions, and sense of clarity.\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 5: Sharing vs. Accumulating—From Taking to Giving**\n\n- **Opening Story**: A community that overcame crisis by sharing resources (e.g., a local mosque or neighborhood initiative).  \n- **Core Insight**: True wealth emerges through generosity, not hoarding. *Zakat and sadaqah* (charitable giving) are spiritual disruptions to greed.  \n- **Framework**: **Baraka Economy Principles**: \n  1. **Generosity**: Put at least one “giver’s budget line” in your monthly finances.  \n  2. **Trust**: Rely on God’s promise that giving won’t impoverish you.  \n  3. **Reciprocity**: Seek ways to exchange blessings, not just goods.  \n- **Reflection/Action**: Implement a micro-practice: e.g., “10% of my revenue/time is dedicated to direct generosity each month.” Track how it feels and what doors open.\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 6: Building a Baraka Business—Craft, Care, and Contentment**\n\n- **Opening Story**: An entrepreneur who started a small halal, eco-friendly venture with minimal resources but a big sense of care and sincerity.  \n- **Core Insight**: It’s possible to start or run a business that reflects Islamic ethics, fosters community well-being, and brings contentment—rather than endless hustle.  \n- **Framework**: **“Baraka Business Canvas”** (adapted from traditional Business Model Canvas, but includes:  \n  1. **Niyyah (Intention)**  \n  2. **Benefit to Creation** (social, ecological, spiritual)  \n  3. **Halal Value Chain**  \n  4. **Sadaqah & Zakat Integration**  \n  5. **Sustainability & Fairness**  \n- **Reflection/Action**: Outline a “Baraka Business” plan for a real or hypothetical venture. Include a “muhasabah checkpoint” at each step.  \n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 7: Community, Conferences, and Connection**\n\n- **Opening Story**: A personal account (maybe your own) of finding unexpected synergy in a group—like an online community or a small local meetup—where mutual encouragement led to real growth.  \n- **Core Insight**: We need each other to stay motivated and authentic. “Lone idealists” burn out quickly.  \n- **Framework**: **“Memory Crystals”** or “Community Scoreboards”—ways of measuring the intangible impacts of personal and group efforts (stories of alignment, transformations, shared prayers).  \n- **Reflection/Action**: Join or create a monthly Zoom circle or real-life meetup—share progress, keep each other accountable for living more mindfully.  \n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 8: Toward a Renewed Sense of Progress—‘Muddy Boots’ No More**\n\n- **Opening Story**: Bookend a hopeful tale—maybe someone who once chased external success but found deeper fulfillment by adopting the practices in this book.  \n- **Core Insight**: Our definition of “progress” evolves when we see the world through worship, humility, local focus, and generosity. The muddy boots can come off, step by step, as we become less enamored with big illusions and more in love with daily, God-centered living.  \n- **Framework**: **Final Muhasabah**—A short checklist for integrating the entire journey:  \n  1. **Revisit your daily worship**—is it rushed or intentional?  \n  2. **Assess your “footprint”**—are you still tracking in mud?  \n  3. **Refine your creative or business pursuits**—how do they serve the community?  \n  4. **Involve your family and networks**—who can help you sustain this path?  \n- **Reflection/Action**: Write a personal “Covenant” or “Manifesto” describing your next year’s commitment—spiritual, economic, relational.\n\n---\n\n# **Threading the Frameworks Throughout**\n\n1. **Muddy Boots**: Repeats as an analogy for personal entanglement in the very systems we aim to fix.  \n2. **Muhasabah (Reflection)**: Every chapter ends with an invitation to reflect—on spending, business practices, prayer, or intention.  \n3. **Niyyah (Intention) & Baraka**: Woven into each discussion on how to reclaim work as worship, giving as success, contentment as wealth.  \n4. **Daily Stillness & Community Check-ins**: Practical methods to ensure changes stick—quiet reflection and supportive group accountability.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: “Walking Forward Barefoot (or in Clean Shoes)”**\n\n- Briefly revisit the tension—**we once tried to fix the world while wearing muddy boots**—and celebrate the possibility that by changing ourselves (our worship, consumption, generosity, business models), we become **part of the solution**.  \n- Offer final encouragement: “This book is only the start—may your steps onward be guided by sincerity, humility, and the unwavering hope that God provides the best outcomes.”\n\n---\n\n### **Final Note**  \nThis structure shows **how** your central argument is proven through facts and anecdotes (intro), then applied chapter by chapter with **stories, frameworks, and reflection exercises**. It keeps the tension in focus and provides readers tangible ways to make small (or large) shifts in daily life—ultimately presenting a spiritual economy built on worship, contentment, and care rather than endless hustle and “progress.”",

      "content": "Below is a hypothetical **Karim Lahham–inspired** take on how the book’s introduction, titles, and flow might be adjusted, along with the **critiques** he might raise and the ways you could **integrate** those critiques into your manuscript.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Karim Lahham’s Perspective & Critiques**\n\nKarim Lahham is known for blending **classical Islamic scholarship** with a **philosophical, big-picture** perspective. He might:\n\n1. **Emphasize Metaphysical Foundations**  \n   - Critique: “Before launching into socio-economic problems, the text should clarify God’s centrality and the nature of the soul, so readers grasp the deeper stakes. Otherwise, we risk sounding merely like a moral or environmental movement with an ‘Islamic veneer.’”  \n   - Integration: Frame the introduction with Qur’anic foundations about *fitrah* (the natural disposition toward God) and how forgetting this divine alignment underlies our frantic, muddy-boot behavior.\n\n2. **Highlight the Concept of *Tawakkul* (Reliance on God) in Societal Context**  \n   - Critique: “It’s good to address personal muhasabah, but unless we weave the idea of *tawakkul* into the overarching narrative, we won’t adequately challenge the secular illusions of autonomy that drive modern ‘solutions.’”  \n   - Integration: Add sections explaining how real reliance on God reorients both individual behavior and collective policy or business norms.\n\n3. **Call for Clearer Philosophical Underpinnings**  \n   - Critique: “We mention illusions of progress but need to explicitly demonstrate the philosophical worldview shaping secular modernity and contrast it with an Islamic epistemology (e.g., knowledge as service to God and creation).”  \n   - Integration: In the introduction and early chapters, articulate how different assumptions about humanity’s purpose (material progress vs. spiritual fulfillment) lead to radically different outcomes—and highlight where the Enlightenment’s reason-based approach diverges from an Islamic, God-centered perspective.\n\n4. **Insist on Precise Language and Depth**  \n   - Critique: “The chapter titles and flow could use more scholarly gravitas, so it’s clear this isn’t mere self-help. Reflect in your language the depth of classical scholarship and the tradition you’re building upon.”  \n   - Integration: Adjust titles to reflect Sufi, theological, or ethical terms (e.g., *Futuwwa*, *Ihsan*, *Tazkiyah*), connecting them to real-life application. Include short references to classical thinkers (e.g., Al-Ghazālī, Ibn Taymiyyah, or Ibn ʿĀshūr) or contemporary scholars to ground each theme.\n\n5. **Encourage Inclusion of Historical Anecdotes**  \n   - Critique: “Use examples from Islamic history (e.g., Ottoman, early Muslim trade ethics) to contrast how societies once prioritized moral duty over exponential growth. It will ground the book in proven practices rather than hypothetical future scenarios alone.”  \n   - Integration: Insert historical or classical vignettes—like an Ottoman guild refusing to adopt a technology that would displace craftsmanship or the scribes in Istanbul—showing how worldview shaped policy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Revised Intro & Chapter Titles**\n\nHere’s a **sample revision** that incorporates these critiques while maintaining your overarching framework:\n\n### **Revised Introduction**  \n**“A House Built on the Fitrah: Rediscovering Our Divine Center”**  \n- **Core Thesis**: Ground the entire dilemma in the concept of *fitrah*—humanity’s innate inclination toward God—and how modern “progress” often obscures this orientation.  \n- **Philosophical Contrast**: Contrast Enlightenment-era faith in endless progress and human autonomy with an Islamic worldview that insists on reliance on God (*tawakkul*) and moral responsibility as the core of real development.  \n- **Story**: Keep the pandemic anecdote, but anchor it in spiritual terms: “During lockdown, we accidentally stumbled onto a moment closer to our *fitrah*—simpler living, clearer skies, caring for neighbors. How might we return there by conscious choice, guided by God’s signs, rather than forced crises?”  \n- **Logical Proof**: Cite a blend of Qur’anic references (e.g., “He who created you from a single soul” [4:1], illusions of the worldly life) and real-world data (lockdown pollution reduction, surges in inequality). Emphasize that if we don’t realign with God, short-term solutions revert to deeper crises.\n\n### **Revised Chapter Flow & Titles**  \n\n1. **Chapter 1: “The Soul’s Dilemma: Why Modern Progress Feels Empty”**  \n   - Ground the tension in the soul’s yearning for the divine, while modernity idolizes infinite material growth.\n\n2. **Chapter 2: “From Ghaflah (Heedlessness) to Muhasabah (Self-Awareness)”**  \n   - Show how heedlessness (ghaflah) perpetuates muddy-boot living. Introduce muhasabah as an Islamic practice to realign one’s intentions and actions.\n\n3. **Chapter 3: “Faith and Fitrah: Building an Inner Architecture of Tawakkul”**  \n   - Explore how trusting God can erode fear-driven consumption and open the path to contentment (*qanaʿa*).\n\n4. **Chapter 4: “Halal Rizq and True Development”**  \n   - Emphasize the link between lawful earning/spending and societal well-being—citing classical scholars’ works (e.g., Al-Ghazālī on permissible trade, Ottoman guild examples).\n\n5. **Chapter 5: “When Work Becomes Worship: Niyyah in Commerce and Community”**  \n   - Show how correct intention transforms ordinary tasks into service to God. Include your “Baraka Business Canvas,” referencing classical “ḥisbah” (market regulation) concepts.\n\n6. **Chapter 6: “The Generosity Factor: Zakat, Sadaqah, and the Abundance of Faith”**  \n   - Connect generosity with deeper theological underpinnings (e.g., “charity does not decrease wealth”). Provide real-life case studies of Islamic societies that thrived on communal welfare.\n\n7. **Chapter 7: “Jamaʿa (Community) as a Shield: Supporting Each Other’s Return to Fitrah”**  \n   - Emphasize the social dimension of spiritual growth, referencing Prophet Muḥammad’s (ﷺ) community-building strategies and possible modern parallels (monthly Zoom groups, local halqas, etc.).\n\n8. **Chapter 8: “Striving for Ihsan: The Path from Muddy Boots to Illuminated Footsteps”**  \n   - Summarize how spiritual excellence (ihsan) can infuse the mundane with sacred purpose, reshaping personal lifestyles and broader societal frameworks. Provide final muhasabah and a forward-looking vision.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Ways to Incorporate Karim Lahham’s Critique**\n\n1. **Add Metaphysical Depth**  \n   - Open the introduction with a direct mention of how God, the Creator, sets our *fitrah*. Use classical references (Qur’an, hadith, scholarship) to establish a solid theological basis for your practical suggestions.  \n   - Weave more scriptural support throughout each chapter, ensuring readers see these solutions not just as “nice moral suggestions” but as anchored in a God-centered worldview.\n\n2. **Emphasize *Tawakkul* as a Throughline**  \n   - In each chapter, show how relying on God reorients everything from daily decision-making to large-scale economic structures. For instance, highlight how *tawakkul* breaks the cycle of perpetual “progress” mania by reminding us that *risk (provision) ultimately comes from God*.\n\n3. **Use More Islamic Historical Context**  \n   - Illustrate how certain Islamic civilizations negotiated technology, trade expansions, and social structures with an eye on moral/ethical constraints. E.g., the scribes’ resistance to the printing press in the Ottoman Empire, or the way marketplaces were regulated (ḥisbah).\n\n4. **Elevate the Language of Chapter Titles & Flow**  \n   - Replace purely English secular titles with references to Islamic concepts (e.g., “ghaflah,” “muhasabah,” “tawakkul,” “qanaʿa,” “ihsan”). This signals the book’s deeper spiritual grounding.\n\n5. **Address Philosophical Critiques of Modernity**  \n   - Explicitly call out the “anthropocentric” or “secular rationalist” mindset since Descartes. Show how Islam’s paradigm differs: “Man is not the measure of all things; God is.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Summary of the Karim Lahham–Style Revision**\n\n- **Focus**: A more **metaphysically grounded** approach, ensuring the book isn’t perceived as a purely socio-environmental critique with “Islamic garnish,” but a thorough re-centering of daily life and economic structures upon God.  \n- **Tone**: Slightly more **scholarly** and **classically rooted**, with straightforward references to Qur’an, hadith, and Islamic jurisprudence or ethical thought.  \n- **Value**: Balances the personal transformation emphasis with **intellectual rigor** and **historical examples**, appealing both to devout Muslims craving traditional scholarship and to open-minded non-Muslims intrigued by an authentically Islamic response to modern crises.\n\n---\n\n### **Incorporating Karim Lahham’s Critique: The Outcome**\n\nBy adjusting the intro and chapter titles to reflect **core Islamic concepts** (fitrah, tawakkul, ghaflah, ihsan) and weaving in **theological and historical context**, you’ll create a **deeper, more cohesive** book—one that resonates on multiple levels: spiritually, intellectually, and practically.",

      "content": "Below is a **hypothetical critique** from a scholar we’ll call **Hassan Spiker**, offering his own emphasis on **Islamic metaphysics, traditional scholarship, and philosophical coherence**. We then propose **how he might modify** the introduction, chapter flow, and framing of your book to reflect these priorities.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Hassan Spiker’s Possible Critiques**\n\n1. **Greater Emphasis on Tawhīd (Divine Oneness) in the Argument Structure**  \n   - **Critique**: *“If the book highlights worldly challenges—consumerism, inequality, climate crisis—it must foreground that these are ultimately results of a disruption in our orientation to God’s Oneness. Tawhīd is not just a theological concept; it’s the bedrock that orders human life and the cosmos.”*  \n   - **Integration**: Ensure every major point (e.g., illusions of progress, muddy boots analogy) ties back to how forgetting God’s Oneness leads to fragmented, hollow pursuits.\n\n2. **Need for a Clear Ontological Hierarchy**  \n   - **Critique**: *“Modern confusions often arise because we flatten reality into material or psychological terms. The traditional Islamic worldview affirms a hierarchy—from the Divine Names and Attributes to the spiritual, intellectual, and material realms. Without a framework of higher metaphysics, readers may not grasp why worldly solutions alone fail.”*  \n   - **Integration**: Early in the text, outline a simplified ‘map of reality’: the unseen, the intellect (ʿaql), the heart (qalb), the soul (nafs), and the body. Show how each dimension interplays with commerce, social structures, and the environment.\n\n3. **Classical Philosophy and Kalām (Islamic Theology) References**  \n   - **Critique**: *“The book’s narrative is strong but might risk sounding purely motivational. We should anchor these insights in the tradition—such as references to Ibn Sīnā, Imam al-Ghazālī’s concept of al-ʿilm al-ladunnī (divine knowledge), or the kalām-based arguments about divine wisdom (ḥikmah). This lends intellectual depth and continuity with classical scholarship.”*  \n   - **Integration**: Pepper each chapter with brief but potent classical references. For instance, link Al-Ghazālī’s concept of spiritual illusions (*ghurūr*) to modern illusions of progress.\n\n4. **Articulation of the Role of Reason (ʿAql) vs. Revelation (Waḥy)**  \n   - **Critique**: *“The tension in modernity often stems from over-reliance on reason divorced from revelation. Show readers that revelation doesn’t contradict reason; rather, it perfects and elevates it. Our worldview—and thus our solutions—must be guided by waḥy if we want to exit the spiral of purely secular thinking.”*  \n   - **Integration**: Weave in references to how reason alone might chase illusions (e.g., indefinite progress), but reason coupled with revelation calls for humility, ethical guidelines, and deeper spiritual aims.\n\n5. **Balancing the Macro and the Micro**  \n   - **Critique**: *“It’s beneficial to discuss personal transformations (muhasabah, daily prayers). But we must also address the bigger structural or cosmic ‘story’: how do societies—through law, institutions, or common customs—manifest tawhīd collectively?”*  \n   - **Integration**: Include a chapter or sections on the role of ethical governance (historical examples like the ḥisbah system or the early caliphate’s approach to social welfare) to illustrate how micro-changes tie into a larger tapestry.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **How Hassan Spiker Might Modify the Intro**\n\n### **Revised Introduction Title**  \n**“From the Fragmented World to the Oneness of God: Rediscovering Our Place in the Cosmos”**\n\n1. **Open with Tawhīd**  \n   - Start by describing how the world’s frantic attempts to “fix” external crises reflect a deeper crisis of **forgetting God’s Oneness**.  \n   - Cite a short Qur’anic passage (e.g., “Say, He is Allah, the One,” [112:1]) to establish the principle that *all multiplicities and apparent contradictions find true unity under God*.\n\n2. **Introduce Metaphysical Hierarchy**  \n   - Briefly sketch the classical Islamic view: from the Divine Reality (al-Ḥaqq) to angels, souls, nature, and so on.  \n   - Show that ignoring this hierarchy leads to the illusions fueling modern crises—people think they can treat creation (nature, other humans) as mere resources, forgetting the cosmic order under God’s Will.\n\n3. **Narrate the Pandemic Anecdote with a Metaphysical Lens**  \n   - Frame the lockdown moment not just as a practical slowdown but as a *forced glimpse into a more primordial state*.  \n   - Explain that such a state reveals the “veils” of consumerism parted for an instant—realizing we do not “own” our environment nor does technology quell all anxiety.\n\n4. **Position Reason & Revelation**  \n   - Show that purely material or rational solutions (like geoengineering or AI-driven efficiency) ignore the deeper disease: a soul disconnected from Divine guidance.  \n   - Summarize how the rest of the book will ground practical solutions in a worldview shaped by *both* reason (ʿaql) and revelation (waḥy).\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Potential Adjustments to Chapter Flow**\n\nBelow is a **concise re-labeling** of the chapters, incorporating Hassan Spiker’s emphasis on **tawhīd, metaphysics, and classical references** while preserving the essence of your original structure.\n\n1. **Chapter 1**  \n   **“Remembering Oneness: The Roots of Our Fragmentation”**  \n   - Core Idea: Our crises stem from forgetting tawhīd, leading to a worldview of fragmentation (compartmentalizing faith from everyday life).\n\n2. **Chapter 2**  \n   **“Decoding Modern Illusions: Ghurūr, Ghaflah, and the Spiral of Secular Progress”**  \n   - Core Idea: Al-Ghazālī’s concept of self-delusion (ghurūr) + heedlessness (ghaflah) parallels the illusions of endless growth and consumerism.\n\n3. **Chapter 3**  \n   **“Soul, Intellect, and Heart: Reordering the Inner Cosmos”**  \n   - Core Idea: The classical Islamic ‘map’ of the self (nafs, ʿaql, qalb) and how aligning them with revelation fosters genuine well-being.\n\n4. **Chapter 4**  \n   **“Halal Rizq and Baraka: Economics in the Shade of Tawhīd”**  \n   - Core Idea: Ground the baraka-based business canvas in references to the ḥisbah tradition, encouraging an economy that reflects God’s harmony.\n\n5. **Chapter 5**  \n   **“From Work to Worship: Ihsān in Our Daily Actions”**  \n   - Core Idea: Merging your concept of “Niyyah Filter” with classical ideas of *ihsān*—excellence done with constant awareness of God.\n\n6. **Chapter 6**  \n   **“Tawakkul and the Communal Fabric: Structuring a Society That Remembers God”**  \n   - Core Idea: Explore social, communal, and institutional structures (like zakāt, waqf, endowment systems) that historically fostered reliance on God and mutual care.\n\n7. **Chapter 7**  \n   **“Facing the Future with ʿAql and Waḥy: Reclaiming Stewardship in a Changing World”**  \n   - Core Idea: Address advanced problems (AI, climate issues) not as purely “technical” but as moral/spiritual questions, integrating reason and revelation.\n\n8. **Chapter 8**  \n   **“Ihsān, Unity, and Beyond: Walking Barefoot Toward Our Origin”**  \n   - Core Idea: Conclude that returning to God’s Oneness is the ultimate path to wholeness. Summarize personal muhasabah practices, “baraka economy” principles, and communal steps.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Integrating Hassan Spiker’s Critique**\n\n1. **Elevate Tawhīd as a Foremost Principle**  \n   - Tie each material or moral problem back to the notion that *forgetting Oneness = internal and external chaos*. This resonates with the classical idea that “Whoever knows God, knows themselves and their purpose.”\n\n2. **Embed Metaphysics Early**  \n   - Add a dedicated section on the “hierarchy of existence” and how ignoring it fosters a purely horizontal approach—explaining why secular fixes keep failing at the spiritual or ontological level.\n\n3. **Use Classical References Liberally**  \n   - Even short quotes from Ibn ʿArabī, Al-Ghazālī, Ibn Taymiyyah, or Nasīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī can show the **intellectual lineage**.  \n   - E.g., link consumption mania to Al-Ghazālī’s discussion of *ḥub al-dunyā* (love of worldly life), or reference Ibn ʿArabī’s emphasis on the divine presence in creation.\n\n4. **Balance Individual and Collective**  \n   - Make sure readers see how personal muhasabah and spiritual practice extends to communal or systemic forms (like waqf, ethical markets, *shūrā* in governance). That synergy underscores the cosmic unity behind all.\n\n5. **Rational & Revealed Knowledge**  \n   - Show how the Prophet’s (ﷺ) guidance and Qur’anic revelations shape our moral imagination, while reason organizes real-life implementation—thus bridging the gap between “religious ideals” and “practical solutions.”\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: The Hassan Spiker–Style Revision**\n\nBy incorporating **more explicit metaphysical grounding**, referencing **classical scholarship**, and **articulating the interplay between reason and revelation**, your book ascends from a moral commentary or social analysis to a **robust, tradition-rooted treatise** on reconciling the modern world with the *tawhīdic* vision. Readers will see that the “muddy boots” problem is not merely a result of ignorance or hurried lifestyles—it’s the existential outcome of disconnection from God’s Oneness, and the remedy is as universal as it is spiritual.\n\n> **Key Value Added**: This approach imparts **philosophical depth, historical continuity, and doctrinal clarity**, resonating with readers seeking a serious, integrative Islamic critique of modernity—while still honoring the personal, practical, and economic frameworks you’ve already envisioned.",

      "content": "Below are a few **alternative metaphors and frameworks** that could carry the reader from start to finish—each aligning well with the spiritual, ecological, and personal transformation themes running through your book, **beyond** the “muddy boots” image:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **The Orchard Caretaker**\n\n### **Core Metaphor**  \n- **Vision**: Imagine your life, community, and wider world as an **orchard** that you’re entrusted to nurture. Each tree has its own fruit, its own timeline, and its own needs.  \n- **Meaning**: Just as the orchard caretaker must tend the soil, prune excessive branches, and wait patiently for harvest, we must patiently cultivate our personal habits, spiritual commitments, business choices, and relationships.  \n- **Why It Works**:\n  - **Synergy**: The orchard thrives only when each element—soil fertility, pollinators, sunlight, the caretaker’s touch—aligns. Analogous to how personal, communal, and spiritual dimensions must align in a truly “baraka-infused” economy.  \n  - **Pacing**: Orchards evoke slow, steady growth over frantic, forced solutions. This parallels your emphasis on slowing down, reorienting, and letting good practices bear fruit in time.  \n\n### **How to Use It**  \n1. **Planting**: Introduce the orchard caretaker metaphor in the introduction—“We start with barren land or neglected trees, much like we find our society and ourselves.”  \n2. **Seasons of Growth**: Chapters can reflect orchard seasons (Winter Dormancy = stepping back, reflection; Spring = new growth, business or personal shifts; Summer = deepening commitment; Autumn Harvest = reaping the fruit of spiritual work).  \n3. **Caretaker’s Daily Tasks**: Link practical routines (muhasabah, giving, mindful consumption) to orchard tasks (weeding, pruning, watering) so readers see how small acts accumulate into abundant harvests.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **The Tapestry Weavers**\n\n### **Core Metaphor**  \n- **Vision**: Envision our collective human experience as a **grand tapestry** we are weaving together. Each thread (personal acts, relationships, economic choices) intersects and creates the final pattern.  \n- **Meaning**: When we’re not mindful, the tapestry becomes tangled or dull. By weaving with intention—rooted in worship and service—we restore beauty and coherence to the design.  \n- **Why It Works**:\n  - **Connectivity**: A tapestry instantly invokes interdependence. You can’t fix a hole by ignoring the surrounding threads. Likewise, you can’t solve climate or inequality without rethinking your own “thread” in the system.  \n  - **Guiding Pattern**: Revelation, spiritual insight, and moral frameworks become the “pattern” we’re following. We see how each thread (our personal or economic choices) must conform to a divine blueprint of justice, humility, and generosity.\n\n### **How to Use It**  \n1. **Multiple Threads**: Each chapter might focus on one “strand” of life—e.g., personal reflection, communal generosity, baraka-based business, etc.—showing how it connects to all others.  \n2. **Tangling vs. Harmonizing**: Keep referring back to whether we’re weaving with “muddy,” unexamined threads or pure, ethically sourced ones.  \n3. **The Loom**: The loom could symbolize spiritual practice, holding everything in tension and alignment. The weaver is each of us, guided by revelation and reason.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **The Lighthouse and the Tide**\n\n### **Core Metaphor**  \n- **Vision**: We live on a shore where the **tide** of consumerism, anxiety, and “fix-it-fast” solutions constantly ebbs and flows. Our task is to build a **lighthouse**—a guiding beam of clarity, worship, and ethical living that stands unmoved by the rising waters.  \n- **Meaning**:  \n  - **Tide** = the endless wave of new crises, distractions, and illusions of progress.  \n  - **Lighthouse** = a stable orientation rooted in tawhīd, muhasabah, and baraka.  \n- **Why It Works**:\n  - **Incessant Crises**: Tides rise daily; society’s crises seem unending. Yet the lighthouse stands firm, shining out.  \n  - **Clarity & Service**: A lighthouse doesn’t forcibly fix the tide; it illuminates the path so ships (or societies) navigate more safely.\n\n### **How to Use It**  \n1. **Establish the Symbol**: Early chapters define the core “foundation” of the lighthouse—spiritual reliance, personal discipline, mindful economic choices.  \n2. **Tidal Surges**: Each new wave (climate anxiety, technological disruption, personal doubts) tests the lighthouse’s stability.  \n3. **Light Beaming Out**: As you build up business frameworks, generosity practices, or communal connections, the lighthouse’s beam reaches farther, aiding others in your community.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **The Heart-Soil Connection**\n\n### **Core Metaphor**  \n- **Vision**: The **heart** (qalb) is like **soil**, needing regular tilling and nourishing to yield good fruit. If we never remove the “weeds” (greed, fear, heedlessness), any surface-level solution soon chokes and dies.  \n- **Meaning**: In Islamic tradition, the heart is the seat of understanding, sincerity, and connection to God. Society’s external reforms fail if hearts remain untilled.  \n- **Why It Works**:\n  - **Deep Spiritual Roots**: The heart-soil metaphor resonates with classical Sufi teachings.  \n  - **Practical**: Tilling the heart ties to muhasabah (turning the soil), dhikr (watering), and mindful action (planting seeds).  \n- **How to Use It**:  \n  1. **Seed** = new intentions or ethical business ideas.  \n  2. **Weeds** = illusions, extravagance, riba-based profit, etc.  \n  3. **Sun & Water** = prayer, charity, community synergy.  \n  4. **Harvest** = contentment, baraka-based prosperity, deeper relationships.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **How These Metaphors Complement “Muddy Boots”**\n\n- **Muddy Boots** is a great short image for how we track problems everywhere we go.  \n- You could pair it with a **longer, overarching metaphor** that sees the entire process as orchard care, weaving a tapestry, building a lighthouse, or tending heart-soil.  \n- For instance, you might **open** the book with “muddy boots” to illustrate the *immediate* crisis, then **introduce** “the orchard caretaker” (or another metaphor) for the deeper, long-haul transformation.  \n  - Example: “Once we notice our boots are muddy, how do we ensure we don’t keep re-soiling the orchard we’re meant to cultivate?”\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Choosing the Best Fit**\n\nWhen selecting one overarching metaphor:\n1. **Audience Resonance**: If you want a more **“agricultural”** feel that links well with sustainability and slow living, **The Orchard Caretaker** or **Heart-Soil** might be best.  \n2. **Community & Interconnectedness**: If you want to emphasize how every action is woven into communal fabric, **The Tapestry** is powerful.  \n3. **Guidance & Steadfastness**: If your audience relates more to storms and uncertainty, the **Lighthouse** metaphor directly addresses “rising tides” and illusions of progress.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Example of Weaving the New Metaphor Through Chapters**\n\nTake **The Orchard Caretaker** as an example:\n\n- **Introduction**: “We’re all orchard caretakers—yet we wander in wearing muddy boots, stepping on the roots and choking the soil with our frantic fixes. This book invites us to remove those muddy boots, befriend the orchard, and patiently nurture it.”\n- **Ch. 1**: “Survey the Soil”—Identify illusions of progress.  \n- **Ch. 2**: “Removing Weeds”—Spot personal contradictions, consumer traps, etc.  \n- **Ch. 3**: “Watering with Worship”—Establish daily prayer, muhasabah as the orchard’s water supply.  \n- **Ch. 4**: “Pruning Excess”—Halal livelihood, avoiding riba, rethinking hustle culture.  \n- **Ch. 5**: “Pollinators and Partnerships”—Community, generosity, group synergy.  \n- **Ch. 6**: “Harvesting Baraka”—How mindful business, family care, local solutions bring sweet fruit.  \n- **Conclusion**: “An Orchard in Every Home”—Encourage readers to replicate orchard caretaker mindsets wherever they are.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\n\nEach of these metaphors can run **deeper** than a one-liner, allowing you to tie **every** chapter to a unifying image or process. It resonates with both **spiritual** traditions (patient cultivation, weaving, guiding light, nurturing the heart-soil) and the **practical** dimension (small, habitual steps matter, synergy with nature and community). \n\nChoosing one central metaphor—whether an orchard, tapestry, lighthouse, or heart-soil—can complement the **muddy boots** image by offering the sustained “scaffolding” for your book’s entire journey.",

      "content": "Below are **ten potential “beautiful questions”** that aim to be ambitious, actionable, perspective-shifting, and catalytic for meaningful change. After listing them, we’ll choose three top contenders and then settle on a single question through a brief pro/con analysis.\n\n---\n\n## **Ten Ideas for a Beautiful Question**\n\n1. **“What if everything we needed to flourish already exists in our current circle of relationships and resources—and what would it look like to recognize and use them as blessings rather than obstacles?”**  \n   - *Ambitious*: Calls for a paradigm shift from scarcity to abundance.  \n   - *Actionable*: Encourages re-inventorying your immediate network and environment.  \n   - *Catalyst*: Instantly reframes consumerism and fosters gratitude.\n\n2. **“In a world obsessed with quick solutions and global impact, how might we slow down and rediscover the sacredness of local effort, ordinary tasks, and small, consistent acts of faith?”**  \n   - *Ambitious*: Challenges the big-splash approach to progress.  \n   - *Actionable*: Points to concrete daily habits and local involvement.  \n   - *Catalyst*: Urges a radical reorientation of scale and pace.\n\n3. **“If our greatest wealth lies in invisible qualities—trust, integrity, presence—how could we redesign business and community life to measure and multiply those ‘intangible assets’ instead of just material gain?”**  \n   - *Ambitious*: Reinvents the yardsticks of success.  \n   - *Actionable*: Suggests new metrics, new business practices.  \n   - *Catalyst*: Could push readers toward bold experiments in alternative economies.\n\n4. **“What would our world look like if every individual approached their work as a spiritual craft, an offering to the Divine, rather than a race toward productivity or profit?”**  \n   - *Ambitious*: Redefines ‘work’ at its core.  \n   - *Actionable*: Encourages each person to reframe their daily tasks.  \n   - *Catalyst*: Might transform personal and collective motivation systems.\n\n5. **“How might we fully embrace death as a natural limit and teacher—so that our pursuits become more compassionate, meaningful, and less fearful?”**  \n   - *Ambitious*: Confronts the taboo of death.  \n   - *Actionable*: Invites reflection on end-of-life planning, daily gratitude, and moral clarity.  \n   - *Catalyst*: Shifts from frantic accumulation to purposeful living.\n\n6. **“In an era of AI and endless ‘innovation,’ what if our best inventions were methods to deepen presence, empathy, and humility—rather than devices to outsmart or replace one another?”**  \n   - *Ambitious*: Flips the usual narrative of technology as endless progress.  \n   - *Actionable*: Could lead to new design briefs or AI applications focusing on human flourishing.  \n   - *Catalyst*: Recalibrates our approach to progress and tech adoption.\n\n7. **“If each purchase and transaction is a vote for the kind of world we want, how would our marketplaces change if we saw every economic choice as worship or as moral responsibility?”**  \n   - *Ambitious*: Challenges the notion of neutrality in consumerism.  \n   - *Actionable*: Encourages alignment between beliefs and daily spending.  \n   - *Catalyst*: Could galvanize consumer-based activism and faith-driven markets.\n\n8. **“How can we replace the endless pursuit of ‘more’ with a quest for ‘enoughness’—so that our measure of success is tied to shared well-being rather than relentless growth?”**  \n   - *Ambitious*: Questions the growth paradigm.  \n   - *Actionable*: Suggests introspection about personal thresholds of “enough.”  \n   - *Catalyst*: Helps unify personal contentment with ecological and economic sustainability.\n\n9. **“In a moment when fear and division dominate, how might we cultivate communities so profoundly caring and honest that they naturally uproot social ills and environmental harm?”**  \n   - *Ambitious*: Envisions communities as the main solution to macro problems.  \n   - *Actionable*: Nudges readers to local organizing, mutual aid, and conflict resolution.  \n   - *Catalyst*: Moves from top-down approaches to ground-up transformation.\n\n10. **“If we recognized that all outward problems—ecological, economic, social—reflect the state of our collective hearts, how would we treat inner growth as the essential first step to healing the world?”**  \n   - *Ambitious*: Requires deep spiritual introspection.  \n   - *Actionable*: Could spur personal repentance, muhasabah, spiritual practices.  \n   - *Catalyst*: Merges personal development with global activism.\n\n---\n\n## **Picking Three Contenders**\n\nFrom these ten, let’s highlight three that might resonate especially strongly with the themes of baraka, spiritual economics, and personal transformation:\n\n1. **#3:** *“If our greatest wealth lies in invisible qualities—trust, integrity, presence—how could we redesign business and community life to measure and multiply those ‘intangible assets’ instead of just material gain?”*\n\n2. **#7:** *“If each purchase and transaction is a vote for the kind of world we want, how would our marketplaces change if we saw every economic choice as worship or as moral responsibility?”*\n\n3. **#8:** *“How can we replace the endless pursuit of ‘more’ with a quest for ‘enoughness’—so that our measure of success is tied to shared well-being rather than relentless growth?”*\n\n---\n\n## **Pro/Con Analysis of These Three**\n\n### **Question #3** \n**Pros**  \n- Centers on the shift from visible, numeric wealth (money, GDP) to intangible but crucial qualities (integrity, presence, spiritual well-being).  \n- Offers a clear call for innovation—new metrics, new economic principles.  \n- Highly relevant for *baraka-based frameworks*, as baraka itself is an intangible blessing.  \n\n**Cons**  \n- Might be too business-oriented. If your book aims at general readers who don’t all do business, it may feel niche.  \n- Requires more elaboration on measurement strategies—risks drifting into abstract moral appeals if not carefully developed.\n\n### **Question #7** \n**Pros**  \n- Directly addresses day-to-day consumer behavior, hitting home for *everyone*.  \n- Ties well with the notion of *halal rizq*, worship through commerce, and moral spending.  \n- Immediately actionable—people can start rethinking purchases today.  \n\n**Cons**  \n- Could be perceived as guilt-inducing if not handled carefully.  \n- Focuses heavily on consumer activism, which might underrepresent broader spiritual or communal transformations.\n\n### **Question #8** \n**Pros**  \n- Gets right to the heart of the “endless progress” vs. “contentedness” tension.  \n- Emphasizes moral and ecological sustainability—timely and wide-reaching.  \n- Bridges personal and systemic changes, asking readers to define “enough” individually and socially.  \n\n**Cons**  \n- “Enoughness” is a delicate term; some might interpret it as anti-ambition.  \n- People can be reluctant to let go of the “growth mindset”; might require extensive theological and practical backing.\n\n---\n\n## **Selecting One**\n\nGiven the book’s overarching goals—blending spiritual economics, personal transformation, and tangible shifts in daily life—**Question #7** might be the most universally **resonant** and **actionable** for a broad audience:\n\n> **“If each purchase and transaction is a vote for the kind of world we want, how would our marketplaces change if we saw every economic choice as worship or as moral responsibility?”**\n\n### **Why #7?**  \n1. **Universal Relevance**: Everyone spends money and faces daily consumer choices—so it grabs the largest demographic.  \n2. **Direct Ties to Worship**: The question elegantly merges economic decisions with spiritual accountability, aligning with your book’s core premise of *baraka and worshipful living*.  \n3. **Scalable Impact**: Simple changes in spending can accumulate into significant moral and social shifts, bridging personal practice and public economy.  \n\n**Potential Next Steps**  \n- Open a chapter with this question, illustrating how small consumer decisions mirror deeper values.  \n- Show real-world examples of individuals or communities reorienting their purchasing.  \n- Develop a moral/spiritual spending framework (e.g., “Check your intention before you buy anything”).  \n- Extend the conversation into forming new cooperatives, halal supply chains, or baraka-based businesses.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nWhile all ten questions can stimulate a transformative journey, **Question #7** best matches **ambition, actionability, and worldview shift** for the widest audience—leading readers toward a spiritual reflection on everyday economic life and catalyzing meaningful change.",
