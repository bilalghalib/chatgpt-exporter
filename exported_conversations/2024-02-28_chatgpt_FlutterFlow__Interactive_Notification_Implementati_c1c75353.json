      "content": "Yes, you can use FlutterFlow to create a native application that includes a feature for sending notifications with interactive elements, like input fields where users can enter a number. FlutterFlow offers a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface to build Flutter apps, and it supports various functionalities including push notifications and user input handling.\n\nHere's a general approach to implement this in FlutterFlow:\n\n1. **Notification Setup**: Use FlutterFlow's integration with Firebase to set up push notifications. You'll need to configure Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for your app.\n\n2. **Interactive Notifications**: For the interactive part of the notification (like entering a number), FlutterFlow itself might not have direct support for this advanced feature. You may need to write custom Flutter code or use a Flutter package that supports interactive notifications.\n\n3. **Handling Input**: Once the user enters a number through the notification, you would handle this input in your Flutter app's logic. This could involve storing the number, performing calculations, or triggering other actions in the app.\n\n4. **Custom Code**: If FlutterFlow's built-in widgets and functionalities don't cover your needs, you can write custom Flutter code and integrate it with your FlutterFlow project.\n\n5. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the notification feature on different devices to ensure it works as expected.\n\nIt's important to note that interactive notifications can be more complex to implement compared to standard push notifications, and might require additional coding outside of the FlutterFlow environment. Make sure to refer to FlutterFlow's documentation and community resources for specific guidance.",
