Our task is to identify a list of a variety of tasks that they need to do and find ways that AI tools, particularly large language models, can help them. Ask questions you need to deepen your understanding. Our goal is to make a table with a list of tasks in one column and a % time column, a column with how it can be helped by AI followed by a % reduction in time column.",

However, to generate a detailed and accurate task list, it would be great if you could provide me some more information:\n\n1. What is the field or sector of these social enterprises and nonprofits? For instance, healthcare, education, environment, etc. \n2. What are some of the specific tasks they're currently performing that they find time-consuming or challenging?\n3. What is their current level of digital literacy or familiarity with AI tools?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can create a table that's tailored to their needs.",

      "content": "Thank you for providing more details. It's great that you are looking into ways of streamlining these tasks using AI tools. Let's explore how a large language model such as ChatGPT can assist in these tasks:\n\n| Task | % Time Spent | How AI Can Help | Estimated % Reduction in Time |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Selection Process | 20% | AI can pre-screen applications based on defined criteria. | 50% |\n| Outreach Programs | 15% | AI can automate emails and social media posts. | 60% |\n| Marketing Material Creation | 15% | AI can generate initial drafts and ideas for marketing material. | 50% |\n| Report Writing | 15% | AI can create drafts or provide templates for report writing. | 50% |\n| Grant Writing | 20% | AI can help write drafts and proofread grant proposals. | 50% |\n| Finding Grants | 15% | AI can search for and filter relevant grants based on certain criteria. | 60% |\n\nPlease note that the time percentages and reduction estimates are hypothetical and may vary based on the specific processes and tasks at hand. \n\nIt's also crucial to understand that while AI, especially language models like ChatGPT, can be powerful in these areas, there will always be a need for human intervention. AI can help with drafting, ideas, and even initial analysis, but human input is essential for final decisions and quality control. \n\nLastly, for organizations with beginner-level AI skills, it would be valuable to provide some training or orientation to maximize the use of these AI tools. It is also worth noting that using AI tools should not replace staff, but rather supplement their work and make them more efficient.",
