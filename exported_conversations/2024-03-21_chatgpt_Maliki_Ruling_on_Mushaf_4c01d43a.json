      "content": "The Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, like other Sunni schools, has specific opinions and rulings regarding various aspects of Islamic practice, including the reading from a large Mushaf (Quran) during prayers. According to Maliki fiqh, the following points are generally considered:\n\n1. **Reading from the Mushaf During Individual Prayer**: In the Maliki school, it is generally permissible for an individual to read from the Mushaf during voluntary (nafl) prayers, especially if it helps in reciting more Quran or correcting one’s recitation. However, this should not lead to excessive movement that would invalidate the prayer.\n\n2. **Reading from the Mushaf in Obligatory Prayers**: For obligatory prayers, the traditional view in the Maliki school tends to discourage reading from the Mushaf, particularly for the Imam in congregational prayers. This is based on the practice and tradition of the Prophet Muhammad, who is not reported to have read from the Mushaf during his prayers. However, there may be some leniency for someone who hasn’t memorized enough Quran to complete their prayer without it.\n\n3. **Size of the Mushaf**: Regarding the size of the Mushaf, there’s no specific restriction in the Maliki school. The concern is more about the act of holding and reading from the Mushaf during prayer, rather than the size of it. However, practical considerations (like managing a large Mushaf without causing excessive movement or distraction) would apply.\n\n4. **Modern Applications**: In contemporary practice, especially given the variety of circumstances Muslims find themselves in (such as new converts or those with limited access to learning), some Maliki scholars may offer more flexible rulings to accommodate different needs.\n\nIt's important to note that these views can vary among scholars within the Maliki school, and different contexts and situations may lead to different rulings. For a specific ruling applicable to an individual's circumstance, consulting a knowledgeable and trusted scholar in the Maliki tradition is recommended.",

      "content": "In the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, there is a clear emphasis on making up missed prayers, even if they were missed many years ago. This view is based on the general principle in Islam that obligations, particularly obligatory prayers, must be fulfilled once they are due. Here are the key points regarding this issue in the Maliki school:\n\n1. **Obligation to Make Up Missed Prayers**: According to Malikis, any obligatory prayers that have been missed intentionally or unintentionally should be made up, regardless of how much time has passed since they were missed. This is because the obligation to perform these prayers does not lapse over time.\n\n2. **Intention for Making Up Missed Prayers**: When making up these prayers, it is important to have the correct intention. This means that the person should know specifically which missed prayer they are making up (for example, “I am making up the Fajr prayer from such-and-such a day”).\n\n3. **Order of Making Up Missed Prayers**: Ideally, missed prayers should be made up in the order they were missed. However, if a person has missed many prayers and cannot remember the order, they should still make them up in a general sense.\n\n4. **No Time Limit for Completion**: There is no specific time limit for making up the missed prayers. The person should begin to make them up and continue to do so regularly until all missed prayers are completed.\n\n5. **Practical Approach**: If a person has missed a large number of prayers, scholars often advise to start by gradually increasing the number of prayers made up each day, without causing undue hardship. This should be balanced with the regular daily prayers.\n\n6. **Seeking Forgiveness and Repentance**: Alongside making up missed prayers, seeking forgiveness and repenting for neglecting them in the first place is also recommended. This is part of the broader Islamic teaching on repentance and turning back to God.\n\nAs always, interpretations and applications of Islamic law can vary, and for personal religious guidance, especially in complex or unusual situations, it is best to consult with a qualified Islamic scholar or a Mufti who is well-versed in the Maliki school of jurisprudence.",

      "content": "When dealing with missed prayers where there is uncertainty about the exact number or specific prayers missed, as in your example where you estimate missing about 20% of the prayers in a certain year, the Maliki approach, like other schools of Islamic jurisprudence, offers guidance to handle such situations. The key is to approach the matter with sincerity and a reasonable effort to fulfill the obligation. Here's what you can consider:\n\n1. **Estimating Missed Prayers**: Since you have an estimate (like 80% prayed and 20% missed), you can use this to calculate the number of prayers to make up. This calculation doesn't have to be exact but should be a sincere and reasonable estimate.\n\n2. **Making Up Estimated Prayers**: Once you have an estimate of the number of missed prayers, you can start making them up. This should be done alongside your regular daily prayers. For example, you might decide to add one or more make-up prayers to your daily routine.\n\n3. **Prioritizing Daily Prayers**: It's important to prioritize the current obligatory prayers while also gradually making up for the past missed ones. Ensure that your effort to make up missed prayers does not lead to negligence of the current prayers.\n\n4. **Intention for Making Up**: When making up these prayers, your intention might be less specific since you may not know exactly which prayer you missed. In such cases, your intention can be general, like “I am making up one of the missed Fajr prayers.”\n\n5. **Seeking Forgiveness**: In addition to making up missed prayers, seeking forgiveness from Allah for the oversight or negligence is a recommended practice. This should be accompanied by repentance and a sincere intention not to miss prayers in the future.\n\n6. **Practical Approach**: If the number of prayers to be made up is large, it’s advised to take a gradual and consistent approach. You might decide to make up a certain number of prayers per day or week, for example.\n\n7. **Consulting a Scholar**: In cases of uncertainty or complexity, consulting a knowledgeable and trusted Islamic scholar is advisable. They can provide personalized advice and guidance based on your specific situation and the principles of the Maliki school.\n\nRemember, the key is the sincere effort to fulfill your obligations and the continuous effort to maintain your daily prayers. The approach to making up missed prayers is meant to be a means of rectifying past lapses while encouraging a more disciplined approach to prayer in the future.",

      "content": "In the context of making up missed obligatory (fardh) prayers, the rulings that apply to these make-up prayers generally follow the rulings of the original obligatory prayers. So, when you are making up a missed fardh prayer, the prayer is considered fardh, not nawafil (voluntary). This distinction affects various aspects of how you perform the prayer, including the ruling on reading from a Mushaf.\n\nRegarding reading from a Mushaf in make-up prayers:\n\n1. **Reading from a Mushaf in Fardh Prayers**: In many Islamic schools of thought, including the Maliki school, reading from a Mushaf during fardh prayers is generally not recommended or is discouraged. This is because it differs from the practice of Prophet Muhammad, who did not read from a Mushaf during his prayers. The emphasis is on reciting what you have memorized.\n\n2. **Exceptional Circumstances**: However, in exceptional circumstances where a person does not have enough of the Quran memorized to complete their prayer properly, there may be some leniency allowing for the reading from a Mushaf. This is particularly applicable if it prevents the individual from abandoning the prayer altogether.\n\n3. **Minimal Movement**: If you must use a Mushaf, it is important to ensure that this does not lead to excessive movement or distraction. Placing the Mushaf on the ground near the place of sujud and reading from it with minimal movement can be a practical solution, as long as it doesn’t disrupt the flow and concentration of the prayer.\n\n4. **Large Mushaf for Easier Reading**: Using a large Mushaf that allows you to read without significant movement is a sensible approach. The key is to minimize the actions that are not part of the normal prayer sequence.\n\n5. **Priority to Memorization**: Ideally, working on memorizing more parts of the Quran for use in prayer is encouraged. This would reduce the dependency on reading from a Mushaf and align more closely with the traditional practice.\n\n6. **Consultation for Personal Situations**: Since these issues can be complex and sensitive, especially when it comes to individual capacities and circumstances, consulting with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar or a Mufti for personalized advice is highly recommended.\n\nIn summary, while using a Mushaf during make-up fardh prayers is not the standard practice and is generally discouraged, there can be some leniency in cases of need, with an emphasis on minimizing movement and distraction. The overall goal should be to gradually work towards praying without needing to read from a Mushaf.",

      "content": "Yes, having a Mushaf nearby during your prayers for reference while you're memorizing the Quran can be helpful, especially if you are still in the process of learning and occasionally get stuck. This approach is practical and can assist you in maintaining the flow of your prayer. Here are a few considerations for using a Mushaf in this way:\n\n1. **Minimal Disruption**: The key is to ensure that looking at the Mushaf causes minimal disruption to your prayer. This means you should try to keep your movements as subtle and limited as possible.\n\n2. **Placement of the Mushaf**: Placing the Mushaf in a location where it's easily viewable with minimal movement, such as on a stand or on the ground near your place of sujud (prostration), is a good practice. This allows you to glance at it quickly without significantly interrupting your prayer.\n\n3. **Using It Only When Necessary**: Try to rely on your memory as much as possible and use the Mushaf only when you really need to recover your place. This encourages your memorization process and maintains the flow and concentration of your prayer.\n\n4. **Continued Memorization Efforts**: While using the Mushaf in this manner, continue your efforts to memorize the Quran. Over time, your dependency on the Mushaf should decrease as your memorization improves.\n\n5. **Intention and Sincerity**: Maintain a sincere intention and a focus on the purpose of your prayer. Using the Mushaf as a support in your journey of Quran memorization and prayer can be seen as a part of your sincere effort to improve your religious practice.\n\n6. **Consultation for Personalized Guidance**: As always, personal circumstances can vary greatly, and if you are unsure about your specific situation, it's advisable to consult with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar. They can provide guidance tailored to your personal learning process and religious practice.\n\nThis approach of using a Mushaf as a memory aid during prayer, especially in the context of memorization and learning, can be a reasonable and beneficial practice as long as it is done with the intention to enhance your prayer and Quranic recitation.",

      "content": "In the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, the Fard (obligatory) acts of Wudu (ablution) are the essential steps without which the Wudu is considered invalid. The Malikis outline specific actions as obligatory in Wudu, and understanding these is important for ensuring that the ablution is correctly performed according to this school. Here are the Fard (obligatory) acts of Wudu in the Maliki school:\n\n1. **Washing the Face**: This includes everything from the top of the forehead to the bottom of the chin, and from ear to ear. The face must be washed thoroughly, ensuring that water reaches the skin under the eyebrows, beard, and mustache (if applicable).\n\n2. **Washing the Hands and Arms up to the Elbows**: This includes washing both the hands and the arms up to, and including, the elbows. It is obligatory to ensure that every part, including the elbows, is washed completely.\n\n3. **Washing the Feet up to the Ankles**: The feet must be washed up to, and including, the ankles. As with the arms, care must be taken to ensure that the entire foot, including the ankles, is washed thoroughly.\n\n4. **Wiping Part of the Head**: In the Maliki school, it is obligatory to wipe at least a quarter of the head. This can be done by passing wet hands over any part of the head.\n\n5. **Sequential Washing**: The obligatory acts of Wudu must be performed in sequence, one after the other without undue delay, which means that the acts should follow each other in the order they were mentioned, without long interruptions.\n\n6. **Intention (Niyyah)**: While intention is not considered a physical act of Wudu, it is essential to have the intention of performing Wudu in the heart at the beginning of the ablution process. This intention aligns the act with its purpose of purification for prayer.\n\n7. **Ensuring That Water Reaches the Skin**: It’s important to ensure that water reaches and covers the entire area of each of these parts, without any dry spots left.\n\nIt’s noteworthy that the Maliki school, like other Islamic schools of thought, also mentions Sunnah (recommended but not obligatory) acts of Wudu, which complement these obligatory acts. Additionally, the Maliki school emphasizes avoiding wastefulness in the use of water during Wudu.\n\nFor detailed guidance and application, especially for individual circumstances or in cases of doubts, consulting a knowledgeable scholar well-versed in the Maliki fiqh is advisable.",

Here is a step-by-step guide to performing Wudu according to the Maliki school, including both obligatory and recommended acts:\n\n1. **Niyyah (Intention)**: Begin with the intention in your heart to perform Wudu for the sake of Allah. Intention is not verbalized in the Maliki school, but it's an internal acknowledgment.\n\n2. **Washing the Hands** (Sunnah): Wash your hands up to the wrists three times, starting with the right hand and then the left.\n\n3. **Rinsing the Mouth** (Sunnah): Take water with your right hand, rinse your mouth thoroughly three times.\n\n4. **Inhaling Water into the Nose and Blowing it Out** (Sunnah): Sniff water into the nostrils using the right hand and then blow it out using the left hand. Do this three times.\n\n5. **Washing the Face** (Fard): Wash the entire face from the top of the forehead to the bottom of the chin, and from ear to ear, ensuring that the entire face is covered with water three times. Be sure to wash under the eyebrows, beard, and mustache if applicable.\n\n6. **Washing the Arms** (Fard): Wash your right arm, including the elbow, and then the left arm, including the elbow, three times each. Make sure to cover the entire area.\n\n7. **Wiping Over Part of the Head** (Fard): Wipe at least a quarter of your head with wet hands. In the Maliki school, it’s sufficient to wipe a part of the head.\n\n8. **Washing the Feet** (Fard): Wash the right foot, including the ankle, then the left foot, including the ankle, three times each. Ensure that water reaches between the toes.\n\nThroughout this process, the following should be observed:\n\n- **Sequential Order and Continuity**: Ensure that each step follows the other without significant interruption.\n\n- **Completeness and Thoroughness**: Make sure every part is washed properly, leaving no dry spots.\n\n- **Conserving Water**: To reduce water usage, use only a moderate amount of water for each step. You can do this by turning off the tap while you're performing the actions that don't require running water (like wiping your head) or using a small container of water.\n\n- **Gargling and Sniffing Water Gently**: Be gentle when gargling and sniffing water, especially when fasting.\n\n- **Using a Miswak or Toothbrush** (Sunnah): If possible, before starting Wudu, use a Miswak or toothbrush to clean your teeth.\n\nThe Maliki school places a strong emphasis on avoiding extravagance in using water. This not only fulfills the Sunnah of conservation but is also environmentally responsible. Remember, Wudu is both a physical and spiritual preparation for prayer, and performing it with mindfulness and humility enhances its spiritual benefits.",

In the Maliki school, the Sunnah acts for Wudu include:\n\n1. **Beginning with the Basmala**: Saying \"Bismillah\" (in the name of Allah) at the start of Wudu.\n\n2. **Washing the Hands up to the Wrists**: Before washing the face, washing the hands three times including the wrists.\n\n3. **Rinsing the Mouth**: Using water to rinse the mouth, ideally three times.\n\n4. **Cleansing the Nose**: Sniffing water into the nostrils and then gently blowing it out, preferably three times.\n\n5. **Brushing the Teeth**: Using a Miswak or toothbrush, particularly before the mouth rinse.\n\n6. **Washing Each Part Three Times**: The Sunnah is to wash the face, arms, and feet three times each, though washing them once is obligatory.\n\n7. **Passing Fingers through the Beard**: For men with beards, running the fingers through the beard.\n\n8. **Wiping the Entire Head**: While the obligatory act is to wipe only a portion of the head, the Sunnah is to wipe the entire head.\n\n9. **Wiping the Ears**: After wiping the head, it is Sunnah to wipe the inside and back of the ears with wet fingers.\n\n10. **Washing in the Correct Sequence**: Following the specific order of washing the face, then arms, wiping the head, and then washing the feet.\n\n11. **Maintaining Continuity**: Ensuring that the acts of Wudu are done successively, not allowing the washed parts to dry before completing the Wudu.\n\n12. **Renewing Water for Wiping the Head**: Ideally, one should renew the water on their hands (or take new water) before wiping the head, separate from the water used for washing the arms.\n\n13. **Du’a (Supplication) After Completion**: Reciting specific supplications or prayers after completing Wudu, such as the Shahada (Testimony of Faith) and a prayer for being among those who repent and purify themselves.\n\nPerforming these Sunnah acts is a way of following the Prophet’s example, contributing to the spiritual quality and completeness of one’s ablution. However, it's important to remember that omitting these Sunnah acts does not invalidate the Wudu itself, which is fulfilled by completing its obligatory (fard) elements.",

      "content": "In the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, the Fard (obligatory) acts of Wudu (ablution) are the minimum required actions for the Wudu to be valid. These are the essential steps that must be performed. Here are the Fard actions in Wudu according to Maliki fiqh:\n\n1. **Washing the Entire Face**: This includes washing from the top of the forehead to the bottom of the chin, and from ear to ear. It's essential to cover the whole face with water.\n\n2. **Washing the Arms Including the Elbows**: Both arms must be washed up to and including the elbows. Ensuring that the entire area from the fingertips to the elbows is covered with water is necessary.\n\n3. **Wiping Over a Portion of the Head**: In the Maliki school, it is obligatory to wipe at least a quarter of the head with wet hands. This differs from some other schools, which require wiping the whole head.\n\n4. **Washing the Feet Including the Ankles**: The feet must be washed up to and including the ankles. It's important to make sure the whole foot, including between the toes and the ankles, is washed.\n\n5. **Maintaining the Correct Sequential Order and Continuity**: The obligatory actions must be performed in their proper sequence without undue delay between them. This means that one should wash the face, then the arms, wipe over the head, and then wash the feet, in this order, without significant interruption.\n\nThese obligatory acts form the basis of Wudu in the Maliki school, and fulfilling them correctly is essential for the Wudu to be considered valid. The intention (Niyyah) of performing Wudu is a precondition and should be present, but it is not counted as a physical act of Wudu. As always, personal circumstances can vary, and in cases of doubt or special situations, consulting a knowledgeable scholar in the Maliki tradition is advisable.",

This is in line with evidence from Hadiths about the Prophet Muhammad allowing masah over leather socks.\n\n2. **Masah over Non-Leather Socks (like Wool Socks)**: Traditional Maliki fiqh is generally more restrictive about performing masah over non-leather socks. The school generally does not allow masah over regular wool socks, especially if they are thin or allow water to seep through. The conditions for masah in the Maliki school are generally strict and are typically met only by leather socks or similar materials.\n\n3. **Conditions for Masah**: When masah is allowed (like over leather socks), it's typically permitted for a resident for one day and night (24 hours) and for a traveler for three days and nights (72 hours) from the time of breaking the previous Wudu.\n\n4. **Washing the Feet**: In situations where masah over socks is not allowed, the feet must be washed as part of the Wudu. This means removing the wool socks to wash the entire foot up to and including the ankles.\n\nIt's important to note that Islamic jurisprudence is vast and diverse, and rulings can vary among scholars within the same school based on different interpretations of sources and evidence. For individuals who wear wool socks and are followers of the Maliki school, it is advisable to consult a contemporary Islamic scholar or a Mufti for specific guidance, especially as modern materials and types of socks might be considered differently from traditional ones.",

      "content": "The issue of performing Masah (wiping) over modern non-leather socks, such as those made with bamboo fibers, is a topic of contemporary Islamic jurisprudence that has sparked discussion among scholars, including those from the Maliki school. The traditional rulings of the Maliki school, as with other Sunni schools, are primarily based on the conditions of Masah over leather socks (khuffain), which are well-established in Islamic legal texts. The adaptation of these rules to modern materials like bamboo-lined socks is a matter of ijtihad (independent reasoning) by contemporary scholars.\n\nBased on the conditions you've mentioned, which align with traditional criteria for Masah over khuffs, a Maliki scholar today might consider the following points:\n\n1. **Fulfillment of Traditional Conditions**: If the bamboo-lined socks meet the conditions that you've listed (covering the entire ankle, durability for walking a certain distance, thickness, staying up without fastening, and resistance to water penetration), they might be viewed as analogous to leather socks in terms of the permissibility of Masah.\n\n2. **Scholarly Interpretation and Context**: Modern Maliki scholars may examine the context and the purpose behind the traditional conditions for Masah on khuffs and decide if modern materials like bamboo-lined socks fulfill the same objectives. This could include considerations of practicality, cleanliness, and the preservation of the ritual purity that Masah intends to maintain.\n\n3. **Consultation with Contemporary Scholars**: Given that this is a matter involving contemporary innovations and materials, the best course of action would be to consult with knowledgeable Maliki scholars who are familiar with both traditional jurisprudence and modern contexts. They can provide a more definitive and contextually relevant ruling.\n\n4. **Diversity of Opinions**: It's important to recognize that there may be diversity in opinions among Maliki scholars regarding such modern issues. Different scholars might reach different conclusions based on their understanding and interpretation of the primary sources and principles of Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nIn summary, for an issue like Masah over modern bamboo-lined socks, a Maliki response would likely depend on how closely these socks meet the traditional conditions set for leather socks and how contemporary Maliki scholars interpret these conditions in the context of modern materials and needs. Consulting with a reputable and knowledgeable Maliki scholar or a council of Islamic jurisprudence that addresses contemporary issues would be the most appropriate way to get a specific ruling.",

      "content": "As of my last update, the question of whether modern non-leather socks, like bamboo-lined socks, meet the criteria for performing Masah (wiping over them during ablution) is one that varies among contemporary scholars across all Islamic schools of thought, including the Maliki school. The permissibility of performing Masah over such socks is a topic of contemporary ijtihad (independent reasoning) and is subject to differing interpretations based on how scholars understand and apply classical fiqh principles to modern contexts.\n\n1. **Diverse Opinions**: Some modern scholars, including those in the Maliki school, may approve of performing Masah over these types of socks if they believe these socks meet the traditional criteria established for leather socks (khuffain), such as covering the entire foot including the ankle, being durable enough for extended wear without tearing, preventing water penetration, and staying up without needing to be tied.\n\n2. **Contextual and Practical Considerations**: Scholars who are open to accommodating modern materials and contexts might argue that the purpose behind the traditional rulings can be fulfilled by these modern socks. This could include considerations of practicality, maintaining ritual cleanliness, and the convenience for Muslims in different living conditions.\n\n3. **Conservative Views**: On the other hand, some Maliki scholars might adhere more strictly to traditional interpretations and may not approve of Masah over non-leather socks, sticking closely to the specific materials (like leather) mentioned in classical texts.\n\n4. **Individual Fatwas and Institutional Decisions**: In many cases, such rulings come from individual scholars issuing fatwas (legal opinions) or from Islamic jurisprudence councils that deliberate on contemporary issues. Their rulings might vary based on their methodology, understanding of the texts, and approach to contemporary issues.\n\n5. **Need for Direct Consultation**: To ascertain the position of modern Maliki scholars on this specific issue, it's advisable for Muslims interested in this matter to consult directly with reputable Maliki scholars or Islamic jurisprudence bodies that are known for addressing contemporary issues.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's possible that there are modern Maliki scholars who would approve of these socks for Masah, it's also likely that opinions vary. Personal consultation with knowledgeable Maliki authorities is the best way to obtain a clear and relevant ruling.",

      "content": "In the realm of contemporary Islamic scholarship, specific stances of individual scholars on issues like performing Masah over non-leather socks can vary, and these stances are often nuanced and context-dependent. However, I can outline the general trends among contemporary Maliki scholars regarding this issue:\n\n1. **Scholars for Masah Given the Right Conditions (Non-Leather Socks)**: Some contemporary Maliki scholars, especially those who focus on the principles and objectives (Maqasid) of Shariah, might be more open to the idea of performing Masah over non-leather socks. These scholars tend to emphasize the fulfillment of the functional criteria (such as durability, coverage, and impermeability) regardless of the material. Their reasoning might be grounded in the idea that the purpose behind the rulings on Masah over leather socks can also be achieved with modern materials that meet similar standards. However, naming specific scholars without referencing their published fatwas or statements would be speculative.\n\n2. **Scholars Insisting on Leather Socks**: Other Maliki scholars, particularly those with a more traditionalist approach, might insist that Masah is only permissible over leather socks (khuffain), adhering strictly to the precedent set by classical scholars and texts. These scholars typically emphasize the importance of sticking closely to the material and conditions explicitly mentioned in the Hadith and early Islamic jurisprudence. Again, without specific references to their rulings or published works, it would be inappropriate to name individual scholars in this category.\n\n3. **Differences in Rulings Across Regions and Institutions**: It's important to note that the stances of scholars can also vary based on regional and institutional affiliations. Some Islamic jurisprudence councils or fatwa bodies in different countries or regions might have issued collective rulings on this matter, reflecting a consensus or majority view among the scholars affiliated with them.\n\n4. **Need for Direct Reference**: For individuals seeking guidance on this issue, it's advisable to refer directly to the published works, official fatwas, or statements of contemporary Maliki scholars and Islamic jurisprudence councils. This approach ensures that the information is accurate, contextually relevant, and reflective of the scholars' actual views.\n\nIn summary, while I cannot name specific contemporary Maliki scholars and their positions on this issue without direct references to their works or statements, the trends in contemporary Maliki scholarship show a range of opinions, from those open to Masah over non-leather socks (under the right conditions) to those who adhere strictly to the traditional ruling of leather socks. Direct consultation with recognized Maliki scholars or reference to their published rulings is the best way to ascertain specific positions.",

      "content": "Yes, in Islamic jurisprudence, including the Maliki school, for socks to be valid for Masah (wiping over them during ablution), one of the key conditions is that they must cover the entire foot, including the ankles. This requirement is based on the principle that the socks should serve the same purpose as washing the feet, which includes washing up to and including the ankles as part of Wudu (ablution). Here are some specifics:\n\n1. **Coverage of the Ankle**: The socks must cover the entire area of the foot that would normally be washed during Wudu, and this includes the ankles. Socks that are shorter and do not cover the ankles do not meet the necessary criteria.\n\n2. **Durability and Fit**: Besides covering the ankles, the socks should also be durable and able to stay up on their own without needing to be tied. They should not have holes or be too thin.\n\n3. **Waterproof or Water-Resistant**: Ideally, for the Masah to be valid, the socks should be waterproof or at least water-resistant to the extent that they don't allow water to seep through easily during normal use.\n\nThese conditions ensure that the socks are serving as an adequate substitute for washing the feet in terms of coverage and protection. If these conditions are met, and the person had Wudu before putting on the socks, then Masah over these socks is permissible in place of washing the feet in subsequent Wudus for a specific period (one day and night for a resident and three days and nights for a traveler, in many traditional rulings).\n\nIt's important to note that Islamic jurisprudence is diverse, and interpretations can vary among scholars.
