It’ll be a short trip in Michigan, although I’d love to see you if at all possible. I have Jan 8th late afternoon/evening, Jan 9 all day, and Jan 10 morning and afternoon. If it doesn’t work this time, I’d love to get on a call someday. I’ve freed myself up from Bloom work since the Baby was born and have taken a much needed long break. Haha, I am beginning to get a bit antsy though and I’d love to share some of the opportunities I’ve been thinking about and to see if you have any others 🙂 \"",

I was hoping it may be available to high five me sometime between 10am and 1pm (2pm is pushing it yet possible).\nDawn Danby is available and we're thinking of meeting here:Projecto Diaz Coffee on Mandela/20th1416 20th St Oakland CA\n\nEric, I saw Channing Copper is nearby in the East Bay. If you want I could swing by the office if you're there :) - Also, if your office has a coffee maker, perhaps Dawn and I can swing by there and say hi. Don't want to interrupt too much, let me know what works.\nChristy, I'm not sure what your plan is, although if I'm in the East Bay I can easily get on some Lyfts and swing by to see all three of yall wherever you may be. \nMany hugs!BGPS, Sorry I can't bring a baby. This photo will have to suffice for now:",
