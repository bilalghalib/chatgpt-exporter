            "extracted_content": "So this is a curriculum outline that I'm supposed to work on and transform into a green curriculum. That is my job, I'm a consultant. And this is their outline, but also their summary of what they think is important to work on, what's not so important to work on. Can you review and then help me think about what we can do to chunk and categorize these clusters of what their recommendations are. Maybe we can categorize them as different types of recommendations and then cluster them and see what they suggest.\nChatGPT said:\nBased on the curriculum outline and the provided comments, we can categorize the recommendations into different types of green integration strategies. This will help in structuring the transformation into a green curriculum. Below is a suggested framework for categorizing and clustering the recommendations:\n\nGreen Curriculum Integration Framework\nGreen Market Awareness & Business Opportunities\n\nMarket Research: Introduce demand for green solutions and green business opportunities in Iraq (e.g., solar energy, water efficiency).\nBranding & Positioning: Highlight the value of being a green business, including potential advantages in customer attraction and investor interest.\nSales & Marketing Strategy: Position green business as a competitive advantage and explore niche green markets.\nInvestment & Financing Alternatives: Identify special funds or incentives for green businesses.\nSustainable Business Model & Operations\n\nBusiness Model Canvas (BMC): Integrate sustainability into the business model (e.g., circular economy, reducing waste).\nSupply Chain: Identify green procurement options, waste reduction strategies, and ethical sourcing practices.\nCost Model & Financial Planning: Evaluate the long-term financial impact of green investments (e.g., solar energy, sustainable materials).\nService Design: Extend product/service lifecycles, incorporate take-back programs, and encourage repairability.\nGreen Product & Service Design\n\nPrototyping: Consider material sustainability, energy consumption, and eco-friendly alternatives.\nUser Experience (UX) & Customer Journey Mapping: Identify sustainability touchpoints where customers interact with green practices.\nRevenue Model: Explore green monetization opportunities, including premium pricing for eco-friendly offerings.\nEnvironmental Impact & Risk Management\n\nBusiness Ethics & Triple Bottom Line (People, Planet, Profit): Evaluate environmental impact and social responsibility.\nRisk & Crisis Management: Identify sustainability-related risks and strategies for resilience (e.g., climate adaptation, resource scarcity).\nLegal & Policy Considerations: Research government policies and incentives supporting green businesses.\nCommunity & Leadership in Sustainability\n\nNetworking & Partnerships: Connect with sustainability entrepreneurs, organizations, and mentors.\nLeadership & Mindset: Foster eco-conscious leadership styles and decision-making.\nPersonal Branding & Communication: Emphasize sustainability as a core value in brand messaging.\nClustered Curriculum Adjustments\nNow, mapping these clusters onto the existing curriculum, here’s how we can refine the curriculum structure:\n\nCurriculum Section\tGreen Integration Focus\nMarket Research & Competitive Analysis\tIntroduce green market opportunities and sustainability trends.\nBranding & Value Proposition\tPosition green businesses as an attractive brand choice.\nPrototyping & Product Development\tConsider eco-friendly materials, lifecycle sustainability.\nBusiness Model & Revenue Streams\tIncorporate green business models and circular economy principles.\nCustomer Journey Mapping & UX\tIdentify sustainability touchpoints and customer perceptions of green products.\nFinance & Investment\tExplore funding and financial incentives for green businesses.\nRisk Management & Business Ethics\tIntegrate environmental risk considerations and responsible business practices.\nSupply Chain & Operations\tFocus on green procurement, ethical sourcing, and efficiency.\nSales & Marketing Strategy\tLeverage green branding for competitive advantage and customer engagement.\nLeadership, Networking & Personal Branding\tConnect with sustainability leaders, build green business networks.\nThis approach ensures a structured way to embed green elements across different learning modules while maintaining coherence with the original curriculum. Let me know if you’d like to refine any of these categories further!\n\n08:46\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nwcms_555274.pdf\nPDF\nOkay, so this is the ILO having some recommendations for green business training and climate resiliency. Can you review the clusters that they have and compare it to their recommendations? And maybe you can first start with some questions to help make the integration more clear. What I would like to do is actually end up with a sort of scoring rubric for each section that assesses its relevancy and how to align it with the green practices so that we can demonstrate to the funder that we've done our due diligence and we've actually looked into the research for best practices and that we looked at all of the curriculum and identified important intervention points and targeted the intervention points with some suggestions. So, review the ILO document and let's start asking questions and digging in to identify which sections might need to be updated and with what and how.\n08:47\nInitial Review & Questions for Integration\nThe ILO Green Business Booklet provides a structured framework for green business training and climate resiliency, covering:\n\nGreen Business Idea Generation\nBusiness Planning\nGreening Business Processes\nMarket & Financial Considerations\nEnvironmental Management Systems\nYour task is to integrate these recommendations into the existing curriculum while creating a scoring rubric that assesses alignment with green practices and intervention points. To start, let's identify key questions that will clarify what needs to be updated and how.\n\nKey Questions for Integration\nCurriculum Alignment with ILO’s Green Business Framework\n\nWhich sections of the existing curriculum already cover green business principles?\nWhich sections lack coverage of climate resilience and sustainability?\nAre there redundant sections that can be streamlined to avoid duplication?\nCategorizing the ILO Recommendations\n\nWhich recommendations focus on business model adjustments?\nWhich ones involve green operational practices (energy, waste, procurement, etc.)?\nAre there recommendations that are policy-focused (e.g., regulations, incentives)?\nDo any recommendations apply specifically to market positioning and branding?\nScoring & Assessment Criteria\n\nHow do we assess the current curriculum’s alignment with green principles?\nWhat scoring scale should be used (e.g., Low/Medium/High Relevance)?\nShould the rubric measure both inclusion and depth (e.g., mention vs. thorough coverage)?\nWhat are the intervention points where green practices should be incorporated?\nDemonstrating Due Diligence for Funders\n\nWhat research sources should be cited to validate green business recommendations?\nCan we include case studies or benchmarks from similar programs?\nShould we present a before-and-after comparison of the curriculum?\nNext Steps\nCluster the ILO recommendations under key intervention areas (business strategy, operations, marketing, policy, etc.).\nCompare these clusters to the existing curriculum outline.\nIdentify gaps and determine where updates are needed.\nDevelop a scoring rubric that evaluates the curriculum’s alignment with green practices.\nWould you like me to begin categorizing the ILO recommendations now and compare them to the existing curriculum?\n\n08:47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, let's categorize the ILO recommendations and compare them to the existing curriculum and compare them to the existing curriculum's recommendations for improvements, and then determine if we can set up like a beginning rubric for each element that we can ask questions about, right? Like we can ask various questions about each module in the training curriculum to see if it aligns with green and climate resilience practices. The issue is the client I'm working for does not want to make this curriculum a green sustainability curriculum. They want it to be a business curriculum that has the reality of the Iraqi entrepreneurship ecosystem's connection to its environment and to potential consequences of climate collapse and the challenges in terms of rising energy costs to be considered for every business. It's not just an example, but the idea is it's not a green curriculum. It's an entrepreneurship curriculum that's realistic given the world that we're living in today. And so I don't want this to seem like it's a green curriculum. I want this to be an entrepreneurship curriculum that is green by the nature of responding to the current climate of business today. And so maybe that could be one of the first things that we figure out. It's like, okay, so for the next 25 to 30 years, between five and 30 years, how could it be possible that the Iraqi ecosystem will be impacted by climate collapse and climate-related impacts for businesses? And what do we need to do to design businesses that are relevant for the times that we are in and we will soon be in? And it requires a little bit of knowledge of the future or expecting what the future might be like. So maybe we need to do that a little bit. And then also timelines for businesses, especially early stage businesses. They might make plans now, but if they're growing, five years is not that long in the life of a business. They can imagine that in five years, their prices and their suppliers and all these things might change. So maybe it doesn't even have to be a bunch of answers even as well. Maybe it's like, as things change, are you considering adaptation as we move along? And so being aware of the axes that things can and may change, and maybe even having a strategy for keeping an eye out on risk management and risk mitigation and how it impacts their business models, and regularly updating based on the current climate science and geopolitical considerations, something like that. Does that make sense?\n08:47\nChatGPT said:\nYes, that makes perfect sense. The key challenge here is to embed green and climate-aware practices within a standard entrepreneurship curriculum without making it appear like a \"green curriculum.\" Instead, it should reflect real-world business conditions in Iraq over the next 5–30 years, ensuring that entrepreneurs are future-proofing their businesses against climate-related and economic changes.\n\nStructured Approach\nFuture-Proofing Iraqi Businesses: Understanding the Next 5–30 Years\n\nIdentify likely climate and economic changes that will affect businesses.\nDefine adaptation strategies for businesses to remain competitive.\nFrame these not as sustainability mandates but as business necessities.\nILO Recommendations & Curriculum Comparison\n\nCluster ILO’s green business recommendations into key business functions.\nCompare them to the current curriculum recommendations.\nIdentify gaps and intervention points where climate-aware business strategies should be added.\nDeveloping an Adaptive Rubric\n\nDesign a scoring rubric that does not measure \"greenness\" but instead evaluates business resilience in changing environmental and economic conditions.\nCreate assessment questions for each module in the curriculum to ensure business strategies include risk management, adaptation, and future-thinking.\nStep 1: Mapping Climate & Economic Risks for Iraqi Entrepreneurs (5–30 Years)\nTo ensure we are embedding realistic risk mitigation strategies, let's forecast key climate and economic trends in Iraq:\n\nTimeframe\tExpected Climate & Business Impacts\tBusiness Considerations\nNext 5 Years\tRising energy costs, water scarcity, heatwaves, disrupted supply chains\tCost-effective energy strategies, supplier diversification, local material sourcing\n5–15 Years\tMore frequent extreme weather events, policy shifts on emissions, potential water rationing\tBusiness insurance for disruptions, flexible business models, water-efficient operations\n15–30 Years\tGeopolitical instability due to resource scarcity, changing consumer behaviors, potential green energy mandates\tLong-term risk planning, alternative markets, climate-conscious product/service offerings\nThis step ensures entrepreneurs do not just react but plan for these shifts.\n\nKey Curriculum Design Principle → Business resilience and adaptability should be baked into every module, not framed as an environmental initiative.\n\nStep 2: Categorizing ILO Recommendations & Comparing to Curriculum\nNow, let’s align ILO’s recommendations with core business principles and compare them to the existing curriculum's suggestions.\n\nILO Green Business Area\tBusiness-Relevant Framing (for Iraq)\tCurriculum Gaps/Intervention Points\nMarket & Consumer Demand\tFuture trends: rising energy/material costs will change pricing and consumer habits\tDo businesses assess their future market's resilience to climate-related changes?\nSupply Chain & Resource Access\tClimate disruptions may limit imports, increasing demand for local supply chains\tDoes the curriculum train entrepreneurs to evaluate supplier risks and future-proof procurement?\nOperations & Cost Management\tEfficiency = profitability (e.g., lower energy costs, adaptive pricing models)\tAre businesses considering cost-effective strategies for energy, water, and logistics?\nRisk & Crisis Management\tBusinesses that ignore climate risks may face supply disruptions, regulatory fines\tDo entrepreneurs have contingency plans for environmental and geopolitical shocks?\nInvestment & Finance\tAccess to green finance, potential for ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) funding\tDoes the curriculum introduce funding options that reward long-term resilience?\nLeadership & Adaptability\tEntrepreneurs must adapt to global shifts in consumer preferences and policy\tAre businesses being trained to monitor and adjust their strategies as global conditions evolve?\nStep 3: Building an Assessment Rubric\nInstead of measuring \"greenness,\" the rubric will assess business adaptability, risk awareness, and future-proofing capacity.\n\nProposed Rubric for Evaluating Business Resilience\nEach module in the curriculum should include questions that assess how well businesses are preparing for future risks. These questions can help guide business owners toward flexible, future-proof strategies.\n\nCategory\tAssessment Question\tScoring Criteria\nMarket Awareness\tHas the business identified how climate and economic shifts may affect demand?\t1 (No awareness) → 5 (Has future market analysis & adaptation plan)\nSupplier & Resource Strategy\tDoes the business have alternative suppliers in case of price surges or shortages?\t1 (No contingency plan) → 5 (Has mapped alternative suppliers & materials)\nCost & Operations\tHas the business assessed future energy/water costs and planned for efficiency?\t1 (No plan) → 5 (Energy & water efficiency embedded in financial strategy)\nRisk Mitigation\tDoes the business have an adaptive strategy to handle climate disruptions?\t1 (No risk assessment) → 5 (Regularly updates risk & mitigation plans)\nFinancial Strategy\tHas the business considered long-term investment sources tied to resilience?\t1 (No funding awareness) → 5 (Exploring ESG, resilience-linked financing)\nNext Steps\nValidate Future Business Challenges\n\nDo these projected climate and economic trends align with local expert opinions?\nAre there additional country-specific risks that should be considered?\nEmbed Future-Proofing into the Curriculum\n\nWhich existing modules can naturally incorporate resilience planning?\nWhere are the best intervention points for training entrepreneurs to assess and update their strategies?\nFinalize the Rubric & Questions\n\nEnsure assessment questions are practical and easy for entrepreneurs to apply.\nPilot the rubric with a small group of trainees to see if it effectively captures real-world adaptability.\nSummary of Approach\n✅ Not a green curriculum → An entrepreneurship curriculum that is climate-informed.\n✅ Future-proofing as a core business skill, not an environmental requirement.\n✅ Businesses assessed on adaptability, not sustainability.\n✅ Practical risk mitigation strategies instead of ideological \"green business\" framing.\n\nWould you like me to test this rubric against the current curriculum and refine the intervention points further?\n\n08:47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYes let’s test the rubric - what might we not be asking or thinking about that we need to consider\n08:51\nChatGPT said:\nI'll run an initial test of the rubric against the existing curriculum to identify gaps and areas for improvement. While doing this, I'll also highlight what we might be missing—blind spots in our approach that could affect how well the curriculum prepares entrepreneurs for the future.\n\nStep 1: Applying the Rubric to the Current Curriculum\nI'll systematically check each curriculum section against the rubric categories to identify where intervention is needed and whether the current content implicitly or explicitly covers resilience-focused business practices.\n\nI'll generate a comparison table that highlights:\n\nWhere the curriculum aligns with future-proofing best practices ✅\nWhere it lacks explicit integration of resilience principles ⚠️\nPotential interventions to ensure businesses are better prepared 🔧\nLet me process this now.\n\n08:52\n\nAnalyzed\npython\nAlways show details\n\nCopy\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Creating a comparison table between the current curriculum and the rubric assessment areas\ncurriculum_rubric_comparison = pd.DataFrame([\n    {\n        \"Curriculum Section\": \"Market Awareness & Business Strategy\",\n        \"Rubric Category\": \"Market Awareness\",\n        \"Current Coverage\": \"Covers basic market research but does not explicitly address long-term changes due to climate or economic shifts.\",\n        \"Intervention Needed\": \"Incorporate future market trend analysis, scenario planning, and risk identification for supply chain disruptions.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Curriculum Section\": \"Supply Chain & Procurement\",\n        \"Rubric Category\": \"Supplier & Resource Strategy\",\n        \"Current Coverage\": \"Discusses sourcing and supplier relationships but does not consider future disruptions due to climate risks or price fluctuations.\",\n        \"Intervention Needed\": \"Train entrepreneurs to assess supplier vulnerabilities, diversify procurement strategies, and explore local sustainable alternatives.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Curriculum Section\": \"Operations & Cost Management\",\n        \"Rubric Category\": \"Cost & Operations\",\n        \"Current Coverage\": \"Focuses on cost-cutting and efficiency but does not account for rising energy/water costs or carbon regulations.\",\n        \"Intervention Needed\": \"Introduce long-term operational efficiency planning, energy/water-saving practices, and adaptive business models.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Curriculum Section\": \"Risk & Crisis Management\",\n        \"Rubric Category\": \"Risk Mitigation\",\n        \"Current Coverage\": \"Limited to traditional business risks (e.g., financial, competitor-related) but lacks integration of climate-related risks.\",\n        \"Intervention Needed\": \"Expand risk management training to include climate, environmental, and geopolitical risks with periodic business model reviews.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Curriculum Section\": \"Finance & Investment\",\n        \"Rubric Category\": \"Financial Strategy\",\n        \"Current Coverage\": \"Covers traditional financing options but does not explore green financing, ESG funds, or adaptive investment strategies.\",\n        \"Intervention Needed\": \"Introduce knowledge of alternative funding sources, including green bonds, impact investing, and resilience-focused loans.\"\n    }\n])\n\n# Display the comparison table\nimport ace_tools as tools\ntools.display_dataframe_to_user(name=\"Curriculum Rubric Comparison\", dataframe=curriculum_rubric_comparison)\nResult\n                     Curriculum Section               Rubric Category  \\\n0  Market Awareness & Business Strategy              Market Awareness   \n1            Supply Chain & Procurement  Supplier & Resource Strategy   \n2          Operations & Cost Management             Cost & Operations   \n3              Risk & Crisis Management               Risk Mitigation   \n4                  Finance & Investment            Financial Strategy   \n\n                                    Current Coverage  \\\n0  Covers basic market research but does not expl...   \n1  Discusses sourcing and supplier relationships ...   \n2  Focuses on cost-cutting and efficiency but doe...   \n3  Limited to traditional business risks (e.g., f...   \n4  Covers traditional financing options but does ...   \n\n                                 Intervention Needed  \n0  Incorporate future market trend analysis, scen...  \n1  Train entrepreneurs to assess supplier vulnera...  \n2  Introduce long-term operational efficiency pla...  \n3  Expand risk management training to include cli...  \n4  Introduce knowledge of alternative funding sou...  \nCurriculum Rubric Comparison\n\n\nStep 2: Identifying Missing Considerations\nNow that we've mapped the rubric against the curriculum, let's consider what we might be missing—areas that aren't explicitly covered but are essential for business resilience in Iraq.\n\n1. Blind Spots in Future-Proofing\nPolicy & Regulation Uncertainty:\n\nIraq’s climate and energy policies are evolving. Businesses need to be aware of potential future regulations (e.g., carbon taxes, renewable energy incentives).\nIntervention: Introduce regulatory scenario planning—how could policy shifts impact business models in 5–10 years?\nShifts in Consumer Behavior & Preferences:\n\nConsumers (especially younger demographics) are becoming more climate-conscious.\nIntervention: Encourage businesses to track consumer trends and integrate flexibility into their branding and marketing.\nInfrastructure Resilience & Business Continuity:\n\nExtreme weather (heat waves, floods) could affect transportation, logistics, and supply chains.\nIntervention: Develop contingency plans for supply chain disruptions and urban infrastructure failures.\n2. Questions We Haven’t Asked (But Should)\nTo refine the rubric, we should ask:\n\nHow do we ensure entrepreneurs continue to monitor and adapt over time?\n\nPossible Solution: Introduce a business continuity review process every 6 months.\nAre we considering different industry types?\n\nSome businesses (e.g., agriculture, construction) are more affected by climate risks than others.\nPossible Solution: Industry-specific adaptation guidelines in the training.\nHow do we balance urgency vs. feasibility?\n\nNot all entrepreneurs can afford green upgrades immediately.\nPossible Solution: Teach a staged implementation strategy—small changes now, larger investments later.\nStep 3: Next Actions\nRefine the Rubric: Add missing dimensions (e.g., policy adaptation, consumer trends, infrastructure resilience).\nAdjust Curriculum Modules: Integrate recommendations from the rubric assessment.\nPilot a Small-Scale Test: Validate whether entrepreneurs find these future-proofing questions useful and practical.\nWould you like me to refine the rubric with these new insights, or focus on specific modules first? ​​\n\n08:52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nLet’s do 1 and 2 and then review our work. I want to create a recommendation document after my first onboarding meeting I want to show them a strategy for identifying what to improve and how and to offer the strategy that this isn’t a “green business” adaptation, this is a “good citizen” green response business training program, confronting the reality of what is to come and being appropriately prepared and considering the necessary elements in their business.

Introduction\nThis proposal outlines a strategy to integrate climate resilience practices into the existing Five One Labs Incubator Curriculum while maintaining its core entrepreneurial focus. The goal is not to create a \"green business\" program, but rather to ensure that businesses emerging from the incubator are resilient, competitive, and prepared for the evolving economic and environmental landscape of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region (KRI).\n\nThis approach aligns with global best practices while remaining locally relevant. It leverages the Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a framing tool to embed climate-aware business strategies without disrupting the curriculum’s structure.\n\n2. Approach: Building Climate-Resilient Entrepreneurs\nFraming Climate Resilience as Business Resilience\nInstead of presenting climate adaptation as an environmental initiative, we will position it as a necessary component of modern business strategy. Entrepreneurs will learn to:\n\nAnticipate shifts in market demand, supply chains, and consumer preferences due to rising energy costs and environmental factors.\nDevelop business models that remain viable in an increasingly resource-constrained world.\nIdentify funding and investment opportunities linked to sustainability, such as impact investing and climate adaptation grants.\nKey Principles of Integration\nEmbedded, Not Added\nClimate resilience is not a standalone topic—it is integrated into market research, financial planning, business model design, and operations.\nReal-World Examples\nCase studies will highlight businesses in Iraq, KRI, and internationally that have successfully adapted to climate challenges.\nFlexibility & Feasibility\nEntrepreneurs will be introduced to staged adaptation strategies, allowing them to implement small, cost-effective changes now, with a roadmap for scaling up over time.\nRisk Management as a Core Business Skill\nBusinesses will learn how to monitor environmental and economic risks and adjust their models accordingly.\n3. Curriculum Integration Strategy\nUsing the Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a Structuring Tool, we will integrate climate resilience considerations seamlessly into each session of the incubator program.\n\nBMC Component\tResilience Considerations\tCurriculum Adjustments\nKey Partners\tSupply chain resilience, alternative suppliers, local production options\tEntrepreneurs assess supplier risks and build contingency plans.\nKey Activities\tEnergy efficiency, waste reduction, adaptive business operations\tIntroduce lean operations training and cost-saving climate adaptations.\nValue Proposition\tCustomer demand for sustainability, brand differentiation\tTrain businesses to integrate resilience into their branding and marketing.\nCustomer Relationships\tLong-term engagement, shifting expectations\tBusinesses learn to track consumer preferences for sustainability.\nRevenue Streams\tClimate-linked investment, adaptive pricing strategies\tEntrepreneurs explore financing options like green bonds and ESG investment.\nKey Resources\tMaterial scarcity, future supply constraints\tGuide businesses in resource planning and securing alternative suppliers.\nChannels\tDisruptions in logistics, infrastructure risks\tIntroduce diversification strategies for distribution.\nCost Structure\tRising energy and material costs\tBusinesses learn phased adaptation strategies to manage expenses.\nCustomer Segments\tMarkets less vulnerable to climate shifts\tEntrepreneurs target resilient customer bases and diversify offerings.\n4. Key Deliverables\n4.1 Curriculum Review & Climate Integration Plan\nDetailed assessment of all 32 curriculum sessions to identify intervention points.\nA rubric-based evaluation that assesses whether each module adequately prepares entrepreneurs for future risks.\nA recommendation document outlining specific updates and additional learning materials.\n4.2 Practical Case Studies & Local Relevance\nCustomized case studies from Iraq, KRI, and the MENA region to illustrate climate-resilient business strategies.\nExamples of small-scale, cost-effective adaptations relevant to early-stage businesses.\n4.3 Training Materials & Language Accessibility\nTrainer Support Package with talking points, sources, visual aids, and supplementary reading.\nAll materials will be provided in English, Arabic, and Kurdish to ensure accessibility.\n5. Implementation Timeline\nPhase\tActivities\tTimeline\nWeek 1\tCurriculum review & rubric application\tJan 21 – Jan 28\nWeek 2\tIntegration of resilience strategies & case studies\tJan 29 – Feb 4\nWeek 3\tDevelopment of training materials & trainer support package\tFeb 5 – Feb 12\nWeek 4\tFinal review, localization, and delivery\tFeb 13 – Feb 25\n6. Additional Offerings (Annex)\nIf Five One Labs seeks further support, the following additional service packages are available:\n\nAdvanced Business Resilience Workshops (live or recorded) for entrepreneurs.\nPolicy & Regulatory Landscape Report analyzing potential climate-related business regulations in Iraq and KRI.\nCustomized Business Resilience Coaching for incubator participants.\n7. Conclusion: Future-Proofing Entrepreneurship in KRI\nThis strategy ensures that Five One Labs’ entrepreneurs are not only aware of climate risks but are also equipped to navigate them strategically. By embedding real-world resilience into business fundamentals, we align the incubator curriculum with economic realities and investor expectations while maintaining its entrepreneurial focus.\n\nThis approach positions Five One Labs as a leader in forward-thinking business education, equipping startups with the tools they need to thrive in a changing world.\n\nWould you like me to format this into a formal PDF document or include any additional details before submission?\n\n08:59\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nCan you make an additional table that takes what we learned from the ILO and the curriculum outline with comments they shared and then align it with the BMC and table of improvements you suggested above ?\n09:28\nChatGPT said:\n\nAnalyzed\npython\nAlways show details\n\nCopy\n# Creating a table that aligns the ILO recommendations, curriculum outline comments, and BMC-based improvements\nilo_bmc_alignment = pd.DataFrame([\n    {\n        \"ILO Recommendation\": \"Market awareness of green opportunities and risks\",\n        \"Curriculum Outline Comment\": \"Needs stronger connection to local challenges, market shifts, and external risks.\",\n        \"BMC Component\": \"Market Awareness (Customer Segments & Value Proposition)\",\n        \"Recommended Improvement\": \"Introduce future trend analysis, risk-based market research, and consumer demand shifts in the Iraqi and KRI context.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"ILO Recommendation\": \"Sustainable supply chain & procurement\",\n        \"Curriculum Outline Comment\": \"Little focus on long-term sourcing risks, no adaptation for climate-induced material costs.\",\n        \"BMC Component\": \"Key Resources & Key Partners\",\n        \"Recommended Improvement\": \"Train entrepreneurs to assess supply chain vulnerabilities, build alternative supplier networks, and explore sustainable sourcing strategies.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"ILO Recommendation\": \"Cost efficiency through energy & resource management\",\n        \"Curriculum Outline Comment\": \"Energy costs expected to rise, but no training on efficiency strategies.\",\n        \"BMC Component\": \"Cost Structure & Operations\",\n        \"Recommended Improvement\": \"Introduce staged energy efficiency adaptations, water conservation strategies, and lean operations to manage costs.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"ILO Recommendation\": \"Risk mitigation & climate adaptation\",\n        \"Curriculum Outline Comment\": \"Crisis planning focuses on financial risks but lacks environmental risk consideration.\",\n        \"BMC Component\": \"Risk Mitigation (Key Activities & Revenue Streams)\",\n        \"Recommended Improvement\": \"Expand risk assessment frameworks to include climate risks, geopolitical instability, and business continuity planning.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"ILO Recommendation\": \"Access to green finance and resilience-linked investment\",\n        \"Curriculum Outline Comment\": \"Financial strategy is limited to traditional funding options;

Can you go through the document and go through all of the content and material that we've shared so far and recommend a rubric that we can score each of the modules on that includes recommendations for what to do, right? So the rubric could say something like has X, Y, or Z factor, you know, in it and we can look and we can say yes it does or no it doesn't and so that the rubric is not just a scoring but it's also an indicator of how it can be improved. Does that make sense? So let's look at the entire document and all of the context that we have and the table and let's make a new table which has a rubric with a scoring sheet of, I don't know, somewhere between, you know, three and six elements. You decide what is needed and necessary and let's have this scoring rubric be a way of, you know, measuring every module. So it should be on the module list, so the total number of modules, and then it should have like a five elements, four to six elements of scoring and then a total score and then a suggestion for improvements for that module. So this is a way that we can look at all the different modules and the bullet points and say oh okay so we need a worksheet for this module because it's missing one or something.

Don’t make an artifact with code do it directly in the chat, here’s the whole list: Five One Labs Curriculum Outline\nJan 2025\nSome observations on potential incorporate of green elements (environment, climate\nchange)\nIn the below commenting, references are made to the ILO/SIYB ‘Green Business\nBooklet’ which includes tools and guidance for integrating green elements into\nbusiness development.\nFor additional, in-depth guidance, please also refer to the ‘Green Business Guide’,\nalso from the ILO, found here:\nOther links that can be useful:\nThe basics of sustainable customer journey mapping: A guide\n3 Green Initiatives In Iraq Tackling Climate Change – Iraqi Innovators\nComments on “greening” entry points\nPart I. Ignite Program (Pre-Incubator)\n1. Design thinking:\n● Program Overview\n● Design thinking process and plan\n2. User research:\n● User persona\n● Empathy map\n3. The survey:\n● Steps to creating a survey\n● Survey component\n● How to get respondents\n4. Market research:\n● Understand your market\n● Market analyses and market size\n● Competitive benchmarking\nUnderstanding markets could very well\ninvolve elements of the demand for green\nsolutions, some of which might even be\neconomically interesting! At least in the\nlonger run.\nHere you can introduce the concept of\nwhat a green business is and how it can\nsupport accessing “green” markets and\nenhance competitiveness (e.g. by\nincreasing resource efficiency, reducing\nvulnerability to climate change, etc.). .\nYou can also add more information about\ngreen markets in Iraq, e.g. on solar\nenergy, water efficiency systems, energy\nefficiency, etc. Or on changes in demand\nfor green products.\n(See p.7-9 ‘Green Business Booklet’)\n5. Reframe:\n● Analyze user research\n● Custom journey steps and map\n● Build your business\nDepending on how deep you want the\nintegration of climate/environment\naspects, you could here add the option of\nintegrating surveys/interviews to\nunderstand how climate change is\nimpacting users’ lives and how this\ninfluences their needs, behaviours and\nattitudes. Or also consider integrating\nquestions to understand how important\nsustainability and environmental\nconcerns are to users and how it\ninfluences their behaviour and attitudes\ntowards “green” products or services.\n6. Creativity and ideation:\n● Rapid brainstorming (what if?)\n● Idea filtration\n● Challenging assumption\nDepending on how structured the\nideation process is in this programme,\nsome examples of green business ideas\nmight be shared for inspiration? Or ideas\ncould be ‘filtered’ using some green\ncriteria.... See ‘Green Business Booklet’\npage 30 (annex 2) for examples of\n‘Innovative Green Business Ideas’.\nAnother idea could be to add a “thematic\nbrainstorming” focused on creative\nsolutions to the most pressing\nenvironmental challenges in Iraq. See\n(See p.12 ‘Green Business Booklet’)\n7. The pitch:\n● Storytelling\n● Know your audience\n● Pitch key points\n● Judging criteria\n8. Your brand:\n● Build a brand\n● New value proposition\n● Mission and values\ndefinitely a place to think in some green!\nBeing the green solution/brand (while not\nnecessarily the more expensive one)\nshould bring some potential for attracting\ncertain customer elements... At least it\ncould be considered, whether there’s a\nvalue add in a green brand\nPart II. Incubator Program\n1. Introduction, Recap & Goal Setting\n● Welcome & Introductions\n● Five One Labs & The Incubator\n● Ignite Recap & Goal Setting\n2. Intro to UX\n● Reflect on CJM and why it is important.\n● Map out the ideal customer journey or\n“happy path” for your business.\n● Identify areas of opportunity that we\nwill use when developing your business\nmodel.\nWhen mapping the customer journey,\ntouchpoints where sustainable practices\ncan be showcased and/or where\ncustomer satisfaction might drop due to\nsustainability-related issues can be\nincluded as part of the CJM exercise.\n3. BMC-Business Model Canvas\n● Understand the various parts of the\nBusiness Model Canvas (BMC).\n● Fill in the parts of your own business\nmodel.\n● Identify assumptions you are making\nabout your business model.\n4. Introduction to prototyping\n● Understand why prototyping is\nessential to product development.\n● Review the different types of\nprototypes to create a prototyping plan.\n● Create your first prototypes!\nHere is a place to consider some green\nelements? For ex, if a physical product (or\nwrapping/packaging etc) is part of the\nprototype, choice of material can be\nconsidered, as can energy consumption\netc.\nYou can also use as reference the\nGreening Checklist in p.25 ‘Green\nBusiness Booklet’ , and overall use as\nreference p. 21-26 in the booklet.\n5. Test and Iterate\n● Learn and apply the best practices to\ntest your prototype.\n● Test your prototypes and plan for the\nnext iterations.\n● Begin to iterate on your prototypes.\n6. Revenue Model\n● Understand and compare various\nrevenue models.\n● Make a plan to test your revenue\nmodel.\n● Begin to forecast possible revenues.\n7. UX Design Principles\n● Review good and bad UX design\nexamples.\n● Understand elements of great UX\ndesign that you can apply to your\nbusiness.\n● Apply key UX principles to your\nbusiness.\n8. Project Management\n● Understand what goes into managing a\nproject.\n● Introduce some tools that can support\nyou and your team as you develop your\nbusiness.\n● Break down your goals and create a\nsystem to meet them.\n9. Cost Model\n● Break down the different types of\nbusiness costs.\n● Forecast ongoing business costs.\n● Build out the next step of your P&L\nstatement.\n10. Balance Sheet\n● Include your start-up budget in your\nfinances.\n● Get to know the balance sheet and\nbegin making one.\n● Understand how finances change with\ninvestments or loans.\n11.

Also, should this rubric be included in the final recommendation document or as a separate assessment tool?\n\n09:55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat are 3 other sets of 4-6 rubric elements that make sense to compare the curriculum with to help us achieve our green and climate smart entrepreneurial training program ?\n09:57\nChatGPT said:\nTo enhance the evaluation of the curriculum and ensure it effectively integrates green and climate-smart entrepreneurship training, here are three additional rubric frameworks that would complement the current assessment:\n\n1. Resilient & Future-Proof Business Development\n(Focus: Adaptability to climate, economic, and technological changes over time)\n\nRubric Element\tDescription\nBusiness Model Resilience\tDoes the curriculum teach businesses how to adapt to shifting markets, regulations, and economic trends?\nRisk Management & Scenario Planning\tAre students trained to forecast disruptions (climate, supply chain, regulatory) and prepare strategies for long-term survival?\nLong-Term Financial Viability\tDoes the program introduce financial planning strategies that consider increasing resource costs and future adaptation investments?\nCircular Economy & Sustainable Operations\tAre sustainable practices (recycling, reuse, waste reduction, energy efficiency) embedded in business operations?\nTechnology & Innovation for Sustainability\tDoes the curriculum introduce digital, AI, or green tech solutions that enhance long-term business resilience?\n✅ Use Case: This rubric helps identify weak points in long-term business adaptability and ensures climate adaptation is embedded in financial and operational planning.\n\n2. Ethical & Impact-Oriented Business Strategy\n(Focus: How businesses contribute to a positive social and environmental impact)\n\nRubric Element\tDescription\nSustainability as a Value Proposition\tDoes the curriculum encourage businesses to position sustainability as a market advantage?\nStakeholder & Community Engagement\tAre entrepreneurs trained to work with communities, customers, and suppliers for sustainable impact?\nMeasuring Social & Environmental Impact\tDoes the program teach businesses to track and report their environmental and social contributions?\nTriple Bottom Line Thinking\tAre businesses encouraged to balance people, planet, and profit in their decision-making?\nGreen Business Ethics & Avoiding Greenwashing\tDoes the curriculum educate on ethical marketing, sustainability reporting, and avoiding misleading claims?\n✅ Use Case: This rubric ensures sustainability is not just a cost-saving tool but a core part of the business’s identity, helping attract customers, investors, and partners who value impact.\n\n3. Green Entrepreneurship & Market Innovation\n(Focus: Whether entrepreneurs are equipped to identify and seize climate-related business opportunities)\n\nRubric Element\tDescription\nUnderstanding Green Markets & Consumer Trends\tDoes the curriculum teach entrepreneurs about demand for eco-friendly products/services and market shifts?\nAccess to Green Investment & Incentives\tAre students introduced to climate-smart financing, impact investors, and government grants?\nProduct/Service Design for Sustainability\tAre sustainable materials, packaging, and lifecycle considerations embedded in business design?\nScalability & Climate Smart Business Growth\tDoes the curriculum teach how to grow a business while maintaining environmental responsibility?\nCollaboration with Sustainability Networks\tAre entrepreneurs encouraged to join sustainability networks and partner with green businesses?\n✅ Use Case: This rubric identifies how well the program prepares entrepreneurs to capitalize on sustainability-driven market trends and green financing opportunities.\n\nHow These Complement the Original Rubric\nThe original rubric focuses on adaptation and resilience (market shifts, risk mitigation, supply chain, cost, policy).\nThese three additional rubrics help expand the scope by addressing:\nFuture-proofing businesses for climate and economic shifts.\nEthical, impact-driven entrepreneurship with sustainability as a strategic advantage.\nLeveraging green business trends for innovation and competitive positioning.\nWould you like me to apply these rubrics to the curriculum, or would you prefer to refine and prioritize which elements are most important before assessment?\n\n09:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, let's work to bring in business model resilience, risk management and scenario planning, circular economy, technology for sustainability, sustainability as a value proposition, triple bottom line thinking potentially, I'm not sure, measuring social environmental impacts, but how do we make sure that it doesn't seem like an extra thing, stakeholder and community engagement, understanding green markets and consumer trends, access to green investment and incentives, product service design for sustainability, but why should they do that? That is just a good for business kind of recommendation, scalability and climate smart business growth. Yeah, what's a way of taking all of these and unifying them, collaboration with sustainability networks, I kind of like all of them, and the initial ones, and maybe we can just find a way of finding the minimum maximum number that we can assess against for our curriculum development that aligns with the ILO's recommendations.\n09:58\nChatGPT said:\nTo unify all these rubric elements and ensure they seamlessly integrate into business training, we need a coherent framework that feels necessary rather than an “extra thing.” The key is positioning sustainability as a competitive advantage, not an obligation.\n\nFramework for a Unified Green & Resilient Business Training Rubric\nThis will integrate:\n\nBusiness Viability & Resilience – Ensuring businesses can thrive in changing market conditions.\nSustainable Business Strategy – Embedding sustainability into value creation, branding, and financial models.\nOperational & Financial Adaptation – Future-proofing businesses through smarter supply chains, technology, and financial resilience.\nMarket Positioning & Growth – Helping businesses leverage sustainability to attract investment, customers, and scale efficiently.\nFinal Set of Rubric Elements for Curriculum Evaluation\n(Aligned with ILO Recommendations & Green Business Best Practices)\n\nRubric Element\tWhy It Matters for Entrepreneurs\tHow It Aligns with ILO & Market Trends\nBusiness Model Resilience\tHelps businesses withstand market shifts, climate events, and resource constraints.\tThe ILO emphasizes business continuity planning and economic adaptability.\nRisk Management & Scenario Planning\tEnsures businesses prepare for supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, and economic shocks.\tAligns with the ILO’s emphasis on resilience-building tools.\nCircular Economy & Sustainable Operations\tReduces costs by minimizing waste, increasing efficiency, and reusing resources.\tILO promotes resource efficiency as an economic advantage.\nTechnology & Innovation for Sustainability\tProvides solutions to improve efficiency, lower costs, and future-proof businesses.\tClimate-smart business growth includes innovation in materials, energy, and digital solutions.\nSustainability as a Value Proposition\tDifferentiates businesses by making sustainability a competitive advantage, not a burden.\tILO encourages businesses to tap into green markets and consumer demand shifts.\nTriple Bottom Line Thinking (People, Planet, Profit)\tEncourages businesses to consider long-term profitability and brand reputation.\tIncreasingly relevant for investors, customers, and regulatory frameworks.\nMeasuring Social & Environmental Impact\tProvides credibility and transparency, which helps secure funding and partnerships.\tInvestors and consumers demand proof of impact.\nStakeholder & Community Engagement\tBuilds brand trust, secures partnerships, and increases business legitimacy.\tILO emphasizes stakeholder-driven entrepreneurship.\nUnderstanding Green Markets & Consumer Trends\tHelps businesses identify profitable green market opportunities and shifting consumer preferences.\tMarket research should incorporate sustainability-related trends.\nAccess to Green Investment & Incentives\tUnlocks financing opportunities through ESG funds, government grants, and impact investing.\tILO encourages leveraging financial tools for sustainability.\nProduct & Service Design for Sustainability\tEnsures businesses stay competitive by future-proofing their offerings.\tThe ILO emphasizes product lifecycle sustainability and consumer expectations.\nScalability & Climate-Smart Business Growth\tHelps businesses grow in a way that avoids future risks and maximizes long-term stability.\tA key focus of ILO’s green business strategy.\nCollaboration with Sustainability Networks\tExpands opportunities for learning, partnerships, and funding.\tTies into ILO’s promotion of peer-to-peer learning and ecosystem-building.\nHow to Apply This Rubric to the Curriculum\nAssess Each Module – Apply these 13 elements as a lens to evaluate if a module supports business resilience, sustainability, and competitiveness.\nSet a Minimum & Maximum Score – Instead of rating each module on all 13, pick 5-7 key elements per module that are most relevant.\nEmbed Rather than Add – Identify which modules can naturally incorporate sustainability elements without disrupting their core business focus.\nExample: Market Research → Include trends on green consumer behavior, not a separate “green market” lecture.\nExample: Supply Chain → Introduce supplier risk assessment that includes climate impacts, rather than a separate “sustainable sourcing” topic.\nMinimum & Maximum Approach for Curriculum Development\nMinimum:\n\nEvery module should include at least 3 elements from the rubric.\nThis ensures baseline integration without overwhelming the program.\nMaximum:\n\nNo module should be expected to cover more than 6 elements at a time.\nThis keeps sustainability practical, embedded, and natural, rather than feeling like an add-on.\n✅ This approach ensures that sustainability is an essential business competency, not an optional niche topic.\n\nWould you like me to apply this rubric to the curriculum modules now, selecting the most relevant 3-6 elements per module?\n\n09:58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOkay, yeah, could you figure out the most relevant 3 to 6 elements per module to rate them and maybe make a table of all the different rubric elements and explain how they're just good for business and not necessarily good for only green businesses and and how it's important for Iraq and then let's yeah review each module and pick the

ensuring practical integration rather than adding sustainability as an extra burden.\n\n✅ Key Takeaways:\n\nEach module naturally embeds sustainability into core business training.\nSome modules (e.g., Marketing, Branding, UX) benefit from green consumer trends & positioning.\nOthers (e.g., Cost Model, Supply Chain, Risk Management) emphasize resilience, efficiency, and scenario planning.\nAccess to Green Investment & Incentives is crucial for finance-related modules.\nProduct & Service Design for Sustainability is highly relevant for prototyping, testing, and customer-focused modules.\nWould you like to apply a scoring system to these elements for each module to track integration levels, or do you prefer a qualitative review first before finalizing the assessment? ​​\n\n10:09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nJRC128040_001.pdf\nPDF\nLet’s align our tables and ensure we’re also addressing the EU’s green comp \n10:10\nAlignment of GreenComp with the Curriculum Rubric\nGreenComp, the European sustainability competence framework, consists of four competence areas and 12 sustainability competences that can be integrated into the curriculum. The goal is to embed sustainability seamlessly into entrepreneurship education, showing how sustainability-related competencies contribute to business resilience, innovation, and long-term success, rather than appearing as an \"extra\" burden.\n\nHere are the four GreenComp areas and how they can be relevant:\n\nEmbodying Sustainability Values\n\nValuing sustainability (Integrating sustainability into decision-making)\nSupporting fairness (Ensuring equity and justice)\nPromoting nature (Acknowledging human dependence on nature)\nEmbracing Complexity in Sustainability\n\nSystems thinking (Understanding interconnections between economic, environmental, and social factors)\nCritical thinking (Challenging business norms to incorporate sustainable solutions)\nProblem framing (Defining challenges in a sustainability context)\nEnvisioning Sustainable Futures\n\nFutures literacy (Developing scenarios for green and climate-smart businesses)\nAdaptability (Managing risks related to environmental and market changes)\nExploratory thinking (Using creativity and innovation for sustainable solutions)\nActing for Sustainability\n\nPolitical agency (Understanding sustainability policies and incentives)\nCollective action (Collaborating with communities and stakeholders)\nIndividual initiative (Taking responsibility for sustainable entrepreneurship)\nRubric for Evaluating Curriculum Modules\nTo ensure that the curriculum effectively integrates GreenComp, business resilience, and climate-smart entrepreneurship, we propose a rubric with six key elements. Each module can be assessed on a scale from 1 to 5, where:\n\n1 = Not Addressed\n2 = Minimal Consideration\n3 = Basic Integration\n4 = Strong Integration\n5 = Fully Embedded\nRubric Element\tExplanation\nBusiness Model Resilience\tDoes the module help entrepreneurs build a resilient business that can adapt to environmental, market, and social disruptions?\nCircular Economy & Sustainability\tDoes it introduce principles of resource efficiency, waste reduction, and regenerative business models?\nGreen Market & Consumer Trends\tDoes it explore the demand for sustainable products and services, as well as strategies to tap into these markets?\nRisk & Scenario Planning\tDoes it train entrepreneurs to anticipate environmental risks (e.g., climate change) and plan for long-term sustainability?\nTechnology for Sustainability\tDoes it integrate tools, digital solutions, or emerging technologies that can improve environmental and operational efficiency?\nStakeholder & Community Engagement\tDoes it address how businesses can engage with local communities, policymakers, and sustainability networks for shared value?\nAligning the Rubric with Each Module\nEach module in the Five One Labs Curriculum will be rated using the rubric above, ensuring that sustainability is woven into the core business training rather than appearing as an add-on.\n\nFor example:\n\nModule\tBusiness Resilience\tCircular Economy\tGreen Market Trends\tRisk Planning\tTech for Sustainability\tCommunity Engagement\tTotal Score\tImprovement Suggestions\nDesign Thinking\t4\t3\t2\t3\t2\t3\t17/30\tAdd examples of sustainable design solutions.\nMarket Research\t3\t2\t4\t3\t2\t4\t18/30\tInclude analysis of green consumer preferences in Iraq.\nPrototyping\t3\t4\t2\t3\t5\t2\t19/30\tEncourage materials and production sustainability considerations.\nRevenue Model\t4\t2\t3\t4\t3\t3\t19/30\tConsider sustainable finance models and incentives.\nSupply Chain\t5\t5\t4\t5\t3\t5\t27/30\tStrong module, ensure green supplier selection.\nEach module will receive a total score out of 30, and improvement suggestions will be provided for better integration of sustainability.\n\nWhy This Rubric is Good for Business (Not Just Green Businesses)\nBusiness Resilience: Companies that incorporate sustainability are less vulnerable to market shocks, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory risks.\nCircular Economy: Businesses that reduce waste and reuse materials often cut costs and increase profitability.\nGreen Market Trends: Consumer demand for sustainable products is growing globally, and early adopters gain competitive advantage.\nRisk & Scenario Planning: Preparing for climate change and resource constraints ensures business longevity.\nTechnology for Sustainability: Using digital tools and renewable energy increases efficiency and lowers costs.\nStakeholder Engagement: Businesses with strong community ties and sustainability branding attract customers, investors, and policymakers.\nThis rubric ensures that every module in the curriculum prepares entrepreneurs to thrive in a changing business landscape while embedding sustainability seamlessly into core business training.\n\nWould you like to refine the rubric further or adjust how we assess certain modules?\n\n10:10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\nYes refine it further.

Using the GreenComp-aligned rubric, we can assess how well the session prepares entrepreneurs for resilient, sustainable, and climate-smart business development.\n\nRubric Assessment of the BMC Session\nRubric Element\tAssessment of Current BMC Session\tSuggested Improvements\nBusiness Model Resilience\tThe session teaches the BMC framework but does not explicitly help entrepreneurs consider long-term business resilience to economic, environmental, or regulatory shifts.\tIntroduce a resilience check for each section of the BMC. Ask: What risks (climate, supply chain, regulation) could disrupt this model in 5-10 years?\nCircular Economy & Sustainable Operations\tThere is no discussion of how circular economy principles (e.g., waste reduction, resource efficiency) fit into business models.\tAdd an activity on incorporating sustainable operations into the Key Activities, Key Partners, and Cost Structure sections of the BMC.\nGreen Market & Consumer Trends\tThe session does not explore how sustainability impacts customer demand, even though green markets are growing in Iraq.\tIn the Customer Segments section, introduce eco-conscious consumer behaviors and green market trends in Iraq.\nRisk & Scenario Planning\tEntrepreneurs identify assumptions, but they do not assess long-term risks related to climate, energy, or geopolitical factors.\tDuring the Assumption Mapping section, introduce climate-related risks and regulatory uncertainty as key assumptions to test.\nTechnology for Sustainability\tThe session does not introduce how technology can improve sustainability and business efficiency.\tEncourage participants to consider digital tools, renewable energy, or resource-efficient processes in the Key Resources and Cost Structure sections.\nStakeholder & Community Engagement\tThe session does not explore how businesses can partner with sustainability-focused organizations or government incentives.\tAdd a discussion on stakeholder engagement in sustainability when covering Key Partnerships in the BMC.\nRevised BMC Session with Sustainability & Resilience Enhancements\nThis revised session agenda ensures sustainability and resilience are naturally embedded in each step without making it seem like an extra burden.\n\n1️⃣ GO OVER BMC AND DO AN EXAMPLE (1 hour 5 mins)\nCurrent: Introduce the BMC, go over an example, and discuss key sections.\nImprovement:\n✅ Add real-world examples of sustainable business models, such as green startups in Iraq.\n✅ Ask: How do resilient businesses adapt to market shifts, supply chain disruptions, and climate change?\n2️⃣ APPLY BMC (40 mins)\nCurrent: Entrepreneurs fill in their own BMC.\nImprovement:\n✅ Add a \"Resilience Check\" after filling in each section:\nHow will this business survive climate risks, rising energy costs, or regulatory changes?\n✅ Encourage participants to highlight \"green\" opportunities in their revenue model and key resources.\n3️⃣ ASSUMPTION MAPPING (30 mins)\nCurrent: Identify risky assumptions in the business model.\nImprovement:\n✅ Expand \"Risky Assumptions\" to include:\nClimate risk (e.g., water shortages affecting product availability)\nSupply chain risk (e.g., reliance on imported goods)\nPolicy risk (e.g., future carbon regulations)\n✅ Use a sustainability-focused example when discussing \"the weakest part of the chain.\"\n4️⃣ CLOSE & ASSIGNMENT (5 mins)\nCurrent: Assign tasks, answer questions.\nImprovement:\n✅ Include a challenge to test sustainable strategies in their business model:\n\"What is one way you can make your business model more resilient or efficient?\"\n✅ Provide resources on green markets and funding opportunities in Iraq.\nFinal Takeaways\n✅ Small changes to the BMC session ensure sustainability is practical, not an \"extra\" concept.\n✅ Entrepreneurs will identify risks and opportunities that improve their business resilience.\n✅ The session remains interactive and relevant while naturally integrating climate-smart principles.\n\nWould you like an adjusted slide deck outline to reflect these improvements, or should we focus on refining

            "extracted_content": "Proposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\nSubmitted by: Bilal Ghalib\nTo: Five One Labs\nDate: 06 February 2025\n\n1. Introduction\nThis proposal outlines a strategy to integrate climate resilience practices into the existing Five One Labs Incubator Curriculum while maintaining its core entrepreneurial focus. The goal is not to create a \"green business\" program but rather to ensure that businesses emerging from the incubator are resilient, competitive, and prepared for the evolving economic and environmental landscape of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region (KRI).\nThis approach aligns with global best practices while remaining locally relevant. It leverages the Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a framing tool to embed climate-aware business strategies without disrupting the curriculum’s structure.\n\n2. Approach: Building Climate-Resilient Entrepreneurs\nFraming Climate Resilience as Business Resilience\nInstead of presenting climate adaptation as an environmental initiative, we will position it as a necessary component of modern business strategy.\nThis may require an additional section in the curriculum supporting this realization and opening the connection between climate and successful business strategy. Entrepreneurs will learn to:\nAnticipate shifts in market demand, supply chains, and consumer preferences due to rising energy costs and environmental factors.\nDevelop business models that remain viable in an increasingly resource-constrained world.\nIdentify funding and investment opportunities linked to sustainability, such as impact investing and climate adaptation grants.\n\n\n\nKey Principles of Integration\nEmbedded, Not Added\nClimate resilience is not a standalone topic—it is integrated into market research, financial planning, business model design, and operations.\nReal-World Examples\nCase studies will highlight businesses in Iraq, KRI, and internationally that have successfully adapted to climate challenges.\nFlexibility & Feasibility\nEntrepreneurs will be introduced to staged adaptation strategies, allowing them to implement small, cost-effective changes now, with a roadmap for scaling up over time.\nRisk Management as a Core Business Skill\nBusinesses will learn how to monitor environmental and economic risks and adjust their models accordingly.\n\n3.

Resilience in Incubator Curriculum vs. Green School Quality Standard: Greening Every Learning Environment\nLink: here\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen School Quality Standard Recommendations\nProposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\nAlignment & Improvement Suggestions\nDevelop a Green School Action Plan\n(Clear steps, responsibilities, and monitoring for sustainability initiatives)\n- The proposal outlines a structured Implementation Timeline for integrating climate resilience into the incubator curriculum.\n- The Curriculum Integration Strategy identifies specific intervention points in the Business Model Canvas (BMC).\n✅ Partial Alignment – The proposal includes structured phases, but it lacks explicit monitoring and evaluation plans to track progress.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce a progress tracking mechanism (e.g., feedback loops, sustainability progress dashboard for businesses).\nMonitor and Evaluate Progress\n(SMART targets, periodic evaluations, and avoiding greenwashing)\n- The proposal includes rubric-based evaluations for assessing resilience in the curriculum.\n- Key Deliverables mention an assessment of 32 curriculum sessions for improvement.\n✅ Alignment with improvement potential – The proposal addresses evaluation, but it doesn’t mention specific key performance indicators (KPIs) or methods for tracking business adaptation over time.\n➡ Recommendation: Develop clear KPIs such as:\n- % of businesses implementing climate resilience strategies\n- Success rates in securing climate-linked investments\n- Reduction in operational costs through energy efficiency\nFoster Community Engagement\n(Sharing sustainability best practices with the broader community)\n- The proposal includes case studies showcasing climate-resilient businesses in Iraq and internationally.\n- Additional services include business resilience coaching and policy & regulatory reports.\n✅ Good Alignment – The proposal focuses on community learning through real-world case studies.\n➡ Recommendation: Encourage peer learning and networking among entrepreneurs through sustainability forums, mentorship programs, or incubator alumni engagement.\nImprove Facilities and Operations\n(Water conservation, waste management, and infrastructure improvements for climate resilience)\n- The proposal focuses on business operations (lean operations, energy efficiency, sustainable supply chains).\n✅ Alignment in a business context – While the proposal integrates climate-conscious business operations, it doesn’t explicitly address waste management or water conservation.\n➡ Recommendation: Include training modules on circular economy principles and green infrastructure for businesses.\nEnhance Teaching and Learning\n(Integrate sustainability across subjects, participatory learning, hands-on projects)\n- Climate resilience is embedded across business modules, not treated as an isolated topic.\n- Uses Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a practical tool for integration.\n✅ Strong Alignment – The curriculum ensures climate resilience is a core business skill.\n➡ Enhancement: Incorporate experiential learning, such as business simulations, hands-on resilience-building exercises, and real-time problem-solving workshops.\nStrengthen Policy and Stakeholder Engagement\n(Stakeholder workshops, engagement with indigenous knowledge, advocacy training)\n- The proposal includes a Policy & Regulatory Landscape Report to guide entrepreneurs on compliance and future climate policies.\n✅ Good Alignment – Addresses policy adaptation but lacks a community advocacy component.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce policy roundtables or stakeholder dialogues for entrepreneurs to actively engage in policy discussions on climate resilience.\nAddress Climate Resilience and Disaster Preparedness\n(Emergency planning, climate risk reduction strategies)\n- The proposal integrates risk management as a business skill, helping businesses anticipate and mitigate climate risks.\n✅ Strong Alignment – The curriculum tackles climate risks through business continuity planning.\n➡ Enhancement: Add disaster preparedness training (e.g., what to do in case of climate-induced supply chain disruptions or extreme weather events).\n\n\n\n\nAnnex 2:\nClimate Resilience in Incubator Curriculum vs. GreenComp: The European Sustainability Competence Framework\nLink: here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenComp Competence Area\nProposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\nAlignment & Improvement Suggestions\nEmbodying Sustainability Values (Understanding ecological limits, fairness, and justice in sustainability)\n- Focuses on financial risk, supply chain adaptation, and business continuity.\n- Sustainability is framed as a business strategy, but ethical and social justice aspects are not emphasized.\n✅ Partial Alignment – The proposal integrates sustainability but does not explicitly address fairness and social justice in business models.\n➡ Recommendation: Expand on ethical decision-making and incorporate regenerative business models that prioritize fair trade, equity, and community impact.\nEmbracing Complexity in Sustainability (Systems thinking and understanding interdependencies)\n- Uses the Business Model Canvas (BMC) to integrate climate risks.\n- Focuses on business resilience but lacks a holistic understanding of sustainability interdependencies.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Addresses financial and operational resilience but does not fully incorporate systems thinking.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce training on interdependencies such as energy-water-food nexus, biodiversity impact, and circular economy strategies to help entrepreneurs see sustainability beyond business profits.\nFutures Literacy (Anticipating long-term sustainability risks and trends)\n- Encourages adaptation to market shifts but does not focus on future scenario planning.\n- Entrepreneurs are trained to react to changes rather than anticipate and shape the future.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Covers current risks but does not include foresight training for long-term climate resilience.\n➡ Recommendation: Implement scenario planning workshops where entrepreneurs map future sustainability trends, risks, and emerging green markets.\nAdaptability, Flexibility & Trade-offs (Navigating uncertainty and managing sustainability trade-offs)\n- Introduces staged adaptation strategies for businesses.\n- Focuses on short-term financial resilience rather than navigating long-term sustainability trade-offs.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Lacks structured decision-making for economic vs. environmental trade-offs.\n➡ Recommendation: Develop decision-making tools that help entrepreneurs balance profitability, sustainability, and resource constraints in uncertain conditions.\nExploratory Thinking (Innovating for sustainability, creating new solutions)\n- Uses case studies but lacks structured experimentation and innovation tools.\n- Encourages adapting to climate risks rather than leading innovation in sustainability.\n🔴 Needs Improvement – Does not integrate sustainability-driven business innovation.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce design thinking exercises, rapid prototyping, and sustainability innovation labs to encourage new green business models.\nCollective Action (Engaging stakeholders and working collaboratively for sustainability)\n- Businesses assess risks independently but lack structured collaboration mechanisms for sustainability.\n- No mention of peer learning, cooperative green initiatives, or public-private sustainability partnerships.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Lacks collaborative sustainability efforts.\n➡ Recommendation: Develop entrepreneurial peer learning networks, partnership-building exercises, and shared sustainability projects to scale collective impact.\nPolitical Agency (Understanding sustainability policies and regulations)\n- Covers ESG finance and climate-linked investment but lacks engagement with sustainability policy advocacy.\n- Entrepreneurs are trained to comply with existing policies but not to shape or influence them.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Addresses compliance but not advocacy.\n➡ Recommendation: Equip entrepreneurs with policy awareness training, climate policy advocacy strategies, and methods for engaging in sustainability governance.\nSustainable Business Practices & Innovation (Embedding sustainability in business models, finance, and value creation)\n- Focuses on risk management, energy efficiency, and green finance.\n- Lacks regenerative and circular economy business strategies.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Covers risk reduction but does not emphasize creating sustainability-driven business value.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce circular economy principles, regenerative business models, and impact measurement tools to help businesses become sustainability leaders, not just risk managers.\n\n\n"
