Edwards Deming*  \n   → Perhaps the most famous quote about systems doing exactly what they were built to do, whether intentional or flawed.\n\n---\n\n### 🔁 Broader Interpretations (Spiritual, Natural, Philosophical):\n\n6. **\"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.\"** – *Lao Tzu*  \n   → A kind of natural system executing its purpose effortlessly.\n\n7. **\"God does not play dice with the universe.\"** – *Albert Einstein*  \n   → Suggests order and design in systems, even if we don’t fully grasp them.\n\n8. **\"Everything in the universe has a purpose. Indeed, the invisible intelligence that flows through everything in a purposeful fashion is also flowing through you.\"** – *Wayne Dyer*\n\n9. **\"To each is a goal he was created to fulfill.\"** – *Islamic tafsir interpretation of Qur'an 20:50*  \n   → Everything is designed with a function and fulfills it naturally.\n\n---\n\nWould you like versions of these tailored for software, spirituality, nature, or engineering?",
