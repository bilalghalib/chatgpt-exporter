Here's our approach:\nPlan:\n\nWrite each section fully using all available content\nAfter each section, ask 3 targeted questions for the next section\nUse your answers to build subsequent sections\nIncorporate diagrams where helpful\nMaintain depth while ensuring readability\n\nStarting with Part I - Personal Journey: The Two Eyes\nFrom Metrics to Meaning: A New Vision for Social Impact\nPart I: Journey to Seeing with Both Eyes\nThe story of how I came to question our approach to social impact began in Dubai, watching entrepreneurs share their stories during our retreat. As tears flowed and hearts opened, I witnessed something our carefully designed metrics could never capture: the pure beauty of people fully aligned with their calling. In that moment, I realized we had been operating with one eye closed.\nThe Blindness of Single Vision\nLike many in social impact, I had internalized a worldview that prioritized measurement over meaning. We created dashboards, tracked KPIs, designed frameworks - all valuable tools, but ones that had somehow become primary rather than supportive. It was like navigating solely by map without looking at the territory, or trying to understand music purely through its sheet music without ever hearing it played.\nThis manifested most clearly in our platform metrics push. We needed data to improve, so we pushed entrepreneurs to engage online, even when it felt forced. Our metrics demanded it, but something deeper - a faculty I hadn't yet learned to trust - signaled this wasn't right.\nBreaking Through\nThe breakthrough came from recognizing that this sense wasn't just emotion or intuition - it was a legitimate perceptual faculty, as real as sight or hearing. This faculty lets us recognize quality directly, without needing to measure or analyze. It's what lets a master craftsperson know when something is right, what enables a teacher to recognize genuine understanding, what allows a community to sense authentic leadership.\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Single Vision: Metrics] -->|Leads to| B[Forced Outcomes]\n    C[Double Vision: Metrics + Quality] -->|Enables| D[Natural Emergence]\n    B -->|Creates| E[Resistance/Depletion]\n    D -->|Creates| F[Alignment/Growth]\n    G[Quality Recognition] -->|Informs| H[Better Metrics]\n    H -->|Supports| G\nThe Dubai Moment\nThis clarity crystallized watching our entrepreneurs share their work. Their stories weren't impressive because of impact numbers or scale metrics - though many had these. They moved us because we could recognize, directly and without analysis, the beauty of people aligned with genuine purpose. We saw what happens when someone connects with what they're meant to do and finds ways to serve that are uniquely theirs.\nTwo Eyes Open\nNow I understand: we need both eyes open. One eye for metrics and measurement - the map that helps us navigate and track progress. And one eye for direct quality recognition - the territory itself, the reality our maps try to represent. Like stereoscopic vision, it's the integration of both that gives depth and true understanding.\nThis isn't about abandoning metrics or structure. It's about putting them in proper place - as tools serving something more fundamental: our natural capacity to recognize and create quality, beauty, and meaning.\n\nTo help develop Part II (What's Really Missing), I'd like to ask:\n\nCan you share specific examples of how this quality recognition faculty showed up in your work before you had language for it? Times when you \"just knew\" something was right or wrong?\nHow does this faculty differ from intuition or emotion? What makes it more reliable?\nWhen you talk about both eyes being open, what specific practices help you maintain this integration of metrics and meaning?\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions so we can develop the next section? CopyRetryBGyou have descriptions of my quality recognition both at bloom and in my love story in your context window - perhaps ultimately in the quality recognition of the beauty in father greg boyles work, or the recognition of goodness that led me to work with Munir/Dara and the goodness that emerges from that vs the disease i felt when i was invited to aljazeera to talk about my work and i felt sleezy and slimy and like who am i - my work isn't authentic enough and sincere that i can shine like a clear glass showing the beauty, that tension led me to ask - how should i do things? what is a beautiful action? and i found father greg boyles work with homeboy and home girl industry helpfulintuition and emotion told me that i was doing things for the wrong reason, it was a tense feeling that pointed at my true source of meaning that was blocked from coming to live. that i wanted to be authentically a part of a community of mutual care, and hearing father greg boyles story showed me how it was possible and showed me how without artiface for \"doing the right thing\" it was possible to find a source of meaning and ... well, sort of do the right thing, except this time it's for a beautiful reason... no reason at all. because of the love of your friends - non instrumental. i didn't have that language and now i do and it helps instrumental things often have feelings associated. think of have to vs want to - have to is instrumental, ih ave to get a job to get... the tension that comes from instrumental things comes from the time it takes to do them that takes away from things you want to do, instrumental are things you'd automate/delegate/accelerate, something about rushing at Bloom shows me that we are instrumental. if we weren't operating instrumentally I don't think we'd feel like we were rushing all the time. it's a great symbol for us and for our teams - do you feel rushed? well, perhaps you're operating out of fear/instrumental/tense emotion indicators that there are ways of being you're not able to access and perhaps those ways of being willa ctually lead to the thing you want. for instance BLoom wants to build software to scale our impact, yet we build software first and then ask people to get on, vs building software after ensuring it helps us live our values through prototypes on paper, in manual systems, on spreadsheets, with airtable, etc gradually systematizing the context that creates emergence and beauty and streamlineing the things that need to be instrumental (for instance finding a mentors phone number or email)i think practices of presence helps, learning to trust slow is smooth and smooth is fast, acknowledging the quality perception is reliable and true to act on, and finding ways to discern it by addressing emotions directly, talking about them, seeing what they imply about blocked sources of meaning, which also helps with presence, as does deciding things, less things coming to mind to do, decide and chop (decide comes from incision) all the things that don't matter till you can be present with what doesEditThank you for these rich responses. Let me draft Part II of the essay, building on these insights:\nPart II: What's Really Missing - Beyond Metrics to Meaning\nThe Tension We All Feel\nThe rushing tells us something. When we feel constantly hurried at Bloom, when we push to build software before ensuring it serves real needs, when we chase metrics that don't quite capture what matters - these aren't just operational issues. They're symptoms of a deeper misalignment: trying to achieve meaningful ends through instrumental means.\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Rushing/Tension] -->|Signals| B[Instrumental Approach]\n    C[Presence/Flow] -->|Signals| D[Aligned Action]\n    B -->|Creates| E[More Rushing]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Natural Timing]\n    G[Fear/Have to] -->|Drives| B\n    H[Love/Want to] -->|Guides| D\nThe Different Quality of Non-Instrumental Action\nFather Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries illuminates this distinction perfectly. When asked about his \"impact metrics,\" he offers something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability - it's recognizing that real impact emerges from genuine relationship, not instrumental calculation.\nThis shows up in how we feel about our work. When invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera, I felt a deep unease - not because the work wasn't valuable, but because I sensed it wasn't yet flowing from that place of pure recognition and response. The contrast with Father Greg's natural authority was stark: his impact flows from friendship, while I was still caught in metrics and justification.\nThe Nature of Quality Recognition\nWhat we're missing isn't another framework or better metrics. It's trust in our capacity to recognize quality directly. This isn't intuition or emotion, though these can point us toward it. Rather:\n\nEmotions and tension often signal blocked meaning\n\"Have to\" versus \"want to\" reveals instrumental thinking\nRushing indicates misaligned action\nQuality recognition feels like natural rightness\n\nFrom Signals to Sources\nThe key shift happens when we learn to read these signals not as problems to solve but as pointers toward blocked sources of meaning:\n\nTension points to possibilities we're not seeing\nFear indicates protection rather than presence\nRushing reveals misaligned timing\nDoubt suggests disconnection from quality\n\nWhen we feel that sliminess of inauthenticity or the tension of forced metrics, we're receiving valuable information. These feelings aren't the truth itself - they're signals pointing toward a truth we already recognize but haven't yet trusted or acted upon.\nThe Practice of Presence\nDeveloping this capacity requires specific practices:\n\nSlowing down to sense what's really needed\nAddressing emotions directly to see what they reveal\nMaking clear decisions that reduce mental noise\nCreating space for quality recognition\nBuilding from authentic relationship\n\nThe result isn't slower work but what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - action that flows naturally from recognition rather than being forced by metrics or fear.\n\nTo help develop Part III (Gardens, Craft, and Seeing), I'd like to ask:\n\nHow does the gardening metaphor specifically help us understand the relationship between control and emergence in social impact work?\nWhat aspects of traditional craft practices most clearly illustrate the integration of metrics and meaning you're describing?\nCan you share specific examples of how this \"smooth is fast\" quality shows up when organizations trust quality recognition?\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions before we move to the next section? CopyRetryBGThe gardening metaphor helps us think about setting the stage and sitting back to witness and be in awe and to be in gratitude and to also have goals. Like, we want tomatoes. Right? We need tomatoes. We're hungry. But to plant the right seeds, right, the analogy of what that seed is, And to, set the right context for that seed, and to Hope for the things that you can't control And to live in that liminal space of hope and fear and concern and aliveness rather than planning and getting to the end of the strategy and the arrogance that comes in thinking that you think that you can figure out how the world works to keep yourself safe, which is not possible and not true. And so gardening, it puts you into that state of present state awareness, being in the now, watching, tending, feeling the water, seeing the soil, seeing the seeds, seeing the predators, seeing the pests and insects, learning to be a part of the system, and to be alive rather than to expect sameness. And if we're not gardeners, we want the world to be up operated more like a factory or like factory farm where we're just expecting inputs and outputs and this idea of control, which stems from this idea that we can't trust people. You know, that we can't trust. The world, we can't trust nature to provide. Right? And that humans are the ones that are gonna figure things out. We're gonna control and master the universe and get what we need out of it. And that's it. That that attitude builds fragility because we're building these systems in opposition to the emergence of nature rather than in harmony with And so gardening lets us build in harmony with And and to be alive and that state of, like, gratitude that comes when your trust and your Confidence that builds when you develop mastery iOS like, you know, I've done this for the last 10 years, 150 years. My family has done this for the last 100 years, 200 years. That yeah, you know, we've been through this before. We've had drought. We've had periods of hunger. But we've also made plans you know, We have an expertise where, you know, maybe we save part of our harvest. We learn to pickle. Know? Some of what we get, we don't eat all of our produce that we harvest every year. In anticipation for those dry years because that is also a part of the cycle, and that kind of history and wisdom and a crude knowledge and story of the world and story of self and gratitude for abundance and acknowledging there are periods of dryness and that we can be patient and that sort of is needed for that moment of abundance and and how beautiful is that? And I think traditional craft practices kind of connect moral relationally, with things, and that relationship is alive. I I know a relation you don't have a relationship. You live a relationship. It's dynamic. It's changing. And this idea of A craft turning material into relationships, turning stuff into a conversation that you have. With the person who holds the pot that you've made or who uses the systems that you're developing or who is experiencing the craft of your music of your performance, of your talk, of your workshop, for instance. All of these things are more relational, and this craft has these different qualities that I think are really important. Right? Like, in craft, You Connects with quality and quantity. You get into presence as you're planning the wood. The movement and the action is measuring as you are sensing, and there's that kind of coming together, this balance, this fulcrum point between the 2. And there's this connection of, like, you learn a craft You know that you don't start innovating when you first learn how to draw, that you like get through the paces. Picasso was really amazing at traditional drawing, and painting before he decided to break the form You have to know the form that you can break. And There's these, elements like Yeah. Connecting with sustainability because you wanna source material and you know what you're using. And it integrates materiality and Addresses alienation and there's a practicality to it. It's also really beautiful. Yeah. There's a different way of making relating. Valuing, scaling, that happens when we think through craft. Quality. There's a big part of craft. And iOS beauty is a big part of craft. The quality and quantity come together in a functional object that is also connected to the the the sense of meaning and and purpose that the crafts person has as they're making it and then imbues it with with physical and psychological and and like, beauty that you can you can sense and that you can engage with. And through attention, all of our different types of work can be a craft. We're connecting to presence and care and meaning. And there's a natural sensibility to sustainability because quality reduces waste, and it connects to traditional wisdom that is ecological and and and handed from the past to the present uses local materials and there's a community connection that creates culture And it's connected to skills and and kind of knowing yourself through what you're making. And craft requires attention. Right? And attention is the thing that is connected to presence into our values. Quality emerges from care and the type of slowness as well that helps us do the right thing. At the right time. And there's knowledge transfer that connects us into relationships with the past and the future. And with material understanding of, like, deep ecological knowledge and sustainable resource use. Smooth is fast. Quality shows up when organizations trust quality recognition. Yeah. That the the the realization that you can't access that recognition if you're rushing And then that recognition is more reliable source of knowing what to do You know? And, like, we've all had that experience of rushing and like, trying to cook dinner and then Like breaking a jar of beans and then taking a longer time to make dinner because you broke the jar of beans. And if we can just not break that jar of beans, and actually just take our time to be more confident and the energy that emerges from that sense of awareness like, the rightness and the ability to convince ourselves and convince others when we can point towards the source of meaning. That's why the idea that meaning has one source is so important because when we tap into that source of meaning, gonna be motivating for us and for others. And you know, by going slow enough to see that, to help others see that, we can go a lot faster because it'll be alignment and different skills from different people will be able to be put to use towards the direction that that beauty is indicatingEditThank you for this rich exploration. Let me draft Part III of the essay, integrating these insights:\nPart III: Gardens, Craft, and Seeing - Natural Models for Social Impact\nThe Wisdom of Gardens\nWhen we approach social impact like gardeners rather than factory managers, everything changes. A gardener needs tomatoes, yes - there are real outcomes to achieve. But they understand something profound about how change happens: you can't force a seed to grow. You can only create conditions that support its natural unfolding.\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Factory Mindset] -->|Attempts| B[Control/Force]\n    C[Garden Mindset] -->|Creates| D[Conditions for Growth]\n    B -->|Results in| E[Fragility]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Natural Resilience]\n    G[Wisdom/Experience] -->|Informs| H[Patient Action]\n    I[Present Awareness] -->|Guides| J[Timely Response]\nThis isn't passive - it requires deep engagement:\n\nReading the soil and weather\nUnderstanding natural cycles\nLearning from experience\nPlanning for lean times\nResponding to challenges\n\nBut it's a different kind of engagement. Instead of attempting to control outcomes through force, we participate in something larger. This creates natural resilience rather than artificial stability.\nThe Craft Way of Seeing\nCraft offers another crucial model. When a craftsperson works with materials, something remarkable happens: mere stuff becomes relationship. A pot isn't just clay shaped by technique - it's a conversation between maker, material, and eventual user. This transforms how we understand quality and scale:\nQuality Through Relationship\n\nDirect material engagement\nBalance of measurement and feeling\nIntegration of planning and presence\nNatural sustainability through care\n\nLearning Through Tradition\n\nMastering form before innovation\nKnowledge passed through practice\nCommunity-held wisdom\nDeep material understanding\n\nNatural Scale\n\nQuality reduces waste\nLocal materials create resilience\nSkills build community\nBeauty spreads naturally\n\nThe Integration of Measurement and Meaning\nWhat makes craft particularly relevant for social impact is how it naturally integrates quantitative and qualitative understanding. A craftsperson's movements embody both measurement and sensing - they're not separate activities but aspects of one integrated way of knowing.\nThis shows us how metrics and meaning can work together:\n\nQuality emerges from careful attention\nMeasurement serves beauty\nForm enables rather than constrains\nTradition guides innovation\n\nSmooth is Fast: The Paradox of Pace\nPerhaps most importantly, craft teaches us about timing. Like the cook who breaks the jar by rushing, we often create delays through forced speed. But when we trust quality recognition:\n\nNatural rhythm emerges\nRight action becomes clear\nOthers align naturally\nResources flow appropriately\n\nThis isn't slow for slowness' sake. It's what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - the paradoxical efficiency that comes from aligned action rather than forced effort.\nImplications for Social Impact\nThis suggests a different approach to social enterprise:\n\nCreate conditions rather than force outcomes\nBuild capacity through relationship\nLet quality guide growth\nTrust natural timing\n\nWhen we do this:\n\nImpact emerges naturally\nCommunities build resilience\nResources align with needs\nBeauty spreads organically\n\nThe key is seeing that, like gardens and craft, social impact isn't something we make happen through force. It's something we participate in through wise attention and aligned action.\n\nTo help develop Part IV (Practical Implications for Bloom), I'd like to ask:\n\nWhat specific practices or structures at Bloom would need to change first to embody these principles?\nHow would our relationship with entrepreneurs shift if we approached support more like gardening or craft apprenticeship?\nWhat experiments could we run to test these ideas while managing practical constraints?\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions before we move to the next section? CopyRetryBGI think one of the things that would have to change is our focus on the software and I would challenge our fundamental hypotheses about keeping quality while scaling and using software to have a bigger impact. I think we should focus on the elements of the software that we really believe in us are valuable and ignore the rest and just don’t even necessarily try to sell it like focus on the experience. I don’t believe that we’ve made something valuable that just needs to be sold. I think we are now at a point where AI and software development has developed to have made what we have made quite nearly irrelevant, and so it would be to look at our programs and look at our offerings and see who we can serve with who we our true craft what is our craft ? Once we find that I think we can figure out who will find that most valuable start to offer it to them and to kind of just acknowledge like what we really are and what we really have and the assessments I think we can do after the fact, we can use these assessments to help guide and to expose and to help people see, but they shouldn’t be the basis of our program and we shouldn’t try to force people onto these platforms and we shouldn’t try it. I just Everything we do is an instrument to make sure that we make a software platform they can sell because we want to get off of international funding. Let’s just find the thing that we can do that brings in money that is valuable that is clear that is coherent that is powerful and we have things because we can see that people love us people love our programs. Well if they love us so much why don’t they pay? Why don’t we make it possible for us to not have a complicated business model and at least have some thing that we can craft and do that’s our bread and butter and deals with like the things that matter to us and give us us insight as to what we can build and streamline and can access to people and develops our network and does all these things, but in a way where the model is clear. For our participants : to our entrepreneurs, they will feel seen, connected, increase in self knowledge which leads to self confidence, agency, know their fears, emotions, trust their perception of beauty, be more articulate about their values, know how to share, align, find resources themselves, not be perpetual program chasers, they will have access to knowledgable mentors, they will know what they are doing is a craft, that there's no shortcut, there's no hack, there is wisdom, there are beautiful ways of being, that wellbeing is not extricable from welldoing because wellbeing is touching with sources of meaning which include yourself, when you connect to that faculty you come alive, affecting yourself and your positive change in the team around you, the work you do, you become a light and attract people, funding, skills, knowledge, etc for our team we will work more on gardening, cultivating circumstance, situations, finding the right knowledgable mentors ensure we sit with them long enough and we're sure that our space holding and emergent principles are understood, felt, imbibed and valued, we will seek funding that doesn't lead us to treat our participants as instrumental, our customers will also be those whom we impact, including funders, they are a part of the presencing field - deeper connections, more time with teams, we will use our quantitatie frameworks to monitor at the end of the day / week / month / program and in the day, at the start we begin with understanding, seeing, feeling, knowing, emerging, and touch the territory before we plug in numbers on the map and see where we are going for our partners they will be integrated more deeply, they will find and connect with their sources of meaning, how it shows up in our programs, for our teams, we will find funding that flows where people value rather than some idea of value, or social norm of \"good\" - we'll touch reality together and in terms of the experiment so we can run. I think we should talk about that together. We should look at what we have to offer and I sort of propose the idea of this framework developing to come alive being a sellable coaching practice for the course of a month and we run maybe the first few as pro bono tests and maybe even do it in partnership with professional coaches to get their kind of accreditation behind us and then from there we can take our lessons learned and sell some seats and that could be our bread and butter paid work - it’s ok that it doesn’t scale - I think it’ll feel real and whole and good and give us insights into what should scaleEditPart IV: Practical Implications for Bloom - From Platform to Practice\nRethinking Our Foundation\nThe most profound implication of this shift in thinking requires us to challenge our core assumption: that software is our path to scale and sustainability. In an age where AI and new technologies are rapidly transforming digital tools, we need to ask ourselves a more fundamental question: What is our true craft?\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Current Approach] -->|Forces| B[Platform Usage]\n    C[Craft Approach] -->|Enables| D[Natural Value]\n    B -->|Creates| E[Artificial Engagement]\n    D -->|Generates| F[Authentic Growth]\n    G[Quality Recognition] -->|Guides| H[Service Evolution]\n    I[Software] -->|Supports| J[Human Connection]\nWhat We Really Offer\nThe evidence of our value is clear but misunderstood:\n\nPeople love our programs\nTransformation happens consistently\nDeep connections form\nReal growth emerges\n\nYet we've been trying to capture this in software, attempting to scale what might not be meant for scaling. Instead, we need to:\n\nFocus on our genuine craft\nLet value guide structure\nAllow natural growth\nTrust quality recognition\n\nA New Model for Our Work\nFor Entrepreneurs\nInstead of pushing platform engagement, we create conditions where they:\n\nFeel truly seen and connected\nDevelop self-knowledge and confidence\nLearn to trust their quality recognition\nAccess genuine wisdom\nFind natural resources and support\n\nFor Our Team\nWe shift from monitoring to nurturing:\n\nCultivating circumstances for growth\nFinding and connecting with true mentors\nEnsuring principles are embodied not just understood\nUsing metrics to reflect rather than direct\nStarting with territory before consulting maps\n\nFor Partners\nRelationships deepen naturally:\n\nIntegration with meaning\nAuthentic value creation\nReality-based assessment\nNatural resource flow\n\nThe Path Forward\nSpecific Changes Required:\n\nProgram Focus\n\n\nStart with direct relationship\nLet technology support not lead\nMeasure after, not during\nBuild from real value\n\n\nBusiness Model\n\n\nSimple, clear value proposition\nDirect payment for real service\nNatural growth from quality\nSustainable core practice\n\n\nAssessment Approach\n\n\nQuality recognition first\nMetrics for reflection\nNatural feedback loops\nOrganic development\n\nPractical Experiments\n\nCome Alive Coaching\n\n\nStart with pro bono trials\nPartner with professional coaches\nDocument real transformation\nBuild from genuine results\n\n\nCore Practice Development\n\n\nIdentify our true craft\nFocus on direct value\nLet natural scale emerge\nTrust quality recognition\n\n\nRelationship Restructuring\n\n\nDirect connection with participants\nValue-based funding relationships\nCommunity of practice\nNatural growth patterns\n\nThe Technology Question\nInstead of forcing platform adoption, technology should:\n\nSupport human connection\nEnable natural processes\nDocument real value\nScale what works naturally\n\nThis means:\n\nSimpler tools\nDirect support of practice\nNatural integration\nOrganic growth\n\nMeasuring Success Differently\nSuccess looks like:\n\nReal transformation in participants\nSustainable value creation\nNatural resource flow\nCommunity growth\nQuality recognition development\n\nThis isn't abandoning scale but trusting that:\n\nQuality creates natural growth\nValue attracts resources\nBeauty spreads organically\nWisdom develops naturally\n\nThe key is starting with what's real and valuable, letting genuine craft guide our development rather than forcing growth through artificial means.\n\nTo help develop our final section (Path Forward), I'd like to ask:\n\nWhat specific elements of our current work most clearly embody this approach already?\nHow do we help stakeholders understand and trust this shift?\nWhat would success look like in 6 months if we follow this path?\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions before we complete the essay? CopyRetryBGI think our custom learning journey that focuses on helping people kind of identify the challenges in their life and their projects with assessments is actually a really good Start It's not that I'm only negative in critiquing our, software. I mean, that part is is is great. Our upside on pyramid approach where we focus on people answering their own questions first. Is trying to get at something here. Our, discussion of well-being, opening the space for people to talk about kind of the quality of their life and and how they're feeling Even Though taking the assessments and we don't actually really dig into it as much as we could. And don't talk about emotions and what they mean. We don't have a really clear language of sources of meaning yet. But I do think that having to start with why and trying to get people really clear on their intentions It's also another really great element. And breakout rooms and the kind of aliveness that we bring to our virtual facilitation the mentor program is is okay. I think it can be improved. Just the fact that we really try to give People connections to to to each other, to to mentors, to themselves, and really focusing on, like, all those deeper relationships. Right? It's like people with themselves, people with the people in the cohort, people with their mentors, and the programs that we run are pretty good. But idea of trying to start selling our software as is I'm not sure sure. It's actually quite useful because it doesn't actually Systematizer implements a lot of these things that require require a facilitator. Right? We we didn't build software that will that has kind of, like, a guide You know, people onboard right now, and there's nobody. It's just them, and and it kind of misses the points of things. And, you know, we're missing the community element that was not very integrated very well and the The notes section, you know, and we used to have program notes that people would be able to share like, on the platform with everyone in the program, but also kind of reflect on a couple of key questions that I thought was really helpful to, like, add that reflective process into our, software. And even that by itself just like getting in asking yourself, like, what do I wanna do today? What's the what's going on? And kind of exposing that both for yourself and your team and then potentially even people in the in the cohort was a really cool element that We removed Android I really miss it. What do how can we help stakeholders understand this shift? Well, I think stakeholders there are people out there that are trying to do philanthropy differently. That are trying to uphold certain values and ways of being and they're looking for a way forward, and I think we could really show some leadership here. There are foundations that focus on bringing to life spirituality in a practical way that is maybe cross cultural and cross religious and connects people with what matters. And I can think of, like, the Lilly Foundation, for and others We can find the right funders. And then what I think can happen is as we, find the right funders and we show our current funders the examples that we have about all of these businesses that are doing things different from Patagonia and onward that you can be both successful and doing things for the right reasons, and there's no reason not to and all the reasons that we should because we can't kind of perpetuate a way of seeing the world in ourselves through these enacted processes that are self reinforcing and just claim that this is the only way possible. When we have some examples that have broken the mold that have shown that there is solid ground underneath these ways and we should be contributing to them and not you know, missing out on that opportunity. And then just showing people like, get on the bus. We're going. Join us. In 6 months, I think success would look like a validated coming alive process Maybe a New sort of accelerator or incubator Claude, and just cleaning the language of in all of our guides of this speed and of this goal orientation. And finding new funders interested in funding a different way of supporting change in the world and really articulating the vision of the super bloom starting with the seeds that we're planting in this global garden. That Is being cultivated. I'm talking about, like, the cultivation of the super bloom not these sort of, like, Like, just the the forcing of the helping people come up with goals and strategies and habits of success, like, removing all of that language about habits of success forcing, like, goal orientation and instrumentalization of people and even instrumentalization of well-being, turning it what we what we have. And just like cleaning it of all that way of thinking that has influenced both me and and you know, like, I've grown and I've changed the way I see things, but we have so much good that I think we can take Android do in a different way with some slight shifts And in 6 months, I think we will have a new program to be able to offer the world and validated it by running coaching programs and hope hopefully having money coming in from our coaching and even potentially having, like, our coaching plus technology. So embedding us more deeply into our work and us having these deeper relationships with mentors if we want scalability and with AI if we want scalability, but us still having these deeper relationships and connections with people and passing on And being a part of the line of transmission of apprentice master. Right? And and becoming masters ourselves of what we're doing because we've done for so many years now. I think we have something to offer that you know, when we coach people, we can help them come to life. We can help them see what they're not seeing. And we can get better at it. And and once we become these masters, we can pass that on to the mentors. We pass that on to the software kind of architecture that creates this situation for emergence rather than this place where we get data from people. We get people to use the software to connect with each other, to connect with themselves, And in the process of doing the real thing, we can also have our outputs and get the territory to be the thing people are exploring and then for the software to be drawing out the maps. The end of the day, not the beginning of the day. Is the way I like to frame it and analogize it.

Could you share more about specific moments where this shift in perception became clear - especially in your work with entrepreneurs?\nThe Al Jazeera story reveals something about authentic authority vs constructed impact. How has this insight shaped your understanding of what social impact organizations really need?\nYou mentioned the Dubai moment when tears flowed and hearts opened - what specifically did you recognize in that moment about the relationship between metrics and meaning?\n\nThese elements could help strengthen Part I by:\n\nGrounding theory in lived experience\nShowing progression of understanding\nMaking stakes more concrete\nConnecting personal journey to organizational implications\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions to help refine Part I? CopyRetryBG Yeah. Okay. So sorry about trying to do good to recognizing beauty directly and having good emerge. Yeah. I think You know, as we've been trying to support social enterprises, I've been initially, you know, like, feeling like their ideas of what good would look like if we connected with research and assessments that are validated and being able to know, kind of unify a segmented in industry of impact and show people's progress from one You know, accelerated to the next and And, like, somehow I feel like this is becoming less important to me as I really think that every success story is a unique story, and we can, like, see the patterns and maybe learn from them. But as we're moving into uncharted waters, we need new ways to be successful, to be shown from these people, and they need to trust themselves, and they need to learn from others. And so that balance between recognizing mastery and expertise and being the apprentice but also being the teacher. About what what is new and what can emerge. And the Aljazirah story talks about authentic authority versus constructed impact. Yeah. So social impact organizations need to have a real true story. Not just a story. Just a story of the problem and the solution and how they're the right person to do it, but a story that is true and alive and evolves and grows with them. And something that when they touch it, it has that coming alive juice that we get when we touch a real source of meaning, and we know why it's Meaningful. For them in a specific way, not an abstract way. Like, just like we use Joe Edelman and his values Claude, sources of meaning approach, and attentional policies. Like, getting to that level of granularity where we can ask people to tell us, you know, their origin stories and their sources of meaning they can be specific about it and Claude, and this is a beautiful and important thing both for them to know makes them come alive and how not to lose touch of that as they're working and making sure that those things are kind of know, maybe anchor points that can move certainly as we learn and grow and develop, but anchor points to help guide and move, an organization to the future and draw people that relate and resonate with those sources of meaning and funders that resonate with those sources of meaning instead of having these kind of abstract concepts of like, okay. Which funders are interested in Claude? And then which people are working on Claude? And which funders are interested in education. And which people are working on education or some kind of more like, other sort of elements of, like, oh, this person needs leadership and team building skills and who have leadership and team building skills. Think we can get kind of more to you know, if people really align on what's meaningful both in terms of what they're aspiring towards from role models and what they need can do better matchmaking between our partners, our mentors, and teams, and each other. And maybe at some point even get people to form teams based on these things and help people form teams. Yeah. So in that moment, I realized, like, in Dubai, I saw, like, I was living the thing that I valued And that when I was back in Not during a session Android was working on either a software or some report some other thing, the if it wasn't supporting that moments and these types of experiences, I'm not sure that it would be so meaningful for me. And so somehow either being able to connect with that as I'm doing the other work or indefinitely in ensuring that the things that made that moment so meaningful show up in as much of the other work as possible. Sure. There are going to be some instrumental things that we just have to do like send like putting out emails to the funders to schedule a call and finding time on our calendars that works for both of us. But if there's some kind of intentionality behind that, in recognition of pursuing sources of meaning or designing a our business to attend to these sources of meaning, I think it would be really important and and powerful. So let's take, all of the new insights that we've had and the stories that we've gained, and let's, rewrite part 1 and, move into you know, asking some more questions after you give me part 1 to work on part 2. And sort of review the whole thing as well. Like, how are we doing with the essay? Is there any flaws or draw backs or issues or critiques that might come up that we need to address?EditThank you for these rich insights. Let me rewrite Part I integrating these elements, then assess where we are with the overall essay.\nPart I: From Doing Good to Recognizing Beauty\nThe Moment Everything Changed\nIn Dubai, watching entrepreneurs share their stories during our retreat, something shifted. As tears flowed and hearts opened, I witnessed something our carefully designed metrics and platforms could never capture: the pure beauty of people fully aligned with their calling. It wasn't just emotional response - it was recognition of something real, something our impact frameworks weren't built to see.\nThe Two Ways of Seeing\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Conventional Impact] -->|Focuses on| B[Metrics/Frameworks]\n    C[Quality Recognition] -->|Sees| D[Natural Beauty]\n    B -->|Creates| E[Constructed Stories]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Authentic Authority]\n    G[Personal Journey] -->|Shifts from| H[Doing Good]\n    G -->|Toward| I[Recognizing Beauty]\nI felt this tension acutely when invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera. Despite our impressive metrics and frameworks, something felt inauthentic. We had constructed a story of impact rather than allowing real meaning to emerge and speak for itself. This wasn't about inadequate measurement - it was about a fundamental misalignment in how we were seeing.\nBeyond Best Practices\nInitially, our approach made perfect sense: validate assessments, unify a fragmented impact industry, track progress across accelerator programs. But as I worked with more entrepreneurs, I began to see something different. Every real success story was unique - not because it defied measurement, but because it emerged from authentic connection to meaning.\nThis isn't about abandoning measurement but about seeing with both eyes:\n\nOne eye for metrics and frameworks\nOne eye for direct quality recognition\nBoth needed for depth perception\n\nThe Nature of Real Authority\nWhat makes Father Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries so powerful isn't his impact metrics - it's the simple truth when he says \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability; it's revealing a different kind of authority that comes from authentic relationship rather than constructed impact.\nA Different Kind of Story\nWe've learned that social enterprises need more than problem-solution narratives. They need stories that:\n\nEmerge from real meaning\nEvolve organically\nConnect specifically to sources of meaning\nCreate natural resonance\n\nWhen entrepreneurs connect with their true sources of meaning, they naturally:\n\nAttract aligned resources\nBuild authentic relationships\nCreate lasting impact\nEnable natural growth\n\nThe Path Forward\nThis suggests a fundamental shift in how we support social impact:\n\nFrom constructing impact to recognizing beauty\nFrom forcing growth to enabling emergence\nFrom measuring change to embodying meaning\nFrom doing good to being alive\n\n\nThree questions for developing Part II:\n\nHow specifically does this capacity for quality recognition develop? Can you share examples of entrepreneurs discovering/trusting it?\nWhat makes this different from \"following your heart\" or \"trusting intuition\"? What gives it reliability?\nWhat blocks access to this faculty, especially in social impact work? What helps clear these blocks?\n\nBefore moving forward, some potential critiques to address:\n\nCould seem too abstract/impractical\nMight appear to dismiss importance of metrics\nCould be seen as privileging feeling over evidence\nMight not address practical constraints\n\nWould you like to:\n\nAddress any of these critiques?\nAnswer the questions for Part II?\nRefine Part I further?\n\nThe key is maintaining both practical relevance and depth while showing how this shift could transform social impact work."

When we feel constantly hurried at Bloom, when we push to build software before ensuring it serves real needs, when we chase metrics that don't quite capture what matters - these aren't just operational issues. They're symptoms of a deeper misalignment: trying to achieve meaningful ends through instrumental means.\n\nThe Different Quality of Non-Instrumental Action \nFather Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries illuminates this distinction perfectly. When asked about his \"impact metrics,\" he offers something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability - it's recognizing that real impact emerges from genuine relationship, not instrumental calculation.\n\nThis shows up in how we feel about our work. When invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera, I felt a deep unease - not because the work wasn't valuable, but because I sensed it wasn't yet flowing from that place of pure recognition and response. The contrast with Father Greg's natural authority was stark: his impact flows from friendship, while I was still caught in metrics and justification.\n\nThe Nature of Quality Recognition \nWhat we're missing isn't another framework or better metrics. It's trust in our capacity to recognize quality directly. This isn't intuition or emotion, though these can point us toward it. Rather:\n\n- Emotions and tension often signal blocked meaning\n- \"Have to\" versus \"want to\" reveals instrumental thinking \n- Rushing indicates misaligned action\n- Quality recognition feels like natural rightness\n\nFrom Signals to Sources\nThe key shift happens when we learn to read these signals not as problems to solve but as pointers toward blocked sources of meaning:  \n- Tension points to possibilities we're not seeing\n- Fear indicates protection rather than presence \n- Rushing reveals misaligned timing\n- Doubt suggests disconnection from quality\n\nWhen we feel that sliminess of inauthenticity or the tension of forced metrics, we're receiving valuable information. These feelings aren't the truth itself - they're signals pointing toward a truth we already recognize but haven't yet trusted or acted upon.\n\nThe Practice of Presence\nDeveloping this capacity requires specific practices:\n- Slowing down to sense what's really needed  \n- Addressing emotions directly to see what they reveal\n- Making clear decisions that reduce mental noise\n- Creating space for quality recognition \n- Building from authentic relationship\n\nThe result isn't slower work but what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - action that flows naturally from recognition rather than being forced by metrics or fear.\n\nPart III: Gardens, Craft, and Seeing - Natural Models for Social Impact\n\nThe Wisdom of Gardens\nWhen we approach social impact like gardeners rather than factory managers, everything changes. A gardener needs tomatoes, yes - there are real outcomes to achieve. But they understand something profound about how change happens: you can't force a seed to grow. You can only create conditions that support its natural unfolding. \n\nThis isn't passive - it requires deep engagement:\n- Reading the soil and weather\n- Understanding natural cycles \n- Learning from experience\n- Planning for lean times\n- Responding to challenges\n\nBut it's a different kind of engagement. Instead of attempting to control outcomes through force, we participate in something larger. This creates natural resilience rather than artificial stability.\n\nThe Craft Way of Seeing\nCraft offers another crucial model. When a craftsperson works with materials, something remarkable happens: mere stuff becomes relationship. A pot isn't just clay shaped by technique - it's a conversation between maker, material, and eventual user. This transforms how we understand quality and scale:\n\nQuality Through Relationship\n- Direct material engagement \n- Balance of measurement and feeling\n- Integration of planning and presence\n- Natural sustainability through care\n\nLearning Through Tradition   \n- Mastering form before innovation\n- Knowledge passed through practice\n- Community-held wisdom\n- Deep material understanding\n\nNatural Scale\n- Quality reduces waste\n- Local materials create resilience\n- Skills build community\n- Beauty spreads naturally\n\nThe Integration of Measurement and Meaning\nWhat makes craft particularly relevant for social impact is how it naturally integrates quantitative and qualitative understanding. A craftsperson's movements embody both measurement and sensing - they're not separate activities but aspects of one integrated way of knowing. \n\nThis shows us how metrics and meaning can work together:\n- Quality emerges from careful attention\n- Measurement serves beauty\n- Form enables rather than constrains\n- Tradition guides innovation\n\nSmooth is Fast: The Paradox of Pace\nPerhaps most importantly, craft teaches us about timing. Like the cook who breaks the jar by rushing, we often create delays through forced speed. But when we trust quality recognition:\n- Natural rhythm emerges \n- Right action becomes clear\n- Others align naturally\n- Resources flow appropriately\n\nThis isn't slow for slowness' sake. It's what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - the paradoxical efficiency that comes from aligned action rather than forced effort.\n\nImplications for Social Impact\nThis suggests a different approach to social enterprise:  \n- Create conditions rather than force outcomes\n- Build capacity through relationship\n- Let quality guide growth \n- Trust natural timing\n \nWhen we do this:\n- Impact emerges naturally\n- Communities build resilience  \n- Resources align with needs\n- Beauty spreads organically\n\nThe key is seeing that, like gardens and craft, social impact isn't something we make happen through force. It's something we participate in through wise attention and aligned action.\n\nPart IV: Practical Implications for Bloom - From Platform to Practice\n\nRethinking Our Foundation \nThe most profound implication of this shift in thinking requires us to challenge our core assumption: that software is our path to scale and sustainability. In an age where AI and new technologies are rapidly transforming digital tools, we need to ask ourselves a more fundamental question: What is our true craft?\n\nWhat We Really Offer\nThe evidence of our value is clear but misunderstood: \n- People love our programs\n- Transformation happens consistently\n- Deep connections form  \n- Real growth emerges\n\nYet we've been trying to capture this in software, attempting to scale what might not be meant for scaling. Instead, we need to:\n- Focus on our genuine craft  \n- Let value guide structure\n- Allow natural growth\n- Trust quality recognition\n\nA New Model for Our Work\nFor Entrepreneurs\nInstead of pushing platform engagement, we create conditions where they:\n- Feel truly seen and connected\n- Develop self-knowledge and confidence\n- Learn to trust their quality recognition\n- Access genuine wisdom\n- Find natural resources and support\n\nFor Our Team \nWe shift from monitoring to nurturing:\n- Cultivating circumstances for growth\n- Finding and connecting with true mentors\n- Ensuring principles are embodied not just understood\n- Using metrics to reflect rather than direct\n- Starting with territory before consulting maps\n\nFor Partners\nRelationships deepen naturally:\n- Integration with meaning\n- Authentic value creation\n- Reality-based assessment \n- Natural resource flow\n\nThe Path Forward\nSpecific Changes Required:\n- Program Focus: Start with direct relationship; Let technology support not lead; Measure after, not during; Build from real value\n- Business Model: Simple, clear value proposition; Direct payment for real service; Natural growth from quality; Sustainable core practice\n- Assessment Approach: Quality recognition first; Metrics for reflection; Natural feedback loops; Organic development\n \nPractical Experiments \nCome Alive Coaching\n- Start with pro bono trials\n- Partner with professional coaches\n- Document real transformation\n- Build from genuine results\n\nCore Practice Development\n- Identify our true craft\n- Focus on direct value \n- Let natural scale emerge\n- Trust quality recognition\n\nRelationship Restructuring\n- Direct connection with participants\n- Value-based funding relationships\n- Community of practice\n- Natural growth patterns\n\nThe Technology Question\nInstead of forcing platform adoption, technology should:\n- Support human connection\n- Enable natural processes\n- Document real value\n- Scale what works naturally\n\nThis means:\n- Simpler tools\n- Direct support of practice\n- Natural integration\n- Organic growth\n\nMeasuring Success Differently  \nSuccess looks like:\n- Real transformation in participants\n- Sustainable value creation\n- Natural resource flow\n- Community growth\n- Quality recognition development\n\nThis isn't abandoning scale but trusting that: \n- Quality creates natural growth\n- Value attracts resources\n- Beauty spreads organically\n- Wisdom develops naturally\n\nThe key is starting with what's real and valuable, letting genuine craft guide our development rather than forcing growth through artificial means.\n\nPart V: The Path Forward - From Where We Are to Where We're Called\n\nBuilding from Strength\nLooking clearly at our work, we already have powerful elements aligned with this vision:\n\nWhat's Working:\n- Learning Journeys: Custom assessment approach; Personal challenge identification; Individual growth paths\n- Core Practices: Upside-down pyramid methodology; Starting with deeper why; Focus on wellbeing; Breaking out for connection; Relationship building  \n- Community Elements: Cohort connections; Mentor relationships; Peer learning; Reflective practice\n\nNecessary Shifts\nFrom Software-First to Human-First: \n- Technology supports don't leads\n- Community precedes platform\n- Relationship drives development\n- Reflection guides action\n\nFrom Metrics to Meaning:\n- Remove \"habits of success\" language\n- Shift from goals to emergence\n- Transform assessment approach\n- Start with territory, end with maps\n\nFrom Programs to Practice:\n- Coaching as core offering\n- Deep relationship building\n- Master-apprentice model \n- Natural development paths\n\nPractical Next Steps\nImmediate Actions (1-3 months):\n- Launch pilot coaching program\n- Clean language/materials \n- Document current successes\n- Start stakeholder conversations\n\nMedium Term (3-6 months):\n- Validate \"Come Alive\" methodology\n- Develop new funding relationships\n- Create craft-based accelerator model\n- Build natural assessment approach\n\nLong Term Vision:\n- Become transmission line for wisdom\n- Create conditions for emergence \n- Enable natural scale through quality\n- Build true mastery\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nFinding Aligned Partners: \n- Foundations focused on practical spirituality\n- Funders seeking systemic change\n- Partners valuing depth over scale\n- Communities supporting transformation\n\nDemonstrating Value: \n- Share success stories  \n- Show alternative models working\n- Document real transformation\n- Build evidence through practice\n\nCreating New Narratives:\n- From scale to depth\n- From metrics to meaning  \n- From control to emergence\n- From programs to practice\n\nMeasures of Success\nIn 6 months we should see:\nValidated Methodology  \n- Tested coaching approach\n- Clear value proposition\n- Natural payment model  \n- Direct impact evidence\n\nTransformed Relationships\n- Deeper mentor connections\n- Stronger community bonds\n- Aligned funding partners\n- Clear transmission lines\n\nNew Offerings \n- Craft-based accelerator\n- Integrated technology support\n- Quality-centered assessment\n- Natural growth patterns\n\nThe Super Bloom Vision\nInstead of forcing growth, we cultivate conditions where:\n- Beauty emerges naturally\n- Wisdom transfers clearly\n- Community builds organically\n- Impact flows naturally\n\nThis isn't slower - it's aligned with natural timing. Not smaller - but scaled through quality. Not less impactful - but transformative at the root. \n\nThe key is trusting that when we align with quality:\n- Right relationships form\n- Resources flow naturally  \n- Impact emerges organically\n- Beauty spreads naturally\n\nOur role becomes:\n- Creating conditions\n- Supporting emergence\n- Enabling transmission\n- Trusting quality\n\nThis is how we contribute to the super bloom - not by forcing growth but by planting seeds in fertile soil, tending with wisdom, and trusting the natural unfolding of beauty and impact.\n\nThree final questions:\n\n1. How can we most effectively communicate this vision in a way that inspires stakeholders while addressing legitimate concerns around scale, evidence, and feasibility? \n\n2. What specific practices can we implement immediately to start embodying these principles in our day-to-day work, even before making larger structural changes?\n\n3. How will we know we're on the right track? What signs of natural growth and alignment should we look for to validate that this approach is working?\n\nOverall, I believe this essay presents a compelling case for a fundamental shift in how we understand and pursue social impact. It grounds this vision in lived experience, offers concrete models and practices, and charts a path from current reality to future possibility.\n\nThe key will be translating these insights into aligned action - not as a new dogma but as an ongoing practice of wise participation. By staying true to what we already know, while daring to trust the deeper wisdom of quality, beauty, and natural unfolding, we can pioneer a new paradigm for social change.",

It wasn't just emotional response - it was recognition of something real, something our impact frameworks weren't built to see.\n\nThe Two Ways of Seeing\nI felt this tension acutely when invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera. Despite our impressive metrics and frameworks, something felt inauthentic. We had constructed a story of impact rather than allowing real meaning to emerge and speak for itself. This wasn't about inadequate measurement - it was about a fundamental misalignment in how we were seeing.\n\nBeyond Best Practices \nInitially, our approach made perfect sense: validate assessments, unify a fragmented impact industry, track progress across accelerator programs. But as I worked with more entrepreneurs, I began to see something different. Every real success story was unique - not because it defied measurement, but because it emerged from authentic connection to meaning.\n\nThis isn't about abandoning measurement but about seeing with both eyes:\n- One eye for metrics and frameworks \n- One eye for direct quality recognition\n- Both needed for depth perception\n\nThe Nature of Real Authority\nWhat makes Father Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries so powerful isn't his impact metrics - it's the simple truth when he says \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability; it's revealing a different kind of authority that comes from authentic relationship rather than constructed impact. \n\nA Different Kind of Story\nWe've learned that social enterprises need more than problem-solution narratives. They need stories that:\n- Emerge from real meaning\n- Evolve organically \n- Connect specifically to sources of meaning\n- Create natural resonance\n\nWhen entrepreneurs connect with their true sources of meaning, they naturally:\n- Attract aligned resources\n- Build authentic relationships  \n- Create lasting impact\n- Enable natural growth\n\nThe Path Forward\nThis suggests a fundamental shift in how we support social impact:  \n- From constructing impact to recognizing beauty\n- From forcing growth to enabling emergence\n- From measuring change to embodying meaning \n- From doing good to being alive\n\nPart II: What's Really Missing - Beyond Metrics to Meaning\n\nThe Tension We All Feel\nThe rushing tells us something. When we feel constantly hurried at Bloom, when we push to build software before ensuring it serves real needs, when we chase metrics that don't quite capture what matters - these aren't just operational issues. They're symptoms of a deeper misalignment: trying to achieve meaningful ends through instrumental means.\n\nThe Different Quality of Non-Instrumental Action \nFather Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries illuminates this distinction perfectly. When asked about his \"impact metrics,\" he offers something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability - it's recognizing that real impact emerges from genuine relationship, not instrumental calculation.\n\nThis shows up in how we feel about our work. When invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera, I felt a deep unease - not because the work wasn't valuable, but because I sensed it wasn't yet flowing from that place of pure recognition and response. The contrast with Father Greg's natural authority was stark: his impact flows from friendship, while I was still caught in metrics and justification.\n\nThe Nature of Quality Recognition \nWhat we're missing isn't another framework or better metrics. It's trust in our capacity to recognize quality directly. This isn't intuition or emotion, though these can point us toward it. Rather:\n\n- Emotions and tension often signal blocked meaning\n- \"Have to\" versus \"want to\" reveals instrumental thinking \n- Rushing indicates misaligned action\n- Quality recognition feels like natural rightness\n\nFrom Signals to Sources\nThe key shift happens when we learn to read these signals not as problems to solve but as pointers toward blocked sources of meaning:  \n- Tension points to possibilities we're not seeing\n- Fear indicates protection rather than presence \n- Rushing reveals misaligned timing\n- Doubt suggests disconnection from quality\n\nWhen we feel that sliminess of inauthenticity or the tension of forced metrics, we're receiving valuable information. These feelings aren't the truth itself - they're signals pointing toward a truth we already recognize but haven't yet trusted or acted upon.\n\nThe Practice of Presence\nDeveloping this capacity requires specific practices:\n- Slowing down to sense what's really needed  \n- Addressing emotions directly to see what they reveal\n- Making clear decisions that reduce mental noise\n- Creating space for quality recognition \n- Building from authentic relationship\n\nThe result isn't slower work but what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - action that flows naturally from recognition rather than being forced by metrics or fear.\n\nPart III: Gardens, Craft, and Seeing - Natural Models for Social Impact\n\nThe Wisdom of Gardens\nWhen we approach social impact like gardeners rather than factory managers, everything changes. A gardener needs tomatoes, yes - there are real outcomes to achieve. But they understand something profound about how change happens: you can't force a seed to grow. You can only create conditions that support its natural unfolding. \n\nThis isn't passive - it requires deep engagement:\n- Reading the soil and weather\n- Understanding natural cycles \n- Learning from experience\n- Planning for lean times\n- Responding to challenges\n\nBut it's a different kind of engagement. Instead of attempting to control outcomes through force, we participate in something larger. This creates natural resilience rather than artificial stability.\n\nThe Craft Way of Seeing\nCraft offers another crucial model. When a craftsperson works with materials, something remarkable happens: mere stuff becomes relationship. A pot isn't just clay shaped by technique - it's a conversation between maker, material, and eventual user. This transforms how we understand quality and scale:\n\nQuality Through Relationship\n- Direct material engagement \n- Balance of measurement and feeling\n- Integration of planning and presence\n- Natural sustainability through care\n\nLearning Through Tradition   \n- Mastering form before innovation\n- Knowledge passed through practice\n- Community-held wisdom\n- Deep material understanding\n\nNatural Scale\n- Quality reduces waste\n- Local materials create resilience\n- Skills build community\n- Beauty spreads naturally\n\nThe Integration of Measurement and Meaning\nWhat makes craft particularly relevant for social impact is how it naturally integrates quantitative and qualitative understanding. A craftsperson's movements embody both measurement and sensing - they're not separate activities but aspects of one integrated way of knowing. \n\nThis shows us how metrics and meaning can work together:\n- Quality emerges from careful attention\n- Measurement serves beauty\n- Form enables rather than constrains\n- Tradition guides innovation\n\nSmooth is Fast: The Paradox of Pace\nPerhaps most importantly, craft teaches us about timing. Like the cook who breaks the jar by rushing, we often create delays through forced speed. But when we trust quality recognition:\n- Natural rhythm emerges \n- Right action becomes clear\n- Others align naturally\n- Resources flow appropriately\n\nThis isn't slow for slowness' sake. It's what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - the paradoxical efficiency that comes from aligned action rather than forced effort.\n\nImplications for Social Impact\nThis suggests a different approach to social enterprise:  \n- Create conditions rather than force outcomes\n- Build capacity through relationship\n- Let quality guide growth \n- Trust natural timing\n \nWhen we do this:\n- Impact emerges naturally\n- Communities build resilience  \n- Resources align with needs\n- Beauty spreads organically\n\nThe key is seeing that, like gardens and craft, social impact isn't something we make happen through force. It's something we participate in through wise attention and aligned action.\n\nPart IV: Practical Implications for Bloom - From Platform to Practice\n\nRethinking Our Foundation \nThe most profound implication of this shift in thinking requires us to challenge our core assumption: that software is our path to scale and sustainability. In an age where AI and new technologies are rapidly transforming digital tools, we need to ask ourselves a more fundamental question: What is our true craft?\n\nWhat We Really Offer\nThe evidence of our value is clear but misunderstood: \n- People love our programs\n- Transformation happens consistently\n- Deep connections form  \n- Real growth emerges\n\nYet we've been trying to capture this in software, attempting to scale what might not be meant for scaling. Instead, we need to:\n- Focus on our genuine craft  \n- Let value guide structure\n- Allow natural growth\n- Trust quality recognition\n\nA New Model for Our Work\nFor Entrepreneurs\nInstead of pushing platform engagement, we create conditions where they:\n- Feel truly seen and connected\n- Develop self-knowledge and confidence\n- Learn to trust their quality recognition\n- Access genuine wisdom\n- Find natural resources and support\n\nFor Our Team \nWe shift from monitoring to nurturing:\n- Cultivating circumstances for growth\n- Finding and connecting with true mentors\n- Ensuring principles are embodied not just understood\n- Using metrics to reflect rather than direct\n- Starting with territory before consulting maps\n\nFor Partners\nRelationships deepen naturally:\n- Integration with meaning\n- Authentic value creation\n- Reality-based assessment \n- Natural resource flow\n\nThe Path Forward\nSpecific Changes Required:\n- Program Focus: Start with direct relationship; Let technology support not lead; Measure after, not during; Build from real value\n- Business Model: Simple, clear value proposition; Direct payment for real service; Natural growth from quality; Sustainable core practice\n- Assessment Approach: Quality recognition first; Metrics for reflection; Natural feedback loops; Organic development\n \nPractical Experiments \nCome Alive Coaching\n- Start with pro bono trials\n- Partner with professional coaches\n- Document real transformation\n- Build from genuine results\n\nCore Practice Development\n- Identify our true craft\n- Focus on direct value \n- Let natural scale emerge\n- Trust quality recognition\n\nRelationship Restructuring\n- Direct connection with participants\n- Value-based funding relationships\n- Community of practice\n- Natural growth patterns\n\nThe Technology Question\nInstead of forcing platform adoption, technology should:\n- Support human connection\n- Enable natural processes\n- Document real value\n- Scale what works naturally\n\nThis means:\n- Simpler tools\n- Direct support of practice\n- Natural integration\n- Organic growth\n\nMeasuring Success Differently  \nSuccess looks like:\n- Real transformation in participants\n- Sustainable value creation\n- Natural resource flow\n- Community growth\n- Quality recognition development\n\nThis isn't abandoning scale but trusting that: \n- Quality creates natural growth\n- Value attracts resources\n- Beauty spreads organically\n- Wisdom develops naturally\n\nThe key is starting with what's real and valuable, letting genuine craft guide our development rather than forcing growth through artificial means.\n\nPart V: The Path Forward - From Where We Are to Where We're Called\n\nBuilding from Strength\nLooking clearly at our work, we already have powerful elements aligned with this vision:\n\nWhat's Working:\n- Learning Journeys: Custom assessment approach; Personal challenge identification; Individual growth paths\n- Core Practices: Upside-down pyramid methodology; Starting with deeper why; Focus on wellbeing; Breaking out for connection; Relationship building  \n- Community Elements: Cohort connections; Mentor relationships; Peer learning; Reflective practice\n\nNecessary Shifts\nFrom Software-First to Human-First: \n- Technology supports don't leads\n- Community precedes platform\n- Relationship drives development\n- Reflection guides action\n\nFrom Metrics to Meaning:\n- Remove \"habits of success\" language\n- Shift from goals to emergence\n- Transform assessment approach\n- Start with territory, end with maps\n\nFrom Programs to Practice:\n- Coaching as core offering\n- Deep relationship building\n- Master-apprentice model \n- Natural development paths\n\nPractical Next Steps\nImmediate Actions (1-3 months):\n- Launch pilot coaching program\n- Clean language/materials \n- Document current successes\n- Start stakeholder conversations\n\nMedium Term (3-6 months):\n- Validate \"Come Alive\" methodology\n- Develop new funding relationships\n- Create craft-based accelerator model\n- Build natural assessment approach\n\nLong Term Vision:\n- Become transmission line for wisdom\n- Create conditions for emergence \n- Enable natural scale through quality\n- Build true mastery\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nFinding Aligned Partners: \n- Foundations focused on practical spirituality\n- Funders seeking systemic change\n- Partners valuing depth over scale\n- Communities supporting transformation\n\nDemonstrating Value: \n- Share success stories  \n- Show alternative models working\n- Document real transformation\n- Build evidence through practice\n\nCreating New Narratives:\n- From scale to depth\n- From metrics to meaning  \n- From control to emergence\n- From programs to practice\n\nMeasures of Success\nIn 6 months we should see:\nValidated Methodology  \n- Tested coaching approach\n- Clear value proposition\n- Natural payment model  \n- Direct impact evidence\n\nTransformed Relationships\n- Deeper mentor connections\n- Stronger community bonds\n- Aligned funding partners\n- Clear transmission lines\n\nNew Offerings \n- Craft-based accelerator\n- Integrated technology support\n- Quality-centered assessment\n- Natural growth patterns\n\nThe Super Bloom Vision\nInstead of forcing growth, we cultivate conditions where:\n- Beauty emerges naturally\n- Wisdom transfers clearly\n- Community builds organically\n- Impact flows naturally\n\nThis isn't slower - it's aligned with natural timing. Not smaller - but scaled through quality. Not less impactful - but transformative at the root. \n\nThe key is trusting that when we align with quality:\n- Right relationships form\n- Resources flow naturally  \n- Impact emerges organically\n- Beauty spreads naturally\n\nOur role becomes:\n- Creating conditions\n- Supporting emergence\n- Enabling transmission\n- Trusting quality\n\nThis is how we contribute to the super bloom - not by forcing growth but by planting seeds in fertile soil, tending with wisdom, and trusting the natural unfolding of beauty and impact.\n\nThree final questions:\n\n1. How can we most effectively communicate this vision in a way that inspires stakeholders while addressing legitimate concerns around scale, evidence, and feasibility? \n\n2. What specific practices can we implement immediately to start embodying these principles in our day-to-day work, even before making larger structural changes?\n\n3. How will we know we're on the right track? What signs of natural growth and alignment should we look for to validate that this approach is working?\n\nOverall, I believe this essay presents a compelling case for a fundamental shift in how we understand and pursue social impact. It grounds this vision in lived experience, offers concrete models and practices, and charts a path from current reality to future possibility.\n\nThe key will be translating these insights into aligned action - not as a new dogma but as an ongoing practice of wise participation. By staying true to what we already know, while daring to trust the deeper wisdom of quality, beauty, and natural unfolding, we can pioneer a new paradigm for social change.",

            "extracted_content": "The idea that \"how you do anything is how you do everything\" is deeply resonant with what you're saying: it underscores the fact that our approach—our mindset, values, and assumptions—shapes not only our actions but their consequences. If our worldview remains rooted in extraction, control, and domination, simply applying a \"social enterprise\" veneer doesn’t change the deeper dynamics.\n\nHere are examples and stories—both literal and metaphorical—that illustrate how adopting corporate \"best practices\" without addressing underlying mindsets can backfire or undermine the mission of social enterprises or NGOs.\n\nReal-World Examples of NGOs and Social Enterprises Adopting Corporate Practices with Harmful Outcomes\n1. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)\nWhat Happened: Microfinance started as a way to provide small loans to marginalized communities, especially women, to foster entrepreneurship and alleviate poverty. However, as microfinance grew, many institutions began adopting corporate practices such as profit-maximizing goals, aggressive repayment schedules, and loan quotas. This led to exploitative practices like high-interest rates, coercion, and even borrower suicides in some countries (e.g., India).\nKey Lesson: By adopting a corporate mindset focused on financial metrics over the well-being of borrowers, MFIs often undermined the very communities they were meant to uplift.\n2. Charity: Profit-Driven \"Efficiency\" in Disaster Relief\nWhat Happened: In the aftermath of disasters (like Haiti's 2010 earthquake), major NGOs adopted corporate metrics like ROI, donor satisfaction, and visible project completion as priorities. This led to rushed housing projects and poorly planned infrastructure that failed to meet long-term needs or respect local input. Billions of dollars in funding were spent inefficiently, with a focus on pleasing donors rather than building resilient communities.\nKey Lesson: A corporate efficiency mindset that prioritizes measurable outputs over holistic, community-driven outcomes can lead to waste and harm.\n3. Fair Trade's \"Certification Industrial Complex\"\nWhat Happened: The Fair Trade movement started as a way to ensure small farmers received a fair price for their products. Over time, as certification became a corporate tool, the focus shifted to scaling and meeting the demands of large companies. This led to small-scale farmers being excluded from certification schemes due to high costs, and large plantations dominating \"Fair Trade\" markets while still exploiting workers.\nKey Lesson: Adopting a corporate growth mindset can distort the original intention of movements meant to prioritize equity and justice.\n4. Nonprofit \"Professionalization\" and Burnout\nWhat Happened: Many nonprofits have adopted corporate-style hierarchies, productivity measures, and performance-based evaluations to attract funders or improve efficiency. However, this has led to high turnover, employee burnout, and mission drift, as workers feel dehumanized and alienated in organizations meant to be centered on care and social good.\nExample: NGOs like Oxfam and Save the Children have faced scandals where internal cultures mirrored exploitative corporate environments—fostering toxicity, harassment, and ignoring staff well-being.\nKey Lesson: Professionalizing nonprofits by mimicking corporate cultures often ignores the emotional and relational labor required to achieve social missions.\n5. Education Startups and \"Datafication\"\nWhat Happened: EdTech companies and educational NGOs often adopted corporate-style metrics to measure success (e.g., test scores, student performance data). In doing so, they shifted focus from holistic education to data collection and analytics, reducing students to numbers. Programs that aimed to empower students became tools to reinforce standardization and control.\nExample: Bridge International Academies (an NGO-backed for-profit education model) has been criticized for scripted lessons that disempower teachers and rigid metrics that ignore local needs.\nKey Lesson: A corporate mindset of standardization and efficiency clashes with the nuanced, relational work of education.\nMetaphors for Why This Happens\n\"Wearing a New Mask on the Same Face\"\n\nSocial enterprises often adopt the appearance of change (ethical branding, \"impact metrics\") but don’t address the deeper worldview of competition, hierarchy, and control that governs their operations.\n\"Pouring Clean Water into a Dirty Cup\"\n\nA clean and noble idea (e.g., empowering communities) can be tainted when poured into systems designed for extraction and domination. Unless we change the container (our underlying mindset and structures), the result will always be compromised.\n\"Trying to Grow Organic Food in Polluted Soil\"\n\nSocial enterprises may start with good intentions, but if they operate within \"polluted soil\" (systems that reward exploitation and competition), they inherit the toxicity of their environment and cannot thrive.\n\"Teaching Wolves to Herd Sheep\"\n\nTaking corporate best practices (rooted in competitive and extractive principles) and applying them to social enterprises is like teaching wolves to herd sheep: the nature of the system inherently conflicts with the goal.\n\"Upgrading the Chains of a Prison\"\n\nMaking systems more \"efficient\" or \"ethical\" without questioning their fundamental purpose is like replacing the chains in a prison with silk ropes—it might feel better, but it’s still a prison.\nWhy \"Doing Things Differently\" Matters\nThe core insight here is that we cannot use the same worldview that created the problem to solve it. Social enterprises need to:\n\nShift from efficiency to relationship: Efficiency focuses on outputs, while relationships build trust and lasting change.\nReplace competition with cooperation: Moving away from zero-sum thinking to models that value shared growth.\nValue process as much as outcome: Focusing not just on what is done, but how it is done.\nRedefine success: Moving from financial or numerical metrics to metrics of well-being, equity, and ecological balance.\nWould you like help refining a metaphor or crafting a narrative to convey this to social enterprises? Perhaps a story or a parable that illustrates the deeper need for mindset shifts?\n\n16:31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nyeah, can you also get me quotes and turns of phrase from different cultures that say something like this. maybe something that's actually really simple and clear too so i can share it and people can understand \n16:32\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s a collection of metaphors, proverbs, and quotes from various cultures that express the idea that how we do something shapes the results we get, along with their cultural roots. These can help communicate your message in a simple and relatable way:\n\nQuotes and Proverbs That Align with Your Ideas\n\"The way you make your bed is the way you will sleep.\"\n\n(African Proverb)\nMeaning: The approach you take determines the experience you have. It's not just the result that matters, but how you prepare for it.\n\"A crooked tree will never yield straight timber.\"\n\n(English Proverb)\nMeaning: If the foundation or approach is flawed, the outcome will carry those flaws.\n\"As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.\"\n\n(English Proverb)\nMeaning: The way you shape something from the start affects its entire growth or trajectory.\n\"If you cut corners, you'll build a round house.\"\n\n(Caribbean Saying)\nMeaning: Shortcuts or compromises in how you work lead to imperfect or ineffective results.\n\"The water takes the shape of the vessel it fills.\"\n\n(Chinese Proverb)\nMeaning: The nature of the container (mindset or system) defines the outcome, no matter the quality of the content (ideas or intentions).\n\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"\n\n(English Saying)\nMeaning: Even well-meaning actions can cause harm if they are not guided by the right mindset and values.\n\"You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.\"\n\n(English Proverb)\nMeaning: High-quality results cannot come from low-quality methods or materials.\n\"A rotten fish spoils the whole pot.\"\n\n(Indian Proverb)\nMeaning: A single flaw in the foundation can ruin the entire outcome.\n\"The spirit in which you give is more important than the gift itself.\"\n\n(African Proverb)\nMeaning: The intent and way you act determine the true value of your actions.\n\"One cannot plant weeds and hope for wheat.\"\n\n(Middle Eastern Proverb)\nMeaning: The seeds you sow (methods, intentions) determine the harvest.\n\"The pot leaks from where it was poorly sealed.\"\n(Turkish Proverb)\nMeaning: Weak points in the process or system will ultimately lead to failure.\n\"If the root is rotten, the fruit cannot be sweet.\"\n(Chinese Proverb)\nMeaning: A system built on faulty principles will produce flawed outcomes.\n\"You cannot wash blood with blood.\"\n(Indian Proverb)\nMeaning: Using the same destructive methods or mindset to solve a problem only perpetuates harm.\nModern and Philosophical Quotes\n\"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\"\n\n(Albert Einstein)\nMeaning: A new mindset is essential for meaningful change.\n\"The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.\"\n\n(Martin Luther King Jr.)\nMeaning: The process matters as much as the goal; methods that harm cannot lead to justice.\n\"What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.\"\n\n(Ralph Waldo Emerson)\nMeaning: Actions—and the way we take them—define outcomes far more than intentions.\n\"You cannot use fire to put out fire.\"\n\n(Buddhist Teaching)\nMeaning: Using the same destructive mindset to address problems only escalates them.\n\"Be the change that you wish to see in the world.\"\n\n(Mahatma Gandhi)\nMeaning: Aligning actions with values is critical; how we act shapes the outcomes.\n\"The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.\"\n\n(Audre Lorde)\nMeaning: Systems of oppression cannot be reformed with the same tools or mindset that created them.\nSimple and Clear Sayings to Share\n\"You can’t fix a broken system with broken tools.\"\n\"How we walk the path shapes where it leads.\"\n\"What you build reflects how you build it.\"\n\"You can’t grow flowers in poisoned soil.\"\n\"Better maps don’t help if you’re heading in the wrong direction.\"\nStory-Based Metaphors\nThe Poisoned Well\n\nImagine a village whose well becomes poisoned. Instead of replacing the well or finding clean water, the villagers filter the poisoned water through finer and finer sieves, improving its taste but not its health. No matter how good the filtration, the poison remains. This is like trying to make businesses \"better\" without changing the worldview that poisons them.\nThe Broken Compass\n\nA group of travelers keeps getting lost. They try walking faster, carrying more supplies, and even building better shoes, but they never realize their compass is broken. This is like adopting corporate efficiency without questioning the values guiding the work.\nThe Rusty Hammer\n\nA carpenter keeps using a rusty hammer to build houses. No matter how skilled they are, the hammer always leaves nails bent and the wood damaged. It’s not their skill that’s lacking—it’s the tool they refuse to replace. This is like clinging to outdated corporate values in social enterprises.\nWould you like to explore one of these ideas or refine them for your specific audience? I can also help you adapt them into a cohesive message for presentations or conversations!\n\n16:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan you give me more examples of \"doing good gone wrong - because of neoliberal mindsets of extraction disconnection acceleration, etc\"\n16:39\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere are more examples of well-intentioned \"doing good\" efforts that went wrong due to the underlying neoliberal mindset of extraction, disconnection, and acceleration. These illustrate how adopting corporate logic, without questioning its values, often leads to unintended harm:\n\n1. Social Impact Startups in Africa (e.g., One Laptop Per Child)\nWhat Happened: The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program aimed to provide affordable laptops to children in developing countries, believing access to technology would bridge the education gap. However, the program focused on distributing hardware without addressing the local context—schools lacked infrastructure, teachers weren’t trained, and there was no plan to integrate laptops into the curriculum. Many laptops were abandoned or misused.\nThe Problem: The initiative adopted a \"tech-savior\" mindset, focusing on acceleration and scalability without understanding the local systems or fostering connection with communities.\nLesson: Doing good requires slowing down to build relationships and understand real needs, not just imposing top-down solutions.\n2. Carbon Offsetting Programs\nWhat Happened: Many companies and NGOs offer carbon offset programs to reduce the environmental impact of industries. These often involve planting trees or funding renewable energy projects. However, these programs are frequently used to justify continued emissions (greenwashing), and many tree-planting projects fail due to poor planning or lack of follow-up, leading to degraded ecosystems.\nThe Problem: The neoliberal logic of \"offsetting\" turns sustainability into a transactional system rather than addressing root causes of overconsumption and industrial emissions.\nLesson: Genuine sustainability cannot be achieved through compensatory mechanisms alone; it requires systemic change.\n3. \"Green Revolution\" in Agriculture\nWhat Happened: The Green Revolution in the mid-20th century introduced high-yield crops, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to combat global hunger. While it increased food production, it also led to soil degradation, water scarcity, and dependency on chemical inputs. Small farmers were often driven into debt by the costs of seeds and chemicals, deepening inequality.\nThe Problem: The logic of extraction and acceleration—focusing on maximizing output without considering long-term ecological or social impacts—undermined the goals of sustainability and equity.\nLesson: Approaches that prioritize short-term efficiency over holistic well-being often create more harm than good.\n4. Fast Fashion and \"Conscious\" Collections\nWhat Happened: Companies like H&M introduced \"conscious\" collections to promote sustainability in the fashion industry. However, these collections make up a tiny fraction of their output, while the overall business model remains based on overproduction, low wages, and disposable clothing. The marketing of these collections gives consumers a false sense of doing good while perpetuating exploitative practices.\nThe Problem: Neoliberal capitalism’s drive for growth and speed clashes with the slower, more connected processes required for genuine sustainability.\nLesson: Without addressing the root problem—overproduction and exploitation—efforts to \"do good\" become performative.\n5. Volunteer Tourism (\"Voluntourism\")\nWhat Happened: Volunteer tourism offers travelers the chance to help disadvantaged communities while vacationing. However, many programs focus on providing feel-good experiences for volunteers rather than creating sustainable change. For instance, volunteers might build schools that later remain empty because no teachers are hired or trained.\nThe Problem: The disconnection between volunteers and the communities they serve—paired with an extractive, profit-driven tourism model—turns \"helping\" into a commodity that benefits volunteers more than locals.\nLesson: True change requires deep, sustained relationships and co-created solutions, not transactional acts of \"help.\"\n6. NGOs Perpetuating Dependency\nWhat Happened: Many humanitarian aid organizations unintentionally foster long-term dependency by providing relief without investing in community-driven solutions. For example, constant food aid in some regions has disrupted local agricultural markets, making it harder for farmers to compete.\nThe Problem: A mindset of disconnection and top-down \"rescue\" treats communities as passive recipients rather than active participants, undermining self-sufficiency.\nLesson: Social enterprises and NGOs must shift from paternalism to partnership, fostering empowerment rather than dependency.\n7. Plastic Recycling Initiatives\nWhat Happened: Global plastic recycling campaigns have emphasized individual responsibility for waste while failing to address the systemic problem of overproduction by corporations. Studies show that only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, yet the focus remains on consumers to \"do their part.\"\nThe Problem: The neoliberal mindset offloads responsibility onto individuals, disconnecting systemic accountability (corporations) from the problem of plastic pollution.\nLesson: Environmental initiatives must challenge corporate production patterns rather than placing the burden on consumers.\n8. Corporate \"Diversity and Inclusion\" Programs\nWhat Happened: Many companies implement diversity and inclusion programs to address workplace inequities. However, these programs are often surface-level, focusing on optics rather than structural change. For example, hiring more diverse employees without addressing toxic workplace cultures leads to high turnover among underrepresented groups.\nThe Problem: The mindset of acceleration and optics treats diversity as a checkbox rather than a systemic transformation.\nLesson: Equity requires slow, deliberate shifts in culture and power, not quick-fix programs.\n9. The Privatization of Public Services\nWhat Happened: Under neoliberal reforms, public services like water, education, and healthcare have been privatized in many countries, often with promises of increased efficiency. In reality, privatization has often led to reduced access, higher costs, and worsening inequality, especially in vulnerable communities.\nThe Problem: Applying corporate logic to essential services treats people as customers rather than citizens with rights, prioritizing profit over access and equity.\nLesson: Public goods cannot be treated as market commodities without undermining their purpose.\n10. Tech in the Classroom: Overuse of EdTech\nWhat Happened: Many schools adopted digital learning tools to \"modernize\" education, often driven by tech companies rather than educators. These tools frequently prioritized data collection and standardization over meaningful learning. Studies show that excessive screen use can harm students’ focus and engagement while deepening digital divides for low-income schools.\nThe Problem: The acceleration mindset prioritizes technological solutions over understanding human learning processes, resulting in harm to students.\nLesson: Technology should serve human needs, not dictate them.\nKey Patterns in \"Doing Good Gone Wrong\"\nAcross these examples, the underlying neoliberal mindsets lead to:\n\nDisconnection – Treating people and ecosystems as resources or beneficiaries rather than partners or equals.\nExtraction – Prioritizing measurable outputs (profits, metrics, growth) over relational or long-term well-being.\nAcceleration – Seeking quick fixes or scalable models instead of slower, context-specific, relational solutions.\nWould you like to explore any of these stories in greater detail, or craft a narrative or metaphor to help explain this to your audience?\n\n16:47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\n\"The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.\" \"What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.\"\n\nI want as m any quotes about this topic and tangential topics as you can find, these are great and more philosophy underneath it about ontology and comology and self perception and how societies with differences have different results, do we have examples from the world about that?\n16:48\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nCertainly, here are additional quotes and philosophical insights that delve into the relationship between means and ends, as well as perspectives on ontology, cosmology, and self-perception:\n\nMeans and Ends\nJohn Dewey: \"The end is the means by which you achieve it. Today's step is tomorrow's life.\" \nA-Z QUOTES\n\nAldous Huxley: \"Great is truth, but still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth.\" \nGOODREADS\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche: \"In art the end does not sanctify the means: but sacred means employed here can sanctify the end.\" \nA-Z QUOTES\n\nOntology and Self-Perception\nWillard Van Orman Quine: \"Our acceptance of an ontology is, I think, similar in principle to our acceptance of a scientific theory... we adopt... the simplest conceptual scheme into which the disordered fragments of raw experience can be fitted and arranged.\" \nA-Z QUOTES\n\nImmanuel Kant: \"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.\" \nDAILY PHILOSOPHY\n\nCosmology and Worldview\nJohn Polkinghorne: \"On scientific grounds this big bang assumption is much less the palatable of the two. For it is an irrational process that cannot be described in scientific terms... On philosophical grounds too I cannot see any good reason for preferring the big bang idea.\" \nA-Z QUOTES\nPhilosophical Perspectives on Self and Society\nSocrates: \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\"\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche: \"To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.\" \nHAPPIER HUMAN\n\nKurt Vonnegut: \"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\" \nHIGHEXISTENCE\n\nCultural Perspectives on Self-Perception and Society\nPlatonism vs. Aristotelianism: Plato emphasized unchanging ideals beyond the physical realm, suggesting a static view of identity. In contrast, Aristotle focused on change and development, viewing the self as a dynamic work in progress. \nTHE ATLANTIC\nThese perspectives highlight how different ontological and cosmological views influence self-perception and societal outcomes. Societies emphasizing static identities may experience rigidity, while those embracing change and development may foster adaptability and growth.\n\nIf you would like to explore any of these concepts further or need more specific examples, feel free to ask!\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\n\n\n16:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nhere are some of mythoughts, can you seee what i'm getting at, can you align some quotes from my talk with quotes from others and tell me what is a clear way to talk about what i'm sharing here: \"\"\"\n \n00:00:00 SPK_1\nI've only seen.\n\n00:00:01 SPK_2\nRemind me in France. Right, but what city before? Yeah, that's true. Have you been. You were traveling, right, last week.\n\n00:00:13 SPK_1\nWhere did I go? I went to Spain at some point and.\n\n00:00:19 SPK_2\nYeah, that's true.\n\n00:00:20 SPK_1\nBeen back for some time. But also.\n\n00:00:22 SPK_2\nHave you been. You were traveling, right, last week.\n\n00:00:24 SPK_1\nDo some deep work on some, some things that I've been thinking about. And it's really interesting because it's related a little bit to the conversation that we're having. I realized that I didn't have such a good grasp of what's missing in this whole change maker scene. Social impact, social entrepreneurship. And so I decided that I would kind of like really dig in deep to, to, to see like initially, first, just within myself, like, what truth can I unearth here? Because I've been feeling really weird about like, metrics and measures and I. And it sounds weird, right? But like, I have a feeling like the same thing that causes people's lives to just be numbers and other people's lives to be full stories is related to this metrics thing. It's related to this mechanized, quantified way of the world where they're like, oh, it's just 18,000 just. Right. And this, this like, idea of the not realizing, like the immensity of what a human is because of not acknowledging. And I know it's going to sound really abstract, okay. So I need to find a better way of talking about this. But the fact that we, most people, I think, can agree that things have quality and quantity and we're like completely disconnected from the quality side of things. And, you know, people, you know, maybe even if you first try to like, push on this, they might say, yeah, so like, love. Yeah. There's biological and evolutionary pressures that cause. And there's like this reductionist kind of worldview because nobody can just say no. Like, I have another type of perception that's just as real and valid and it's internal and it's just as real and valid to do science on this and to find what is meaningful for me and to be able to be more clear about articulating that so we can, we can actually connect with this way of seeing. Right? And that we have a whole, like, perceptive apparatus that is being ignored, that is the source of what makes things meaningful, not countable. And I know it sounds. Probably sounds like super, super abstract. And so I'm trying to come up with a way of not being so. Well, not being so, like, uneasy, like, I don't know what's going on like, why is this so weird? And then, of course, there's a history. There's a history of like, Descartian dualism and Galileo trying to create a way of describing the world with mathematics. Even Galileo, though, when he, when he did that, he did say, like, and there's quality, of course, but for everything else, you know, all you need is like, size, shape and position, velocity, you know, but, but people just decided for pressures and materialism leading to capitalism leading to. So I really see it, like, having a long historic precedence. And it's, it's related to kind of some of the tensions that I see in, in the space that we're working on where, like, there's, I have a feeling, like we can, we can reach all the SDGs and hate our lives, you know, which is, which just sounds weird. But, yeah, this is what I, what I took the last week to do. And I've been trying to turn, like, come up with the next stage of what a social impact program does that includes this realization in a way that's acceptable and digestible and not super abstract. And I'm calling, I'm calling it coming Alive. And the idea of making micro experiments to reconnect with our sense of meaning and quality that brings us to life and enthusiasm and agency. And it's sort of trying to operationalize that quote. It's like, don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come to life and go do that? Because the world needs people that have come alive. And I'm trying to also determine, like, the veracity of that. Like, why is that feel true? Why does it feel true and sound true and come up with kind of a, A theory of, you know, a way of being, a theory of being that still we can measure. But the idea that I'm starting to realize is measurement should happen the end of the day, the beginning of the day. We should ask, what would make today feel complete? How can I come to life today? And then it changes everything about, like, how do we, how do we organize businesses? Like, people have different things that make them come to life and for different reasons and through different contexts, can we create the right context? What if we started measuring instead of, like measures? We're looking into meaningful moments per month per employee. Right? And we're optimizing for that. Like, can you imagine? It's just. Anyway, so I'm, I'm really, just really shifting my thinking and I'm hoping that Bloom, the rest of the team will be able to comprehend what I'm saying and why it's so foundational in terms of, you know, this whole like especially just the social impact space, you know. But I also think it's is good for everyone in our lives to reconnect with what I think makes us human. But if people are so shy to talk about it because it reeks of religion and spirituality, Woo woo stuff. And, and so I've actually started doing research and it turns out that there is a lot of people doing research on, on this idea of gestalt. Like before awareness, before conscious awareness, people have qualitative experience and they're, they're trying to figure out how can we actually measure that with our, with our scientific apparatus, which kind of implies a lot of weird stuff about perception, right? Like we're not a machine, like seeing and then analyzing and then interpreting and then thinking and then speaking. There's something else that we have that is super foundational that can. I think once people realize that it's, it's possible to also look into it scientifically, I think it's going to hopefully just open some doors to. My idea is just to like make it a series of micro experiments. Like what if you trusted this perception of meaning, you know, or your heart or whatever you want to call it and just like keep track, like, does it lead to a better life? Does it have better outcomes? In my work, like just, you know, think about it and then hopefully at some point people are like, wow, yeah, this is actually better. That's my hope. Sorry, I went off on a little bit of rants, but I've been really.\n\n00:07:13 SPK_2\nNo, no, like a whole interesting and, and super relevant I think, because I do think, yeah, it connects a lot to what we're also trying to explore. And this idea of, yeah, making meaning, creating shared meaning, but based on what, you know, what values, what are the drivers of this shared meaning and what is the vision for a more as we're framing it, kind of resilient community that values humanity rather than kind of productivity. And actually I have these conversations, I have this conversation all the time with my husband. My husband is an economist, does like macroeconomic analysis, blah, blah, blah. And he's always saying, oh, you got, you lefties. You always see the world as like this horrid place. But when you look at the data, you know, people are so much better off than they've ever been in the history of mankind, right? You look at the indicators in terms of, you know, GDP per capita, in terms of level of education, life expectancy, and that is all true, but also true that people Are not. Okay.\n\n00:08:30 SPK_1\nCombine that with the rate of change of teenage suicide and the sudden appearance, the miraculous, like, insane thing of pr. Preteen suicides. Okay, Just like, put those together and think about it. Economist.\n\n00:08:45 SPK_2\nExactly. And just this feeling that people just feel really alienated from. From the community. Like, there's lack of the sense of community from the. The States. And again, it doesn't matter whether the data tells them that they're better off than people were before them. It's not, you know, it. It does not fulfill.\n\n00:09:10 SPK_1\nYeah.\n\n00:09:10 SPK_2\nThat.\n\n00:09:11 SPK_1\nYou know, I think there's a. There's like, this interesting perceptual shift that is happening because we've been told since the 50s that heaven is tomorrow. And we're getting there through science, through technology. Heaven is tomorrow. Heaven is tomorrow. And as long as we were making some kind of progress and like, heaven felt like it was coming, and it's related to the. The dopaminergic system. So dopamine isn't a reward drug. It's an anticipation of reward. And so as long as, like, we have these breadcrumbs of heaven is tomorrow, people were willing to play the game, right. I think up until, like, the millennial age, like, this promise kind of held true. It's not so much holding true, and it's. And this is the reason why it's breaking down, I think. Or there's more frustration. There's more quiet quitting. There's more like, hell, no, I won't go. And the thing is, the replacement for that is a life of continual growth. And, you know, I try not to use words like even heart or soul when I'm speaking about these things. But, you know, I think this idea of exploring a way of being that you have this sense of pride in at the end of the day. And that way of being can constantly evolve as your context changes where you are, like, what is demanded of me. That is beautiful in this context, right? And. And every day things change. And so this idea of heaven is tomorrow is sort of heaven. You. You, you are heavenifying. And tomorrow can be better within your own locus of control, right? And if you do that, and if we encourage others to do that by, by setting examples, right? Like, there's an. There's a reason why everyone has heard of Martin Luther King and Gandhi and Mother Teresa and all these, all these people, because they sort of exemplify a way of being that we, we look up to, that is expansive, that actually creates this sense of we can be better, right? And there. Gives us this hope. But the idea I'd like to be able to share is you can be better and every day we can make that progress. And so I'm turning it into a coaching program. I'm just calling it Come Alive. And the way I'm operationalizing it is we look at our to do lists and there's a bunch of have to dos which are often related to maintaining the status quo, the system, the perception that other people have. Those are called like instrumental, right? It's like I do this so that I can party on the weekends or I do this so that my boss doesn't judge me. So that. And there's a bunch of have to's. You can call them instrumental. And then there's some things that if we're lucky, we have to do because we want to do. It's like the want to's. And then this is the idea of being able to explain or understand our values better is by going through this prioritization process. This is where it connects to the whole social impact change makers. Because in training, you know, the whole idea of like being able to prioritize, you make a matrix or like was Eisenhower matrix or something. Right. But the question I think could be really interesting is what are the tensions that appear when you look at your to do list and then analyze the emotions? Because emotions in a framework that I'm building off of from one of my friends, Joe Edelman, are examples of ways of being or these want tos or what he calls constitutive attentional policies. Like ways that are ends in and of themselves. You can see how they're being blocked. So an emotion is pointing at ways of being or things that you value that are being blocked. Uh, and if this is clear, there's a way of kind of reconfiguring things or looking at things differently or designing them differently, asking yourself either what ways of being in my past might make more sense here that would be able to help address this block or what, what do role models that I admire, like what ways of being do they have that might be able to show how to. How, how they might address this challenge? Or the third one is, it's called creative grappling, is just looking at it, for instance, being with my baby or hyper focusing on this like thesis that I'm trying to develop about quality and ways of being. Right. And I actually was using my framework to try to understand like what is a way of. That I can actually find a higher order way of being that manages both. And so it could be as simple as like going for a walk with my baby while talking to myself, basically. Anyway, this is, this is the framework I'm developing. But the nice thing is the only thing we're doing is looking at a to do list, trying to prioritize and sensing our. How we feel about that. Because priorities, people don't really realize. What it means is you have to know what matters to you, which is hard. And it means you have to know yourself. You have to know what matters. It's actually a big deal. So the whole framework, the whole beginning, the whole thing can just be, okay, let's look at our to do lists. And they say, show me your to do list and I'll tell you who you are. And I think this kind of ratio between, like instrumental versus constitutive or, you know, have to's or one twos, let's just call it that is. Is like a really good way about thinking about the good life for oneself. But then you're talking about, how do we do this with each other and what does that mean? And I think that just being more articulate, you know, where does it go? Carl Jung, he goes, until you make the unconscious, conscious patterns will run your life and you'll call it fate. And so I think there's a lot of have to's that no one's actually looking at. Like, I just talked. I was doing some coaching as trial runs with some friends, and my friend yesterday was telling me, like, I have to call my mom, but I'm tired at night. And I just, like, we just, like, I just literally held up the mirror and he was like, wait a second. But I love my mom, and I have energy in the morning, and I've always wanted to wake up earlier. Why don't I just wake up earlier and call my mom? And I'm like, I fixed his life. You know, like, not I, but like this mirror, this just. Just looking at these tensions and being more clear about, you know, who we are in our lives and how we're showing up now and how we want to show up. And the difference between these two things can, can kind of open these doors for people. And. And then once you have that clarity, I think you're talking about what are values that we can align on. I don't think we. I want to, like, use words like honesty or justice or social justice. Like, I think these, these aren't clear enough. And so I can share with you Joe's paper, but what he calls them are attentional policies. And essentially the way that I think of Them is we. We all have, like, these funny little shapes configured by our upbringing, our natural inclinations, our way of life, our family, all of our experiences. And, like, you can think of it as like, a vessel, and a situation will happen, and it will kind of reverberate the. The vessel, and you'll be able to see what your attention points at. If you've ever seen a movie that you found really moving and you, like, talk to everybody's like, I love this part. And you realize, like, different people love different parts for different reasons. Right? But so being able to be that explicit, like my configuration, my, like, funny shape meant that I resonated with. I don't know, like, the.\n\n00:16:56 SPK_2\nThe.\n\n00:16:56 SPK_1\nThe openness that the characters presented to each other when they were, like, dealing with a difficult moment or somebody else might say, like, I love being transported by, like, the music that just elevated me. Right. And these are more closely aligned with what I might. What. What Joe calls values. Like, the person that, like, values kind of aesthetics. Right. And that. That being transported. And you can. You can combine these clusters that are related to a moment and call it a source of meaning. And I think maybe shifting from this idea of, like, values and connecting on this idea of values which has still almost like a capitalist or, like, financial. Like, how much does this value? You know, like, this value versus, like, a source of meaning which we can align on and we can say, okay, well, I actually also really like that source of meaning. I didn't resonate with that part in the movie, but I understand. Yo, like, if I was in your configuration or your headspace, like, if I studied music enough to know the complexity of that guitar piece, I might really appreciate it too. Because the person can say, I really appreciate virtuosic complexity that results in a transcendent, like, piece that, like, moves people. Right? But I didn't know it was complicated, so I wasn't able to see what you saw. But when you describe what you saw and you tell me why it was meaningful in a clearer way, I'm like, hell, yeah. That's a cool piece. Maybe I should learn more about guitar. Okay, sorry. I've been. Like, when you. When you ask where I was for the last week, I've been thinking and reflecting in, like, monk mode almost 24 7. So I'm. I'm a little bit full of words. I need to get it out into the words. Sorry about that.\n\n00:18:38 SPK_2\nNo, I love it. And yeah, if you have stuff, like, stuff that you've mentioned that you could share with us just for you know, our own reading. I think it's. It's really interesting. I would love to read out more about it as well, because I do. Yeah, it really resonates in the sense. Obviously I haven't thought about it in as much detail as you have, but it's definitely something that I've been thinking about that we've been thinking about at Envy and that we want. We do want to explore further. And again, I do think that that's kind of how we had envisioned this fellowship and heard summit as well. We're talking about it in terms of more traditional terms as like, countering polarization, creating shared meaning. D. But the sense is really about kind of questioning, you know, the system and how we're operating and relating to each other and to our society right now and thinking about what are other ways that we can do it that feel more aligned with our main values or meaning, however we want to frame that. Yeah. And. And that are also better for, you know, for our communities and for the world, for nature, for, you know, the planet and so on.\n\n00:20:04 SPK_1\nYeah. So, yeah, I think a big part of the way I think about things is, you know, I've always was using things. So at some point I was like, open source technology to make the world better. And I was using like, you know, technology. And then I was like, oh, no, but it needs to be configured in a space in a way that's actually good. Right. And so I was thinking, okay, social enterprises that use technology for this change. Right. And then I was like, oh, no, but like, if people can't manage their teams, and so we need this, like, this management element and like, if people can't manage themselves and their emotions. And so then we added on this element of like, yeah, so personal and professional growth to be able to operationalize, social enterprises to be able to use technology to be able to make the world. And I was using personal growth. Right. And then I finally realized, like, why these, like, all these things. There was like, this progression and at some point I realized, like, we just need to stop using things and start, like, connecting more with. With a way of being. So even for myself, like, I want to be an author someday. I have this, like, kind of goal. I would. Something that I think would be meaningful for me to be able to hold a book, right. And feel like I shared something that mattered to me in a way that's digestible. Maybe it's making an impact in people's lives. It would be really inspiring. But what I think it would be, like, how I want to approach that is what ways of being lead to a book emerging from me, rather than thinking, how can I, like, get my word count in right? Which then I'm using myself for an end, rather than becoming the kind of thing that makes the things that I want to happen or that I would be inspired to see in my life possible. Right? And then you become more of a gardener. I think this is one of the other analogies I started using. It's like you garden yourself, like, you plant the right seeds, you. You kind of set the right context, and then you want the fruit. Like, everyone wants SDGs and wants depolarization and wants all of these things. And I think, did I ever tell you that story about, like, a cow that the farmer is trying to push into a barn, right? And he's like, pushing and pushing, and here's the masculine energy, big muscles, he's like, yellow. The cow get in the barn, it's late. And then the farmer's wife comes and then puts out her thumb, and the cow starts sucking her thumb and she walks, and the cow walks with her to the barn. And I feel like we are pushing into the SDGs or depolarization or like, oh, my God, the world is ending. We must act fast and act now and urgence, right? And yeah, there's. There's many reasons why that probably creates more problems than. Than solutions. Partially in my life, just like, very simply, when I'm in a rush, like, I break things, you know, I'm not able to attend to everything. It's just, just like even a small example. And so the, The. The difficult and hard thing to do is what is it? Times are urgent. We have to slow down. I think we have to, like, really slow down. And then the second thing I think we really need to do is in that place of slowness, realize that alienation where it comes from that long history, and just like slowly reconnect with that part of us that knows what to do, what. What beauty actually is, what truth actually is, and to allow that to enter into the world through us by removing these blocks and these tensions between want to's and have to's and then seeing if it's giving us the fruit that we want, actually want, right? Like, one of the most transformative things I think can be for the entire world is contentedness. Contentedness. Can you imagine if more people were content and they weren't buying fast fashion and they weren't using women or men or they weren't like, you know, angry about whatever, right? Like Just what does it take for you to be content? And I don't. It's often because of all of these want tos, all these things are externalized to see to, to others. Like I want to like have my own job and that person's taking my job and da da da. Like and there's this competitive nature versus anyway there's I think a lot of change and I don't think I want to think of this as like I want to change the world. But for me, I'm realizing especially for my work and the way that I see things, I've been feeling more and more of this like weird tension between funders and fundees and like impact and like it was really the seed of. It was when I saw how many women programs popped up the day after USAID was like, hey, like we want to fund female tech programs in Iraq. And suddenly there was like a million of them. And I felt like, sure, like people need jobs and stuff but doesn't authenticity matter? Like maybe some of them are authentic and they just needed the opportunity. That would be, that's wonderful. And we, I'm not saying we shouldn't have those programs but that like started getting me wondering like can we actually get good results with inauthentic means? And what is authenticity? And then kind of like backtracking all the way to. There's a difference between quantity and quality and we can actually access that quality to see what wants to emerge and, and it can become simpler. Like I used to have so many frameworks, right? Like there's the inner development goals and the. What is it the ecats and, and all of these things. And I think the, the, the, the less I want to do. Like I don't think we need so many frameworks to try to model where people are in the world and how they want to go. Because I sort of like foundationally believe that it's possible for people to learn and discover and access resources, but to be able to create kind of a context for that to happen and to help them do that for themselves through of like a very, very simple process. Because everything is talking to us. The wars. You know, for me it's, it's a one person network, distant. How is it possible that I don't perceive it in my gestalt or in that thing inside of me that knows, right? How is it possible that I don't know climate change when I'm coughing up like stuff right now, like the, you know, the forces at play, we are on one planet, they do show up. And so that's kind of the theory of like why is this gonna lead to right action? It's. It requires two stories to be built. The story of self and the story of world. And as long as people are doing that and also touching with this quality and asking why and what shall I do in response, I think there's a beautiful way to. Even if like the end result is it's far too late and we're not going to be able to address things at least the quality of break. You know that movie like 300 or something about those like braves. Yeah, we still love that story. Those people probably, you know, inshallah, they, they died happy. And so how can we die happy, you know, even if we know that this is the end. Right. And I think it's really about like tuning in to that, to this idea and realizing that success can be every step. When your question is what is the most meaningful and beautiful way I can show up with my story of self and the story of the world that I'm holding right now and then that will uncover more story and, and so on. So yeah, that's my, my flip of impact and we'll see. I just shared it with Dar on Munir yesterday and I'm worried they're gonna think I'm such a hippie, you know.\n\n00:27:26 SPK_2\nBut you know like we've. So we have these a lot of similar conversations actually and in our work as an organization we've. We moved a lot from where we first started which was more I guess unnecessarily that it was donor driven but it was all like kind of capacity building and yeah, so we're going to empower CSOs and we're going to give them these tools and, and because then they're going to go out into the world and do all these good things and then we're like okay, but wait, we're giving them all these tools. But then what they're doing is not necessarily what we would consider to be meaningful or impactful. You know, they're not inclusive of different communities. They're only promoting this particular sector of society or they're still competitive amongst each other and not really like creating again shared meaning for more systemic change and so on and so forth. And it was all like we had great numbers, you know, to show our donors in terms of number of people trained and then sub grants given and what they've done, what, you know, their targets looked beautiful but it felt meaningless to us. It didn't. We were not connecting to it. Anymore. It felt inauthentic. And we decided to like, okay, no, let's stop and let's only do the stuff that we actually care about and that we think is meaningful. And that meant that for like one year, half of the team was on furlough because we like basically gave up on our usual, you know, funding. But and we focused on just one or two projects that, that we thought, you know, this is, this is the stuff that we think is actually meaningful and this is the stuff that leads to transformative learning and actual change. And then we started rebuilding from that. And so all of our work now is focused on that. Precisely. And we've had, we've been lucky enough that some of our partners, the ones that have been with us for a long time, like understand that, but many others. And that's why we've kind of, we've just lost one of our donors that are like, you know, we love it, we understand it, but headquarters think you're a fucking bunch of hippies, you know, because, you know, it's, it's really hard. Again, we were talking about in terms of measuring impact, it's a lot less, it's way less quantitative and way more qualitative in a way that we can't really communicate it. Like, we know, we see it, the.\n\n00:30:05 SPK_1\nCharts aren't the same. Where are the charts?\n\n00:30:08 SPK_2\nExactly. So, yeah, it's a lot harder to sell.\n\n00:30:14 SPK_1\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, it is a really interesting and difficult place. I, I, I feel for you. And you know, it's, it's so, so interesting that people so often like ask for these charts that no one does anything with, but they just like the fact that they exist. Right. Because it's a way of sort of proving that you've done something. And the only way that the world can align on these days because of whatever the 30 years wars and all the religious issues and the fact that we can't actually talk about the qualitative. Like people poo poo these things all the time, right? Like it's like it's meaningless and we'll see. I'm not sure how this whole thing about money too, like, how did this like materialism and reductionist approaches that view humans as resources and the natural world as resources for the economy. Cruel of this kind of point system of money is the reason why like certain places have this resource that, you know, in the setup that we currently have, we need to eat and feel safe and to have a home and heating and you know, air filters for when the pollution that is caused by the economic system tries to creep in through the windows. And, and so, so we're trying to do things in that context where it's, it's actually coming from the. The other. It's not that like, these are. One is better than the other, but they're not, they're not balanced. There's one that's completely obliterated. And even it's embarrassing to, to point at like that. You have a faculty of direct observation of quality, of a moment, of a gestalt, like this whole. And that's where your sense of meaning comes from. And like, you can actually connect with that to realize it's a source of perception, to show you how you should actually live. That would be more meaningful and beautiful, but it would have to be put into balance and viewed alongside your quantified, you know, worldview. And it might mean that you might make some changes. And so it's so scary. It's like blocked, right? It's like, no. You know, and yeah, part of me doing all this thinking was like, man, we really should start a. Make a farm. And you know.\n\n00:32:41 SPK_2\nBut see, that's, that's how I don't like, that's the one thing that kind of pisses me off a little is that people that end up speaking like that, like, thinking this way, then they end up like, creating their own commune somewhere and kind of retreating from the world. And I think you need to stay engaged in the world if you're. I don't know. Yeah, I guess it's.\n\n00:33:01 SPK_1\nI think the gradient shift is not the. Like, it'll take a while for even people that begin the exploration to think the way that I do. And gradually within their organizations, as their to do lists move more from want tos, from have to's to want tos, the organization will change, right? Like, if more people within the organization do that, the way that it makes money will still be consistent. And like there's a way of gradually shifting, like, personally and organizationally and through different organizations that provide like, the foundations for. For life. And also like the way that I sometimes I like, I think a little bit, yeah, like, it can be a gradient. You know, it doesn't have to be this one size fits all thing. But I, I do think that, you know, especially the little parts of you that squeaks when you try to live in an authentic way and you're losing another funder or whatever. Like, we definitely have like this Maslow's hierarchy of needs. And one of the reasons we maintain social approval is because we think there's, like, a survival element, and we're afraid, right? If you really dig down into it. And so, like, we need to, like, throw it. Throw that part of us a bone somehow. I don't know, like, what. What it might be, but it could be, I don't know, like, a savings account or. Or a friend that, like, tells you, like, hey, listen, like, if anything ever goes really, we have a guest room. You're more than welcome. You can stay, like, three months. I used to do this thing called the care contract where I would tell friends that were at the edge of following their hearts doing something ridiculous that doesn't make financial sense. I would say, like, listen, like, go do that. Here's a care contract. You can come live with me. Like, I'm gonna be, you know, after you come crashing through the ceiling, I'm gonna be the bed that you can land on. Okay? You'll have a bed, and I'll feed you. That's it. Nothing else. But if that's okay, can you fly now? You know, and the idea of, like, what is that foundation? And it's gonna be different for different people, right? Like, some people might even have come from wealthy families. And that's not actually a part of the concern, but, like, image is a concern. How can we address the image part? And so, yeah, yeah, this idea of, like, giving. Giving the space for that, following your heart, in short, requires actually looking at why these tensions emerge and giving some grounding. Yeah, the farm thing was like a. Like a silly example, but, like, for me, I think, yeah, some. I think there's a way of. I call it, like, vicarious meaning. When you look at the jobs that you have to do potentially to make money, to survive within a system so you can sustain these things. If you can have deep intentionality and presence and reflection in the moment of choice for doing this, I think it can help turn a have to do into at least a kind of want to do right. It's like, I know why I'm doing right. Maybe there's three. There's the have to's, the want to's. I know why I'm doing right, and we want to move at least into the middle for more of our actions. Yeah.\n\n00:36:21 SPK_2\nSo we've done actually, a bit of. Sorry, go ahead.\n\n00:36:23 SPK_3\nNo, I was gonna say that about what you said regarding the whole farm situation and all that, actually. One of the podcasts from the Heart Summit that I heard from, I think it was the one that they did in Cal. It was this girl or lady talking about how she actually does use that as a. As a resource, the whole, like, going farming and creating, like a rural community and all of that. And she got a lot of messages from people asking her, like, how do you. How do you contribute to shifting this mindset amongst others, like, is there a retreat that I can join or is there a Facebook group? And she was like, yes. I mean, you can, but also start with your neighbor. Like, you can also do this starting, by the way, to your neighbor in your building in the city where you live. Like, you don't have to go to, you know, rural Thailand to do something like that. So I think that's very much ingrained in. In the. In the ethos of the. Of the hearth. And the other thing that. That you made me think about, Bilal, was I saw this exhibition. I don't remember if it was in Paris, but it was this French artist who. So it was in our contemporary art museum. And then the whole exhibition was about, like, project projectors that projected numbers in the walls, and they were just like random numbers, you know, so, like, you enter the thing and they were like numbers that. Because we are shaped in a way where we think that numbers are valuable in themselves and important in themselves, it felt like something like, oh, this is a very important thing. But the whole purpose of the exhibition was to say that we are. We have been, like, kind of like brainwashed to think that a number, because it's a number, it's valuable in itself. And these numbers didn't have any meaning, any sense. And so, yeah, it was. It was very interesting to see. It's like a critique to the scientification and like numberization, I don't know how to call it, but of. Of information and of knowledge. And so why. Why is it just because it's a number, it's important. Like, you know, so, yeah, I'm going to try to remember the artist.\n\n00:38:28 SPK_1\nThat's very interesting. It reminds me of. So I do some coding sometimes and. And I was getting, like, a framework that can make charts. And at some point I just remember, like, my feeling of, like, putting in this, like, framework plugin thing into my code and then seeing charts and then just feeling like, a sense of accomplishments and relief. Like, wow. Up and to the right.\n\n00:38:54 SPK_2\nWow.\n\n00:38:55 SPK_1\nA full pie chart. You know, Like, I was like, this makes no sense. This is like template data, right? But the fact that it was like my page with, like, some words about the things that I'm doing with some charts on it that were template data, I was like, wow, random. But it Feels good. It's very interesting. Yeah.\n\n00:39:19 SPK_2\nThat's so funny.\n\n00:39:20 SPK_1\nTry it one day. Try it. Like, here, take your journal. Okay. And then cut out like a pie chart from a newspaper or magazine and then tape it by your journal text. I swear, that page, you're gonna feel like, oh, yeah, January 22nd. That was a good day. Pie chart, something like that.\n\n00:39:41 SPK_2\nThat's so funny.\n\n00:39:45 SPK_1\nYeah.\n\n00:39:47 SPK_2\nYeah. Anyways, Bilal, so what we wanted to talk.\n\n00:39:51 SPK_1\nOh, yeah, Abid, how did that go?\n\n00:39:57 SPK_2\nYeah, I mean. But honestly, like, I love this conversation and I think it's a. It's a. It's really helpful to us as well, right, Julie? Food for thought. And I think, again, as we were saying, connects really well to what we're thinking around the summit and. And I think helps us deepen the thought process as well. So I really appreciate you sharing with us. But so just to give you kind of a quick update on how. How things are going in general and. And specifically our meeting with Abdul Rahman, who's lovely. So we are still. So basically, I'm like, trying to reach out to everybody and anybody. I have a couple of, like, concept papers out, waiting for responses. Because I told you, right. I'm trying. If possible, I would love to do this through grants rather than corporate sponsorships because I think that would change really kind of the, you know, what we're able to do and the ethos. And like, I would rather not have, you know, branding all over the place. Like, I would prefer, if possible, for it to be kind of a. A corporate free space. But I. I mean, I don't know yet if that is feasible or not. But that is like my plan A, which has. Which I'm currently working towards. So have.\n\n00:41:21 SPK_1\nHave there been so far. Yeah. What's the. The progress report on?\n\n00:41:26 SPK_2\nLike, not great. Yeah. I mean, people really like the idea around it, but again, they're like, okay, but it needs to be, you know, we fund it. We fund programs, not events. Which is also one of the reasons why we built in the whole Fellowship.\n\n00:41:39 SPK_1\nYeah.\n\n00:41:40 SPK_2\nComponent to it. And actually the fellowship component, I think would be easy. Would be relatively easy to find funding for. It's the event itself that is. Is a little more problematic.\n\n00:41:54 SPK_1\nYeah. Sort of interesting. Right. Like, it makes sense. Like, people fund programs because there's, like, numbers and metrics and all that, and they can say that they. And then like, an event is an experience. Right. And you could try to get some numbers, like, number of attendees and stuff like that, but it's not quite the same. And the people that want to be in events are people that want to be marketing something, sharing, you know, a logo.\n\n00:42:15 SPK_2\nExactly.\n\n00:42:16 SPK_1\nSo yeah, yeah.\n\n00:42:18 SPK_2\nSo that's the challenge that I'm facing right now. But I mean, I haven't given up. I'm still exploring. But I'm trying to also think outside of the box, outside of the people that we've, that we've already engaged in, our current partners and so on and trying to connect with other collaborators that we've had across the region and kind of, you know, hearing from them if they have any suggestions and so on and so forth. In terms of USBADI specifically, he loved the. I mean he was, he was really great. Like, he was really receptive. And I think if it was that we were optimizing. You just asked us questions about our work in general. In general, he. In terms of, in terms of them funding, it does seem like it might be difficult, but because he said basically their funding for 2025 has already been out. They do have like discretionary funding that is like about the descript, like extra, you know, money from the director or I don't know, whoever else that they can allocate to specific things that arise. But it's normally not a lot of money. You're saying probably like max 20k. 20k. It would have to be given to a Levant based organization. So, you know, for example, you guys are still registered in, in Lebanon, right?\n\n00:43:50 SPK_1\nYeah.\n\n00:43:54 SPK_2\nBut again, he was saying, you know, it would make. Because I suggested, because he was like, you know, that's one of the issues. And then I suggested, you know what, maybe if we, if we partner with Bloom, you could just fund them and then, you know, they can do part of the work we can collaborate on together. Together and it might be related. And when I connected it back with it, I know you had mentioned this to the fellowship that you guys already have. He seemed really kind of excited about that. He was like, oh, wait, yeah, you know, actually that would make a lot of sense. It would be easier for us to just kind of expand our scope of work with Bloom rather than create kind of a whole separate thing. And he thought that that would be doable. So he told us in terms of next step that he was gonna go and speak to his, to his director, the team or whatever. I shared the concept note that I had and then that he was going to get back to me and I told him that I would bring you in to the next conversation to think about what that might actually look like.\n\n00:44:57 SPK_1\nYeah, that sounds great. And like we are just beginning to do the outreach for that program. It's. But we, we should, like, I think we just put up the website. It would be really interesting to move forward on it a little bit quicker, just so that.\n\n00:45:17 SPK_2\nQuicker. Yeah. Right.\n\n00:45:18 SPK_1\nEven as people are onboarding, they know what to expect. Right. Like, there's sort of like the acceleration program, but the idea of this kind of longer engagement and also I think it like sets the tone and the flavor of who will apply and maybe even like the kinds of people we're looking to onboard and accept onto the program. So I think that's an important element because right now I think it's a pretty open ended, you know, social impact acceleration project. Yeah.\n\n00:45:50 SPK_2\nCan you, can you actually share a little more about it? Like, because I know you shivered a little in our first meeting, but can you remind me, like, how many people are we talking about? Is it just 13 people in Lebanon or is it regional?\n\n00:46:03 SPK_1\n13 people? It's regional. It's between. Let me see if I can find the Bloom PM programs. I think we've updated that. Yeah, it's 13 people in the accelerator, 30 in the sprints, and 100 in the. In the boot camp. Like, not the boot camp. What do we call it? The. On the open house.\n\n00:46:31 SPK_2\nOh, okay. And so these are 13 people. Why are there 30 in the sprints? Because in the sprints you bring in people that they can collaborate with.\n\n00:46:39 SPK_1\nNo, it's a funnel. It's like we get 100 into the open house. We gauge their interest, we select from them 30 that go through the sprints, and we try to like, see who's participating, who's able to, you know, use technology in a way that we require for our virtual programs. And then we go from there. Who's contributing to each other, who's able to. Yeah, Anyway, so. And then we go into the acceleration. So that's, that's how we identify our, our participants.\n\n00:47:08 SPK_2\nOkay. And so you end with 13 by when? Like from when you start the program. When do you end with?\n\n00:47:15 SPK_1\nSo the open house runs for a month. The sprint is two weeks. So like we, the open house, you can think of it like a marketing period. We have speakers that come. It could be you. You could be talking about anything. And then kind of talking also about the fellowship. It could be others. Usually we look for people that relate to the themes of the program. People that would have a draw, especially because it is a way that we want people to come and learn about what's happening. And so we look for people that can do that. And like Relevant topics that are supportive for social enterprises. And then from there we say and apply. So that's the open house. Last a month. And then we take from that. We do our selection, our first pass, and we pick, I think 30, 30 or more. It's like. It's something like that, but like it's the shoulders part of the funnel before the final selection happens at the end of the sprint. So that whole process is about. I forget. I think we start for at least two, three weeks before the open house, just inviting people to events. And then the open house, of course, there's continual marketing and then, you know, things really get going with the sprint and we stop the marketing and we focus on the. The training and facilitation. So that's the process. I'm still looking for. Like, I thought the website was up, but I think I need to look at slack. But yeah, I can. I can share the slack with you. Axi 3. Oh, I think that's. Yeah. Okay, here we go. Found the fourth edition. Okay, so it's just bloom PM xe4. So that's. That's how we're describing. The project application is open on February 3rd. Join the open house, partner with us. It's a very specific amount of money because it was in British pounds converted. $3,830, I think it was. I forget exactly. Some. Some nice round British number.\n\n00:49:20 SPK_2\nOkay. And then so the open house, is it all. Okay.\n\n00:49:25 SPK_1\nYeah. So Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Syrian diaspora. That's the target.\n\n00:49:34 SPK_2\nGot it. Is it all. Sorry, the open house events, are they. Is it all online or hybrid or like, what do you do? Like, where do they have it? Or online.\n\n00:49:46 SPK_1\nIt's all. It's all online. It's really hard to work with people from all these countries and do things in person. Maybe at the end. This is why I thought of the fellowship. Like. Like everything is virtual, but at least you have the light at the end of the tunnel. The excitement of, like meeting in person. It's actually really sweet when you run a program. We've done this before with a pretty previous program where people, you know, were all over the world. Actually this was like, you know, Africa and Mina and they all got together, Dubai at the end of the program. And it was really beautiful. They had built a lot of connections and relationships that, yeah. Were able to.\n\n00:50:20 SPK_2\nI'm just thinking, like, if we were able. Yeah. Like in terms of a potential. If we were able in our fellowship with your fellowship, what that might look like. I'm just thinking about how we might be Able to incorporate GCC folks, like, you know, at what stage in the process? Folks, you know, at what stage in the process?\n\n00:50:42 SPK_1\nWe can ask Abed if we can expand the selection to GCC as well. If there's. If he's excited about the idea of this fellowship. Because the. Yeah, and, and we can actually just bring them together. But would. Is the. No, no, it's Middle east limited. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Or would it be fine to have some Palestinian everybody?\n\n00:51:09 SPK_2\nThe idea would be for it to be like everybody.\n\n00:51:12 SPK_1\nOkay. Yeah, well, I don't know. Like, I think that would be the question. Like. Yeah, I think, you know, this, this region, the Levant in particular, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon is important for the, the. I think they're Syrians or something like the funders themselves. And so this might be why they are prioritizing this. And so we can ask. Although. Yeah, although two things. One is that amount of money might not mean much to people in the gcc and I'm not sure why.\n\n00:51:45 SPK_2\nBut also I think like the foundation would be interested. I don't know. Also I think Julie, what your thoughts are. Like it is a bit of a different. I mean it's a very different format. Right. In terms of what we're trying to do. It's more. Very different format. Right. Well, first of all, it's not necessarily connected to social entrepreneurship. Social. Like it could be change makers across any field. Like it could be. The idea is the, it's more of a. The learning and then the practicing. The idea is that it's more of a collecting data, practicing because we do like numbers after all. Testing different approaches.\n\n00:52:29 SPK_1\nThe right things is okay. Yeah, good.\n\n00:52:31 SPK_2\nSorry, I think there's a little bit of like I was saying, like a lag. Testing different approaches again, community building approaches, approaches that help create shared meaning etc. So having these people go and test these approaches etc and see what works, what doesn't work. Like what are some processes and see what works, what doesn't work. Some work. Like what are some processes.\n\n00:52:55 SPK_1\nYeah, I mean the themes here, if you look at them are very aligned with that. So like active citizenship, good governance, independent media I think is also one of the things that can possibly help with those bridges. System change, connecting different stakeholders, governments, nonprofits, businesses. So like it definitely thematically, I think.\n\n00:53:16 SPK_3\nYeah, that's what I was going to say. I was checking the models before you send the image on your website and I do think that there's ways to, to tie specifically with like systems change maybe to tie specifically with all the other ones. Active Citizenship. We would just have to. So, yeah, I think that the design of our. Our fellowship wasn't really like. It's. It's not because we specifically wanted our fellowship to do a fellowship the way we built it. It was more because we were hoping that Kaz would be the founder. But. But I do think that there's ways to tie the two things together because there is always related themes.\n\n00:53:59 SPK_2\nAnd basically the idea was also for, again, as we were mentioning, for the. I guess the. The format doesn't necessarily matter per se. It's more about getting these folks to also drive what is happening at the summit. Right. To also drive what is happening in that sense. Right.\n\n00:54:20 SPK_3\nYeah.\n\n00:54:21 SPK_1\nIs it possible to have some, like, for the. The ability to. To have this reach? Like, we know maybe we work with abids and we partially fund the fellowships that are going to be coming from that region. And then, you know, of course, you, like, find funds for others and you fund them from whomever is willing to fund this because they're very different things. Like, the fellowship that you're talking about doesn't have to be all 13 or all 30 or whatever. Right. Like, we can use this process of finding people that have these parallels, and maybe only five out of the 13 are related to the themes that matter for you. And it would be another application process. But we could say that, you know, we have seats for five and we're excited and to have it be funded by the ossuary foundation, pay their tickets or hotel. The fellowship costs for that. That part. And then the rest of. I don't know how many people you're thinking for the fellowship, like, from the broader GCC region.\n\n00:55:21 SPK_2\nYeah.\n\n00:55:21 SPK_1\nCan be done.\n\n00:55:22 SPK_2\nThat's a good idea.\n\n00:55:24 SPK_1\nFunding and sourcing mechanism.\n\n00:55:26 SPK_2\nThat's a good idea.\n\n00:55:27 SPK_3\nThat's a good idea.\n\n00:55:29 SPK_2\nOkay. Okay. In terms of next steps. In terms of next steps. So, as you see, everything is a little bit up in the air. See, everything is a little bit, I.\n\n00:55:45 SPK_1\nGuess, right now, because if we can somehow expand the program, it would make things a little easy because there is a tiny bit of trickiness here. If, you know, Osfari says 20K for adding the fellowship to the AXI program, and we do the application process on our criteria, and then we invite people to apply for the fellowship. And, you know, 20k would have been good for five people, but we only found four or something like that. Like, we would. There would be, like, an issue, like, what do we do with the funding? Right. What if none of them match? What if, for whatever reason, they all Apply and you're like, not quite really. You know, so this. This process of, like, getting the selection criteria and making sure that when people are applying, they. They know that maybe this is what it is. Like, every. We tell everyone when you apply, you have the opportunity to be selected for this other thing, and we involve you in the selection process to make sure that we have people that can be good candidates. And then you would pick from our 13. The. The. The five that you think are the most appropriate. That way we don't have this, like, numbers issue. So. So we just tell people, like, you know, we have 13 spots for the acceleration and we're gonna number for the fellowship, but that would require it to be more seamlessly integrated with the rest. Right. Like, telling people we want people that are working on these things, and that would require, I think, a little bit of shifting on our part and on, like, the way that we message and the. Yeah, the alignments around that. But I, I think it's like, it's close enough. And I'm not sure what. What, like, areas might not fit. Like sustainability maybe in particular.\n\n00:57:36 SPK_2\nI mean. I mean, sustainability actually as well, because we're talking about, you know, ecological belonging and that stuff.\n\n00:57:42 SPK_1\nOkay, well, maybe. Maybe it is aligned enough that we don't need to do much, which would be great for. For us and for me, because. Because then we don't have to, like, go back, get the team to be like, okay, let's. Let's find. If we can see enough of an alignment, then we can just do this process of say, okay, there's 13 seats for the accelerator. Here's the funnel. And there's also an additional bonus, like five seats for people to actually meet in person, blah, blah, blah. They'll be meeting with people from this fellowship that are also coming from the gcc. And then. But that would be another process. Right? Like, we. I guess you could say we're helping source and we'll, like, bring you in line with the selection and hopefully, you know, we would be able to kind of unlock the funds for that through the Osfari foundation and then the rest of the funds and then how to get the GCC selection and funds would be another question. But, yeah, that's how we can think. Yeah, that could be a way.\n\n00:58:34 SPK_2\nYeah. And just FYI, we do have a backup in terms of the actual event. So we have an organization, they're called Art Studio, that we've worked with, that we've collaborated with a lot in the past, that have a conference already, like, basically an ongoing Conference that is being supported by the National Council for Arts and Letter in Kuwait. And they basically offered to have us take over their conference next year. So basically we would have the venue and the catering, like basic cost cover. We would still need to basically figure out travel and so on. But that's our backup plan in case we don't, you know, get the funding to be able to do it the way that we had originally envisioned, which is not bad. So. So.\n\n00:59:24 SPK_1\nWhat if we did a pilgrimage where people came on foot for months in advance, camping and connecting with communities on the go, picking up stories, sharing theirs, building the bridges all along the way. Right. Don't get money for travel. Yeah.\n\n00:59:40 SPK_3\nAt least the fellows, I think Japan was. Was had that format. What One of the limits that the one that they did in Japan was actually a pilgrimage.\n\n00:59:52 SPK_1\nNo, they brought everyone walking. That's so cool.\n\n00:59:55 SPK_2\nYeah, yeah. But yeah. So in terms of next steps, I got an auto response the last time I spoke, quote, I wrote Abdul Rahman that said he was out of office, I think until like now. Ish. So I guess because I'm waiting to hear back. So the next step is basically waiting for him to reach out again after he's done his. Had his conversation with his team. If I don't hear back from him shortly, I will follow up, but I'll try to. Yeah. Activate this process as soon as possible. And in the meantime, like, I don't know if. So I guess you can just wait for that and then take it from there.\n\n01:00:37 SPK_1\nThere was another.\n\n01:00:38 SPK_2\nBut in general, I just wanted to.\n\n01:00:40 SPK_1\nYeah, I was looking into, but I did not find. I didn't want to spend too much time searching while on the call. But I was a part of this thing. I think I told you about it like the. On being projects, Krista Tippett, all that jazz. But. Oh yeah, yeah. But it didn't. I thought they would put their funders on the page, but they did not. But their funders were really interesting and I don't know how to find their funders. There's got to be a place. But yeah, so what I thought we could do is like look into their funders because they are funding very conversational, very different kind of things. And there's like. Have you heard of the Fetzer Institute funding? Okay, yeah. So what I, what I would like to do is figure out who these funders are. And I remember when I was at the conference, I met with some of the funders and that was actually one of the interesting things that they did is the funders were part of the participants and they were engaging and connecting and sharing. And it wasn't like we're funding and you're receiving. It was, they were like. We didn't really, I didn't really know who the funders were in the audience and I thought that maybe funders don't fund events unless maybe they're a part of it. That kind of changes the dynamic a little bit and it could be an interesting way of pitching things. But there was like this really interesting Baha'I organization that was funding this On Being summit on, On Being gathering and there was like the Fetzer Institute and there's like some of these other grant giving organizations that were there. And I thought it could be interesting just to see who funded On Being and if we can reach out to them. And then also just sharing the idea of. Rather than telling them that you're inviting them to fund an event, telling them, I don't know how to frame it in a way, but basically telling them that we want to invite you to be a part of the event and contribute your ideas, your thoughts and funding to help make it happen. You know, something like that, like this other reframe. Because this conversation is really important and we believe that, you know, you're, you bring more than just your money essentially that we need you to be a part of the conversation and I think you can also help make it happen. Something like that. Like, I'm not sure, you'd probably have your language.\n\n01:03:16 SPK_2\nYeah, no, absolutely. And I think that matches really well with what you were talking about last time, this idea of creating a space world. So, you know, people who are involved in the social change sector in the Middle east that are feeling a lot of discomfort, right, with donors, and especially international donors and feelings a lot of, a lot of, you know, cognitive dissonance and what theness about their policies and so on. It's kind of creating a space for these conversations with donors to happen.\n\n01:03:47 SPK_1\nYeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's really related and you know, it could be interesting just like the way of breaking into the conversation because a lot of donors are people too, right? And they may be feeling a little bit of this unease or detention or like what should we be doing now given what has happened? And you can call this event like an emergence that can sense into the field by bringing things into proximity and curating context for good conversation. And yeah, I think it could be like a way of inviting like, and actually making them first class citizens or however you want to frame It. But like, you're not. You're not funders. Like, you're actually a part of the problem and the solution. Just like we're a part of the problem and the solution, and we need to bring as many people together to talk about this. And even if you can't fund, can you be present? You know, I think that way, like, they. They can say no and yes at the same time. And if you can't fund and you can be present, who do you think might want to fund or can fund? And it changes, like, the way they think about it. And instead of being like a yes and no kind of oppositional, it's like, oh, you're right. You know, I do sense these problems. I would love to be a part of a conversation like that. And I can't fund it because of XYZ constraints. These people might. And then. Or who do you think? What other funders do you think should be a part of that conversation? Because I don't know everybody. It's, you know, this is your domain. You probably know some other people. Is there someone that you'd like to reach out to? Can you make an intro? Something like that. And then at least you also have like a thread, you know, to crawl down.\n\n01:05:42 SPK_2\nYeah, yeah, that is super helpful. Thank you so much.\n\n01:05:47 SPK_1\nYeah.\n\n01:05:48 SPK_2\nSuper productive call. I love our call.\n\n01:05:51 SPK_1\nYeah, I'm glad because, like, sometimes I feel a little shy because in terms of, like, what makes me come to life is ranting at people or what exactly they call it, but, like, like, it's like the moment of these insights that I just want to share. And I love it. But I also, like, need to know that it was appreciated or, like, need to put it into the right context and be able to contain it. Like something like that. So I'm glad that I'm not completely crazy because going radio silent for a week can make me feel a little bit like, am I like, on the edge of madness or does this make sense? You know, like something like that?\n\n01:06:30 SPK_2\nNo, it was greatly appreciated. Definitely resonated. And yeah, we'll.\n\n01:06:35 SPK_1\nOh, before I remembered. Yeah, I wanted to. I gave you, like, One of the things that I do that I don't think is very intelligent is I just share documents without any context. So I like this, this paper that I sent you. I think I just want to extend, explain a few things so you don't have to struggle through. Like, okay, who is this Joe guy? What is this paper? What does this imply? What does this mean?\n\n01:06:58 SPK_2\nRight. Yeah.\n\n01:06:59 SPK_1\nHow does this actually connect with what we were talking about. So I'm just going to go over. So Joe isn't working on aligning humans with their values. He wants to align humans with AI, partially because this was funded by open AI, partially because as these things get more and more powerful, there's a lot of people really concerned about it. But the process that he's taken, I think is very related to the processes that you're talking about. Like how do we think of values that we can align on. Right. And actually create unity rather than disunity. And this paper describes some research that he did on conservatives and Democrats in America. If by developing what he calls a moral graph, he can get people to see across the aisle and find wisdom. And like, the examples here are a Christian girl struggling with deciding to have an abortion, for instance, or like, should the January 6th protesters be pardoned, for instance. Right. And these, these are very divisive. You know, Democrats versus Republicans would think very differently about both these kinds of things. But can we, by helping people, first of all, articulate what is meaningful about pardoning people or about the abortion decision process in this way that's more comprehensible both to a machine and to other humans? And can we use that process to show what value, what values are what he calls sources of meaning and how people can acknowledge other people's wise decisions? Right. And so the first part basically just goes through and describes like the history of describing different values, like Charles Taylor and Chang and Velluman and like just, you know, you know, paper academic stuff. But it's also very interesting if you're interested in how philosophers have tried to describe what values are in the past. And one of them, what are values? This is, Gabriel, natural and non natural facts about what is good and bad kind of things ought to be promoted. And then Taylor is where this idea of instrumental comes from. Values are criteria used in a choice which are not merely instrumental. So things that you would do in and of themselves. And Joe takes that and expands it into what he calls sources of meaning, which I don't know if it's described here. Yeah. So this is, this is a values card. So instead of talking about, actually, I think a better way of looking at values card is right here. So these are different kinds of humility, of honesty. Right. Somebody might say, I like honesty, but if, like honesty is a value that I really uphold. Right. But there's different flavors and different kinds of honesty. Honesty doesn't just mean like, well, I don't know what it means for you. Which one of these three Are you more closely aligned with like epistemic humility? And then this, these two over here actually for, for his system don't matter. This is just like human legible to try to get like a gist of things. But this is the kind of specific, he calls them constitutive attentional policies. So the idea of, well, a human being has attention, ability to perceive and like an action and then like systems that maintain that homeostasis to be able to perceive and enact. And so really understanding what attention is in a moment of meaning and what is actually being attuned to can help. You know, what about a moment of meaning matters? Right. So this is, this is his like theory of like how we know what matters is like, what do we attend to in a moment where like, wow, this is really meaningful. So he says for epistemic humility, the example might be doubts about the claim. So you're kind of like doubting your, your own self. Right. Embodied authenticity is another kind of honesty. Maybe somebody's talking about a sense of settledness that arises when my words and actions align with my truth. So that's like an embodied kind of thing that they're, they're noticing they're attending to. And so this is what he calls values cards. And it's not necessarily what people see on the back end, but what he does is he tries to create graphs where different people are grappling with decisions and expressing values in this very coherence. And what he calls auditable. Like, where's the word auditable? Somewhere. Yeah. Anyhow, so just like running over the paper, you actually see these different, like people run through a whole decision making process and then they're asked to look at these two different ways of being or sources of meaning or values cards or whatever. And people are asked whether or not the person became wiser. Right. So in the context of a child, do you want the child to just listen to you and have like role models that embody discipline or would you rather create opportunities to guide a user towards their passion? And so rather than forcing the kid not to look at the computer, is this a wiser way of being with a child, like igniting their passion and people like, yes. Right. And so the whole idea behind that is you take an arbitrary and abstract thing of like civil liberties or social justice or whatever and turn it into the things that people actually like noticing and paying attention to and then showing people what people are attending to when they're becoming wiser. Right. And then you can actually say like, oh, actually like Yes, I agree. And the very, very interesting thing is in terms of, like, ideology. Let me see, like, the end data. Yeah. So people were able to kind of let go of their opinions and actually agree that there is wisdom in other people's responses. Yeah, I forgot. Where was it? Case study. Yeah, here we go. So 70% of the participants agreed that they learned something about the values of others, and 75% gained respect for the other participants. And so, like, I thought that I would explain to you. Like, I don't think I did a great job at explaining the paper, but I wanted to explain to you why I thought the paper would be interesting for you to kind of digest a little bit. Because this is one of the approaches that. That I appreciate and that I'm using as sort of at least the attentional policies part as a way of making more articulate the things that it's hard to be articulate about and making that. Making it more possible to operationalize or do something about. And in terms of aligning people on being like, yeah, like, conservatives are actually right about that. Like, and, you know, maybe the idea of this whole. What does he call it, like a wisdom graph or something like that. Yeah, Meaning graph. And we can actually sort of see the moral arc of history because we can actually talk about the way of being that we actually prefer in each moment. So that's the paper. It could be interesting for you guys.\n\n01:14:41 SPK_2\nYeah. I mean, again, it's very relevant to this idea of, you know, getting people to move away from their positions and create both.\"\n16:49\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nWhat you're getting at is deeply philosophical, systemic, and practical all at once.

      "content": " Here is the essay integrating the new structure, framing, quotes and stories:\n\nFrom Metrics to Meaning: Cultivating an Alive Social Impact\n\n\"How you do anything is how you do everything.\" This simple insight captures a profound truth often overlooked in social impact work: our means shape our ends. The way we approach change - the mindsets, values and practices we embody - fundamentally influences the outcomes we create. \n\nYet too often, the dominant approach is one of instrumental rationality, quantitative metrics, and a rush to scale. We push to demonstrate impact through numbers, to hit targets by the fastest means possible, to \"move fast and break things\" in pursuit of social good. But what if this very approach is undermining the ends we seek? \n\nThe Personal Cost of Inauthenticity\nThis question first arose for me in a visceral way when invited to speak about our work at Bloom on Al Jazeera. On paper, it was an opportunity to showcase our impact to a wide audience. But as I prepared, a deep unease grew within me. The metrics and talking points felt hollow, the story I was telling not quite true. It was as if I was being asked to perform impact rather than embody it.\n\nIn contrast, a moment of profound aliveness arose during our Dubai retreat. Watching our entrepreneurs share from a place of raw honesty, tears flowing, hearts opening, I saw the utter inadequacy of our KPIs to capture what mattered most. Here was real beauty, real transformation unfolding - and it had nothing to do with our carefully constructed impact narrative. \n\nThese experiences revealed to me the price we pay when we contort ourselves to fit external expectations, when we sacrifice depth for speed and meaning for metrics. We lose touch with the very aliveness and integrity that fuel genuine, enduring change.\n\nThe Systemic Costs of Instrumental Rationality\nThis misalignment between means and ends goes beyond the personal - it's embedded in the very DNA of many social impact organizations. Take the microfinance industry. Born from a noble impulse to uplift the poor through entrepreneurship, it rapidly scaled through a commercially-driven, purely quantitative approach. Institutions obsessed over repayment rates and financial returns while losing sight of the wellbeing of the very people they aimed to serve. The result? A system that too often enriched investors while trapping borrowers in cycles of debt. The \"how\" tragically undermined the \"why\".  \n\nOr consider the social enterprise that chases growth at all costs, prizing vanity metrics over real value creation. Fueled by hype and FOMO, it scales quickly - only to collapse under the weight of its unresolved contradictions, leaving a trail of broken promises and burnout in its wake.\n\nIn case after case, we see the instrumental mindset backfire - not for lack of good intention, but because of a fatal mismatch between means and ends. As Einstein observed, \"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\" Continuing to apply industrial-age tools of efficiency, control and standardization to the complex, soulful work of social change is a futile endeavor.\n\nShifting from Metrics to Meaning\nWhat's needed is a fundamental re-orientation - from metrics to meaning, from transaction to relationship, from extraction to regeneration. At its core, this is a shift from an industrial mindset of control and reductionism to an ecological one of participation and wholeness. It's a move from forcing outcomes to enabling the conditions for life to naturally thrive.\n\nThis can feel disorienting at first, even impossible. How do we operate without the comforting certainty of quantitative proxies? How do we justify our existence without legible impact stories? But as father Greg Boyle demonstrates, real moral authority and transformative power arise from a deeper place. When asked about his impressive impact with gang members, he simply states, \"I don't hold any outcomes, I just hold people. I say, you are exactly what God had in mind when God made you. Then I sit back and watch the slow miracle unfold.\" \n\nHere we see both the means and the ends rooted in a profound, integral wholeness. Father Greg accesses a way of being so authentic and alive that it naturally invites others into their own aliveness. He's not running programs on people, he's in deep relationship with them - and that makes all the difference. Transformation emerges not through targeted interventions, but through the presence of unshakable love.\n\nGardening Aliveness \nFather Greg embodies a way of change that's less like engineering and more like gardening. An engineer seeks to impose an external design through force; a gardener creates the conditions for life to flourish in its own unique way. This calls for deep attunement - sensing what wants to grow, removing obstacles, providing nourishment. Not domination, but co-creation.\n\nIn nature, this leads to a resilient, regenerative diversity. A healthy garden requires far less external control to thrive than a monocrop plantation. Vitality arises from each element expressing its unique essence within a web of supportive relationships. Could we approach society this way - not as a machine to be optimized, but as a garden to be tended?\n\nThis points to a profound shift from controlling change to participating in an unfolding. From assembling parts to enabling wholes. It's a shift from interfering with the wisdom of life's natural rhythms to listening for the deep logic of emergence. From asking \"what can I force to happen?\" to \"what wants to happen, and how can I create the conditions for it to arise?\" \n\nIn practice, this means slowing down to sense the seeds of potential waiting to sprout. It means attuning to the unique essence of people and places, and nurturing that to fruition. It means embracing uncertainty and organic timing rather than pre-determined outcomes and arbitrary deadlines. Most of all, it means trusting the innate drive within each person and community to grow towards wholeness when given a conducive environment.\n\nCultivating Inner Conditions\nThis outer shift, of course, requires inner work. We can't sustain an integral, ecological approach to change if we're still operating from fractured, mechanistic selves. As Gandhi urged, we must become the change we wish to see - not as a platitude, but as an embodied reality.  \n\nThis is where personal practices of connecting to our deeper sources of meaning become vital. We need to develop the capacity to sense the subtle aliveness moving within us, to discern the quiet voice of authentic calling beneath the clamor of ego and habit. This is a capacity that's been denigrated and suppressed in our overly-rational culture, yet it remains our truest guide.\n\nOne powerful gateway to accessing this inner knowing is through the gateway of emotions. As Bilal explains, emotions aren't just random feelings - they're illuminating the places where our current reality isn't aligned with our deepest values. Grief shows us what we love. Anger highlights where a boundary has been transgressed. Fear points to what we must protect. Each emotion, when met with gentle curiosity, reveals a hidden facet of what truly matters to us.  \n\nBy learning to befriend and listen to our emotions, we develop a felt sense of our unique sources of meaning. We get clearer on our \"want-to's\" - the things we're intrinsically motivated to do - in contrast with the \"have-to's\" imposed from without. As we align our actions with this inner knowing, we experience a growing coherence and aliveness. We access a deeper well of energy and insight for our work in the world.\n\nExperiments in Coming Alive\nThis inner/outer marriage of integrity and impact is a lifelong journey, not an overnight transformation. It proceeds not through grand pronouncements, but through humble experiments in truth. We begin where we are, with small daily choices to honor our authentic knowing. Postponing a deadline to pause and check in. Speaking a hard truth with care. Choosing courage over comfort when called to take a stand. Listening to the heart's guidance, even when the mind judges it as irrational.\n\nAs we take these steps, we discover that our inner knowing can be trusted - that it leads us towards greater aliveness, connection and efficacy. Tiny act by tiny act, we begin experiencing ourselves as part of life's interconnected dance rather than as separate controllers. This naturally shifts how we show up in our teams, organizations and systems. We listen more than we preach. We sense our way forward rather than imposing master plans. We embrace emergence rather than demanding certainty.\n\nGradually, in ways both subtle and seismic, we find our social impact work transforming from the inside out. Beneath the surface of spreadsheets and log frames, we're tending the soil of authentic relationship, shared purpose, and trust in life's regenerative impulse. Within the shell of existing structures, we're sowing seeds for the next paradigm to emerge.\n\nFrom Transactions to Relationships \nAs this embodied knowing permeates our organizations, we naturally begin operating from a partnership mindset. People cease being objects to change and become subjects of profound encounter. Our focus shifts from one-way service delivery to mutual transformation through relationship.\n\nPractically, this means restructuring funding to be based on partnership rather than paternalism. It means prioritizing authentic connection over transactional networking. It means designing programs through deep listening rather than top-down planning. Acknowledging that our destinies are intertwined, we approach change through the lens of \"power with\" rather than \"power over\".\n\nWhat arises is a richer, multi-directional flow of gifts - not just money, but wisdom, care, inspiration, and solidarity. Each person's unique contribution is honored, while all are held within the larger story of our shared becoming. No longer just givers and receivers, we're co-participants in nurturing the health of the whole. \n\nThe Wisdom of Enough\nA defining trait of this ecological mindset is knowing when enough is enough. Whereas the industrial model pursues endless growth, nature teaches balance and right proportion. As social impact practitioners, this means attuning to the real needs of a situation - not the insatiable hunger of organizational bloat or funders' arbitrary targets.\n\nThis is where inner and outer alignment becomes paramount. The more sourced we are in sufficiency, the less susceptible we are to chasing excess institutionally. We learn to measure success not by scale alone, but by depth, integrity, and catalytic impact. We become less attached to sustaining our particular organizations than to serving life's larger unfolding.  \n\nIn concrete terms, this means daring to refuse funding that would pull us out of integrity. It means getting radically honest about whether our programs are truly serving or simply self-perpetuating. It means defining success as growing people and partnerships to the point where they no longer need us. Powered by a deeper faith in the resilience of communities and the wisdom of life, we operate with open-handed humility rather than grasping control.\n\nTending Transformation\nThe path from metrics to meaning is ultimately one of ego-surrender. Of bowing into the unfathomable mystery at the heart of change, which will forever elude capture in our clumsy calculus of cause and effect. It's learning to trust that our worthiness isn't measured by outcomes achieved, but by the sincerity of our showing up. That true impact ripples out in ways we'll often never know.\n\nAs we step into this greater unknowing, we begin experiencing our work as a form of spiritual practice. Less forcing fruits than tending the soil of possibility. Less engineering outcomes than participating in the miracle of emergence. Less changing the world than changing ourselves to be in deeper service to its healing.  \n\nThis isn't to abandon practicality for navel-gazing. Quite the opposite: it's unleashing a higher order practicality aligned with the wisdom of life. One that holds planning and acting lightly, ever responsive to shifting tides. One rooted in presence, that senses opportunities moment-to-moment. One committed to partnering with the innate intelligence of people and place.\n\nWhat arises is a social impact more akin to aikido than architecture. Instead of imposing pre-fixed designs, we sense the energies moving through a situation and redirect them towards greater health. We learn to fall in love with problems not as abstractions to solve, but as invitations into the heart of human and ecological relationships. We become artists of the emergent, midwifing surprising, context-born solutions by weaving connection and creatively holding space.  \n\nSlowly, awkwardly, imperfectly, we're learning to be the land whales of history midwifing the next evolution of human society. One that rejects the false promise of mechanical control for the messy beauty of participatory belonging. One that partners with the wisdom in each person and place to enable widespread flourishing. One rooted in the innate regenerative impulse of life.\n\nThe journey is long and winding, full of unlearning and stumbling. But the vista ahead shimmers with a world where all people, beings and places are cherished as sacred. Where sufficiency and interdependence are guiding principles. Where the good of any part is known to be inseparable from the thriving of the whole. A world where our social impact isn't measured in numbers served, but in the authentic aliveness and care woven between us.\n\nIt's a world being born not through grand plans or technological solutionism, but through humble choices to embody its values in each unfolding moment. As adrienne maree brown wise words reminds us, \"How we're living every single day can be a huge contribution to transformation.\" May we tend this transformation faithfully in the small and large -- trusting that the integrity of our means will guide us true in the end.",

            "text": " Here is the essay integrating the new structure, framing, quotes and stories:\n\nFrom Metrics to Meaning: Cultivating an Alive Social Impact\n\n\"How you do anything is how you do everything.\" This simple insight captures a profound truth often overlooked in social impact work: our means shape our ends. The way we approach change - the mindsets, values and practices we embody - fundamentally influences the outcomes we create. \n\nYet too often, the dominant approach is one of instrumental rationality, quantitative metrics, and a rush to scale. We push to demonstrate impact through numbers, to hit targets by the fastest means possible, to \"move fast and break things\" in pursuit of social good. But what if this very approach is undermining the ends we seek? \n\nThe Personal Cost of Inauthenticity\nThis question first arose for me in a visceral way when invited to speak about our work at Bloom on Al Jazeera. On paper, it was an opportunity to showcase our impact to a wide audience. But as I prepared, a deep unease grew within me. The metrics and talking points felt hollow, the story I was telling not quite true. It was as if I was being asked to perform impact rather than embody it.\n\nIn contrast, a moment of profound aliveness arose during our Dubai retreat. Watching our entrepreneurs share from a place of raw honesty, tears flowing, hearts opening, I saw the utter inadequacy of our KPIs to capture what mattered most. Here was real beauty, real transformation unfolding - and it had nothing to do with our carefully constructed impact narrative. \n\nThese experiences revealed to me the price we pay when we contort ourselves to fit external expectations, when we sacrifice depth for speed and meaning for metrics. We lose touch with the very aliveness and integrity that fuel genuine, enduring change.\n\nThe Systemic Costs of Instrumental Rationality\nThis misalignment between means and ends goes beyond the personal - it's embedded in the very DNA of many social impact organizations. Take the microfinance industry. Born from a noble impulse to uplift the poor through entrepreneurship, it rapidly scaled through a commercially-driven, purely quantitative approach. Institutions obsessed over repayment rates and financial returns while losing sight of the wellbeing of the very people they aimed to serve. The result? A system that too often enriched investors while trapping borrowers in cycles of debt. The \"how\" tragically undermined the \"why\".  \n\nOr consider the social enterprise that chases growth at all costs, prizing vanity metrics over real value creation. Fueled by hype and FOMO, it scales quickly - only to collapse under the weight of its unresolved contradictions, leaving a trail of broken promises and burnout in its wake.\n\nIn case after case, we see the instrumental mindset backfire - not for lack of good intention, but because of a fatal mismatch between means and ends. As Einstein observed, \"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\" Continuing to apply industrial-age tools of efficiency, control and standardization to the complex, soulful work of social change is a futile endeavor.\n\nShifting from Metrics to Meaning\nWhat's needed is a fundamental re-orientation - from metrics to meaning, from transaction to relationship, from extraction to regeneration. At its core, this is a shift from an industrial mindset of control and reductionism to an ecological one of participation and wholeness. It's a move from forcing outcomes to enabling the conditions for life to naturally thrive.\n\nThis can feel disorienting at first, even impossible. How do we operate without the comforting certainty of quantitative proxies? How do we justify our existence without legible impact stories? But as father Greg Boyle demonstrates, real moral authority and transformative power arise from a deeper place. When asked about his impressive impact with gang members, he simply states, \"I don't hold any outcomes, I just hold people. I say, you are exactly what God had in mind when God made you. Then I sit back and watch the slow miracle unfold.\" \n\nHere we see both the means and the ends rooted in a profound, integral wholeness. Father Greg accesses a way of being so authentic and alive that it naturally invites others into their own aliveness. He's not running programs on people, he's in deep relationship with them - and that makes all the difference. Transformation emerges not through targeted interventions, but through the presence of unshakable love.\n\nGardening Aliveness \nFather Greg embodies a way of change that's less like engineering and more like gardening. An engineer seeks to impose an external design through force; a gardener creates the conditions for life to flourish in its own unique way. This calls for deep attunement - sensing what wants to grow, removing obstacles, providing nourishment. Not domination, but co-creation.\n\nIn nature, this leads to a resilient, regenerative diversity. A healthy garden requires far less external control to thrive than a monocrop plantation. Vitality arises from each element expressing its unique essence within a web of supportive relationships. Could we approach society this way - not as a machine to be optimized, but as a garden to be tended?\n\nThis points to a profound shift from controlling change to participating in an unfolding. From assembling parts to enabling wholes. It's a shift from interfering with the wisdom of life's natural rhythms to listening for the deep logic of emergence. From asking \"what can I force to happen?\" to \"what wants to happen, and how can I create the conditions for it to arise?\" \n\nIn practice, this means slowing down to sense the seeds of potential waiting to sprout. It means attuning to the unique essence of people and places, and nurturing that to fruition. It means embracing uncertainty and organic timing rather than pre-determined outcomes and arbitrary deadlines. Most of all, it means trusting the innate drive within each person and community to grow towards wholeness when given a conducive environment.\n\nCultivating Inner Conditions\nThis outer shift, of course, requires inner work. We can't sustain an integral, ecological approach to change if we're still operating from fractured, mechanistic selves. As Gandhi urged, we must become the change we wish to see - not as a platitude, but as an embodied reality.  \n\nThis is where personal practices of connecting to our deeper sources of meaning become vital. We need to develop the capacity to sense the subtle aliveness moving within us, to discern the quiet voice of authentic calling beneath the clamor of ego and habit. This is a capacity that's been denigrated and suppressed in our overly-rational culture, yet it remains our truest guide.\n\nOne powerful gateway to accessing this inner knowing is through the gateway of emotions. As Bilal explains, emotions aren't just random feelings - they're illuminating the places where our current reality isn't aligned with our deepest values. Grief shows us what we love. Anger highlights where a boundary has been transgressed. Fear points to what we must protect. Each emotion, when met with gentle curiosity, reveals a hidden facet of what truly matters to us.  \n\nBy learning to befriend and listen to our emotions, we develop a felt sense of our unique sources of meaning. We get clearer on our \"want-to's\" - the things we're intrinsically motivated to do - in contrast with the \"have-to's\" imposed from without. As we align our actions with this inner knowing, we experience a growing coherence and aliveness. We access a deeper well of energy and insight for our work in the world.\n\nExperiments in Coming Alive\nThis inner/outer marriage of integrity and impact is a lifelong journey, not an overnight transformation.

            "extracted_content": "From Metrics to Meaning: Why Our Worldview Matters More Than Our Numbers\n“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”\n—Albert Einstein\n\nI. Introduction: The Crisis of “Doing Good”\nIn the modern “changemaker” scene—social enterprises, NGOs, philanthropic initiatives—there’s a mounting unease. On the surface, impact metrics, corporate-style scaling strategies, and ROI dashboards promise efficiency and accountability. Yet many of us are left feeling that something is off. As one social entrepreneur observed, “We can meet all the SDGs and still hate our lives.”\n\nWhy is this? The tension arises because, in trying to “do good,” we often adopt the same extractive, competitive, and disconnected logic that fueled the problems we’re trying to solve. We measure success by numbers alone, chase quick wins, and treat humans as data points. Meanwhile, the deeper sources of meaning—our capacity for relationship, beauty, truth, and what truly makes us come alive—are dismissed as intangible or “woo-woo.”\n\nYet across cultures, we find reminders that how we do things inevitably shapes what we create. As the Caribbean saying goes, “If you cut corners, you’ll build a round house.” Or in Chinese wisdom, “The water takes the shape of the vessel it fills.” If the “vessel” is a mindset of acceleration, extraction, and superficial metrics, our “impact” outcomes will reflect those qualities—no matter how noble our intentions.\n\nThis essay explores why the worldview behind our actions matters more than any well-intentioned façade of doing good. We will look at:\n\nReal-World Cases: Social enterprises and NGOs adopting corporate practices with harmful consequences.\nMetaphors from Multiple Cultures: Why superficial fixes fail when the deeper logic remains unchanged.\nCraft, Gardens, and Slow Approaches: Alternative models (like Shinola or Arlan’s Boat Works) that focus on quality, relationship, and presence.\nPractical Shifts: How to realign from “metrics mania” to meaningful, human-centered ways of working.\nII. Doing Good Gone Wrong: How a Corporate Mindset Distorts Social Mission\n“You cannot wash blood with blood.”\n—(Indian Proverb)\nMeaning: Using the same destructive mindset that caused the problem will not heal it.\n\nNumerous organizations begin with genuine aims—providing relief, protecting the planet, empowering the vulnerable—yet adopt the same mechanistic worldview prevalent in corporate arenas. The results often backfire.\n\n1. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)\nWhat Happened: Microfinance originally aimed to uplift marginalized communities through small loans, especially to women entrepreneurs. But as MFIs expanded, they embraced profit-maximizing goals, aggressive repayment targets, and loan quotas. This devolved into coercive practices, high interest rates, and even borrower suicides (e.g., in parts of India).\nKey Lesson: A purely corporate growth mindset, obsessed with repayment metrics, compromised the deeper purpose of alleviating poverty. “You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear,” goes an English proverb—high-quality social uplift can’t emerge from low-quality methods rooted in extraction.\n2. Charity: “Efficiency” in Disaster Relief\nWhat Happened: After Haiti’s 2010 earthquake, large NGOs chased donor satisfaction and visible “completion metrics” (houses built, roads paved). In reality, poorly planned infrastructure neither lasted nor respected local wisdom. Billions of dollars were spent inefficiently, guided by ROI mania rather than resilient community-building.\nKey Lesson: “If you cut corners, you’ll build a round house.” Rushing to please donors erodes the long-term relationships and robust planning needed to foster genuine recovery.\n3. Fair Trade’s “Certification Industrial Complex”\nWhat Happened: Fair Trade began to secure just prices for small-scale farmers. Over time, formal certification processes ballooned, catering to big plantations with minimal real oversight. Small farmers found themselves edged out or unable to afford certification fees, thus reinforcing inequality.\nKey Lesson: “If the root is rotten, the fruit cannot be sweet.” (Chinese proverb). Even if a brand’s packaging displays “Fair Trade,” the underlying system can remain exploitative if scaled using purely corporate logic.\n4. Nonprofit “Professionalization” and Burnout\nWhat Happened: Many nonprofits implement corporate-style hierarchies, productivity metrics, and performance evaluations to appear “serious” to funders. This spawns burnout, high turnover, and mission drift, as staff feel they’re just cogs in a machine—no different from exploitative business cultures. Oxfam and Save the Children faced scandals involving toxic environments and ignoring staff well-being.\nKey Lesson: “A rotten fish spoils the whole pot.” (Indian proverb). Importing hierarchical, efficiency-obsessed practices kills morale and authenticity in missions founded on care and empathy.\n5. Education Startups and “Datafication”\nWhat Happened: EdTech ventures often prioritize standardized test scores, data analytics, and “scalable” models. Programs meant to empower students end up reinforcing rigid metrics and control, overlooking local contexts or teacher expertise. Bridge International Academies was criticized for scripted lessons that disempowered teachers.\nKey Lesson: “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” (English saying). Even well-meant data-driven solutions can flatten the rich complexities of learning, turning students into numbers rather than nurturing their holistic growth.\nExtended Examples: More “Doing Good Gone Wrong”\nFast Fashion’s “Conscious Collections”: A tiny fraction of production labeled “sustainable” while the core model remains exploitative, driving overconsumption.\nVolunteer Tourism (“Voluntourism”): Feel-good experiences for visitors overshadow truly sustainable community involvement.\nCarbon Offsetting Programs: Planting trees to “offset” continuing emissions ends up greenwashing root problems of overproduction.\nPrivatization of Public Services: When essential services like water or healthcare become for-profit ventures, inequality often deepens rather than resolving.\nAcross these cases, the underlying flaw is a neoliberal logic of extraction, speed, and seeing people as instruments—“Wearing a new mask on the same face,” so to speak. Or in other metaphors:\n\n“Pouring Clean Water into a Dirty Cup”: Good intentions poured into a toxic system remain compromised.\n“Trying to Grow Organic Food in Polluted Soil”: A philanthropic or social enterprise effort inherits the toxins of competition and profit-maximization if it doesn’t question them.\n“Teaching Wolves to Herd Sheep”: Corporate growth mindsets conflict at a core level with relational or community-based interventions.\nIII. Why the Same Mindset Replicates the Same Problems\n“The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.”\n—Audre Lorde\n\nThis quote captures the heart of the issue: adopting the conventional corporate toolbox for social impact typically reproduces competition, hierarchical control, and acceleration. It may deliver short-term outputs, but it rarely fosters deep transformation.\n\nAs an African proverb reminds us:\n\n“The spirit in which you give is more important than the gift itself.”\n\nIf the spirit is one of “check the donor’s box” or “scale at all costs,” the results, no matter how well-packaged, come tainted by that underlying orientation.\n\nInevitable Outcomes of a Corporate Worldview\nDisconnection: People and ecosystems become abstract “beneficiaries” or “resources,” severing authentic relationships.\nExtraction: Metrics revolve around deliverables, ignoring intangible well-being, local knowledge, or cultural context.\nAcceleration: Urgency and quick fixes overshadow the slow, patient building of trust and community-led solutions.\nIn short, “You can’t grow flowers in poisoned soil.” Unless the soil (the worldview) is healed, seeds of social good can’t thrive.\n\nIV. Alternative Path: From Extraction to Quality and Relationship\n“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”\n—Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMoving beyond mechanistic approaches demands a fundamental shift: from forcing growth and manipulating metrics to attending to genuine quality in every action. This calls for slowing down, building relationships, and trusting a deeper faculty of direct perception—one that recognizes beauty, meaning, and authenticity without immediate quantification.\n\nA. The Faculty of Direct Perception\nMany of us have a quiet sense of what “feels right”: an internal compass that distinguishes meaningful engagement from token gestures. Yet we’ve been taught to ignore or belittle this intuition as “unscientific” or “too emotional.”\n\nExample: Shinola in Detroit banked on local pride and skilled craftsmanship to rebuild a watchmaking tradition. The intangible factor—restoring dignity—was no less important than the bottom line.\nExample: Father Greg Boyle’s Homeboy Industries thrives on friendship, not just “data-driven recidivism metrics,” revealing how relationships can supersede conventional accountability tools.\nWhen measurement serves meaning, rather than dictating it, we nurture outcomes far richer than any standard KPI.\n\nB. Models for Slower, Deeper Engagement\nGardening vs. Factories\n\nFactory Mindset: Standardize, control, push throughput.\nGardener Mindset: Prepare the soil, plant seeds, tend patiently, and let nature’s rhythms lead.\nIn social impact, a gardener invests time to understand community needs, fosters local leadership, and remains flexible, allowing emergence instead of forcing compliance.\nCraft, Apprenticeship, and Mastery\n\nArlan’s Boat Works (Maine): Wooden boat building relies on measuring wood precisely and feeling it in your hands—an interplay of logic and intuition. Apprentices learn by closely observing and emulating masters.\nThe “Smooth is Fast” Principle: Slowing down to ensure quality often leads to fewer mistakes, richer relationships, and ironically, more sustainable progress.\nLocal Partnership and Co-Creation\n\nInstead of imposing top-down solutions, co-design interventions with communities.\nExample: Genuine microfinance (before it got corrupted) hinged on relationship-based lending circles, personal trust, and deep local knowledge.\nV. Concrete Shifts: From Superficial Metrics to Meaningful Action\n“How we walk the path shapes where it leads.”\n\nIt’s not enough to critique. We need workable alternatives that respect our need for some data while prioritizing the intangible yet vital aspects of trust, presence, and quality.\n\nRedefine Success Beyond Numbers\n\nIntegrate “well-being indexes,” “meaningful moments,” or “relationship depth” into your organization’s goals.\nExample: “Meaningful Moments per Month per Employee” can replace or complement “hours clocked” or “units produced.”\nShift from Efficiency to Relationship\n\nEfficiency has its place in mundane tasks, but deep social change hinges on relationships.\n“The water takes the shape of the vessel it fills.” (Chinese proverb). If your vessel is purely efficiency-driven, you risk dehumanizing the process of change.\nBuild Time for Reflection and Presence\n\nLike an athlete practicing “smooth is fast,” give space for weekly check-ins or “presence circles.”\nEncourage staff and beneficiaries alike to name tensions, celebrate small wins, and question why certain tasks feel “off.”\nSlow, Context-Specific Scaling\n\nIf you must scale, do it organically. Demand-driven expansions keep the focus on local realities and relationships.\nAvoid “one-size-fits-all” replication. Each new region or community might need a fresh, patient approach.\nHonor the Faculty of Direct Perception\n\nTeach teams to trust qualitative signals— discomfort, resonance, the “aha” of alignment. These are data too, just not numerical.\n“You cannot use fire to put out fire.” (Buddhist teaching). We can’t fix the emotional and relational vacuum by doubling down on spreadsheets.\nVI. Counterexamples & Hope: When Quality Leads to Thriving\nAmid grim stories of microfinance abuses and fair trade distortions, there are shining cases where organizations aligned means and ends more holistically:\n\nShinola (Detroit): Built watchmaking skills locally, paying living wages. The pride of craftsmanship and economic uplift advanced together.\nArlan’s Boat Works: Apprenticeships link tradition, care, and skill. Boats become more than objects; they are tangible evidence of shared mastery.\nFather Greg Boyle’s Homeboy Industries: Prioritizing “they’re my friends” fosters a genuine relational approach—metrics follow, but friendship leads.\nLocal, Indigenous-Led Conservation Efforts: In many parts of the world, indigenous communities manage forests or fisheries sustainably, guided by cultural values that see nature as kin, not a resource.\nWhat unites these examples? A commitment to authenticity, a willingness to slow down, and an embrace of both intangible and tangible dimensions of work. They measure, yes, but with a light touch—serving deeper human or ecological flourishing.\n\nVII. Pulling It All Together: A Worldview Shift\n“The way you make your bed is the way you will sleep.”\n—(African Proverb)\n\nWhen we chase purely corporate metrics or try to “upgrade the chains of a prison” by adding an “ethical veneer” to the same old machinery, we replicate disconnection, extraction, and acceleration. Transformational change demands we question the deeper logic—embracing a worldview of relationship, trust, and quality as fundamental.\n\nA. Embrace the Process as Much as the Outcome\n“One cannot plant weeds and hope for wheat.” (Middle Eastern proverb). If our daily methods are shallow or exploitative, the final product can’t miraculously become ethical.\n“Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” (Mahatma Gandhi). Our internal alignment shapes external impact.\nB. Recognize that Worldviews Are Contagious\nIf you measure everything in “returns,” your partners, employees, and even beneficiaries start seeing themselves as means to an end.\nIf you approach from a place of trust, respect, and presence, you create a culture that values people as people. Over time, that culture yields far-reaching resilience and prosperity.\nC. Allow Time for Emergence\n“Trying to grow organic food in polluted soil” fails because we don’t let the land heal. Similarly, social impact demands letting new models gestate in fresh soil—free from the toxins of constant “scaling” pressure.\nReal change often looks messy or slow at first. But as Shinola and Arlan’s Boat Works show, the craft approach—focusing on depth—creates outcomes that endure.\nVIII. Conclusion: Choosing a Different Path\n“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”\n—Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWe’ve seen how so-called “good intentions” can implode under the weight of a worldview that values speed, competition, and metrics above all else. We’ve glimpsed alternatives—gardener mindsets, craft approaches, local partnership, direct perception—that honor human dignity and ecological balance from the start.\n\nIf the foundation is flawed, no amount of superficial patching will fix it. Or as a Turkish proverb warns, “The pot leaks from where it was poorly sealed.” To truly “seal the pot,” we must reimagine why and how we work, moving from mechanical checklists to living relationships.\n\n“We can meet all the SDGs and still hate our lives.”\nWhen the underlying worldview remains extractive, even well-funded accomplishments can leave us spiritually bankrupt.\n\nBut with a shift to meaning-first, measurement-second, we may find that the intangible—trust, presence, authenticity—becomes our most reliable guide. And paradoxically, when we honor this deeper sense of quality, the quantitative results (financial stability, genuine social impact, ecological restoration) often flourish in ways we could never force with metrics alone.\n\nA Final Invitation\nTry one small experiment:\n\nThe next time you plan a project or hold a team meeting, notice whether the group’s default is “get numbers quickly” or “listen for what’s truly alive in the situation.”\nMake space for a “presence circle,” inviting each person to name one tension and one aspiration. See if a more relational, qualitative understanding emerges.\nThen decide which metrics might support that insight rather than replace it.\nThis shift won’t be instant. We’re all shaped by systems that prize speed and quantification. Yet, as the Chinese proverb reminds us, “As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.” Each choice to bend the twig toward authenticity and depth helps us grow organizations—and societies—that embody the world we wish to see.\n\nKey Takeaways in Brief\nWorldview Is Crucial\n\n“Better maps don’t help if you’re heading in the wrong direction.” A toxic system cannot be fixed by more “efficient” metrics alone.\nDoing Good Goes Wrong When…\n\nWe adopt neoliberal/corporate logic (extraction, disconnection, acceleration) under the banner of “impact.”\nMetaphors to Remember\n\n“Pouring clean water into a dirty cup”\n“Upgrading the chains of a prison”\n“Teaching wolves to herd sheep”\nAlternatives Exist\n\nShinola’s craftsmanship, Arlan’s Boat Works, Homeboy Industries, and countless local/regenerative models show that relational, craft-oriented approaches yield deeper, more lasting impact.\nPractical Shifts\n\nRedefine success: from raw numbers to relationship-based, holistic indicators.\nSlow down for reflection: “smooth is fast.”\nHonor direct perception: intangible signals of alignment matter.\nFinal Quote\n\n“We cannot use fire to put out fire.” (Buddhist Teaching)\nIf the fundamental mindset is broken, we must move beyond it—toward an approach that values quality, trust, and genuine human presence as core principles of our shared future.\nIn closing\nLet us recognize that how we walk the path not only shapes where we end up, but who we become in the process. By reclaiming a slower, relational worldview—one that measures meaning before metrics—we stand a far better chance of nurturing real human flourishing, inside our organizations and across the world."

      "content": " Here is a streamlined combination of the two essays:\n\nFrom Metrics to Meaning: Cultivating an Alive Social Impact \n\n\"How you do anything is how you do everything.\" This simple insight captures a profound truth often overlooked in social impact work: our means shape our ends. The way we approach change - the mindsets, values and practices we embody - fundamentally influences the outcomes we create.  \n\nYet too often, the dominant approach is one of instrumental rationality, quantitative metrics, and a rush to scale. We push to demonstrate impact through numbers, to hit targets by the fastest means possible, to \"move fast and break things\" in pursuit of social good. But what if this very approach is undermining the ends we seek?\n\nThe Crisis of \"Doing Good\"\nIn the modern \"changemaker\" scene—social enterprises, NGOs, philanthropic initiatives—there's a mounting unease. On the surface, impact metrics, corporate-style scaling strategies, and ROI dashboards promise efficiency and accountability. Yet many of us are left feeling that something is off. As one social entrepreneur observed, \"We can meet all the SDGs and still hate our lives.\"\n\nWhy is this? The tension arises because, in trying to \"do good,\" we often adopt the same extractive, competitive, and disconnected logic that fueled the problems we're trying to solve. We measure success by numbers alone, chase quick wins, and treat humans as data points. Meanwhile, the deeper sources of meaning—our capacity for relationship, beauty, truth, and what truly makes us come alive—are dismissed as intangible or \"woo-woo.\"\n\nThe Personal Cost of Inauthenticity \nThis question first arose for me viscerally when invited to speak about our work at Bloom on Al Jazeera. On paper, it was an opportunity to showcase our impact to a wide audience. But as I prepared, a deep unease grew within me. The metrics and talking points felt hollow, the story I was telling not quite true. It was as if I was being asked to perform impact rather than embody it.  \n\nIn contrast, a moment of profound aliveness arose during our Dubai retreat. Watching our entrepreneurs share from a place of raw honesty, tears flowing, hearts opening, I saw the utter inadequacy of our KPIs to capture what mattered most. Here was real beauty, real transformation unfolding - and it had nothing to do with our carefully constructed impact narrative.\n\nThese experiences revealed to me the price we pay when we contort ourselves to fit external expectations, when we sacrifice depth for speed and meaning for metrics. We lose touch with the very aliveness and integrity that fuel genuine, enduring change.\n\nThe Systemic Costs of Instrumental Rationality\nThis misalignment between means and ends goes beyond the personal - it's embedded in the very DNA of many social impact organizations. Numerous organizations begin with genuine aims—providing relief, protecting the planet, empowering the vulnerable—yet adopt the same mechanistic worldview prevalent in corporate arenas. The results often backfire:\n\nMicrofinance institutions chasing repayment rates while fueling debt cycles.\nDisaster relief charities pleasing donors but leaving flimsy infrastructure. \nFair Trade certification scaling inequitably and edging out small farmers.\nNonprofit \"professionalization\" burning out staff and eroding authenticity.\nEdTech ventures reducing learning to standardized metrics, ignoring context.\n\nAcross these cases, we see the instrumental mindset fail - not for lack of good intention, but because of a fatal mismatch between means and ends. As Einstein observed, \"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\" Continuing to apply industrial-age tools of efficiency, control and standardization to the complex, soulful work of social change is a futile endeavor.\n\nShifting from Metrics to Meaning\nWhat's needed is a fundamental re-orientation - from metrics to meaning, from transaction to relationship, from extraction to regeneration. At its core, this is a shift from an industrial mindset of control and reductionism to an ecological one of participation and wholeness. It's a move from forcing outcomes to enabling the conditions for life to naturally thrive.\n\nThis can feel disorienting at first, even impossible. How do we operate without the comforting certainty of quantitative proxies? How do we justify our existence without legible impact stories? But as Father Greg Boyle demonstrates, real moral authority and transformative power arise from a deeper place. When asked about his impressive impact with gang members, he simply states, \"I don't hold any outcomes, I just hold people. I say, you are exactly what God had in mind when God made you. Then I sit back and watch the slow miracle unfold.\"\n\nHere we see both the means and the ends rooted in a profound, integral wholeness. Father Greg accesses a way of being so authentic and alive that it naturally invites others into their own aliveness. He's not running programs on people, he's in deep relationship with them - and that makes all the difference. Transformation emerges not through targeted interventions, but through the presence of unshakable love.\n\nGardening Aliveness \nFather Greg embodies a way of change that's less like engineering and more like gardening. An engineer seeks to impose an external design through force; a gardener creates the conditions for life to flourish in its own unique way. This calls for deep attunement - sensing what wants to grow, removing obstacles, providing nourishment. Not domination, but co-creation.\n\nIn nature, this leads to a resilient, regenerative diversity. A healthy garden requires far less external control to thrive than a monocrop plantation. Vitality arises from each element expressing its unique essence within a web of supportive relationships. Could we approach society this way - not as a machine to be optimized, but as a garden to be tended?\n\nThis points to a profound shift from controlling change to participating in an unfolding. From assembling parts to enabling wholes. It's a shift from interfering with the wisdom of life's natural rhythms to listening for the deep logic of emergence. From asking \"what can I force to happen?\" to \"what wants to happen, and how can I create the conditions for it to arise?\"  \n\nIn practice, this means slowing down to sense the seeds of potential waiting to sprout. It means attuning to the unique essence of people and places, and nurturing that to fruition. It means embracing uncertainty and organic timing rather than pre-determined outcomes and arbitrary deadlines. Most of all, it means trusting the innate drive within each person and community to grow towards wholeness when given a conducive environment.\n\nCultivating Inner Conditions\nThis outer shift, of course, requires inner work. We can't sustain an integral, ecological approach to change if we're still operating from fractured, mechanistic selves. As Gandhi urged, we must become the change we wish to see - not as a platitude, but as an embodied reality.  \n\nThis is where personal practices of connecting to our deeper sources of meaning become vital. We need to develop the capacity to sense the subtle aliveness moving within us, to discern the quiet voice of authentic calling beneath the clamor of ego and habit. This is a capacity that's been denigrated and suppressed in our overly-rational culture, yet it remains our truest guide.\n\nOne powerful gateway to accessing this inner knowing is through the gateway of emotions. As Bilal explains, emotions aren't just random feelings - they're illuminating the places where our current reality isn't aligned with our deepest values. Grief shows us what we love. Anger highlights where a boundary has been transgressed. Fear points to what we must protect. Each emotion, when met with gentle curiosity, reveals a hidden facet of what truly matters to us.  \n\nBy learning to befriend and listen to our emotions, we develop a felt sense of our unique sources of meaning. We get clearer on our \"want-to's\" - the things we're intrinsically motivated to do - in contrast with the \"have-to's\" imposed from without. As we align our actions with this inner knowing, we experience a growing coherence and aliveness. We access a deeper well of energy and insight for our work in the world.\n\nExperiments in Coming Alive\nThis inner/outer marriage of integrity and impact is a lifelong journey, not an overnight transformation. It proceeds not through grand pronouncements, but through humble experiments in truth. We begin where we are, with small daily choices to honor our authentic knowing. Postponing a deadline to pause and check in. Speaking a hard truth with care. Choosing courage over comfort when called to take a stand. Listening to the heart's guidance, even when the mind judges it as irrational.\n\nAs we take these steps, we discover that our inner knowing can be trusted - that it leads us towards greater aliveness, connection and efficacy. Tiny act by tiny act, we begin experiencing ourselves as part of life's interconnected dance rather than as separate controllers. This naturally shifts how we show up in our teams, organizations and systems. We listen more than we preach. We sense our way forward rather than imposing master plans. We embrace emergence rather than demanding certainty.\n\nGradually, in ways both subtle and seismic, we find our social impact work transforming from the inside out. Beneath the surface of spreadsheets and log frames, we're tending the soil of authentic relationship, shared purpose, and trust in life's regenerative impulse. Within the shell of existing structures, we're sowing seeds for the next paradigm to emerge.\n\nFrom Transactions to Relationships\nAs this embodied knowing permeates our organizations, we naturally begin operating from a partnership mindset. People cease being objects to change and become subjects of profound encounter. Our focus shifts from one-way service delivery to mutual transformation through relationship.\n\nPractically, this means restructuring funding to be based on partnership rather than paternalism. It means prioritizing authentic connection over transactional networking. It means designing programs through deep listening rather than top-down planning. Acknowledging that our destinies are intertwined, we approach change through the lens of \"power with\" rather than \"power over\".\n\nWhat arises is a richer, multi-directional flow of gifts - not just money, but wisdom, care, inspiration, and solidarity. Each person's unique contribution is honored, while all are held within the larger story of our shared becoming. No longer just givers and receivers, we're co-participants in nurturing the health of the whole.\n\nThe Wisdom of Enough\nA defining trait of this ecological mindset is knowing when enough is enough. Whereas the industrial model pursues endless growth, nature teaches balance and right proportion. As social impact practitioners, this means attuning to the real needs of a situation - not the insatiable hunger of organizational bloat or funders' arbitrary targets. \n\nThis is where inner and outer alignment becomes paramount. The more sourced we are in sufficiency, the less susceptible we are to chasing excess institutionally. We learn to measure success not by scale alone, but by depth, integrity, and catalytic impact. We become less attached to sustaining our particular organizations than to serving life's larger unfolding.    \n\nIn concrete terms, this means daring to refuse funding that would pull us out of integrity. It means getting radically honest about whether our programs are truly serving or simply self-perpetuating. It means defining success as growing people and partnerships to the point where they no longer need us. Powered by a deeper faith in the resilience of communities and the wisdom of life, we operate with open-handed humility rather than grasping control.\n\nTending Transformation\nThe path from metrics to meaning is ultimately one of ego-surrender. Of bowing into the unfathomable mystery at the heart of change, which will forever elude capture in our clumsy calculus of cause and effect. It's learning to trust that our worthiness isn't measured by outcomes achieved, but by the sincerity of our showing up. That true impact ripples out in ways we'll often never know.\n\nAs we step into this greater unknowing, we begin experiencing our work as a form of spiritual practice. Less forcing fruits than tending the soil of possibility. Less engineering outcomes than participating in the miracle of emergence. Less changing the world than changing ourselves to be in deeper service to its healing.\n\nThis isn't to abandon practicality for navel-gazing. Quite the opposite: it's unleashing a higher order practicality aligned with the wisdom of life. One that holds planning and acting lightly, ever responsive to shifting tides. One rooted in presence, that senses opportunities moment-to-moment. One committed to partnering with the innate intelligence of people and place.\n\nWhat arises is a social impact more akin to aikido than architecture. Instead of imposing pre-fixed designs, we sense the energies moving through a situation and redirect them towards greater health. We learn to fall in love with problems not as abstractions to solve, but as invitations into the heart of human and ecological relationships. We become artists of the emergent, midwifing surprising, context-born solutions by weaving connection and creatively holding space.\n\nSlowly, awkwardly, imperfectly, we're learning to be the land whales of history midwifing the next evolution of human society. One that rejects the false promise of mechanical control for the messy beauty of participatory belonging. One that partners with the wisdom in each person and place to enable widespread flourishing. One rooted in the innate regenerative impulse of life.\n\nThe journey is long and winding, full of unlearning and stumbling. But the vista ahead shimmers with a world where all people, beings and places are cherished as sacred. Where sufficiency and interdependence are guiding principles. Where the good of any part is known to be inseparable from the thriving of the whole. A world where our social impact isn't measured in numbers served, but in the authentic aliveness and care woven between us.\n\nIt's a world being born not through grand plans or technological solutionism, but through humble choices to embody its values in each unfolding moment. As adrienne maree brown wisely reminds us, \"How we're living every single day can be a huge contribution to transformation.\" May we tend this transformation faithfully in the small and large - trusting that the integrity of our means will guide us true in the end.",

As adrienne maree brown wisely reminds us, \"How we're living every single day can be a huge contribution to transformation.\" May we tend this transformation faithfully in the small and large - trusting that the integrity of our means will guide us true in the end.",

            "extracted_content": "# From Metrics to Meaning: A Personal Journey to Real Impact\n\n## Part I: The Moment Everything Changed\n\nI was watching Father Greg Boyle speak about his work with gang members at Homeboy Industries when something shifted fundamentally in how I understood social impact. When asked about his metrics, his theory of change, his impact assessment, he offered something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\"\n\nIn that moment, I realized how much of my own work had been instrumental – moving from community to community, project to project, always focused on scale and metrics rather than genuine relationship. I had been trying to solve problems rather than truly know people. Like many in social impact, I had unconsciously adopted a worldview that treats humans as means to ends, even when those ends are supposedly human wellbeing.\n\nThis realization led me to make a radical choice: to stop my peripatetic work and root myself deeply in Lebanon. Not because it was strategic, not because it would scale, but because real relationship requires presence. What followed transformed my understanding of what social impact truly means.\n\nOver years of building genuine relationships with refugees, former shoe-shiners, people living on the streets – many of whom are now dear friends – I learned what Father Greg already knew: real change happens through authentic connection, not programmatic intervention. When we treat people as means to achieving impact metrics, we miss what matters most.\n\n## Part II: The Crisis in Social Impact\n\nThis pattern of prioritizing metrics over meaning plays out everywhere in our sector. Consider the tragedy of microfinance in India. What began with Muhammad Yunus's recognition of human dignity devolved into a system where collection agents hounded farmers to suicide over loans as small as $100. The same repayment rates that earned institutions praise were destroying the very lives they claimed to improve.\n\nOr look at how international NGOs create thousands of refugee jobs while remaining silent when those same refugees face existential threats. The metrics look beautiful on paper, but something essential is missing. We've constructed stories about impact rather than allowing real meaning to emerge.\n\nI saw this pattern in my own work before Father Greg's words changed everything. At GEMSI, I was invited to speak on Al Jazeera about our impact. Despite our impressive metrics and frameworks, something felt inauthentic. We had built a narrative about change rather than creating conditions for real transformation.\n\nThis isn't just about ineffective programs. It's about a way of seeing that has forgotten half of what it means to be human. We've inherited a worldview that reduces everything to means and ends, inputs and outputs. From Descartes' separation of mind and world to modern economics treating humans as rational maximizers, we've built systems that actively suppress our capacity to recognize and create real value.\n\n## Part III: A Different Way of Seeing\n\nYet there's hope. My experience in Lebanon showed me what's possible when we trust relationship over metrics. When I opened my home and heart to genuine connection, transformation happened naturally. Not according to predetermined outcomes, but in ways more profound than any program could design.\n\nThis isn't just personal anecdote. Organizations worldwide are demonstrating what's possible when we trust our capacity to recognize meaning directly:\n\nConsider Barry-Wehmiller, a manufacturing company that during the 2008 recession chose reduced hours for all over layoffs – starting with executives. This wasn't just ethics – it was recognition that human dignity matters more than short-term metrics. The company emerged stronger, with industry-leading retention and a culture of genuine care.\n\nOr look at Buurtzorg in the Netherlands, which eliminated all middle management and metrics-based control in healthcare, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country.\n\nThese aren't just inspiring stories – they reveal a capacity we all have but have been taught to distrust. Every time we recognize beauty without analysis, every time we know something's right without calculation, we touch this ancient way of knowing.\n\nFor me, this realization has profound implications for how we at Bloom support social enterprises. Instead of pushing for scale and metrics first, we need to create conditions where meaning can emerge naturally. Instead of treating entrepreneurs as implementation vehicles for impact, we need to support them in building genuine relationships with their communities.\n\nThe path forward isn't abandoning metrics but recovering our trust in this deeper faculty of perception. Like stereoscopic vision, we need both ways of seeing to perceive depth. What we need are approaches that honor both our capacity for measurement and our ability to recognize quality directly."

      "content": " Here is the essay with quotes and sayings from different cultures and traditions integrated:\n\nFrom Metrics to Meaning: Cultivating an Alive Social Impact\n\n\"How you do anything is how you do everything.\" This simple insight captures a profound truth often overlooked in social impact work: our means shape our ends. The way we approach change - the mindsets, values and practices we embody - fundamentally influences the outcomes we create.  \n\nYet too often, the dominant approach is one of instrumental rationality, quantitative metrics, and a rush to scale. We push to demonstrate impact through numbers, to hit targets by the fastest means possible, to \"move fast and break things\" in pursuit of social good. But what if this very approach is undermining the ends we seek? As an African proverb warns, \"If you cut corners, you'll build a round house.\" When our means lack integrity, so too will our ends.\n\nThe Personal Cost of Inauthenticity\nThis question first arose for me viscerally when invited to speak about our work at Bloom on Al Jazeera. On paper, it was an opportunity to showcase our impact to a wide audience. But as I prepared, a deep unease grew within me. The metrics and talking points felt hollow, the story I was telling not quite true. It was as if I was being asked to perform impact rather than embody it. As Ralph Waldo Emerson observed, \"What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.\" My actions were betraying my deepest values.\n\nIn contrast, a moment of profound aliveness arose while watching Father Greg Boyle speak about his work with gang members at Homeboy Industries. When asked about his metrics, his theory of change, his impact assessment, he offered something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\" Here was real beauty, real transformation unfolding - and it had nothing to do with carefully constructed impact narratives. As an Indian proverb says, \"You cannot wash blood with blood.\" Instrumental means cannot yield integral ends. Father Greg showed me a different path.\n\nThese experiences revealed to me the price we pay when we contort ourselves to fit external expectations, when we sacrifice depth for speed and meaning for metrics. We lose touch with the very aliveness and integrity that fuel genuine, enduring change. As Lao Tzu wrote, \"When the shoe fits, the foot is forgotten. When the belt fits, the belly is forgotten.\" When our work aligns with our deepest sense of purpose, the ego falls away and service flows naturally.\n\nThe Systemic Costs of Instrumental Rationality \nThis misalignment between means and ends goes beyond the personal - it's embedded in the very DNA of many social impact organizations. Numerous organizations begin with genuine aims—providing relief, protecting the planet, empowering the vulnerable—yet adopt the same mechanistic worldview prevalent in corporate arenas. The results often backfire:\n\nMicrofinance institutions chasing repayment rates while fueling debt cycles.\nDisaster relief charities pleasing donors but leaving flimsy infrastructure.\nFair Trade certification scaling inequitably and edging out small farmers. \nNonprofit \"professionalization\" burning out staff and eroding authenticity.\nEdTech ventures reducing learning to standardized metrics, ignoring context.\n\nAcross these cases, we see the instrumental mindset fail - not for lack of good intention, but because of a fatal mismatch between means and ends. As Einstein observed, \"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\" Continuing to apply industrial-age tools of efficiency, control and standardization to the complex, soulful work of social change is, as a Buddhist teaching warns, \"using fire to put out fire.\" It only feeds the flames.\n\nShifting from Metrics to Meaning\nWhat's needed is a fundamental re-orientation - from metrics to meaning, transaction to relationship, extraction to regeneration. At its core, this is a shift from an industrial mindset of control and reductionism to an ecological one of participation and wholeness. It's a move from forcing outcomes to enabling the conditions for life to naturally thrive. As Lao Tzu wrote, \"Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.\"\n\nThis can feel disorienting at first, even impossible. How do we operate without the comforting certainty of quantitative proxies? How do we justify our existence without legible impact stories? But as Father Greg Boyle demonstrates, real moral authority and transformative power arise from a deeper place. He accesses a way of being so authentic and alive that it naturally invites others into their own aliveness. As Martin Buber articulated, \"All real living is meeting.\" Father Greg shows us how to lead with genuine encounter - and that makes all the difference. \n\nGardening Aliveness\nFather Greg embodies a way of change that's less like engineering and more like gardening. An engineer seeks to impose an external design through force; a gardener creates the conditions for life to flourish in its own unique way. This calls for deep attunement - sensing what wants to grow, removing obstacles, providing nourishment. Not domination, but co-creation. As a Chinese proverb states, \"All gardeners know that you cannot make a plant grow...The plant grows itself. What you do is provide the conditions for growth.\"\n\nIn nature, this leads to a resilient, regenerative diversity. A healthy garden requires far less external control to thrive than a monocrop plantation. Vitality arises from each element expressing its unique essence within a web of supportive relationships. Could we approach society this way - not as a machine to be optimized, but as a garden to be tended?\n\nThis points to a profound shift from controlling change to participating in an unfolding. It's a shift from interfering with the wisdom of life's natural rhythms to listening for the deep logic of emergence. From asking \"what can I force to happen?\" to \"what wants to happen, and how can I create the conditions for it to arise?\" As the Bhagavad Gita teaches, \"You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work...Desire for the fruits of work must never be your motive in working.\" When we release attachment to predetermined outcomes, we open to the larger intelligence moving through us. \n\nCultivating Inner Conditions\nThis outer shift, of course, requires inner work. We can't sustain an integral, ecological approach to change if we're still operating from fractured, mechanistic selves. As Gandhi urged, we must become the change we wish to see - not as a platitude, but as an embodied reality. Or as Thich Nhat Hanh encourages, \"The way out is in.\" The journey to authentic external impact begins with inner transformation.\n\nThis is where personal practices of connecting to our deeper sources of meaning become vital. We need to develop the capacity to sense the subtle aliveness moving within us, to discern the quiet voice of authentic calling beneath the clamor of ego and habit. This is a capacity that's been denigrated and suppressed in our overly-rational culture, yet it remains our truest guide. As Rumi wrote, \"Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.\"\n\nOne powerful gateway to accessing this inner knowing is through the gateway of emotions. As Audre Lorde expressed, \"Our feelings are our most genuine paths to knowledge.\" Emotions aren't just random sensations - they're illuminating the places where our current reality isn't aligned with our deepest values. Grief shows us what we love. Anger highlights where a boundary has been transgressed. Fear points to what we must protect. Each emotion, when met with gentle curiosity, reveals a hidden facet of what truly matters to us.\n\nBy learning to befriend and listen to our emotions, we develop a felt sense of our unique sources of meaning. We get clearer on our \"want-to's\" - the things we're intrinsically motivated to do - in contrast with the \"have-to's\" imposed from without. As we align our actions with this inner knowing, we experience a growing coherence and aliveness. We access a deeper well of energy and insight for our work in the world. As Howard Thurman counseled, \"Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.\"\n\nExperiments in Coming Alive\nThis inner/outer marriage of integrity and impact is a lifelong journey, not an overnight transformation. It proceeds not through grand pronouncements, but through humble experiments in truth. We begin where we are, with small daily choices to honor our authentic knowing. Postponing a deadline to pause and check in. Speaking a hard truth with care. Choosing courage over comfort when called to take a stand. Listening to the heart's guidance, even when the mind judges it as irrational. As an African teaching states, \"When you pray, move your feet.\" Embodiment is the foundation of integrity.\n\nAs we take these steps, we discover that our inner knowing can be trusted - that it leads us towards greater aliveness, connection and efficacy. Tiny act by tiny act, we begin experiencing ourselves as part of life's interconnected dance rather than as separate controllers. This naturally shifts how we show up in our teams, organizations and systems. We listen more than we preach. We sense our way forward rather than imposing master plans. We embrace emergence rather than demanding certainty. As the Tao Te Ching advises, \"Do you have the patience to wait until your mud settles and the water is clear? Can you remain unmoving until the right action arises by itself?\"\n\nGradually, in ways both subtle and seismic, we find our social impact work transforming from the inside out. Beneath the surface of spreadsheets and log frames, we're tending the soil of authentic relationship, shared purpose, and trust in life's regenerative impulse. Within the shell of existing structures, we're sowing seeds for the next paradigm to emerge. As Buckminster Fuller said, \"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\"\n\nFrom Transactions to Relationships  \nAs this embodied knowing permeates our organizations, we naturally begin operating from a partnership mindset. People cease being objects to change and become subjects of profound encounter. Our focus shifts from one-way service delivery to mutual transformation through relationship. As Martin Luther King Jr. declared, \"The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.\" When we lead with the spirit of genuine connection, that spirit comes to infuse the results.\n\nPractically, this means restructuring funding to be based on partnership rather than paternalism. It means prioritizing authentic connection over transactional networking. It means designing programs through deep listening rather than top-down planning. Acknowledging that our destinies are intertwined, we approach change through the lens of \"power with\" rather than \"power over\". As the African proverb reminds us, \"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\" Real impact is a product of right relationship.\n\nWhat arises is a richer, multi-directional flow of gifts - not just money, but wisdom, care, inspiration, and solidarity. Each person's unique contribution is honored, while all are held within the larger story of our shared becoming. No longer just givers and receivers, we're co-participants in nurturing the health of the whole. As Desmond Tutu taught, \"My humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together.\" In the crucible of authentic relationship, new possibilities are born.\n\nThe Wisdom of Enough\nA defining trait of this ecological mindset is knowing when enough is enough. Whereas the industrial model pursues endless growth, nature teaches balance and right proportion. As social impact practitioners, this means attuning to the real needs of a situation - not the insatiable hunger of organizational bloat or funders' arbitrary targets. It's what E.F. Schumacher called \"economics as if people mattered.\"\n\nThis is where inner and outer alignment becomes paramount. The more sourced we are in sufficiency, the less susceptible we are to chasing excess institutionally. We learn to measure success not by scale alone, but by depth, integrity, and catalytic impact. We become less attached to sustaining our particular organizations than to serving life's larger unfolding. As Lao Tzu wrote, \"He who knows he has enough is rich.\" From this place of essential simplicity, we more readily release what's no longer needed to embrace what's emerging.   \n\nIn concrete terms, this means daring to refuse funding that would pull us out of integrity. It means getting radically honest about whether our programs are truly serving or simply self-perpetuating. It means defining success as growing people and partnerships to the point where they no longer need us. Powered by a deeper faith in the resilience of communities and the wisdom of life, we operate with open-handed humility rather than grasping control. As adrienne maree brown advises in her book Emergent Strategy, \"Move at the speed of trust.\" When we stay close to the ground, listening and responding to the real wisdom in each context, the right structures naturally arise to meet the moment.\n\nTending Transformation\nThe path from metrics to meaning is ultimately one of ego-surrender. Of bowing into the unfathomable mystery at the heart of change, which will forever elude capture in our clumsy calculus of cause and effect. It's learning to trust that our worthiness isn't measured by outcomes achieved, but by the sincerity of our showing up. That true impact ripples out in ways we'll often never know. As Mother Teresa said, \"We can do no great things, only small things with great love.\" It's the quality of presence, not the quantity of output, that sows seeds of transformation.\n\nAs we step into this greater unknowing, we begin experiencing our work as a form of spiritual practice. Less forcing fruits than tending the soil of possibility. Less engineering outcomes than participating in the miracle of emergence. Less changing the world than changing ourselves to be in deeper service to its healing. As Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh offered, \"If we are too busy, if we are carried away every day by our projects, our uncertainty, our craving, how can we have the time to stop and look deeply into the situation - our own situation, the situation of our beloved one, the situation of our family and of our community, and the situation of our nation and of the other nations?\"\n\nThis isn't to abandon practicality for navel-gazing. Quite the opposite: it's unleashing a higher order practicality aligned with the wisdom of life. One that holds planning and acting lightly, ever responsive to shifting tides. One rooted in presence, that senses opportunities moment-to-moment. One committed to partnering with the innate intelligence of people and place. As the Bhagavad Gita counsels, \"Yogastha kuru karmani\" - established in being, perform action. From a grounded center, wise action arises naturally.  \n\nWhat emerges is a social impact more akin to aikido than architecture. Instead of imposing pre-fixed designs, we sense the energies moving through a situation and redirect them towards greater health. We learn to fall in love with problems not as abstractions to solve, but as invitations into the heart of human and ecological relationships. We become artists of the emergent, midwifing surprising, context-born solutions by weaving connection and creatively holding space. As Nora Bateson says, \"The future exists in the present, and the present exists in relationship.\" The more skillfully we tend the relational field, the more elegantly the future unfolds.\n\nSlowly, awkwardly, imperfectly, we're learning to be the land whales of history midwifing the next evolution of human society. One that rejects the false promise of mechanical control for the messy beauty of participatory belonging. One that partners with the wisdom in each person and place to enable widespread flourishing. One rooted in the innate regenerative impulse of life. As Rilke wrote, \"The future must enter into you long before it happens.\" By healing the story in ourselves today, we're already beginning to live into that more beautiful world our hearts know is possible.\n\nThe journey is long and winding, full of unlearning and stumbling. But the vista ahead shimmers with a world where all people, beings and places are cherished as sacred. Where sufficiency and interdependence are guiding principles. Where the good of any part is known to be inseparable from the thriving of the whole. A world where our social impact isn't measured in numbers served, but in the authentic aliveness and care woven between us. As Robin Wall Kimmerer writes in Braiding Sweetgrass, \"In some Native languages the term for plants translates to 'those who take care of us.'\" May we take care of all that takes care of us.  \n\nIt's a world being born not through grand plans or technological solutionism, but through humble choices to embody its values in each unfolding moment. Through getting proximately, uncomfortably real with ourselves and each other. Through apprenticing ourselves ever more deeply to the masterful creativity of life. Through daring to live the story we wish to see in the world. As Charles Eisenstein writes, \"We're all here to contribute our verse.\" May we make it a soulful one - for as Terry Tempest Williams reminds us, \"The human heart is the first home of democracy.\" The integrity of our social impact, and our collective future, grows from there.",

Tiny act by tiny act, we begin experiencing ourselves as part of life's interconnected dance rather than as separate controllers. This naturally shifts how we show up in our teams, organizations and systems. We listen more than we preach. We sense our way forward rather than imposing master plans. We embrace emergence rather than demanding certainty. As the Tao Te Ching advises, \"Do you have the patience to wait until your mud settles and the water is clear? Can you remain unmoving until the right action arises by itself?\"\n\nGradually, in ways both subtle and seismic, we find our social impact work transforming from the inside out. Beneath the surface of spreadsheets and log frames, we're tending the soil of authentic relationship, shared purpose, and trust in life's regenerative impulse. Within the shell of existing structures, we're sowing seeds for the next paradigm to emerge. As Buckminster Fuller said, \"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\"\n\nFrom Transactions to Relationships  \nAs this embodied knowing permeates our organizations, we naturally begin operating from a partnership mindset. People cease being objects to change and become subjects of profound encounter. Our focus shifts from one-way service delivery to mutual transformation through relationship. As Martin Luther King Jr. declared, \"The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.\" When we lead with the spirit of genuine connection, that spirit comes to infuse the results.\n\nPractically, this means restructuring funding to be based on partnership rather than paternalism. It means prioritizing authentic connection over transactional networking. It means designing programs through deep listening rather than top-down planning. Acknowledging that our destinies are intertwined, we approach change through the lens of \"power with\" rather than \"power over\". As the African proverb reminds us, \"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\" Real impact is a product of right relationship.\n\nWhat arises is a richer, multi-directional flow of gifts - not just money, but wisdom, care, inspiration, and solidarity. Each person's unique contribution is honored, while all are held within the larger story of our shared becoming. No longer just givers and receivers, we're co-participants in nurturing the health of the whole. As Desmond Tutu taught, \"My humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together.\" In the crucible of authentic relationship, new possibilities are born.\n\nThe Wisdom of Enough\nA defining trait of this ecological mindset is knowing when enough is enough. Whereas the industrial model pursues endless growth, nature teaches balance and right proportion. As social impact practitioners, this means attuning to the real needs of a situation - not the insatiable hunger of organizational bloat or funders' arbitrary targets. It's what E.F. Schumacher called \"economics as if people mattered.\"\n\nThis is where inner and outer alignment becomes paramount. The more sourced we are in sufficiency, the less susceptible we are to chasing excess institutionally. We learn to measure success not by scale alone, but by depth, integrity, and catalytic impact. We become less attached to sustaining our particular organizations than to serving life's larger unfolding. As Lao Tzu wrote, \"He who knows he has enough is rich.\" From this place of essential simplicity, we more readily release what's no longer needed to embrace what's emerging.   \n\nIn concrete terms, this means daring to refuse funding that would pull us out of integrity. It means getting radically honest about whether our programs are truly serving or simply self-perpetuating. It means defining success as growing people and partnerships to the point where they no longer need us. Powered by a deeper faith in the resilience of communities and the wisdom of life, we operate with open-handed humility rather than grasping control. As adrienne maree brown advises in her book Emergent Strategy, \"Move at the speed of trust.\" When we stay close to the ground, listening and responding to the real wisdom in each context, the right structures naturally arise to meet the moment.\n\nTending Transformation\nThe path from metrics to meaning is ultimately one of ego-surrender. Of bowing into the unfathomable mystery at the heart of change, which will forever elude capture in our clumsy calculus of cause and effect. It's learning to trust that our worthiness isn't measured by outcomes achieved, but by the sincerity of our showing up. That true impact ripples out in ways we'll often never know. As Mother Teresa said, \"We can do no great things, only small things with great love.\" It's the quality of presence, not the quantity of output, that sows seeds of transformation.\n\nAs we step into this greater unknowing, we begin experiencing our work as a form of spiritual practice. Less forcing fruits than tending the soil of possibility. Less engineering outcomes than participating in the miracle of emergence. Less changing the world than changing ourselves to be in deeper service to its healing. As Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh offered, \"If we are too busy, if we are carried away every day by our projects, our uncertainty, our craving, how can we have the time to stop and look deeply into the situation - our own situation, the situation of our beloved one, the situation of our family and of our community, and the situation of our nation and of the other nations?\"\n\nThis isn't to abandon practicality for navel-gazing. Quite the opposite: it's unleashing a higher order practicality aligned with the wisdom of life. One that holds planning and acting lightly, ever responsive to shifting tides. One rooted in presence, that senses opportunities moment-to-moment. One committed to partnering with the innate intelligence of people and place. As the Bhagavad Gita counsels, \"Yogastha kuru karmani\" - established in being, perform action. From a grounded center, wise action arises naturally.  \n\nWhat emerges is a social impact more akin to aikido than architecture. Instead of imposing pre-fixed designs, we sense the energies moving through a situation and redirect them towards greater health. We learn to fall in love with problems not as abstractions to solve, but as invitations into the heart of human and ecological relationships. We become artists of the emergent, midwifing surprising, context-born solutions by weaving connection and creatively holding space. As Nora Bateson says, \"The future exists in the present, and the present exists in relationship.\" The more skillfully we tend the relational field, the more elegantly the future unfolds.\n\nSlowly, awkwardly, imperfectly, we're learning to be the land whales of history midwifing the next evolution of human society. One that rejects the false promise of mechanical control for the messy beauty of participatory belonging. One that partners with the wisdom in each person and place to enable widespread flourishing. One rooted in the innate regenerative impulse of life. As Rilke wrote, \"The future must enter into you long before it happens.\" By healing the story in ourselves today, we're already beginning to live into that more beautiful world our hearts know is possible.\n\nThe journey is long and winding, full of unlearning and stumbling. But the vista ahead shimmers with a world where all people, beings and places are cherished as sacred. Where sufficiency and interdependence are guiding principles. Where the good of any part is known to be inseparable from the thriving of the whole. A world where our social impact isn't measured in numbers served, but in the authentic aliveness and care woven between us. As Robin Wall Kimmerer writes in Braiding Sweetgrass, \"In some Native languages the term for plants translates to 'those who take care of us.'\" May we take care of all that takes care of us.  \n\nIt's a world being born not through grand plans or technological solutionism, but through humble choices to embody its values in each unfolding moment. Through getting proximately, uncomfortably real with ourselves and each other. Through apprenticing ourselves ever more deeply to the masterful creativity of life. Through daring to live the story we wish to see in the world. As Charles Eisenstein writes, \"We're all here to contribute our verse.\" May we make it a soulful one - for as Terry Tempest Williams reminds us, \"The human heart is the first home of democracy.\" The integrity of our social impact, and our collective future, grows from there.",
