      "content": "Thanks for the photo! Here’s a quick review of your plants and which ones might prefer to be indoors, especially in direct summer sun in northern France:\n\n1. **Top right (Coffee plant - Coffea arabica)**: Prefers bright, indirect light. The strong midday sun could scorch its leaves—**bring it indoors or shade it**.\n\n2. **Middle (Peace Lily - Spathiphyllum)**: Thrives in indirect light and can suffer from too much sun. **Better indoors or shaded**.\n\n3. **Bottom right (Pilea peperomioides - Chinese money plant)**: Likes bright but indirect light. Some morning sun is okay, but prolonged direct sun can burn it. **Consider partial shade or indoors**.\n\n4. **Bottom middle (looks like a type of Dracaena or Dieffenbachia)**: Also prefers filtered light. **Avoid harsh direct sun**.\n\n5. **Bottom left (appears to be a Monstera or similar vine)**: Young leaves especially can burn in direct sun. **Filtered light or partial indoor placement** is better.\n\n6. **Middle back (Cyclamen, possibly)**: If it is a Cyclamen, they prefer cooler temps and indirect light. Summer heat can make them go dormant. **Indoors is better in summer**.\n\n**Summary:**\nMove most of them indoors or into filtered light during peak sun, especially between 11am–4pm. Morning light or shaded balcony corners are ideal.\n\nWould you like help arranging them for optimal sun exposure on your balcony?",

      "content": "Thanks for clarifying! Based on your question, you're likely referring to the tall plant with big leaves (avocado) and possibly the one with thinner, lighter green leaves (lemon). Here’s how to care for each in full northern France sun:\n\n---\n\n### **Avocado (Persea americana) – likely the large-leaved plant**\n- **Sun:** Loves sunlight! Can handle **full sun**, especially as it matures.\n- **Caution:** If it's a **young plant**, the strong afternoon sun might **scorch the leaves**. Gradually acclimate it if it’s been indoors.\n- **Recommendation:** **Leave it outside**, but consider some light shading in peak hours if the leaves start browning or curling.\n\n---\n\n### **Lemon (Citrus limon) – if that’s the smaller woody stem plant with light green leaves**\n- **Sun:** **Thrives in full sun** — it’s Mediterranean by nature.\n- **Needs:** At least **6–8 hours of sunlight daily** to stay healthy and fruit (eventually).\n- **Recommendation:** **Keep it outside**, water regularly, and make sure the pot drains well.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Avocado:** Yes, outdoors is great, but watch for leaf burn if it's young.\n- **Lemon:** Definitely outdoors in full sun — it's ideal.\n\nWould you like a mini sun/shade watering chart for all your balcony plants?",
