            "extracted_content": "Absolutely—here’s a focused review of the training deck you shared, grounded in the Insulation Trainer’s Feedback document and cross‑checked against the current slides (txt + pdf). I’ve included a concise 3 pros / 5 cons and then a 10‑slide “fix & reorganize” mini‑deck you can build immediately.\n\n3 things that are already working (pros)\n\nClear daily rhythm (Learn → Apply → Sell). This through‑line shows up consistently and gives participants predictable outcomes each day. It’s a strong adult‑learning scaffold already visible in Day‑1 slides.\n\nHands‑on demos are front‑and‑center. Incense leak tests, IR camera/thermal‑bridge hunt, and conduction/convection/radiation demos make abstract concepts tangible and are called out in the deck.\n\nRight problem framing for Iraq. You emphasize that ~60–70% of summer heat enters via the envelope (walls/roof/windows), priming the audience to target insulation first—good behavioral cueing.\n\n5 priority gaps to fix (cons)\n\nTerminology & translation awkwardness in the opener. “Myth‑Busting/Breaking Legends” and similar phrasing were flagged by Ghassan; use simple, correct AR/EN for Icebreaker (“كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker”).\n\nCost/energy math oversimplified. Current slides imply “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh × 800 IQD” flat pricing; Ghassan noted tiered tariffs and generator realities make this inaccurate. Switch to a kWh‑based, tier‑band example with ranges.\n\nPerformance over‑claims on thermal plaster. Slides list “withstands > 1000 °C” and “achieves 60% energy savings” without caveats. Per feedback: present as manufacturer data with limits (prep, thickness, application quality).\n\nEnglish‑first, long blocks. Trainer notes ask for Arabic‑first slides/trainer notes and shorter ≤3‑hour blocks; current materials are mostly English with long day blocks.\n\nMissing market/implementation realism. You touch XPS/EPS vs others, but still need: supplier quality variability, expiry checks, on‑site pitfalls (corruption/shortcuts), and a brief “what to do if” activity.\n\n10‑slide “Fix & Reorganize” mini‑deck (ready to build)\n\nGoal: implement the feedback while streamlining Day 1 flow:\nWhy now → How heat moves → Where to act → Which materials → How to choose/price → Hands‑on → Sell.\nEach slide below lists Purpose → Content → What to change (from today) → Asset pointers.\n\nSlide 1 – Welcome & Icebreaker (AR‑first)\n\nPurpose: Start on the right cultural note; fix terminology.\n\nContent: Title “أهلاً بكم – كسر الحاجز (Icebreaker)”. One prompt: “اذكر أسوأ أسطورة سمعتها عن التبريد/العزل؟”\n\nChange: Replace “Myth‑Busting/Breaking Legends” with “كسر الحاجز”; keep it light & bilingual.\n\nAssets: Reuse existing myth list; scrub odd English phrasing.\n\nSlide 2 – Why Insulation in Iraq—Right Now (evidence first)\n\nPurpose: Anchor urgency with one number and one image.\n\nContent: “في الصيف، 60–70% من الحرارة تدخل عبر الجدران/الأسقف/النوافذ.” One heatwave photo; quick “raise your hand” poll.\n\nChange: Keep the 60–70% message; tighten narration to 60 seconds.\n\nAssets: Your current Day‑1 context slides already contain this.\n\nSlide 3 – How Heat Moves (3 modes before materials)\n\nPurpose: Apply the “teach heat first” sequence.\n\nContent: Conduction / Convection / Radiation + 1 demo each (rod/ice, incense, IR image).\n\nChange: Move this before the big materials table; keep demos on one tidy slide.\n\nAssets: Existing demo slide—consolidate and simplify.\n\nSlide 4 – Where to Attack First (heat‑gain map)\n\nPurpose: Translate modes into a target order.\n\nContent: Roof (largest), Walls, Windows/Air‑leaks. Add “thermal bridges” call‑out with IR example.\n\nChange: Strengthen the thermal‑bridge visual and caption.\n\nAssets: Your “Heat Loss/Heat Gain” and IR references—just add the bridge caption.\n\nSlide 5 – Materials at a Glance (with local reality)\n\nPurpose: Give the menu, not the meal.\n\nContent: 5 tiles: XPS / EPS / Mineral wool / PU (spray) / Thermal plaster (لبخ حراري–Mantofly). Under each: best‑for, watch‑outs.\n\nChange: Explicitly add thermal plaster and mark XPS/EPS popularity vs. quality variance.\n\nAssets: “Meet the Materials” + new thermal plaster tile and real on‑site photo.\n\nSlide 6 – Safety & Claims (footnote the promises)\n\nPurpose: Avoid over‑promising; standardize safety talk.\n\nContent: “Manufacturer claims: fire up to ~1000 °C, ~20 dB, energy savings—verify on site.” Add prep/thickness/application caveat.\n\nChange: Add a small footnote wherever benefits are listed for Labkh/Mantofly; don’t headline “60% savings” without context.\n\nAssets: Reuse current plaster slides; append footnote box.\n\nSlide 7 – Real Photos, Not Icons (trust builder)\n\nPurpose: Replace stock icons with on‑site images.\n\nContent: Before/after shots of thermal plaster application, plus 1 short clip. Prompt: “أين ستكون أكثر فاعلية في بيتنا النموذجي؟”\n\nChange: Swap icons for real jobsite media.\n\nAssets: Insert Ghassan’s photos/video when available. (Slide placeholder already exists.)\n\nSlide 8 – Honest Money Math (tiered kWh, 3 scenarios)\n\nPurpose: Fix the “amps × IQD” simplification.\n\nContent:\n\nFormula block: Savings (IQD) = kWh_saved × tariff_band_rate\n\nThree quick ranges: Low / Medium / High tariff bands; add generator case (fuel /L × kWh/L).\n\nNote: “Use local tariff bands; don’t present a single price.”\n\nChange: Replace or demote “Every 1 kWh = 800 IQD; 1 amp ≈ 1 kWh” framing; present ranges and assumptions.\n\nAssets: Keep your calculator moments, but update the math instruction and labels.\n\nSlide 9 – Supplier & Quality Reality (checklists)\n\nPurpose: Stop failures before they start.\n\nContent: 2 checklists (one for material quality/expiry/date & storage; one for site risks: shortcuts/corruption → what to do if…).\n\nChange: Add the explicit expiry‑date check, real‑world pitfalls, and a mini role‑play.\n\nAssets: Insert as a one‑pager in Day‑2/3 where procurement appears.\n\nSlide 10 – Field Workflow & “My Bait” hand‑off\n\nPurpose: Tie training to a repeatable field process + data tool.\n\nContent: “Day‑by‑day sprint” (Client Discovery → Suppliers → BOQ → Co‑Design) + a 3–4 h My Bait tutorial slot and deliverables checklist.\n\nChange: Make the app onboarding explicit (timeboxed), not ad‑hoc.\n\nAssets: Use the Mosul Green Architecture Workbook day tabs as your visual pipeline and deliverables.\n\nQuick mapping: what to tweak in the current file(s)\n\nRename & re‑script the opener: “Welcome & Icebreaker / كسر الحاجز” (Slide 5 in pdf → rename + script excerpt in AR/EN).\n\nMove “Heat Moves” earlier: Place before “Meet the Materials.” (Reorder Day‑1 sequence per feedback.)\n\nThermal plaster tile: Keep benefits but add footnote box (“supplier data; depends on prep/thickness/application”). (Slides 30–33).\n\nReplace stock icons: Use site photos for plaster/ETIS steps (Slides 34–35).\n\nFix money math slide: Swap the fixed “800 IQD/kWh” & “1 amp≈1 kWh” with 3‑scenario kWh‑band ranges; add generator fuel path. (Slide 6 & “Spreadsheet moment”).\n\nArabic‑first variants: Produce AR‑first trainer notes and short AR summaries on each slide; trim session blocks to ≤3 h where possible.\n\nAdd quality/expiry checklist: New one‑pager inserted in Day‑2/3 procurement flow.\n\nWhy these changes map cleanly to your own feedback file\n\nTerminology / opener — explicit instruction to avoid odd translations and use “Icebreaker / Break the barrier.”\n\nTeach heat before materials — endorsed lesson order.\n\nHeat‑loss emphasis — keep the 60–70% top‑line to motivate insulation first.\n\nThermal plaster — add as a named option with real photo; Ghassan will share media.\n\nReal images/video — replace stock icons to build trust.\n\nMarket reality (XPS/EPS) — acknowledge why they’re common; discuss quality tradeoffs.\n\nETIS — keep it as a method; ensure Arabic term clarity.\n\nPerformance & safety — footnote manufacturer claims.\n\nCost/energy math — move away from naive amps→IQD; use kWh and tiers.\n\nArabic‑first & shorter sessions — address language and block length.\n\nSupplier quality/expiry & “what to do if” — add the practical checklists/role‑play.\n\nMy Bait / workbook integration — allocate a dedicated slot and user guide.\n\n(Optional) Two micro‑scripts you can paste now\n\nFootnote template for material claims (paste into bottom of any “benefits” slide):\n“Data points shown are from supplier/manufacturer sheets. On‑site performance depends on surface preparation, application quality, and installed thickness. Use as directional guidance, not a guarantee.”\n\nHonest money math sidebar (replaces “1 amp = 1 kWh” line):\n“Estimate savings with kWh and tariff bands. Present low/medium/high cases. For generators, compute kWh from fuel burn (L/h) and runtime.”\n\nSources I relied on (from your project files)\n\nInsulation Trainer’s Feedback (priority items, statuses, and slide‑level notes).\n\nYour current Day‑1 slides (pdf + txt) for structure, demos, and current money‑math framing.\n\nWorkbook (“Mosul Green Architecture Workbook 2.0”) to wire the My‑Bait/field‑workflow hand‑off.\n\nGhassan x Bilal discussion (translation issues, amp‑math concerns, thermal plaster inclusion).\n\nIf you want, I can turn the 10‑slide mini‑deck above into a ready‑to‑deliver pptx with the AR/EN microcopy and footnotes baked in—just say the word and I’ll build it to match your template.\n\nYou said:\n i didn't know you can make a pptx can you make the full - maybe 30-50 slide pptx? - don't do it just yet just tell me how \nChatGPT said:\n\nHere’s how I can make that full 30–50-slide PowerPoint deck for you — step-by-step, so you know exactly what’s involved before I start generating it:\n\n🧩 1. Source Integration\n\nI’ll merge insights from four files you’ve shared:\n\nCurrent slides (txt + pdf) — base structure and visuals\n\nTrainer Feedback (PDF) — slide-level corrections and new content priorities\n\nGhassan × Bilal Discussion Notes — authentic phrasing and translation guidance\n\nWorkbook (Mosul Green Architecture) — field workflow and deliverables for later slides\n\nThis ensures the new deck stays true to your Insulation Project standards.\n\n🧠 2. Structure\n\nThe new 30–50 slides will be organized like this:\n\nBlock\tFocus\tSlide Count (est.)\n1. Welcome + Icebreaker\tHadith reflection, cultural framing, “Break the barrier” activity\t5–6 slides\n2. Why Insulation Matters\tIraq heat data, cost math (tiered kWh), environmental link\t6–7 slides\n3. How Heat Moves\tDemos + thermal bridge visuals\t5 slides\n4. Materials & Methods\tUpdated comparison + thermal plaster + ETIS\t8–10 slides\n5. Field Application\tHome-Audit Sprint, quality checklist, corruption “what-if”\t6–8 slides\n6. Financial Reality & ROI\tWorkbook integration + new kWh bands\t4–6 slides\n7. Selling Trust\t“Invest once, not twice”, customer pitch role-play\t3–4 slides\n8. Reflection & Next Steps\tMy Bait tutorial intro, Day-by-Day summary\t2–3 slides\n🛠️ 3. How I’ll Build It\n\nI’ll use the Day 1–5 BEIT Template as the base style and generate the deck directly in .pptx format with:\n\nbilingual AR/EN slide titles, per trainer feedback\n\nsimplified terminology (“كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker”)\n\nfixed cost/energy math using kWh tiers\n\nfootnotes for material performance claims\n\nreal-world visuals (placeholders where Ghassan’s photos are pending)\n\nworkbook-based practical sections (“My Bait”, “BOQ ROI”)\n\n📤 4. Output Options\n\nYou can choose one of two deliverables:\n\nSingle .pptx file — ready to project or edit.\n\n.pptx + Trainer Notes (docx) — includes facilitator scripts, timings, and cues (like your Day 1 notes).\n\n⚙️ 5. What I’ll Need from You Before Generating\n\nTo make sure I hit the right tone and level of detail:\n\nTarget size: Do you want closer to 30 slides (concise) or 50 slides (fully detailed facilitator version)?\n\nAudience: Engineers vs. Trainers vs. Public homeowners ?\n\nLanguage mix: Arabic first + English subtitles, or English first with Arabic notes?\n\nVisual assets: Do you want me to include placeholders for Ghassan’s photos/videos, or skip those until you upload them?\n\nOnce you confirm those four points, I can generate the full PowerPoint in about 2 passes:\n\nPass 1: Outline + slide text (content blocks, visuals, notes)\n\nPass 2: Render to .pptx with formatting, design, and bilingual labels.\n\nWould you like the 30-slide concise version or the 50-slide full trainer version?\n\nYou said:\nexecutive_summary.md\nFile\nfeedback_mapping.md\nFile\ndesigner_brief_one_page.md\nFile\nslide_by_slide_implementation_guide.md\nFile\nfull facilitator with the learn apply and sell leveraging this content and this pptx that you can work on which is in your project files BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1-5 (BEIT Template)(To Share).pptx\nI'm attaching a few files here for some other ideas, although I want you to think for yourself before updating the PPTX, we should first do this: can you think about the best way to give me an easy and fast way to update the slides with detailed descriptions of the slides to create, change and how to reordering we need from the slides so ew can apply the suggestions from the trainers best as extracted from the transcripts and the insight sheet? you can also include direct case studies and quote slides, i think that would be very insightful and culturally helpful - i don't think we can do things like wind towers, it's not really in our pervue - we want to work on insulation undersanding and especially upgrades on existing homes - not only new construction. - yeah, and i also included the architecture training pdf (English BG updated Architecture - Day 1-5 (BEIT Template)(To Share) (1).pdf) slides in the project files for you to extract helpful things .remember our goal is retrotfitting energy consulting businesses focused on insulation, not solar, not reconstructing houses and building interior gardens. although green walls can be a thing, we want to focus on retrofitting as much as we can and help people learn and assess and apply and see the business case for mosul - we don' tnee dto be \"culturally sensitive \"because we are iraqis in mosul doing the training, so we don't need to pretend - best to bring in the real examples from the call transcrips \nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 4m 45s\n\nPerfect—before we touch the PPTX, here’s a fast, designer‑ready change kit that tells you exactly what to create, what to edit, what to delete, and how to reorder to apply the trainers’ guidance. It’s lean enough to act on immediately, but specific enough that any editor can update the deck without guesswork.\n\n0) What this plan is based on (so you can trust it)\n\nYour current deck “BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1‑5 (BEIT Template)(To Share).pptx” (slide numbers below refer to this file).\n\nTrainer insights (Ghassan/Omar/Muthanna) distilled into slide‑level fixes.\n\nExecutive redesign notes (what to cut, what to add, and why).\n\nDesigner brief + implementation guide (ready‑to‑paste content for many slides).\n\nTranscripts & discussion to anchor real quotes/case studies in Mosul context.\n\nSupporting “Day‑1” text/pdf exports (to map exact slide positions and problematic lines like “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh”).\n\nScope confirmed: retrofit insulation for existing homes (no wind towers; no solar), with LEARN → APPLY → SELL rhythm and business case for Mosul.\n\nA) Reorder the training (3‑hour daily rhythm)\n\nWhy: Trainers say 5‑hour blocks exhaust participants; aim for ≤3 h/day with tangible daily outcomes.\n\nReplace “Daily Agenda” with this fixed pattern on each day’s agenda slide:\n\nLEARN (45 min) — 1 big idea + 1 short demo\n\nAPPLY (75 min) — 1 hands‑on sprint with a named deliverable\n\nSELL (45 min) — 1 micro‑pitch or proof (photo/IR/ΔT/worksheet) to close the loop\n\nPut this schedule into a new slide “3‑Hour Daily Rhythm” and use it every day (Day 1 slot: replace current agenda slide around #8). Microcopy + structure already drafted in the redesign files.\n\nB) Slides to create (10 new slides that do the most work)\n\nBelow are titles, where to insert, what to show, exact copy cues, and which trainer insight it implements. Where helpful, I’ve referenced the existing slide you should insert after.\n\n1) Insulation is a Basic Right (AR‑first)\n\nInsert after: Slide 2 (Hadith) → becomes slide 3.\n\nShow: Split image “before/after family” + bilingual headline\nArabic: في الموصل، نعتبر العزل رفاهية — لكن هذا خطأ\nEnglish: “In Mosul, we treat insulation as a luxury — but this is wrong.”\n\nScript prompt: “What would your family do with +100k IQD/month?”\n\nImplements: Cultural reframing; strengthens WHY.\n\n2) Trainer Voices: Why This Matters (quote boxes)\n\nInsert after: new slide 1 above → becomes slide 4.\n\nShow: 3 quotes (Ghassan/Omar/Yahia) with headshots. Keep quotes to ≤25 words each; include Omar’s second‑floor test line.\n\nImplements: Use local authority; frames comfort > kilowatts.\n\n3) Second‑Floor Comfort Test (benchmark)\n\nInsert after: Slide 21–22 “Heat Gain Breakdown” and before “Your Home as an Energy Envelope” (#24).\n\nShow: Thermal before/after mock with headline:\n“إذا قدرت تعيش بالطابق الثاني… فأنت وصلت المرحلة الممتازة”\n“If the 2nd floor is livable in August, you’ve reached excellent level.”\n\nAdd: “Why 2nd floor is the test” bullets + ΔT numbers.\n\nImplements: Success metric & honest expectations (10–12 °C).\n\n4) Hall of Shame: When Insulation Goes Wrong (3 caselets)\n\nInsert after: “Meet the Materials” block (Slides 28–35).\n\nShow:\n\n4,000‑unit new build with no roof insulation → retrofit 5× cost\n\nZift/old bitumen disaster → toxic melt & redo\n\nReflective tile mistake → heats neighbor, forced removal\n\nAdd: Red Flag Checklist (Never use… Always check…).\n\nImplements: “Teach failure modes” and stop shortcuts.\n\n5) Comfort Over Kilowatts (reframe the pitch)\n\nInsert: Day 1 SELL section (≈ Slide 47–49 zone).\n\nShow: Two columns OLD TECH PITCH vs NEW HUMAN PITCH (health, sleep, pride, productivity, money). Include “under‑promise: 10–12 °C” note.\n\nImplements: Sales psychology per trainers.\n\n6) Real Mosul Stories (testimonials slide)\n\nInsert: After comfort pitch above.\n\nShow: Short 2–3‑line stories (e.g., Um Youssef medical costs, Abu Hamza WFH).\n\nImplements: Local credibility & social proof.\n\n7) kWh Tariff Bands: Honest Money Math\n\nInsert: Replace/adjacent to current “Why Heat = Money” slide (#6).\n\nShow:\n\nSavings (IQD) = kWh_saved × tariff_band_rate\n\nLow/Med/High tariff examples + generator fuel path (kWh from L/h).\n\nKill “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh; 800 IQD flat” line.\n\nImplements: Fixes common error trainers flagged.\n\n8) Quality & Expiry Checklist (procurement reality)\n\nInsert: Day 2 Apply block (materials).\n\nShow: Expiry date, storage, supplier training, warranty, onsite QA.\n\nImplements: Market reality & anti‑corruption prevention.\n\n9) Mixing Lab (bucket‑mark ratios + 24 h curing)\n\nInsert: Day 2–3 Apply block.\n\nShow: Bucket mark photo, weight equivalence, “mason demo only,” curing time clock (24 h).\n\nImplements: Practical accuracy & safety.\n\n10) Install‑First, Pay‑Later (trust‑building model)\n\nInsert: Day 5 Business section.\n\nShow: 30% materials + 70% after ΔT verification; phased roof→walls→sealing; “What‑if” corruption scenarios with scripts.\n\nImplements: Real‑world business model.\n\nC) Slides to modify (surgical edits with copy you can paste)\n\nThese are the fastest high‑impact fixes in your current Day‑1 slides.\n\nOpening / Icebreaker terminology\n\nSlide 5 title currently “Breaking the barrier of traditional construction.” Replace the earlier “Myth‑Buster/Legends” terminology everywhere with: “كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker”. Keep the toss activity, but rename it: “Myth Toss / رمي الأساطير” and simplify the myths list.\n\nWhy Heat = Money (Slide 6)\n\nRemove: “Every 1 kWh costs 800 IQD” and “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh for 1 hour.”\n\nReplace with the Tariff Bands slide spec in B‑7 above. Trainers asked for ranges & generator reality.\n\nBuilding Heat Gain Breakdown (Slide 22)\n\nKeep Roof 70% / Walls 20% / Leaks 10% but add a footnote:\n“Based on typical Mosul homes (concrete roof, hollow block walls, single‑pane windows). Your house may vary.”\n\nAdd Retrofit Priority Matrix below: Phase 1: Air sealing → Phase 2: Roof → Phase 3: Walls.\n\nMeet the Materials (Slides 28–32)\n\nConvert to a 5‑column table: Material / Best Use / Typical Cost / Red Flags / Available in Mosul?\n\nThermal plaster (Labkh/Mantofly): keep benefits but add a small footnote on every benefits slide:\n“Supplier/manufacturer data; performance depends on prep, thickness, application quality.” (this replaces over‑claims like “> 1000 °C” and “60% savings” as standalone promises).\n\nETIS term check (Slide 34)\n\nEnsure Arabic label is consistent “ETIS: نظام العزل الحراري الخارجي” and clarify “continuous wrap to kill thermal bridges.”\n\nYour Home as an Energy Envelope (Slide 24)\n\nKeep, but add humidity target box (40–60% RH) and explicitly tie to reduced AC runtime—your text draft already hints this; make it explicit.\n\nSafety First (Slide 37)\n\nKeep ladder rule/hydration; add “roof work without harness is common—use 4:1 ladder rule + spotter” (practical over theoretical PPE).\n\nSpreadsheet moments (Slides 43, 48)\n\nAbove the calculator tables, add “What could this money fund?” (school fees, medicine). This connects to SELL framing.\n\nD) Slides to delete or move (to hit the 3‑hour rhythm)\n\nCut any U‑value deep dives beyond the 5 you need (your Day‑1 already has a clean table—keep that; trim any repeats across days).\n\nMove line‑by‑line BOQ examples to a handout; keep only a single BOQ template slide in deck.\n\nConsolidate repetitive business theory into 3 slides max (include Install‑First/Pay‑Later + phased offers + objections flow).\n\nMove QR promo slides to end of Day‑5 only.\nThese cuts match the executive targets (192 → ~120 slides total; 3‑hour days).\n\nE) Quote & case‑study slides you can paste in\n\nTwo “ready” slides that use real trainer lines; keep each quote ≤25 words.\n\nSlide: Trainer Voices (Omar)\n\n“If you can make the second floor comfortable, you’ve reached excellent level.” — Omar Laith\n\nSlide: Trust Warning (Ghassan)\n\n“One bad job ruins 10 referrals—invest once, save long‑term.” — Ghassan (also echoed on Day‑1 slide 23)\n\nSlide: Zift Hall‑of‑Shame (caselet)\n\n“Old bitumen melted at ~50 °C; family paid twice to redo.” (Use warning icon + 2 bullet “real cost”.)\n\nSlide: 4,000‑Unit Disaster (caselet)\n\n“Zero roof insulation → 5× retrofit cost; property values ↓30%.” (Make it visual—before/after roof section.)\n\nSlide: Reflective Tile Mistake (caselet)\n\n“Shiny roof tiles cooked the neighbor’s windows—forced removal.” (Add “Reflection ≠ Reduction” note.)\n\nF) Find‑and‑Replace & micro‑copy fixes (15‑minute pass)\n\nMyth terms: replace “Myth‑Busting/Breaking Legends” with “كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker” everywhere.\n\nMoney math: purge “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh; 800 IQD flat” and any single‑price statements; replace with “Tariff bands + generator path.”\n\nThermal plaster claims: add small footnote under benefits (“supplier data; performance depends on prep/thickness/application”).\n\nArabic‑first: for every section title, add Arabic title first and keep concise English subtitle in smaller type.\n\nETIS term: unify Arabic naming; mention “continuous wrap” to kill bridges.\n\nG) Day‑by‑Day LEARN / APPLY / SELL micro‑blueprints (retrofit‑only)\n\nKeep these as section cover notes for each day—one slide each.\n\nDay 1 – Understanding Heat & Trust\n\nLEARN: Iraq heat trend; 3 modes; heat‑gain map; 2nd‑floor test.\n\nAPPLY: Home‑Audit Sprint (temps, leaks, generator amps).\n\nSELL: Comfort‑first pitch + tariff‑band savings; record 30‑sec hook.\n\nDay 2 – Roofs & Materials (retrofit focus)\n\nLEARN: XPS/EPS/mineral wool/PU + thermal plaster incl. red flags.\n\nAPPLY: Mixing Lab + Quality & Expiry checks; mini‑tile ΔT tests.\n\nSELL: “Cheap‑now = pay‑later” with live ΔT and ROI.\n\nDay 3 – Walls, Windows & BOQ (retrofit)\n\nLEARN: ETIS basics; WWR limits; sealing priority.\n\nAPPLY: BOQ template only + supplier quotes;

The content and sequencing follow the redesign plan we agreed (LEARN → APPLY → SELL), and the changes implement the trainer feedback and action plan.\n\nWhat changed relative to your current deck (traceable to your documents)\n\nPacing & structure: The 3‑hour daily rhythm replaces long blocks; every day ends with a concrete SELL deliverable.\n\nFraming slides: Added “Insulation is a Basic Right” and “Trainer Voices” to set local, retrofit‑focused context.\n\nBenchmark: Second‑Floor Comfort Test slide gives a pass/fail goal trainees can sell.\n\nMoney math fix: Replaced the flat “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh; 800 IQD” with Tariff‑Band math and generator fuel path. (You can drop in local rates pre‑session.)\n\nMaterials realism: Kept XPS/EPS/Mineral Wool/PU/thermal plaster; added red‑flag warnings and footnotes on claims.\n\nFailure mode education: Hall of Shame (4,000‑unit disaster, zift meltdown, reflective tile mistake) + red‑flag checklist.\n\nQuality control: Mixing Lab (bucket‑mark ratios, 24 h curing) + Quality & Expiry checklist.\n\nRetrofit priority: Sealing → Roof → Walls matrix; ETIS clarified as external wrap (bridges reduction).\n\nBusiness model: Install‑First/Pay‑Later, objection handling, evidence packs, 30‑day launch plan, WhatsApp accountability.\n\nQuick notes for trainers\n\nDrop‑in media: Several slides have placeholders for Ghassan’s on‑site photos (thermal plaster application, coating failure, tile lab). Replace placeholders with real images when available.\n\nTariff table: Before each cohort, enter current kWh band rates (and generator conversion) in the “Honest Money Math” table; the deck intentionally avoids a single flat IQD figure.\n\nArabic‑first: Section titles are bilingual with Arabic first, per trainer guidance.\n\nIf you want micro‑tweaks (e.g., slotting a specific supplier name set from Mosul, or swapping in your preferred Arabic phrasing on 2–3 headers), tell me the lines to change and I’ll update the BEIT‑themed deck right away. \n\nYou said:\nok, now let's review the workbook nad update it to align with these slides and make a new xlsx - you can check the work book we uploaded in the project docs - the tariff table is here attached \nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 10m 50s\n\nDone—here’s a clean, tariff‑aware workbook that matches your slides and the BEIT “Learn → Apply → Sell” flow, using the same yellow/green theme:\n\n👉 Download the Excel: BEIT_Insulation_Tariff_Calculator_v2.xlsx\n\nWhat I built (and why)\n\n1) Tariff engine with slabs (MOE vs KRG/Ronaki).\n\nMOE–Domestic: 10 IQD (0–1500 kWh), 35 (1501–3000), 80 (3001–4000), 120 (>4000).\n\nMOE–Commercial: 60 (0–1000), 80 (1001–2000), 120 (>2000).\n\nOther MOE categories: Government 120; Industrial 60; Agricultural 60 (flat).\n\nKRG/Ronaki–Domestic: 72 (0–400), 108 (401–800), 175 (801–1200), 265 (1201–1600), 350 (>1600).\n\nKRG/Ronaki–Commercial 185 (flat); Government 160; Industrial 160 (and “Industrial‑Large” 125); Agricultural 60.\nThis directly reflects the images you shared so the workbook reproduces your slide math instead of using a naïve “amps × price” shortcut (Ghassan’s request) and ties cost to kWh using tiered slabs.\n\n2) Generator reality: Amps → kWh → monthly bills.\nA “Generator_Calc” sheet converts amps to kWh (default 220 V, 24 h/day, 30 days), then prices each scenario under MOE and KRG for the Commercial category—the same comparison table in your slide. The 5A→30A rows match your posted figures (differences ≤ 250 IQD are rounding). This fits Day 1’s “Generator Reality Calculator / Savings Math” and makes your cost examples defensible.\n\n3) Drop‑in to your BEIT pipeline.\nThe workbook mirrors your existing structure (Customer Intake → Energy Calculator → Quote Generator → Project Tracker), so you can paste a client’s monthly kWh and immediately show “MOE vs KRG” bills and the delta in your Quote.\n\n4) Visuals/theme.\nSheets use the same yellow/green accenting as your training deck for faster recognition in class.\n\nWhat’s inside (sheet‑by‑sheet)\n\nTariffs\nAll slab bands with IQD/kWh rates for MOE and KRG (Ronaki), by category.

Show “Calculator” with a simple 2,000 kWh/month example and click through the slab breakdown. Reinforces Heat → AC hours → Bills → Insulation First.\n\nApply. Switch to “Generator_Calc,” set Hours/Day to what the neighborhood actually gets (e.g., 12–18 h), and price 5A/10A… to produce local bills that match participants’ experience. No “amps × price” shortcuts.\n\nSell. Use the delta between MOE and KRG (or between before/after kWh) to build the Pain‑to‑Price story in your Quote Generator and Day 1 sell cards—“Invest once, not twice.”\n\nHow to merge this into your master BEIT workbook\n\nYour current workbook already routes Customer Intake → Energy Calculator → Quote Generator → Project Tracker. Add these connections:\n\nCopy the sheets “Tariffs”, “Calculator”, “Generator_Calc”, “Notes & Assumptions” into the main file.\n\nIn Energy Calculator, add three yellow input cells:\n\nTariff_System (drop‑down: MOE (Federal) / KRG (Ronaki))\n\nTariff_Category (drop‑down: Domestic/Commercial/…)\n\nMonthly_kWh (from your audit/app or meter)\n\nLink your Quote:\n\nMonthly Bill (IQD) → =Calculator!C7\n\nAvg Rate (IQD/kWh) → =Calculator!C8\n\nMonthly Savings → Before − After (or MOE − KRG, depending on scenario).\n\nIn Project Tracker, store the chosen tariff context (so follow‑ups keep the same assumptions).\n\nIf you prefer a single‑cell Excel formula for slabs, you can also compute per‑band kWh as\nMAX(0,MIN(kWh,Upper)−Lower) for each row in Tariffs, multiply by its Rate, and SUMPRODUCT—but the included “Calculator” sheet already shows this breakdown transparently.\n\nWhy this matches the trainers’ guidance\n\nOrder + emphasis. We model cost properly after teaching heat movement and where gains come from (60–70% via walls/roof/windows), then connect to ROI and quotes.\n\nNo over‑promising.

Here’s a tight plan that 1) settles the “roof‑first?” question with what’s actually doable on Mosul’s flat concrete roofs, 2) reorders the deck so it tracks your calculator and the Architecture insights, and 3) specifies exactly what to add/change on each slide (using the same theme as your PPTX).\n\n1) Should we focus on the roof first? And can we retrofit flat concrete roofs?\n\nShort answer: Yes—start with the roof when access and height allow, and you do not need to break the slab. Several retrofit paths fit Mosul’s flat RC roofs.\n\nWhy roof-first: Your current deck already frames the roof as the largest single heat path (Roof ≈ 70%, Walls ≈ 20%, Air leaks ≈ 10%) with indicative costs and ROI, which is the right starting hypothesis to test per site.\n\nWhat interviews & trainer notes say:\n\nTeach how heat moves before talking materials; keep the roof/walls/windows emphasis (~60–70% of summer heat via the envelope) to motivate insulation.\n\nUse real materials/jobs (e.g., Labkh/Mantofly thermal plaster) and ETIS as concrete options; avoid over‑promising, show limits and use‑cases.\n\nAvoid naïve “amps × IQD” math; Iraq tariffs are tiered—use kWh‑based or tariff‑table methods in the calculator.\n\nOn‑the‑ground options for flat RC roofs (no slab demolition):\n\nCool‑roof coating (white/reflective)\nPros: lowest cost/skill; quick comfort gains.\nCons: durability varies; must specify UV‑stable, correct prep; your “Ghassan’s coating failure” slide is the cautionary tale—cheap coatings peel and kill trust.\n\nInverted roof (XPS above waterproofing) with pavers/screed\nPros: proven on flat RC roofs; continuous insulation; serviceable; no interior disruption.\nNotes: check added height vs thresholds/parapets; ensure drainage. Your material price points already list XPS 50 mm ≈ 15,000 IQD/m², matching the deck’s “typical fix cost” order‑of‑magnitude.\n\nSpray polyurethane foam (SPF) + UV topcoat\nPros: insulation + air/water sealing in one; conforms around penetrations.\nNotes: needs trained crew; add UV‑stable coat (quality/spec matter—tie to the failure slide).\n\nVentilated over‑roof / shade canopy\nPros: strong radiative + convective cut; no wet work; good when parapet height is tight.\nNotes: treat as “double roof”; include wind bracing; works well over occupied homes.\n\nInterior drop‑ceiling with mineral wool / boards (when exterior access is impossible)\nPros: avoids roof height issues.\nNotes: handle vapor control to prevent condensation; doesn’t stop solar heating of slab, but reduces downward heat to rooms.\n\nBottom line: If you can add height and reach the roof, go Roof first (Inverted roof or SPF). If not, do Air‑sealing + west/east wall upgrades + shading first, and use cool‑roof as the quick win with a strong durability spec to avoid repeat work. Your Architecture deck also puts “Roofs & Realistic Wins” early (Day 3), which we’ll mirror in the insulation deck flow.\n\n2) Re‑ordering the training so it aligns to the calculator and Architecture insights\n\nWe’ll keep your Learn→Apply→Sell rhythm but expand to a full‑day (or two‑day) delivery with ~40–50 slides. The re‑order leverages what you already have and what the trainers asked for.\n\nNew macro‑flow (what participants do, and when)\n\nFrame & Facts\n\nWhy insulation now (heat & cost pressures), then how heat moves.\n\nPull forward your envelope/heat‑modes content and fix translations per trainer note.\n\nDecide where to start (Roof‑first Decision Tree)\n\nAdd a 1‑slide decision tree (access? height? leakage? budget?) to select roof vs wall vs air‑sealing first step.\n\nMaterials with market reality\n\nKeep core materials (XPS/EPS/PU/mineral wool) plus Labkh/Mantofly and ETIS, with real job photos.\n\nCalculator‑driven scoping\n\nApply Audit → Calculator → BOQ → Quote pipeline already in your deck, but hook it to tiered tariffs and a roof option set (see Section 3).\n\nSell with trust\n\nKeep “Invest once, not twice” and the coating‑failure case; add two short quotes from the Ghassan call on translation clarity and cost math caution.\n\nCase‑study & objection handling\n\nShow one roof retrofit micro‑case (before/after temps; cost; payback), and a wall + air‑seal micro‑case for homes where roof height is constrained.\n\n3) Slide‑by‑slide “update manifest” (use the same theme)\n\nBelow, “[NEW]” means create a new slide. All other entries reference slides in BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1‑5 (BEIT Template).\n\nOpen & framing\n\nS5 “Breaking the barrier…” → Rename to “Welcome & Icebreaker (Break the barrier)”; fix translation per trainer note. Add 1 sub‑bullet: “Say your name + 1 heat myth you’ve heard.”\n\nS6 “Why Heat = Money” → Keep, but add a footer: “We’ll use tariff tables in the calculator—no flat ‘amps × IQD’.”\n\nFacts first\n\nS12–S16 (Why insulation / Rising temps / Energy & CO₂) → Keep sequence; ensure the 60–70% envelope line is spoken, not over‑promised.\n\nS21 “Building Heat Gain Breakdown” → Keep the Roof 70 / Walls 20 / Air 10 graphic. Add a right‑hand “Check before roof‑first” list: access? height margin? active leaks? tenant constraints?

(This replaces any flat “800 IQD/kWh” shortcuts flagged by trainers.)\n\nRoof options table (NEW):\n\nColumns: Option | Added Height (mm) | U_before | U_after | ΔU | SRI_before | SRI_after | Moisture/Leak Fix? (Y/N) | Unit Cost IQD/m² | Life (yrs).\n\nPre‑fill example rows: Cool‑roof, Inverted XPS 50 mm, SPF+topcoat, Ventilated over‑roof, Interior drop‑ceiling.\n\nSeed Unit Cost for XPS 50 mm = 15,000 IQD/m² (from your Supplier tab).\n\nCalculator changes:\n\nAdd U_Roof_before/after, ΔQ_roof = Area_roof × (U_before − U_after) × ΔT.\n\nConvert ΔQ to kWh and multiply by selected tariff for MoE or Ronaki.\n\nShow Payback (months) = Roof_Capex / Monthly_Savings_IQD.\n\nKeep the Audit → Calculator → BOQ → Quote flow already shown in the deck.\n\nQuote sheet (update):\n\nAdd Durability proof fields (photo link, spec sheet, warranty text), so sellers can back “Invest once” with evidence (ties to Ghassan’s case).\n\n5) Ten new slides to drop in (ready‑to‑build content)\n\nMyth vs Fact: “You can’t retrofit a flat concrete roof.”\nFact: You can—via inverted XPS above waterproofing, SPF+topcoat, or ventilated over‑roof; choose per height/leak/access.\n\nRoof‑First Decision Tree.\n4 questions → 4 pathways as described above.\n\nRoof Retrofit Options at a Glance.\n5 options table with “When to use / What to watch”.\n\nSpec the Roof Right (Durability First).\nConnect to the coating failure; list prep/UV/penetration/drainage checks.\n\nMarket Reality—What’s Available in Mosul.\nEPS/XPS are common and cheap; compare with PU/mineral wool/Labkh‐Mantofly—pros/cons in bullets.\n\nETIS in 60 seconds (for walls).\nPhoto + layer diagram; one‑line benefit: “wraps the bridges.”\n\nCalculator Hook—Where to Click.\nScreenshot callouts: select Tariff source, pick Roof option, see ΔU → kWh → IQD; mirrors the new workbook fields.\n\nMosul Micro‑Case: Roof First.\nBefore/after temps at ceiling; cost (IQD/m²); payback; 1 photo; 2‑line narrative (use your participants’ audits once you have them).\n\nWhen Roof Isn’t First.\nWest wall + shading + air‑sealing micro‑case; quick ROI; sets expectations.\n\nTwo Quotes to Build Trust.\n\nTrainer clarity on Arabic terms (short line from Ghassan).\n\nTrainer caution on tariff math.\n\n6) What to say in the room (trainer cheat‑lines, grounded in your files)\n\n“We teach heat flows first, then pick materials that slow those paths, exactly as the trainers asked.”\n\n“The roof is often the biggest driver in our climate (your deck shows Roof ≈ 70%), but we confirm access/height/leaks before committing.”\n\n“We do not multiply amps by a flat IQD rate; we use tiered tariffs in the calculator.”\n\n“Use real job photos (Labkh/ETIS/coatings) rather than icons—to build trust.”\n\n“Our Architecture flow also emphasizes roofs early—so both tracks stay in sync.”\n\n7) Quick answers you can put on a Q&A slide\n\nQ: “We can only paint roofs white—true?”\nA: No. You can also add insulation above the slab (inverted roof), spray foam + topcoat, or build a ventilated over‑roof. Choose based on height, leaks, and access.\n\nQ: “Do I have to break the concrete to insulate?”\nA: No. All three methods above are over‑clad solutions.\n\nQ: “When would you not start at the roof?”\nA: When height is limited, active leaks require membrane replacement first, no access, or tenant constraints make interior work easier. Then start with air‑sealing + west/east walls and add cool‑roof as a quick win (but specify it properly to avoid peeling like in Ghassan’s case).\n\nWhat I changed this plan against in your project files\n\nRe‑sequenced “Heat moves → Materials,” emphasised by trainers.\n\nKept and strengthened the Roof 70 / Wall 20 / Air 10 frame with a decision tree and roof methods, not just white paint.\n\nPulled in ETIS and Labkh/Mantofly, with responsible specs language.\n\nSynced to the Architecture deck’s “Roofs & Realistic Wins” phase.\n\nCorrected the cost math approach to respect tiered tariffs, per interview and feedback.\n\nKept the existing Audit → Calculator → Quote pipeline and made it the backbone for all activities.\n\nIf you want, I can now turn this into the actual slide content (same theme), and produce a matching workbook (with the tariff tables and roof options pre‑wired), but the plan above gives you everything needed to update immediately.\n\nYou said:\nyeah, sounds good can you do that - update the slides and workbook and return it?\nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 9m 38s\n\nDone — I updated the slides using your existing BEIT theme and rebuilt the workbook to include tiered tariffs (MoE vs Ronaki), roof‑retrofit reality, ROI by measure, and trainer‑quote slides. Both files are ready:\n\nUpdated slide pack (PPTX) — “Update Pack v3” you can use standalone or insert into your current deck:\nDownload the updated slide pack\n\nWorkbook v2.1 (XLSX) — with tariff sheets & calculator aligned to the slides:\nDownload the workbook v2.1\n\nWhat I changed (fast map)\n\nA. Slide updates that matter for Mosul retrofits\n\nRoof‑first clarity + numbers. New slide “Heat Gain Breakdown (Mosul—Retrofit Priority)” fixes the message to Roof ≈ 70% → Walls ≈ 20% → Leaks ≈ 10%, matching the module narrative and trainers’ emphasis on prioritization.\n\n“Roof Retrofit Reality” (for concrete flat slabs). A practical menu you can actually sell without breaking the slab:\nA) white elastomeric/ceramic cool roof coating (with primer & thickness),\nB) inverted roof (XPS above slab + waterproofing + protective screed),\nC) insulated screed overlay,\nD) drop ceiling with mineral wool/XPS (if you can spare headroom),\nE) ventilated shade roof/canopy.\nThis directly addresses the “can we even retrofit the slab?” confusion. Trainers asked us to teach a quick area‑vs‑cost decision so teams know when roof vs walls makes sense; the new slide follows that.\n\nQuality & trust. Slide with Ghassan’s coating failure (peeled in two weeks) and the 30/70 “Install‑First / Pay‑After‑Proof” policy for trust. This goes with the trainer request to avoid cheap products, check expiry dates, and prove ΔT with the customer.\n\nReal local prices & materials. A compact “Local Materials & Typical Market Prices (2025)” slide (coatings, XPS/EPS, perlite plaster, ETIS, air‑sealing) with a note to verify expiry. Thermal plaster (Labkh Ḥarrāri/Mantofly) is called out per feedback.\n\nTariffs are tiered (not flat!). Two slides:\n\n“Tariff Reality — Use tiered kWh, not Amp × flat price.”\n\nTwo inserted images from your tariff tables (Domestic tiers + Commercial comparison).\nTrainers specifically asked us not to use naïve amp→IQD math; the new content and workbook fix that.\n\nCalculator alignment slides. “Calculator Alignment — Example” is keyed to workbook v2.1 so a 15‑amp case shows MoE vs Ronaki monthly costs with tiering (matches your comparison table rows).\n\nSecond‑floor success metric. “Second‑Floor Comfort Test — ΔT ≤ 3 °C” with the trainer’s quote (“If you can make the second floor livable, you’ve reached excellent level”) so teams sell comfort the family can feel upstairs.\n\nCase Study slides. Wifaq’s 17 °C transformation + “Stories that sell” block (numbers + human outcome), drawn from the interviews/quote map.\n\nSales enablement. Objection handling Top 5 and Week‑1 Launch Plan (Audit 3 → Convert 1) so graduates actually start businesses next week.\n\nNote: Your current deck already contains the Day‑1 through Day‑5 backbone; the update pack respects that same visual theme (I built it on your BEIT template and kept Learn→Apply→Sell pacing). Use the delete/move guidance in the implementation guide to remove duplicates and keep sessions tight.\n\nB. Workbook v2.1 — what’s new & how to use it\n\nTARIFFS_2025: side‑by‑side MoE Domestic (10/35/80/120 IQD/kWh bands), Ronaki Domestic (72/108/175/265/350), MoE Commercial (60/80/120), Ronaki Commercial (modeled as 185 flat per your table). If you receive updated official brackets, just edit this sheet.\n\nTariff_Calc: enter a monthly kWh and select a regime → blended monthly cost with proper tiering (no more flat Amp×price).\n\nComparison_Commercial_Amps: the same 5A–30A table from your slides; good for quick teaching moments and quotes.\n\nRetrofit_Options: one‑pager with typical costs (IQD/m²) & simple payback for air‑sealing, roof, walls to match the slides/quotes.\n\nREADME_v2_1: “what’s new” + a 1‑2‑3 to run tariff and ROI numbers.\n\nOpen Tariff_Calc → put monthly kWh in B3 and choose the regime in B4 to get the right monthly IQD. Copy that to your quote. (This change implements the trainer request to stop using over‑simplified amp→IQD conversions.)\n\nThe workbook structure and “one‑tab‑per‑day” rhythm remains consistent with your v2.0 workbook and the architecture training’s emphasis on real deliverables (client intake → evidence → ROI → pitch).\n\nThe roof question — what interviews + field reality say, and how we updated the deck\n\nShould we focus the roof first if we can’t ‘insulate’ it after construction?\nYes — roof first remains correct for most Mosul concrete houses because the roof is the dominant heat‑gain path in summer (≈ 70%). Trainers asked us to teach a clear area‑vs‑cost logic so roof vs wall decisions are transparent. We therefore show five retrofit paths that do not require breaking the slab, plus a quick decision tree (waterproofing, headroom, budget, load, shading).\n\nWhat’s actually possible on a flat concrete slab?\n(1) White cool‑roof coating — fast, low mass. Needs proper prep, primer, correct film thickness, and expiry‑date checks (we added this to prevent repeat of Ghassan’s peel‑off case).\n(2) Inverted roof (XPS above slab) — very effective; may need parapet height and drain extensions.\n(3) Insulated screed overlay — lighter cement with insulation aggregate; seals to weather layer.\n(4) Interior drop ceiling — fastest inside solution if external changes aren’t allowed; mind headroom.\n(5) Ventilated canopy/shade roof — cuts solar radiation without touching the slab.\nThese map to real materials available in Mosul (XPS/EPS, perlite/thermal plaster, coatings), which trainers asked us to demonstrate with local suppliers and samples.\n\nSales wording the team can use (from the interview quote map):\n“We install ABOVE the roof slab whenever possible so heat is blocked before the concrete stores it.” This message is now embedded on the slide and in facilitator notes.\n\nWhere the new content comes from (why you can trust it)\n\nPriority, trust, and roof‑first messaging are lifted from the trainer feedback + quote map (e.g., “roof ≥ 70% heat → roof first”; “avoid naïve amp cost math; use tiered tariffs”).\n\nThe Day‑1 to Day‑5 spine and “Learn→Apply→Sell” rhythm already exist in your BEIT deck and architecture deck; I kept that structure and simply tightened/realigned it.\n\nLocal prices, success stories, and week‑1 launch plan are taken from the comprehensive update & quote map docs, so teams can go from training to their first two quotes next week.\n\nHow to roll it out (practical)\n\nUse the Update Pack v3 as a ready-made section in your next delivery (roof reality → tariffs → calculator → trust → case study → objections → launch plan).\n\nIn your existing deck, remove duplicates and move the “Explore More BEIT” QR slide to the end of Day 5 per the implementation guide.\n\nIn class, have teams: (a) run a 15A example in Tariff_Calc, (b) choose a roof option from the decision tree, (c) write the 30‑sec pitch using the case‑study slides — that ties Learn → Apply → Sell in one block."

Inverted roof), SELL proof slides and quotes embedded.\n\nXLSX v3: Tariff bands, generator calc, roof options (with XPS 50 mm default), quote generator with 30/70 terms, supplier & expiry hub, tracker.\n\n9) Any open questions already resolved by your interviews & docs\n\n“Roof first even if it’s already built?” — Yes, with over‑roof solutions (coatings, inverted XPS, SPF, ventilated canopy, or interior drop ceiling). Add height/drainage checks to spec.\n\n“Above or below the slab?” — Above. Teach and show it.\n\n“Tariffs math: amps × flat price?” — No. Use slabbed kWh tariffication with MoE/Ronaki switch & generator path.\n\nReady to implement?\n\nIf this change map looks right, I’ll apply it exactly to your PPTX and produce the Workbook v3 with the tabs and fields named above, so every “Spreadsheet Moment” on the slides opens to the right spot.\n\n09:05\nYou said:\nYeah, please update the pptx and don't make a new file, modify it - please apply all the changes and make sure the flow is clear and makes sense and the timing is good, we can also benefit from an over document with timing and outcomes for each section \nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 9m 27s\nAnalysis paused\n\nDone — I modified your existing PPTX in place (no new file created) and added an over‑document with timing & outcomes for each day.\n\nDownloads\n\nUpdated deck (BEIT theme, modified in place):\nOpen the PPTX(To Share).pptx)\n\nBackup (pre‑change):\nOpen the backup\n\nApplied‑changes log (what I changed, slide by slide):\nPPTX_Applied_Changes_Log.md\n\nTiming & Outcomes over‑document (5 days × 5 hours):\nPPTX_Overdoc_Timing_and_Outcomes.md\n\nWhat I changed right now (applied inside your PPTX)\n\nI made high‑impact updates that the trainers asked for, fixed Arabic phrasing, added the new inverted roof content, and wired the slides to the workbook cells you’ll use live. References below point to your current deck and interview notes.\n\n1) Arabic phrasing & opener fixes\n\nRenamed the Icebreaker slide title to كسر الحاجز (Icebreaker) and kept the toss activity. This directly addresses the translation issue Ghassan flagged.\n\n2) Money math (replace the flat 800 IQD rule)\n\nRewrote “Why Heat = Money” → “Tariff Reality — لا تستخدم 1 أمبير = 1 ك.و.س × 800 دينار”.\nBullets now instruct to use MoE/Ronaki tariff bands and a generator path, not a flat rate. I also added a small call‑out box pointing to the workbook cells you’ll drive in class:\nTariff_Calc → B3 (kWh), B4 (System), C14 (Total bill/IQD).\nThis implements the trainer correction in your interview/feedback.\n\n3) Second‑Floor comfort benchmark (new slide)\n\nInserted “اختبار الطابق الثاني — Second‑Floor Comfort Test” after the “Comfort & Cost Pressure” anchor. It sets a clear pass/fail: ΔT (ground vs. 2nd) ≤ 3 °C after fixes, with a note to capture IR/ΔT before/after — the same framing you and Omar discussed.\n\n4) Roof‑retrofit reality (new slides)\n\nInserted “Roof Retrofit Options (Flat RC)” right after Building Heat Gain Breakdown (Roof ≈ 70 / Walls ≈ 20 / Leaks ≈ 10).\nThe slide lists 5 practical paths for Mosul’s flat concrete roofs:\nCool‑roof coating ▸ Inverted roof (XPS above waterproofing) ▸ SPF + UV ▸ Ventilated canopy ▸ Interior drop ceiling — with checks for parapet height and drainage.\n\nInserted a dedicated slide “Inverted Roof (XPS) — الطبقات والفحوصات” covering layer order, height/drain, and an indicative ~15,000 IQD/m² for 50 mm XPS (tie‑back to supplier pricing in the workbook). This is the “inverted roof insulation” slide you asked for.\n\n5) Trust & quality\n\nInserted “قاعة العِبر — Hall of Shame (أخطاء يجب عدم تكرارها)” after the materials block:\n4,000‑unit disaster ▸ zift/bitumen melt ▸ reflective tile conflict ▸ red‑flag checklist. This is the cautionary, sales‑credibility content your trainers emphasized.\n\n6) Materials claims (footnote added)\n\nAdded a manufacturer‑data footnote to 6 slides in the Meet the Materials / Labkh / Mantofly block:\n\n“المعلومات المذكورة مأخوذة من نشرات المورد/المصنّع. الأداء الفعلي يعتمد على التحضير وجودة التطبيق والسُمك المُركّب — للتوجيه فقط وليست ضمانًا.”\nThis addresses the over‑claiming concern (e.g., “>1000 °C”, “60% savings”) in your deck.\n\n7) ETIS terminology (Arabic, bridges)\n\nUpdated the ETIS slide title to “ETIS: نظام العزل الحراري الخارجي” and added a note that continuous wrap reduces thermal bridges.\n\n8) SELL reframing (human‑first)\n\nInserted “الراحة قبل الكيلوواط — Comfort over Kilowatts (SELL)” near the Apply/Calculator segment (so the pitch follows proof). It includes the under‑promise line trainers asked for (10–12 °C), and the “what would this money fund?” hook to anchor real life outcomes.\n\n9) Practical roof safety\n\nOn Safety First, added a small box with 4:1 ladder rule, harness at edges, and hydrate every 20 min (practical cues over generic PPE).\n\nNote: I did not create a new file; the changes are inside your existing deck. A “pre‑change” backup is in the same folder in case you prefer to roll back.\n\nWhat’s included in the over‑document (timing & outcomes)\n\nYou asked for a simple, program‑level timing guide to keep sessions smooth over 5 hours/day for 5 days (Learn 90 min · Apply 150 min · Sell 60 min). I delivered a one‑pager per day with the outcomes you can check off.\n\nDay 1 — Understanding Heat & Trust (heat trends, 70/20/10, 2nd‑floor test, money math fix) → Outputs: Audit photos, ΔT sheet, tariff bill, 30‑sec pitch.\n\nDay 2 — Roofs & Materials (Retrofit First) (decision tree, above vs. below, inverted roof details, mixing lab) → Outputs: chosen roof option + spec checklist.\n\nDay 3 — Walls, Windows & BOQ (ETIS Arabic, WWR quick diagnosis, priority matrix) → Outputs: BOQ snapshot + ROI via Retrofit_Options.\n\nDay 4 — Planning, Objections & Quoting (objection flow, evidence pack) → Outputs: one ready Quote_Generator.\n\nDay 5 — Enterprise & Launch (trust systems, 30‑day launch plan) → Outputs: tracker KPIs + three scheduled audits.\nDownload the over‑doc.\n(Structure aligns with your deck & workbook cadence. )\n\nAlignment with your workbook (what the slide now points to)\n\nTariff live moment (Day‑1): slides reference Tariff_Calc → B3, B4, C14 so trainees see slabbed MoE/Ronaki billing on screen — replacing the flat 800 IQD myth the trainers flagged.\n\nRoof ROI (Day‑2): the Inverted roof slide text is written to map onto a Retrofit_Options row (U_before, U_after, cost/m², added height, drainage notes) that you asked us to keep in workbook—consistent with your supplier list and unit prices.\n\nQuote & SELL (Day‑4): the SELL slide references the Quote_Generator fields and the 30/70 terms with ΔT verification that came up in trainer notes.\n\nIf you’d like me to generate the updated v3 workbook with the sheets Tariff_Calc, Generator_Calc, Retrofit_Options, Quote_Generator, Supplier_Intel, and Project_Tracker pre‑wired, I can do that next. (The deck already references those names.)\n\nWhat remains (low‑risk cleanups I can do in a tiny second pass)\n\nTo keep the momentum, I focused first on the core content & flow (Arabic fixes, roof reality with inverted roof, comfort benchmark, money math, SELL). The following are already mapped and quick to finish next:\n\nMove the general “Explore More BEIT Trainings” QR slide to the end of Day 5 only (avoid early promo).\n\nTrim duplicates: extra “Heat Loss Zones” / “Energy & CO₂ Snapshot” repeats; keep one strong instance each.\n\nConvert “Meet the Materials” into the 5‑column local reality table and swap stock icons for site photos (I added the claims footnote now, photos next).\n\nWhy these changes match your interviews & files\n\nTrainers asked for kWh‑based tariff math and to remove “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh × 800 IQD” everywhere — done on the money slide with workbook hooks.\n\nTrainers asked to teach heat before materials, emphasize roof ≈ 70%, and set a simple success benchmark (2nd‑floor comfort) — new slides do that.\n\nYou asked for an inverted roof slide and a roof retrofit reality section — inserted beside the 70/20/10 slide.\n\nOver‑claims on materials were flagged — I inserted a manufacturer‑data footnote onto the Labkh/Mantofly slides now.\n\nQuick check on flow & timing (5‑hour day sample for Day‑1)\n\nLEARN (90): Heat trends → “Why Heat = Money” (tariff fix) → 70/20/10 → 2nd‑floor benchmark → movement of heat → trust case.\n\nAPPLY (150): Audit sprint (temps/leaks/amps) → Tariff_Calc live → prepare ΔT/IR photos.\n\nSELL (60): “Comfort over Kilowatts,” local stories, and one Quote_Generator page.\nThis matches your existing structure and keeps the pacing tight for 5 hours while locking to workbook evidence.\n\nIf you want me to finish the tidy‑up deletions, move the QR slide to Day‑5, and convert “Meet the Materials” into the 5‑column local table with your supplier prices and expiry checks, I can apply that next so the deck is fully cleaned and production‑ready. \n\nYou said:\nYes, make it production ready, don't make it only 3 hours long we need it to be 5 that's what we have. i have some ideas that we need to be sure to include the inverted roof section, that we need to discuss the idea of energy engineering or energy consulting as a new career possibility here and that mindset shifting is critical and to have moments for those discussions - also we need to open the idea potentially for new types of businesses and i had a thought that maybe we need some people to open up new import paths - maybe from turkey and the surrounding region for insulation methods not yet available here. we need to develop skills for inverted roof implementation that doesn't exist here yet which is the way you can do roofing with retrofits \nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 7m 11s\n\nAbsolutely—I’ve now made the deck production‑ready for 5‑hour days and added the new content you asked for (inverted roof implementation, energy‑consulting career track, mindset‑shift moments, and regional import pathways). I also delivered a v3 workbook wired to those slides so trainers can demo the math and the business path live.\n\n✅ What’s done (and where)\nA) Your PPTX (modified in place, BEIT theme)\n\nOpen the updated file\n👉 BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1-5 (BEIT Template)(To Share).pptx(To Share).pptx)\n(Backup of the original: link)\n\nKey upgrades now inside your deck:\n\n5‑hour pacing (not 3)\n\nUpdated the Daily Agenda slide to show LEARN 90 / APPLY 150 / SELL 60 and “Total: 5 hours per day”.\n— Keeps your Learn→Apply→Sell rhythm and matches your room booking.\n\nInverted roof (retrofits) — deep & practical\n\nRoof Retrofit Options (Flat RC) (new): Five real retrofit paths for concrete flat roofs, including the one you explicitly asked for.\n\nInverted Roof (XPS) — الطبقات والفحوصات (new): Layer stack, parapet/height checks, drainage extensions, acceptance tests, and an indicative ~15,000 IQD/m² for 50 mm XPS (tie‑back to workbook).\n\nInverted Roof Skills Studio (new): Roles, step‑by‑step method, QA acceptance criteria, and safety (harness, ladder 4:1, wind hold).\n→ These slides appear right after Building Heat Gain Breakdown so the “Roof ≈ 70%” message immediately flows into what to do.\n\nEnergy engineering / consulting as a career\n\nمسار مهني — الاستشارة والهندسة الطاقية (new):\nServices menu (audit → scope → procurement → supervision → evidence), pricing model (audit fee + material margin + 30/70 upon proof), and progression (L1 → L2 → Trainer/Lead).\n→ Inserted in the business/quote section to set a real career path participants can adopt next week.\n\nRegional import pathways (new business angle)\n\nمسارات الاستيراد الإقليمي — فرص أعمال جديدة (new):\nTurkey + surrounding region sourcing; CE/DoP/COA docs; MOQ/Incoterms; customs class; duty risk; counterfeit/expiry control; staged “sample → test → pilot” process.\n→ Encourages teams to open new import channels for high‑spec insulation systems not yet widely available in Mosul.\n\nMindset‑shift discussions (culture → career)\n\nلحظة تغيير الذهن — Mindset Shift (نقاش قصير) (new, Day‑1 to Day‑3 end‑of‑LEARN):\nFast prompts to move from “bigger A/C” thinking to “lower the load + measure ΔT”, link comfort to trust, and practice human‑first pitching.\n\nMoney math fixed (no more flat 800 IQD)\n\n“Why Heat = Money” was rewritten as Tariff Reality — لا تستخدم 1 أمبير = 1 ك.و.س × 800 دينار with a workbook call‑out to the Tariff_Calc sheet (drop‑downs and slabbed billing).\n→ Trainers now point to the spreadsheet rather than hand‑waving.\n\nTrust, materials & safety\n\nHall of Shame (new): 4,000‑unit disaster, zift/bitumen melt, reflective tile conflict (with red‑flag checklist).\n\nETIS slide title now Arabic (نظام العزل الحراري الخارجي) with a bridge‑kill note.\n\nManufacturer‑data footnote added to Labkh / Mantofly / materials slides to avoid over‑claims.\n\nSafety First enhanced with practical rooftop safety cues (harness, hydration, ladder rule).\n\nMaterials table for local reality\n\nالمواد في لمحة — Materials at a Glance (سوقنا المحلي) (new consolidated table):\nXPS, EPS, Mineral Wool, SPF, Thermal Plaster — best uses, indicative costs, red flags, and “Available in Mosul?” column.\n\nDe‑duplication & clean up\n\nTrimmed repeated Heat Loss Zones and Energy & CO₂ slides; moved Explore More BEIT QR to Day‑5 end only.\n\nKept your best‑performing learn/apply/sell content and welded it to the new workbook flows.\n\nA short change log with specifics is included here:\n👉 PPTX_Applied_Changes_Log.md\n\nB) Over‑document (trainer pacing & outcomes, 5 days × 5 hours)\n\nPPTX_Overdoc_Timing_and_Outcomes.md — one page per day with LEARN/APPLY/SELL timing, facilitation goals, and expected outputs.\n👉 Download\n\nC) Workbook v3 (aligned to the slides, ready to demo)\n\nOpen the Excel workbook\n👉 Mosul_Green_Architecture_Workbook_v3_RetrofitAligned.xlsx\n\nWhat’s inside (tabs & how slides use them):\n\nTariffs_2025 (data) — MoE & Ronaki slabs (Domestic & Commercial).\n\nTariff_Calc — Enter kWh and select System/Category → blended monthly bill with slab breakdown.\nSlides: Day‑1 “Tariff Reality” & SELL moments (cells referenced on‑slide).\n\nGenerator_Calc — 5A→30A table (Volts, hours/day) → kWh/month, MoE & Ronaki commercial billing via slabs.\nSlides: Day‑1 Apply and SELL proof.\n\nRetrofit_Options — Roof/walls measures with U_before/U_after, added‑height, indicative unit costs, life, and placeholders for Monthly_Savings.

            "extracted_content": "Absolutely—here’s a focused review of the training deck you shared, grounded in the Insulation Trainer’s Feedback document and cross‑checked against the current slides (txt + pdf). I’ve included a concise 3 pros / 5 cons and then a 10‑slide “fix & reorganize” mini‑deck you can build immediately.\n\n3 things that are already working (pros)\n\nClear daily rhythm (Learn → Apply → Sell). This through‑line shows up consistently and gives participants predictable outcomes each day. It’s a strong adult‑learning scaffold already visible in Day‑1 slides.\n\nHands‑on demos are front‑and‑center. Incense leak tests, IR camera/thermal‑bridge hunt, and conduction/convection/radiation demos make abstract concepts tangible and are called out in the deck.\n\nRight problem framing for Iraq. You emphasize that ~60–70% of summer heat enters via the envelope (walls/roof/windows), priming the audience to target insulation first—good behavioral cueing.\n\n5 priority gaps to fix (cons)\n\nTerminology & translation awkwardness in the opener. “Myth‑Busting/Breaking Legends” and similar phrasing were flagged by Ghassan; use simple, correct AR/EN for Icebreaker (“كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker”).\n\nCost/energy math oversimplified. Current slides imply “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh × 800 IQD” flat pricing; Ghassan noted tiered tariffs and generator realities make this inaccurate. Switch to a kWh‑based, tier‑band example with ranges.\n\nPerformance over‑claims on thermal plaster. Slides list “withstands > 1000 °C” and “achieves 60% energy savings” without caveats. Per feedback: present as manufacturer data with limits (prep, thickness, application quality).\n\nEnglish‑first, long blocks. Trainer notes ask for Arabic‑first slides/trainer notes and shorter ≤3‑hour blocks; current materials are mostly English with long day blocks.\n\nMissing market/implementation realism. You touch XPS/EPS vs others, but still need: supplier quality variability, expiry checks, on‑site pitfalls (corruption/shortcuts), and a brief “what to do if” activity.\n\n10‑slide “Fix & Reorganize” mini‑deck (ready to build)\n\nGoal: implement the feedback while streamlining Day 1 flow:\nWhy now → How heat moves → Where to act → Which materials → How to choose/price → Hands‑on → Sell.\nEach slide below lists Purpose → Content → What to change (from today) → Asset pointers.\n\nSlide 1 – Welcome & Icebreaker (AR‑first)\n\nPurpose: Start on the right cultural note; fix terminology.\n\nContent: Title “أهلاً بكم – كسر الحاجز (Icebreaker)”. One prompt: “اذكر أسوأ أسطورة سمعتها عن التبريد/العزل؟”\n\nChange: Replace “Myth‑Busting/Breaking Legends” with “كسر الحاجز”; keep it light & bilingual.\n\nAssets: Reuse existing myth list; scrub odd English phrasing.\n\nSlide 2 – Why Insulation in Iraq—Right Now (evidence first)\n\nPurpose: Anchor urgency with one number and one image.\n\nContent: “في الصيف، 60–70% من الحرارة تدخل عبر الجدران/الأسقف/النوافذ.” One heatwave photo; quick “raise your hand” poll.\n\nChange: Keep the 60–70% message; tighten narration to 60 seconds.\n\nAssets: Your current Day‑1 context slides already contain this.\n\nSlide 3 – How Heat Moves (3 modes before materials)\n\nPurpose: Apply the “teach heat first” sequence.\n\nContent: Conduction / Convection / Radiation + 1 demo each (rod/ice, incense, IR image).\n\nChange: Move this before the big materials table; keep demos on one tidy slide.\n\nAssets: Existing demo slide—consolidate and simplify.\n\nSlide 4 – Where to Attack First (heat‑gain map)\n\nPurpose: Translate modes into a target order.\n\nContent: Roof (largest), Walls, Windows/Air‑leaks. Add “thermal bridges” call‑out with IR example.\n\nChange: Strengthen the thermal‑bridge visual and caption.\n\nAssets: Your “Heat Loss/Heat Gain” and IR references—just add the bridge caption.\n\nSlide 5 – Materials at a Glance (with local reality)\n\nPurpose: Give the menu, not the meal.\n\nContent: 5 tiles: XPS / EPS / Mineral wool / PU (spray) / Thermal plaster (لبخ حراري–Mantofly). Under each: best‑for, watch‑outs.\n\nChange: Explicitly add thermal plaster and mark XPS/EPS popularity vs. quality variance.\n\nAssets: “Meet the Materials” + new thermal plaster tile and real on‑site photo.\n\nSlide 6 – Safety & Claims (footnote the promises)\n\nPurpose: Avoid over‑promising; standardize safety talk.\n\nContent: “Manufacturer claims: fire up to ~1000 °C, ~20 dB, energy savings—verify on site.” Add prep/thickness/application caveat.\n\nChange: Add a small footnote wherever benefits are listed for Labkh/Mantofly; don’t headline “60% savings” without context.\n\nAssets: Reuse current plaster slides; append footnote box.\n\nSlide 7 – Real Photos, Not Icons (trust builder)\n\nPurpose: Replace stock icons with on‑site images.\n\nContent: Before/after shots of thermal plaster application, plus 1 short clip. Prompt: “أين ستكون أكثر فاعلية في بيتنا النموذجي؟”\n\nChange: Swap icons for real jobsite media.\n\nAssets: Insert Ghassan’s photos/video when available. (Slide placeholder already exists.)\n\nSlide 8 – Honest Money Math (tiered kWh, 3 scenarios)\n\nPurpose: Fix the “amps × IQD” simplification.\n\nContent:\n\nFormula block: Savings (IQD) = kWh_saved × tariff_band_rate\n\nThree quick ranges: Low / Medium / High tariff bands; add generator case (fuel /L × kWh/L).\n\nNote: “Use local tariff bands; don’t present a single price.”\n\nChange: Replace or demote “Every 1 kWh = 800 IQD; 1 amp ≈ 1 kWh” framing; present ranges and assumptions.\n\nAssets: Keep your calculator moments, but update the math instruction and labels.\n\nSlide 9 – Supplier & Quality Reality (checklists)\n\nPurpose: Stop failures before they start.\n\nContent: 2 checklists (one for material quality/expiry/date & storage; one for site risks: shortcuts/corruption → what to do if…).\n\nChange: Add the explicit expiry‑date check, real‑world pitfalls, and a mini role‑play.\n\nAssets: Insert as a one‑pager in Day‑2/3 where procurement appears.\n\nSlide 10 – Field Workflow & “My Bait” hand‑off\n\nPurpose: Tie training to a repeatable field process + data tool.\n\nContent: “Day‑by‑day sprint” (Client Discovery → Suppliers → BOQ → Co‑Design) + a 3–4 h My Bait tutorial slot and deliverables checklist.\n\nChange: Make the app onboarding explicit (timeboxed), not ad‑hoc.\n\nAssets: Use the Mosul Green Architecture Workbook day tabs as your visual pipeline and deliverables.\n\nQuick mapping: what to tweak in the current file(s)\n\nRename & re‑script the opener: “Welcome & Icebreaker / كسر الحاجز” (Slide 5 in pdf → rename + script excerpt in AR/EN).\n\nMove “Heat Moves” earlier: Place before “Meet the Materials.” (Reorder Day‑1 sequence per feedback.)\n\nThermal plaster tile: Keep benefits but add footnote box (“supplier data; depends on prep/thickness/application”). (Slides 30–33).\n\nReplace stock icons: Use site photos for plaster/ETIS steps (Slides 34–35).\n\nFix money math slide: Swap the fixed “800 IQD/kWh” & “1 amp≈1 kWh” with 3‑scenario kWh‑band ranges; add generator fuel path. (Slide 6 & “Spreadsheet moment”).\n\nArabic‑first variants: Produce AR‑first trainer notes and short AR summaries on each slide; trim session blocks to ≤3 h where possible.\n\nAdd quality/expiry checklist: New one‑pager inserted in Day‑2/3 procurement flow.\n\nWhy these changes map cleanly to your own feedback file\n\nTerminology / opener — explicit instruction to avoid odd translations and use “Icebreaker / Break the barrier.”\n\nTeach heat before materials — endorsed lesson order.\n\nHeat‑loss emphasis — keep the 60–70% top‑line to motivate insulation first.\n\nThermal plaster — add as a named option with real photo; Ghassan will share media.\n\nReal images/video — replace stock icons to build trust.\n\nMarket reality (XPS/EPS) — acknowledge why they’re common; discuss quality tradeoffs.\n\nETIS — keep it as a method; ensure Arabic term clarity.\n\nPerformance & safety — footnote manufacturer claims.\n\nCost/energy math — move away from naive amps→IQD; use kWh and tiers.\n\nArabic‑first & shorter sessions — address language and block length.\n\nSupplier quality/expiry & “what to do if” — add the practical checklists/role‑play.\n\nMy Bait / workbook integration — allocate a dedicated slot and user guide.\n\n(Optional) Two micro‑scripts you can paste now\n\nFootnote template for material claims (paste into bottom of any “benefits” slide):\n“Data points shown are from supplier/manufacturer sheets. On‑site performance depends on surface preparation, application quality, and installed thickness. Use as directional guidance, not a guarantee.”\n\nHonest money math sidebar (replaces “1 amp = 1 kWh” line):\n“Estimate savings with kWh and tariff bands. Present low/medium/high cases. For generators, compute kWh from fuel burn (L/h) and runtime.”\n\nSources I relied on (from your project files)\n\nInsulation Trainer’s Feedback (priority items, statuses, and slide‑level notes).\n\nYour current Day‑1 slides (pdf + txt) for structure, demos, and current money‑math framing.\n\nWorkbook (“Mosul Green Architecture Workbook 2.0”) to wire the My‑Bait/field‑workflow hand‑off.\n\nGhassan x Bilal discussion (translation issues, amp‑math concerns, thermal plaster inclusion).\n\nIf you want, I can turn the 10‑slide mini‑deck above into a ready‑to‑deliver pptx with the AR/EN microcopy and footnotes baked in—just say the word and I’ll build it to match your template.\n\nYou said:\n i didn't know you can make a pptx can you make the full - maybe 30-50 slide pptx? - don't do it just yet just tell me how \nChatGPT said:\n\nHere’s how I can make that full 30–50-slide PowerPoint deck for you — step-by-step, so you know exactly what’s involved before I start generating it:\n\n🧩 1. Source Integration\n\nI’ll merge insights from four files you’ve shared:\n\nCurrent slides (txt + pdf) — base structure and visuals\n\nTrainer Feedback (PDF) — slide-level corrections and new content priorities\n\nGhassan × Bilal Discussion Notes — authentic phrasing and translation guidance\n\nWorkbook (Mosul Green Architecture) — field workflow and deliverables for later slides\n\nThis ensures the new deck stays true to your Insulation Project standards.\n\n🧠 2. Structure\n\nThe new 30–50 slides will be organized like this:\n\nBlock\tFocus\tSlide Count (est.)\n1. Welcome + Icebreaker\tHadith reflection, cultural framing, “Break the barrier” activity\t5–6 slides\n2. Why Insulation Matters\tIraq heat data, cost math (tiered kWh), environmental link\t6–7 slides\n3. How Heat Moves\tDemos + thermal bridge visuals\t5 slides\n4. Materials & Methods\tUpdated comparison + thermal plaster + ETIS\t8–10 slides\n5. Field Application\tHome-Audit Sprint, quality checklist, corruption “what-if”\t6–8 slides\n6.

Reflection & Next Steps\tMy Bait tutorial intro, Day-by-Day summary\t2–3 slides\n🛠️ 3. How I’ll Build It\n\nI’ll use the Day 1–5 BEIT Template as the base style and generate the deck directly in .pptx format with:\n\nbilingual AR/EN slide titles, per trainer feedback\n\nsimplified terminology (“كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker”)\n\nfixed cost/energy math using kWh tiers\n\nfootnotes for material performance claims\n\nreal-world visuals (placeholders where Ghassan’s photos are pending)\n\nworkbook-based practical sections (“My Bait”, “BOQ ROI”)\n\n📤 4. Output Options\n\nYou can choose one of two deliverables:\n\nSingle .pptx file — ready to project or edit.\n\n.pptx + Trainer Notes (docx) — includes facilitator scripts, timings, and cues (like your Day 1 notes).\n\n⚙️ 5. What I’ll Need from You Before Generating\n\nTo make sure I hit the right tone and level of detail:\n\nTarget size: Do you want closer to 30 slides (concise) or 50 slides (fully detailed facilitator version)?\n\nAudience: Engineers vs. Trainers vs. Public homeowners ?\n\nLanguage mix: Arabic first + English subtitles, or English first with Arabic notes?\n\nVisual assets: Do you want me to include placeholders for Ghassan’s photos/videos, or skip those until you upload them?\n\nOnce you confirm those four points, I can generate the full PowerPoint in about 2 passes:\n\nPass 1: Outline + slide text (content blocks, visuals, notes)\n\nPass 2: Render to .pptx with formatting, design, and bilingual labels.\n\nWould you like the 30-slide concise version or the 50-slide full trainer version?\n\nYou said:\nexecutive_summary.md\nFile\nfeedback_mapping.md\nFile\ndesigner_brief_one_page.md\nFile\nslide_by_slide_implementation_guide.md\nFile\nfull facilitator with the learn apply and sell leveraging this content and this pptx that you can work on which is in your project files BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1-5 (BEIT Template)(To Share).pptx\nI'm attaching a few files here for some other ideas, although I want you to think for yourself before updating the PPTX, we should first do this: can you think about the best way to give me an easy and fast way to update the slides with detailed descriptions of the slides to create, change and how to reordering we need from the slides so ew can apply the suggestions from the trainers best as extracted from the transcripts and the insight sheet? you can also include direct case studies and quote slides, i think that would be very insightful and culturally helpful - i don't think we can do things like wind towers, it's not really in our pervue - we want to work on insulation undersanding and especially upgrades on existing homes - not only new construction. - yeah, and i also included the architecture training pdf (English BG updated Architecture - Day 1-5 (BEIT Template)(To Share) (1).pdf) slides in the project files for you to extract helpful things .remember our goal is retrotfitting energy consulting businesses focused on insulation, not solar, not reconstructing houses and building interior gardens. although green walls can be a thing, we want to focus on retrofitting as much as we can and help people learn and assess and apply and see the business case for mosul - we don' tnee dto be \"culturally sensitive \"because we are iraqis in mosul doing the training, so we don't need to pretend - best to bring in the real examples from the call transcrips \nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 4m 45s\n\nPerfect—before we touch the PPTX, here’s a fast, designer‑ready change kit that tells you exactly what to create, what to edit, what to delete, and how to reorder to apply the trainers’ guidance. It’s lean enough to act on immediately, but specific enough that any editor can update the deck without guesswork.\n\n0) What this plan is based on (so you can trust it)\n\nYour current deck “BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1‑5 (BEIT Template)(To Share).pptx” (slide numbers below refer to this file).\n\nTrainer insights (Ghassan/Omar/Muthanna) distilled into slide‑level fixes.\n\nExecutive redesign notes (what to cut, what to add, and why).\n\nDesigner brief + implementation guide (ready‑to‑paste content for many slides).\n\nTranscripts & discussion to anchor real quotes/case studies in Mosul context.\n\nSupporting “Day‑1” text/pdf exports (to map exact slide positions and problematic lines like “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh”).\n\nScope confirmed: retrofit insulation for existing homes (no wind towers; no solar), with LEARN → APPLY → SELL rhythm and business case for Mosul.\n\nA) Reorder the training (3‑hour daily rhythm)\n\nWhy: Trainers say 5‑hour blocks exhaust participants; aim for ≤3 h/day with tangible daily outcomes.\n\nReplace “Daily Agenda” with this fixed pattern on each day’s agenda slide:\n\nLEARN (45 min) — 1 big idea + 1 short demo\n\nAPPLY (75 min) — 1 hands‑on sprint with a named deliverable\n\nSELL (45 min) — 1 micro‑pitch or proof (photo/IR/ΔT/worksheet) to close the loop\n\nPut this schedule into a new slide “3‑Hour Daily Rhythm” and use it every day (Day 1 slot: replace current agenda slide around #8). Microcopy + structure already drafted in the redesign files.\n\nB) Slides to create (10 new slides that do the most work)\n\nBelow are titles, where to insert, what to show, exact copy cues, and which trainer insight it implements. Where helpful, I’ve referenced the existing slide you should insert after.\n\n1) Insulation is a Basic Right (AR‑first)\n\nInsert after: Slide 2 (Hadith) → becomes slide 3.\n\nShow: Split image “before/after family” + bilingual headline\nArabic: في الموصل، نعتبر العزل رفاهية — لكن هذا خطأ\nEnglish: “In Mosul, we treat insulation as a luxury — but this is wrong.”\n\nScript prompt: “What would your family do with +100k IQD/month?”\n\nImplements: Cultural reframing; strengthens WHY.\n\n2) Trainer Voices: Why This Matters (quote boxes)\n\nInsert after: new slide 1 above → becomes slide 4.\n\nShow: 3 quotes (Ghassan/Omar/Yahia) with headshots. Keep quotes to ≤25 words each; include Omar’s second‑floor test line.\n\nImplements: Use local authority; frames comfort > kilowatts.\n\n3) Second‑Floor Comfort Test (benchmark)\n\nInsert after: Slide 21–22 “Heat Gain Breakdown” and before “Your Home as an Energy Envelope” (#24).\n\nShow: Thermal before/after mock with headline:\n“إذا قدرت تعيش بالطابق الثاني… فأنت وصلت المرحلة الممتازة”\n“If the 2nd floor is livable in August, you’ve reached excellent level.”\n\nAdd: “Why 2nd floor is the test” bullets + ΔT numbers.\n\nImplements: Success metric & honest expectations (10–12 °C).\n\n4) Hall of Shame: When Insulation Goes Wrong (3 caselets)\n\nInsert after: “Meet the Materials” block (Slides 28–35).\n\nShow:\n\n4,000‑unit new build with no roof insulation → retrofit 5× cost\n\nZift/old bitumen disaster → toxic melt & redo\n\nReflective tile mistake → heats neighbor, forced removal\n\nAdd: Red Flag Checklist (Never use… Always check…).\n\nImplements: “Teach failure modes” and stop shortcuts.\n\n5) Comfort Over Kilowatts (reframe the pitch)\n\nInsert: Day 1 SELL section (≈ Slide 47–49 zone).\n\nShow: Two columns OLD TECH PITCH vs NEW HUMAN PITCH (health, sleep, pride, productivity, money). Include “under‑promise: 10–12 °C” note.\n\nImplements: Sales psychology per trainers.\n\n6) Real Mosul Stories (testimonials slide)\n\nInsert: After comfort pitch above.\n\nShow: Short 2–3‑line stories (e.g., Um Youssef medical costs, Abu Hamza WFH).\n\nImplements: Local credibility & social proof.\n\n7) kWh Tariff Bands: Honest Money Math\n\nInsert: Replace/adjacent to current “Why Heat = Money” slide (#6).\n\nShow:\n\nSavings (IQD) = kWh_saved × tariff_band_rate\n\nLow/Med/High tariff examples + generator fuel path (kWh from L/h).\n\nKill “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh; 800 IQD flat” line.\n\nImplements: Fixes common error trainers flagged.\n\n8) Quality & Expiry Checklist (procurement reality)\n\nInsert: Day 2 Apply block (materials).\n\nShow: Expiry date, storage, supplier training, warranty, onsite QA.\n\nImplements: Market reality & anti‑corruption prevention.\n\n9) Mixing Lab (bucket‑mark ratios + 24 h curing)\n\nInsert: Day 2–3 Apply block.\n\nShow: Bucket mark photo, weight equivalence, “mason demo only,” curing time clock (24 h).\n\nImplements: Practical accuracy & safety.\n\n10) Install‑First, Pay‑Later (trust‑building model)\n\nInsert: Day 5 Business section.\n\nShow: 30% materials + 70% after ΔT verification; phased roof→walls→sealing; “What‑if” corruption scenarios with scripts.\n\nImplements: Real‑world business model.\n\nC) Slides to modify (surgical edits with copy you can paste)\n\nThese are the fastest high‑impact fixes in your current Day‑1 slides.\n\nOpening / Icebreaker terminology\n\nSlide 5 title currently “Breaking the barrier of traditional construction.” Replace the earlier “Myth‑Buster/Legends” terminology everywhere with: “كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker”. Keep the toss activity, but rename it: “Myth Toss / رمي الأساطير” and simplify the myths list.\n\nWhy Heat = Money (Slide 6)\n\nRemove: “Every 1 kWh costs 800 IQD” and “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh for 1 hour.”\n\nReplace with the Tariff Bands slide spec in B‑7 above. Trainers asked for ranges & generator reality.\n\nBuilding Heat Gain Breakdown (Slide 22)\n\nKeep Roof 70% / Walls 20% / Leaks 10% but add a footnote:\n“Based on typical Mosul homes (concrete roof, hollow block walls, single‑pane windows). Your house may vary.”\n\nAdd Retrofit Priority Matrix below: Phase 1: Air sealing → Phase 2: Roof → Phase 3: Walls.\n\nMeet the Materials (Slides 28–32)\n\nConvert to a 5‑column table: Material / Best Use / Typical Cost / Red Flags / Available in Mosul?\n\nThermal plaster (Labkh/Mantofly): keep benefits but add a small footnote on every benefits slide:\n“Supplier/manufacturer data; performance depends on prep, thickness, application quality.” (this replaces over‑claims like “> 1000 °C” and “60% savings” as standalone promises).\n\nETIS term check (Slide 34)\n\nEnsure Arabic label is consistent “ETIS: نظام العزل الحراري الخارجي” and clarify “continuous wrap to kill thermal bridges.”\n\nYour Home as an Energy Envelope (Slide 24)\n\nKeep, but add humidity target box (40–60% RH) and explicitly tie to reduced AC runtime—your text draft already hints this; make it explicit.\n\nSafety First (Slide 37)\n\nKeep ladder rule/hydration; add “roof work without harness is common—use 4:1 ladder rule + spotter” (practical over theoretical PPE).\n\nSpreadsheet moments (Slides 43, 48)\n\nAbove the calculator tables, add “What could this money fund?” (school fees, medicine). This connects to SELL framing.\n\nD) Slides to delete or move (to hit the 3‑hour rhythm)\n\nCut any U‑value deep dives beyond the 5 you need (your Day‑1 already has a clean table—keep that; trim any repeats across days).\n\nMove line‑by‑line BOQ examples to a handout; keep only a single BOQ template slide in deck.\n\nConsolidate repetitive business theory into 3 slides max (include Install‑First/Pay‑Later + phased offers + objections flow).\n\nMove QR promo slides to end of Day‑5 only.\nThese cuts match the executive targets (192 → ~120 slides total; 3‑hour days).\n\nE) Quote & case‑study slides you can paste in\n\nTwo “ready” slides that use real trainer lines; keep each quote ≤25 words.\n\nSlide: Trainer Voices (Omar)\n\n“If you can make the second floor comfortable, you’ve reached excellent level.” — Omar Laith\n\nSlide: Trust Warning (Ghassan)\n\n“One bad job ruins 10 referrals—invest once, save long‑term.” — Ghassan (also echoed on Day‑1 slide 23)\n\nSlide: Zift Hall‑of‑Shame (caselet)\n\n“Old bitumen melted at ~50 °C; family paid twice to redo.” (Use warning icon + 2 bullet “real cost”.)\n\nSlide: 4,000‑Unit Disaster (caselet)\n\n“Zero roof insulation → 5× retrofit cost; property values ↓30%.” (Make it visual—before/after roof section.)\n\nSlide: Reflective Tile Mistake (caselet)\n\n“Shiny roof tiles cooked the neighbor’s windows—forced removal.” (Add “Reflection ≠ Reduction” note.)\n\nF) Find‑and‑Replace & micro‑copy fixes (15‑minute pass)\n\nMyth terms: replace “Myth‑Busting/Breaking Legends” with “كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker” everywhere.\n\nMoney math: purge “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh; 800 IQD flat” and any single‑price statements; replace with “Tariff bands + generator path.”\n\nThermal plaster claims: add small footnote under benefits (“supplier data; performance depends on prep/thickness/application”).\n\nArabic‑first: for every section title, add Arabic title first and keep concise English subtitle in smaller type.\n\nETIS term: unify Arabic naming; mention “continuous wrap” to kill bridges.\n\nG) Day‑by‑Day LEARN / APPLY / SELL micro‑blueprints (retrofit‑only)\n\nKeep these as section cover notes for each day—one slide each.\n\nDay 1 – Understanding Heat & Trust\n\nLEARN: Iraq heat trend; 3 modes; heat‑gain map; 2nd‑floor test.\n\nAPPLY: Home‑Audit Sprint (temps, leaks, generator amps).\n\nSELL: Comfort‑first pitch + tariff‑band savings; record 30‑sec hook.\n\nDay 2 – Roofs & Materials (retrofit focus)\n\nLEARN: XPS/EPS/mineral wool/PU + thermal plaster incl. red flags.\n\nAPPLY: Mixing Lab + Quality & Expiry checks; mini‑tile ΔT tests.\n\nSELL: “Cheap‑now = pay‑later” with live ΔT and ROI.\n\nDay 3 – Walls, Windows & BOQ (retrofit)\n\nLEARN: ETIS basics; WWR limits; sealing priority.\n\nAPPLY: BOQ template only + supplier quotes; no line‑item rabbit holes.\n\nSELL: Three options (GOOD/BETTER/BEST) with phaseable caps.\n\nDay 4 – Retrofit Planning & Quoting\n\nLEARN: Priority matrix (air‑sealing → roof → walls); objections map.\n\nAPPLY: Quote Generator; evidence pack (IR + ΔT + photos).\n\nSELL: Pilot proposal with Install‑First, Pay‑Later draft terms.\n\nDay 5 – Enterprise & Launch\n\nLEARN: “What‑if” corruption scenarios; trust systems.\n\nAPPLY: 30‑day launch plan (weekly milestones + WhatsApp check‑ins).\n\nSELL: Final pitch; commit to 3 pilot homes.\n\nH) Exactly where to click/change in your current deck (fast map)\n\nSlide 2 (Hadith) → keep; add one‑line bridge “اليوم… سنكون أنفع للناس عبر…” (Today we’ll be “of benefit” by…).\n\nSlide 3/4 (Explore trainings) → move to Day‑5 end.\n\nSlide 5 (Icebreaker) → rename “كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker”; keep toss activity.\n\nSlide 6 (Why Heat = Money) → replace with Tariff Bands version (B‑7).\n\nSlides 12–16 (Context) → keep 1–2 strong visuals; trim any duplicates.\n\nSlide 22 (Heat Gain Breakdown) → add footnote + Priority Matrix.\n\nSlides 28–32 (Meet the Materials) → convert to 5‑column table + footnote under Mantofly/thermal plaster benefits; insert Hall of Shame right after.\n\nSlide 34 (ETIS) → keep; fix term; add “continuous wrap” note.\n\nSlide 37 (Safety) → keep; add 4:1 ladder + hydration callouts (already present; just make explicit).\n\nSlides 43, 48–49 (Calculator + pitch) → add “What could this money fund?” prompt; add Comfort Over Kilowatts + Mosul stories as new slides after 47.\n\nI) Asset checklist (so production isn’t blocked)\n\nPhotos:\n\nFamily before/after (can stage quickly on site).\n\nThermal plaster on‑site application (Ghassan media when available; placeholder until then).\n\nIcons: Warning triangle / fire / sun reflect (Hall of Shame).\n\nTables:\n\nMaterials 5‑column table template.\n\nTariff bands table (3 scenarios + generator path).\n\nWorksheets: BOQ template (single slide + downloadable sheet).\n\nJ) One‑page task list (hand this to your editor)\n\nReorder agenda on each day to 3‑hour rhythm; paste the rhythm slide.\n\nInsert 10 new slides exactly where noted (B‑section).\n\nModify 8 slides (C‑section) incl. money math, materials footnotes, ETIS Arabic term.\n\nDelete/move QR promos, deep U‑value repeats, line‑by‑line BOQ, generic business theory (leave template + 3 targeted business slides).\n\nAdd quotes & caselets (E‑section) with ≤25‑word quotes.\n\nRun the 15‑minute Find‑&‑Replace pass (F‑section).\n\nWant me to turn this spec into the actual .pptx next?\n\nIf you say “go,” I’ll implement this exact change kit directly into BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1‑5 (BEIT Template)(To Share).pptx—keeping your template, Arabic‑first titling, and the LEARN/APPLY/SELL rhythm throughout.\n\nYou said:\ngo\nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 7m 0s\n\n✅ Done. I’ve generated the full facilitator PPTX (44 slides) with the LEARN → APPLY → SELL rhythm, grounded in your trainer insights and the current deck’s structure.\n\nDownload the PowerPoint:\nInsulation_Retrofit_Training_Facilitator_2025-10-11.pptx\n\nWhat’s inside (at a glance)\n\nStructure (44 slides):\n\nDay 1 — Understanding Heat & Trust: WHY insulation, heat‑gain map, Second‑Floor Comfort Test, demos, materials (with footnotes), Hall‑of‑Shame, safety.\n\nDay 1 APPLY: Home‑Audit Sprint (temps, leaks, generator).\n\nDay 1 SELL: Comfort‑over‑kilowatts, Mosul stories, 30‑sec hooks.\n\nDay 2 — Roofs & Materials (Retrofit): Mixing Lab (bucket marks), Quality & Expiry checklist, ΔT roof‑tile lab, SELL: cheap‑now = pay‑later.\n\nDay 3 — Walls, Windows & BOQ: ETIS & WWR (retrofit‑fit), Retrofit Priority Matrix (Sealing → Roof → Walls), BOQ template & quotes, GOOD/BETTER/BEST options.\n\nDay 4 — Planning & Quoting: Objections flow, evidence pack, SELL: pilot proposal.\n\nDay 5 — Enterprise & Launch: Install‑First/Pay‑Later, “What‑if” corruption scenarios, 30‑day launch plan, WhatsApp accountability, Reflection, QR promo is only at the very end.\n\nFacilitator notes are embedded on key slides (purpose, script beats, activity, materials) so trainers can run sessions without a separate workbook.\n\nWhat I changed from your current deck (mapped to trainer feedback)\n\nNew rhythm slide (3 hours/day: 45‑75‑45) replaces long blocks to avoid fatigue.\n\n“Insulation is a Basic Right” (AR‑first) + Trainer Voices slides set the tone and use real quotes.\n\nSecond‑Floor Comfort Test establishes a success benchmark trainees can sell.\n\nHonest money math replaces the “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh; 800 IQD flat” framing with a Tariff‑Bands table and generator path. (Slide in deck titled: “Honest Money Math — kWh Tariff Bands (Replace '1 amp = 1 kWh × 800 IQD')”).\n\nMaterials are kept practical (XPS/EPS, mineral wool, PU, thermal plaster) with red‑flag warnings and footnotes (“supplier data; depends on prep, thickness, application”).\n\nHall of Shame slide teaches failure modes (4,000‑unit disaster, zift/bitumen melt, reflective tile mistake) and introduces a red‑flag checklist.\n\nQuality & Expiry checklist and Mixing Lab bring in the practical controls trainers asked for (bucket‑mark ratios, 24‑hour curing).\n\nRetrofit Priority Matrix (Sealing → Roof → Walls) added under the heat‑gain framing you already have.\n\nSELL reframing: Comfort over kilowatts + real Mosul stories + 30‑sec hook.\n\nBusiness model slides: Install‑First/Pay‑Later + “What‑if” corruption scenarios + 30‑day launch plan + WhatsApp accountability.\n\nSlide crosswalk (where to find the big things)\n\n3‑Hour Daily Rhythm: Slide 2 (use at start of each day).\n\nInsulation is a Basic Right: Day 1.\n\nTrainer Voices: Day 1 (quotes from Ghassan/Omar).\n\nSecond‑Floor Comfort Test: Day 1.\n\nHall of Shame (three caselets + red‑flags): Day 1, after Materials.\n\nTariff Bands (kWh) money math (replaces the flat 800 IQD line): Day 1 SELL prep.\n\nMixing Lab & Quality/Expiry: Day 2.\n\nRetrofit Priority Matrix & BOQ template: Day 3.\n\nObjection handling, Evidence pack, Pilot proposal: Day 4.\n\nInstall‑First/Pay‑Later, What‑if corruption, 30‑day launch: Day 5.\n\nHow this aligns with your files (for traceability)\n\nExecutive Summary → guided the cuts (60+), rhythm, and 10 priority slides.\n\nTrainer Feedback → Slide Solutions Mapping → ensured each high‑priority concern is addressed (luxury myth, zift warning, 4,000‑unit case, comfort benchmark, business model).\n\nDesigner Brief (one‑pager) → determined immediate “Phase 1” slides to create and “Phase 2” refinements.\n\nSlide‑by‑Slide Implementation Guide → provided copy and placements for new/modified slides (esp. Day 1 & Day 5).\n\nCurrent Day‑1 deck text/pdf → I replicated the strong parts (demos, audit sprint, SELL prompts) with fixes instead of rewriting from scratch.\n\nNotes & placeholders (so you can slot media in fast)\n\nPhotos/video: Hall‑of‑Shame, thermal plaster application, and roof‑tile ΔT lab have media placeholders on the slides; drop in Ghassan’s photos when available.\n\nTariff Bands: The table explicitly directs trainers to insert actual local band rates or generator fuel conversions pre‑session; it removes the “800 IQD flat” error.\n\nArabic‑first: Many section titles are bilingual; keep the Arabic title first as requested in trainer comments.\n\nWant a version that reuses your visual theme?\n\nThis file uses a neutral theme. If you’d like, I can output a second version using your BEIT template styles (colors, fonts, cover layout), keeping the same slide content and notes. Just drop the template .potx or .pptx theme here and I’ll regenerate with it.\n\nIf anything in the deck should be added/removed for this cohort (e.g., an extra roof‑only case study), tell me and I’ll update the slides immediately. \n\nYou said:\ngo, use the theme from the pptx that you have already \n\nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 4m 17s\n\nAll set — I’ve rebuilt the facilitator deck using your BEIT template theme from the original PPTX.\n\nDownload (BEIT theme applied):\nInsulation_Retrofit_Training_Facilitator_BEIT_Theme_2025-10-11.pptx\n\nI located the template at BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1-5 (BEIT Template)(To Share).pptx and used it as the base, so layouts, fonts, and colors now match your house style. The content and sequencing follow the redesign plan we agreed (LEARN → APPLY → SELL), and the changes implement the trainer feedback and action plan.\n\nWhat changed relative to your current deck (traceable to your documents)\n\nPacing & structure: The 3‑hour daily rhythm replaces long blocks; every day ends with a concrete SELL deliverable.\n\nFraming slides: Added “Insulation is a Basic Right” and “Trainer Voices” to set local, retrofit‑focused context.\n\nBenchmark: Second‑Floor Comfort Test slide gives a pass/fail goal trainees can sell.\n\nMoney math fix: Replaced the flat “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh; 800 IQD” with Tariff‑Band math and generator fuel path. (You can drop in local rates pre‑session.)\n\nMaterials realism: Kept XPS/EPS/Mineral Wool/PU/thermal plaster; added red‑flag warnings and footnotes on claims.\n\nFailure mode education: Hall of Shame (4,000‑unit disaster, zift meltdown, reflective tile mistake) + red‑flag checklist.\n\nQuality control: Mixing Lab (bucket‑mark ratios, 24 h curing) + Quality & Expiry checklist.\n\nRetrofit priority: Sealing → Roof → Walls matrix; ETIS clarified as external wrap (bridges reduction).\n\nBusiness model: Install‑First/Pay‑Later, objection handling, evidence packs, 30‑day launch plan, WhatsApp accountability.\n\nQuick notes for trainers\n\nDrop‑in media: Several slides have placeholders for Ghassan’s on‑site photos (thermal plaster application, coating failure, tile lab). Replace placeholders with real images when available.\n\nTariff table: Before each cohort, enter current kWh band rates (and generator conversion) in the “Honest Money Math” table; the deck intentionally avoids a single flat IQD figure.\n\nArabic‑first: Section titles are bilingual with Arabic first, per trainer guidance.\n\nIf you want micro‑tweaks (e.g., slotting a specific supplier name set from Mosul, or swapping in your preferred Arabic phrasing on 2–3 headers), tell me the lines to change and I’ll update the BEIT‑themed deck right away. \n\nYou said:\nok, now let's review the workbook nad update it to align with these slides and make a new xlsx - you can check the work book we uploaded in the project docs - the tariff table is here attached \nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 10m 50s\n\nDone—here’s a clean, tariff‑aware workbook that matches your slides and the BEIT “Learn → Apply → Sell” flow, using the same yellow/green theme:\n\n👉 Download the Excel: BEIT_Insulation_Tariff_Calculator_v2.xlsx\n\nWhat I built (and why)\n\n1) Tariff engine with slabs (MOE vs KRG/Ronaki).\n\nMOE–Domestic: 10 IQD (0–1500 kWh), 35 (1501–3000), 80 (3001–4000), 120 (>4000).\n\nMOE–Commercial: 60 (0–1000), 80 (1001–2000), 120 (>2000).\n\nOther MOE categories: Government 120; Industrial 60; Agricultural 60 (flat).\n\nKRG/Ronaki–Domestic: 72 (0–400), 108 (401–800), 175 (801–1200), 265 (1201–1600), 350 (>1600).\n\nKRG/Ronaki–Commercial 185 (flat); Government 160; Industrial 160 (and “Industrial‑Large” 125); Agricultural 60.\nThis directly reflects the images you shared so the workbook reproduces your slide math instead of using a naïve “amps × price” shortcut (Ghassan’s request) and ties cost to kWh using tiered slabs.\n\n2) Generator reality: Amps → kWh → monthly bills.\nA “Generator_Calc” sheet converts amps to kWh (default 220 V, 24 h/day, 30 days), then prices each scenario under MOE and KRG for the Commercial category—the same comparison table in your slide. The 5A→30A rows match your posted figures (differences ≤ 250 IQD are rounding). This fits Day 1’s “Generator Reality Calculator / Savings Math” and makes your cost examples defensible.\n\n3) Drop‑in to your BEIT pipeline.\nThe workbook mirrors your existing structure (Customer Intake → Energy Calculator → Quote Generator → Project Tracker), so you can paste a client’s monthly kWh and immediately show “MOE vs KRG” bills and the delta in your Quote.\n\n4) Visuals/theme.\nSheets use the same yellow/green accenting as your training deck for faster recognition in class.\n\nWhat’s inside (sheet‑by‑sheet)\n\nTariffs\nAll slab bands with IQD/kWh rates for MOE and KRG (Ronaki), by category. Editable if tariffs change.\n\nCalculator\n\nInputs: Region/System, Category, kWh/month.\n\nOutputs: total bill and average rate, plus an auto “Slab Breakdown” so trainees see exactly how each band contributes (great for the Sell block when you justify quotes). Aligns with your Day 1 “Heat → Bills → Insulation First” framing.\n\nGenerator_Calc\n\nInputs: Volts, hours/day, days/month; Region/Category for billing.\n\nPre‑filled 5/10/15/20/25/30 A table → kWh → MOE bill → KRG bill → KRG/MOE ratio.\n\n5 A: 792 kWh → MOE ≈ 47,520 IQD; KRG = 146,520 IQD.\n\n10 A: 1,584 kWh → MOE ≈ 106,720 IQD; KRG = 293,040 IQD.\n(Your slide shows 47,500 / 106,750; the tiny differences are rounding.)\nThis makes the “Why Heat = Money” moment accurate without oversimplifying—the exact fix Ghassan asked for.\n\nDashboard\nQuick side‑by‑side for 5–30 A at 24/7 service (the default assumption in the image), handy for live facilitation.\n\nNotes & Assumptions\nSources (your two images), slab definitions, and a reminder that real bills may include fixed fees/taxes and less than 24/7 supply—so trainers can dial down Hours/Day to local reality.\n\nHow to use it in class (fast)\n\nLearn. Show “Calculator” with a simple 2,000 kWh/month example and click through the slab breakdown. Reinforces Heat → AC hours → Bills → Insulation First.\n\nApply. Switch to “Generator_Calc,” set Hours/Day to what the neighborhood actually gets (e.g., 12–18 h), and price 5A/10A… to produce local bills that match participants’ experience. No “amps × price” shortcuts.\n\nSell. Use the delta between MOE and KRG (or between before/after kWh) to build the Pain‑to‑Price story in your Quote Generator and Day 1 sell cards—“Invest once, not twice.”\n\nHow to merge this into your master BEIT workbook\n\nYour current workbook already routes Customer Intake → Energy Calculator → Quote Generator → Project Tracker. Add these connections:\n\nCopy the sheets “Tariffs”, “Calculator”, “Generator_Calc”, “Notes & Assumptions” into the main file.\n\nIn Energy Calculator, add three yellow input cells:\n\nTariff_System (drop‑down: MOE (Federal) / KRG (Ronaki))\n\nTariff_Category (drop‑down: Domestic/Commercial/…)\n\nMonthly_kWh (from your audit/app or meter)\n\nLink your Quote:\n\nMonthly Bill (IQD) → =Calculator!C7\n\nAvg Rate (IQD/kWh) → =Calculator!C8\n\nMonthly Savings → Before − After (or MOE − KRG, depending on scenario).\n\nIn Project Tracker, store the chosen tariff context (so follow‑ups keep the same assumptions).\n\nIf you prefer a single‑cell Excel formula for slabs, you can also compute per‑band kWh as\nMAX(0,MIN(kWh,Upper)−Lower) for each row in Tariffs, multiply by its Rate, and SUMPRODUCT—but the included “Calculator” sheet already shows this breakdown transparently.\n\nWhy this matches the trainers’ guidance\n\nOrder + emphasis. We model cost properly after teaching heat movement and where gains come from (60–70% via walls/roof/windows), then connect to ROI and quotes.\n\nNo over‑promising. Numbers are plainly parameterized (hours/day, days/month, category) and annotated with limits.\n\nPipeline‑ready.

Here’s a tight plan that 1) settles the “roof‑first?” question with what’s actually doable on Mosul’s flat concrete roofs, 2) reorders the deck so it tracks your calculator and the Architecture insights, and 3) specifies exactly what to add/change on each slide (using the same theme as your PPTX).\n\n1) Should we focus on the roof first? And can we retrofit flat concrete roofs?\n\nShort answer: Yes—start with the roof when access and height allow, and you do not need to break the slab. Several retrofit paths fit Mosul’s flat RC roofs.\n\nWhy roof-first: Your current deck already frames the roof as the largest single heat path (Roof ≈ 70%, Walls ≈ 20%, Air leaks ≈ 10%) with indicative costs and ROI, which is the right starting hypothesis to test per site.\n\nWhat interviews & trainer notes say:\n\nTeach how heat moves before talking materials; keep the roof/walls/windows emphasis (~60–70% of summer heat via the envelope) to motivate insulation.\n\nUse real materials/jobs (e.g., Labkh/Mantofly thermal plaster) and ETIS as concrete options; avoid over‑promising, show limits and use‑cases.\n\nAvoid naïve “amps × IQD” math; Iraq tariffs are tiered—use kWh‑based or tariff‑table methods in the calculator.\n\nOn‑the‑ground options for flat RC roofs (no slab demolition):\n\nCool‑roof coating (white/reflective)\nPros: lowest cost/skill; quick comfort gains.\nCons: durability varies; must specify UV‑stable, correct prep; your “Ghassan’s coating failure” slide is the cautionary tale—cheap coatings peel and kill trust.\n\nInverted roof (XPS above waterproofing) with pavers/screed\nPros: proven on flat RC roofs; continuous insulation; serviceable; no interior disruption.\nNotes: check added height vs thresholds/parapets; ensure drainage. Your material price points already list XPS 50 mm ≈ 15,000 IQD/m², matching the deck’s “typical fix cost” order‑of‑magnitude.\n\nSpray polyurethane foam (SPF) + UV topcoat\nPros: insulation + air/water sealing in one; conforms around penetrations.\nNotes: needs trained crew; add UV‑stable coat (quality/spec matter—tie to the failure slide).\n\nVentilated over‑roof / shade canopy\nPros: strong radiative + convective cut; no wet work; good when parapet height is tight.\nNotes: treat as “double roof”; include wind bracing; works well over occupied homes.\n\nInterior drop‑ceiling with mineral wool / boards (when exterior access is impossible)\nPros: avoids roof height issues.\nNotes: handle vapor control to prevent condensation; doesn’t stop solar heating of slab, but reduces downward heat to rooms.\n\nBottom line: If you can add height and reach the roof, go Roof first (Inverted roof or SPF). If not, do Air‑sealing + west/east wall upgrades + shading first, and use cool‑roof as the quick win with a strong durability spec to avoid repeat work. Your Architecture deck also puts “Roofs & Realistic Wins” early (Day 3), which we’ll mirror in the insulation deck flow.\n\n2) Re‑ordering the training so it aligns to the calculator and Architecture insights\n\nWe’ll keep your Learn→Apply→Sell rhythm but expand to a full‑day (or two‑day) delivery with ~40–50 slides. The re‑order leverages what you already have and what the trainers asked for.\n\nNew macro‑flow (what participants do, and when)\n\nFrame & Facts\n\nWhy insulation now (heat & cost pressures), then how heat moves.\n\nPull forward your envelope/heat‑modes content and fix translations per trainer note.\n\nDecide where to start (Roof‑first Decision Tree)\n\nAdd a 1‑slide decision tree (access? height? leakage? budget?) to select roof vs wall vs air‑sealing first step.\n\nMaterials with market reality\n\nKeep core materials (XPS/EPS/PU/mineral wool) plus Labkh/Mantofly and ETIS, with real job photos.\n\nCalculator‑driven scoping\n\nApply Audit → Calculator → BOQ → Quote pipeline already in your deck, but hook it to tiered tariffs and a roof option set (see Section 3).\n\nSell with trust\n\nKeep “Invest once, not twice” and the coating‑failure case; add two short quotes from the Ghassan call on translation clarity and cost math caution.\n\nCase‑study & objection handling\n\nShow one roof retrofit micro‑case (before/after temps; cost; payback), and a wall + air‑seal micro‑case for homes where roof height is constrained.\n\n3) Slide‑by‑slide “update manifest” (use the same theme)\n\nBelow, “[NEW]” means create a new slide. All other entries reference slides in BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1‑5 (BEIT Template).\n\nOpen & framing\n\nS5 “Breaking the barrier…” → Rename to “Welcome & Icebreaker (Break the barrier)”; fix translation per trainer note. Add 1 sub‑bullet: “Say your name + 1 heat myth you’ve heard.”\n\nS6 “Why Heat = Money” → Keep, but add a footer: “We’ll use tariff tables in the calculator—no flat ‘amps × IQD’.”\n\nFacts first\n\nS12–S16 (Why insulation / Rising temps / Energy & CO₂) → Keep sequence; ensure the 60–70% envelope line is spoken, not over‑promised.\n\nS21 “Building Heat Gain Breakdown” → Keep the Roof 70 / Walls 20 / Air 10 graphic. Add a right‑hand “Check before roof‑first” list: access? height margin? active leaks? tenant constraints? (This primes the new decision tree.)\n\n[NEW] Roof‑first Decision Tree (insert after S21)\n\n1 slide, four questions → leads to A) Inverted Roof, B) SPF, C) Cool‑roof + air‑seal, D) Walls + air‑seal first. Include a tiny note: “If parapet < 20 cm spare height → avoid inverted roof; pick SPF or ventilated shade.”\n\nFooter: “We’ll size this in the calculator using U‑value deltas and tiered tariffs.”\n\nMaterials (with market reality)\n\nS26 “Heat Transfer & Insulation Comparison” → Add “Insulated panel (retrofits & new roofs)” is valid for roofs—call this out explicitly to counter the “can’t retrofit roofs” myth.\n\nS28–S35 “Meet the Materials / Labkh / ETIS / On‑site application”\n\nAdd a “Market Reality” call‑out: “EPS/XPS are widely used locally (cost/ease); compare with PU/mineral wool/thermal plaster for fire, moisture, and durability.”\n\nAdd footnote on Labkh/Mantofly claims as manufacturer data; verify per job (trainer caution).\n\n[NEW] Roof Retrofit Options (insert after S35)\n\nSlide A: “5 Ways to Retrofit a Flat RC Roof” — bullet each option (Cool‑roof, Inverted roof (XPS), SPF+topcoat, Ventilated over‑roof, Interior drop‑ceiling).\n\nSlide B: “Spec the Roof Right (Durability First)” — checklist: surface prep, primer, UV topcoat, drainage, penetration detailing, mock‑up & pull‑test; link visually to your coating‑failure case.\n\nSlide C: “Height & Waterproofing Checks” — simple sketch: slab → waterproofing → XPS → geotextile → paver/screed; red flags: low parapet, door thresholds, poor slope (ponding).\n\nCalculator‑driven scoping\n\nS38–S44 (Home‑Audit & Pipeline) → Keep, but:\n\nS39–S42 add a right column “Map to Calculator cells” (Room temps → ΔT; Air‑leaks → sealing scope; Generator amps photo → baseline proof).\n\nS43 “Cost & Savings Snapshot” → Replace “Potential Savings” description with “uses tiered tariffs; select MoE vs Ronaki in a dropdown” (see workbook edits below).\n\nSell with trust\n\nS23 “Ghassan’s Coating Failure” → Keep; add one 10‑word quote from the call (e.g., “Cheap coating peeled in days; customer paid twice.”) to anchor the trust message.\n\nS47–S49 (Sell) → Keep the “Invest once” story; add a one‑line disclaimer “Savings shown use the selected tariff table and U‑value deltas.”\n\nArchitecture sync (to reinforce “retrofit wins”)\n\n[NEW] 1 slide: “Our Architecture Track puts Roofs & Realistic Wins early—same here: we test the roof first, then walls & windows if site constraints block roof work.”\n\n4) Workbook & Calculator edits (so slides and numbers match)\n\nUse your Mosul_Green_Architecture_Workbook_2.0 as the base and add these sheets/fields so the deck can say “Open to cell X” and the math is defensible.\n\nTariff tables (NEW hidden sheets):\n\nTariff_IQ_MoE (national Ministry of Electricity tiers).\n\nTariff_KRI_Ronaki (Kurdistan/Ronaki tiers).\n\nAdd Selector cell (drop‑down): Tariff_Source = {\"MoE\", \"Ronaki\"}; billing formula looks up the right table by kWh block and amp subscription where applicable. (This replaces any flat “800 IQD/kWh” shortcuts flagged by trainers.)\n\nRoof options table (NEW):\n\nColumns: Option | Added Height (mm) | U_before | U_after | ΔU | SRI_before | SRI_after | Moisture/Leak Fix? (Y/N) | Unit Cost IQD/m² | Life (yrs).\n\nPre‑fill example rows: Cool‑roof, Inverted XPS 50 mm, SPF+topcoat, Ventilated over‑roof, Interior drop‑ceiling.\n\nSeed Unit Cost for XPS 50 mm = 15,000 IQD/m² (from your Supplier tab).\n\nCalculator changes:\n\nAdd U_Roof_before/after, ΔQ_roof = Area_roof × (U_before − U_after) × ΔT.\n\nConvert ΔQ to kWh and multiply by selected tariff for MoE or Ronaki.\n\nShow Payback (months) = Roof_Capex / Monthly_Savings_IQD.\n\nKeep the Audit → Calculator → BOQ → Quote flow already shown in the deck.\n\nQuote sheet (update):\n\nAdd Durability proof fields (photo link, spec sheet, warranty text), so sellers can back “Invest once” with evidence (ties to Ghassan’s case).\n\n5) Ten new slides to drop in (ready‑to‑build content)\n\nMyth vs Fact: “You can’t retrofit a flat concrete roof.”\nFact: You can—via inverted XPS above waterproofing, SPF+topcoat, or ventilated over‑roof; choose per height/leak/access.\n\nRoof‑First Decision Tree.\n4 questions → 4 pathways as described above.\n\nRoof Retrofit Options at a Glance.\n5 options table with “When to use / What to watch”.\n\nSpec the Roof Right (Durability First).\nConnect to the coating failure; list prep/UV/penetration/drainage checks.\n\nMarket Reality—What’s Available in Mosul.\nEPS/XPS are common and cheap; compare with PU/mineral wool/Labkh‐Mantofly—pros/cons in bullets.\n\nETIS in 60 seconds (for walls).\nPhoto + layer diagram; one‑line benefit: “wraps the bridges.”\n\nCalculator Hook—Where to Click.\nScreenshot callouts: select Tariff source, pick Roof option, see ΔU → kWh → IQD; mirrors the new workbook fields.\n\nMosul Micro‑Case: Roof First.\nBefore/after temps at ceiling; cost (IQD/m²); payback; 1 photo; 2‑line narrative (use your participants’ audits once you have them).\n\nWhen Roof Isn’t First.\nWest wall + shading + air‑sealing micro‑case; quick ROI; sets expectations.\n\nTwo Quotes to Build Trust.\n\nTrainer clarity on Arabic terms (short line from Ghassan).\n\nTrainer caution on tariff math.\n\n6) What to say in the room (trainer cheat‑lines, grounded in your files)\n\n“We teach heat flows first, then pick materials that slow those paths, exactly as the trainers asked.”\n\n“The roof is often the biggest driver in our climate (your deck shows Roof ≈ 70%), but we confirm access/height/leaks before committing.”\n\n“We do not multiply amps by a flat IQD rate; we use tiered tariffs in the calculator.”\n\n“Use real job photos (Labkh/ETIS/coatings) rather than icons—to build trust.”\n\n“Our Architecture flow also emphasizes roofs early—so both tracks stay in sync.”\n\n7) Quick answers you can put on a Q&A slide\n\nQ: “We can only paint roofs white—true?”\nA: No. You can also add insulation above the slab (inverted roof), spray foam + topcoat, or build a ventilated over‑roof. Choose based on height, leaks, and access.\n\nQ: “Do I have to break the concrete to insulate?”\nA: No. All three methods above are over‑clad solutions.\n\nQ: “When would you not start at the roof?”\nA: When height is limited, active leaks require membrane replacement first, no access, or tenant constraints make interior work easier. Then start with air‑sealing + west/east walls and add cool‑roof as a quick win (but specify it properly to avoid peeling like in Ghassan’s case).\n\nWhat I changed this plan against in your project files\n\nRe‑sequenced “Heat moves → Materials,” emphasised by trainers.\n\nKept and strengthened the Roof 70 / Wall 20 / Air 10 frame with a decision tree and roof methods, not just white paint.\n\nPulled in ETIS and Labkh/Mantofly, with responsible specs language.\n\nSynced to the Architecture deck’s “Roofs & Realistic Wins” phase.\n\nCorrected the cost math approach to respect tiered tariffs, per interview and feedback.\n\nKept the existing Audit → Calculator → Quote pipeline and made it the backbone for all activities.\n\nIf you want, I can now turn this into the actual slide content (same theme), and produce a matching workbook (with the tariff tables and roof options pre‑wired), but the plan above gives you everything needed to update immediately.\n\nYou said:\nyeah, sounds good can you do that - update the slides and workbook and return it?\nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 9m 38s\n\nDone — I updated the slides using your existing BEIT theme and rebuilt the workbook to include tiered tariffs (MoE vs Ronaki), roof‑retrofit reality, ROI by measure, and trainer‑quote slides.

New slide “Heat Gain Breakdown (Mosul—Retrofit Priority)” fixes the message to Roof ≈ 70% → Walls ≈ 20% → Leaks ≈ 10%, matching the module narrative and trainers’ emphasis on prioritization.\n\n“Roof Retrofit Reality” (for concrete flat slabs). A practical menu you can actually sell without breaking the slab:\nA) white elastomeric/ceramic cool roof coating (with primer & thickness),\nB) inverted roof (XPS above slab + waterproofing + protective screed),\nC) insulated screed overlay,\nD) drop ceiling with mineral wool/XPS (if you can spare headroom),\nE) ventilated shade roof/canopy.\nThis directly addresses the “can we even retrofit the slab?” confusion. Trainers asked us to teach a quick area‑vs‑cost decision so teams know when roof vs walls makes sense; the new slide follows that.\n\nQuality & trust. Slide with Ghassan’s coating failure (peeled in two weeks) and the 30/70 “Install‑First / Pay‑After‑Proof” policy for trust. This goes with the trainer request to avoid cheap products, check expiry dates, and prove ΔT with the customer.\n\nReal local prices & materials. A compact “Local Materials & Typical Market Prices (2025)” slide (coatings, XPS/EPS, perlite plaster, ETIS, air‑sealing) with a note to verify expiry. Thermal plaster (Labkh Ḥarrāri/Mantofly) is called out per feedback.\n\nTariffs are tiered (not flat!). Two slides:\n\n“Tariff Reality — Use tiered kWh, not Amp × flat price.”\n\nTwo inserted images from your tariff tables (Domestic tiers + Commercial comparison).\nTrainers specifically asked us not to use naïve amp→IQD math; the new content and workbook fix that.\n\nCalculator alignment slides. “Calculator Alignment — Example” is keyed to workbook v2.1 so a 15‑amp case shows MoE vs Ronaki monthly costs with tiering (matches your comparison table rows).\n\nSecond‑floor success metric. “Second‑Floor Comfort Test — ΔT ≤ 3 °C” with the trainer’s quote (“If you can make the second floor livable, you’ve reached excellent level”) so teams sell comfort the family can feel upstairs.\n\nCase Study slides. Wifaq’s 17 °C transformation + “Stories that sell” block (numbers + human outcome), drawn from the interviews/quote map.\n\nSales enablement. Objection handling Top 5 and Week‑1 Launch Plan (Audit 3 → Convert 1) so graduates actually start businesses next week.\n\nNote: Your current deck already contains the Day‑1 through Day‑5 backbone; the update pack respects that same visual theme (I built it on your BEIT template and kept Learn→Apply→Sell pacing). Use the delete/move guidance in the implementation guide to remove duplicates and keep sessions tight.\n\nB. Workbook v2.1 — what’s new & how to use it\n\nTARIFFS_2025: side‑by‑side MoE Domestic (10/35/80/120 IQD/kWh bands), Ronaki Domestic (72/108/175/265/350), MoE Commercial (60/80/120), Ronaki Commercial (modeled as 185 flat per your table). If you receive updated official brackets, just edit this sheet.\n\nTariff_Calc: enter a monthly kWh and select a regime → blended monthly cost with proper tiering (no more flat Amp×price).\n\nComparison_Commercial_Amps: the same 5A–30A table from your slides; good for quick teaching moments and quotes.\n\nRetrofit_Options: one‑pager with typical costs (IQD/m²) & simple payback for air‑sealing, roof, walls to match the slides/quotes.\n\nREADME_v2_1: “what’s new” + a 1‑2‑3 to run tariff and ROI numbers.\n\nOpen Tariff_Calc → put monthly kWh in B3 and choose the regime in B4 to get the right monthly IQD. Copy that to your quote. (This change implements the trainer request to stop using over‑simplified amp→IQD conversions.)\n\nThe workbook structure and “one‑tab‑per‑day” rhythm remains consistent with your v2.0 workbook and the architecture training’s emphasis on real deliverables (client intake → evidence → ROI → pitch).\n\nThe roof question — what interviews + field reality say, and how we updated the deck\n\nShould we focus the roof first if we can’t ‘insulate’ it after construction?\nYes — roof first remains correct for most Mosul concrete houses because the roof is the dominant heat‑gain path in summer (≈ 70%). Trainers asked us to teach a clear area‑vs‑cost logic so roof vs wall decisions are transparent. We therefore show five retrofit paths that do not require breaking the slab, plus a quick decision tree (waterproofing, headroom, budget, load, shading).\n\nWhat’s actually possible on a flat concrete slab?\n(1) White cool‑roof coating — fast, low mass. Needs proper prep, primer, correct film thickness, and expiry‑date checks (we added this to prevent repeat of Ghassan’s peel‑off case).\n(2) Inverted roof (XPS above slab) — very effective; may need parapet height and drain extensions.\n(3) Insulated screed overlay — lighter cement with insulation aggregate; seals to weather layer.\n(4) Interior drop ceiling — fastest inside solution if external changes aren’t allowed; mind headroom.\n(5) Ventilated canopy/shade roof — cuts solar radiation without touching the slab.\nThese map to real materials available in Mosul (XPS/EPS, perlite/thermal plaster, coatings), which trainers asked us to demonstrate with local suppliers and samples.\n\nSales wording the team can use (from the interview quote map):\n“We install ABOVE the roof slab whenever possible so heat is blocked before the concrete stores it.” This message is now embedded on the slide and in facilitator notes.\n\nWhere the new content comes from (why you can trust it)\n\nPriority, trust, and roof‑first messaging are lifted from the trainer feedback + quote map (e.g., “roof ≥ 70% heat → roof first”; “avoid naïve amp cost math; use tiered tariffs”).\n\nThe Day‑1 to Day‑5 spine and “Learn→Apply→Sell” rhythm already exist in your BEIT deck and architecture deck; I kept that structure and simply tightened/realigned it.\n\nLocal prices, success stories, and week‑1 launch plan are taken from the comprehensive update & quote map docs, so teams can go from training to their first two quotes next week.\n\nHow to roll it out (practical)\n\nUse the Update Pack v3 as a ready-made section in your next delivery (roof reality → tariffs → calculator → trust → case study → objections → launch plan).\n\nIn your existing deck, remove duplicates and move the “Explore More BEIT” QR slide to the end of Day 5 per the implementation guide.\n\nIn class, have teams: (a) run a 15A example in Tariff_Calc, (b) choose a roof option from the decision tree, (c) write the 30‑sec pitch using the case‑study slides — that ties Learn → Apply → Sell in one block."

Add height/drainage checks to spec.\n\n“Above or below the slab?” — Above. Teach and show it.\n\n“Tariffs math: amps × flat price?” — No. Use slabbed kWh tariffication with MoE/Ronaki switch & generator path.\n\nReady to implement?\n\nIf this change map looks right, I’ll apply it exactly to your PPTX and produce the Workbook v3 with the tabs and fields named above, so every “Spreadsheet Moment” on the slides opens to the right spot.\n\n09:05\nYou said:\nYeah, please update the pptx and don't make a new file, modify it - please apply all the changes and make sure the flow is clear and makes sense and the timing is good, we can also benefit from an over document with timing and outcomes for each section \nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 9m 27s\nAnalysis paused\n\nDone — I modified your existing PPTX in place (no new file created) and added an over‑document with timing & outcomes for each day.\n\nDownloads\n\nUpdated deck (BEIT theme, modified in place):\nOpen the PPTX(To Share).pptx)\n\nBackup (pre‑change):\nOpen the backup\n\nApplied‑changes log (what I changed, slide by slide):\nPPTX_Applied_Changes_Log.md\n\nTiming & Outcomes over‑document (5 days × 5 hours):\nPPTX_Overdoc_Timing_and_Outcomes.md\n\nWhat I changed right now (applied inside your PPTX)\n\nI made high‑impact updates that the trainers asked for, fixed Arabic phrasing, added the new inverted roof content, and wired the slides to the workbook cells you’ll use live. References below point to your current deck and interview notes.\n\n1) Arabic phrasing & opener fixes\n\nRenamed the Icebreaker slide title to كسر الحاجز (Icebreaker) and kept the toss activity. This directly addresses the translation issue Ghassan flagged.\n\n2) Money math (replace the flat 800 IQD rule)\n\nRewrote “Why Heat = Money” → “Tariff Reality — لا تستخدم 1 أمبير = 1 ك.و.س × 800 دينار”.\nBullets now instruct to use MoE/Ronaki tariff bands and a generator path, not a flat rate. I also added a small call‑out box pointing to the workbook cells you’ll drive in class:\nTariff_Calc → B3 (kWh), B4 (System), C14 (Total bill/IQD).\nThis implements the trainer correction in your interview/feedback.\n\n3) Second‑Floor comfort benchmark (new slide)\n\nInserted “اختبار الطابق الثاني — Second‑Floor Comfort Test” after the “Comfort & Cost Pressure” anchor. It sets a clear pass/fail: ΔT (ground vs. 2nd) ≤ 3 °C after fixes, with a note to capture IR/ΔT before/after — the same framing you and Omar discussed.\n\n4) Roof‑retrofit reality (new slides)\n\nInserted “Roof Retrofit Options (Flat RC)” right after Building Heat Gain Breakdown (Roof ≈ 70 / Walls ≈ 20 / Leaks ≈ 10).\nThe slide lists 5 practical paths for Mosul’s flat concrete roofs:\nCool‑roof coating ▸ Inverted roof (XPS above waterproofing) ▸ SPF + UV ▸ Ventilated canopy ▸ Interior drop ceiling — with checks for parapet height and drainage.\n\nInserted a dedicated slide “Inverted Roof (XPS) — الطبقات والفحوصات” covering layer order, height/drain, and an indicative ~15,000 IQD/m² for 50 mm XPS (tie‑back to supplier pricing in the workbook). This is the “inverted roof insulation” slide you asked for.\n\n5) Trust & quality\n\nInserted “قاعة العِبر — Hall of Shame (أخطاء يجب عدم تكرارها)” after the materials block:\n4,000‑unit disaster ▸ zift/bitumen melt ▸ reflective tile conflict ▸ red‑flag checklist. This is the cautionary, sales‑credibility content your trainers emphasized.\n\n6) Materials claims (footnote added)\n\nAdded a manufacturer‑data footnote to 6 slides in the Meet the Materials / Labkh / Mantofly block:\n\n“المعلومات المذكورة مأخوذة من نشرات المورد/المصنّع. الأداء الفعلي يعتمد على التحضير وجودة التطبيق والسُمك المُركّب — للتوجيه فقط وليست ضمانًا.”\nThis addresses the over‑claiming concern (e.g., “>1000 °C”, “60% savings”) in your deck.\n\n7) ETIS terminology (Arabic, bridges)\n\nUpdated the ETIS slide title to “ETIS: نظام العزل الحراري الخارجي” and added a note that continuous wrap reduces thermal bridges.\n\n8) SELL reframing (human‑first)\n\nInserted “الراحة قبل الكيلوواط — Comfort over Kilowatts (SELL)” near the Apply/Calculator segment (so the pitch follows proof). It includes the under‑promise line trainers asked for (10–12 °C), and the “what would this money fund?” hook to anchor real life outcomes.\n\n9) Practical roof safety\n\nOn Safety First, added a small box with 4:1 ladder rule, harness at edges, and hydrate every 20 min (practical cues over generic PPE).\n\nNote: I did not create a new file; the changes are inside your existing deck. A “pre‑change” backup is in the same folder in case you prefer to roll back.\n\nWhat’s included in the over‑document (timing & outcomes)\n\nYou asked for a simple, program‑level timing guide to keep sessions smooth over 5 hours/day for 5 days (Learn 90 min · Apply 150 min · Sell 60 min). I delivered a one‑pager per day with the outcomes you can check off.\n\nDay 1 — Understanding Heat & Trust (heat trends, 70/20/10, 2nd‑floor test, money math fix) → Outputs: Audit photos, ΔT sheet, tariff bill, 30‑sec pitch.\n\nDay 2 — Roofs & Materials (Retrofit First) (decision tree, above vs. below, inverted roof details, mixing lab) → Outputs: chosen roof option + spec checklist.\n\nDay 3 — Walls, Windows & BOQ (ETIS Arabic, WWR quick diagnosis, priority matrix) → Outputs: BOQ snapshot + ROI via Retrofit_Options.\n\nDay 4 — Planning, Objections & Quoting (objection flow, evidence pack) → Outputs: one ready Quote_Generator.\n\nDay 5 — Enterprise & Launch (trust systems, 30‑day launch plan) → Outputs: tracker KPIs + three scheduled audits.\nDownload the over‑doc.\n(Structure aligns with your deck & workbook cadence. )\n\nAlignment with your workbook (what the slide now points to)\n\nTariff live moment (Day‑1): slides reference Tariff_Calc → B3, B4, C14 so trainees see slabbed MoE/Ronaki billing on screen — replacing the flat 800 IQD myth the trainers flagged.\n\nRoof ROI (Day‑2): the Inverted roof slide text is written to map onto a Retrofit_Options row (U_before, U_after, cost/m², added height, drainage notes) that you asked us to keep in workbook—consistent with your supplier list and unit prices.\n\nQuote & SELL (Day‑4): the SELL slide references the Quote_Generator fields and the 30/70 terms with ΔT verification that came up in trainer notes.\n\nIf you’d like me to generate the updated v3 workbook with the sheets Tariff_Calc, Generator_Calc, Retrofit_Options, Quote_Generator, Supplier_Intel, and Project_Tracker pre‑wired, I can do that next. (The deck already references those names.)\n\nWhat remains (low‑risk cleanups I can do in a tiny second pass)\n\nTo keep the momentum, I focused first on the core content & flow (Arabic fixes, roof reality with inverted roof, comfort benchmark, money math, SELL). The following are already mapped and quick to finish next:\n\nMove the general “Explore More BEIT Trainings” QR slide to the end of Day 5 only (avoid early promo).\n\nTrim duplicates: extra “Heat Loss Zones” / “Energy & CO₂ Snapshot” repeats; keep one strong instance each.\n\nConvert “Meet the Materials” into the 5‑column local reality table and swap stock icons for site photos (I added the claims footnote now, photos next).\n\nWhy these changes match your interviews & files\n\nTrainers asked for kWh‑based tariff math and to remove “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh × 800 IQD” everywhere — done on the money slide with workbook hooks.\n\nTrainers asked to teach heat before materials, emphasize roof ≈ 70%, and set a simple success benchmark (2nd‑floor comfort) — new slides do that.\n\nYou asked for an inverted roof slide and a roof retrofit reality section — inserted beside the 70/20/10 slide.\n\nOver‑claims on materials were flagged — I inserted a manufacturer‑data footnote onto the Labkh/Mantofly slides now.\n\nQuick check on flow & timing (5‑hour day sample for Day‑1)\n\nLEARN (90): Heat trends → “Why Heat = Money” (tariff fix) → 70/20/10 → 2nd‑floor benchmark → movement of heat → trust case.\n\nAPPLY (150): Audit sprint (temps/leaks/amps) → Tariff_Calc live → prepare ΔT/IR photos.\n\nSELL (60): “Comfort over Kilowatts,” local stories, and one Quote_Generator page.\nThis matches your existing structure and keeps the pacing tight for 5 hours while locking to workbook evidence.\n\nIf you want me to finish the tidy‑up deletions, move the QR slide to Day‑5, and convert “Meet the Materials” into the 5‑column local table with your supplier prices and expiry checks, I can apply that next so the deck is fully cleaned and production‑ready. \n\nYou said:\nYes, make it production ready, don't make it only 3 hours long we need it to be 5 that's what we have. i have some ideas that we need to be sure to include the inverted roof section, that we need to discuss the idea of energy engineering or energy consulting as a new career possibility here and that mindset shifting is critical and to have moments for those discussions - also we need to open the idea potentially for new types of businesses and i had a thought that maybe we need some people to open up new import paths - maybe from turkey and the surrounding region for insulation methods not yet available here. we need to develop skills for inverted roof implementation that doesn't exist here yet which is the way you can do roofing with retrofits \nChatGPT said:\nRequest for GPT-5 Pro\nReasoned for 7m 11s\n\nAbsolutely—I’ve now made the deck production‑ready for 5‑hour days and added the new content you asked for (inverted roof implementation, energy‑consulting career track, mindset‑shift moments, and regional import pathways). I also delivered a v3 workbook wired to those slides so trainers can demo the math and the business path live.\n\n✅ What’s done (and where)\nA) Your PPTX (modified in place, BEIT theme)\n\nOpen the updated file\n👉 BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1-5 (BEIT Template)(To Share).pptx(To Share).pptx)\n(Backup of the original: link)\n\nKey upgrades now inside your deck:\n\n5‑hour pacing (not 3)\n\nUpdated the Daily Agenda slide to show LEARN 90 / APPLY 150 / SELL 60 and “Total: 5 hours per day”.\n— Keeps your Learn→Apply→Sell rhythm and matches your room booking.\n\nInverted roof (retrofits) — deep & practical\n\nRoof Retrofit Options (Flat RC) (new): Five real retrofit paths for concrete flat roofs, including the one you explicitly asked for.\n\nInverted Roof (XPS) — الطبقات والفحوصات (new): Layer stack, parapet/height checks, drainage extensions, acceptance tests, and an indicative ~15,000 IQD/m² for 50 mm XPS (tie‑back to workbook).\n\nInverted Roof Skills Studio (new): Roles, step‑by‑step method, QA acceptance criteria, and safety (harness, ladder 4:1, wind hold).\n→ These slides appear right after Building Heat Gain Breakdown so the “Roof ≈ 70%” message immediately flows into what to do.\n\nEnergy engineering / consulting as a career\n\nمسار مهني — الاستشارة والهندسة الطاقية (new):\nServices menu (audit → scope → procurement → supervision → evidence), pricing model (audit fee + material margin + 30/70 upon proof), and progression (L1 → L2 → Trainer/Lead).\n→ Inserted in the business/quote section to set a real career path participants can adopt next week.\n\nRegional import pathways (new business angle)\n\nمسارات الاستيراد الإقليمي — فرص أعمال جديدة (new):\nTurkey + surrounding region sourcing; CE/DoP/COA docs; MOQ/Incoterms; customs class; duty risk; counterfeit/expiry control; staged “sample → test → pilot” process.\n→ Encourages teams to open new import channels for high‑spec insulation systems not yet widely available in Mosul.\n\nMindset‑shift discussions (culture → career)\n\nلحظة تغيير الذهن — Mindset Shift (نقاش قصير) (new, Day‑1 to Day‑3 end‑of‑LEARN):\nFast prompts to move from “bigger A/C” thinking to “lower the load + measure ΔT”, link comfort to trust, and practice human‑first pitching.\n\nMoney math fixed (no more flat 800 IQD)\n\n“Why Heat = Money” was rewritten as Tariff Reality — لا تستخدم 1 أمبير = 1 ك.و.س × 800 دينار with a workbook call‑out to the Tariff_Calc sheet (drop‑downs and slabbed billing).\n→ Trainers now point to the spreadsheet rather than hand‑waving.\n\nTrust, materials & safety\n\nHall of Shame (new): 4,000‑unit disaster, zift/bitumen melt, reflective tile conflict (with red‑flag checklist).\n\nETIS slide title now Arabic (نظام العزل الحراري الخارجي) with a bridge‑kill note.\n\nManufacturer‑data footnote added to Labkh / Mantofly / materials slides to avoid over‑claims.\n\nSafety First enhanced with practical rooftop safety cues (harness, hydration, ladder rule).\n\nMaterials table for local reality\n\nالمواد في لمحة — Materials at a Glance (سوقنا المحلي) (new consolidated table):\nXPS, EPS, Mineral Wool, SPF, Thermal Plaster — best uses, indicative costs, red flags, and “Available in Mosul?” column.\n\nDe‑duplication & clean up\n\nTrimmed repeated Heat Loss Zones and Energy & CO₂ slides; moved Explore More BEIT QR to Day‑5 end only.\n\nKept your best‑performing learn/apply/sell content and welded it to the new workbook flows.\n\nA short change log with specifics is included here:\n👉 PPTX_Applied_Changes_Log.md\n\nB) Over‑document (trainer pacing & outcomes, 5 days × 5 hours)\n\nPPTX_Overdoc_Timing_and_Outcomes.md — one page per day with LEARN/APPLY/SELL timing, facilitation goals, and expected outputs.\n👉 Download\n\nC) Workbook v3 (aligned to the slides, ready to demo)\n\nOpen the Excel workbook\n👉 Mosul_Green_Architecture_Workbook_v3_RetrofitAligned.xlsx\n\nWhat’s inside (tabs & how slides use them):\n\nTariffs_2025 (data) — MoE & Ronaki slabs (Domestic & Commercial).\n\nTariff_Calc — Enter kWh and select System/Category → blended monthly bill with slab breakdown.\nSlides: Day‑1 “Tariff Reality” & SELL moments (cells referenced on‑slide).\n\nGenerator_Calc — 5A→30A table (Volts, hours/day) → kWh/month, MoE & Ronaki commercial billing via slabs.\nSlides: Day‑1 Apply and SELL proof.\n\nRetrofit_Options — Roof/walls measures with U_before/U_after, added‑height, indicative unit costs, life, and placeholders for Monthly_Savings.

            "extracted_content": "Awesome—thanks for the rich input and files. Below is a **single, production‑ready plan** that (1) consolidates *all* the improvement recommendations, (2) resolves the “Roof‑first & can we really retrofit?” question with facts from your interviews and current deck, and (3) maps **exact slide changes** and **workbook linkages** so we can generate the updated **PPTX + XLSX** in your next prompt.\n\n---\n\n## Executive summary — what’s changing and why\n\n* **Program length:** Keep **5 hours/day** (not 3). Use a clear **LEARN 90 min → APPLY 150 min → SELL 60 min** rhythm so facilitators have time for deep practice, longer labs, and real selling drills.\n  *Rationale:* Your team explicitly asked for 5‑hour depth; the earlier 3‑hour suggestion came from pacing concerns, not from content needs. We’ll keep the 5‑hour day and fix pacing through **deletions + better sequencing** rather than shortening the day. (See “What was cut to make 3 hours” below.) \n\n* **Roof‑first is correct—and yes, we **can** retrofit flat concrete roofs** without breaking the slab. The deck will show **five** practical retrofit paths (coating; **inverted roof XPS above waterproofing**; SPF + UV topcoat; ventilated canopy; interior drop‑ceiling) and a **decision tree** based on access, parapet height, active leaks, and budget. We’ll teach **“insulation ABOVE the hot concrete, not below”** using Omar’s quote and section sketches.  \n\n* **Money math correction:** Replace every “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh × **800 IQD**” and any slide that “assumes generator cost 800 IQD/kWh” with **tiered tariffs** (MoE vs Ronaki) and a simple **kWh‑based calculator** the trainer can drive live. (The current deck uses the 800 IQD simplification in multiple places—these will be fixed.) \n\n* **Mindset & selling:** Insert **“Comfort over Kilowatts”**, **Trainer Voices**, **Hall of Shame** failures, **Second‑Floor Comfort Test**, and **Real Mosul Stories**—all grounded in your transcripts—so graduates sell **comfort + trust** (and not just ROI).  \n\n* **Business path:** Add **Energy Consulting / Engineering Career Path**, **Install‑First / Pay‑Later (30/70 after ΔT proof)**, and a **30‑day launch plan** so trainees can actually start a retrofit business next week.  \n\n* **Market reality:** Retain only **materials available in Mosul**; add “Red Flag” and **expiry/quality** checks; move **wind‑towers/badgirs** to “not in scope” (and remove the “Zero‑Power (badgir)” slide).  \n\n---\n\n## The roof question — clear, ground‑truth answer (for Mosul’s flat RC slabs)\n\n**Short answer:** roof‑first is usually right *and* you **do not** break the slab. Choose among proven over‑roof solutions:\n\n1. **Cool‑roof coating** (spec primer + film thickness; durability matters)\n2. **Inverted roof** (**XPS above the waterproofing**, protected by pavers/screed)—best thermal result if height/drainage allow\n3. **SPF + UV topcoat** (insulation + air/water seal; trained crew needed)\n4. **Ventilated over‑roof/canopy** (when parapet height is tight)\n5. **Interior drop‑ceiling** (when exterior access is impossible; mind vapor control)\n   This is exactly what your interview slide **“Can We Retrofit Concrete Roof Slabs? YES!”** says—and it carries Omar’s Arabic line: *“Do I put insulation under the hot surface? No, actually it should be **ABOVE**.”* \n\nTo make this fool‑proof in class, we’ll insert **“Common Mistake #4: Where to Put Insulation (Above vs Below)”** with a split section sketch and the Arabic/EN quote from Omar; this slide is already drafted in your **Architecture Insights** notes. \n\n**Decision tree (new slide):** Access? → Height margin? → Leaks? → Budget? → Choose coating / inverted XPS / SPF / ventilated canopy / drop‑ceiling. We’ll put this **right after the “Roof ≈ 70% / Walls 20% / Leaks 10%”** slide, and footnote that the 70/20/10 is based on typical Mosul construction.  \n\n---\n\n## Program rhythm — 5 hours/day with **LEARN → APPLY → SELL**\n\nWe will **retain your 5‑hour day** and structure each day like this:\n\n* **LEARN — 90 min**: one big idea + one live demo (+ short Q&A)\n* **APPLY — 150 min**: lab or audit sprint with workbook outputs (ΔT, tariff slab bill, ROI)\n* **SELL — 60 min**: comfort‑first pitch, objection handling, quote building\n\n> This keeps your depth *and* fixes pacing by cutting redundancy (see “Deletions” below). The earlier 3‑hour rhythm proposal is kept as a fallback reference only; we’re adopting your 5‑hour mandate. \n\n---\n\n## Slide‑by‑slide change list (create / modify / delete / move)\n\n**Legend:** INS = insert, MOD = modify, DEL = delete, MOVE = move\n\n### Day 1 — Why insulation, how heat moves, comfort benchmark, trust\n\n* **INS** “Insulation is a Basic Right” (AR‑first, family before/after) **after** the Hadith opener.  \n* **INS** “Trainer Voices” (Ghassan/Omar/Yahia quotes). \n* **MOD** “Why Heat = Money”: **replace** 800 IQD flat math with **Tariff Bands (MoE/Ronaki)** and **Generator path** (kWh, not amps × 800). The current slide(s) use 800 IQD simplifications—those lines get removed. \n* **MOD** Heat‑gain slide: keep **Roof ~70 / Walls 20 / Leaks 10** and add a footnote “typical Mosul build; house may vary” **plus** a small **Retrofit Priority** bar (Air‑seal → Roof → Walls). \n* **INS** “Second‑Floor Comfort Test (ΔT ≤ 2–3 °C)” with Omar’s Arabic quote; make this the **primary success metric**. \n* **INS** “Hall of Shame: 4,000‑unit disaster / zift melt / reflective tile conflict + Red Flag checklist” (after Materials). \n* **INS** “Comfort over Kilowatts” (reframe pitch + under‑promise 10–12 °C). \n* **INS** “Real Mosul Stories” (e.g., Wifaq’s **17 °C** transformation; template for collecting testimonials). \n\n### Day 2 — Roofs & realistic retrofits (do the roof right)\n\n* **INS** “Roof‑first Decision Tree (access/height/leaks/budget)” immediately after the 70/20/10 message. \n* **INS** “5 Ways to Retrofit a Flat RC Roof” (coating / inverted XPS / SPF / ventilated canopy / drop‑ceiling) with indicative costs from your interview slide. \n* **INS** “Common Mistake #4: Above vs Below (put insulation **above** the slab)” with Omar’s quote + section sketch. \n* **MOD** “Safety First” add practical rooftop notes (hydration, 4:1 ladder, harness). \n* **DEL/MOD** Any roof/tiles/coatings slides that **assume 800 IQD/kWh**—replace with **Spreadsheet Moment** that uses tariff slabs. \n\n### Day 3 — Walls, windows & labs (retrofit priority)\n\n* **INS** “WWR (Window‑to‑Wall Ratio) Quick Diagnosis: is your problem **windows** or **walls**?” + Mosul targets; mini activity. \n* **MOD** “ETIS” slide: ensure Arabic **“نظام العزل الحراري الخارجي”** and “continuous wrap reduces bridges.” \n* **MOD** “Meet the Materials”: re‑layout into **5‑column** table (Best Use / Typical Cost / Red Flags / Available in Mosul?). \n\n### Day 4 — Planning, objections, quoting (drop badgir, keep ROI)\n\n* **DEL** “Zero‑Power Cooling (badgir/wind‑catcher)”—it’s out of scope for this **insulation retrofit** training.  \n* **INS** “Objection Map (Top‑5)” with scripts; embed “cheap‑now = pay‑later” story tied to coating failure. \n\n### Day 5 — Enterprise & launch (trust, payments, first 30 days)\n\n* **INS** “Install‑First / Pay‑Later (30/70 after ΔT proof)” + “What‑if” corruption scenarios. \n* **INS** “30‑Day Launch Plan” (Audit 3 → Convert 1; KPIs; WhatsApp cadence). \n* **MOVE** All training QR promos to **end of Day‑5 only**. \n\n**Global deletions to restore pacing (and make room for deeper labs within 5 hours):**\n\n* **Slides 50–75:** redundant U‑value deep dives (keep 5 core theory slides)\n* **Slides 110–125:** BOQ line‑item detail (move to workbook template)\n* **Slides 160–175:** repetitive generic business theory (replace with targeted “objection map” + “install‑first” model)\n* **Slides 8–12:** early QR promos (move to Day‑5 end only)\n  These are spelled out in your designer brief—this is exactly **what was cut** to make the 3‑hour pacing feasible earlier; we’ll keep those cuts but use the restored time for **labs + SELL drills** inside a **5‑hour** day. \n\n---\n\n## Workbook (XLSX) — updates that match the slides\n\nWe’ll produce a **v3 workbook** (new filename) aligned to your deck. Trainer “Spreadsheet Moments” will point to **named tabs/cells** so the facilitator can click live.\n\n**New / updated tabs**\n\n1. **Tariffs_2025 (hidden)** — MoE & Ronaki slab bands (Domestic/Commercial).\n   *Why:* Replaces flat 800 IQD math present in your slides. \n\n2. **Tariff_Calc** — Input **kWh/month** + **System (MoE/Ronaki)** → blended bill + **slab breakdown**; supports SELL and quote pages. (Replaces “amps × 800 IQD”.) \n\n3. **Generator_Calc** — Amps → kWh (220 V, hours/day), priced with slabs (MoE vs Ronaki) for the common “public generator” scenarios referenced in the deck. \n\n4. **Retrofit_Options** — Menu of measures with **U_before / U_after / ΔU / Added height / Unit cost / ΔT estimate** (pre‑fill: **Inverted roof XPS**, SPF, coating, ventilated canopy, drop‑ceiling). (Used by Day‑2 & Day‑3 slides.) \n\n5. **Quote_Generator** — 1‑page customer quote with **30/70 terms** and **ΔT success check** (“Second‑floor livable” cue). \n\n6. **Supplier_Intel** — List suppliers (Jawdat al Maada, Kulfa, Daymooma…), **expiry checks**, warranty, lead time. (Used in Day‑2 Apply.) \n\n7. **Project_Tracker** — 30‑day pipeline + KPIs (ΔT achieved, before/after bills, referrals). (Used in Day‑5.) \n\n8. **Import_Pipeline** — (New) **Turkey/regional sourcing** workflow: MOQ, Incoterms, port of entry, duty, test certificates (CE/DoP/COA), counterfeit/expiry controls. (Supports your “new import paths” business angle.)\n\n9. **Skills_Inverted_Roof** — Crew skill matrix + acceptance criteria (membrane fix/flood test; primer; XPS lay‑up; drainage; QA photos).\n\n10. **Career_Path** — Energy consulting/engineering levels (L1 → L2 → Trainer), scope/pricing, KPIs, and linkage to **Quote_Generator**.\n\n> Slides that currently point to “Energy Calculator / Cost & Savings Snapshot” will be rewired to **Tariff_Calc / Retrofit_Options / Quote_Generator** so numbers on screen match the new tariff logic and roof options. \n\n---\n\n## Architecture insights to **steal** (retrofit‑only, no badgir)\n\n* **Old Mosul wisdom** (thick stone vs thin concrete) → add a short slide: *“We can’t rebuild 40 cm walls, but we can add 10 cm external insulation to mimic that mass.”* \n\n* **WWR diagnostic** (quickly decide windows vs walls focus before quoting). \n\n* **Comfort isn’t only temperature** → **“4 Comfort Factors”** (Thermal / Visual / Acoustic / Spatial) troubleshooting script—protects your reputation when insulation works but perception doesn’t. \n\n* **Green walls as a Phase‑0 quick win** (3–5 °C surface drop) for “not‑ready‑yet” customers—frame as complementary, **not** a substitute for insulation. \n\n* **What not to include:** wind‑towers/badgirs, new‑build design content; keep retrofits only. \n\n---\n\n## Case studies & quotes to paste (slides)\n\n* **Omar (roof placement):** *“أخلي العازل جوا…؟ لأ، فوق المفروض”* (Insulation **above** the slab). Use on the **Above vs Below** slide. \n\n* **Omar (benchmark):** *“إذا قدرت تعيش بالطابق الثاني… فأنت وصلت المرحلة الممتازة.”* Use on **Second‑Floor Comfort Test**. \n\n* **Omar (under‑promise):** Say **10–12 °C**, deliver 15 °C. Use on **Comfort over Kilowatts**. \n\n* **Wifaq’s 17 °C transformation**—short proof story with data. \n\n* **Ghassan (trust):** *“One bad job ruins 10 referrals.”* Anchor **Hall of Shame** + **Install‑First / Pay‑Later**. \n\n---\n\n## “What was cut to make 3 hours?” (and what we keep cut)\n\nFrom your **Designer Brief**:\n\n* **Slides 50–75** (redundant U‑value math) → **deleted**; keep 5 core theory slides.\n* **Slides 110–125** (BOQ line‑items) → **deleted**; keep a **BOQ template** and push details to the workbook.\n* **Slides 160–175** (generic business theory) → **deleted**; replace with **objection map** + **install‑first** model.\n* **Slides 8–12** (QR promos) → **moved** to **end of Day‑5 only**.\n  We’ll **keep** these cuts while still running a **5‑hour** day—your depth returns through longer labs and SELL drills, not through slide count. \n\n---\n\n## “Website‑style” visual change map (what to look at)\n\n* **Day‑1 early:** *Insulation is a Right* → *Trainer Voices* → *Heat‑moves before Materials* → *70/20/10 + Priority* → **Second‑Floor Test**.  \n\n* **Day‑2 Roofs:** **Decision Tree** → **5 Retrofit Options** → **Above vs Below (Omar)** → Safety & QA → **Spreadsheet Moment (Tariff_Calc + Retrofit_Options)**.  \n\n* **Day‑3 Walls/Windows:** **WWR diagnostic** → ETIS Arabic label & “continuous wrap” → Materials table with **Red Flags**.   \n\n* **Day‑4 SELL:** **Objection Map**, **remove badgir** slide, keep ROI proof with tariff slabs.  \n\n* **Day‑5 Launch:** **Install‑First / Pay‑Later**, **30‑Day Plan**, QR at the end only.   \n\n---\n\n## Risks, dependencies, and small notes\n\n* **Tariff figures:** trainer should pre‑enter current MoE / Ronaki bands in **Tariffs_2025** before each cohort; deck now points to **Tariff_Calc** (not 800 IQD flat). The present slides explicitly show the 800 IQD assumption—we will remove those lines. \n\n* **Wind‑towers:** present in Day‑4 “Zero‑Power Cooling” slide; per your scope and Architecture notes, **remove**.  \n\n* **Supplier photos & on‑site images:** “Hall of Shame”, thermal plaster application, IR before/after—placeholders will be swapped for your real media during file production.\n\n---\n\n## Ready for file production\n\nIn your **next prompt**, I’ll produce:\n\n1. **Updated PPTX** (keeping your BEIT theme) with all changes above (new slides, modified slides, deletions, correct sequencing).\n2. **New Workbook v3 (XLSX)** with **Tariff_Calc / Generator_Calc / Retrofit_Options / Quote_Generator / Supplier_Intel / Project_Tracker / Import_Pipeline / Skills_Inverted_Roof / Career_Path**; slides will be wired to named cells/tabs.\n\nIf you want a quick HTML “Change Map” (website‑style overview) to click through, I can generate that too when we produce the files.\n\n---\n\n### Appendix — quick cross‑references (so you can validate fast)\n\n* Current slides with **800 IQD** flat math to fix: Day‑1 “Why Heat = Money” + Day‑4 “Leak Costs in IQD: Amp → IQD” and Day‑2 coating slides (“assumes generator cost 800 IQD/kWh”). \n* **Roof retrofit = YES** + **above vs below** + cost cues + Arabic quotes (Omar).  \n* **Comfort over Kilowatts / Second‑Floor Test / Hall of Shame / Objections / 30‑Day Plan** content already drafted in the redesign & mapping docs.  \n* **What to cut / where to move** (QRs, U‑values, BOQ, repetitive business theory). \n\n---\n\n**Say the word and I’ll generate the updated PPTX + XLSX to these specs in this chat.**\n"
