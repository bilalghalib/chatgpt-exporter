This vision is achieved by organizing various activities, cultural events, and festivals, as well as supporting government bodies involved in heritage conservation. Additionally, the foundation focuses on empowering youth and professionals through developmental training, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals to foster sustainable cities and communities.\n\n‏This concept was born in response to a series of wars and conflicts that had taken a toll on Nineveh Province, resulting in the loss of many historic cities and archaeological sites. These conflicts negatively impacted the city’s tangible and intangible heritage, cultural legacy, and led to a rise in youth unemployment, revealing an urgent need for skill development to prepare young people for the labor market and to inspire community-driven projects that benefit Iraqi society.\n\n‏The most significant and damaging event in the city’s modern history was the occupation by ISIS in 2014, followed by the liberation war in 2017. These events saw extremist groups destroy much of the remaining old city of Mosul. In response, a group of young people came together to launch the foundation as a voluntary effort, driven by a commitment to safeguarding Iraq’s identity. The project was launched to highlight archaeological and heritage sites, revive cultural heritage, and promote social cohesion among Nineveh’s diverse ethnicities and religions, aiming to foster peace and coexistence. This effort is seen as a vital step in encouraging displaced residents to return to their homes and to preserve the rich heritage and coexistence that define the city.\n\n‏The significance of establishing the “Mosul Heritage Foundation for Culture and Development” lies in preserving the historical character of the city, supporting heritage protection efforts alongside government bodies, and partnering with international organizations and the global community. The foundation also envisions fostering connections among youth through awareness-raising and developmental workshops to promote the heritage and history of Nineveh and Iraq, and implementing activities that develop the skills of professionals in culture, heritage, and development fields.\"\t\"The Foundation is committed to achieving its goals through building partnerships and expanding the fields it works in, especially in development and growth through culture, heritage, or capacity building.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s expertise and extensive network, it has earned significant community trust, with over 100,000 visitors to the Foundation in the past two years, as well as participants in its regular programs.\n\nTherefore, our vision is that the program aligns with our shared goals, and together we can achieve the best outcomes.\"\tWe believe that the Mosul Heritage Foundation and the work team have field experience and a strong network of relationships, whether with government agencies, organizations, non-governmental organizations, or the local community. Therefore, we are pleased to participate in the project to achieve common goals.\tayoobthanoon1992@gmail.com\t50\"\"\"",

This vision is achieved by organizing various activities, cultural events, and festivals, as well as supporting government bodies involved in heritage conservation. Additionally, the foundation focuses on empowering youth and professionals through developmental training, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals to foster sustainable cities and communities.\n\n‏This concept was born in response to a series of wars and conflicts that had taken a toll on Nineveh Province, resulting in the loss of many historic cities and archaeological sites. These conflicts negatively impacted the city’s tangible and intangible heritage, cultural legacy, and led to a rise in youth unemployment, revealing an urgent need for skill development to prepare young people for the labor market and to inspire community-driven projects that benefit Iraqi society.\n\n‏The most significant and damaging event in the city’s modern history was the occupation by ISIS in 2014, followed by the liberation war in 2017. These events saw extremist groups destroy much of the remaining old city of Mosul. In response, a group of young people came together to launch the foundation as a voluntary effort, driven by a commitment to safeguarding Iraq’s identity. The project was launched to highlight archaeological and heritage sites, revive cultural heritage, and promote social cohesion among Nineveh’s diverse ethnicities and religions, aiming to foster peace and coexistence. This effort is seen as a vital step in encouraging displaced residents to return to their homes and to preserve the rich heritage and coexistence that define the city.\n\n‏The significance of establishing the “Mosul Heritage Foundation for Culture and Development” lies in preserving the historical character of the city, supporting heritage protection efforts alongside government bodies, and partnering with international organizations and the global community. The foundation also envisions fostering connections among youth through awareness-raising and developmental workshops to promote the heritage and history of Nineveh and Iraq, and implementing activities that develop the skills of professionals in culture, heritage, and development fields.\"\t\"The Foundation is committed to achieving its goals through building partnerships and expanding the fields it works in, especially in development and growth through culture, heritage, or capacity building.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s expertise and extensive network, it has earned significant community trust, with over 100,000 visitors to the Foundation in the past two years, as well as participants in its regular programs.\n\nTherefore, our vision is that the program aligns with our shared goals, and together we can achieve the best outcomes.\"\tWe believe that the Mosul Heritage Foundation and the work team have field experience and a strong network of relationships, whether with government agencies, organizations, non-governmental organizations, or the local community. Therefore, we are pleased to participate in the project to achieve common goals.\tayoobthanoon1992@gmail.com\t50\"\"\"",

They have experience in solar energy installation, financial literacy, and heritage-inspired innovation, which are all key modules of the curriculum. Their track record of developing sustainability-focused training adds to their alignment.\tKapita has successfully trained 500 youth and women in various programs, with a focus on entrepreneurship and vocational skills. However, challenges in engaging marginalized groups, such as women, indicate room for improvement in outreach and inclusion.\tKapita demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability through projects integrating green technologies and practices. Their alignment with BEIT's goals of creating jobs and reducing housing costs through sustainable methods is evident, though scaling these efforts could be challenging.\tKapita is well-established with a team of 30 staff members and operational stability. Their experience with international collaborations and program management supports their capacity, though further insights into financial resources would provide a clearer picture.\tKapita employs pre- and post-assessment tools and tracks job placements as key success indicators. While proficient, their M&E framework could benefit from more structured data collection and reporting mechanisms to ensure comprehensive impact analysis.\tKapita’s use of social media and partnerships has effectively engaged youth and businesses. However, there is still a need to enhance their strategies to better connect with women and rural participants.\tKapita has demonstrated openness to collaboration, working with various stakeholders and international organizations. Their adaptive approach to curriculum development and emphasis on partnership strengthen their collaborative potential.\tPrevious partners and projects highlight Kapita’s reliability and impactful contributions. Success stories, such as Ordery and other incubation programs, affirm their capability, though the lack of detailed feedback from stakeholders is a minor gap.\t\"\"\"Interview\"\"\"\n\n00:00:02 SPK_1\n.بسيطة، إيه؟ فرانيا كانت تتعرف على نفسها إيه؟ فإذا إيه تكملين؟ وبعدين نروح على آية إن شاء الله\n\n00:00:12 SPK_2\n.آه، هو أنه على زميلتي آية هي موجودة\n\n00:00:17 SPK_3\n.مرحبا أستاذ عبد الله إن شاء\n\n00:00:19 SPK_1\n.الله أهلا وسهلا و عليكم معايا. الحمد لله كل شي بخير\n\n00:00:23 SPK_3\n.ألف الحمد لله أني أية سينير. و فرصة سعيدة تعرقنا بيها على حضرتك. و إن شاء الله يعني يكون مثمر بالنسبة إلنا إن\n\n00:00:32 SPK_1\nشاء الله إن شاء الله. و و ورانية إنت شنو كان؟ آه كابيتال؟\n\n00:00:40 SPK_2\nآه؟\n\n00:00:43 SPK_1\n.خير و محمد. السلام عليكم\n\n00:00:47 SPK_4\nعليكم السلام. اه اني محمد حميد. ال programmes ماناجر في كابيتال، احنا من نذكر كلمة programme، فنقصد هي كل البرامج التدريبية و البرامج السبونسر و اي شي ثاني يصير، و ايمينا اذا نشتغل ف كلش سعيد انه احنا نلتقي بيك اليوم اني صراحة اني و يعني وتيمي قرينا البروشور، اه بس احنا اكيد احنا دا نلتقي حتى نسولف بالتفاصيل اللي موجودة بداخله اي يعني حتى انه احنا اكيد يعني نسمع اذا تحب بعدين على كابيتال مور alيند ويا اللي إيه ويا اللي يعني ويا ال projet، ليش؟ لانه انا i think انت الريدي اخدت انترداكشن المجاهد، صح؟ يعني؟\n\n00:01:35 SPK_1\nإيه صرلي يعرف يعني مجاهد سنين و إيه؟ يعني إلتقيت مع إيه؟ الشباب من كابيتال، إيه إسمها سلوى ب إيه دبي قبل كم سنة، و إلتقينا بعدين باسطنبول، و الحمد لله يعني أعرف أعرفه يعني كابتا و أعرف إيه شوية عن اللي إذا تستاهلون عليه، و إستفادت، وهاي بنشغلكم أصلا، إيه يو مال sustainable إمباكت بالعراق، نسيت الإسم ال ال بس هذا كان جدا مفيد بالنسبة إلي بال مال ال الحمد لله، فصار تعاون، ومتى؟ ماذا تعرفون يعني يو يو release it\n\n00:02:24 SPK_4\nنحنا؟ أوكي إحنا هواي برودكت تطلع من ال\n\n00:02:28 SPK_1\nإيه؟\n\n00:02:29 SPK_4\nبالنهاية it's for public يعني؟ إيه which is very nice to me too.

ويا هوايا جهات، ويا هوايا شركات، وهسا حاليا هنينا دا نشتغل، ويا شركات أخرى مثل المسيوبيشي، آه بعدنا مستمر مستمرين بالشغل، ويا آسيا سيل وشغلنا، وياهمينة، سابقا كنا مشتغلين همين، ويا ال على بحث سابق، ويا سامي آه ف هذا الحكي، يمكن كان 2020 أو 2021، ما أتذكر بالضبط ف يعني. هو همينة يعني مشتغلين سابقا، ويا ال بهذا المشروع. آه، فيعني نوعا ما إحنا حتى من ناحية فمشتغلين وياه هوايا شركات و عندنا يعني بخلال هذا شغلنا وياه جهات خلانا أنه نفتهم العراقي أكثر خلانا نفتهم، ال شنو يريدون بالضبط، و خلانا إنه إحنا نوسع من آه شبكة العلاقات مالتنا، بحيث إنه إحنا نقدر نكبر آه الشغل أو نكبر هواية شغلات متعلقة، مو بس ببغداد، وإنما حتى بباقي المحافظات مثل الموصل. انبار غيرها من من المحافظات وجدنا همين شغلات ومشاريع وبرامج قدرنا ننفذها. ويا هاي المحافظات بالتعاون همين، ويا جهات إيه؟ ومؤسسات؟ هي موجودة بهاي المحافظات، فنوعا ما نقدر نقول انه احنا يعني\n\n00:20:06 SPK_3\nلا نفتهم السوق اكثر يوم عن يوم، و وشغلنا وياهم. ديخلينا همينة نستوعب انه شنو اللي ينراد نسوي، وشنو ال اللي موجودة بالسوق؟ وشلون احنا لازم نسوي حتى نحل هاي ال. فبناءا على الشرح اللي شرحته حضرتك للمشروع، طبعا كلش عاشت إيدك المشروع كلش. بس إحنا عندنا بصراحة عدة أسئلة يعني على مود إنه نكون شوي يعني. آه تمام، أول شي بالنسبة للمشروع هو يعني إيش قدر ال مالته؟ يعني كبروجيكت أو اللي هو إيش قدري مالته؟ وإحنا؟ هل رح نكون هذا ال كله لو أكو أو\n\n00:20:52 SPK_3\nاللي هي هاي، آه إحنا اللي رح نكون بس بيها\n\n00:20:58 SPK_1\ndurational، مشروع أربع سنين، و أتوقع إيه ال إلى أن يعني أني يجوز ما أعرف إيه كل شي من المشروع، بس إيه إلى أن يوصلون الأرقام اللي محتاجيها. آه، وأتوقع يعني مثل سابي يتحول، يتغير المشروع من التعليم إلى التطبيق، ف i think ماكو يعني أيام محدودة لو ولا شي، بس آه بالأول سنتين. والتطبيق يعني grajultyly للتطبيق لمن؟ اوكي، فا؟\n\n00:21:38 SPK_3\n.يعني نقدر نقول انو هسه هاي الجرني او هذا تايم لاين اللي مرسوم، هسه حاليا قدامنا اللي هو تقريبا سنة الى سنتين ال مالته\n\n00:21:50 SPK_1\nآه ال العدد اللي يحتاجون يفوتون ويكملوني يسوون تدريب 500 و حت، وبعدين كم؟ يعني كم مرة لازم يتوقع؟ حيكون نقاش رح كم مرة لازم نسوي ال نسوي؟ نخلي وقت لل feedback اذا راح نسوي ال pilot مال ميتين بيت نسويها بيت يعني 50505050505050. و اذا نسويها على هالعادة رح يكون ديزاين للتوقيت و مع ال آه و مع ال و ان شاء الله ال يحبون يرجعوني، و اذا ما رجعوني رح تحجنو، ويا آه شخص من ال ثاني، بس هيك توقع رح يصير لانه اكو اهداف و اكو ارقام اللي لازم نوصلها اه بس ال او الايام و الاوقات اتوقع رح يكون بالنقاش. يعني اذا اذا ال يقول اريد اسوي ميتين بنفس الوقت و رح الاجر، يعني صالة قرة القدم و نجيبهم كل مرة وحدة تفض يعني؟\n\n00:22:52 SPK_1\n.بس اه ياه خير ان شاء\n\n00:22:55 SPK_3\n.الله. يعني هو بس حتى أفتهم أنه هم دا يريدون هاي ال500 ال بس ما محددين إنه على كل.

اكست وباعو ال\n\n00:38:04 SPK_1\nاهه واو الحمد لله فعندكم. اه. ذ exits همينا حلو، اه. زين سؤال عن ال آه؟\n\n00:38:20 SPK_1\nال margonalise groupe؟ يعني بالمشاريع مالتكم شنو؟ إيه يعني تكوين ال الشباب والشابات اللي يجون زي have you worked with these before. ايه؟\n\n00:38:37 SPK_2\nيعني احنا بنهاية الغول مالتنا كل البروغرامز اللي احنا بدنا نسويها انو يكون. بس هاي مو دائما هي تظبط ويانا لان هي حسب مال انو المشاريع الجارية الاشخاص. فأكو يعني أكو كوهرتات، إحنا أوكي جبنا ال أو مرات أصلا في ميل أكثر، بس أغلب المرات هو إنت تشوف العدد في ميل، هو أقل إنو بالأربعينات أو بالثلاثينات، لإنه مال المشاريع هي بعدها مو؟ بس سنة على سنة بدنا نتقدم دا نشوف لأ، دا تصعد هاي ال هي كلش دا تصعد أكثر من قبل إنه هي إنه ممكن نقول إنه بال إيه؟\n\n00:39:19 SPK_2\nبالمجتمع ال community، هو صار عنده معرفة الكفاية انه بال المشاريع الناشئة، إيه همين اكو هواية انه شركات او مشا يعني تدعمهم ي يبدون يسوون مشاريع، يعني مو مثل قبل ال كلش قليلة مالتهم؟\n\n00:39:39 SPK_1\nويعني، ويا هذا السؤال يعني ينربط السؤال اللي وراها، إيه ال ال مال كابيتال بالنسبة ل إيه ما عاد تتذكرون أم واحد من ال المكونات ما حكيت بيها وايد، بس أني سميتها، فا يعني من قبل ما نجيب ناس إلى الهاكثان لو على ال مال، إيه فكر إنه الشركة ال يحتاج يكون عندهم سوشيال ميديا لو إيه؟ اي طريقة؟ آه حتى يعني يريدون يوسعون فكرة السستاني والكونستركشن وكل هذول الأشياء، وبعدين من هذا ال يقدرون يعزموا الناس، فا آه شنو ال وشلون آه تقدرون يعني يصير عندكم تواصل ويا الشباب والشباب والشبابات بالموصل يعني بدينا بالموصل بس بالعراق بشكل عام؟\n\n00:40:35 SPK_2\nآه، هو يعني إحنا بال social media هو إنه بالنهاية نتركت إحنا كل محافظة من نشر ال مالتها، إحنا إنه كل محافظة إحنا نريدها، آه مثلا إنه من إحنا سوينا عدة مشاريع بالموصل، إحنا ال يعني بوقتها مشروع طاقات جي إي من ثواني الموصل تقريبا ال2000 شخص من الموصل من المشاريع ال هم قدموا وكذلك من البصرة، يعني إحنا بالنهاية ال إحنا وين نترقدها؟ أكيد ال إنه حركات ال هاي إحنا نصل يعني\n\n00:41:12 SPK_1\nهي مو يعني مثل عندكم organic already، لو نيوز laver كبيرة، ولو اي شي يجي يعني بشكل عام يعني مو بس سورفال ميديا يعني بأي طريقة\n\n00:41:24 SPK_2\nاحنا كأورنا احنا دائما احنا نشتغل من السوشيال ميديا مالتنا دائما اكو اوير ناس كامبين على. انو همينا القطاعات واموره، هواي كلش انو ننشر، هي مجرد وا على الشغلة على متهمين الناس تستفيد اي بس لانه احنا يجوز اغلب انه ال مالتنا بغداد، فإحنا يعني بصورة عامة ك سنتركض بغداد، بس ايضا يعني همين نتركض ااه محافظات ثانيه مثلا حتى ببرنامج اورنج كورنرز اللي هو اللي احنا نسويه يعني هوايا اكو مشاركين يقدمون من الموصل عدنا، وفعلا يعني فاتو ويانا صار يمكن تلات كهرتات، احنا عندنا من الموصل انو يجون خلال ال جمعة وسبت اكو هما يكونون حاضرين بيها وبعدين يرجعون يعني؟\n\n00:42:14 SPK_1\nحلو، زين أتوقع إيه إفتهمت بشكل عام، يعني إنو مشجعين عندكم القابلية عندكم طريقة إيه؟ و إنتو تسوون كريكيوم developement، صح؟ يعني إيه؟ سويتو ال. Financial literacy module. زين وعندكم هيستري بال ريسيرش sustainability إيه؟ دأشوف انه اكو يعني طرق انه تقدرون يجوز تساعدون، إيه بال إيه تلقون شركات للشباب؟\n\n00:42:48 SPK_1\n.لمن يكملون وتعرفون هواي شركات إيه زين و what do you think يعني و. إيه؟ ليش؟ ليش نختار نشتغل مع كابتا؟ مو شركة موصل للي عندهم؟ why would it be great to work with you guys\n\n00:43:09 SPK_1\n.هذا المشروع كلش يلوقنا، لأنه نقطة، نقطة، نقطة\n\n00:43:13 SPK_3\n.أوكي إيه، وهذا السؤال يعني بصراحة يعني هي بناء على اللي همين اللي ذكرناه سابقا إنه إحنا صارلنا فترة كلش طويلة دنشتغل بالسوق من 2019، إيه؟ فهذا الشي يعني خلانا إنه إحنا مو بس إيه نسوي، يعني إيه شبكات علاقات كلش واسعة ولا من إنه بس إحنا عدنا اللي هم متوزع متنوعين ومن هواية. و إيه اشتغلنا وياهم على عدة مشاريع ويا عدة جهات، بس بنفس الوقت إنه إحنا دائما إيه بكل مشروع نفتهم بالبداية ونحاول يعني ناخذ وقتنا بالبداية حتى نفتهم. تحتاج بهذا المشروع، و نحدد البيان مالتنا، و نحدد المتدولوجي مالتنا، فإحنا يعني دائما بشغلنا نحاول ن يعني نبذل أكثر وقت اللي هي فترة ال وفترة ال لانه هو هاي الفترة اللي هي نعتبرها الاساس حتى وراها من راح نبلش بال، احنا كل شي عدنا قدامنا واضح، فهذا الشي اللي احنا نشوفه نوعا ما هي نقطة قوة بالنسبة النا، لانه اغلب المشاريع وكل المشاريع اللي احنا طبقناها، حاولنا ااه وقدرنا انه همينة دائما نحقق ال وال اللي هي موجودة ومحدديها احنا بال مالتنا\n\n00:44:33 SPK_3\nنفس الوقت انه احنا. اه ان ان بكمية ال اللي احنا عدنا اياها، وكمية ال اللي احنا
