      "content": "The Quran, the holy book of Islam, is estimated to contain approximately 77,000 words in Arabic. However, this number can vary slightly based on the method of counting and the edition of the Quran being referred to. It's important to note that the Quran is traditionally measured in verses and chapters, rather than words, with a total of 6,236 verses (ayat) in 114 chapters (suras).",
