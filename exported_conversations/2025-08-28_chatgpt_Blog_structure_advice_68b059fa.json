So, this is Bilal. I'm the co-founder of Bloom, a social enterprise support organization based out of Lebanon. We've been facing a lot of difficulties these years with sanctions and, you know, working in Palestine and Syria. Financially, some of our teams in Palestine are called PALEND, P-A-L-E-N-D. And in Syria, they're called Madad Fund, M-A-D-D-A-D-F-U-N-D. And I've been chatting with them recently, and we've been thinking about how we need to come up with different ways to do crowdfunding and crowdlending, especially as, hopefully, the Syrian situation has changed with the fall of the Assad regime and the sanctions being lifted. And in Palestine, we're in an emergency situation right now, but at the end of the war, there's going to be a lot of resources, inshallah, coming to help with reconstruction and rebuilding. And we would like to prepare the ground to be able to accept funds and distribute funds in an authenticated and trusted way to teams on the ground. And we want to sort of share that. And so, I was thinking about writing a blog as Bloom, describing my conversations with Madad Fund and PALEND. And I was wondering if you could help me organize the blog in a way that could be interesting or help me think about what would be a good direction to take this conversation. I was thinking about including Chris, who is the founder of LaunchGood, who is one of my friends. And since he has a successful crowdfunding platform already, I feel like we have some thing to build upon here. And I'm wondering both what we should do to make this structured, help with the regulations, help with trust, figure out the questions, and also to write a blog describing our journey.\", 'direction': 'in', 'decoding_id': None}",

Bringing in your experience with Bloom and looping in Chris from LaunchGood gives it a nice, practical backbone.\\n\\nIn terms of structuring the blog, I’d suggest maybe starting with a bit of context. You can paint a picture of the challenges you’ve faced with the old systems—sanctions, financial restrictions, and just the general difficulty of getting funds to where they’re needed. Then you can transition into the recent shifts—like the changes in Syria and the end of the conflict in Palestine—and how that opens a window of opportunity.\\n\\nAfter that, you could dive into the conversations you’ve had with the Medad Fund and PalLend teams. Share a little bit about their on-the-ground insights and the specific needs they’ve identified. This personalizes the story and makes it clear that this is about real people and real communities.\\n\\nAnd then you can pivot to the solution space. Talk about the idea of innovative crowdfunding and crowd-lending approaches, the importance of trust and regulation, and how you envision building a system that can handle these funds transparently. Including a mention of your connection with LaunchGood and how you’re learning from existing platforms will give readers a sense that this is both collaborative and rooted in proven models.\\n\\nIn the end, you can wrap up with a call to action—maybe inviting readers to follow along as you develop these ideas or to get in touch if they have expertise. That way, you’re not just telling a story—you’re also building a community around the effort.\\n\\nLet me know if you want me to help draft any specific sections, or if you’d like to dig into any part of that more!', 'direction': 'out', 'decoding_id': None}\n{'expiry_datetime': '2026-02-24T13:34:03.924370+00:00', 'content_type': 'audio_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'sediment://file_00000000157c61f6b8813a16636ffe00', 'size_bytes': 4399278, 'format': 'wav', 'metadata': {'start_timestamp': None, 'end_timestamp': None, 'pretokenized_vq': None, 'interruptions': None, 'original_audio_source': None, 'transcription': None, 'word_transcription': None, 'start': 0, 'end': 91.65}}",

So, in terms of examples of where things have gone wrong or where people have hit roadblocks, there are definitely a few case studies out there. For instance, a lot of smaller grassroots organizations that tried to channel funds into Syria during the height of the war ended up getting caught in international banking restrictions. Money would get frozen mid-transfer, or they’d have their accounts shut down because of compliance issues. It’s a common headache in these high-sanction environments, and it’s one reason people have had to get really creative or sometimes even give up on certain funding routes.\\n\\nAs for using the shekel in Gaza, it’s definitely a tricky subject. The shekel is essentially the default currency there, which can feel awkward for some Palestinians because it ties them economically to Israel whether they like it or not. There’s also the fact that many international donors prefer to work in dollars or euros, and converting funds back and forth can create all sorts of logistical headaches and extra fees. Plus, there’s a symbolic angle: relying on the shekel can feel like a reminder of the larger political situation, which is obviously complex.\\n\\nSo, the problem statement could really highlight those layers:', 'direction': 'out', 'decoding_id': None}\n{'expiry_datetime': '2026-02-24T13:35:41.110467+00:00', 'content_type': 'audio_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'sediment://file_000000004c8061f6b6580f1829a8a819', 'size_bytes': 2856078, 'format': 'wav', 'metadata': {'start_timestamp': None, 'end_timestamp': None, 'pretokenized_vq': None, 'interruptions': None, 'original_audio_source': None, 'transcription': None, 'word_transcription': None, 'start': 0, 'end': 59.5}}",
