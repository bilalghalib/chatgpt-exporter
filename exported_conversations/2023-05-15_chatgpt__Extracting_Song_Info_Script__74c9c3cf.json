      "content": "To achieve this, you could write a Python script that utilizes regular expressions to extract the necessary information from the text and then outputs it into a csv file. Here's an example of how you might do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport csv\n\ndef extract_song_info(text):\n    pattern = r\"'text': \\\"\\\\n(.*?) \\| (.*?) \\| (.*?) \\| (.*?) \\| (.*?) \\| (.*?) \\| (.*?) \\| (.*?)\\|(.*?)\\\"\"\n    match = re.search(pattern, text)\n    \n    if match:\n        song_name = match.group(1)\n        artist = match.group(2)\n        character_strength = match.group(3)\n        year = match.group(4)\n        genre = match.group(5)\n        style = match.group(6)  # Assuming you don't need this as per your csv column requirements\n        tags = match.group(7)  # Assuming you don't need this as per your csv column requirements\n        reasoning = match.group(8).strip()\n        youtube_url = match.group(9).strip()\n\n        return [song_name, artist, character_strength, reasoning, youtube_url, genre, year]\n\n    return []\n\ndef text_to_csv(text, output_filename):\n    song_info = extract_song_info(text)\n    if song_info:\n        with open(output_filename, 'w', newline='') as file:\n            writer = csv.writer(file)\n            writer.writerow([\"Song Name\", \"Artist\", \"Character Strength\", \"Reasoning\", \"YouTube URL\", \"Genre\", \"Year\"])\n            writer.writerow(song_info)\n    else:\n        print(\"No song information found in the provided text.\")\n\ntext = \"\"\"...\"\"\"  # Your text here\n\ntext_to_csv(text, \"songs.csv\")\n```\n\nPlease replace `\"\"\"...\"\"\"` with your actual text. You can run this script and it will generate a file called \"songs.csv\" in the same directory with the extracted information.\n\nDo note, this script makes some assumptions about the format of the text provided, and it will not work if the format changes. If the format can vary, you would need a more robust solution.",
