Steps to follow: 1. Identify the key aspects or dimensions of the question that need to be addressed at each level (e.g., product/service definition, value proposition clarity, alignment with mission and goals). 2. Determine the progression of maturity or sophistication for each aspect, from the most basic or initial stage to the most advanced or mature stage. 3. Develop a clear and concise statement for each level that describes the characteristic features or milestones expected at that stage, considering the key aspects identified in step 1. 4. Ensure that each level builds upon the previous one, showing a logical progression of maturity or sophistication. 5. Incorporate tangible examples, such as specific documents or evidence, that would support an organization's self-assessment at each level. 6. Use clear and consistent language throughout the levels, avoiding jargon or ambiguous terms. 7. Aim for a balanced distribution of levels, ensuring that there are sufficient intermediate stages between the most basic and most advanced levels. 8. Validate the relevance and appropriateness of each level statement by considering real-world examples or case studies of social enterprises at various stages of development. 9. Refine the wording and structure of each level statement to ensure clarity, conciseness, and ease of understanding for the intended audience (i.e., social entrepreneurs). 10. Review the final set of level statements to ensure they collectively provide a comprehensive and coherent framework for assessing an organization's maturity or sophistication in relation to the initial question. Principles: 1. Clarity: The level statements should be clear, concise, and easy to understand, avoiding ambiguity or vagueness. 2. Relevance: Each level statement should be relevant and applicable to the specific context of social entrepreneurship and the question being addressed. 3. Progression: The levels should demonstrate a logical and coherent progression of maturity or sophistication, with each level building upon the previous one. 4. Evidence-based: The level statements should incorporate tangible examples or evidence that organizations can use to support their self-assessment. 5. Comprehensiveness: The set of level statements should cover all key aspects or dimensions of the question, providing a comprehensive framework for assessment. 6. Objectivity: The level statements should be objective and free from bias, allowing for a fair and accurate self-assessment by social entrepreneurs. 7. Actionable: The level statements should provide clear guidance and direction for organizations looking to improve their maturity or sophistication in relation to the question being addressed. 8. Flexibility: The level statements should be flexible enough to accommodate the diverse range of social enterprises and their unique contexts and challenges. 9. Continuous improvement: The framework should encourage continuous learning, reflection, and improvement, recognizing that social entrepreneurship is an ongoing journey of development and growth. 10. Collaboration: The development of the level statements should involve input and feedback from relevant stakeholders, including social entrepreneurs, experts, and practitioners, to ensure their relevance and usefulness.\n\nThe levels:\n**1a.
