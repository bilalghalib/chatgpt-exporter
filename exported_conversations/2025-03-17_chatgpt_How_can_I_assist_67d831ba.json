The conversation has some greeting or content about the user’s bio—no clear query came after that. The instructions mention something about creating charts, but without a concrete request, I'm not really sure what to focus on. Hmm, maybe the best approach here is just to ask: \"Hi, how can I help?\" Since there’s no other clear instruction, this seems like the safest route.",
