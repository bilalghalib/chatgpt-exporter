      "content": "For a UN job, the level of the position would likely be **P4** or **P5**, depending on the complexity of the role, the degree of responsibility, and the geographic or thematic scope of the program.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n### **P4 Level**\n- **Typical Role**: Middle to senior-level specialist or program manager with substantive expertise.\n- **Experience Requirement**: Around 7-10 years of relevant professional experience.\n- **Responsibilities**: Focused on designing, managing, and evaluating programs, with some leadership responsibilities for small teams. Often more specialized in a particular technical or thematic area.\n- **Relevance to Your Criteria**:\n  - Curriculum development, training program design, and focus group discussions align well.\n  - The emphasis on stakeholder engagement and monitoring frameworks fits a P4 level.\n\n### **P5 Level**\n- **Typical Role**: Senior leadership or highly specialized technical expert.\n- **Experience Requirement**: 10-15 years of professional experience, with significant leadership or program oversight responsibilities.\n- **Responsibilities**: Overseeing large-scale, multi-country programs or high-stakes initiatives, managing multiple teams, and liaising with high-level stakeholders.\n- **Relevance to Your Criteria**:\n  - If the role involves strategic oversight of multiple programs or partnerships across regions (e.g., Ninewa and beyond), it could justify a P5 designation.\n  - The requirement for significant collaboration with implementing partners and validation mechanisms could tilt it toward P5, particularly if the program has a wide-reaching impact.\n\n### **Key Factors for Determination**:\n1. **Scope of Responsibility**: If the role involves national-level program oversight (Ninewa or Iraq-focused) with some autonomy, P4 is likely. For regional or cross-border responsibilities, P5 becomes more plausible.\n2. **Management and Leadership**: If the position includes managing large teams, high-stakes decision-making, and significant partner or donor engagement, it leans toward P5.\n3. **Contextual Expertise**: If deep expertise in the region or subject matter is paramount, and the role serves as a primary decision-making authority, P5 is justified.\n\nIf you want a more precise assessment, providing details on the reporting structure, team size, or scope of impact could refine the answer further.",
