      "content": "FIVE ONE LABS: CLIMATE-RESILIENT CURRICULUM UPDATE PROCESS\nI. Introduction & Key Principles\nEmbedded, Not Added\nWe frame climate resilience as business resilience—an essential aspect of modern entrepreneurship in Iraq/KRI. It is not an extra environmental step but rather a core risk management and business efficiency measure.\n\nReal-World Examples\nUse case studies highlighting Iraqi/KRI businesses that have adapted to local climate challenges (e.g., energy costs, water scarcity). This makes sustainability relevant and actionable for participants.\n\nFlexibility & Feasibility\nIntroduce staged adaptation strategies: small, cost-effective changes now, a roadmap for scaling over time.\n\nRisk Management as Core Business Skill\nMonitor environmental and economic risks, adjusting the model accordingly. This is especially relevant in contexts like the KRI with inconsistent electricity and potential water shortages.\n\nILO Green Business Booklet & GreenComp\nWe reference:\n\nILO Green Business Booklet (for greening processes, supply chain, and product design).\nGreenComp (European Sustainability Competence Framework) for soft skills like systems thinking and futures literacy.\nBusiness Efficiency Workbook (BEW)\nThe BEW is a central living document used throughout the program. At key points, participants fill in resource use, potential climate risks, and adaptation actions. We add or modify worksheets only if needed.\n\nII. The Four-Stage Process\nWe have fewer (4) major stages, each with a single, detailed prompt to run in an LLM. That yields a Module Update Report and a Scoring & Integration Tracker.\n\nStage 1: Summarize & Identify Existing Climate Links\nObjective: Understand the module’s content, goals, and any implicit references to sustainability or resource efficiency.\n\nPrompt (Paste your raw slides/content at the end):\n\nmarkdown\nCopy\nEdit\n[ROLE: You are a curriculum consultant integrating climate resilience into entrepreneurship training.]\n\n1. **Summarize the Module**:\n   - Provide a short (2–3 sentence) summary of the module’s main objectives, topics, and flow.\n\n2. **Identify Existing Sustainability or Efficiency Elements**:\n   - Note any references (even indirect) to resource use, risk management, or “green” topics.\n   - Mention potential local Iraqi/KRI contexts (e.g., water scarcity, rising energy costs).\n\n3. **Pinpoint Natural Integration Opportunities**:\n   - Where could we easily mention climate resilience without disrupting the lesson flow?\n   - Which sections or slides are best for referencing the Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW)?\n\nLLM Output: A short list of relevant existing references plus some “low-hanging fruit” for improvement.\n\n\n[[[#\nIGNITE\nA 2 WEEK-LONG\nENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAM\nAgenda\n\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Introduction to Five One Labs and Ignite\n10:05 | Break\n10:20 | “Yes, and…” icebreaker \n10:35 | Design thinking overview\n10:50 | Design Sprint\n11:55 - 12:00 | Wrap up\n----\n\n9:00 | Settle in\nPeople arrive\nMingle \nOffer people cookies, fruit, tea, coffee, etc…\nAnswer questions \n\n9:15 | Day’s Intro + Welcome\nIntroduce yourself and welcome everyone!\nWelcome everyone, we are so happy you can join us today for the first day of Ignite! Today is all about getting to know each other, understanding the program, and setting the foundations for the next two weeks as you learn more about the market and your customers needs!\n1\n\n\n\nLET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER\u000b\n Name?\n Where you are from?\n Tell us your idea.\n What’s your superpower?\n10 minutes: Share\n\nIntroductions:\nBefore we get started, I would like to introduce myself and get to know all of you a bit better. Let's quickly go around the room and share:\nYour name,\nWhere you are from,\nTell us a little bit about your idea. \nAnd finally, if you had a superpower, what would it be (flying, reading minds, shape shifting, etc…)?\n\nThe trainers should start first. Then, go around the room so each person can introduce themselves.\n2\n\n09:00 am \t\tWelcome + Introductions!\n09:30 am\t\tFive One Labs & Ignite\n10:30 am\t\tDesign Sprint \n12:00 pm\t\tGroup Lunch\n01:30 pm\t\tUser Research \n04:30 pm\t\tWrap up\nAGENDA\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nAgenda: Now that we all know each other a little better, let’s get into the agenda for the day. \nThis morning we will spend some time understanding Five One Labs, the program, and what exactly you will be doing over the two weeks. This will be an opportunity to clarify any questions you still have and give you some insights on what is in store ahead through a design sprint!\nGroup Lunch: At 12:00 we will take a break and get lunch together. \nThis afternoon we will come back and get into user research. This is the first major session we will have. Here we will define our research plan for the next few weeks! Tell us a little bit about your idea, what problem does it solve? Finally, we will wrap up around 4:30!\n\n3\n\nYES, AND….\n15 minutes: Icebreaker \n\n2 minutes: Explain the activity\nTrainers should conduct the “YES, AND…” Icebreaker\nMake teams of about 3-5\nState a problem or ask the group for a problem \nFor example:\nIt’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nIt is so hot outside, how can I get to and from work without sweating or ever feeling the heat?\n \n5 minutes: “No” technique:\nYou have 2 minutes to generate different crazy ideas to solve that problem. Generate as many as possible. But there is a rule! When one member in the team says an idea another one must say “no!” and come up with a completely different idea. This goes on and on until the 2 minutes are up. You have to do this quickly, let's see how many crazy ideas we will get.\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nUse an umbrella!\nNo! Build a tunnel to go directly inside!\nNo! make a waterproof suit that covers your whole body!\nNo! Build an overpass that my taxi/bus will drop me off under!\nNo! Have a drone float above my head to prevent water from touching me.\nNo!.....\n[2 minutes pass] Time is done!\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with.\n \n5 minutes: Now let’s try “yes and”: \nYou have 2 minutes again, and this time someone says an idea, and then someone else in the group must say “yes”, and add a feature to grow the idea to make the idea bigger. Is it clear? Let's do it\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nBuild a tunnel to go directly inside from where you get dropped off!\nYes! And have heat inside to keep you warm on cold days\nYes! And the heat system is controlled by an app on your phone that you can use to control the temperature where you are walking\nYes! And …..\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with\n\n3 minutes: Review + recap\nAsk them which one did they like and why? (yes and or no method)\nThen explain “yes and” is good because it’s positive, and it feels good when your friends agree with your idea, right? And you can build on top of it to create really good and complete ideas. You can go deeper and come up with things that you normally wouldn’t have discovered.\n“No” is also good, as it generates a wide variety of ideas. And in real life when you talk about your idea to someone not everybody is positive and will like your idea. Sometimes you have to say no!\n\nRecap: As a rule at Five One Labs, we try to use the “yes and” method. We want to build off and support each other.\n\n4\n\nDesign Sprint!\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\nOk great! I hope you had some fun and got to know the people sitting around you a little bit more. \nWe are now going to get into the first design thinking session of Ignite, the Design Sprint! We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources. But first, we will give you a little introduction to the Design curriculum and an overview of the design thinking methodology.\n5\n\n\nFeb. 2, 2020:\t\t      Introduction to Design Thinking\nFeb. 2, 2020:\t\t      User Research\nFeb. 16, 2020:\t      Define the Problem\nFeb. 20, 2020:\t\tCreativity and Ideation\n \n \n\nDESIGN THINKING SCHEDULE\nApril 1\nIntro to design thinking\nApril 1\nApril 7\nApril 8\nUser research\nDefine the problem\nCreativity and ideation\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nQuickly give an overview of the 4 Design sessions they will have over the next two weeks. \nIntroduction to Design Thinking: We will focus on giving you a good understanding of design thinking and the human centered design process today through a design sprint. Starting this afternoon, we will talk about applying the Design Thinking methodology to your business.\nUser Research: We will go into creating a research plan for you to deeply understand your customers and their needs.\nReframe: Define the Problem: We will take all of our research, and clearly define the problem for your different customer types.\nCreativity and Ideation: Finally, we will generate solutions to your customers problems. Some of them might be your current ideas, but we hope to generate a wide variety of ideas that could all be potential solutions. \n6\n\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What is design thinking?

(gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc… \n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap \nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc… \nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses. \nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved? \n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things? \n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs \nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box. \nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!! (alone)\n Offer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\n Send the entrepreneurs in the other room where prototyping supplies are laid out for them.\n How might this solution fit into the context of your partner’s life? \n Improve and build out the concept you talked about\n17\n\nFEEDBACK\n20 minutes: Activity\n\n6 minutes: Feedback (3 mins each) \nRemember, your idea is not precious, feedback is just a way to learn more\nGenerate more feedback\nWrite down how they feel about it\nWatch how they use it, misuse it, what mistakes are they making, what doesn’t make sense, etc\nWrite down one new idea, one big question from feedback. Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\n \n10 minutes: Debrief \nHow did discussing and gathering feedback from the person change how your final solution looks?\nIf you had to make it for yourself, would it look the same as it did for your partner?\nWho ended up with something their partner really liked? Why? What about it stood out? \nWhat would you change in your next iteration?\nWhat part was most uncomfortable? What was most natural? \nHow was it as a user interacting with the prototype? \n\n18\n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nBriefly explain again how they just went through the whole design thinking process in under an hour\nExplain that during Ignite, we will go through the first 3 steps, and then the incubator we will do the last 2 steps\nWrap up for lunch\n\n19\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nAny Questions?]]]",

      "content": "Here's the **Module Update Report** for integrating climate resilience into the **Five One Labs: Ignite Entrepreneurship Program** based on the **Stage 1 Analysis**.\n\n---\n\n## **Module Update Report: Climate-Resilient Curriculum Integration**\n\n### **Module Summary**\nThe **Ignite Entrepreneurship Program** is a **two-week-long** intensive designed to help participants develop entrepreneurial skills through interactive activities like **design sprints, user research, brainstorming, and prototyping**. The curriculum emphasizes **design thinking, problem-solving, and iteration**, encouraging participants to build sustainable business ideas.\n\n### **Existing Sustainability & Efficiency Elements**\nWhile the module does not explicitly mention **climate resilience**, several **existing themes** align with **business efficiency** and **resource-conscious design**:\n1. **Design Thinking & Iteration** – The curriculum encourages creative solutions and iterative testing, making it easy to embed **resource-conscious approaches** (e.g., considering low-cost, sustainable materials).\n2. **Prototyping with Local & Recycled Materials** – The **Build Phase** already includes **resource awareness** by using local, recycled, and green materials.\n3. **Risk Management through User Research** – Understanding **customer pain points** can naturally extend to include climate-related risks (e.g., energy costs, supply chain vulnerabilities).\n4. **Problem Definition as a Verb** – The approach of **defining needs as verbs** instead of nouns naturally opens room for **sustainable, systemic solutions** (e.g., “we need to reduce energy waste” instead of “we need more electricity”).\n5. **Creativity Constraints** – The curriculum asks participants to **brainstorm solutions under specific constraints**, such as using **local or recycled materials**, which aligns with climate-conscious innovation.\n\n### **Natural Integration Opportunities**\nSeveral sections provide **low-hanging fruit** for embedding **climate resilience** without disrupting the lesson flow:\n1. **Yes, And Icebreaker (10:35 AM)**\n   - Adapt the problem scenarios to include **climate-related challenges** (e.g., “How can we stay cool without using more electricity?”).\n   - Encourages **climate resilience as a business challenge**, not an add-on.\n   \n2. **Design Sprint (10:50 AM)**\n   - When framing the **problem-solving exercise**, introduce **climate-conscious constraints** (e.g., cost-efficient, energy-saving, or circular economy approaches).\n   - Example: Instead of a generic **morning routine challenge**, use:\n     - “How can we design an efficient morning routine that saves water, energy, or waste?”\n   \n3. **User Research (1:30 PM)**\n   - Include prompts about **environmental and energy-related business risks** when discussing **customer needs**.\n   - Encourage questions about **supply chain risks, energy costs, and climate-related market shifts**.\n   \n4. **Prototyping & Material Use (BUILD Phase)**\n   - Strengthen the focus on **sustainable prototyping materials**.\n   - Add a **BEW checkpoint** where participants **document materials used and explore greener alternatives**.\n   \n5. **Feedback & Iteration (FEEDBACK Phase)**\n   - Include a reflection question: **“Could this solution work with fewer resources or less waste?”**.\n   - Connect to risk management: “How would climate shocks affect this business model?”\n\n### **Next Steps**\nFor **Stage 2**, we will refine **specific updates** and provide **climate-aligned worksheets** in the **Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW)**. Let me know if you want to adjust the level of integration or focus! 🚀",
