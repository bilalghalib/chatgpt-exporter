      "content": "Got you, Bilal. Short answer first:\n\n**TL;DR — Don’t sign this as-is.** It’s very client-leaning on IP, liability, non-compete, payments, and jurisdiction. If you can’t get key redlines (below), I’d walk.\n\n---\n\n## Pros (a few)\n- Mutual confidentiality (with an option for you to designate your own confidential info).\n- Independent-contractor status stated.\n- Consequential damages excluded (but see “no cap” under cons).\n- Force-majeure exists (though short).\n\n## Big cons / red flags (what to pay attention to)\n1. **IP grab (7.1–7.4 + 1.1(a)):**  \n   “Works made for hire,” full assignment *and* waiver of moral rights, **covering basically everything** (curriculum, pedagogy, tech, code, architecture, databases, recorded sessions, etc.). You’re also barred from reusing “Works” (7.3). This conflicts with your model of reusable frameworks/templates and your Baraka/Come-Alive/Parliaments IP.\n2. **Use of your name & image (7.2):**  \n   “Unfettered rights” to use your name/photos and to commercially exploit derivatives. Zero consent/approval rights.\n3. **Non-compete (9.10):**  \n   Blanket ban on engaging with *their clients* during the term + **2 years after**, with a fixed INR 5,00,000 penalty. (Post-term non-competes are often challengeable in India, but you don’t want to rely on that; the penalty is still a risk.)\n4. **Indemnity is one-way and huge (8.1–8.3):**  \n   You indemnify for almost everything (incl. **delays** and 3P IP claims), reimburse within 15 days, and “after-tax” gross-up. No reciprocal indemnity for their materials/instructions.\n5. **No liability cap:**  \n   Consequential damages are excluded, but there’s **no cap on direct damages** or on your indemnity. That’s untenable.\n6. **Termination asymmetry (9.2–9.6):**  \n   They can terminate for convenience with 15 days. You **can’t** terminate until completion (except narrow cases) and elsewhere it says “2 months for reason.” That’s internally inconsistent and unfavorable.\n7. **Payment & acceptance leverage (3–4 & SoW 3–4):**  \n   MSA says Net-45; SoW says Net-30 (SoW may prevail, but it’s inconsistent). Acceptance is at each stage and can stall your invoicing; penalties of **2.5%** of project cost for delay (SoW 4.d) + general “time is of the essence” liability.\n8. **Jurisdiction & seat:**  \n   **Indian law, Mumbai seat/arbitration, Mumbai courts for interim relief.** Expensive for you to contest and enforce.\n9. **“Prohibited Materials” (7.1):**  \n   You can’t include your standard libraries, templates or third-party content without prior permission, and if you do, they still get a perpetual license tied to the deliverable.\n10. **Operational overreach (1.6 & site rules):**  \n    No substitution of “Key Personnel” without their right to terminate; on-premise rules (badges, etc.) even if you’re remote.\n11. **Taxes:**  \n    Withholding/TDS risk, GST references, debit notes if you “fail to file,” and no clear DTAA treatment or gross-up protection for non-resident status.\n\n## What you might take offense to (tone & posture)\n- “Unfettered rights” to your work **and** to your name/photo (7.2).  \n- The scope of “Deliverables” naming **your pedagogy, tech, and code** as theirs.  \n- A **blanket two-year non-compete** + preset monetary penalty.  \n- One-way indemnity and “reimburse in 15 days” with gross-up.  \n- “Service Provider shall not… create derivative works” of what *you* made (7.3).  \n- Immediate termination if you change Key Personnel (1.6(e)).  \n- Mumbai-only law, courts, and arbitration for a global, remote engagement.\n\n---\n\n## Minimum redlines to ask for (prioritize these)\n1. **IP / Background IP carve-outs**  \n   - Define **Background IP** / **Existing Materials** broadly (methods, frameworks, templates, code, tools, know-how).  \n   - Deliverables = **course-specific content** specified in the SoW (not platform design, generic pedagogy, code, databases).  \n   - Replace “work made for hire + assignment” with: **non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide license** to Client **for the Deliverables only**, with no right for Client to claim ownership of your Background IP.  \n   - Add **Residuals clause** (you can use general know-how learned).  \n   - Remove/limit 7.3 so you can reuse your own materials in other contexts.\n2. **Name & image (7.2):**  \n   Change to **marketing use only with your prior written consent**, non-disparaging, no implication of endorsement.\n3. **Non-compete (9.10):**  \n   Strike it. If they insist, convert to **non-solicit** of *named* Client accounts you directly work with, **12 months max**, no liquidated damages (or a modest, reasonable cap).\n4. **Indemnity & liability:**  \n   - Limit your indemnity to **(a)** third-party IP infringement of Deliverables (excluding Client-provided materials/instructions), and **(b)** your **gross negligence or willful misconduct**.  \n   - Add **Client indemnity** for Client materials/instructions.  \n   - **Cap all liability** (including indemnity) at **fees paid under the applicable SoW** (or 12-month fees).  \n   - Remove “after-tax gross-up” and the 15-day reimbursement clock.\n5. **Termination & convenience:**  \n   - Mutual **30-day convenience termination**; if Client terminates, they pay for work done **+ non-cancellable committed costs**.  \n   - Clean up 9.2 vs 9.3 conflict; allow you to terminate for non-payment (≥15–30 days overdue), material scope change, or material breach (with cure).\n6. **Acceptance & payments:**  \n   - **Deemed acceptance**: X business days after delivery if no written, specific rejection.  \n   - **Milestones** with **Net-15/30** and **late-fee/interest**.  \n   - Remove/limit the **2.5% penalty**; if they insist, apply only after a cure period and **cap total penalties** (e.g., 10% of SoW fees).\n7. **Jurisdiction / seat:**  \n   - Move to a neutral forum (e.g., **SIAC in Singapore** / **ICC in Paris**; remote hearings). If they won’t, at least allow remote proceedings and split venue/seat (neutral seat, virtual hearings).\n8. **Taxes:**  \n   - State fees are **exclusive of taxes**; Client will **provide TDS certificates** promptly; apply **DTAA** if you’re non-resident; no GST obligations if you don’t have an Indian GST registration. No debit notes for taxes that don’t apply to you.\n9. **Personnel & subcontracting:**  \n   - Allow substitution with **equivalently qualified** personnel on notice; reasonable consent not to be unreasonably withheld.  \n   - Clarify you may use **specialist subcontractors**; you remain responsible.\n10. **Third-party/FOSS & your templates:**  \n    - Permit inclusion under their standard licenses; Client accepts those license terms.\n11. **Publicity (mutual):**  \n    - You can list Client name/logo as a portfolio item **with consent**; they can do likewise.\n12. **Remote-first ops:**  \n    - Remove on-premise badge rules unless you’re actually onsite.\n\n---\n\n## Should you sign?\n- **As-is: No.** It jeopardizes your reusable IP, restricts your future work, and exposes you to uncapped risk in a foreign venue.  \n- **Signable if they accept the core edits** (IP carve-out + license, liability cap, kill/soften non-compete, fair termination, clear acceptance/payments, neutral/remote dispute forum). If they only tweak cosmetics, it’s still a no.\n\n---\n\n## Quick redline snippets (drop-in language)\n- **Background IP:**  \n  “*‘Background IP’ means any methods, methodologies, frameworks, templates, tools, software (including source code), data models, know-how, inventions, and other materials developed or owned by Service Provider independently of this Agreement or outside the scope of a SoW, together with any improvements thereto.*”\n- **License instead of assignment:**  \n  “*Service Provider retains all right, title and interest in Background IP. For Deliverables created specifically for Client under an applicable SoW, Service Provider grants Client a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, display, distribute, and create derivative works of such Deliverables solely for Client’s internal and external program needs. No assignment of Background IP is made or implied.*”\n- **Residuals:**  \n  “*Nothing restricts Service Provider’s use of ideas, know-how, and techniques retained in unaided memory.*”\n- **Liability cap:**  \n  “*Each party’s aggregate liability arising out of or related to a SoW shall not exceed the fees paid or payable under that SoW. Excludes liability that cannot be limited by law.*”\n- **Indemnity (narrow):**  \n  “*Service Provider indemnifies Client against third-party claims alleging Deliverables infringe IP, excluding claims arising from Client materials/instructions or combinations not supplied by Service Provider. Client indemnifies Service Provider for claims arising from Client materials/instructions.*”\n- **Non-solicit (if needed):**  \n  “*For 12 months post-engagement, Service Provider will not knowingly solicit paid work from the specific Client accounts listed in the SoW to which Service Provider was introduced by Client, excluding (i) inbound requests, (ii) pre-existing relationships, and (iii) general market outreach not targeted at such accounts.*”\n- **Deemed acceptance:**  \n  “*Deliverables are deemed accepted if Client does not provide written, specific rejection within 7 business days of delivery.*”\n- **Payments:**  \n  “*Milestone invoices Net-30; interest on late payments at 1.0% per month (or max lawful). Client shall not withhold undisputed amounts.*”\n- **Disputes:**  \n  “*Any disputes shall be finally resolved by arbitration seated in Singapore under SIAC Rules, conducted remotely in English.*”\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a one-page checklist you can send back with your redlines, or draft a clean SoW that **overrides** the MSA on IP/acceptance/payment (use their own §11.5 precedence to your advantage).",

Here’s a quick map in **one-sentence each** for the “other issues” besides IP, so you know what they want vs. what you should ask for:  \n\n- **IP ownership:** They want *everything you produce, including methods/frameworks, forever.* → You should ask for *they own the specific deliverables, you retain your background IP and give them a broad license.*  \n- **Non-compete:** They want *to block you from working with any of their clients for 2 years + fine.* → You should ask for *no non-compete, at most a short non-solicit of named accounts.*  \n- **Indemnity:** They want *you to cover them for almost anything.* → You should ask for *mutual indemnity, limited to IP infringement and gross negligence.*  \n- **Liability:** They want *unlimited direct liability.* → You should ask for *liability capped at fees paid under each SoW.*  \n- **Payment/acceptance:** They want *net-45, acceptance only when they sign off, and penalties for your delay.* → You should ask for *net-30, deemed acceptance after 7 days, capped penalties.*  \n- **Termination:** They want *to terminate on 15 days’ notice, you basically can’t.* → You should ask for *mutual 30-day termination for convenience.*  \n- **Jurisdiction:** They want *Mumbai only.* → You can accept, but ask for *virtual hearings/arbitration so it’s not a burden.*  \n\n---\n\n### Draft Email (friendly, minimal-maximal changes)\n\nSubject: A few clarifications on the services agreement  \n\nHi [Name],  \n\nThanks for sharing the Master Services Agreement — I really appreciate how thorough it is. I get the sense it’s a standard template you use across consultants, and I’d love to align it with how I normally work so that it’s practical for both of us.  \n\nThere are just a few areas I’d like to clarify or tweak:  \n\n1. **Intellectual Property:** Since I bring a lot of existing methods and frameworks into my work, I’d like to keep ownership of my “background IP” (my tools, approaches, templates, etc.). Of course, you’d own the specific deliverables I create for you, and I’d grant you a broad, perpetual license to use them however you need. That way you get full rights to what you pay for, and I can continue improving my practice.  \n\n2. **Non-compete:** The current wording blocks me from working with your clients for two years, which is quite restrictive. I’d suggest instead a short, limited non-solicit of named accounts I’m introduced to solely through this project.  \n\n3. **Indemnity & Liability:** I’d like to make indemnities mutual and focused on things that really matter (IP infringement or gross negligence), and to cap liability at the fees paid under the SoW. That way neither of us takes on unlimited exposure.  \n\n4. **Payment & Acceptance:** Could we set payments to Net-30, with a clear review window (e.g. deemed acceptance if no comments within 7 days)? That keeps cash flow predictable while still giving you a fair chance to review.  \n\n5. **Termination:** It would feel more balanced if either party could terminate on 30 days’ notice, with payment for work completed.  \n\nEverything else I’m fine with, including Mumbai jurisdiction — I’d just appreciate if hearings can be conducted virtually to save costs and time.  \n\nI’ve attached a short rider that covers these points clearly, so we don’t have to edit your whole document line-by-line. Let me know if that works for you — I imagine most of these are standard adjustments for independent consultants.  \n\nLooking forward to working together,  \nBilal  \n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to also draft the **attached Rider** in a super short, one-page version (just the 5 points above), so it’s easy for them to accept without sending it to lawyers?",

You’d own the specific deliverables I create for you, with full rights to use them. If I develop something new that could be useful elsewhere, we can just discuss permissions so it feels fair.  \n- **Non-compete:** Instead of a broad restriction, I suggest a simple non-solicit of specific accounts I meet only through this project.  \n- **Payments:** Could we do Net-30, with deliverables deemed accepted after 7 days unless there’s written feedback?  \n\nEverything else looks fine to me, including termination at 15 days and Mumbai jurisdiction.  \n\nI think these tweaks keep things practical while giving you full use of the work.

      "content": "This “Vendor Registration Form” looks much less risky than the MSA — it’s basically an **administrative document** so they can put you in their payment system.  \n\nHere’s how I’d break it down for you:  \n\n---\n\n### What it is\n- Standard onboarding form: collects **contact info, tax IDs, and bank details** so they can pay you via NEFT/RTGS.  \n- Includes a self-certification that your info is correct and that you’ll comply with their code of conduct (likely standard corporate ethics).  \n\n### Pros\n- Streamlines payments — avoids “lost invoices.”  \n- No transfer of rights or restrictions beyond basic compliance.  \n- Straightforward: just fill and attach PAN/GST/etc.  \n\n### Cons / Watch-outs\n- **Tax IDs:** If you don’t have certain numbers (TIN, VAT, CST, Service Tax — many are obsolete under GST), just leave blank or write “Not applicable.”  \n- **MSME status:** If you’re registered as a Micro/Small/Medium Enterprise, you may get faster payment terms under Indian law — if not, leave blank.  \n- **Bank info:** They’ll have your account details — only risk is normal data handling (make sure it’s their official email/portal).  \n- **Declaration:** It references “William Penn Pvt Ltd Code of Conduct” — odd since the MSA is with “Text and Clicks.” Worth confirming it’s not just a copy-paste artifact.  \n\n---\n\n👉 Minimal response email you could send:  \n\n**Subject:** Vendor Registration Form – Clarification  \n\nHi [Name],  \n\nThanks for sending the vendor registration form. I’ll be happy to fill it in — just to confirm: some of the tax fields (TIN, VAT, CST, Service Tax) aren’t applicable under GST anymore, so I’ll leave those blank. Also, I noticed the declaration references *William Penn Pvt Ltd* — should that be updated to *Text and Clicks*?  \n\nBest,  \nBilal  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to **fill a clean template version** for you with “Not applicable” in the outdated sections, so you just have to drop in your PAN, bank, and GST (if you have one)?",

      "content": "what does this non solicit part mean? Thanks Nilam and Thanks Monica!\n\nI just completed my last contract with the UN and have had the time to sit with the contract for a bit. I'm excited to see Aman Zaidi on the team, he seems lovely. \n\nWhile looking over the contract, I imagine this is your standard template, and overall, it looks good to me. I just wanted to clarify a few small points so we can be aligned and so things flow  smoothly:\n\n•⁠  ⁠IP: I’d love to keep ownership of my my prior work methods and templates. Of course, all the specific deliverables I create for you would be fully yours to use. If anything new emerges during the process that could be useful more broadly, we can just check in and make sure it feels fair on both sides. \n•⁠  ⁠Non-compete: Instead of a wide restriction, perhaps we can simplify it to a basic non-solicit. \n•⁠  ⁠Payments: Would it be possible to set it as Net-30, with deliverables automatically considered accepted after 7 days unless there’s written feedback?\n\nEverything else reads well to me, including the 15-day termination clause and Mumbai jurisdiction.\n\nI think these small tweaks keep things practical and respectful for both of us, while giving you full use of the work.

Through Bloom, he has helped more than a thousand emerging leaders and entrepreneurs across the Middle East and Africa.\n\nQuick story: Bilal had a session called “Facilitator Toolbox” where he guided leaders and teachers through simple pedagogy moves (check-ins, reflection prompts, learning by doing), then layered in AI collaboration methods like SCRIBER and RACE, so participants could immediately apply LLM to real tasks during the workshop.\n\nTwo ways he can add value right away:\n\nLead engaging Arabic and English sessions for executives and educators that blend solid pedagogy with practical GenAI, with clear frameworks, hands-on activities, and live demos that make adoption stick.\nProvide supporting materials, including concise handbooks and facilitator guides in both languages, so your client can keep momentum after the sessions.\nBilal is currently collaborating with the UN International Trade Centre on curriculum design work in Iraq, so he is comfortable tailoring content for Middle East stakeholders and turning it into implementable toolkits. \n\nHe is based in France and travels for work, working smoothly across multiple time zones.\n\nI believe his background aligns closely with what you’re looking for. I’m attaching Bilal's CV for easy review, and here’s his LinkedIn profile. If this sounds like a good fit, Bilal would be happy to jump on a quick call to learn more.\n\n \n\nWarmly,\nNilam\n(on behalf of Bilal Ghalib)\nbilal@bloom.pm / bg@bilalghalib.com | +1 (478) 227-2253 i don't understand",

      "content": "Good question — and your instinct to pause on the “non-solicit” bit is right.  \nHere’s what it actually means in **plain English**, and how it relates to your concern about building things in your off time 👇  \n\n---\n\n### 🧭 What “non-solicit” means\nA **non-solicitation clause** is a softer, narrower version of a **non-compete**.  \nInstead of banning you from working for others, it just says:\n\n> “For X months after our contract ends, you won’t *actively approach* our clients or employees to offer them your own services.”\n\nSo:\n- You **can** keep working with your own network, other clients, or totally new partners.  \n- You **can** still accept work **if one of their clients contacts you first** (you just can’t *chase* them).  \n- It usually applies only to **named accounts** or relationships you met *through them*.\n\n---\n\n### 🧱 Example\nLet’s say Text & Clicks hires you to teach for a client like “ABC University.”\n\nIf your contract says a **non-solicit**, it means:\n- You can’t reach out to ABC University and say “Hire me directly next time.”  \n- But if ABC University later emails you independently and says “Hey Bilal, we loved your session — can you do a workshop for us?” you can **accept**, because *they* initiated it.\n\n---\n\n### ⚖️ Why it’s reasonable\nThis protects them from you cutting them out of their own deals — which is fair —  \nbut it doesn’t block you from creating or freelancing elsewhere, nor from building your own intellectual property.  \n\n---\n\n### 💡 How to keep yourself safe\nAsk them to make it **explicit** that:\n> “The non-solicit applies only to specific clients introduced to me through this engagement, and not to my general professional or creative work.”\n\nThat one line solves your “how will they know what I build in my off time?” worry —  \nbecause your off-time projects, templates, or other clients stay **completely yours and outside their scope**.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can slightly polish your draft email so it naturally includes that clarification in one short sentence —  \nwithout sounding defensive or legalistic. Would you like me to do that?",

      "content": "You’re right to pause and check this — let’s unpack it simply:  \n\n### 💰 What the contract currently says about payment\nIn the **MSA**, the key payment clauses are:\n\n- **4.1–4.2**: You invoice after deliverables are accepted in writing.  \n  Client pays within **45 days** from receiving your invoice.  \n- **SoW section 4(b)** says **payment will be cleared within 30 days** of invoicing.  \n- They can withhold payment for *disputed* services or if acceptance hasn’t happened.  \n- There’s **no late-payment interest** and no “automatic acceptance” clause.  \n\nSo, in practice:\n- If they *delay reviewing* your deliverables, your invoice clock doesn’t even start yet.  \n- And even once it starts, they technically have up to **45 days** to pay (depending which clause wins).  \n- There’s no consequence if they pay late.\n\nThat means the “it seems ok” is only true **if they’re quick and organized** — but legally, it gives them a lot of slack and gives you none.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Why your ask (Net-30 + 7-day automatic acceptance) is smart\nYou’re not asking for extra money — just:\n1. **Net-30** → industry-standard; faster cashflow; aligns with SoW text.  \n2. **7-day deemed acceptance** → stops deliverables from getting “stuck” in review limbo.  \n\nTogether they simply make sure:\n- You get paid in ~5 weeks instead of 2–3 months.  \n- Payment isn’t hostage to slow feedback.  \n\nIt’s a *practical safeguard*, not a power move — so it’s worth keeping in your email exactly as you wrote it.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can slightly tweak that sentence in your draft to make it sound even more effortless, e.g.:\n\n> “Would it be possible to keep the payment terms as Net-30, with deliverables automatically considered accepted after 7 days unless there’s written feedback? That’ll help keep the process smooth for both sides.”\n\nWould you like me to edit your full email with that tone and small refinement?",

      "content": "Excellent question — you’re thinking like someone who’s been burned before 👀  \n\nRight now, in **their version**, there’s **no cap** on how long they can sit on your work.  \nHere’s what happens under the current text:\n\n> You can only invoice *after* they give written acceptance.\n\nSo if they simply *don’t review* your deliverables, the clock for payment **never starts**.  \nThat’s why your “auto-accept after 7 days” request is important — it *creates* a cap by default.  \n\n---\n\n### 🧭 How this works in practice\nIf you add that clause — “Deliverables are deemed accepted after 7 business days unless written feedback is provided” — it means:\n- You deliver on Monday.  \n- By the following Wednesday (7 business days later), silence = acceptance.  \n- You can invoice immediately, and the 30-day payment window starts.  \n- After 37 calendar days total, you must legally be paid.  \n\nThat’s the clean, enforceable cap.\n\n---\n\n### 🧱 Without it\nIf you leave it as-is, there’s **no upper limit** — they could delay review for weeks or months, and you’d have no formal trigger for payment.\n\n---\n\n### 🪄 Optional extra protection (if you want to be bulletproof)\nYou can add one soft line like:\n\n> “If Client does not provide feedback within the 7-day review period, the Deliverables will be deemed accepted for invoicing purposes.”\n\nThat phrase — *for invoicing purposes* — keeps it friendly and non-legalistic, but it still gives you a firm clock.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Bottom line:**  \nThere’s *no cap* right now — your 7-day deemed acceptance **creates** it.  \nKeep it in your email exactly as written. It’s one of the smallest, most protective tweaks you can make.",
