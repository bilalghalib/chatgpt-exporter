I'm happy to connect you with my Bloom cofounder Munir as we've been wanting to wanting to align our work more with the IDG framework. We're currently launching a training of trainers to discuss wellbeing and engagement for the accelerator/incubator community in Lebanon and are dreaming of a conference to share learnings in the fall.\nI'll let DMN share a bit more about how he sees the potential collaborations between IDG and Bloom. Many hugs from Berlin!",

      "content": "The LinkedIn message you've written is generally good as it provides context, indicates your intentions and ends on a friendly note. However, I have a few suggestions to improve it:\n\n1. **Clear Introduction**: It's good to start with a personal note about where you met, but it might be better to introduce yourself and your role at Bloom first. If Åsa has many connections, she might not immediately remember who you are.\n\n2. **Simplify Language**: The message is a bit jargon-heavy and might be difficult for Åsa to understand if she's not familiar with the terms used. Make sure to simplify language or explain acronyms that might not be common knowledge.\n\n3. **Specific Intentions**: You mentioned wanting to align more with the IDG framework and hosting a conference, but it would be helpful to be more specific about what you're seeking from Åsa. Are you looking for her to participate, sponsor, or something else?\n\n4. **Next Steps**: Include a clear next step. Is it an invitation to a call or meeting? If so, suggest a date and time.\n\nHere's how the revised message could look like:\n\n\"Hello Åsa, \n\nI hope this message finds you well. I'm [Your Name], the co-founder of Bloom. We connected recently while in Tunis and I wanted to follow up on our discussion. \n\nBloom is currently focusing on enhancing wellbeing and engagement within the accelerator/incubator community in Lebanon. In line with this, we are launching a 'Training of Trainers' initiative and planning a conference this fall to share our learnings. \n\nWe're excited about the possibility of aligning our work more closely with the principles of the IDG (International Development Goals) framework, and believe there's potential for fruitful collaboration. \n\nI'd love to connect you with my co-founder, Munir, who can share more about our vision and explore potential synergies between IDG and Bloom. \n\nWould you be available for a call next week to discuss this in more detail? Please let me know a time that works best for you. \n\nLooking forward to continuing our conversation. \n\nBest regards from Berlin, \n[Your Name]\"\n",
