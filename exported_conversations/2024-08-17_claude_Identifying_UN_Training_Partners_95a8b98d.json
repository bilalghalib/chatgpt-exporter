BACKGROUND & JUSTIFICATION\n3.1 OVERVIEW\nThe fourth largest oil producer in the world, Iraq is classified as an upper middle-income country, and is notably\nculturally and geographically diverse. Despite its natural resource wealth, economic growth has fluctuated over the\nyears because of multiple complex factors, including political unrest, high population growth and urbanization rates,\nand oil price volatility. Human and economic development has stagnated as a result of five gruelling decades of\nsuccessive armed conflict in particular. Following the more recent periods of strife including the defeat of Islamic\nState of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the more recent months-long popular protests, the country is yet again undergoing\nthe arduous process of reconstruction and recovery amidst ongoing political and social uncertainty. In 2022, Iraq\nranked 121 of 191 countries in the Human Development Index (UNDP, 2022) and 115 of 163 in the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goal (SDG) Index Dashboard (Sachs et al, 2022).\nEmployment is a particular challenge. Insufficient stable and decent work opportunities are being created for Iraq’s\nyoung population. The labour market is characterized by high rates of unemployment at 16.5 percent (or 1.7 million\npeople) with significant differences by age and gender: while 14.7 percent of men are unemployed, this rate reaches\n28.2 percent among women, and as high as 35.8 percent among youth aged 15 to 24 (GoI, 2022). There are also\nsignificant variations by region with lowest unemployment rates seen in Babylon, at 5.5 percent, and highest rates\nin Nineveh, at 32.8 percent – over six times higher (GoI, 2022). In addition, underemployment is a significant\nchallenge to the country. In turn, a high proportion of workers are in the public sector, while informal employment\ndominates in the private sector. These situations exacerbate the country’s stagnant growth, inequalities, and social\nand political challenges.\nInvestment in the housing sector can create much-needed jobs while helping to address the country’s serious\nhousing shortage. The young and growing population, urban-rural migration, the destruction of housing in armed\nconflict, migration and internal displacement have compounded pre-existing barriers to housing construction.\nConstraints on the capacities and efficiency of both the public and private sector have left it unable to meet the need\nfor quality, affordable and sustainable housing. As a result, many live in precarious or substandard housing\nconditions, informal settlements, or overly expensive housing.\nThrough policy dialogue, technical assistance, capacity building and support in addressing key regulatory and\ninstitutional barriers to affordable housing and construction, the Project for “Building Equitable and Inclusive\nTransformation (BEIT)”. The project will combine the expertise of the United Nations Human Settlements\nProgramme (UN-Habitat), International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Trade Centre (ITC) in a multi-\nsectoral approach that results in greener, more affordable housing through the introduction of national public work\nprogramme using Employment Intensive Investment (EIIP) approach while creating quality jobs and opportunities\nfor economic growth. The joint programme outlined in this document has been designed through multiple\ngovernment consultations who have voiced their support and commitment (See Annex 5). The following proposal is\nalso in close alignment with national development priorities, particularly the economic, social and sustainability\ntargets in Iraq’s Vision for Sustainable Development 2030; the European Union’s Action Document for Support to\nDurable Solutions for Iraq’s Displaced Populations (2022); and the United Nations Sustainable Development\nCooperation Framework (UNSDCF) (2019) and other relevant UN frameworks.\n3.2 PROBLEM ANALYSIS\nThe housing sector is central to many of Iraq’s most pressing development challenges. There is a need to generate\nadditional employment opportunities and, with support for inclusive hiring and efforts to improve job quality, a\nstrengthened housing sector could create these jobs. Demographic trends, conflict, and displaced populations are\nall increasing housing demand in Iraqi cities, though there are not enough suitable and sustainable homes being\nbuilt. Constraints in the housing sector value chain are hindering the private sector – including small businesses –\nfrom responding to this excess demand. Through collaboration with civil society organizations (CSOs), public and\nprivate sector stakeholders, the joint programme will work to address these issues.\n\n7\n3.2.1 UNREALIZED EMPLOYMENT POTENTIAL IN THE HOUSING SECTOR\nThe development of the housing sector has the potential to make a major contribution to the urgent need to create\nnew and Decent jobs in Iraq. While the rapid expansion of Iraq’s working-age population creates a rare demographic\nwindow of opportunity for economic growth and opportunity, this potential is mostly being squandered. Instead,\nIraq’s inability to create sufficient jobs to absorb the rapidly growing labour force has contributed to waves of social\nunrest. Indeed, in Iraq, only 39.5 percent of the working age population aged over 15 are in the labour force (well\nbelow the global average labour force participation rate of 59.3 percent (GoI, 2022)). This is driven in particular by\nlow participation rates among youth aged 15 to 24 (10.4 percent) and women (10.5 percent) (GoI, 2022).\nIn addition, much of the economically active population is unemployed or underemployed. The overall\nunemployment rate stands at 16.5 percent (or 1.7 million people), with women (28.2 percent) and youth (35.8\npercent) disproportionately represented among the unemployed (GoI, 2022). The LFS indicates that 30.8 percent of\nthe unemployed were long-term unemployed, having been looking for employment for one year or more. This\nindicates that unemployment in Iraq is more structural and long-term than it is frictional (short period of\nunemployment between two jobs), though this situation has been exacerbated by temporary or short-term\nunemployment caused by large shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the employed, many are\nunderemployed; 7.9 percent of employed persons were working less than 40 hours a week, but wanted and were\navailable to work more hours (GoI, 2022).\nThe inability of the Iraqi economy to create sufficient quality jobs stems from related constraints in the private sector\nand the large differences between public and private sector jobs. Years of conflict, a poor business environment, a\nweak financial system, limited support services, and a lack of diversification and competition in the economy have\nconstrained job creation in the private sector. Thus, the share of employment in the private sector remains relatively\nlow at only 61.6 percent of those employed. Enlarged public sector employment results in an elevated wage bill\ncompared with peer countries (IMF, 2021). The large disparity in working conditions between the public and private\nsectors can lead many individuals to wait (by remaining inactive or unemployed) until employment in the public\nsector becomes available.\nA consequence of these challenges is the large share of informal employment, which accounts for 66.6 percent of\nall employment in Iraq. These jobs are characterized by many decent work deficits, including low wages and poor\nworking conditions, as respect for (and enforcement of) worker rights as articulated in the labour law is lower among\ninformal enterprises compared to formal ones. Furthermore, as highlighted during the pandemic, there are\nsignificant gaps in the coverage and scope of social protection. Only about 5 percent of workers in the private sector\nenrolled in social security, which protects covered workers against a limited range of social risks (excluding, for\nexample, income protection in case of unemployment and maternity). As a result, most private-sector workers are\nunprotected, and even those that are covered are vulnerable to falling into poverty in case of uncovered events.\nChild labour is also relatively common, due to families’ lack of other economic opportunities, income loss from\nviolence and displacement, and supply-side challenges in education. The Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey carried out\nby UNICEF in 2018 found that 7.3% of children aged 5 to 17 were engaged in child labour. Boys and rural children\nare particularly affected, with many children (5.9%) involved in hazardous child labour (UNICEF, 2019).\nWhile job creation should be led by inclusive growth in the private sector, the multiple challenges thereto outlined\nabove indicate that this will continue to be a challenge in the short and medium term. In such instances,\nGovernments can and do act as “employers of last resort”, intervening to directly create jobs where the markets fail\nin this regard. Such interventions can take multiple forms, from statutory employment guarantee schemes (as in the\ncase in India) to public employment programmes implemented to respond to short or longer-term unemployment\nchallenges (as in the cases of Greece and South Africa respectively). Such a scheme does not currently exist in Iraq,\nbut the Government has expressed its interest and commitment to establishing a programme aimed at supporting\nin the direct creation of employment opportunities to address the significant unemployment challenge in the\ncountry.\n3.2.2 EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE HOUSING SECTOR\n\n8\nIn addition to addressing the population’s housing needs, the growth of the housing sector has the potential to\ncreate more quality jobs. The sector already makes important economic contributions. Construction employs some\n16.3 percent of employed persons in Iraq (or 1.4 million individuals), representing the largest sector of employment\nin the country, followed closely by public administration (GOI, 2022). It contributes one of the largest shares to GDP\noutside of the oil sector. Industries linked to construction materials production is considered to be one of only two\nmanufacturing sub-sectors in the country with a “meaningful level of private activity”. In turn, the need for\nconstruction workers in the vast and enduring reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in the country makes this a\nsector with continued prospects for job creation in the short to medium term (DRC, 2020).\nImprovements in the quality and inclusiveness of employment in the sector are also needed. Many jobs are of low\nquality and insecure; 98.5 percent of workers in the construction sector are in informal employment, the highest\nrate of any sector for which such data is available. In turn, 94.9 percent of workers in the construction sector are\nemployed in informal institutions, which indicates that many workers employed in formal-sector companies are\nnevertheless in informally employment. Wages are also low; 72.4 percent of employees in the construction sector\nare on low pay (below two-thirds of the median hourly earnings of employees at their main job), the third highest\nrate of any sector.\nA recent study on the working conditions in the construction sector in governorates liberated from ISIS (Anbar,\nDiyala, Kirkuk, Ninawa and Salah Al-Deen) highlighted the many vulnerabilities faced by workers in the construction\nsector (ICRD, 2020). These including low social security coverage and awareness among workers of their rights under\nsocial security legislation; an almost complete absence of unionization and of collective agreements between\nworkers and employers in the sector; excessive overtime; low compliance with occupational health and safety\nstandards, with just under half of workers not provided with necessary personal protection equipment; and a\nwidespread violations of the labour law, including in relation to paid annual and sick leave and rest days (ICRD, 2020).\nHere are some of the key decent work deficits in the construction sector in Iraq:\n• Occupational Health and Safety: The construction industry is known for its hazardous working conditions,\nwith workers facing risks such as falling from heights, exposure to hazardous materials, and accidents\ninvolving heavy machinery. The lack of proper safety regulations and enforcement can lead to work-related\ninjuries and fatalities.\n• Low Wages and Informal Employment: Wages in the construction sector may be low, especially for casual\nor informal workers. Many workers might lack formal contracts and benefits, leading to job insecurity and\na lack of access to social protection, such as healthcare and pensions.\n• Long Working Hours: Construction projects often involve demanding schedules, leading to long working\nhours for the labour force. Extended work hours without adequate breaks can result in physical and mental\nstrain on workers.\n• Child Labour and Forced Labour: The construction industry in Iraq, like many other developing countries,\ncan be prone to the exploitation of child labour and forced labour practices. Children may be employed in\nhazardous conditions, and some workers may be forced into the sector due to economic circumstances or\ntrafficking.\n• Limited Unionization: The lack of strong labour unions or labour representation can hinder workers' ability\nto negotiate for better wages, working conditions, and benefits. This lack of collective bargaining power can\nleave workers vulnerable to exploitation by employers.\n• Discrimination and Inequality: Women in the construction industry face discrimination and unequal\ntreatment in terms of wages and job opportunities. They are often underrepresented in skilled and higher-\npaying roles.\n\n9\nAddressing these decent work deficits requires comprehensive efforts from various stakeholders, including the\ngovernment, employers, trade unions, and civil society organizations. Implementing and enforcing labour laws that\nensure fair wages, safe working conditions, and job security are crucial to improving the situation. Moreover,\npromoting social dialogue and the inclusion of marginalized groups, such as women and migrants, can help create a\nmore equitable and just construction sector in Iraq.\nMore opportunities can be created for women and any programme that focuses on affordable housing to promote\nemployment generation will have to incorporate deliberate corrective measures to ensure the participation of – and\nemployment outcomes for – women. Some 99.5 percent of workers in the construction sector in Iraq are men. Biases\nappear to contribute to this imbalance. Factors such as demographic characteristics and social behaviours (e.g. age,\ngender, interview behaviour) are typically ranked higher than qualifications and practical experience by employers\nwhen identifying factors affecting their hiring decisions (UNESCO, 2019)).\nThe trade union movement in the construction sector in Iraq has faced several challenges over the years. These\nchallenges stem from a combination of historical, political, economic, and social factors. Observations from the\ndiscussion and workshops with the trade unions in Iraq, the main problems that trade unions encounter in the\nconstruction sector in Iraq:\n• Limited Legal Framework: Iraq's labour laws have not always provided robust protection for trade union\nrights. In the past, restrictive legislation may have hampered union activities and made it difficult for unions\nto organize and collectively bargain on behalf of workers.\n• Fragmentation and Divisions: Iraq's trade union movement has experienced internal divisions and\nfragmentation. Differing ideologies, political affiliations, and regional interests among various unions have\nsometimes led to conflicts and weakened the overall effectiveness of the labour movement.\n• Lack of Collective Bargaining Power: Due to low union density and limited legal protections, trade unions in\nthe construction sector may have struggled to exert significant collective bargaining power. As a result,\nworkers may face challenges in negotiating for better wages, improved working conditions, and other\nbenefits.\n• Informal Economy: A significant portion of the construction workforce in Iraq operates in the informal\neconomy, where workers lack formal employment contracts and union representation. This makes it\ndifficult for unions to organize and protect the rights of workers in this sector effectively.\n• Economic Challenges: The construction sector's economic fluctuations and uncertainties can affect job\nsecurity for workers, making it harder for trade unions to ensure stable employment conditions and fair\ntreatment.\nSimilarly, the workshops and discussions facilitated by the ILO have presented employers' organizations with\nchallenges that can hinder their ability to effectively represent the interests of employers and contribute to the\ngrowth and development of the industry. Here are some of the key problems faced by employers' organizations:\n• Lack of Representation: In some cases, employers' organizations may struggle to represent a significant\nportion of employers in the construction sector. Low membership rates and limited participation can\nweaken their ability to advocate for the interests of the broader industry.\n• Fragmentation: Similar to trade unions, employers' organizations can suffer from fragmentation, where\ndifferent groups or associations representing employers in the construction sector may have diverse\ninterests and priorities. This can make it challenging to present a unified voice and develop coherent\npolicies.\n• Informal Economy: The construction sector in Iraq, like in many other developing countries, has a\nsubstantial informal economy. Many construction businesses operate informally, without formal\n\n10\nregistration or adherence to regulations. This makes it difficult for employers' organizations to reach and\nrepresent these entities effectively.\n• Limited Resources: Employers' organizations may face financial constraints and limited resources, affecting\ntheir capacity to carry out activities such as research, training, and advocacy on behalf of their members.\n• Limited Social Dialogue: Constructive social dialogue involving employers, trade unions, and the\ngovernment is crucial for resolving labour-related issues and fostering a conducive business environment.\nHowever, in Iraq, social dialogue might be limited, hindering the employers' organizations' ability to engage\nin constructive discussions.\n• Capacity Building: Some employers' organizations might face challenges in building the necessary capacity\nand skills to effectively represent their members and address complex labour and business issues.\nAddressing these challenges necessitates collaborative endeavours from a range of stakeholders, encompassing\nworkers' and employers' organizations, government bodies, and pertinent institutions. Enhancing labour legislation\nto safeguard trade union rights, fostering social dialogue, delivering training and capacity-building assistance, and\nnurturing a culture of collective bargaining all contribute to fortifying trade unions and augmenting the\nrepresentation of construction workers' concerns. In the context of enhancing employers' organizations, strategies\nmay encompass providing training and capacity-building support, facilitating networking opportunities among\nemployers, promoting collaboration among diverse associations, and advocating for policies that advance a\nformalized and regulated construction sector.\nIn addition, extended efforts need to be made to support local partners in designing, formulating, implementing and\nevaluating policies and programmes aiming to address unemployment and underemployment through public\ninvestment, typically in infrastructure development. Employment Intensive Approaches reinforce and build\ninstitutional and operational capacity to provide productive and decent work that has an economic, environmental,\nand social impact. Whilst labour-based construction activities result in short-term employment, the improved\ninfrastructure they produce contributes to increasing economic performance in other sectors, generating multiplier\neffects on employment and income throughout the economy.\n3.2.3 NEED FOR GREEN JOBS IN THE HOUSING SECTOR\nGreen jobs generally referred to decent jobs, which contribute to preserving or restoring the environment. These\njobs can be in traditional sectors such as manufacturing and construction, or in new, emerging green sectors such as\nrenewable energy and energy efficiency. The housing sector has the potential to create green jobs and to help\ndiversify the Iraqi economy. There is a strong connection between the climate crisis and the jobs crisis in Iraq, and\nthere are various channels through which the impacts of climate change will further worsen the quality and quantity\nof jobs in Iraq. As countries across the globe eventually move away from their reliance on fossil fuels, government\nrevenue from oil will weaken, which may result in downward pressures on public employment, reliant as this is on\noil revenue. The potential of agricultural and other sectors may also decline as the impacts of climate change are\nincreasingly felt.\nAgainst this background, it is essential for the Government of Iraq to support the creation of jobs that are not only\nresilient to the impacts of climate change, but also that contribute to adapting the Iraqi economy and society to\nthose same impacts. But to foster the creation of green jobs, it is also first imperative to support the engagement\nand expansion of private-sector businesses in the green economy, and for these to adopt green business practices.\nThe green skills in the Iraqi labour force must also be strengthened to meet the opportunities presented by green\njob creation. In the housing sector, this includes training workers involved in architecture, engineering, and\nconstruction in the use of energy efficient methods, designs and approaches.\nThe Employment Intensive Investment Programme provides an opportunity for change and innovation. It helps to\nreduce future impact of climate change on people, economies and the environment by promoting local-resource\n\n11\nbased methods for constructing and maintaining assets, while providing employment opportunities and enhancing\nthe productive capacity of ecosystems. Climate smart investments in housing sector have the potential to create\njobs and sustain livelihoods for many of those who will be the most affected in the informal sector, especially women\nand youth. In addition, public works using Employment Intensive Approaches have been key to the extension of\nsocial protection where informal economic activity is the greatest, thus supporting local economic, social and\nenvironmental development in both rural and urban areas.\n3.2.4 SHORTAGE OF ADEQUATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING\nHousing is a key determinant of progress on sustainable development, peace and social stability. Access to housing\nis not only a fundamental right and basic human need, but also essential for promoting equality and maintaining\nsocial cohesion, and crucial to averting discontent, especially in politically fragile countries such as Iraq. The social\nimpact of housing is high, ensuring equal access to adequate and affordable housing can vastly improve quality of\nlife and living standards and is fundamental for a country’s economic welfare and in assuring a productive and stable\nworkforce. For a family, housing is at the core of social, economic, and emotional lives and a safe and stable home\nis fundamental to physical and mental health and can help to create ladders to other opportunities. Children greatly\nbenefit from stable housing conditions which facilitates access to uninterrupted education, reduces exposure to\nunhealthy surroundings, and provides a sense of safety and security. When a family is burdened with the lack of a\nroof over their heads it is hard to imagine getting a foot on other opportunities.\nIraq faces an enormous housing deficit that is only expected to worsen in the future. The ISIS conflict aggravated an\nalready chronic housing shortage that in 2010 was thought to be around 1.4 million housing units, but now more\nrecent estimates in 2022 from the Ministry of Construction Housing Municipalities and Public Works projects a 3.5-\nmillion-unit housing shortage (Kardiu, 2022 and Ibrahim, 2022). It is estimated that Iraq’s population will increase to\nover 50 million people by 2030 from an estimated 40.2 million in 2021. According to the World Bank, in 1960, 43\npercent of the population lived in urban areas, and that proportion increased precipitously to 71 percent by 2021.\nUrbanization rates are estimated to continue to climb at an annual increase of 2.91 percent between 2020 and 2025\n(CIA, 2020) which will continue to put increasing pressure on cities to supply ample housing, sufficient infrastructure,\nand basic services to inflowing populations.\nRapid urbanization can be attributed to many intertwined factors including past policies, inadequate access to\nservices in rural areas, a lack of employment opportunities, the poor performance of the agricultural sector, and the\nhard felt impacts of climate change (Hassan et al, 2023). In Iraq, these circumstances are driving people to migrate\nto urban areas seeking improved economic opportunities and a better quality of life. Water scarcity and\nunproductive agricultural land in Iraq has also contributed to rapid urbanization. Environmental degradation\nincluding the salinization of water and soils, desertification, and the disappearance of arable land due to poor\nresource management and climate change will likely continue to reinforce migration to Iraqi cities. Increasingly,\nfarmers are being forced to migrate to cities in search of civil and military jobs due to the consequences of climate\nchange (Hassan 2023 and IOM Iraq, 2022).\nFurthermore, the existing housing stock is deteriorating, particularly in central urban areas due to age and neglect\n(MOCH and UN-Habitat, 2010). The slow production of new housing coupled with the dilapidation and destruction\nof existing housing has had the dual consequence of constricted supply and upward market pressures which have\nfuelled soaring housing and land prices, and high rents, particularly in the central urban areas that are well-served\nby infrastructure. Meanwhile, Iraq’s wealthy are also snatching up high-end real estate throughout Iraqi cities as\ninvestment vehicles and as a means to safeguard money amidst the currency devaluation, essentially creating a dual\nhousing market (Shafaq News, 2023).\n3.2.5 EFFECTS OF CONFLICT ON HOUSING\nThe lack of affordable and adequate housing in Iraq has been further compounded by the millions of people\ninternally displaced during the ISIS conflict which forced families into informal housing arrangements, overcrowded\nand substandard living conditions. At the peak of the ISIS crisis, there were 6 million displaced within the country,\nmostly in urban and peri-urban areas (IOM, 2021). According to a 2021 survey conducted by the Ministry of\n\n12\nDisplacement and Migration (MODM), 241,659 people remain displaced in Iraq. They cannot return to their area of\norigin, do not have the financial resources to rebuild their destroyed homes, and thus are unable to re-establish their\nlives. Among those that have started to return, many experienced challenges, particularly tenants, or those whose\nproperty is either occupied or damaged.\nIn 2018, the World Bank completed a multi-sectoral assessment on the destructive impact of conflict in seven Iraqi\ngovernorates which found that housing had been the most affected sector, with total damages amounting to around\nUSD 16.1 billion. Over 138,000 residential buildings were thought to have been impacted, of which half were\ndestroyed beyond repair. The most severe impact was felt in the Ninewa governorate, followed by Salah al-Din,\nAnbar, Kirkuk, and Diyala. Estimates indicate that to address the legacy housing shortage and reconstruction efforts,\napproximately IQD 25 trillion (USD $17.4 billion) is needed (UN Iraq, 2022).\nThe widespread destruction of homes has especially impacted low-income populations, worsening their already\nfragile situation. Those displaced by conflict are not only more likely to be in poverty and unemployed but in many\ncases, they are forced to pay rent for housing elsewhere even though they already own a home. A report by IOM\n(2019), concluded that 81 percent of those displaced during the ISIS conflict already owned their homes, many of\nwhich were then forced to also pay rent elsewhere at the expense of other basic needs. This has created severe\neconomic burdens for those already living in highly volatile situations, and the need for an additional house has\nfurther constrained the already limited housing supply. Furthermore, according to UNHCR (2019) 250,000,\npredominantly, Syrian, refugees reside in Iraq which puts additional pressure on the limited housing stock and puts\nmore families in highly precarious living situations. At the same time, new waves displacement caused by climate\nand/ or territorial disputes continue to further compound the housing deficit.\nAddressing housing challenges through facilitating the creation of safe and decent housing can contribute to the\ncountry’s social stability. This means assuring that Iraq’s most vulnerable populations can access adequate and\naffordable housing and have access to basic services which will require greatly bolstering housing production for\nlower-income segments and making sure that there is security of tenure. This will also require targeting locations\nfor social housing production to areas where future social unrest could be averted as a result of more stable living\nconditions. In doing so, actions also need to be taken to assure that housing is placed in the hands of the intended\nbeneficiaries through stringent programmatic guidelines and enforcement that make sure resources are not\nmisappropriated or squandered. UN-Habitat and the GOI will work in partnership to test new models in targeted\nareas where social housing could support neighbourhood stabilization.\n3.2.6 INEQUALITIES IN ACCESS TO HOUSING\nThe housing shortage has disproportionately impacted low-income and vulnerable families who get pushed further\nand further out of the market as land supplies are constrained and prices escalate, and government programs fail to\nadequately respond. One consequence of this is that informal settlements have grown rapidly throughout the\ncountry, increasing by 138 percent between 2012 and 2016 reaching 3,687 settlements, which is a 138% increase\ncompared to 2013, as the number of dwellings reached 521,947. The population of slum dwellers is about 3,292,606,\n(accounting for 12.9%) of the total population in Iraq. For example, in Baghdad, 1,022 informal settlements were\nidentified, Basra has 667 areas. The lowest governorates were Najaf and Karbala (88 and 89 respectively). The\nnumber of dwellings is estimated around 525, 000 units which represent around 16.5 % of the total housing sector\nin Iraq. In Baghdad, the informal settlement sector represents around 26% of the total housing. The total inhabitants\nin the informal sector are estimated to be around 3.3 million inhabitants (12.9 %) (IDBG and UN-Habitat, 2020). More\nrecent statements from the MOP, reported that in 2022, Iraq has over 5,000 slum areas, containing more than half\na million housing units and 3.5 million people, or approximately 10 percent of the population (Zeed 2021, Zidane,\n2022).\nOver the last three decades, the World Bank (2017) contends that 90 percent of all housing was self-constructed,\nlikely in an informal manner. Most informal settlements are built on state-owned land, in both urban and suburban\nareas. Increasingly, they are also constructed on agricultural land where farmers are razing orchards due to drought\nand selling off plots for residential development. Many settlements have also sprouted up on land already assigned\n\n13\nto be high-rise housing complexes, public facilities, road reserves, or infrastructure projects such as railway tracks or\nairports, presenting enormous challenges to future planned development.\nThe housing predicament has also led to other ad hoc responses, including households sub-dividing existing plots in\nan unregulated manner to make room for other family members or rental tenants. A survey conducted in 2011\nrevealed that 12.8 percent of urban households are occupied by two or more families, while 21.7 percent are over-\ncrowded with 3 or more persons per room (COS, 2011).\n1\nProducing more low-cost housing that is delivered through discrete housing programs, as will be tested in this\nproject, can support in assuring that new housing is well-designed, constructed with durable materials and serviced\nwith infrastructure that abides by building codes and planning regulations. Social housing construction projects can\nalso produce housing that is more compact and thus better utilizes the limited land supply and is less taxing on\ninfrastructure. In this respect, directly building social housing not only provides security of tenure and improved\nhousing conditions, but it can also help stymie the creation of new informal housing settlements through ensuring\naffordable housing production is happening in targeted locations and that sustainable development principles apply.\nWomen in Iraq have less secure access to housing. Landowners are disproportionately male; 73.8 percent of land is\nowned by men (FAO, 2017). Even though equal property rights are enshrined in law, women continue to face\nchallenges exercising their land rights. The situation is especially intensified among females who were displaced\nduring recent conflicts. A study by the Norwegian Refugee Council (2020) on women’s Housing Land & Property\n(HLP) rights in post-conflict Iraq found that women were 9 percent more likely to fear eviction than men, especially\nfor returnees who were 14 percent more likely than men to fear eviction in the coming six months. Furthermore, 9\npercent of displaced women report their housing being occupied by community or tribal leaders, militias, and\nsecurity forces. The NRC research outlines four key interlinked challenges women face in protecting and claiming\nland: the interplay between formal and customary norms regarding women’s right to own and claim property;\nperception and community knowledge of women’s rights to own and claim property; lack of documentation of\nwomen’s property rights; and the treatment of women who are perceived to be affiliated with ISIS. Land and\nproperty rights for women remain an ongoing challenge in Iraq, particularly for female heads of household with\nchildren following the death or disappearance of a spouse. With only a perceived secondary right to HLP, women\nusually lose out and have few alternatives in a post-conflict environment. In this respect, greater attention is needed\nto ensure that access to housing, land and property rights are equally available to women.\nThe right to adequate housing is integral to advancing equity and inclusion of women and in realizing basic human\nrights. Making sure that women are fully represented in planning and policy development decisions can help to\nassure equity and inclusion of women so that all perspectives are heard and ultimately emmeshed in housing\nprogramme design. Affordable housing programs that adopt participatory approaches to decision-making processes\ncan directly address the housing needs of women and girls and can support women in realizing equal access to\nhousing and in ensuring security of tenure. Government can have direct control over designing housing programs,\nparticularly when they are government sponsored, in manner that ensures that women are free from discrimination\nand inequality. Housing eligibility for benefits can also be designed in a manner that is preferential to those who\nhave been historically discriminated against or other vulnerable groups.\n3.2.7 GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOUSING\nHousing has been enshrined as a top priority in multiple national plans, including Iraq’s Vision for Sustainable\nDevelopment 2030 (MoP, 2019), the National Housing Policy (MoCH and UN-Habitat, 2009 and 2017), National\nDevelopment Plan (MoP, 2018), the Strategy for the Reduction of Poverty (MoP et al., 2018), and the National Plan\nfor Reconstruction and Development Framework (GOI, 2018). Within these agendas the need to address the\ninadequate supply of housing has been fully recognized, and yet, viable long-term strategies have yet to materialize.\nIn past decades, the GOI has tested various housing programmes such as donating millions of plots of land to those\nwho do not already own homes (MoCH and UN-Habitat, 2009), initiating the National and Provincial Investment\n1 \nUN-Habitat defines crowded condition as three or more people residing per room.\n\n14\nCommissions to spur private sector investment, and expanding the lending portfolios of its state banks, all with the\nintention of addressing the overall housing deficit, however, they have predominantly failed in targeting lower\nincome and vulnerable residents or in adequately addressing affordable housing need (Shafaq News, 2023). For\nexample, plots provided to households intended to self-construct housing frequently sit vacant without resources\navailable to support housing construction or are sold into the secondary market for profit (GOI, 2009). Furthermore,\nthe availability of home loans are often limited to higher incomes where collateral can be secured.\nThe GOI also constructs a small fraction of public housing typically intended for public employees, but production\nof this type of housing in current times is relatively insignificant. Government housing only ever accounted for about\n15 percent of the housing stock and the majority was constructed in the 1960s and 1970s in large high-rise public\nhousing estates which are now in many cases in disrepair – reportedly in relatively fair to poor condition. Recent\nestimates indicates that state housing currently only accounts for 1-2% of the housing stock (UN-Habitat, 2023 N.P)\n2\n.\nAccording to the Iraq Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) study in 2019, 80% of families owned their home, 15%\nrent and the remainder live in other arrangements. Similarly, in Kurdistan 79% of people own their own home\n(Kurdistan Ministry of Planning, 2013). Iraqi households prefer low-rise single-family dwellings, which are typically\nself-built or constructed by a small contractor. This type of housing is often suited for incremental expansion to\naccommodate additional family members or rental units, as economic circumstances permit. Often, households\nsubdivide and densify one plot of land, which can result in stresses to the existing infrastructure and ad hoc\ndevelopment and unplanned densification.\nMore recently, the GOI has pursued developing large housing estates in entirely new neighbourhoods by attracting\nforeign and domestic investment through public private partnerships via the National Investment Commission to\naddress the housing shortage. The estates offer a mix of housing typologies including high rise buildings as well as\nsingle family estates, but often cater to upper-income households despite significant developer incentives and\naffordability project guidelines and requirements. Furthermore, the investment projects have faced significant\nhurdles and frequent construction delays due to the events of the past decade and the continued precarious security\nsituation. The recent economic crisis also caused the diversion of funds from the national budget to anti-terrorism\nactivities which resulted in stalled payments to contractors and put a pause on investment projects (Fadhil and\nBurhan, 2021), leaving Iraq’s ability to attract future investors even as circumstances improve, challenging.\nWhile the GOI has made formidable efforts to bolster housing production through a market-driven enabling\napproach, adequate housing remains largely out of reach for lower-income households (Shafaq News, 2023).\nConcerted efforts are needed to significantly increase the supply of affordable housing which often entails\ngovernment investment, to some degree, including subsidies, soft or forgivable loans, or the formulation of policies\nsuch as inclusionary housing which offers developer incentives and/or requires mandatory set-asides. Therefore,\nnew financial tools are needed that cater to the housing needs for those who are currently shut out of the market.\nIn this respect, the proposed project aims to support the government in developing new finance mechanisms that\nmaximize government resources and at the same time, targets households that need financial support to obtain\ndecent housing.\n3.2.8 CAPACITY GAPS\nHousing sector governance in Iraq has long been undermined by a lack of technical capacity, fractured governance\nsystems, and weak or absent enforcement and control mechanisms. This results in insecurity of tenure, informal and\nunplanned development, and a dearth of buildable land. Despite efforts to decentralize governance (under Law 21\nof 2006) and increases in the number of public employees over the past two decades, progress has been slow. The\nNational Development Plan (2018) identified the primary institutional challenges that the country is facing as low\nefficiency and institutional performance, overstaffing and low productivity, and financial and administrative\ncorruption.\n2 \nResponses from questionnaire administered to Housing and Planning Directorates by UN-Habitat, 2023.\n\n15\nManagerial staff lacks basic expertise on housing, land management and urban planning, including administrative\ncapacities and the aptitude to ensure projects get properly executed. The lack of expertise and capacity at the local\nlevel, especially in the face of ever-changing uncertainties, has impaired planning authorities in cities, especially in\ntheir ability to appropriately plan and budget over the long term. Moreover, overlapping jurisdictional authorities\nand responsibilities between the federal, provincial, and local levels has caused significant conflict among\ndepartments, which has stymied local housing development projects and hampered plan implementation.\nThe proposed project will support the GOI in addressing Iraq’s housing challenges which will require strategic efforts\nto build the technical capacity of government employees in addressing the housing deficit particularly for low-\nincome and vulnerable groups. Building the institutional capacity at all levels of government to develop sound\nevidence base policies, produce enabling legislation and regulatory frameworks, create new financial tools and\ntarget funds to support those most in need will not only promote a more equitable society and support in improving\nliving standards for those most in need, but it also supports economic stability and growth while at same time\ncreating decent jobs. This approach will require coordinated efforts between the private sector, CSOs, local\norganizations, donors, and the government. Better targeting of financial resources and a sound regulatory\nframework will ensure funds realize a greater impact, and with proper control mechanisms can assure that homes\nactually get built, on time and within budget, and delivered to the intended target population.\n3.2.9 CLIMATE IMPACTS ON THE HOUSING SECTOR\nIn addition to the impacts of quality and access on human development, Iraq’s housing sector has a considerable\nimpact on pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Housing is intrinsically linked to climate change to the extent\nthat is a major producer of emissions but also in the respect that housing protects people from the effects of severe\ntemperatures and other climate events. In this sense, environmentally friendly and resource efficient housing can\nsupport slowing climate change and preventing the worst of its impacts through climate adaption and mitigation\nefforts both in how housing is constructed as well as where it is located. Increasingly, there is a need for resilient\nhousing that is adapted to rising temperatures and other climate risks. Improvements to the sector therefore need\nto address its climate impacts, through climate sensitive design, improved construction practices and materials, and\nsustainable site design and locations, including adoption of measures that reduce energy demand.\nHousing design and construction, directly affects residential demand for energy for heating and cooling. Estimates\nsuggest that cities are responsible for 75 percent of global CO2 emissions, in which buildings and transportation\ncomprise the largest contributors (UNEP Website, 2022). In fact, residential and commercial buildings are\nresponsible for over one-third of all energy-related GHG emissions (International Energy Agency, 2019). In Iraq, the\nlargest consumer of electricity is the residential sector representing 48.3 percent of total consumption (Istepanian,\n2020b). Heating and cooling are responsible for much of this demand; in Baghdad, it accounts for 69 percent of\nenergy use in homes (Hasan, 2012).\nWhile Iraq’s uniform building code is not always effective in directing design and construction, it sets some minimum\nstandards for the construction sector. Further, there are no energy efficiency certification processes or rating\nsystems. Energy conservation measures therefore remain entirely voluntary. While appliance standards with energy\nratings exists for a limited number of appliances for the GCC, the standards lack enforcement (Istepanian, 2020).\nBeyond the environmental cost of unreliable and inefficient energy systems, utility costs can pose significant cost\nburdens to households and can make a up a large proportion of housing expenses, particularly for low-income\nhouseholds. In this respect, installing energy efficient and renewable measures can help support more affordable\nand reliable electricity and can realize substantial housing cost savings. Unfortunately, in Iraq, high levels of\nelectricity and fuel subsidies act as a disincentive to reduce consumption, but at the same time, the dysfunctional\nnetwork has resulted in high levels of consumer dissatisfaction, theft of services and corruption which in turn,\nprohibits raising tariffs. Further, when households are not being supplied with network electricity, they face the\nexcessive cost of generators which is nine-fold that of the grid (IEA, 2019b). Generators provide less than 15 percent\nof electricity consumed but accounts for more than 90 percent of consumer spending on electricity (IEA, 2019b)\nwhich can amount to as much as IQD 5.8 million (USD $4k) annually. In some scenarios, Iraqis households can spend\neight times the average electricity bill in the MENA region, one of the highest rates in the world (IEA, 2019b) resulting\n\n16\nin significant household expenditures and housing cost burden, yet basic cost-effective energy conservation\nmeasures still appear absent in Iraqi homes. For example, solar heaters and photovoltaic panels which can be\nextremely cost effective and have enormous potential in Iraq, are not typically utilized in Iraq unlike other MENA\ncountries. In this respect, an affordable housing programme could be a test bed for energy efficiency solutions in\nIraq, and support raising awareness about the effectiveness and cost savings potential, and at the same time, realize\nsignificant reductions in emissions.\nEmissions from buildings can be addressed by making buildings more energy efficient or by minimizing ‘pre-use’\nemissions from construction and materials manufacturing and transport. Currently, housing is largely designed and\nconstructed with little regard for climatic conditions or cultural context which has resulted in highly inefficient\nbuildings (Al-Taie et al, 2012) and significant environmental and costly consequences borne by importing materials.\nIraq rates fifth most vulnerable country in the world to extreme temperatures and water shortages (UN Environment\nProgramme, 2017). Without efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate challenges through a more sustainable housing\nsector, climate challenges will likely magnify. The World Green Building Council (2023) outlines the business case for\nsustainable and affordable housing including the cost of inaction such as follows: spiralling energy demand, increases\nin informal settlements and continued unmanaged sprawl that can exacerbate inequality and socio spatial disparity,\nthe risk of abandoned assets such as infrastructure and public services due to climate scenarios, increased risk of\nfinancial and energy poverty, reduced resilience and increased susceptibility of destruction to less durable\nstructures, and health risks due to unhealthy housing, pollution and increased temperatures.\nAddressing climate change through housing will require a multi-pronged approach. This proposed joint project will\nsupport the wider adoption of alternative approaches to help transform the impact of the Iraqi housing sector on\nthe environment. The following green measures will be considered in the housing design and construction process:\nTraditional building styles and materials: Traditional materials that present green characteristics are used\nmarginally, in rural areas or in small-scale CSO initiatives. They include stone in lieu of blocks or brick, the use of clay\nand straw to make bricks, and reed as a substitute for iron rebar.\n3 \nIn some circumstances, reverting to vernacular\narchitecture techniques could also be considered a practical means to reintroduce more sustainable building\ntechnologies and passive cooling solutions. In all three cities where stakeholder interviews were conducted,\ninterviewees expressed concern over the high temperatures in the summer that can exceed 50°C. Some stakeholders\nuse designs that support the natural ventilation of the buildings. Rapid improvements could be made if the skills and\nexpertise that account for specific local geographies were further developed and deployed in a concerted and scaled-\nup manner.\nLocally adapted design: Building modelling that considers local geographic contexts can also support the\nidentification of the most appropriate building materials and construction methods that can be utilised to increase\nbuilding efficiency, quality, and performance, and further reduce cost.\nLocally produced building materials: The international transportation of building materials is a source of pollution.\nLocal materials can thus have a smaller carbon footprint than equivalent imported materials while their manufacture\ncreates new economic opportunities.\nAdvanced construction methods: New building technologies, such as modular or pre-cast housing and bringing\nstandardized building components to market, could be used as a strategy to ramp up production and produce cost\neffective durable and sustainable housing, which could realize enormous environmental benefits and lower both\nconstruction costs and utility expenses.\nSolar panels and water heating: A report by the International Energy Agency (2019b), asserts that the falling price\nof renewable sources offers feasible alternative power solutions and can increase reliability and reduce the cost of\nelectricity supply. Because solar sources are particularly good in Iraq, the report further contends that if the solar\nindustry were developed it could currently outcompete oil-fired generation in terms of levelized costs of electricity\n3 \nStakeholder interview.\n\n17\nand compete with gas-fired plants by 2030. Stakeholders in Baghdad and Erbil believe there is high potential for\nsolar panels as an alternative and cheaper source of electricity.\n4\nEnergy efficient materials, appliances and equipment: According to the International Energy Agency (2019)\nprogrammes to encourage energy conservation and efficiency should be given priority in Iraq. Measures such as\nutilizing high-efficiency cooling systems can deliver immediate benefits and the realize significant cost savings.\nFurther, the IEA contends that the use of high efficiency appliances should be coupled with consumer campaigns\nthat raise awareness on energy efficient measures and potential cost savings. Insulation is also sometimes used as\nobserved on high rise buildings in Erbil.\nWater conservation: Iraq depends on neighbouring countries for an estimated 70 percent of water supply and river\nlevels have dropped an estimated 40 percent in the last two decades (IEA, 2019b). Untreated water along with other\nfactors such as salinization of the water supply, inefficient water management, governance and regulatory\nframeworks, and upstream supply issues from neighbouring countries are contributing factors to Iraq’s water\nscarcity. In 2020, 18 percent of the population were considered to live in water-scarce areas (World Data Lab, 2021).\nThere is a need for better water management systems such as the treatment and recycling of domestic water waste.\nWater conservation measures such as energy efficient water pumping systems, grey water recycling, rain barrel\nharvesting, drought resilient landscaping, low flow plumbing fixtures could be considered at the community/\nhousehold level in Iraq.\nSanitation systems: 85.7 percent of households across all governorates have access to basic water services (UNICEF\nMICS, 2018). However, only 40 percent have access to safely managed water and around 23 percent to safely\nmanaged sanitation (UN, 2021). While most Iraqi’s have access to some form of improved sanitation (99% urban/\n90% rural) only a small proportion are linked to a piped sewage network (33 percent urban/ 4 percent rural) and\ninstead depend on septic tanks or sewage holes (UN-Habitat website). Further, existing water and sewage\ninfrastructure in Iraq, including treatment plants and pipe networks, are largely in disrepair; 83% of wastewater is\ninsufficiently treated posing significant health and environmental risks (UN-Habitat website). Improved sanitation\nsystems are needed, as those in old urban centres are overburdened by densification. In newly urbanized areas, they\nare often very basic. Septic tanks are not properly maintained, and liquid waste pollutes ground water. Furthermore,\nthe investment in sanitation systems is an additional cost to low-income households in areas where infrastructure\nis lacking.\nEnergy standards and green rating systems: Ratings systems help to assess and ensure that buildings meet a broad\nrange of predefined green standards. There are many good international examples of green rating systems (i.e.,\nBREEAM, GBC, LEED) that can be adapted and adopted to fit within the Iraqi climate and geographical context.\nFurthermore, the development of energy codes and standards that set the minimum energy performance\nrequirements for both new buildings and existing buildings should be enmeshed into the uniform building code that\nenshrines the construction of adequate and healthy homes into law. Energy standards can include equipment and\nappliances including lighting, plumbing, commercial and industrial, and consumer products.\nCompact Development: To achieve more sustainable development patterns that reduces climate impact and\nbolsters resilience, Iraq will need to move towards more compact development that utilizes land more efficiently\nand reduces infrastructure burdens. Compact development can reduce sprawl and car dependency, create more\nwalkable and accessible environments, and increase efficiency in providing infrastructure and services. Increasing\ndensity can have significant impact on reducing the carbon footprint, lowering emissions, and preventing continued\nenvironmental degradation. Furthermore, sustainable housing includes choosing site locations that are more\nresilient and less vulnerable to climate risks and hazards (flooding, drought, dust storms, fires, etc.). At the same\ntime, all housing is to an extent vulnerable to climate change and therefore, should be constructed in a manner that\nis more resilient and suitably constructed to local climatic conditions. New construction should be designed and\nconstructed deliberately responding to the local climatic risks so that it can withstand climate events, for example,\n4 \nSolar energy only represents “0.1% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),” hydroelectricity is “2.1% of total installed capacity\n(2020 est.).” Iraq is a net importer of electricity. (CIA World Factbook).\n\n18\nutilizing highly durable materials, adjusting designs to withstand flooding, or integrating passive cooling or thermal\nmeasures to reduce heat exposure.\n3.2.10 KEY CHALLENGES IN THE SECTOR’S VALUE CHAIN\nThe capacities of the housing sector to meet the demand for more and higher quality housing are insufficient.\nHousing in Iraq is mainly supplied through self-construction, most of which is informal. The government and the\nprivate sector are also involved in the provision of housing, but the overall supply of housing is insufficient. The\nformal supply of housing is characterized by high prices as well as housing units that are not adapted to the needs\nof the households, with estimated costs even higher for self-construction. The quality and sustainability of housing\nalso suffers as a result of weaknesses in firm capacities and organization across the value chain.\nAnalysis of the current situation and stakeholder interviews highlight how the potential of the sector to grow and\nreduce costs is held back at multiple points by factors including the unreliability of land titles, skills shortages, limited\ncapacities and coordination in the private sector, poor urban planning and overburdened infrastructure, financial\nconstraints, and the burdens of administrative costs and procedures (Figure 1). Creating quality jobs, expanding the\nsupply of housing, and better managing the sector’s climate impact will require solutions to the most serious\nconstraints in the housing sector value chain.\n\nFIGURE 1. CURRENT HOUSING SECTOR VALUE CHAIN AND KEY CHALLENGES\n\nGovernance and regulation\nAccording to several stakeholders, the biggest barriers to construction are administrative. More specifically, the\nregulatory framework governing the access and operation of housing and construction services, as well as the\nprocedural framework in place to attract and facilitate investments into these sectors act as significant barriers to\nthe development and growth of these sectors. Furthermore, these rules are not always respected. This is due to\nweak enforcement of rules and regulations in general and is not specific to the construction sector. Construction\npermits represent another high cost that investors cannot always predict with precision, as there is subjectivity in\nthe process.\nIraq’s housing laws are generally fragmented, piecemeal, and outmoded. A new housing law was proposed as part\nof the plan for Housing and Reconstruction in Liberated Areas, covering technical, legislative, administrative, and\nfinancial aspects of housing. However, the passage of the law has been stalled. The Federal Budget Law (2023-25)\nadopted in June includes a considerable increase in capital expenditure, with housing and construction among the\nsectors with the largest growth in allocations, as well as commitments to invest in various construction and\ninfrastructure projects across the country. Land allocations have also been used in an attempt to improve access to\nhousing, though these initiatives have had limited success in addressing barriers to accessing affordable housing for\nlow- and middle-income Iraqis.\nFrom the household perspective, constructing a home through formal means often entails an expensive, and long\nand arduous bureaucratic process. Policies and practices which constrain the responsiveness of the market, such as\nrestrictive zoning and planning regulations, and lengthy and costly bureaucratic procedures escalates prices and\ndiminishes quality, and generally leads to underinvestment in the housing market (World Bank, 2020). According to\na UNESCO (2019) report, procedures for allocating land, registering property, and obtaining construction licenses\nare burdensome and hindered by heavy bureaucracy, which ultimately result in higher housing prices. Beyond the\nresidential sector, the World Bank’s Doing Business report (2019) found that obtaining a construction permit can\nentail up to 11 procedures and 167 days. Further, registering a property entails five procedures, can take up to 51\ndays and costs up to 7.3 percent of the property value. A transfer of title deeds requires several signatures from\nregional and national authorities which can require extensive travel, time, and back and forth (Fleet, 2019).\nPriorities for the project addressing challenges in governance and regulation include supporting public works,\naddressing the governance of affordable housing, and strengthening capacities for policy formulation and\nimplementation on construction sector development.\nPlanning and infrastructure\nWeak urban planning and infrastructure development affect construction, increase the uncertainty facing investors,\nand reduce the ultimate quality and sustainability of housing in Iraq. There is a disconnect between urban planning\nand urban development in Iraqi cities. The lengthy process of approving new plans often leaves them obsolete by\nthe time they are made official. For example, the Master Plan of Baghdad was only recently approved after decades\nof work and revisions. Consequently, construction projects are developed either informally or with special permits\nthat do not always comply with these plans. Planning may also not take into consideration the needs of residents.\nFor instance, one Erbil contractor reported that some formally authorized plots of land in his city meet the\nrequirement in terms of minimum surface area but have an elongated shape that complicates design and\nconstruction.\nUnplanned urbanization and underinvestment in infrastructure result in overburdened infrastructure. Building\nconstruction in new developments sometimes precedes the full provision of infrastructure and basic services.\nAlthough the electrification rate in Iraq is reported to be 100%, electricity supply is unreliable, Iraqi households and\nbusinesses experience frequent outages and the problem is accentuated in the summer months when cooling\nsystems are used. While roads are eventually built, it is not uncommon for sanitation systems to remain basic,\ncausing ground pollution. Cities often suffer from drainage problems. Even minor rainfall can cause partial flooding\non roads, which in turn affects traffic.\n\n21\nLocal planning capacities will be strengthened through the project. In addition, multi-stakeholder capacity\ndevelopment, policy dialogue and strategy design activities under the project will include support for stronger urban\nplanning that is better integrated with infrastructure and housing development.\nLand\nIraq faces an acute shortage of buildable land in urban areas to satisfy housing demand. While many factors are\nbehind this, informal housing and affordable housing deficits are, in part, the result of weak land governance,\nadministration and enforcement systems. Restrictions on use are classified in the title, and whenever a construction\npermit or transfer of property happens, the land use of a property can come under review with the authorities, but\nthis is often done in an arbitrary manner. Furthermore, the conversion of land for housing construction is\ndisconnected from larger development frameworks and fails to plan for the appropriate density and scale the city\nwould need to effectively meet future housing demand. Limited official statistics on land use, paper-based land\nregistry systems and the lack of an e-cadastre also complicates the measurement and tracking of shortages and\nfurther inhibits planning for future development and complicates private investment decisions.\nThe cost of land and issues with land titles can be major constraints to real estate development. Although land prices\nwere not raised as a major constraint by stakeholders in Erbil and Basra, where new urban areas are being developed,\nland was reported to be rare and expensive in Baghdad. Stakeholders reported that fraud on land titles had become\na common business. Information on deaths, inheritance, and individuals who expatriate is sold, as these life events\nprovide others with the opportunity to illegally take over physical assets administratively.\nThe illegal occupation of land by informal settlements, motivated by the scarcity of affordable homes, is a further\nconstraint to investment and construction. The informal occupation of land also increases the households’\nvulnerability as they can be evicted and lose both their shelter and the investment in the self-construction.\nSometimes they also lose their investment in the land as the informal or illegal occupation of the land does not mean\nthey didn’t need to pay to occupy it. Furthermore, if the land is not suitable for construction, the households are\nalso exposed to disaster risks such as floods, land erosion and landslides.\nFinance\nFinancial underdevelopment is a barrier to construction and limits the affordability of housing. Iraq remains a largely\ncash-based economy. Because of the limited access to housing finance, only high and medium-high income\nhouseholds can afford to buy quality homes. In most cases, new homes that are self-built or constructed by small\ncontractors are paid for either in cash through household savings or by borrowing from family or friends. In the case\nof investment projects, homes are often financed by the developer in instalments, with the first payment often\ntaking place before the housing unit is completed (off-plan sales). Sometimes, developers only require a certain\npercentage of the total price to be paid before the household can move in. The household continues to make\npayments over a few months (a couple of years at the most) and the individual property title is transferred after the\nlast payment is made. Financing rules may need to be adjusted to foster improved housing affordability while\ndiscouraging purely speculative investment in housing.\nHousing loans are typically provided by state-funded lending institutions through the Real Estate Bank (REB) and\nNational Housing Fund (NHF).\n• The Real Estate bank is one of four state owned special purpose banks in Iraq established in 1948. It is a\nCentral Bank of Iraq (CBI) fund that provides long term financing to private banks which, in turn, can offer\nhousing loans to individual clients. In 2021, the REB was recapitalized with IQD 1 trillion ($685 USD million)\n(CBI, 2021) and the Iraqi government announced a new lending initiative for the purchase and construction\nof homes. The loans provided are interest free with a repayment period of 20 years. The government also\nannounced that all interest on past and current loans were to be cancelled.\n• The National Housing fund (NHF) was established in 2004 under the Ministry of Construction and Housing\nto provide small and short-term loans to low- or middle-income borrowers who formally own a plot of land\nand wish to build on it. In February 2021, the Fund was also recapitalized with IQD 900 billion (USD $616\nmillion) (CBI, 2021) and the MOCH launched a new housing initiative through the NHF for the construction\n\n22\nof new housing, or the purchase of units. The loans are interest free, with a one-time administrative fee of\n5 percent of the loan value, and a repayment period of up to 20 years. Recent reports indicate that the loan\namounts fall far short of the market price, though 103,000 loans had been issued and 104 apartment\ncomplexes have been financed across fourteen governorates as of July 2022.\nMost available loans are provided to public sector employees (or those for whom they can act as a guarantor), for\nwhom collateral and income verification is obtainable. In general, access to home loans tend to benefit middle-\nincome groups as opposed to the lower income groups. Private sector housing finance does exist, but not to a\nsignificant extent. Loans from private banks are typically personal loans that are small in value and short-term. Iraq\nbanks provide very limited services, primarily limited to conventional cash transfers.\nThe housing shortage (estimated at up to 3.5 million units) is such that there is still a large effective demand amongst\nclients who do not need to rely on housing finance. The constraint on offtake will only be felt by existing developers\nwhen the pool of such clients shrinks down. This constraint, however, is a barrier to entry to more players who could\nfind in lower-income households a market they could serve.\nCommercial lending is also limited. State-owned and private banks do offer loans but at very high interest rates and\nare often fully securitized, requiring a guarantor. Instead, entrepreneurs often borrow from family and friends. None\nof the construction and real estate companies interviewed relied on construction finance from banks, either public\nor private. The construction financing that is available through government-led initiatives is reserved for well-\nconnected investors.\n5 \nThis constitutes a major barrier to entry for new players and a constraint to the development\nof MSMEs.\nProject activities directly related to the development of relevant financial instruments and support for regulatory\nreform and sector development will help to address the challenges that both homebuyers and MSMEs in\nconstruction face in accessing finance.\nSkills and labour\nWhile labour is available, skill shortages hinder employment and housing construction. Employers have identified\npotential skill gaps for bricklayers and stonemasons, carpenters and joiners, and concrete workers, as well as for\ncartographers and surveyors, construction managers, and mechanical engineering technicians (UNESCO, 2019).\nContractors hire local labour (Iraqis or refugees and migrants present in Iraq) because it is available and because\nthey must meet the minimum requirement for Iraqi workers. They also hire locally based foreign workers as they\nask for lower wages than Iraqi workers and are perceived as being easier to manage and less demanding. Contractors\nhire workers internationally when they require specific skills not available locally (to construct high-rise buildings in\nErbil, for instance) or when a foreign company brings its staff to the project site. This can, however, be constrained\nby regulatory restrictions on the recognition, access, and operation of foreign professionals in the architecture and\nengineering sectors. These restrictions may hinder efforts to fill skills gaps in the near-term and to develop the\ncapacities of local workers through skills transfers from experts. Limited knowledge and skills on the adoption of\nnew technologies and sustainable construction limit the potential to improve housing.\nArchitects have somewhat limited involvement in the housing sector, affecting the quality of construction. The legal\nrequirement to have an architect sign off on construction plans before they are approved by the municipality is not\nalways respected. Developers sometimes choose to save on costs and buy plans from architects that were not drawn\nspecifically for their project. This affects design negatively, both in terms of quality and creativity. There is no Iraqi\nor local identity that shows on new constructions. Construction techniques haven’t changed in decades and there is\nvery little innovation used in construction.\n6\nCapacity development targeting firms and workers through the project will build skills for enhanced productivity and\nsector sustainability. Stronger coordination between firms and support for housing and employment programmes\nwill emphasise skill development to drive inclusive growth through the sector. As such, these activities will contribute\nto the goals of the EU-funded TVET Reform Project, which aims to improve the effectiveness of the technical and\n5 \nStakeholder interviews.\n6 \nIbid.\n\n23\nvocational education and training system in Iraq through work on the TVET governance model, increasing the\nemployment of young Iraqis, establishing sectorial councils, and alignment with international standards. First\nlaunched in 2014, the TVET Reform Project is being implemented by UNESCO.\nMaterials\nWhile domestic manufacturing is considerable, construction materials are often imported to reduce costs or to\naccess specific products not made locally, particularly finishing materials for larger development projects. Iraqi\nimports of articles of stone, plaster, cement, asbestos, mica or similar materials (HS 68), for example, were worth\nUSD 252.7 million in 2022. Iraq has large construction material manufacturing capacities. Input materials to build\nthe foundations are mostly supplied by local producers.\n7 \nThey include cement, gravel, sand, blocks and bricks. There\nare 31 cement plants in Iraq (27 integrated and 4 grinding plants).\n8 \nState control of the sector is significant. SOEs\naccount for a large share of domestic production and the tight control of trade policies gives the government\ndominance over construction sub-sectors as it chooses the suppliers and subsequently the cost and quality of the\ngoods to be sold (UNESCO, 2019a).\nMaterials are imported from many different countries but mainly from neighbouring Iran and Turkey, as well as\nEurope. The recent ISIS conflict resulted in significant production losses coupled with intensive housing damage in\naffected areas resulting in a greater necessity to import a larger share of manufactured products. Imported materials\ndo not always meet quality standards. Imports enter the Iraqi market relatively easily, but quality controls at the\ndifferent points of entry are not systematic, either because of the large amounts to be controlled or because of\ncorruption.\n9\nThe cost of imported construction materials creates uncertainty and is a significant factor behind the high costs of\nhousing in Iraq. The cost of imports varies with the exchange rate and the IQD continues to be volatile. As many\nmaterials are imported, the devaluation of the IQD has increased the cost of construction. In Erbil, construction\ncompanies that had signed contracts with locked-in prices suffered from price increases and had to deliver at a lower\nmargin or at a loss (especially on Government contracts as there was no flexibility to revise the terms of the\ncontracts). Developers, on the other hand, were not much impacted by increases in the IQD cost of imported\nmaterials as their sale prices were denominated in US dollars, thus passing on the exchange rate risk to the home\nbuyer.\nBeyond exchange rate uncertainty, the prices of many building materials are affected by global trends. For instance,\nsteel used to be imported from Ukraine. After February 2022, supply from Ukraine was interrupted, creating a\ndisruption on the market. The cost of materials can also vary based on the (formal and informal) tariffs paid at the\nborder, which can vary widely at the discretion of the controller and between points of entry. Some points of entry\nare controlled by the Government and others are controlled by militias. Volatile prices in construction materials can\nbe particularly challenging for smaller firms to manage, as they are less likely to hold large inventories, purchase in\nbulk or hold sufficient cash reserves.\nConstruction sector structure\nWhile there are many firms of all sizes active in Iraq’s construction sector, limited capacities at the firm level and\nlittle coordination between these actors limits their potential and contributes to poor housing quality and high\nprices. The construction sector is dominated by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the majority of which\nare individual businesses, and to a lesser degree, conglomerates. MSMEs face several constraints in scaling up\nbusiness in Iraq due to factors such as lack of available finance that supports business expansion or construction\nfinance, expensive and arduous bureaucratic and administrative constraints including registering land and obtaining\npermits, and a fragmented marketplace. Many smaller businesses operate informally and lack of compliance with\n7 \nA list of manufacturers of construction materials can be found at https://www.zoominfo.com/companies-search/location-iraq-\nindustry-building-materials\n8 \nhttps://www.cemnet.com/global-cement-report/country/iraq\n9 \nStakeholder interviews.\n\n24\nbuilding codes and other regulations is common. As a result of the weak linkages between firms, it is difficult to share\nmarket information, spread innovation and good practices (including on enhancing sustainability in construction),\nand cooperate on larger projects. Recent challenges have further complicated this context; construction section\nproductivity and value added declined during the ISIS conflict.\nGiven the scale of their involvement in the sector, improved cooperation with foreign-owned firms and enhanced\ncompetitiveness relative to these firms stands to benefit domestically-owned MSMEs. The housing sector has been\none of the biggest draws of foreign investment into KRI, where foreign companies completed 21% of the total\nconstructed area in 2018 (KSRO, 2020). Across the country, foreign construction firms such as KBR Inc. and Hanwha\nEngineering and Construction are active in Iraq and are particularly involved in larger projects.\nConstruction firms are either hired directly by households or a contractor hired by the household (in the “owner-\nbuilder” model) or build larger projects for sale. The former limits the potential of businesses to scale up production,\nwhile the latter tends to cater to upper-income households and produces very little rental housing. Larger private\nprojects require a license from the National Investment Commission or KRI National Investment Board. Then, the\nMOCH assigns the land, and the contractor can begin the project. Most Investment projects are awarded to select\nlarge developers often foreign entities. For small private individual projects, households contract out or carry out\nthe projects on their own. Contracting out typically involves small contractors responsible for buying materials,\nemploying workers, and securing building permits and permissions on an individual basis. Despite significant\ndeveloper incentives and soft subsidies, these larger developments remain overly expensive for most middle- and\nlower-income households.\nIncreased private sector investment will be a key driver for growing the construction sector – and housing sector\nmore generally – in Iraq and is needed to support the adoption of new technologies and sustainable business models,\nimprove efficiency, generate employment, and improve housing quality and affordability. While Iraq has adopted\nlegal and regulatory reforms to encourage foreign investment and improve the business climate, including through\nthe promulgation of the Investment Law and the National Investment Commission (NIC), there still remain significant\nchallenges in terms of the administrative and procedural framework that make it difficult to attract and retain\ninvestors into these sectors. The bureaucracy attached to obtaining licenses, land and permits which can take several\nyears (Al-Mawlawi, 2019), complexity and lack of clarity in regulations, unpredictability of the policy environment,\nand lack of coordination among government agencies are all factors that complicate the existing investment\nenvironment.\nThe government is directly involved in only a small fraction of housing construction, typically intended for public\nemployees. Public construction projects are first proposed by a public entity such as the MOCH and then requires\nthe approval of the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Finance, the latter of which provides the required funds\nfor the project. The contract is then awarded to a state-owned company or a private contractor, and each\nadministration monitors their select construction projects. Although there are a number of state-owned\nconstruction firms in Iraq, private businesses are responsible for most value added in the sector. Public tenders are\noften affected by lengthy project delays, high construction costs, and a lack of local materials and skilled workers.\nFrom an administrative perspective, public tenders entail complicated bureaucratic processes, and a lack of\ncoordinated planning further aggravated by budget shortfalls which also greatly impedes the sector’s productivity.\nCorruption is another important factor; public projects are often awarded through nepotism resulting in poor quality\nor incomplete projects. Consequentially, there is a high level of mistrust in the government within the construction\nsector due to a long track record of delayed payments, stalled projects, procurement opacity, and the absence of\ncontract guarantees.\nCurrent policies and practices are also widely perceived to be insufficient to address the threats from climate and\nother natural disasters, for example. The incorporation of green or sustainable elements in construction is rare, but\nthere is potential to develop this further. The importance of construction standards was made clear recently by the\nearthquake that hit Turkey and Syria and destroyed thousands of homes.\nSmall businesses in the materials and construction sectors will benefit from their involvement in the project’s\nassistance on affordable housing and sector development, which includes firm-level capacity development and\n\n25\nenhanced sector coordination. Support for skill development in the sector will similarly contribute to addressing\nthese challenges.\nMaintenance and renovation\nMaintenance and renovation costs can be significant and have been cited as a major contributor to the current\ndilapidated state of the existing housing stock by multiple stakeholders. Homeowners often rebuild their houses\nafter ten years or so in order to better adapt the structure to their needs, as the original designs are often not well\nsuited to the demands of the owners. Renovations are also motivated by the rapid deterioration of construction, a\nresult of poor maintenance and the poor quality of the initial construction. For example, in two (low-rise) residential\ncomplexes built by developers visited in Erbil, most houses were identical, but a few were distinct, having already\nbeen rebuilt by their owners.\nMany of the high rises built in previous decades face neglect and deterioration. Large residential developments\nrequire more complex operations and management systems. Stakeholders believe such management tools are\ncurrently lacking on the market, which will lead to their quick deterioration. To better support the entire building\nlife cycle – from planning to construction – and continuing maintenance and operations, Building Information\nModelling (BIM) has been proposed as an internationally recognized and useful tool to support cost savings,\nreductions in construction duration, and increased building performance in the architectural, engineering and\nconstruction (AEC) sectors. BIM is a project management platform that includes a suite of software tools that can\nintegrate data sets for multiple project tasks into 3D models, and functions as a collaborative platform that connects\nall project parties.\nWhile retrofits to the existing housing stock to mitigate climate impacts and adapt to climate risks are needed,\ninsufficient capacities and the lack of effective price signalling for homeowners further reduce the sustainability of\nIraqi housing. The project’s support for a strengthened construction sector will create opportunities for additional\ninvestment in maintenance and renovation.\n\n26\n4. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION\nAgainst the backdrops discussed under the problem analysis section, the proposed project aims to stimulate decent\nwork opportunities for young women and men while addressing urgent need for affordable housing, especially for\nlower income and vulnerable people in Iraq. Action on job creation through affordable housing construction involves\nimplementing specific strategies and initiatives. The project seeks to introduce a public works programme\ncomplementing support for addressing existing gaps within the Government and the private sector through\nEmployment Intensive Investment Programme (EIIP) initiative. Furthermore, it aims to improve access to adequate\nand sustainable housing to create better living conditions for low-income and vulnerable populations; and build the\ncapacities of the housing sector – including government actors and micro, small and medium enterprises, and civil\nsociety organizations – as a driver of economic growth.\nThe proposed actions will foster the following key elements while realizing the desired outcomes of the project:\nInvestment in affordable housing projects: Governments, both at the local and national levels, allocate funds for\nthe development of affordable housing projects. These funds come from public budgets, private investments, or a\ncombination of both. Allocating resources to affordable housing construction creates a demand for labour and\nmaterials, generating jobs in the construction sector.\nPublic-Private partnerships: Encourage public-private partnerships which allows collaboration between\ngovernment agencies and private developers as well as MSMEs involved in the housing sector. These partnerships\ncan help leverage private sector expertise and funding while ensuring that affordable housing remains a priority.\nSuch collaborations can lead to more significant housing developments, translating into more and better job\nopportunities.\nDiverse job opportunities: Affordable housing construction does not only create direct jobs but also generates\nindirect and induced employment opportunities in related industries like architecture, engineering, real estate,\nfinance, and property management. Fostering a diverse job market can lead to a more sustainable and robust local\neconomy.\nStreamlining regulatory and legal frameworks permitting processes: Facilitating revisions to the legislative and\npolicy framework that better enables affordable housing delivery including simplifying and expediting permitting\nprocesses can speed up construction timelines and reduce development costs. This can create a conducive\nenvironment for builders, attracting more investments and subsequently generating employment in the\nconstruction sector.\nBuilding affordable housing technical competency for government officials: Capacity development of government\nactors, both at the national and governorate level, can support in building the skills and aptitude necessary for\nbuilding an integrated affordable housing ecosystem, including developing effective policies and programs based on\nsound rules and regulations, administrative and compliance procedures, sound planning, and feasible finance\nmechanisms.\nUpdating the National Housing Policy: Updating the NHP can help build knowledge and evidence-based regarding\nIraq’s current housing challenges, which will in turn support in building a concise and comprehensive road map to\naddress these complex challenges.\nCapacity building and skill development for local businesses: Investing in skills development for MSMEs and\nentrepreneurs in the housing and construction sector can improve the quality of labour available for affordable\nhousing projects. By providing MSMEs with specialized skills and certifications, they become more efficient and\neffective to create employment opportunities and can contribute to the successful completion of housing\ndevelopments integrating green and innovative practices.\nPromoting small and women-owned businesses: Encouraging the participation of small and women-owned\nbusinesses in affordable housing projects create economic opportunities for underrepresented groups, especially\n\n27\nwomen, who represent low rate of participation in the labour market. Policies and regulatory framework that\nprioritize women to participate in the labour market stimulate job creation and support local economies.\nSocial partners engagement: Involving workers’ and employers’ organizations in the planning and construction of\naffordable housing have multiple benefits. It helps to advocate for workers’ rights at work and build trust with\nemployers and government counterparts at national and local level. It also creates a fertile ground for effective social\ndialogue and collective bargaining.\nClimate change: Addressing climate change through the construction of sustainable affordable homes that are\ndenser and located in compact communities thereby utilizing land and infrastructure more efficiently, and which\nintegrates climate sensitive design principals and energy efficiency measures will support in raising environmental\nawareness and enable testing innovative and sustainable housing solutions specific to the Iraqi climate context. As\nthe world transitions to a more sustainable future, the construction industry can be a significant driver of change.\nBy advocating for and facilitating the adoption of environmentally friendly construction practices, such as green\nbuilding technologies and materials, the project can help create new opportunities for decent work. Simultaneously,\ninvesting in the training and upskilling of construction workers to meet the demands of the green economy can\nensure that these jobs not only contribute to environmental sustainability but also offer fair wages, safe working\nconditions, and social protection. The project can act as a bridge between governments, employers, and workers in\nthe construction sector, fostering social dialogue and cooperation to develop policies and practices that\nsimultaneously address climate change challenges and promote the creation of quality employment opportunities.\n4.1 THEORY OF CHANGE\nIF the alignment of national policies and regulations with international labour standards and their enforcement in\nthe construction sector, including on eliminating child labour (Oc.1) and green affordable housing and decent\nemployment in Iraq (Oc. 2) will be increased; and, IF the business environment and participation of local MSMEs and\ninvestors in the construction sector will be improved (Oc. 3), while the influence on labour markets of employers’\nand workers’ organisations involved in social dialogue with the government will be also strengthened (Oc. 4), then\ndecent work and improved living conditions, including for the most vulnerable, will be supported in Iraq (Impact),\nas long as the political and economic situation in Iraq is stable; there is no epidemic outbreak; there is no climatic\ndisturbances preventing the growth and expansion of selected value chain; a political commitment exists to enacting\npolicy reforms, implement PWP and National Housing Policy; the investment in affordable and green\nhousing; national beneficiaries introduce recommendations developed under the programme in their institutions\nand working procedures; GoI has political will and commitment towards strengthening social partners.\n4.2 PROJECT IMPACT\nThe overall impact of the project is to stimulate decent work and improve living conditions, including for the most\nvulnerable, in Iraq. The objective is aligned with the EU Action Document (NDICI ASIA/2021/043-218) - Support to\ndurable solutions for Iraq’s displaced populations: integration into the national labour market and national systems\nfor education and social protection and its specific objective 1.1: promote an economic transformation that creates\ndecent jobs and increases productive capacity.\n4.3 RESULTS CHAIN OUTCOME ONE\n4.3.1 OUTCOME ONE: INTERVENTION LOGIC\nIf the capacities of ministerial and decentralised actors for Public Works Programme design and implementation are\nimproved by also integrating Employment Intensive Approaches focusing on the housing sector (Op 1.1); if the\ninstitutional capacity for policy development, enforcement, and coordination to fight against child labour in the\nconstruction sector with focus on the brick industry, protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working\nenvironments for all workers including young people, women and IDPs is improved (Op 1.2); if the capacities of GoI\nand women for the integration of women and girls empowerment, equality and non-discrimination at policy level\nand the workplace are also improved (Op. 1.3), then the alignment of national policies and regulations with\n\n28\ninternational labour standards and their enforcement in the construction sector, including on eliminating child\nlabour will be increased (Oc1), as long as the government is committed to absorb capacities created on PWP and to\nimplement effectively; national coordination and strategic partnership work in harmony for child labour policy\ndevelopment, implementation, and monitoring; relevant ministries and social partners representatives are\ncommitted and willing to engage in OSH policy/strategy development, implementation, and capacity building\ntraining programmes; and, GoI both in Federal and KRG is politically committed to ratify Convention 190.\n4.3.2 OUTCOME ONE: DESCRIPTION\nImproved alignment of national policies and regulations with international labour standards and their\nenforcement in the construction sector, including on eliminating child labour.\nThe creation of a public work programme in Iraq is highlighted as a priority for both economic reform and sustainable\ndevelopment. In the White Paper on Economic Reform adopted by the Government of Iraq in 2020, the Government\nhighlights the ambition of “creating legal and regulatory frameworks needed to operationalize public works\nprogrammes”, under the second axis focusing on macroeconomic reform and employment creation (GoI, 2020: p.\n62). Here, public works are seen as a means of creating sustainable employment opportunities - particularly for low-\nincome households, those on low pay, or the unemployed - on the one hand, and of contributing to local\ndevelopment and infrastructure through small, locally defined projects on the other. Similarly, the Iraq Vision for\nSustainable Development 2030, as drafted in 2019 by the Ministry of Planning, also identifies the establishment of\npublic works as one of the key investment pillars to create job opportunities in the immediate term, in recognition\nthat initiatives and policies to foster job creation in the private sector are more likely to bear fruit in the medium- to\nlong-term (GOI, 2019). Most recently, in November 2022, the new government under its Development Programme\nhas shown interest to invest and implement in National Public Works Programme, especially in the housing and\nconstruction sector.\nA range of humanitarian and development actors have been implementing cash-for-work programmes across Iraq\nfor several years now though the interventions vary in their design and objectives, including in terms of targeting.\nWithin this context, a PWP is indeed a key tool for the government to create employment in the immediate term to\ncomplement the clear gaps in employment creation in the private sector.\nUnder this outcome, the ILO, leveraging its vast experience in designing and implementing PWP, is planning to\nmainstream the Employment Intensive Investment Programme (EIIP) and Local Resource Based (LRB) approaches\nwith gender responsiveness and sustainable financing mechanisms within the National Public Works Programme\nwhich is planned to be designed and piloted in the selected two governorates of Iraq. Besides identifying sustainable\nsources of financing, this would require initiating evidence generation, assessments, and analyses to inform\nprogramme design parameters and implementation modalities, along with drafting and adopting key policies,\nStandard Operation Procedures (SOPs), and implementation guidelines. Additionally, these processes will need to\ngo hand in hand with core capacity-strengthening activities both at national and sub-national levels to strengthen\nthe ability of the government to effectively implement the programme, in coordination with UN-Habitat and ITC\nwith expertise in the housing and construction sector. This will entail enhanced investment opportunity to achieve\nsustainable and long-term impacts on employment, economic growth, and poverty reduction.\nIn parallel to the above, the core component of outcome 1 includes technical support to the government in fighting\nagainst child labour, labour governance, and gender equality in the housing and construction sector.\n4.3.3 OUTCOME ONE: OUTPUTS AND ACTIVITIES\nOutput 1.1: Improved capacities of ministerial and decentralised actors for Public Works Programme design and\nimplementation integrating Employment Intensive Approaches focusing on the housing sector.\nUnder output 1.1, the ILO will provide technical support to developing Public Works Programme through\nEmployment Intensive Investment Programme (EIIP). The approaches used at the EIIP focus on strengthening and\nempowering institutions to create an enabling environment for socio-economic recovery and development through\n\n29\npolicies that promote decent work at public infrastructure delivery. The ILO will act as a technical facilitator for public\nand private sector sectors to effectively plan, design, and implement EIIP interventions for providing developing\nsustainable infrastructure and productive employment opportunities. The ILO offers technical assistance to relevant\nministries and local authorities to develop their capacity in mainstreaming employment-intensive approaches. Such\nassistance includes assessing the employment potential of existing programmes, reviewing procurement processes,\ndeveloping technical guidelines, conducting technical trainings, and promoting community involvement.\nFurthermore, the ILO under this output will be working across three dimensions: policy, institutional capacity, and\ndirect implementation.\nThe policy work will ensure the inclusion of decent work principles; Local-Resources based approaches; gender\nresponsiveness; and sustainable financing and procurement mechanisms. Specific construction sector will be\nfocused on, such as the bricks manufacturing within housing sector.\nIn addition, the ILO will develop operational tools and guidelines to implement and monitor the public work\nprogramme with a focus on infrastructural interventions in the housing sector adopting EI Approaches.\nOn implementation/ demonstration level, the EIIP approaches will be integrated into the construction interventions\nunder the housing sector including the relevant infrastructure around housing. Also building local capacities through\ndifferent training activities targets the local governmental partners and implementing agencies and private sector\ncontractors.\nThe quantification of created jobs in the project has been highlighted by the EU as the key indicative result to\nstrengthen the business case of the investment. Therefore, the ILO will lead the process of quantifying and reporting\nemployment impact through EIIP monitoring and impact assessment processes.\nActivities Narrative\nActivity 1.1.1: Support government to elaborate a policy and coordination structures for public works programme\nensuring decent job creation and integrating Employment Intensive Investment Programme (EIIP) approaches;\nLocal Resource Based (LRB) approaches; gender responsiveness; and sustainable financing mechanisms.\nThe project will: Stakeholder Engagement: Convene a multi-stakeholder working group comprising government\nofficials, representatives from workers' and employers' organizations, civil society, and experts in employment-\nintensive approaches.

The necessity to rapidly bolster\nhousing production and ensure Iraqi’s have access to adequate housing is clearly articulated in multiple national\nplans, including Iraq’s Vision 2030, the National Housing Policy, National Development Plans, the Poverty Reduction\nStrategy, and the National Plan for Reconstruction and Development Framework. Within these agendas the\nimperative to address the inadequate supply of housing is fully recognized and ambitious targets have been set, but\nunfortunately, efforts continue to fall short of intentions due to the multitude of intertwined and ongoing\nimpediments previously mentioned.\nIn this respect, this outcome aims to build the knowledge base of the Iraqi government to effectively tackle the\ncomplexity of housing challenges as the country transitions to a long-term development agenda. A central aspect of\nthis outcome is that it is not only intended to build the skills and tools necessary to formulate effective policies and\nprograms but also to heighten the political awareness on the necessity to rapidly address the affordable housing\ndeficit and the imperative for government to invest accordingly. At the core of this outcome, lies a ‘learn by doing’\nmodel whereby UN-Habitat will assume a technical assistance role, in effort to transfer the knowledge, skills and\ncapacity to GOI counterparts through a mentorship approach. Achieving this goal will require intensive collaboration\nand a strong commitment from the government to actively engage in these endeavours.\nUN-Habitat’s support will adopt an ecosystem approach, whereby the proposed outputs and activities seek to\naddress housing holistically namely, through- policy, planning, finance, governance, housing development, and\naddressing climate change. The outputs themselves, represent a continuum of activities where ultimately green\nsocial housing units are constructed through two pilot projects, which in collaboration with ILO and ITC will produce\ndecent jobs and bolster the capacity of MSMEs. Tapping into UN-Habitat’s vast experience in housing and sustainable\ndevelopment, the proposed project activities will aid the GOI in building the foundation necessary for building\neffective affordable housing programs and enabling private investment to support these activities. Furthermore, the\nproject in its entirety, will directly address the impact of housing on climate change and will raise environmental\nawareness at institutional and community levels. The project will introduce climate adaptation and mitigation\nmeasures into the green social housing units and will demonstrate proof of concept for future green housing efforts.\n4.4.3 OUTCOME TWO: OUTPUTS AND ACTIVITIES\nOutput 2.1: Increased awareness and capacities of local, provincial, and national government staff on affordable\nhousing planning and policy.\nUnder output 2.1, UN-Habitat will provide capacity building and technical assistance support to government\ncounterparts to build sufficient institutional competency to fully address affordable housing challenges in Iraq. UN-\nHabitat will provide hands-on trainings that address the many facets of housing including but not limited to:\nunderstanding the SDGs and other global agendas, principles of sustainable development, land management\nstrategies, strategic affordable housing planning, policy and program development, fundamentals of green\nsustainable housing, housing and land finance tools, development finance, housing norms and standards, and\nunderstanding basic housing economics including supply and demand principles.\nThe aim of this output is to support in building the knowledge base necessary for the government to effectively\ntackle Iraq’s affordable housing challenges independently and for the long-term. The output also aims to facilitate\nthe Government’s commitment to invest in affordable housing through building a stronger foundation to better\ncomprehend and address the myriad of housing challenges. Capacity building will also focus on government enabling\napproaches to support a better functioning housing sector as a whole, including enabling private sector investment\nwhich can facilitate a more productive and sustainable housing market. Recipients of capacity building will be\ntargeted toward government staff involved in housing activities including ministries and directorates, at the national,\ngovernorate, and local levels. Furthermore, capacity building will mainstream climate action throughout the training\ncurriculum to ensure addressing climate challenges is fully integrated into all aspects of addressing the housing\necosystem. All efforts will also be made to ensure inclusion of women in all activities as well as the inclusion of\nvulnerable populations.\nFollowing the series of trainings and workshops, ongoing dialogue and continued knowledge exchange will be\nsupported through a peer exchange platform. UN-Habitat will deploy a web-based tool where participants can\n\n38\ncontinue to tap into UN-Habitat expertise and stay connected to their peers. In this respect, a mutual support\nnetwork is created and the opportunity for continued learning and exchange can extend beyond the trainings and\nproject duration.\nUN-Habitat will use a combination of consultancy services and staff time and expertise to develop topical training\nmodules relevant to Iraqi capacity needs and for the delivery of trainings. Six to eight half day interactive training\nmodules (amounting to a 3-4 day training course) will be developed. Training materials may be adapted so that they\ncan be delivered to both national and provincial government staff or other stakeholder groups.\nUnder Output 2.1, efforts will also be made to support the MoCH in updating the National Housing Policy to better\nreflect Iraq’s current housing situation and to build a cross-sectoral and multi-stakeholder roadmap to effectively\naddress Iraq’s entrenched housing challenges in the future. The first Iraq National Housing Policy (INHP) was\nlaunched by the Ministry of Construction and Housing (MOCH) in 2010 with support from UN-Habitat to address the\nmultitude of housing issues facing the country and to develop actionable steps to remedy the situation. In 2017, the\npolicy was updated which included an assessment of the 2010 policy progress. The policy update concluded that\nlittle had been accomplished as intended due to lack of sufficient stakeholder coordination and the rapid social and\neconomic changes that occurred during this period (2010-2015).\nGiven the vast changes that have of occurred since 2017, including recent economic shocks, the rapid expansion of\ninformal settlements, a precipitously escalating housing deficit, and the advent and impact of the COVID pandemic,\nan update to the Policy is needed. An updated policy will evaluate the progress made since 2017 including more\nrecent government actions to address housing such as the expansion of loans available to homebuyers and the\nprogress the GOI has made in developing an enabling private sector approach through the National Investment\nCommission, including the extent to which it has contributed to affordable housing, if at all. An important step in\nbuilding a robust housing ecosystem is to examine recent policy and programme effectiveness as well as continued\ngaps in addressing housing so that corrective courses or new actions can be developed to address Iraq’s persistent\nhousing challenges more effectively and target available resources accordingly.\nIn this respect, UN-Habitat will support MoCH in updating the National Housing Policy which better reflects upon\nand addresses current realities. The update will take a pro-poor and rights-based approach that reflects human rights\nprinciples including the right to adequate housing. In this respect, the need to address housing challenges faced by\nlow-income and vulnerable populations will be a central to the National Housing Policy update.\nFor the National Housing Policy update, UN-Habitat will contract with an International Housing Policy consultant and\ntap into project staff expertise to provide ample technical assistance to MOCH to undergo a comprehensive policy\nupdate that reflects more current housing realities in Iraq at present. UN-Habitat staff will closely coordinate with\nMOCH to ensure they commit staff and resources to the policy update, and ensure they are fully dedicated to taking\non a leadership role in the process.\nActivities Narrative\nActivity 2.1.1: Conduct capacity gap analysis to assess the awareness, knowledge, and skills on topics related to\naffordable housing planning and programming at applicable levels of government.\nA capacity gap analysis will be conducted to assess the awareness, knowledge, and skills on topics related to\naffordable housing planning and programming at applicable levels of government. UN-Habitat will issue a\nquestionnaire, with the support of MoCH, to government staff involved in housing policy and programs to identify\nthe most pertinent capacity gaps. The questionnaire will help to determine appropriate topics to be covered in\ncapacity building training sessions. UN-Habitat will also pursue government consultations with higher-level officials\nto determine the perceived institutional level capacity gaps. The capacity gap analysis will help to gauge a baseline\nunderstanding of housing related competencies and determine appropriate methods to calibrate the level of\ntechnical difficulty, accordingly. The capacity gap analysis may also identify that multiple trainings on one specific\nsubject is necessary to achieve core competencies. In this respect, the capacity gap analysis will help to formulate\nthe specifics of the trainings to be delivered both in terms of relevance of subject matter, as well as, as the breadth\nand depth to be covered. The capacity gap analysis will be conducted during the inception phase of the project to\n\n39\nsupport in further determining the appropriate locations and number of trainings sessions to be provided. This\nactivity will include a particular focus on equity and inclusion of women, and vulnerable populations.\nActivity 2.1.2: Devise affordable housing capacity building training modules.\nTopical hands-on capacity building training modules will be devised based on the gap analysis. These modules will\ncover a range of housing topics such as: planning and building norms and standards, housing development finance,\nprogram development and implementation, environmental design, green building codes and energy performance.\nDevelopment of modules will tap into UN-Habitat’s vast resource library and expertise in urban planning, land\nmanagement and housing topics. After the identification of capacity needs, UN-Habitat will issue TOR(s) for\nconsultancy services to develop and deliver capacity building trainings. The capacity gap analysis will support in\ndetermining suitable subject matters as well as identifying the most suitable delivery modalities, quantity of training\nsessions required, and the appropriate level of external support needed to successfully delivery effective capacity\nbuilding training sessions. Training modules will be interactive and include opportunities for active dialogue, hands-\non exercises, and resources for continued learning. The training modules will cover an array of housing topics and\nwill be designed to be relevant to a diversity of participants.\nActivity 2.1.3: Delivery of capacity development trainings to relevant Ministry staff and local authorities on pre-\nidentified housing topics with deliberate focus on climate change, gender inclusion and developing sustainable\nmodels for supporting internally displaced populations.\nUN-Habitat will deliver a series of instructor-led capacity development trainings to relevant Ministry staff and local\nauthorities on pre-identified housing topics. In coordination with government counterparts, training locations and\nrecipients will be identified. UN-Habitat and MOCH will be responsible for identifying participants, distributing\ninvitations, tracking participation, and in ensuring acceptable levels of participation. UN-Habitat will arrange all\nlogistics including identification and scheduling of training venue, technical and equipment needs, and all training\nmaterials – agendas, worksheets, presentations, etc. Trainings will take place over 3-4 days and will be delivered by\nUN-Habitat staff and/or the consultants responsible for devising the training modules. It is anticipated that 6-8 - ½\nday training modules will be devised and delivered in whole, in a minimum of three locations to housing Ministry\nand Directorate staff. UN-Habitat will also garner feedback and distribute and collect training evaluations from\nparticipants to determine any needed revisions or alterations for future training sessions. This will also aid in\ncompiling lessons learned and understanding any necessary corrective courses actions needed, as well as for\nmeeting M&E reporting requirements.\nActivity 2.1.4: Provide ongoing support and technical assistance through establishing open communication\nchannels that facilitates continued peer-to-peer dialogue and support from UN-Habitat and other housing experts\nthroughout the duration of the project.\nA knowledge exchange software platform will be identified and procured to support continued dialogue for training\nparticipants. This will entail careful evaluation of available software for appropriateness in supporting this type of\ndialogue including its key functionality. Desirable software features would include the capacity to build a resource\nrepository, seamless chat mechanisms, calendar of events, and the capacity to collaborate on documents. The\nplatform will also serve as a repository for the training modules including video archives of the trainings delivered,\nfor quick reference. Based on previous project experience, cost-effective off the shelf software is widely available in\nthe marketplace that would adequately suit this purpose. This activity will facilitate ongoing support and technical\nassistance from UN-Habitat and other project experts through establishing open communication channels. It will\nalso foster continued peer-to-peer dialogue and knowledge exchange. UN-Habitat project staff will be responsible\nfor software set-up, participant engagement, moderation and in prompting ongoing dialogue. UN-Habitat will also\ncontinuously populate the platform with project updates, new housing related research or publications, event\nnotifications and other relevant information to keep participants actively engaged. The platform will be open to not\njust to training participants, but all Iraqi government staff interested in engaging housing policy dialogue.\nActivity 2.1.5: Provide technical assistance to the GOI in conducting baseline research for National Housing Policy\nUpdate.\n\n40\nFor the National Housing Policy Update, UN-Habitat will contract with an International Housing Policy Expert to\nprovide technical assistance to MOCH in delivering an updated policy. The updated National Housing Policy will build\noff previous policies (2009/2017) and will take a particular interest in addressing affordable housing need. A baseline\nstudy will include an assessment and documentation of progress made on the previous National Housing Policies\nincluding key achievements, challenges, and bottlenecks to implementation. Furthermore, building off recent\nresearch conducted by UN-Habitat for the EU in 2023 the update will start with a base line of Iraq’s current housing\nsituation including any available updated data, research, and an evaluation of current initiatives to address housing\nchallenges. The research will incorporate an analysis of success and challenges and the extent to which government\ninvestment has achieved its objectives and intended targets.\nActivity 2.1.6: Provide technical assistance in GOI in devising and executing stakeholder engagement plan.\nThe foundation of the Housing Policy Update will be extensive engagement with various stakeholder groups. This\ncomprehensive approach will assure that the policy truly reflects the diversity of voices and interests necessary for\na holistic, inclusive and equitable housing policy. To achieve this, a variety of mechanisms will be employed to engage\na broad range of audiences. A comprehensive stakeholder engagement will be developed with to outline a clear\nstrategy for including various groups in policy dialogue. UN-Habitat will support the Ministry in stakeholder mapping\nand outreach through technical assistance support. The technical assistance approach is designed to enhance the\nMinistry’s capacity to develop inclusive and participatory approaches to policy development.\nA technical group working group will be established, comprised of national experts in housing construction, and real\nestate, and other housing related entities. The diverse group of experts will contribute their knowledge and expertise\nin guiding the policy formulation. The group will also be charged with engaging in a peer review and validation of\nthe final policy document. The technical work group will meet as needed (a minimum of three times) during the\npolicy update. Stakeholder engagement activities will include:\n- Consultations and Interviews: Extensive consultations will be conducted, involving interviews with key\nstakeholders from diverse backgrounds. These interviews will provide valuable insights and perspectives on\nhousing needs and challenges.\n- Roundtables and Plenary Discussions: Roundtable discussions and workshops will be organized to facilitate\nin-depth conversations among stakeholders. These forums will encourage collaborative problem-solving\nand idea sharing.\n- Participatory Planning Workshops: Participatory planning workshops will be organized with CSOs, NGOs,\ntrade groups, private sector representatives, financial institutions, and other stakeholder groups including\nvulnerable groups. These workshops will enable diverse perspectives, including those of women, youth, the\nelderly, disabled individuals, and other vulnerable populations, to be incorporated into the policy.\nAll feedback and insights gathered from stakeholders will be carefully collated. A structured process will be\nestablished to integrate these findings into the policy update, ensuring that it is truly representative of the needs\nand concerns of all stakeholders.\nActivity 2.1.7: Support the Ministry in drafting a revised NHP that clearly prioritizes proposed activities including\nconcrete implementation measures and entities responsible for implementation (including intergovernmental\ncoordination), with commensurate budget and resource allocation, benchmarking, and timeline for completion.\nUN-Habitat will provide support to the Ministry in the development of a revised National Housing Policy (NHP) that\nclearly articulates and prioritizes recommendations. This includes specifying concrete implementation measures and\nthe resources needs that are in alignment with the proposed activities, and identifying the responsible entities for\nimplementation, including intergovernmental coordination. The policy will clearly articulate a framework for\nachieving its goals in the short (1-2 years) – mid (5-10 years) – and long term (10 plus years)- including milestones,\nbenchmarks, and an action plan for completion.\nUN-Habitat's assistance will extend to supporting the Ministry in formulating recommendations for mainstreaming\nhousing into other national plans and sectoral strategies.\n\n41\nOnce the draft policy document is completed, validation workshops will be organized to assess the policy's findings\nand recommendations. These workshops will involve the technical working group and other stakeholders considered\nessential to ensure a comprehensive range of voices and perspectives are incorporated into the final policy\ndocument. These workshops will also support in prioritizing the proposed activities and in devising an actionable\nplan. Following the validation process and the compilation of valuable stakeholder input, UN-Habitat will continue\nto support the Ministry in finalizing the policy document and advocating for its full endorsement by the Cabinet of\nMinisters.\nOutput 2.2: Improved accessibility and awareness by the relevant public actors of the national regulatory and\nlegal framework applicable to green and affordable housing delivery\nUnder output 2.2, UN-Habitat, with the support of an International Housing Policy Expert consultant and in\npartnership with MoCH, will undertake a comprehensive assessment of the regulatory and legal framework related\nto green and affordable housing. The aim is to identify the necessary reforms required to enhance the facilitation of\ngovernment-supported green and affordable housing initiatives.\nMuch of Iraq's housing laws are outdated, lack specificity or are non-existent, particularly concerning green and\nsocial housing and other initiatives to address the housing needs of low-income and vulnerable populations. To\naddress these deficiencies, UN-Habitat and MoCH will engage in consultations with predefined stakeholders,\nincluding Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), financial institutions, Ministries, and Housing Directorates. These\nconsultations will help to discern the practical implications of existing rules and regulations—going beyond their\ntheoretical intent.\nDrawing insights from stakeholder interviews and document reviews, the assessment will encompass an evaluation\nof applicable laws and regulations, a comprehensive gap analysis, and the formulation of concrete recommendations\nfor revisions. Moreover, the assessment may identify legislative gaps and propose instruments to bridge these policy\ndeficiencies. This may include recommendations for the development of a National Housing Act or National Social\nHousing Regulation Act, or the establishment of processes to ensure fair and transparent beneficiary selection,\ncodified within the law.\nThe consolidated technical report will include the following components:\n1.) An inventory or existing rules and regulations applicable to public sector initiatives that support green\nand affordable housing delivery;\n2.) An assessment of existing rules and regulations to determine which laws impede or enable public\ninvestment in green and affordable housing;\n3.) Recommendations for revisions to specific laws and/ or the formulation of new laws or regulations.\nRecommendations will be vetted through a consultation process to validate findings.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 2.2.1: Collect and assess all applicable laws and regulations applicable to green and affordable housing\nand that regulate the activities and operations of the public sector\nThe first step of this activity will include building a repository of all applicable laws and regulations and translate\nfrom Arabic to English, if necessary. UN-Habitat project staff will be responsible for information collection in close\ncoordination with MoCH and other relevant ministries to ensure all related laws and regulations are collected. The\nOfficial Gazette of Iraq which is the official source for all laws and resolutions passed by COR since 1922 will be the\nprimary source to identify applicable housing laws. The collection of laws and regulation will also be done in concert\nwith ITC to avoid duplication of activities. One comprehensive database will be compiled and organized by subject\nmatter and serve as the information baseline for this output.\nActivity 2.2.2: Assess whether legislation is enabling or constraining development and/or the fulfilment of public\nsector supported green and affordable housing delivery (investment projects, social/public housing, etc.)\n\n42\nUN-Habitat project staff, with support from an international Housing Policy Expert consultant, will undertake an in-\ndepth analysis of the existing laws and regulations pertaining to the GOI’s authority to oversee and facilitate both\ngreen and affordable housing initiatives within the country. The assessment will comprehensively document all\nexisting legislation that enable the provision of environmentally sustainable and affordable housing and identify any\ngaps and deficiencies to the current legislative and regulatory framework. Additionally, the assessment will examine\nthe extent to which these legal frameworks promote, enforce, and monitor equality and non-discrimination,\nparticularly concerning gender-based considerations, within the housing sector (CLIP SO 3-2).\nIn addition to conducting a comprehensive review of applicable laws and regulations, and drawing upon other\npertinent research, this undertaking will encompass conducting stakeholder interviews. These interviews will\nprovide critical insights into the practical implications of these laws and the extent to which tangible barriers exist.\nStakeholders to be engaged in interviews may include government ministries, state-owned housing enterprises\n(SOEs), banks, financial institutions, planning authorities, and private developers or investors.\nThe overarching objective of this evaluation is to determine whether the existing rules and regulations either\nfacilitate or hinder the development and realization of green and affordable housing projects, as supported by\ngovernment policies and initiatives. This assessment will serve as a valuable reference tool, offering a clear and\ndetailed overview of the legal landscape in this regard.\nActivity 2.2.3: Draft recommendations for revisions to regulatory and legal framework in a technical report that\nwould better enable affordable housing policy and programme development\nUN-Habitat in close coordination with MOCH will then draft recommendations for necessary revisions to the\nregulatory and legal framework related to green and affordable housing. The activities under this output will be\nconsolidated into one technical report. The consolidated report will be vetted through expert technical reviews and\na validation workshop comprised of the stakeholders earlier consulted during the initial assessment activities. The\nfinal report will articulate how the existing framework could be improved to better enable public sector support for\naffordable and green housing development and delivery. Recommendations to remove gender-discriminatory\nclauses related to HLP (CLIP SO 3-2) including customary and traditional barriers to HLP rights will also be made, if\napplicable. Following final drafting of the report, UN-Habitat and MOCH will seek formal endorsement. UN-Habitat\nwill also support the MOCH in advocacy and building the political support necessary to realize the adoption of the\nnew or revised legislation and regulations contained within the report.\nOutput 2.3: Improved availability of financial tools and models for affordable housing applicable to the Iraqi\ncontext\nUnder output 2.3 UN-Habitat will support the GOI in developing sound financial mechanisms that will support the\nscaling up of affordable housing production in Iraq. Developing an affordable housing program entails many\ninterlinking factors, levels of government, and various sectors, and can be a tremendously intricate undertaking.\nHousing programmes must consider the options available to finance a project which often winds up in a complexity\nof layers involving both private and public capital as well as a mix of sources including loans, grants, and subsidies\nand at distinct stages of the development process including – preconstruction, construction, and ongoing operations\nand maintenance. Additionally, the level of subsidy required needs careful consideration; typically, the lower the\nincome group served, the deeper the required subsidy. Many good international examples exist of housing finance\nmodels that make housing projects financially feasible while also maximizing government resources. This output will\nengage international and national finance experts to develop new affordable housing finance models that are\nfeasible in the Iraqi context taking into strong consideration the country’s underdeveloped financial institutions and\nthe lacking capacity to deliver innovative lending models.\nDeveloping new financial tools in Iraq will require a nuanced understanding of the interplay between public and\nprivate sector actors in the delivery of housing and serviced land, and the underlying financing options available or\nthat can be made available. Considerations for the most appropriate interventions, subsidy and financing\nrequirements, target beneficiaries, type of housing stock, location, and tenure type must also be carefully weighed\nfor appropriateness to the local context and the specific challenges new financing tools are aiming to address. The\ndesign and delivery of new finance mechanisms will be contingent upon sufficient assessment of the many interlaced\n\n43\nfactors that need consideration, such as, capacity, goals, impact, time and cost effectiveness, and resources (budget,\nrevenue streams and labour force) which will all be carefully weighed when determining which financial models are\nbest to pursue. Considerations will be made as to how private sector finance can be better leveraged with limited\ngovernment resources while still offering attractive investment potential, and that also aligns with broader\naffordable housing goals. This output aims to convene housing finance experts to develop such new mechanisms\nand will deliver concrete financial scenarios for consideration by the GOI.\nUN-Habitat will contract with an international Housing Finance Expert to provide the necessary technical assistance\nin achieving this output. Output components will include:\n1. An assessment of Iraq’s current affordable housing finance models\n2. An international case study report. 3-4 case studies will be selected that are most applicable to Iraqi\nfinancial context.\n3. A technical report proposing new financial mechanisms- which includes 2-4 new financial models that could\nbe considered by the GOI and financial institutions to support the production and delivery of affordable\nhousing in Iraq.\nThis output will include these three technical reports which will be consolidated into one final submission.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 2.3.1: Assessment of government investment in all housing initiatives including sources and uses of funds,\nstatus and evaluation of program effectiveness and results, stakeholder involvement, capacity gaps etc.\nUN-Habitat’s project staff and International Housing Finance consultant, in close collaboration with the Ministry of\nConstruction and Housing (MoCH), and with support from government-sponsored financial institutions, including\nthe National Investment Commission, National Housing Fund, and Real Estate Bank, will undertake a comprehensive\nanalysis of the government's financial commitments to housing programs, focusing on various aspects including:\n- Government sponsored housing programmes: identification of housing initiatives supported by the GOI\nincluding responsible administrative entities.\n- Sources and uses of public funds: an examination of the sources and allocation of finances dedicated to\nhousing initiatives.\n- Target beneficiaries: identification of the intended beneficiaries various housing programs, paying\nparticular attention to low-income and vulnerable groups such as women, internally displaced persons\n(IDPs), and other vulnerable populations.\n- Program status and effectiveness: the current status and effectiveness of these housing programs, aiming\nto understand their impact and outcomes, and identifying areas in need of improvement.\n- Capacity gaps: identification of gaps in the capacity of institutions responsible for administering housing\nprograms.\n- Finance or completion gaps: identification of any barriers that may hinder the effective provision of\nfinancing or completion of housing projects in particular affordable housing.\n- Equity and Inclusion: evaluation of the extent to which Iraq’s housing programs promote equity and\ninclusion, particularly concerning women, IDPs, and other vulnerable populations.\nThe research will also incorporate the identification of legislative and regulatory barriers to affordable housing\nfinance, as outlined in Output 2.2. The findings will provide the foundation for the development of new financial\nmodels aimed at enhancing affordable and equitable housing solutions in Iraq.\n\n44\nActivity 2.3.2: Consultations with key financial stakeholders to determine both bottlenecks and opportunities for\naffordable housing investment.\nUN-Habitat, in coordination with MOCH, will engage in consultations with a range of housing finance experts.\nConsultation will encompass domestic developers, investors, government and private financial institutions,\ncontractors, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), investment commissions, as well as relevant Ministries and local\nauthorities. The overarching goal of these consultations is to discern and delineate both impediments and\nopportunities for investment in affordable housing, and to support the development of new finance mechanisms.\nWhere appropriate, UN-Habitat will coordinate these consultations with the International Trade Centre (ITC) and\nthe International Labour Organization (ILO).\nTo further facilitate the development of innovative financial models applicable within the Iraqi context, a dedicated\ntechnical working group will also be convened. Comprising both national and international experts in housing\nfinance, this group will convene as needed, with a minimum of three meetings during the output process. The\npurpose of the working group is to collaboratively avail new financial models feasible in the Iraqi context and validate\nthe recommendations. In situations where international engagement through a technical working group format\nfaces logistical challenges such as varying time zones and schedules, alternative means will be explored. These may\ninclude bilateral discussions or other formats designed to solicit expert input. The participation of 3 to 5 international\nexperts is envisioned.\nActivity 2.3.3: Develop housing finance international best practice case studies.\nUN-Habitat’s international Housing Finance Expert consultant with support from UN-Habitat project and HQ staff\nwill devise 3-4 international best practice case studies on innovative housing finance in countries similar to the Iraqi\ncontext. The selected case studies will provide a thorough analysis of successful housing finance models developed\nthrough Government initiatives in countries most relevant to the Iraqi context. The case studies will include the\ndetails on the financial model (sources, uses, etc.), details on the housing types, tenure, populations the affordable\nhousing supports, examples of successful housing developments, the preconditions for success, and lessons learned.\nCriteria for case study selection will be detailed and devised in coordination with the MoCH. Selection criteria will\ninclude factors such as replicability, suitability, scalability, similarities in investment climates, maturity in banking\nsectors, affordable housing deficit, and more. Case study findings will be presented to the technical working group\nand other stakeholder groups as a basis for discussion, reflection, and weighing the suitability of potential new\nmodels for Iraq.\nActivity 2.3.4: Development of new affordable housing financing mechanisms applicable to the Iraqi context.\nUN-Habitat’s Housing Finance Expert consultant with support from project staff and HQ housing experts and in\ncoordination with MOCH, will compile a technical report detailing 3-4 new financial models that the GOI could\nconsider pursuing that would support scaling the production and delivery of affordable housing. These newly\ndeveloped housing finance models will aim to maximize limited government resources while maximizing societal\nimpact which can take various forms and employ a variety of policy strategies (supply vs. demand, renovation vs.\nnew build, owner vs renter, single-family vs. multi-family, etc.). The aim of the new finance models will be to increase\naccess to adequate and affordable housing for low-income and other vulnerable population in Iraq. The proposed\nfinancing mechanisms will be peer reviewed and validated through MOCH, the technical working group and other\nkey stakeholders. The technical report will also provide additional details and supplemental information on key\nconsiderations for building a successful affordable housing program in Iraq. This can be supported by UN-Habitat\nresearch on affordable housing conducted in 2023 (not published) for the European Union.\nUN-Habitat in coordination with MOCH will present the newly developed finance mechanisms from the findings of\nthe study to pertinent stakeholder groups – particularly those that can support in seeing the tools come to fruition\nincluding potential investors and housing developers.\nActivity 2.3.5: Provide technical support and recommendations to GOI in developing and deploying feasible\naffordable housing finance models (utilizing both private and public finance including direct and indirect finance).\n\n45\nThe UN-Habitat Housing Finance expert and project staff will then provide technical assistance to MOCH and other\napplicable ministries to build out the finance tools and specifications of their choosing to further pursue and to\nengage with financial institutions and investors to discuss next steps. This activity will be pursued assuming MOCH’s\nwillingness and commitment to invest in new affordable housing programmes. In this case, UN-Habitat will support\nin building the programmatic and technical aspects of the newly designed housing program, including further\nsupport with refinement of the finance aspects.\nOutput 2.4: Expanded local planning capacity in coordination with local government and key local representatives\nin two neighbourhoods selected for pilot project.\nOutput 2.4 will involve supporting building housing planning capacity at the local government level through the\ndevelopment of participatory neighbourhood plans in the two communities as a precursor to the housing\nconstruction (Output 2.5). The technical support will provide hands-on learning opportunities from UN-Habitat\nexperts to guide government counterparts through sustainable development planning processes. The planning\nprocess will cover multiple aspects of housing planning that together, will produce one comprehensive\nneighbourhood plan for each housing pilot project location.\nThe neighbourhood planning processes involve creating profiles to comprehensively understand the physical and\nsocial dynamics of the areas where the new housing will be constructed. They will provide a contextual snapshot of\nthe area utilizing both visual tools as well as available data. Neighbourhood profiles can facilitate decision making\nthrough providing the evidence-base. For example, neighbourhood profiles will provide geographical context as to\nwhere assets and services such as where employment centres, healthcare facilities, schools, and public space are\nlocated within the vicinity. During this phase, local housing staff will be supported by UN-Habitat planning experts\nto articulate the profile through narratives and visuals such as GIS maps and Sketchup renderings.\nThe plan processes will also involve engaging in a participatory planning process to produce a neighbourhood plan\nthat reflects the vision of the community. Through workshops and active dialogue, neighbourhood representatives\nwill provide the guidance for developing the plan’s vision and articulation of the community’s priorities. The plan\nwill entail a holistic approach to future development that integrates the community’s vision and cultural context\nwith internationally recognized sustainability planning principles such as: compact development principles, public\nspace standards, street and sidewalk guidelines, environmental sustainability principles. During this phase,\ngovernment housing staff will be supported by UN-Habitats urban planners and designers to develop renderings and\ngraphics that reflect the community’s vision for the future, as well as the specific site plans for the planned\ndevelopment. UN-Habitat will contract an urban planning and design consultancy and national GIS and information\nconsultant to support UN-Habitat project staff with neighbourhood planning activities. It is the intent of this output\nto build the planning capacity of local urban planning and housing staff through hands-on technical support and\nknowledge exchange from UN-Habitat. Local staff involved in the planning efforts will be selected through MOCH\nand the Housing Directorates in coordination with UN-Habitat. Through technical assistance from UN-Habitat, these\nlocal staff members will learn the steps involved in creating sustainable and liveable communities and the\nfundamentals of urban planning international best practice. To the extent possible, UN-Habitat staff will workwith\nlocal planning staff in the two pilot locations to support hands-on training and learning.\nThe different elements of area-based planning that local government staff will gain exposure to and receive technical\nassistance, include:\n1. Developing neighbourhood profiles: detailed profiles that cover both physical and social aspects of the\nsurrounding neighbourhood in which the pilot housing units are to be developed.\n2. Designing participatory planning processes: this activity is focused on building and equitable and inclusive\napproach to planning efforts by actively engaging with community members and various stakeholder\ngroups. It aims to ensure that the voices and perspectives of those impacted the housing development\nconsidered and incorporated into the decision-making process\n\n46\n3. Developing site plans/designs- the site plans will include the technical lay-out of the future housing\ndevelopments. It will include architectural and urban design elements such as: housing density and layout,\nopen space, sidewalk and street networks, landscaping , etc.\nThese activities will be compiled into two comprehensive neighbourhood plans (one for each pilot location). The\nplans will help to guide the future housing developments, both in terms of design as well as in shaping program\nobjectives and guidelines.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 2.4.1: In collaboration with appropriate local authorities and other relevant counterparts identify site\nlocations in each of the two governorates for the pilot housing projects.\nUN-Habitat project staff will coordinate with the appropriate Ministries, local authorities and other relevant\ncounterparts to identify a list of potential site locations in each of the two governorates for the pilot housing projects.\nCriteria for weighing potential sites will be established and assessed on factors such as: environmental impact,\nclimate risk, topography conditions, proximity to transportation and amenities, surrounding future planned\ndevelopment, costs and processes for acquisition, plot size, etc. Site visits with government counterparts will be\nconducted on the short-listed list of plots. Once sites have been selected – UN-Habitat will proceed with working\nwith appropriate departments to secure the proper permissions, approvals and permits for housing development. It\nis anticipated that there will be no land acquisition cost and that the government will retain land ownership but\ngrant development rights. This is activity is a necessary and often time consuming, precursor to neighbourhood\nplanning efforts.\nActivity 2.4.2: Conduct consultations with key local stakeholders including local officials, businesses, CSOs, NGOs,\ncommunity members, etc.\nOnce the development sites are selected, UN-Habitat and government counterparts will proceed with outreach\nactivities to inform local stakeholders of the upcoming activities, gauge potential partnerships, and collect initial\ninput and local insight. Community outreach activities will be instrumental to neighbourhood planning and housing\ndevelopment activities. UN-Habitat is fully committed to gaining community acceptance and utilizing local insight to\nenvision new neighbourhoods and housing developments that are liveable and sustainable - and directly reflect the\nneeds and desires of the community - which is at the core of this output.\nActivity 2.4.3: In collaboration with appropriate local authorities, devise neighbourhood profiles for each pilot\narea.\nIn collaboration with local authorities, UN-Habitat’s urban planning consultants will create neighbourhood profiles\nfor each pilot area. UN-Habitat staff will coordinate with local officials to identify local staff that will be responsible\nfor creating neighbourhood plans with technical support and hands-on training from UN-Habitat planning staff.\nWorking with local staff, UN-Habitat will support in building the framework and processes involved devising\nneighbourhood plans. This will entail series of steps, such as:\n1. Data collection from government agencies, local authorities, and other sources.\n2. Interviews and questionnaires may be utilized to gain further insight from residents, community leaders,\nlocal business or CSOs to determined community needs, concerns and aspirations.\n3. Creating Visual and graphic elements including photos, maps, GIS, or renderings may be added to the\ncommunity profile to better visualize the spatial element and context of the neighbourhood concept.\n4. A physical environmental assessment which entails an exercise mapping the neighbourhoods infrastructure\nand assets including- road networks, local businesses, schools, transportation, public spaces, and other\namenities.\n\n47\n5. A culture assessment involves creating an understanding the social fabric which might include locations of\nNGOs, charities, cultural groups, social services as well as understanding the general cultural diversity of\nthe neighbourhood.\nOnce the appropriate elements of the neighbourhood profile are determined, a roadmap for completion will be\ndevised with local staff. It is expected that the assigned local staff will take the initiative to complete all activities\nunder this output, through guidance and support provided by UN-Habitat.\nActivity 2.4.4: Engage community members in a participatory planning process in two pilot locations.\nParticipatory planning processes for affordable housing development involve actively engaging community members\nand stakeholders in decision-making, ensuring that their input and needs are considered throughout the planning\nand development phases. UN-Habitat will support local government planning staff in learning the steps and methods\ninvolved in developing an effective participatory planning approach. Each pilot project location will host a minimum\nof two community meetings where participatory approaches will be applied. During the conceptualization of the\nhousing program, guiding principles will be devised and applied through the stakeholder engagement process which\nprovides the normative context for establishing the housing program. The guiding principles will establish the belief\nand values that will be applied when executing the program. The participatory planning effort will also establish a\ncommunity vision and will help to inform the development of neighbourhood plans that reflects accurate cultural\nand social dimensions and desires of local residents.\nActivity 2.4.5: Develop site plans reflecting participatory planning input and neighbourhood profiles.\nUN-Habitat's team of Urban Planning consultants, in collaboration with input from Architecture and Engineering\nconsultants, the Lead Engineer, Construction and Quality Control Supervisors, and project staff, will offer technical\nsupport to local personnel in the development of site plans that align with international sustainability standards. Site\ndesigns are foundational to the development of new housing projects, serving as the blueprint that dictates land\nutilization, organization, and development.\nThe initial phase of the site design process involves the creation of conceptual designs, which strategically allocate\nspaces for buildings, commercial zones, public amenities, and green areas. These site plans will comprehensively\nincorporate environmental design considerations, encompassing factors such as building orientation, population\ndensity, green spaces, and various climate mitigation measures, as well as initiatives for environmental protection\nand conservation.\nTo enhance visualization and understanding, these conceptual designs will be transformed into visual\nrepresentations of the sites. This will be achieved using visualization software, such as SketchUp, AutoCAD, and GIS,\nenabling the creation of renderings and maps that illustrate the site's layout and features.\nAdaptations in the level of technical assistance provided will be contingent upon the skill levels of the local\ngovernment housing staff. In some instances, UN-Habitat may take the lead in generating the visual components of\nthe site plan, all the while ensuring that local staff are exposed to these tools and provided with hands-on learning\nopportunities. This approach aims to create site plans that reflect international sustainable development principles\nwhile simultaneously bolstering the capacity-building of public sector housing professionals.\nActivity 2.4.6: Compile and disseminate comprehensive neighbourhood plans in two pilot locations.\nIn partnership with MOCH and local authorities, UN-Habitat staff and Urban Planning consultant, will compile the\nplan components into consolidated neighbourhood plans for each pilot location. These plans will encompass various\ncomponents of the aforementioned activities conducted in collaboration with local planning staff, which includes\nthe neighbourhood profiles, the site plans for the new pilot neighbourhoods and the community vision which reflects\nthe inputs from community members and other stakeholders engaged in the participatory planning processes. The\nplans will be openly shared and promoted with community members and stakeholder groups via print copies and\nsocial media channels. Ultimately the plans will serve as the guiding framework for the design and realization of the\nfuture housing developments. The plans will also serve as a model for future sustainable neighbourhood planning\nactivities throughout Iraq.\n\n48\nActivity 2.4.7: Determine and finalize policy aims and programmatic guidelines for housing pilot projects based on\nneighbourhood plan(s) findings and recommendations.\nDuring this phase, UN-Habitat in consultation with MOCH, Housing Directorates, and local authorities will develop\nthe precise program details for the two upcoming housing developments. This entails adopting an area-based\napproach to discern the most suitable interventions, which encompasses subsidy and financing requirements, target\nbeneficiary identification, rent setting mechanisms, and tenure types. These considerations will be evaluated for\ntheir appropriateness within the local context and with regard to the specific challenges the program aims to\naddress.\nFurthermore, the program's design and implementation will encompass a comprehensive assessment of numerous\ninterconnected factors. These factors include capacity assessment, strategic goals, anticipated impacts, time and\ncost-effectiveness, as well as resource allocation considerations such as budgetary constraints, revenue streams,\nand available labor force. All of these elements will be carefully weighed when formulating the program's objectives\nand establishing the guidelines for the pilot housing units.\nOutput 2.5: Increased availability of multi-story green affordable housing units including basic infrastructure\n(roads, water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and electricity) for communities in two Iraqi governorates.\nIn output 2.5, UN-Habitat in partnership with the GOI will deliver a proof of concept that green social housing in Iraq\nis a viable means to address the housing deficit for low-income and vulnerable populations. The activities will entail\na partnership approach with all levels of government, to pilot a total of 200 social housing units in two governorates\n(100 each). The pilot project will demonstrate sustainable development principles in Iraq through the construction\nof compact (2-3 stories) development which utilizes land more efficiently and is less taxing on infrastructure. In\npartnership with ILO and ITC these activities will integrate PEIP job creation in the housing and infrastructure\nconstruction activities and support in building SMEs green and affordable housing competency. This output will\nentail all pre-development, development and offtake activities including processes such as determining the financing\nmechanism (and risk sharing), rent setting, beneficiary selection, resident participation plans, and ongoing\noperations and maintenance.\nHousing designs will consider the local climate context and will utilize sustainable building materials, to the extent\npossible. With support from ITC, this output will entail extensive research on available sustainable building materials\nand cost-effective energy efficient and renewable measure that will be incorporated in the housing units that\nultimately results in quantifiable greenhouse gas reductions. The project will prepare a comparative assessment on\nthe various possible approaches to maximize building performance, including factors such as the overall value\nproposition, lifecycle assessments, the availability of materials, transportation costs, and availability of skilled\nworkers, while carefully weighing the assumptions and potential risks involved with each measure. Working with\nsustainable design experts, the housing will incorporate all feasible green measures including design, materials and\nappliances.\nThis output intends to serve as a test bed for new and innovative approaches to green housing in Iraq and to serve\nas a centrepiece for building environmental awareness at the community level. Throughout the activities detailed\nbelow, UN-Habitat will collaborate closely with local government staff who are involved in housing planning, to build\nlocal capacity in activities related to undergoing housing construction projects.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 2.5.1: Conduct detailed site surveys on the pre-identified pilot housing site locations.\nUN-Habitat’s Lead Engineer in coordination with construction & QC supervisors and other project staff to conduct\ndetailed site surveys on the pre-identified pilot housing site locations to understand the topography, soil conditions,\nenvironmental factors and any hazards or limitations. The findings from the site surveys will inform the final site\nlayout, determining building orientation, and influencing the architectural design of the housing units. The site\nassessment will also inform the requisite site preparation activities and foundation design.\n\n49\nTo ensure all parties involved in the project are well-informed about the site’s particulars, the site assessments will\nbe done in coordination with local authorities. The collaborative approach will ensure a shared understanding of the\nsite's characteristics and ensure effective project planning and execution. If required, an environmental impact\nassessment will also be conducted.\nActivity 2.5.2: Partner with engineers and architects to develop building designs and models most suitable in each\nclimatic context aimed at improving climate resilience, adaptation and mitigation standards for each of the three\nregions including selected building materials, building orientation, vernacular architectural elements etc.\nContract with engineers and architects to develop building designs and models most tailored to the climatic\nconditions of each region. The primary objective is to ensure that these designs aling with climate resilience,\nadaptation, and mitigation objectives. This entails factors such as the selection of appropriate building materials,\nstrategic building orientation, and incorporation of vernacular architectural elements. The tendering of contractor\nservices with input from ITC will be integral to achieving desired results and in achieving project integration.\nThis activity will also include conducting extensive research on the availability of energy-savings measures that are\navailable (or can become available) in the Iraqi marketplace. The research will include an assessment of the expected\nenvironmental benefits such as ghg reductions. The research approach will employ life cycle assessments to evaluate\nreturns on investment and the potential for utility cost savings. A comparative analysis will be devised to identify\nthe most suitable and cost-effective \"green\" measures for each project location, prioritizing the best value\nproposition.\nThis activity will also incorporate a gender analysis gender analysis of risk, need, demand, barriers, and supply on\nproposed adaptation and mitigation strategies (GAP III). The selection of building materials and energy measures\nwill be done with input with ITC.\nThe selection of building materials and energy-saving measures will be conducted in consultation with ITC, tapping\ninto their expertise and ensuring an integrated approach to project decision-making.\nActivity 2.5.3: Undertake pre-construction activities for the construction of social housing units.\nUN-Habitat’s Lead Engineers and Construction and Quality Control Supervisors and project staff will be responsible\nfor pre-construction activities in close coordination with MOCH and local authorities. Installation of infrastructure\nand basic services will be contracted out through a competitive bid process. A number discreet steps are included in\nthe preconstruction phase of housing development which include:\no Permits and Approvals: in coordination with local authorities, obtain all necessary permits and approvals\nfor each of the (2) targeted governorates ensuring compliance with local building codes, zoning and other\nregulations.\no Site plans: Finalize detailed site plans and multi-story (2-3) building designs\no Finance: Develop pro-forma – determine sources and uses of funds for housing developments (including\ninvestments and subsidies) and secure financing. Develop a comprehensive budget including construction\ncosts, materials and labour expenses, and contingencies. Secure additional project financing (if applicable)\nand establish financial arrangements – contracts and agreements.\no BOQ: Develop a Bill of Quantities (BoQ) for construction of affordable housing units and construction of\nbasic infrastructure are developed. A detailed project schedule will also be devised for all construction\nactivities.\no Contractor Tendering: Tender applicable construction and/or engineering services through a competitive\nbid process and select qualified contractors. Contractors will be selected with input from ITC and ILO to\nensure project integration.\n\n50\no Site preparation: in coordination with local authorities clearance of construction site and installation of\ninfrastructure and basic services including roads, water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and electricity and\npublic facilities on each site location.\nActivity 2.5.4: Construct 200 multi-story affordable green social housing units in compact neighbourhoods (100\nper pilot location).\nUN-Habitat’s Lead Engineers and Construction & QC Supervisors will be responsible for oversite of all construction\nactivities conducted by housing construction contractors who will be contracted through a competitive bid process.\nThroughout the construction activities, UN-Habitat staff will effectively collaborate with contractors, subcontractors,\nand skilled laborers to ensure that the housing development is constructed efficiently, safely, and in accordance with\nthe design and quality standards. Effective project management and communication are essential to the successful\ncompletion of the housing development. This activity will entail constructing 100 multi-story (2-3 story) green social\nhousing units on each of the two sites. Discreet steps under construction activities include:\no Foundation construction: construct foundations based on architectural and engineering plans\no Framing of building (2-3) story – framing includes erection of walls, floors, and roof structures. Framing\nmaterials will be selected in close consideration of availability of local building materials, durability of\nmaterials, and environmental considerations\no Utility installation: Plumbing, electrical, HVAC, energy savings appliances (renewables and efficiency). This\nstep includes pipework, wiring, and ductwork.\no Exterior: roofing, siding, insulation, and windows\no Interior work: walls are framed and insulation is installed. Drywall or other finished are applied and windows\nand doors are installed\no Quality Control, Safety and Inspections: Regular inspections are conducted to ensure that construction\nmeets safety and quality standards. Safety precautions, including barricades, signage, and protective gear,\nare in place to protect workers and site visitors. Compliance with occupational safety regulations is critical.\nFinal inspections by local building authorities are carried out to verify compliance with all relevant codes\nand regulations. Permits are issued for occupancy once the project passes inspection.\no Unit off-take according to pre-defined tenure type, beneficiary selection process and beneficiary placement\nsupport\no Ongoing maintenance and operation plan: Determine ongoing maintenance needs and commensurate\nfunding streams (tender property mgmt., if applicable).\nActivity 2.5.5: Develop ongoing beneficiary participation and resident services plan.\nThis activity entails the development of a comprehensive Housing Beneficiary Participation and Engagement Plan.\nThis structured process is designed to guarantee the inclusion of the voices, needs, and concerns of the housing\nbeneficiaries within the framework of the housing project(s). The overarching goal of the engagement plan is to\nensure that the perspectives of those poised to benefit from the housing units are not only acknowledged but\nactively incorporated into the project's ongoing operations and activities.\nUN-Habitat project staff in coordination with local government housing staff will undertake the task of formulating\nbeneficiary engagement plan, ultimately fostering housing projects that are community-driven and responsive to\nlocal needs. The plan will be developed with resident input and engagement through interactive dialogue such as\nworkshops, interviews, and/ or focus groups. The plan will serve as the foundational structure for sustaining resident\nparticipation in decision-making processes over time.\nThe plan will delineate the mechanisms through which direct beneficiaries of the housing units can continue to\nactively participate in decision-making processes. This may encompass the establishment of tenant councils,\n\n51\nfacilitating resident to identify additional supportive services they require, or involving them in the programming of\ncommunity events and dialogues. The plan will aim to building inclusive and people-centered communities, ensuring\nthat the diverse voices within the community are not only heard but valued in shaping the trajectory of the housing\nprojects.\nActivity 2.5.6: Unit off-take according to pre-defined programme guidelines\nAfter the construction of the housing units, a structured process for allocating these units to housing beneficiaries\nwill be put into action. This responsibility falls under the purview of UN-Habitat in collaboration with the Ministry of\nConstruction and Housing (MOCH), which will be tasked with creating all the necessary procedural documents.\nThe offtake procedure encompasses several key elements, beginning with the determination of beneficiary eligibility\nthrough the formulation of a comprehensive beneficiary selection criteria. This criterion will encompass evaluating\nincome requirements and establishing a system for prioritizing specific target populations.\nProspective applicants will be required to navigate an application process, including income verification, as well as\nan interview and screening phase. The notification of housing availability and the call for applicants will receive\nsupport from local NGOs, MOCH, Housing Directorates, and local officials.\nFurthermore, the beneficiary selection process will entail the development of waitlist policies and procedures. Once\nbeneficiaries are selected, they will proceed to sign a lease agreement, and they will be expected to adhere to\nresidency and compliance rules and regulations. Throughout the entire process, UN-Habitat will be responsible for\nthe selection and placement of beneficiaries, working within the established mechanisms to ensure a fair and\ntransparent allocation of the housing units.\nOutput 2.6: Increased awareness of housing environmental footprint and urban policies\nIn this output UN-Habitat intends to utilize one model unit in each of the pilot areas to serve as “Centres for Green\nTechnology”. The facilities will be established to serve as community environmental resource facilities and as\nregional training hubs for ongoing environmental awareness activities including demonstrating the green\ntechnologies incorporated into the housing units, training programs for a variety of stakeholder groups, and ongoing\nawareness raising activities among the communities. These activities will be developed in coordination with ILO and\nITC so that the facilities can host a variety of green related trainings, workshops and seminars related to the joint\naspirations of the project. Indicative activities include:\no Public awareness campaigns, trainings, and exhibitions for community members on topics such as: disaster\nrisk reduction, environmental conservation and energy reduction measures that can be realized at the\nhousehold and community level, water conservation and recycling.\no Exhibitions for professionals and community members that showcase sustainable building materials, energy\nefficient and renewable technologies, in particular, technologies are utilized in pilot homes.\no Environmental awareness workshops to CSO’s, trade organizations and other key stakeholder groups.\no Technical green building and sustainable housing development trainings (code enforcement, procurement,\nenergy standards and certifications, etc.) for government staff, SMES’s, architects, engineers, etc.\no Green jobs and skills trainings with a particular focus on developing knowledge and skills for unemployed\nwomen, youth, and IDPs\nA sustainability plan will be devised to ensure continuance of activities beyond the project duration.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 2.6.1: Construct one model unit on each project site, designed to serve a dual function as both an open\ncommunity center and a \"Center for Green Technology.\" These units are intended to demonstrate the green\ntechnologies employed in the housing projects and raise awareness about environmentally sustainable practices,\nwhile also functioning as regional hubs for green training.\n\n52\nEach project site will feature a model housing unit designed to fulfill a dual role as a community center and a \"Center\nfor Green Technology.\" These model units will serve as \"regional green training centers\" and will be strategically\npositioned to showcase the sustainable technologies integrated into the housing projects, fostering green\nawareness. Further the Green Centres will promote environmental awareness through hosting events, workshops,\nand various activities dedicated to sustainability and green housing.\nActivity 2.6.2: Activate and utilize the 'Regional Centers for Green Technology' spaces by organizing monthly\nexhibitions, lectures, demonstrations, events, and training sessions. These activities are designed to foster\nenvironmental awareness across the private, non-profit, and public sectors, as well as at the household and\ncommunity levels.\nUN-Habitat staff with local officials will take the lead in organizing environmental awareness initiatives, working in\ncollaboration with ILO and ITC to ensure a coordinated approach towards promoting sustainability and green\npractices within the community. The green centres will host periodic exhibitions, lectures, demonstrations, events,\nand trainings aimed at building environmental awareness. Activities may also be geared to hosting topic-specific\ntrainings aimed at professionals, businesses, non-profits, and government representatives. Importantly this space\nwill serve a resource centre for beneficiaries of the housing units on how to maintain, operate and maximize energy\nefficient installations utilized within the housing units. and at the household and community level.\nTo support their functions, the centers will be staffed by community volunteers who will receive training from UN-\nHabitat personnel, providing valuable job skills and capacity-building opportunities, particularly for housing\nbeneficiaries. Additional partners will be identified and pursued to support in providing activities, funding, and\nprogramming.\nActivity 2.6.3: Devise a sustainability plan for the \"Centers for Green Technology\" to ensure their continuity\nbeyond the project's duration.\nTo ensure continued operation of the Centres for Green technology beyond the project’s duration, a sustainability\nplan will be developed in coordination with MoCH, other applicable Ministries, and local officials. The sustainability\nplan will serve to identify new funding streams, project sponsors, and ongoing building operations and management,\nincluding programmatic activities.\nThe development of the sustainability plan will be a collaborative effort, guided by UN-Habitat project staff, with\ninput from the donor, government counterparts, and project partners ILO and ITC. The primary aim of the plan is to\nensure appropriate levels of funding can be secured to keep the centres operational well into the future. This\napproach seeks to ensure the long-term viability of the centers and their positive impact on the community.\nFundraising plans and activities will begin prior to inauguration of the green centres to ensure solvency and to\nmaximize additional potential resources to support activities.\nIf securing long-term funding is not possible, contingency plans will be explored, which may involve transitioning the\nunits into social housing units to ensure their continued use and benefit to the community.\n4.5 RESULTS CHAIN OUTCOME THREE\n4.5.1 OUTCOME THREE: INTERVENTION LOGIC\nIf the partnership between Iraqi public and private stakeholders to designing and implementing a green sustainable\nconstruction sector development strategy will is strengthened (Op. 3.1); if opportunities and capacities of value\nchain actors for private sector-led affordable, quality construction and climate-adaptive buildings retrofit are\nimproved (Op. 3.2); if the capacities of local businesses, particularly young entrepreneurs, for the integration of\ngreen and innovative practices in their operation are enhanced (Op. 3.3); if the regulatory and legal framework for\naccess to and provision of construction and housing services in Iraq is improved and the related potential for reform\nis in line with the broader trade policy reform led by the GoI (Op. 3.4); and, if the awareness and capacities of public\nand private stakeholders of the regulatory and procedural framework for investing in the housing and construction\nsectors and potential for reform are also enhanced (Op. 3.5), then the business environment and participation of\n\n53\nlocal MSMEs and investors in the construction sector will be improved (Oc. 3), as long as access to primary and/or\nsecondary data is sufficient; an adequate level of transparency exists in the supply chain; the collaboration and\ncoordination among policy makers is sufficient and so is the absorption capacity of beneficiaries, ministries and\nagencies; sector stakeholders have the necessary maturity level and political support for developing and\nimplementing needed sector strategies and policies; the commitment towards the reform process from the\nGovernment continues to hold; there is an adequate buy-in and commitment from public-private sector\nstakeholders towards strategy implementation; employers are involved in the content development for the National\nQuality Framework in order for it to be aligned with their needs; basic necessary skills are available to SME\nowners/managers in order to be more competitive in value chains; absorption capacities of the Ministries and\nagencies are sufficient.\n4.5.2 OUTCOME THREE: DESCRIPTION\nImproved business environment and participation of local MSMEs and investors in the construction sector.\nActivities under Outcome 3 aim to address challenges in the construction sector that limit the potential contributions\nof small businesses to employment generation, the creation of affordable and sustainable housing, and economic\ngrowth and diversification. These include support for the improvement of capacities of firms, the efficiency of value\nchains, and environment to access and operate in the construction and housing sectors in Iraq. Due to their\ndynamism, MSMEs in particular stand to make a major contribution to the improvement of the housing sector and\nwill be assisted in this through project’s activities on strategy design and implementation, local organisation, and\ntraining and capacity building. ITC’s experience in working with the private sector and other stakeholders, and\nfacilitating public-private collaboration on strategy design and implementation, firm-level capacity building, value\nchain coordination, and trade and investment policy and regulatory reform, and trade and investment to drive\nsustainable and inclusive growth will be leveraged in implementing these elements of the project. Specific attention\nwill be given to ensuring that safety standards and disaster resilience are promoted.\n4.5.3 OUTCOME THREE: OUTPUTS AND ACTIVITIES\nOutput 3.1: Strengthened partnership between Iraqi public and private stakeholders to design and implement a\ngreen sustainable construction sector development strategy.\nA sustainable sector development strategy is needed to provide a solid basis for a strengthened construction sector\nby setting common policy priorities and coordinating key actors. In order to maximise the impact of the strategy, the\nproject includes activities under Output 3.1 on value chain analysis, participatory strategy design, the establishment\nor strengthening of an effective public-private sector coordination structure responsible for implementation,\ntechnical and advisory on implementation management including monitoring and resource mobilization.\nThe strategy will be comprehensive in scope, addressing the development of products and services directed at\nincreasing productivity, promoting investment, nurturing innovation, enhancing value addition, and improving the\ninstitutional and regulatory environment.\nThe strategy will address issues that constrain competitiveness and private sector development, while ensures that\ndevelopmental objectives are targeted. To this end, the strategy design process will follow an inclusive and\nparticipative approach to ensure that all stakeholders are consulted and have ownership over the resulting strategy\nand implementation plan. Women empowerment considerations will be incorporated into the analysis of challenges\nand opportunities throughout the sector development strategy, highlighting the needs and priorities of women-led\nMSMEs and key recommendations. To this end, women-led MSMEs and relevant public and private sector\norganisations representing women in the private sector will be consulted and interviewed during the strategy design\nprocess. Through this approach, the strategy will reflect their needs and priorities by elaborating specific and tailored\nrecommendations in the action plan.\nFindings and recommendations from other existing endorsed plans will be integrated and further developed. A\ncapacity-building approach will be adopted along the process, with the aim of strengthening the capacity of national\npartners to formulate, manage and implement their own strategy.\n\n54\nThe project will work with stakeholders to design the detailed strategy, including a five-year plan of action, that\nallocates responsibilities, and specifies timelines and targets. As a result, the Government of Iraq will own a strategy\nfor the construction sector that is specific and measurable to ensure well-managed implementation, accountability,\nand that the desired results are achieved. These activities will be delivered directly through the project, with the\npotential involvement of external experts in an advisory capacity.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 3.1.1: Define strategy design process, roles, including the focal point organization and person, and work\nplan.\nDefine strategy design process, roles, including the focal point organization and persons, and develop a work plan.\nThis includes the identification and appointment of a Navigator to champion the design and delivery of the strategy\nfor the construction sector. The Navigator is usually respected individual, likely a senior official from the public sector\nfrom the relevant Ministry or from the Prime Minister’s office, who is appointed to the management of the strategy\nfor the duration of the design process.\nIn collaboration with project partners, this activity would entail as well the identification (or formation) of a sector-\nlevel coordination platform to guide the strategy design process and subsequent implementation. This coordination\nmechanism will guide the process of strategy design and ultimately take responsibility for guiding its\nimplementation. This continuity encourages the development of realistic and useful planning for the sector’s future.\nWhere possible, synergies will be sought with other areas of project governance in the establishment of this\nmechanism.\nActivity 3.1.2: Conduct comprehensive background research on the structure and functioning of the value chain,\nincluding in-depth quantitative and quality analysis of MSMEs’ participation in the sector, and of market access\nand trends for the sector.\nConduct comprehensive background research on the structure and functioning of the construction value chain,\nincluding an in-depth quantitative and quality analysis of MSMEs’ participation in the sector, and of market access\nand trends for the sector.\nThis activity will build on the analysis conducted for the project development, as well as relevant assessments to be\ncarried out during the inception phase by all partners. This includes a comprehensive analysis of the policy\nframework, to ensure alignment with the strategy and avoid potential duplications. A further identification will be\ncarried out of public sector, private sector, and other actors, including development partners that are directly\nengaged in the housing and construction value chain and in establishing the environment in which these actors\noperate.\nFurther assessments will include analysis of production, processing and market related data for the sector, as well\nas its impact on socio-economic development. An in-depth analysis of MSME’s participation of the sector may\ninclude a survey of firms to understand their key characteristics, challenges to compete, connect among each other\nand with supporting institutions and to upgrade their practices.\nA first value chain map and initial analysis that identifies major constraints and highlights the most promising\nopportunities, particularly to increase MSME participation and entry points for youth participation, innovation and\nsustainability of the sector will be produced. The project’s cross-cutting themes related to inclusive and sustainable\ngrowth will be central to this research.\nExpert advice may be sought here and at later stages in the strategy design process on sector research and the\ndevelopment of specific activities and targets for the strategy’s plan of action.\nThe output will be a preliminary sector diagnostic which will be presented, discussed and refined during the first\nconsultation with stakeholders.\nActivity 3.1.3: Consultation with sector stakeholders (public and private sector) to present, refine and validate the\nsector diagnostics and propose initial solutions.\n\n55\nStakeholders representing various aspects of the construction value chain will meet to discuss and agree on a\ncommon vision and way forward for strengthening economic opportunities, sustainability, and housing affordability.\nIf possible, this will be done through a single discussion in order to foster consensus-building, though smaller group\ndiscussions may be used with ongoing communication with participants to validate evolving conclusions. The\nbackground research on value chain structure, challenges, and opportunities will be used to structure the\ndiscussions, though participants will be invited to challenge these preliminary findings. The consultation aims to\nachieve broad-based agreement on the vision for the strategy and main areas of work to be encompassed.\nStakeholders will be actively involved throughout the consultations which are comprised of ITC-facilitated capacity-\nbuilding and decision-making sessions.\nThe consultation will be highly practical and results-oriented in nature. It is deliberately structured this way so that\nupon the conclusion of the consultations, material is produced that feeds directly into the Construction Strategy.\nOutputs of the first consultation are as follows:\n• Definition of the sector scope,\n• Refining and validating the sector value chain,\n• Identifying competitiveness constraints,\n• Identify and discuss potential solutions to key challenges.\nActivity 3.1.4: Development of a detailed plan of action for the strategy, including entry points for greater MSME\nparticipation, closing the skills gaps, developing business models and measures to foster the adoption of\nsustainable practices.\nThe background research and outcomes of the first stakeholder consultation will be consolidated and used in further\nelaborating the strategic orientations and specific recommendations that can contribute to enhance MSME\nparticipation and performance in the sector, as well as activities that address supply-side, business environment and\nmarket entry issues, as well as development side challenges. These actions will be explored as responses to particular\nchallenges identified by sector stakeholders. Recommendations would also include entry points for greater MSME\nparticipation, closing the skills gaps, developing business models and measures to foster the adoption of sustainable\npractices.\nActivity 3.1.5: Second consultation for the validation of the strategy to refine the strategic orientations and\nactivities of the plan of action, as well as to validate the coordination body to oversee and guide the\nimplementation.\nThe second consultation for the validation of the strategy to develop and further refine the strategic orientations\nand activities of the plan of action, as well as to validate the coordination body to oversee and guide implementation.\nBringing together again the stakeholders involved in the first consultation, the second consultation will focus on the\ndetails of the draft actions included, the inclusion of new actions, and the removal of unnecessary actions. The goal\nof the second consultation is therefore to reach broad-based agreement on the structure and content of the\nstrategy’s plan of action. This support improves the design and its relevance to the sector, in addition to beginning\nto build necessary momentum for its implementation.\nThe plan of action has a 5-year timeline. Since recommendations and strategic orientations are necessary but not\nsufficient, the plan of action systematically highlights next steps required to implement the strategy and outlines a\ntimeline for implementing those steps. In addition, the Plan of Action identifies organizations responsible for\nimplementing the highlighted actions. Project ideas derived from the action plan deliver key entry points for\ngovernment action, private sector support and development partners. To ensure successful implementation,\noutreach and donor mobilization are built into the design process.\nActivity 3.1.6: Presentation of the way forward to the sector-level coordination body for validation.\n\n56\nThe way forward will describe the core elements of the strategy at the level of the vision and strategic objectives,\nwith context on the challenges being addressed and concerns of contributing stakeholders. The validation of the way\nforward by the sector-level coordination platform, confirms the general scope and priorities of the strategy, as well\nas the support of the key stakeholders involved in the coordination body. This ensures that the vision is achievable\nand properly aligned with relevant development initiatives.\nActivity 3.1.7: Finalization and validation of Iraq’s construction sector strategy, followed by an official launch\nceremony.\nWhere needed, adjustments will be made to the strategy following the recommendations of the coordination body\nand other relevant stakeholders in order to enhance its relevance to sector goals and to best support the effective\nimplementation of the strategy. The strategy will be available in English and Arabic.\nTo ensure the strategy mobilizes national and international support required for its implementation, the lead\nministry, with ITC’s technical support, will seek high-level endorsement. In this manner, the Plan of Action will obtain\nthe commitment of the government to allocate the necessary resources and responsibilities for its implementation.\nThe endorsement of the strategy will be followed by an official launch ceremony to ensure visibility and gain\nmomentum towards implementation.\nActivity 3.1.8: Support to define and operationalize a public-private sector coordination structure to manage the\nimplementation of the strategy.\nA key success criterion for success of strategy will be the country’s ability to coordinate activities, monitor progress\nand mobilize resources for its implementation. To this end, the project’s support will contribute to defining and\noperationalizing an adequate governance structure, e.g. sector coordination committee, to build collaboration.\nIncluding the main organisations responsible for the plan’s actions, the sector strategy coordination body will be\nestablished as the body responsible for overseeing the implementation process. This will include coordinating\ninitiatives and may require their leadership in adapting the strategy as needed and in consultation with stakeholders.\nActivity 3.1.9: Capacity strengthening, including coaching to national sector coordination body and its Secretariat.\nSuccessful implementation management of a strategy ensures that all relevant institutions and partners are enabled\nto implement activities within a coherent framework. Accordingly, strategy implementation management support\nfocuses assisting such a framework and providing specialized tools and advice to ensure successful implementation\nand monitoring of activities outlined in the Plan of Action (PoA) of the Strategy. The project’s intervention will aim\nto capacitate the Secretariat of the established sector coordination structure, so as to guarantee that initiatives\nimplemented are aligned to the priorities of the stakeholders as defined in the strategy. Technical assistance and\ncapacity building will be provided as required. Tools and organisational best practices in achieving strategy\nimplementation will be shared with the coordination body to support tracking, resource mobilisation, sector\ncoordination, and management of responsibilities in the implementation process.\nOutput 3.2: Improved opportunities and capacities of supply chain actors for private sector-led affordable, quality\nconstruction and climate-adaptive buildings retrofit.\nBuilding on the findings of the strategy design process, Output 3.2 will support enhanced coordination among small\nbusinesses in the construction sector in order to enhance their performance. The organisation of value chain actors\nin MSME alliances in two governorates through the project will assist smaller firms in accessing new markets, reduce\ncosts and improve firm-level capacities through enhanced information sharing and economies of scale. This\ncooperation will provide a model demonstrating the means and benefits of organisation. Output 3.2 activities on\norganising local MSME alliances in high-potential areas, local-level planning, design and technical solutions in\nconstruction, and organisational capacity building will provide a basis for cooperation among firms. ITC has\nexperience on training MSMEs on resource efficiency and circular production resulting in reduction in GHG emissions\nover a multi-annual process, increased productivity, cost reduction and enhanced compliance with environmental\nstandards and regulations. Through the coaching programme on Resource Efficiency and Circular Production (RECP),\nITC will build the capacity of construction MSMEs to optimize the use and management of resources (water, energy,\nchemicals and waste) and identify solutions to make production processes greener. The ITC RECP coaching\n\n57\nprogramme has been implemented in over 15 countries and 10 value chains and can be adapted to serve any\nproductive sector. Active collaboration and dialogue between value chain actors – including international companies\nand local suppliers – is facilitated through this approach to ensure joint implementation of resource-efficient and\ncleaner production practices.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 3.2.1: Climate-Smart Housing Retrofit Consumer Research, Product-Market combination, and selection of\ntarget areas.\nBuilding on activities under output 3.1, ITC and partners plan to conduct market research on climate-smart housing\nretrofit solutions and affordable housing construction in Iraq, with a focus on energy efficiency and climate\nadaptation, particularly in high-temperature environments. The research will identify options for new retrofit\nproducts to be offered by MSMEs in the fields of energy-efficient appliances / air conditioning, water efficiency, heat\ninsulation, and renewable energy solutions within an affordable budget range (e.g. $5,000 - $10,000 package\nincluding installation cost). In the same time consumers assessment will identify the most relevant areas for project\nintervention while setting clear selection criteria balancing vulnerability and market requirements. Possible\npartnership to serve housing fund recipients will be also explored (e.g. housing fund beneficiaries). These insights\nwill inform subsequent activities under outputs 3.2 and 3.3, empowering local SMEs to offer tailored, cost-effective,\nand sustainable solutions to address climate challenges while fostering economic growth in the construction and\nenergy sectors.\nActivity 3.2.2: Organize market awareness events on innovative climate-smart services and establish MSME\nalliances to enhance collaboration, knowledge sharing, and collective bargaining power, strengthening the sector.\nThis multifaceted activity will create two local associations of construction MSMEs (“Alliances”) that will be both\nconnected with construction material / innovative climate-smart solution suppliers, relevant service providers (e.g\narchitectural design services, housing finance) and potential consumers. By creating these alliances, we aim to\nprovide smaller firms with a platform to collectively address challenges, share insights, and negotiate more\neffectively in areas such as procurement and market access. Under this activity, steps will also be taken to stimulate\nconsumer demand for innovative retrofit products, encourage local Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)\nin the construction sector to invest in this evolving business model, and establish strategic connections with both\ninternational and national construction material suppliers. These suppliers will play a pivotal role in ensuring the\navailability of innovative materials at competitive prices as well as training MSMEs on the proper techniques to use\nthe material, respecting required standards.\nActivity 3.2.3: Develop two inclusive, locally-tailored sustainable construction sector development plans,\nemphasizing energy efficiency and eco-friendly practices.\nITC will actively engage local construction MSMEs and community representatives in target areas to develop\nsustainable development plans. These plans will prioritize energy-efficient and eco-friendly practices through clear\ngoal-setting, actionable steps, and capacity-building initiatives. They will also promote respect of construction\nstandards, safety and disaster resilience. We will identify specific needs for training and material support through\ncomprehensive needs assessments. Ongoing monitoring and documentation will ensure adaptability and provide\nvaluable insights for the construction sector's long-term sustainability in these areas. These plans will be aligned with\nthe national strategy devised under 3.1 and will support its implementation locally.\nActivity 3.2.4: Definition of the technical designs for the climate-adaptive retrofit products and associated quality\nstandards and certification processes in partnership with government and private sector.\nThe implementation of this activity involves a collaborative effort bringing together local and international\narchitects, builders, material suppliers, academia, government, and other stakeholders. This collective initiative will\nbuild on the market opportunities and possible options identified under 3.2.1 to develop climate-smart and cost-\neffective technical designs and packages tailored for Iraqi Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to retrofit\nexisting buildings. These designs may encompass various sustainability elements, including enhanced insulation,\nenergy efficiency, sealing, shade structures, natural ventilation, reflective painting, cool roofing, and solar energy\n\n58\nsolutions. The goal is to create standardized and pre-agreed fixed-cost packages making sustainable retrofitting\naccessible and affordable for MSMEs while addressing climate challenges. To ensure technical quality, the initiative\nincludes the establishment of rigorous standards, certifications, checklists, and validation processes.\nActivity 3.2.5: Creation of an incentive program and social marketing for the adoption of the climate adaptation\nretrofit packages by consumers.\nMore than 200 households are set to benefit from climate-adaptive housing retrofit packages delivered by MSME\nmembers of the Alliances, showcasing their tangible value and the economic returns achieved through energy\nefficiency savings. To encourage early adoption and utilize these initial households as model homes to convince\nneighbours, we will introduce an incentive program covering 50% of the retrofit costs for the first 50 families in each\narea during the first year. This incentive will gradually decrease to 25% in the second year and will be phased out\nentirely after year three. Additionally, specific marketing efforts will be deployed to raise awareness, generate\ninterest, and demonstrate the economic returns of this sustainable investment to the broader community.\nActivity 3.2.6: Support to commercial delivery of the housing retrofit packages by local Alliance MSMEs building\non capacity strengthening effort under output 3.3 and quality insurance and certification mechanisms set under\nactivity 3.2.4.\nThis activity focuses on providing comprehensive support to the commercial delivery of housing retrofit packages by\nlocal Alliance Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Building upon the capacity strengthening efforts\noutlined in Output 3.3 and guided by the quality assurance and certification mechanisms established in Activity 3.2.4,\nthis activity ensures that trained MSMEs and young entrepreneurs possess the necessary skills to proficiently\nimplement the retrofit packages developed under Activity 3.2.4. Collaborative partnerships with material suppliers\nare integral, facilitating the exchange of expertise and technical standards required for effective package installation.\nAdditionally, a robust certification mechanism, a product of Activity 3.2.4, guarantees that only certified installers\nare engaged and that external verification maintains the quality of installation at the highest standards. This\ncoordinated approach reinforces the successful and reliable commercial delivery of housing retrofit solutions while\nbolstering the capacity of local enterprises and entrepreneurs.\nOutput 3.3: Strengthened capacities of local businesses, particularly young entrepreneurs, for the integration of\ngreen and innovative practices in their operation.\nOutput 3.3 of the project focuses on strengthening the capacity of local businesses, with a particular emphasis on\nyoung entrepreneurs, to incorporate green and innovative practices into their operations. This output recognizes\nthe importance of enhancing the skills and knowledge of entrepreneurs to drive sustainability and innovation within\nthe local business landscape. Here are some key points and strategies outlined in this output:\nThe project acknowledges that small businesses, especially micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs),\nare vital components of the local economy. Therefore, efforts will be directed towards these businesses to help them\nbuild capacity in sustainable and innovative practices with a specific focus on youth.\nTo achieve the desired outcomes, the project will work on reinforcing the portfolio of business development service\nproviders. These providers will offer training, coaching, and mentoring services to young entrepreneurs and small\nbusinesses particularly in areas such as climate smart solutions, and innovative construction technology, among\nothers. An important aspect of this output is the exposure to good practices from peers. This learning from both\ninstitutional and company-level peers can be invaluable in helping entrepreneurs understand and implement\nsustainable and innovative practices effectively. The project will ensure a close look at reaching out to relevant\npartners. The project recognizes the role of youth in economic empowerment and job creation. It aims to not only\nsupport new entrepreneurs but also provide existing MSMEs with the necessary skills to grow. This involves\ncollaboration with sector stakeholders and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) providers.\nTo stay relevant and meet the evolving demands of the market, the project will focus on better aligning current TVET\nprograms with the specific needs of businesses. This ensures that the training provided is practical and directly\napplicable to the industry and the value chain analysis will feed this process.\n\n59\nCollaboration and partnerships will be key to the success of this output. These partnerships may involve recognized\nmultinational corporations, training institutions, and other industry stakeholders. Such collaborations can facilitate\nknowledge transfer, keep pace with market changes, and help build skills that align with the identified value chains.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 3.3.1: Design and implement short modular competency-based trainings for professionals on new\naffordable house construction, repairs, resource efficiency, financial literacy.\nThis activity is focused on designing and implementing short modular competency-based training programs for\nprofessionals in the areas of new affordable house construction, repairs, resource efficiency, and financial literacy.\nThis activity aims to provide targeted and practical training to professionals, equipping them with the knowledge\nand skills needed for sustainable and innovative practices in these areas. The first step in this activity involves\nidentifying key stakeholders who will be involved in the design and implementation of the training programs. These\nstakeholders may include experts in energy efficiency, construction, repair, and financial literacy, as well as\nrepresentatives from relevant institutions and organizations. Focus group discussions will be conducted to gather\ninsights and inputs from professionals to shape the content of such training. Based on the insights gained from focus\ngroup discussions and in collaboration with key stakeholders, the project will co-design the training modules. That\ncould cover various topics, such as: new affordable house construction techniques that emphasize sustainability and\nresource efficiency; repair and maintenance practices that reduce environmental impact; strategies for improving\nresource efficiency in construction and repair projects; Financial literacy modules. Training modules on financial\nliteracy may be customized based on existing materials or resources, or they can be developed in collaboration with\nrelevant partners who specialize in financial education. The roll out of these materials will have an objective of 200\nusers.\nActivity 3.3.2: Develop partnerships with construction material supplier, universities, and innovators to\nmainstream climate smart solutions in Iraq.\nThis activity focuses on the development of strategic partnerships with various stakeholders to promote and\nmainstream climate-smart solutions in Iraq's construction sector. This activity recognizes the importance of\ncollaboration with key players in the value chain to drive sustainability and innovation. The first step in this activity\nis to engage with relevant stakeholders in the construction and housing sector that were already identified as part\nof the value chain analysis. These stakeholders may include construction material suppliers, universities, innovators,\nand other organizations that play a role in the value chain. Once key stakeholders are identified, the project will\nwork on establishing partnerships with them. These partnerships can take various forms, including: sharing of\neducational resources related to climate-smart solutions and sustainable construction practices; access to cutting-\nedge technologies, materials, and solutions that promote sustainability in construction. Collaboration with\nuniversities or incubators can involve supporting research and innovation projects related to climate-smart\nconstruction solutions. In addition to partnerships with stakeholders directly involved in the construction sector, this\nactivity may extend collaboration to Financial Service Providers (FSPs) at the national or international levels. Building\nand maintaining strong partnerships is an ongoing process. The project will focus on nurturing these relationships,\nfostering collaboration, and ensuring that the partnerships remain productive and mutually beneficial over time.\nActivity 3.3.3: Co-establish pilot training sites and model houses using innovative affordable green techniques in\ncollaboration with UN-Habitat\nITC will collaborate with UN-Habitat (under Output 2.6) to establish pilot training sites and model houses. This\nactivity will showcase innovative and affordable green techniques. These sites serve as practical learning\nenvironments and examples for students, professionals, and the community at large. The project will collaborate\nclosely with a range of stakeholders, including locally established vocational training centers, private sector partners,\nuniversities, incubators, practitioners, and relevant government ministries. The objective of this multi stakeholder\nengagement is to create physical spaces where innovative and affordable green techniques are put into practice.\nThese pilot training sites and model houses will serve as living examples of sustainable construction and design. The\nproject team, in consultation with experts and stakeholders, will select specific green techniques and practices that\nalign with the project's goals. These techniques may include energy-efficient building methods, sustainable\n\n60\nmaterials, renewable energy integration, waste reduction, and water conservation, among others. Physical locations\nfor the pilot training sites and model houses will be identified and secured. The pilot training sites will serve as hands-\non learning environments for students and professionals. Training programs and educational activities will be\nconducted on-site to demonstrate and teach the application of green techniques. This can include workshops,\nseminars, and practical demonstrations. The model houses and pilot sites will act as showcases for innovative and\naffordable green solutions. They will demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of these techniques, encouraging\nbroader adoption within the construction industry and community.\nActivity 3.3.4: Strengthen the capacities of key support organizations working with MSMEs particularly youth-led\ncompanies with new services particularly in entrepreneurship and financial literacy.\nActivity 3.3.4 focuses on strengthening the capacities of key support organizations that work with Micro, Small, and\nMedium Enterprises (MSMEs), particularly those led by young entrepreneurs. This activity aims to provide these\nsupport organizations with the necessary tools and resources to offer new and improved services, with a specific\nfocus on entrepreneurship and financial literacy. Here's a breakdown of the key components of this activity: Support\nwill be provided to selected organizations to enhance their operational and service delivery capacities in the above-\nmentioned areas. These services may include mentoring and coaching for young entrepreneurs, workshops on\nbusiness planning and management, access to financial education, and assistance in securing financing. Efforts will\nbe made to foster collaboration and synergies among different support institutions. This ensures complementarity\nand shared efforts in supporting the competitiveness of the value chain and promoting entrepreneurship and\nclimate-smart solutions. Collaboration may involve joint initiatives, knowledge sharing, and resource pooling.\nActivity 3.3.5: In collaboration with local alliances create a system of certified trainees, a repository, regular\nnetworking events, and associated marketing.\nThis activity aims at establishing a system to certify trainees, create a repository of resources, organize regular\nnetworking events, and implement associated marketing efforts in collaboration with local alliances. This activity is\ncrucial for sustaining and expanding the impact of the project's efforts to strengthen the capacity of local businesses,\nespecially young entrepreneurs, in integrating green and innovative practices into their operations. This component\ninvolves setting up a certification process for individuals who have completed the training and capacity-building\nprograms offered as part of the project. A repository or database will be created to store training materials, guides,\nmanuals, case studies, and other resources related to green and innovative practices. This repository will serve as a\nvaluable knowledge base for trainees, professionals, and entrepreneurs seeking information and guidance. Effective\nmarketing efforts will be put in place to promote the project's activities, training programs, and networking events.\nMarketing strategies may include digital and traditional marketing channels, outreach to local media, and leveraging\npartnerships with local alliances to reach a wider audience.\nOutput 3.4: Improved regulatory and legal framework for access to and provision of construction and housing\nservices in Iraq.\nAn enabling framework for service providers (businesses and investors) to engage in construction and housing\nservices in Iraq has the potential to contribute to improvements in housing affordability and sustainability, including\nthrough the more active involvement of MSMEs in these sectors.\nAccess to construction and housing services and effective functioning of such service providers is instrumental to\naddressing Iraq’s housing crisis. Increasing opportunities for service providers in this sector to operate in Iraq and\nthe functioning of various service providers in this space would allow for a more competitive sector – thus creating\nthe impetus for better quality and competitively priced services within the housing and construction sector in Iraq.\nA preliminary assessment revealed restrictions in the ability of service providers in this sector to operate across the\nmodes of supply of services (i.e. the four modes through which services are traded: Cross-border trade – Mode 1;\nConsumption abroad - Mode 2; Commercial presence – Mode 3; and Temporary movement of natural persons –\nMode 4). Restrictions were identification in the context of the setting up a commercial presence in the country,\naccessing services abroad, and bringing in foreign labour/skills needed for these services. Among others, regulatory\nchallenges identified include the disjunct between the legal framework and practical implementation creating space\n\n61\nfor uneven implementation of laws and informal mechanisms; restrictions in foreign participation in the sector,\nability for foreign ownership of land, and the lack of harmonization and coordination of procurement practices.\nActivities to strengthen the regulatory and legal framework on market access for construction and housing services\nin the country under Output 3.4 will assist with policy mapping, analysis and planning, dialogue and implementation\nthrough targeted capacity building and the organisation of suitable platforms for discussion and coordination. Across\nthese activities, the sharing of international expertise and best practices will be led by local stakeholders to address\ntheir concerns, progress towards the goals they set as priorities, and match the capacities of implementing\ninstitutions.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 3.4.1: Undertake detailed mapping of regulatory and legislative measures governing the (a) entry and\noperation of service providers in the housing and construction sectors in Iraq (including in terms of access to set\nup/engage in operations, engagement of foreign professionals, operation and participation in public-private\npartnerships in the sector), and (b) bidding/qualifying for procurement offers in housing and construction related\nprojects (including in terms of the process adopted to prepare, issue, and evaluate tenders, and award contracts).\nThe mapping of Iraq’s regulatory and legislative measures is a necessary first step to undertake a regulatory\nassessment of Iraq’s construction and housing sector (Activity 3.4.2). The mapping will include both horizontal and\nsectoral laws and regulations governing these sectors. Horizontal laws are those which apply to all service providers\n(such as investment law, companies act, labour laws, immigration laws, land law, procurement etc.), which are likely\nto include restrictions on transfer of funds, limitations on movement of people, caps on foreign equity participation,\netc.; while the sectoral laws covered those which govern the particular industry (such as construction law), as well\nas at the sector-specific level which govern particular activities (such as the practice of architecture and engineering).\nThe objective of the mapping is to collect and tabulate all the regulations and legislations that impact Iraq’s in\npreparation to undertake the regulatory assessment. Building upon the preliminary mapping undertaken,\nconsultations will be undertaken with relevant stakeholders to confirm/validate the laws/regulations/measures\nidentified and ensure that all relevant measures governing this sector including any provincial level\nregulations/measures are covered in the mapping.\nActivity 3.4.2: Conduct regulatory impact assessments for the regulatory/legal measures governing the entry and\noperation of service providers in the housing and construction sectors in Iraq (identified from the mapping\nengagement above).\nThe objective of this activity is to critically assess the effects of proposed and existing regulations (drawn from the\nmapping exercise in Activity 3.4.1) in order to ensure that regulations are efficient and effective to achieve the overall\nobjective. This is because certain laws such as the regulation placing limits on foreign participation in the market,\nfunction as a trade restrictive measure and therefore impact on services and investments in Iraq. Policy makers\nshould assess, when designing policies/laws/regulations, the likely impacts and consequences of such measures, and\nregulatory impact assessments are a useful framework that can be adopted to assess regulations and ensure that it\nmeets the overarching objectives.\nAccordingly, through this activity, ITC will support relevant stakeholders in Iraq to develop a framework for\nundertaking regulatory impact assessments in the abovementioned sectors, drawing from the ‘OECD’s Best Practice\nPrinciples for Regulatory Policy’. (Capacity building based on this framework will be undertaken in Activity 3.4.3\nbelow).\nBased on this framework, ITC will work with relevant institutions to select key laws/regulations/policies, as mapped\nin Activity 3.4.1 above, and assess the impact of these measures so as understand whether it achieves the intended\nobjectives and how it impacts the operation of construction and housing services and investments into this sector.\nBased on these assessments, and demand from the Government of Iraq, technical assistance can then be provided\nto support Iraq’s policy makers to undertake necessary policy and regulatory reforms.\n\n62\nActivity 3.4.3 Provide capacity building for officers in relevant institutions on undertaking regulatory impact\nassessments – to be applied for future regulatory developments – including through development of a technical\nguide and practical training sessions.\nGuidelines will be formulated based on the strategy discussed above on undertaking regulatory impact assessments\nfor the construction/housing sector related laws/regulations/policies. These guidelines will serve to function as a\ntoolkit that can be used for officers for existing and future laws/regulations/policies – with the objective of\ncontribution to efforts to promote evidence-based policy making.\nCapacity building sessions will be organized for relevant institutions based on these guidelines; and practical sessions\nheld with relevant officers by working with ITC on the selected measures for the assessment under Activity 3.4.2.\nActivity 3.4.4: Undertake diagnostic assessment of the alignment of the procurement framework governing\nconstruction and housing sectors with international guidelines/best practices governing transparency, integrity,\nand accountability of procurement processes.\nPreliminary analysis undertaken revealed a lack of harmonization and coordination on procurement practices across\ngovernment organizations – with regard to procurement, methods, information contained in tender documents,\nadvertising periods, etc. With regards to procurement within the construction and housing sectors, it is important\nfor strong coordination and alignment between the activities of the Ministry of Planning and Development\nCooperation (which is the main agency responsible for public contracts in Iraq) and the Ministry of Construction,\nHousing and Public Municipalities (which oversees procurement of construction services). An assessment\nundertaken by OECD in 2008 reviewed the general public procurement framework and provided pertinent\ninterventions to enhance transparency, integrity, and accountability. Since then, further developments have taken\nplace in the regulatory framework governing public procurement.\nHaving in place a well-functioning public procurement framework that promotes transparency and accountability is\nan important factor to attract investments into the sector and ensure that quality services are made available for\nconstruction and housing services in the country. In this context, drawing from international guidelines/best\npractices in relation to public procurement, drawing from the WTO’s Government Procurement Agreement (GPA),\nthe EU's Integrity Pact Toolbox, among others, as well as sector specific guidelines such as the Construction Sector\nTransparency Initiative, to build understanding and capacitate stakeholders to work towards a more conducive and\nenabling public procurement framework.\nLinked with the capacity building initiatives under Activity 3.4.5, ITC will work with relevant institutions to undertake\nan assessment of Iraq’s public procurement framework being adopted for construction services. The assessment will\nreview the regulatory framework and process adopted in place to prepare, issue and evaluate tenders, and award\nof contracts for the construction and housing related projects – with the objective of assessing the extent to which\nthe existing framework is aligned with OECD recommendations and related international guidelines pertaining to\ntransparency and accountability as noted above.\nActivity 3.4.5: Provide capacity building for officers on international guidelines/best practices in procurement\nprocesses with a view to foster alignment of Iraq’s procurement processes in the housing and construction sectors.\nLinked with the technical intervention in Activity 3.4.4 above, targeted capacity building initiatives will also be\nundertaken for Iraq’s officers in the abovementioned ministries as well as other agencies identified from the\nassessment, on best practices in public procurement with specific focus on procurement contexts for construction\nand infrastructure related services. This will include training events (virtual and in-person) to raise awareness on\nbest practices/guidelines available in relation to public procurement and integrating these lessons into the public\nprocurement frameworks in Iraq for construction and housing services.\nActivity 3.4.6: Provide technical/advisory support to undertake regulatory reforms – based on the impact\nassessments and diagnostic assessment.\n\n63\nBased on the results of the regulatory and diagnostic assessments undertaken through Activities 3.4.2 and 3.4.4\nrespectively, technical assistance can be provided for relevant government agencies, based on demand, to prioritise\nand implement recommendations to facilitate regulatory and institutional reforms.\nRelevant interventions can be in the form of providing technical inputs to draft/amend laws/regulations, and\nstrategize reforms to strengthen coordination among government agencies, improve transparency, etc.\nActivity 3.4.7: Organize public-private dialogues (built into the activities covered above) to present and discuss\nregulatory and policy reforms to strengthen access to the construction and housing services sectors in Iraq,\nincluding in the context of integrating broad developmental priorities such as sustainability and digitalization into\nthe industry.\nPPDs will be built into the technical activities to present and discuss findings, seek inputs/clarifications, and obtain\nvalidation on policy recommendations/insights formulated.\nThese dialogues function as an important platform for all relevant stakeholders from public and private sectors to\nbe informed about the studies/analyses underway, seek buy-in from stakeholders to engage in these efforts, and\nfacilitate dialogue between public and private sectors on policy reforms, so as to ensure that all stakeholders are\neffectively engaged in the policy formulation and implementation process.\nThe PPDs effectively provide an opportunity to inform the reform process through inclusive consultation as well as\nto validate the results of the studies; and ensure that stakeholders are actively engaged in decision making to\nstrengthen the regulatory and policy framework governing the construction and housing services sector in Iraq.\nActivity 3.4.8: Provide capacity building engagements for public and private sector (including economic operators,\nprofessional associations, business associations, etc.), and the academia/civil society on market access issues\nrelating to services trade – with focus on the construction and housing services sector (covering issues such as the\nmodalities of services trade, and potential from services liberalization, technicalities of MRAs, etc.).\nTo ensure that all relevant stakeholders relevant for strengthening the construction and housing services sector in\nIraq are able to provide meaningful inputs and effectively engage in the reform process, it is important that these\nstakeholders understand their role in the services framework and the relevance of their engagement in contributing\nto a conducive business environment for these services. As explained above, there are a number of different\nareas/topics which have an impact on the operation of the construction and housing services sector, and accordingly,\nit is important to ensure that all these various stakeholders understand their position in this reform process.\nThrough this activity, capacity building engagements will be undertaken for the various stakeholders (identified\nbased on the mapping undertaken in Activity 3.4.1) to understand the operation of trade in services (including the\nmodalities, potential from services liberalization, technicalities of MRAs, etc.) and explore these concepts within the\nframework of the construction and housing services sector. Targeted sessions can be held with stakeholders from\nspecific institutions, based on request, to dive into these concepts and build linkages with authorities in the\nconstruction and housing sectors.\nGuides, infographics and related resources will be developed under this activity, to feed into the capacity building\ninitiatives. This activity will also see the development of guides, infographics and other resources. The most suitable\nmodality of capacity building will be decided based on the needs of the stakeholders.\nOutput 3.5: Enhanced awareness and capacities of public and private stakeholders of the regulatory and\nprocedural framework for investing in the housing and construction sectors and potential for reform.\nInvestment is a key driver of the construction and housing sector growth in Iraq. Increased investment –\ndomestic and foreign – will lead to increased jobs and income for the workers in these sectors, improved\naccess to finance, increased efficiency, as well as greater adoption of new technologies and sustainable\nbusiness models.\n\n64\nBeyond economic fundamentals such as market access conditions, and returns on investment, investment related\nadministrative procedures also play a key role in investment decisions. These may include measures/procedures\nrelated to company establishment and business registration, connecting to infrastructure, capital transfers and\npayments, payment of taxes, benefitting from incentives and public programmes, among others.\nIraq has adopted legal and regulatory reforms to encourage foreign investment and improve the business climate,\nincluding through the promulgation of the Investment Law and establishment of the National Investment\nCommission (NIC). The NIC, in turn, has established a one stop shop to function as a single point of contact for\ninvestors and facilitate the investment process through streamlined services. However, significant challenges remain\nmaking it challenging for investors seeking to engage in the construction and housing sectors in Iraq. Some challenges\nidentified from the preliminary analysis include the complexity and lack of clarity of regulations, predictability of the\npolicy environment, lack of coordination among government agencies, lack of transparency, and the complex and\ntime-consuming administrative procedures to be complied with. These challenges are not unique to Iraq, and efforts\nhave been pursued through domestic reforms or international agreements such as the WTO Investment Facilitation\nfor Development (IFD) Agreement to improve transparency and streamline administrative procedures to make\ninvestment processes easier, faster, and safer.\nAccordingly, interventions are designed under Output 3.5 to strengthen Iraq’s investment facilitation measures,\ndrawing from international guidelines, with the objective to increase flow of domestic and foreign investment into\nthe housing and construction sectors.\nOutput 3.5 engages public and private stakeholders to improve the policy environment for facilitating investments\ninto the housing and construction sectors, and in turn, expanding access to housing and potential of small firms in\nthe sector to meaningfully contribute to job creation and facilitate sustainable industrial growth. Through targeted\nactivities on building awareness, assessing needs, analysing potential reforms to administrative processes and\nregulations, and providing comprehensive capacity building, stakeholders will be equipped with the necessary tools\nto attract and engage potential investors.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 3.5.1: Determine the core group of stakeholders for investment facilitation, including participants from\nboth public and private sector.\nInvestment facilitation measures (as reflected in the WTO IFD Agreement) cover a broad scope of laws and\nregulations on various elements – and accordingly, it is crucial for the country to identify all governmental agencies\ndirectly involved in the whole life cycle of investment at both national and sub-national levels. These agencies will\nneed to be part of the assessment process (undertaken in Activity 3.5.2 and 3.5.4) – and form the core stakeholder\ngroup for implementing investment facilitation measures. In addition to the core stakeholder group, it is also\nnecessary to engage other stakeholders, both governmental and non-governmental, involved in the whole life cycle\nof an investment – which can include foreign and domestic investors, research institutes, civil society organizations\nthat have a practical and ground level knowledge and experience that enables them to provide inputs from various\nperspectives. Key agencies already identified include the National Investment Commission, Provincial Investment\nCommission, the Ministry of Trade’s Companies Registration Department, Kurdistan Board of Investment, Chamber\nof Commerce, and the Council of Ministers.\nAccordingly, a mapping will be undertaken of the various government agencies linked to/relevant for overseeing the\nimplementation of measures/procedures set out in the WTO IFD Agreement; and identification of other relevant\nstakeholders (from private sector and civil society) who can be engaged in the process. The core group of\nstakeholders will occupy an important role in the needs assessment and business process analysis – as the\ninformation collected and analysis formulated will need to be reviewed and confirmed by all relevant agencies\ninvolved in the implementation process. The overall process will have to be led by a national coordinating agency –\nwhich will be identified in consultation with relevant agencies.\nThe mapping will be undertaken through a combination of desk research, and stakeholder consultations and focus\ngroup discussion(s) to present the mapping and seek validation/inputs from the relevant stakeholders. In addition,\n\n65\nthere will be a sub-core group within the overall core stakeholder group comprising stakeholders directly engaged\nin the construction and housing services industry. The sub-core group will not necessarily be mutually exclusive from\nthe overall core stakeholder group – as there may be overlaps in the stakeholders engaged (For instance the National\nInvestment Commission, and the Companies Registrar will be engaged in both groups).\nThese activities will be undertaken by investment facilitation expert(s) and a national investment expert (with\ncapacity to engage in Arabic language and build networks with relevant stakeholders).\nActivity 3.5.2: Provide capacity building and awareness-raising for the core group stakeholders to enhance their\nknowledge about the objectives and approaches for investment facilitation and the needs assessment.\nTo facilitate the assessment of investment facilitation measures under Activity 3.5.3 - capacity building initiatives\nwill be built in for the relevant stakeholders as identified in Activity 3.5.1 - to ensure that all stakeholders are well-\nversed and capacitated to engage effectively in this process.\nThe Needs Assessment Guide for Investment Facilitation – formulated by the WTO to enable self-assessments – and\nother related materials will be circulated to all stakeholders in advance of the assessment – with the objective of\nproviding a good foundation and to ensure comprehensive discussion among stakeholders.\nFollowing this, targeted capacity building sessions will be organized in collaboration with the national coordinating\nagency and the core stakeholder group to build understanding on the context of investment facilitation and related\nmeasures, and process for strengthening investment facilitation using the Needs Assessment Guide as a template.\nTechnical sessions will then be facilitated on each of the sections of the Needs Assessment Guide for Investment\nFacilitation – to work through each provision, provide examples on how each provision can be implemented, and\ndiscuss its application in Iraq.\nThrough these sessions, the objective will be to ensure that all stakeholders relevant for the investment facilitation\nprocess are well-versed on the relevant matters and able to provide solid and useful inputs to feed into the needs\nassessment process effected under Activity 3.5.3.\nActivity 3.5.3: Undertake a needs assessment of the investment facilitation framework in Iraq – based on the\nguidelines developed based on the WTO Investment Facilitation for Development (IFD) Agreement.\nAt the initial training undertaken in Activity 3.5.2, participants will be invited to fill in a pre-assessment survey to\ncollect preliminary inputs on relevant procedures/measures, as set out in the Needs Assessment Guide formulated\nby the WTO. The Needs Assessment Guide is structured into four main sections – (a) transparency of investment\nmeasures; (b) streamlining and speeding up administrative procedures; (c) focal points, domestic regulatory\ncoherence and cross-border cooperation; and (d) sustainable investment. Participants will not be required to provide\ncomprehensive answers and may provide partial answers focusing on their areas of expertise. The survey will serve\nas a foundation for group discussion in the in-country self-assessment.\nThereafter, technical support will be provided to work through and complete information on each of the sections of\nthe Guide and identify challenges/constraints and areas for reform. Consultations will be built into the targeted\ncapacity building sessions discussed in Activity 3.5.2 above, to present preliminary inputs received from the pre-\nassessment survey and obtain inputs/information from the stakeholders on the relevant\nlaws/regulations/procedures pertaining to each of the articles covered in the section.\nThis will be complemented with an in-depth study based on the information collected from the stakeholder group,\nfurther desk research and consultations, to review the laws/regulations/administrative requirements and the\npractical implementation, assess challenges/constraints identified, and compile information into the needs\nassessment guide. The compiled assessment will be shared with the national coordinating agency for review,\nconsultations held to present the findings, and seek confirmation on the information gathered and analysed\npertaining to the relevant laws/regulations/measures.\nDialogues will be organized under Activity 3.5.7 to present the findings of the assessment to the core stakeholder\ngroup – to seek inputs and validation on the analysis of the challenges/constraints identified – and discuss potential\n\n66\npolicy reforms in this regard (refer to Activity 3.5.7 for further details). The needs assessment will be further refined\nbased on feedback received at these dialogues.\nA final report will be prepared with an overall analysis of the investment facilitation framework in Iraq,\nchallenges/constraints faced, and policy recommendations to streamline and strengthen investment facilitation\nmeasures in the country.\nActivity 3.5.4: Undertake a business process analysis study on the administrative/procedural steps and relevant\nagencies involved in the process for investing in and setting up operations in the housing and constructions sectors\nin Iraq.\nThe business process analysis study will, draw from the investment facilitation analysis, and then dive into the\nspecific administrative procedures in the housing and construction sectors, with the aim of identifying redundancies\nand undue complexities, assess mechanisms, quality, and effectiveness of procedures, and propose suggestions for\npractical reform.\nThis will entail a mapping of the value chain in the housing and construction sector, identifying relevant steps in the\ninvestment process, procedures for setting up a company in Iraq (both as a foreign and domestic investor) in the\nconstruction and housing industry, required authorizations and agencies in charge, time required for obtaining\nauthorization, fees and charges, time and costs associated with obtaining local services required to undertake\nconstruction and related services.\nThe results of this mapping will also be used to feed into the formulation of a sub-core group within the core\nstakeholder group set out in Activity 3.5.1; and further targeted sessions will be conducted for stakeholders in the\nsub-core group pertaining directly to the construction and housing services sectors to explain the context of\ninvestment facilitation in the framework of the particular industry. Relevant stakeholders identified from the\npreliminary analysis undertaken by ITC in this regard include the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation,\nMinistry of Labour, General Directorate of Real Estate, and the Iraqi Syndicate of Engineers.\nAn analysis of the application of the procedures identified from the mapping exercise will be undertaken – through\ndesk research, consultations/focus group discussion, etc. – to assess/identify options to streamline procedures,\nenhance collaboration among agencies, reduce required authorizations, and digitize documentation requirements,\nand improve transparency and reduce corruption.\nA final report will be prepared to present the overall findings, detail the procedures and challenges/constraints\nidentified, and provide policy recommendations to streamline, build collaboration and smoothen the process in the\nconstruction and housing sector.\nThe investment facilitation experts referred to above, will be supported by a local expert in the construction and\nhousing services sector for this activity.\nActivity 3.5.5: Develop an investment guide (which can be integrated into an online platform) on the\nsteps/procedures to invest and set up operations in the construction and housing sectors in Iraq.\nAn investment guide will be developed providing step-by-step guidance for investors seeking to engage in Iraq. The\nguide will detail in a logical manner – the procedures for to set up and operate a business in in Iraq – including\nmeasures for registering labour, engaging foreign employees, registering tax profile, claiming incentives, etc.\nUpon development of the investment guide – an event will be organized to present and launch the investment guide\n(potentially in collaboration with events organized under Activity 3.5.8) – with the objective of showcasing and\npromoting the efforts of the Iraqi Government to strengthen the investment framework for the construction and\nhousing sector.\nActivity 3.5.6: Deliver capacity building for public and private sector stakeholders on investment facilitation and\nstrengthening investment frameworks, including in the context of aligning investment frameworks with emerging\ntrends such as sustainability and digitalization, drawing on best practices/lessons learned from other jurisdictions\n– including targeted engagements for key stakeholders such as the National Investment Commission, Provincial\n\n67\nInvestment Commissions, and the Kurdistan Board of Investment, among others (based on a sustained\ntraining/capacity building plan to be developed at the start of the project).\nComplementing the targeted capacity building events for the core stakeholder group on investment facilitation,\nrelevant training/information-sharing materials will be developed such as infographics and video clips on related\ncontent – which can be circulated widely to reach a broader audience.\nIn addition, further targeted events will be organized for the core stakeholder group and other relevant stakeholders\nfrom the public and private sectors, to explore:\n- Developments in investment negotiations, covering multilateral and regional/bilateral agreements – and\nrelevance for Iraq, and importance of aligning investment policy to facilitate industrial development in the\ncountry.\n- Best practices/lessons learned in leveraging investment policy to facilitate transition to digital and\nsustainable led industrial growth.\nThese events will seek to generate awareness of the public and private sector in Iraq on the importance of\nrefining/strengthening investment frameworks in line with emerging trends – to build competitiveness and attract\nsustainable private sector investments into the country.\nFor the topics referred to above, the content produced will be contextualised for the construction and housing\nindustry in Iraq, as relevant.\nTo feed into these training programmes, technical briefs will be developed on the topics mentioned above, to be\nshared with participants and can also be made available on online platforms to be accessible in public.\nActivity 3.5.7: Organize public-private dialogues to present and discuss regulatory and procedural reforms based\non the analyses.\nIn order to strengthen collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors in Iraq, and\nimportantly, to also ensure that private sector is engaged as an important stakeholder in the policy formulation and\nimplementation process in Iraq – public-private dialogues will be built in across the activities under Output 3.5.\nAs noted in Activity 3.5.1, 3.5.3 and Activity 3.5.4 above, public-private dialogues will be organized to present:\n- the mapping of relevant stakeholders undertaken for the studies under this Output, and\n- the findings of the self-assessment for investment facilitation framework in Iraq and the analysis of the\ninvestment process in the construction and housing sector in Iraq.\nThese dialogues will be a forum from which to familiarize stakeholders with the interventions being undertaken to\nstrengthen the investment facilitation framework for the construction and housing sector in Iraq, obtain\nfeedback/inputs on the analysis, facilitate discussion between public and private sectors on challenges/constraints\nfaced and feasibility of proposed policy recommendations, and seek agreement from stakeholders on the way\nforward.\nReports will be drawn upon based on each public-private dialogue organized to detail the discussion points covered\nin the dialogue, agreements reached between stakeholders, and set out the next steps. These reports will function\nas a record for the relevant government agencies and institutions to take action on policy reforms, and for private\nsector to be able to track and follow-up on relevant matters, including providing the necessary support to facilitate\nimplementation of the policy reforms.\nThese reports, upon sign off from the main government agency, can be circulated among all participants in the\npublic-private dialogue.\n\n68\nActivity 3.5.8: Develop tools for facilitating sustainable investment, including domestic supplier databases of\ndomestic services/material providers in the construction and housing value chains, so that investors can have\neasier access to information on available domestic services and suppliers.\nA domestic supplier database provides information about the availability and capacity of the local suppliers so that\ninvestors/foreign companies can have easier access to information and connect with the local suppliers. The supplier\ndatabase can be hosted on the website of the investment promotion agency (IPA), as part of IPA’s effort to promote\nlocal suppliers and connect them to markets. The supplier database can also serve as a tool to increase transparency\nin the market and help businesses assess competition and market conditions.\nThe tool will be made available in English and Arabic – for accessibility by local and foreign stakeholders. The\ndevelopment of the database will be effected in collaboration with the IPA with the objective of capacitating relevant\nofficials to take ownership of the database and keep it updated.\nActivity 3.5.9: Analysing and identifying countries with strong home country support measures in infrastructure/\nconstruction/housing sectors and developing targeted initiatives to attract investors from these countries.\nSome countries have strong home country support measures in infrastructure/ construction/housing sectors,\nincluding support to identify market opportunities (business intelligence and information on regulations), support\nto connect to public and private stakeholders including potential creditors, support on meeting regulatory and\nsustainability standards through trainings etc. These home country measures can help increase competitiveness as\nwell as ensure quality delivery. Home and host country IPAs can work together to exchange information on these\nsupport measures and develop targeted initiatives to benefit from home country measures, both for the investor\nand the local communities.\nITC’s experts will organize experience sharing sessions with IPAs in selected countries (to be identified based on\nresearch and consultations) to explore mechanisms/initiatives being implemented and exchange information in this\nregard. In line with these sessions, ITC will also develop a best practice guide on relevant support measures adopted\nby other selected jurisdictions and assess the feasibility for application in Iraq.\n4.6 RESULTS CHAIN OUTCOME FOUR\n4.6.1 OUTCOME FOUR: INTERVENTION LOGIC\nIf the awareness and technical capacities of social partners with regard to the right to organize, collective bargaining\nand the participation in social dialogue with public actors are improved (Op 4.1), then the influence on labour\nmarkets of employers’ and workers’ organisations involved in social dialogue with the government will be\nstrengthened (Oc. 4), as long as the representatives of social partners are committed to participate in the training\nand technical support provided; the members are also willing to implement the technical skills acquired to\nstrengthen their respective organizations further; and, social partners will exert concerted effort towards using\ndifferent advocacy platforms towards ensuring their rights to organize and collective bargaining.\n4.6.2 OUTCOME FOUR: DESCRIPTION\nStrengthened influence on labour markets of employers’ and workers’ organisations involved in social dialogue\nwith the government.\nThe ILO has proven experience in promoting social dialogue through consultative processes between social partners\nand government to shape labour markets and address labour-related issues all over the world. The ILO's work on\nstrengthening social partners' representativeness and institutional capacity is guided by its tripartite structure,\nwhere representatives from governments, employers' organizations, and workers' organizations collaborate on\nvarious programs and initiatives.\nThe ILO also works with governments, employers' organizations, and workers' organizations to strengthen their\ninstitutional capacities. This includes supporting the development of effective organizational structures, internal\ngovernance mechanisms, and strategic planning processes.\n\n69\nThe ILO also supports the right of workers and employers to form and join organizations of their choice taking its\ncatalyst role in promoting Freedom of Association (FoA), and advocates for the recognition and protection of\ncollective bargaining rights. By promoting freedom of association, the ILO fosters the creation of strong and\nrepresentative workers' and employers' organizations.\nOverall, the ILO's work focuses on empowering social partners to engage in social dialogue and consultative\nprocesses. By strengthening their representativeness and institutional capacity, the ILO aims to foster inclusive and\nparticipatory decision-making that leads to better labour market outcomes and improved working conditions for\nworkers.\nUnder this outcome, the ILO aspires to: supporting the national coordination mechanism to implement a roadmap\nto strengthen the application of the right to organize and collective bargaining; and supporting institutional capacity\nof the social partners to influence the labour market in the construction sector.\nFurthermore, beyond Outcome four, ILO, UN-Habitat and ITC have emmeshed engagement with CSO’s throughout\nthe project design (outcomes one, two, and three). CSO’s will be central to engaging in policy dialogues and valued\npartners on the ground - supporting with advocacy, outreach, awareness raising and implementation activities.\nCSO’s will be engaged in expert consultations, participatation in roundtable and participatory planning discussions,\nserve on technical working groups, and support community-level activities.\n4.6.3 OUTCOME FOUR: OUTPUTS AND ACTIVITIES\nOutput 4.1: A national coordination mechanism is established to implement the roadmap to strengthen the\napplication of the right to organize and collective bargaining.\nUnder this output, the ILO will provide technical support to the establishment of a national coordination mechanism\nto strengthen the application of Convention 98 - Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949,\nratified by the Government of Iraq which has been in force since 1962. This will be realized through development of\na roadmap which will be led by the collective effort of the tripartite constituents preceded by a comprehensive\nanalysis of gaps hindering workers and employers to join trade unions and employers’ organizations.\nThe ILO along with ILOITC-Turin, will provide technical assistance, training, and capacity-building programs to\ngovernments, employers' organizations, and workers' organizations.

TARGET AREAS, BENEFICIARIES, AND STAKEHOLDERS\n5.1 TARGET AREA SELECTION CRITERIA\nPilot locations will be selected following additional government consultations and during the inception phase, based\non consideration of a broad range of criteria measuring need, capacities to benefit from the project’s interventions,\nanticipated support, and representativeness:\no Unemployment rate.\no Poverty rate or other proxy for income.\no Level of housing deprivation (slum areas, informal settlements, lack of basic services, prevalence of\ndilapidated or destroyed housing).\no Governorates where affordable housing shortage for low-income households and/or vulnerable groups\n(IDPs, widows, disabled elderly) is demonstrable.\no Governorates that have overburdened infrastructure.\no Areas where housing developers and public construction are active.\no Presence of EU and other donor programs.\no GOI focus areas.\no Feasibility in implementation (established and good relations with local government and willingness to\ncollaborate).\no Demonstrated local capacity to implement (with some added technical assistance, if needed).\no Political willingness to pilot and implement an affordable housing programme, coupled with sufficient\nbudget allocation for the housing sector.\no Potential for high impact green interventions (design, building materials, energy efficiency installation and\nrenewables).\no Buildable land is available (or will be) and is well connected to jobs, transportation and other services and\namenities.\no New housing development (if applicable) has mixed-use and mixed income potential.\no Geographically representativeness (together, the selected regions represent diverse geographies and\npopulations).\n5.2 PROJECT BENEFICIARIES\nThe project intends to benefit the following direct and indirect beneficiaries:\no Young women and men, including IDPs who are seeking decent jobs in the construction and housing sectors.\nThrough the available data of jobs seekers within the Directorates of Labour and other local channels at\ntarget governorates, the project shall identify the most vulnerable people according to pre-determined\ncriteria together with project stakeholders and provide them with short to medium term opportunities.\nMinimum percentages of female workers and persons with disabilities shall be agreed upon at the\nidentification criteria.\no Unskilled and Semi-skilled workers in the construction sector obtaining new skills or upgrading their existing\nskills. In consultation with the Vocational Training Centres of MOLSA and other vocational training institutes\ninside target governorate, the project shall provide opportunities to improve workers’ skills through the\ninfrastructural interventions. The improvement of skills shall be supported by certification/ accreditation of\nthese skills to ensure long term advantages for workers benefited from these opportunities.\no Civil Society Organizations: Civil Society Organizations (CSOs): are diverse and encompass a wide range of\ncommunity-based organizations, child rights organizations, trade unions, research and policy think tanks,\nsocial and economic development NGOs, youth associations, women's rights groups. They can benefit from\nthis project in several ways: capacity building, advocacy support, networking opportunities, information\n\n73\nand research, participation in policy dialogue, monitoring and reporting, capacity for social dialogue\nEnhancing CSOs' capacity in areas such as freedom of association and collective bargaining empowers them\nto engage constructively in social dialogue with employers and government authorities.\no Children: The project's approach to combating child labour involves a multifaceted strategy that prioritizes\nthe well-being and development of children. Working closely with local communities, schools, and families,\nchild rights organizations and local authorities to identify and rescue children engaged in labour\nexploitation, ensuring their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.\no Social Housing Recipients: The primary recipient of housing units will include low-income and vulnerable\nhouseholds who are unable to obtain adequate and affordable housing through conventional market\nmechanisms. A structured beneficiary selection process will be devised which reflects area-based needs\nand entails detailed application and selection criteria. The housing provided will be centred around a needs-\nbased approach and will target resources and assistance accordingly. A set of basic requirements will be\nestablished that every beneficiary must fulfil (i.e., maximum income, does not already own a home). Priority\ngroups will be identified, and a points-based system will ensure that housing beneficiaries are among the\nmost vulnerable. A verification process will assess applicants' current living conditions in consideration of\ntheir family and economic circumstances in the context of the surrounding community. To maintain\ntransparency and clarity throughout the process, clear communication channels about the selection process\nand criteria will be established from the outset.

particular to ensure inclusive participation and no one is left behind. The Project\nuses a pro-poor approach that seeks to improve the right of poor families to adequate housing and youth\nemployment. Moreover, the Project adopts a participatory approach that will be implemented\nthroughout the phases of the Project. Community mobilizers will be working closely with the most\nvulnerable community groups to ensure that no one is left behind. Vulnerability criteria are included in\nthe selection of beneficiaries. Households with vulnerable members such as displaced persons, female\nheads, widows, elderly and/or persons with disabilities will be given priority in the selection process.\nEquity and inclusion of women: Iraqi culture encompasses various societal norms, laws, standards, and practices\nthat differ between men, women, boys, and girls. To address these distinctions, the project will undertake an in-\ndepth analysis of the diverse needs of beneficiary groups, including identifying potential obstacles to participation.\nThe project is committed to promoting the inclusion of women in stakeholder engagement activities, such as\ncommunity meetings, workshops, and training sessions, as well as in policy dialogues. To achieve this goal, deliberate\nefforts will be made to create platforms and opportunities that enable women to have a voice in local urban\ndevelopment and, when feasible, in the broader global urban agenda. Additionally, the project will actively strive to\npromote access to entry for women and prevent discriminatory practices, particularly in the realms of job creation,\nworking conditions, and the selection of housing beneficiaries.\nChildren, youth and the elderly: The project will put youth at the forefront of change where possible, acknowledging\nthe critical role of youth as a catalyst to more meaningful representation and decision making for future\nsustainability. This is done through engaging youth in skill development and policy dialogues. By engaging in\nemployment opportunities, MSME development, and construction work, youth will become self-reliant and\npositively impact Iraq’s efforts toward long-term development objectives. Children and youth will play a pivotal role\nin the ILO project's efforts to combat child labour in the construction sector. Through targeted awareness campaigns\nand community-based initiatives, the project will engage with children and youth, empowering them with\nknowledge about the hazards of child labour and the importance of education. Furthermore, youth will be\nencouraged to become advocates against child labour within their communities, amplifying the project's impact by\nspreading awareness and encouraging other children and families to prioritize education and safe alternatives to\nchild labour. By actively involving children and youth in the project's activities, it aims to not only rescue and\nrehabilitate child laborers but also foster a sense of agency and leadership among the younger generation,\ncontributing to a sustainable reduction in child labour in the construction sector.\nDisability: The project will pursue a disability inclusive approach through deliberate consultations with\npeople with disabilities on various aspects of the project (i.e., housing policy, housing design needs,\ninclusion in the labour market and construction sector). Further, the needs of people living with disabilities\nwill be fully considered in the construction of housing and communal spaces through a universal design\napproach. Other urban design factors such as, walkability and accessibility measures will be integrated\ninto urban design to ensure safe access all to buildings, facilities, and public space for the elderly, people\nliving with disabilities, children, and all alike.\nInternally Displaced Persons: Creating effective affordable housing projects and public works programs for internally\ndisplaced people (IDPs) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their immediate needs while also\nfostering long-term stability and self-sufficiency. The project will focus on internally displaced persons to re-integrate\nthem back to the labour market while addressing their housing needs. Pilot project locations will be selected in areas\nwhere stable jobs and housing situations can support in assuring security of tenure and in fostering social stability.\nThe most affected Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and host communities in Ninewa governorate will be\nconsidered while target beneficiaries are selected. The project will diligently strive to prioritize actions that promote\n\n79\nthe inclusion of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in policy dialogue and formulation, and in delivering\nprogrammatic activities. This includes advocacy efforts directed towards local and national government authorities.\nConflict Sensitivity: The proposed project places a strong emphasis on upholding protection and conflict-sensitivity\nprinciples and will adopt an area-based approach. In the initial stages, thorough analyses and assessments of conflict\nsensitivity risks will be conducted for each target area. This will ensure a comprehensive understanding of how the\nproject's planned activities will interact with the local context, taking into account factors like conflict drivers, sources\nof tension, and power structures. Measures to mitigate potential risks will be established before the project's\nactivities are implemented.\nThe project will also focus on assessing how its activities can contribute to promoting social cohesion within the\ncommunities it serves. Special attention will be given to the location of housing construction and in ensuring that\nhousing beneficiaries have secure tenure and are not vulnerable to displacement, thereby enhancing social stability\nand creating a safe living environment.\nThroughout its implementation, the project will strictly adhere to human rights, protection, and conflict sensitivity\nstandards, including international and Iraqi legal principles such as the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement\nand the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions. In cases where there are indications of increasing tensions during\nimplementation, the project will collaborate with social cohesion and peacebuilding stakeholders to identify\nappropriate strategies for addressing or mitigating these tensions. This may involve adapting project activities as\nnecessary to maintain a peaceful and secure environment.\nInclusive economic development: Private sector development and economic diversification will be needed to\nprovide sustainable enhancements to the wellbeing of Iraqis. Creating inclusive opportunities through work with\nsmall business and vulnerable groups will reinforce these developments. The project's activities on MSMEs, skill\ndevelopment, and employment will be designed to target women's economic empowerment and the creation of\nopportunities for youth and displaced persons in particular.\nClimate Change: The project aims to put addressing climate change at the forefront through integrating adaptive\nand mitigative measures, particularly in the construction of new housing, producing green jobs and in supporting\nSMES in adopting green business practices and measures. Housing construction will seek to reduce the carbon\nfootprint through careful site selection and applying compact and sustainable urban design principles as well as\nclimate sensitive architectural design and building materials, and integrating renewable and energy efficient\nmeasures where practical. It will also seek to strengthen the evidence base and understanding of the differentiated\nimpacts of climate change on men and women and the role of women as agents of change and on opportunities for\nwomen as per the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan. Proposed adaptation and mitigation strategies will be based on a\ngender analysis of risk, need, demand, barriers, and supply as per the EU Country Level Implementation Plan (2021-\n2025). Linkages to the OECD DAC RIO markers for climate change are as follows:\no Urban development and management - supports climate mitigation (2) - ‘compact town planning’ and\nadaptation (2) efforts ‘measures to counter overheating and climate vulnerabilities’. (Purpose code: 43030)\no Energy conservation and demand-side efficiency- supports both mitigation (2) and adaption (2) efforts-\nEfficiency in new construction (exceeding available standards) and retrofitting of existing buildings, e.g.,\nimproving the efficiency of air conditioning.

(Purpose code: 41082)\n\n80\n5.5 LEVERAGING PRIVATE INVESTMENT\nInsufficient attention has been given to the potential of private investment to support the faster expansion of\naffordable housing in Iraq. In addition to the underdevelopment of the financial sector, these investments are\ndiscouraged by uncertainties in the business environment. Increasing the involvement of the private sector in\naffordable housing thus requires concrete policy setting, an enabling regulatory framework, transparent and\ncoherent procurement processes, and the determination of appropriate level of subsidy and commensurate funding\nsources, enmeshed with the appropriate levels of risk sharing. The proposed project aims to develop these tools and\nmethodologies in collaboration with housing finance experts to determine appropriate private finance models in the\nIraqi context.\nIn order to maximize its impact and support the development of the private sector, the project will leverage\ninternational and domestic private investment to the greatest extent possible across all relevant activities. Activities\ndirectly targeting investment promotion and facilitation, and the improvement of the business climate for\ninvestment, will be complemented by cross-cutting efforts to further integrate private investment in the\nconstruction of affordable housing by working closely with private sector stakeholders. Specific outputs that will\nengage private sector expertise and engagement in policy dialogue, include:\n• Output 2.1: Revision of the National Housing Policy: The updated housing policy should reflect an enabling\napproach, fostering dialogue with private sector actors will collaboratively shape the policy framework and\ncould facilitate private investment playing a pivotal role filling the affordable housing deficit.\n• Output 2.2: Engaging the private sector in policy discussions concerning necessary regulatory and legislative\nreforms aimed at facilitating the expansion of both green and affordable housing production- can unlock\nsubstantial private investment, support in streamlining bureaucratic processes, and establish the private\nsector as an integral part of the affordable housing solution in Iraq.\n• Output 2.3: The creation of new affordable housing financing mechanisms: Collaborating with national and\ninternational housing finance experts to evaluate, assess and develop new green and affordable finance\nmechanisms, tailored to the Iraqi context, can help to unleash new investment opportunities that are\nfinancially sound and attractive to private investors.\n• Output 3.1: The design and implementation of a green sustainable housing sector development strategy:\nPolicy dialogue platforms involving private sector and other stakeholders are to be established to\ncollectively allow for the discussion of priorities for the medium term and establishment and pursuit of\nconcrete targets in these areas.\n• Outputs 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 include public-private dialogues on specific issues related to sustainable\ndevelopment and efficiency among SMEs active in housing and construction.\n• Output 3.5: Awareness raising on the investment framework: Support is to be provided on investment\nfacilitation, capacity building, and related areas to attract additional private sector investment.\n5.6 MOBILIZING PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT\nIn addition to leveraging private investment, the project will work to encourage – and support the more effective\nuse of – public sector investment in affordable housing through its work with policymakers and the agencies involved\nin housing and construction, including the strengthening of public-private linkages. This will further increase the\nimpact of the project’s activities and contribute to a lasting impact on housing.\nIn most countries, the public sector plays a formidable role in ensuring that a wide range of housing options are\navailable through concrete policy setting and the formulation of affordable housing programmes. Government\nintervention is particularly essential in countries where there is a marked absence of mature commercial banking\nsystems, construction sectors, and formal labour markets as is the case in Iraq. International examples demonstrate\nthat governments typically a play role, to some extent, in housing development and provision, whether it is to offer\naccess to financing, grants, or direct subsidies or program delivery or a combination as such. That said housing is\nexpensive and there will never be sufficient resources to address the housing needs for everyone. So, while\naffordable housing programmes almost always involve a good degree of government intervention, governments\n\n81\ntypically have limited funds and competencies needed to tackle the issue alone and thus, the private sector is\nbecoming increasingly important in structuring low-income housing programmes.\nIt is important to note in this regard that public spending plans in Iraq for the near future are outlined but not entirely\ncertain. The government’s most recent budget (for 2023-25) a replacement of previous annual budgets) provides\nsome more predictability for spending over the next three years. The budget outlines expenditures of IQD 199 trillion\n(USD $153 billion) and allocates IQD 49 trillion (USD $38 billion) to investment programmes. Within the investment\nproject budget, the GOI has provided significant allocations for projects contributing to poverty reduction ($1.23\nbillion) through financing the Iraq Fund for Development ($0.77 billion), Poverty Alleviation Strategy ($0.38 billion),\nand Poverty Projects ($0.08 billion). As far as sector specific allocations, the total allocation made to construction,\nhousing, and public municipalities is IQD 4,960 trillion ($3.79 billion), much of which IQD 3,784 billion ($2.89 billion)\nis in capital expenditure. Uncertainty remains, however. Expenditure beyond 2023 is not assured without more\nclarity on future resources or the composition of spending, and the extent of the alignment of spending with National\nDevelopment Plan (NDP) priorities is not clear (GIZ, 2023). The project partners will coordinate with government\ncounterparts to identify and secure appropriate budget sources that can be dedicated to affordable housing projects\n(poverty alleviation strategies or housing sector specific budget items) and Employment Intensive interventions. The\ndevelopment of local plans aligned with the NDP is essential to enable local communities to benefit from public\nfunds and investments, and the project will build the capacities of local partners at target governorates to align their\nplans with prioritized needs.\nIn previous decades, the GOI has undertaken several initiatives to address the nation’s housing challenges.\nUnfortunately, such efforts have largely fallen short in supporting those most in need. State sponsored housing has\ntypically been allocated to public employees through various Ministries, regardless of need or income. Furthermore,\nthe prevalence of corruption and nepotism has hindered efforts to effectively target lower-income beneficiaries.\nOften, those with strong connections tend to be the recipients of government sponsored housing and land programs.\nMore recently, the GOI has turned its attention to addressing housing through the “New Cities” investment projects.\nWhile this is a commendable step towards addressing the housing shortage, the prices of these housing units far\nsurpass what would be affordable to even moderate-income families. In this context, this proposed project will\nprovide technical support and capacity building to the GOI that not only aims to mobilize public resources but also\nto effectively target resources to realize the greatest societal impact. This comprehensive strategy involves:\n- Raising Awareness: The project will work on building awareness within the GOI about the pressing need for\naffordable housing.\n- Technical trainings: specialized training programs shall be delivered to GOI – technical authorities to design\ndevelopment plan on local level to identify infrastructural needs for housing sector and create decent jobs.\n- Setting Policy Goals: The project will assist in formulating policy objectives that explicitly address the\nhousing requirements of low-income and vulnerable populations. This will be achieved through legislative\nand regulatory reforms and through the modernization of the National Housing Policy.\n- Developing Financial Models: New financial models will be crafted to support the financial feasibility and\nexpansion of affordable housing production. This will include the identification of potential dedicated\nfunding streams for affordable housing as well as opportunities for private investment.\nFurthermore, the project will include a pilot initiative to create social housing units. This pilot will serve as a\ndemonstration of the concept that sustainable, cost-effective, and large-scale production of social housing in Iraq is\nindeed feasible when the available resources are utilized effectively.\n5.7 DEVELOPMENT PARTNER MAPPING\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2020 – 2024 and the new\nframework 2025 – 2029 is considered key instrument for the UN System to ensure a harmonized and collective\nresponse to national development challenges, as well as to support the national strategic plans related to the\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals/Agenda 2030. Implementing the UNSDCF through the UN\nCountry Team, in collaboration and coordination with the GOI, ensures that the implementation builds on existing\n\n82\nnational processes and contributes to the SDG planning of the GOI. The project will contribute to the UNSDCF on\ndifferent levels and outcomes, as well as building on other UN agencies planned and existing interventions.\nThe approach presented in this proposal aims to enhance and align with ongoing initiatives in Iraq while minimizing\nredundancy. It will endeavour to synergise with existing projects, leverage available resources, coordinate effectively\nwith other stakeholders, and adopt established methodologies through active collaboration and communication\nwith fellow development partners. Sustaining the backing and support of these development entities is deemed\ncrucial to achieving the project's goals. Consequently, the project will strive to integrate activities, harness existing\nexpertise, and capitalize on the achievements of partner organizations. The following development partners with\ncomplementary objectives are currently or recently active in Iraq include:\nNumerous development partners have actively participated in housing construction and rehabilitation efforts across\nareas impacted by conflict as part of post-conflict shelter reconstruction efforts. An interactive map and\ncomprehensive database can be found on the Global Shelter and UN-Habitat Cluster dashboard which includes\ndetailed geographic data on where partners are have or worked or are working and how many units they intend to\nbuild. Partners include UN agencies including UNDP, UNHCR, IOM and UN-Habitat as well other INGOs such as DRC,\nNRC and ACTED. Additionally, several Iraqi NGOs have played a role in shelter rehabilitation including local charity\norganizations. As of June 2022, close to 90k homes were targeted for rehabilitation or construction of which 58k\nhave been completed, the majority of which are in Mosul (16.4k), Ramadi (12k) and Falluja (7k). This project will\ncoordinate with the ongoing activities of the Housing HLP Sub-group partners and with the durable solutions\nmechanism and its partners organizations under the auspices the Durable Solutions Task Force in alignment with\nInter-Agency Durable Shelter Operational and Strategic Framework (2021)\nWhile partner agencies have produced significant numbers of housing units as part of the humanitarian response,\ntheir involvement in addressing deep-seated institutional deficiencies crucial for sustained, long-term reform has\nbeen limited. It is likely that as Iraq transitions from disaster response to comprehensive, enduring development\nagenda, partner engagement in housing initiatives may recede. On the policy front, the majority of housing related\nefforts have centred around research and publications, primarily carried out by entities such as the World Bank,\nUSAID, IOM, NRC and research institutes. This proposed project aims to take a direct approach through initiating\npolicy dialogue and building technical capacity of the government to foster a more mature and productive housing\nmarket that effectively tackles housing challenges on a long-term horizon.\n6. PROJECT MANAGEMENT\n6.1 INCEPTION PHASE\nThe project will begin with an inception phase of six months, which will serve as a foundational period for the project,\nwhere the project's activities, partnerships, resources are further refined, and management mechanisms are\nestablished.\nDuring the inception phase, the work plan will be revised, and therefore, output indicators and targets may be\nmodified. The results from the inception phase will also be used to adjust the logical framework, enhancing\neffectiveness, and aligning with stakeholder needs. The operational budget will be developed and modified\naccordingly. A separate M&E plan will be finalized in collaboration between all involved agencies and the European\nUnion.\nQuantitative and qualitative analyses, and implementation of activities to be implemented will take place during the\ninception phase, as specified in the Work Plan (Annex II). This will include a joint baseline study. Any additional\npartner institutions relevant for activity implementation under the project will be further identified.\nPriorities during this period will include establishing project management and governance mechanisms and building\na consensus with key stakeholders on work plan activities.\n\n83\nAccordingly, the main objectives of the inception phase are to:\n- Build consensus among all relevant parties on project activities to finetune the work plan.\n- Enhance the logical framework in line with identified stakeholders’ needs and project goals.\n- Establish a robust project management and governance mechanism.\nUpon conclusion of the inception phase, the project will be formally amended to reflect the above.\n6.2 IMPLEMENTATION MODALITIES\nThroughout the project's duration, a range of strategic approaches will be employed to effectively attain the\nproject's objectives. These approaches have been carefully selected based on the partner agency's expertise, insights\ngarnered from prior experiences with similar projects, and a deep understanding of operating within the Iraqi\ncontext. Over the course of the project, various forms of expertise will be harnessed, including the contributions of\nagency staff and the engagement of national and international experts through subcontracting for specialized\nactivities.\nAdditionally, the project will establish technical working groups, engage stakeholders through policy dialogues, and\nconduct consultations involving public, private, and civil society advisors. Furthermore, the project will tap into the\nknowledge and expertise of steering committee members and government counterparts to facilitate the\nachievement of project objectives. A summary of these modalities is provided below (further elaborated in the\nResults Chain section):\nExpert Guidance: Engaging with individuals or organization with specialized expertise that pertains to the project\nobjectives, including, for example: affordable housing policy, finance or program design experts, workers or\nemployers representative groups and other CSOs, subject expert colleagues from headquarters offices. Expert\nknowledge will be tapped into for insight, best practices, and to support in the development and weighing of possible\nsolutions to produce expected outcomes.\nCapacity Building: Building the capacity of the GOI including government officials, local authorities and project staff\nwill include trainings and workshops on multiple topical subjects related to affordable housing policy, construction,\nbusiness development.\nPolicy Development: Technical assistance provided by UN-Habitat will support the GOI in the refinement housing\npolicies through updating the National Housing Policy and revisions of the legislative and regulatory framework. The\ntechnical assistance will involve support to the GOI in analyzing existing policies, identifying gaps, and proposing\nreforms to align with international best practices and the specific needs of low-income and vulnerable populations.\nPolicy Dialogue: The project will actively engage in policy dialogue by facilitating structured and inclusive discussions\namong government officials, CSO’s, subject experts and other relevant stakeholders. These discussions will serve as\na platform for sharing expertise and insight, addressing collective challenges, and shaping housing and labour policies\nand programs. Policy dialogue will promote consensus-building and the development of effective, evidence-based\npolicies that align with the project's collective objectives.\nTechnical Assistance & Knowledge Transfer: Partner organizations (staff and consultants) will provide hand-on\nassistance and expertise to support knowledge building, skills development, and transfer. This approach aims to\nfoster building the technical competency of the various stakeholder groups, enabling them to eventually tackle\ncomplex challenges autonomously.\nPeer-to-Peer Exchange: a knowledge exchange network will be established as part of the capacity building output\nwhich will facilitate continued dialogue among peer networks of housing professionals.\n\n84\nProblem-solving: The project partners will provide a pool of experts to support the GOI in trouble shooting issues,\nproposing sustainable solutions, and supporting in execution of strategies - that are in alignment with this project’s\nobjectives and goals.\nAwareness Raising: The project will include establishing two neighborhood Centres for Green Technology which will\norganize workshops, seminars, and training sessions to disseminate information on sustainable housing practices\nand raise environmental awareness at the neighborhood level.\nPilot Projects: The construction of 200 green social housing units will serve as a tangible demonstration that in Iraq,\nthe effective utilization of available resources can result in sustainable, cost effective and scalable social housing,\nwhile also foster job creation and supporting economic growth.\n6.3 RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe logical framework and activities matrix provide an overview of the main assumptions made during the design\nphase. This will have to be reviewed and updated during the inception phase. A more detailed risk register will be\nprepared and managed throughout the project. This will include the identification of mitigation measures. The\nnature of this project will not only require some stability in the economic, political, and safety and security context,\nbut also buy-in and proactive support from government, private sector and civil society stakeholders. The\ngovernance mechanism will also ensure that technical assistance will be mobilized when the necessary preconditions\nare in place.\nCategory Risk Likeliho\nod\n(H/M/L)\nImpact\n(H/M/L)\nMitigating

MANDATES\n\n87\n6.4.1 UNITED NATIONS HUMAN SETTLEMENTS PROGRAMME (UN-HABITAT)\nUN-Habitat is mandated in 1978 by the United Nations General Assembly to promote socially and environmentally\nsustainable towns and cities with the goal of providing adequate shelter for all. It is a knowledgeable institution on\nurban development processes and understands the aspirations of cities and their residents. For over forty years, UN-\nHabitat has been working in human settlements throughout the world, focusing on building a brighter future for\nvillages, towns, and cities of all sizes. Because of these decades of extensive experience, from the highest levels of\npolicy to a range of specific technical issues, UN-Habitat has gained a unique and a universally acknowledged\nexpertise in all things urban.\nUN-Habitat has developed a holistic and global approach towards urbanization that embraces much more than just\ntechnical considerations. Beyond its traditional core areas — such as city planning, infrastructure development, and\nparticipatory slum upgrading — UN-Habitat, today, also focuses on urban legislation and risk management, as well\nas gender, youth and capacity building for all actors involved in the urbanization process. UN-Habitat works in over\n90 countries to promote transformative change in cities and human settlements through knowledge, policy advice,\ntechnical assistance, and collaborative action.\nUN-Habitat boasts vast experience in delivering technical assistance and capacity building related to housing. The\norganization has developed an comprehensive repository of housing resources and toolkits such as SHERPA and\nmore recently the Housing Value Assessment Methodology (VAM) tool. VAM is currently assisting governments\nincluding Burkina Faso, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Senegal and Ghana in conducting rapid assessments of large housing\nprojects and national housing programmes. In total, 43 countries have formulated and implemented improved\nhousing policies based on technical guidance from UN-Habitat. Furthermore, UN-Habitat possesses broad\ninternational experience in endeavours such as slum upgrading, housing construction and renovation. Recent\nprojects in the MENA region including Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon highlight the organization’s\ncommitment to housing as a human right. Moreover, UN-Habitat engages in the Sustainable Buildings and\nConstruction Programme (SBC) which aims to promote resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation efforts, and\nthe shift to sustainable consumption and production (SCP) patterns within the building and construction sector. This\nis achieved through the enhancement of knowledge regarding sustainable construction, the development of\nsustainable solutions, and global dissemination of this knowledge and these solutions.\nFollowing are some instances of UN-Habitat’s support provided to other countries:\n1. In “The Effective Implementation of Developmental Housing” UN-Habitat offered technical support to the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia helping to build a robust policy and institutional framework for delivering 300k\nsocial housing units to Saudi’s most vulnerable and low-income citizens.\n2. In Lebanon, after the 2020 explosion, UN-Habitat has been actively involved in supporting the\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of housing as well as the rebuilding of public spaces in the most vulnerable\nareas impacted by the disaster.\n3. In Sri Lanka, UN-Habitat's technical support has led to the preparation of the National Assessment of\nSustainable Building Construction and the Sustainable Housing and Construction Roadmap 2020 – 2050.\nThese initiatives provides guidance to policymakers, regulatory and enforcement authorities, researchers,\ndesigners, contractors and builders to transitions the construction industry towards resource efficient and\nsustainable practices, aligning with the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC as a\nsignatory to the Paris Agreement.\n4. In Egypt, UN-Habitat supported the government to develop a comprehensive housing profile that served as\nthe foundation country’s National Housing Strategy, also supported by UN-Habitat. The strategy represents\na unified, integrated vision for the housing sector over a twenty-year horizon. It clarifies the responsibilities\nof different sectors and policy frameworks while emphasizing the government’s role in regulation and\nempowerment.\n\n88\n5. In Darfur, UN-Habitat has assisted internally displaced persons (IDPs) in developing sustainable construction\nskills through a \"Darfur Early Recovery, Stabilized Soils Blocks for Sustainable Growth\" project. This program\nutilized a \"training of trainers\" approach and reached over 1,800 individuals, providing them with training\nand practical experience in constructing buildings using locally produced soil blocks. These efforts extended\nto major cities, towns, and villages in Darfur.\nUN-Habitat in Iraq\nUN-Habitat has been active in Iraq since 1996 under the Oil for Food Programme. After 2003, UN-Habitat was largely\nengaged in early recovery efforts, particularly those supporting internally displaced persons through the provision\nof shelter and reconstruction solutions.\nEarly UN-Habitat activities in Iraq included the implementation of the Settlements Rehabilitation Programme setup\nto assist IDPs and other vulnerable groups in Iraq and overseeing the Housing Sector Observation Programme in\nCentral and Southern Iraq and the implementation of the Neighbourhoods Rehabilitation Project in Baghdad. After\n2003, UN-Habitat was largely engaged in early recovery efforts, supporting new waves of IDPs through the provision\nof shelter and reconstruction initiatives, including advising on national urban planning and housing policy. In 2014,\nthe portfolio of UN-Habitat Iraq expanded to include both humanitarian and development programmes providing\nIDPs, Syrian refugees and host communities with dignified shelter and an improved living environment.\nSince 2015, UN-Habitat has supported recovery efforts in war-affected areas by building new core houses in-situ;\nrehabilitating damaged houses, infrastructure, marketplaces, and water and sanitation facilities; upgrading basic\ninfrastructure; rehabilitating green public spaces; improving living conditions of IDPs and returnees; protecting HLP\nrights and securing tenure rights for vulnerable communities; providing vocational training; and creating jobs for\nIDPs and returnees.\nIn the past four years, the agency has refocused its attention towards community-based reconstruction,\nrehabilitation of housing and basic services in urban settlements affected by the conflict, participatory design and\ncreation of public open spaces, construction of low-cost housing units to support the return of vulnerable IDPs to\ntheir areas of origin, delivery of vocational training, and implementation of informal settlement upgrading projects,\nwhile continuing to provide technical assistance to local and national authorities in urban policy-making and city\nplanning, urban heritage conservation, advocacy, data analysis, GIS mapping, climate change adaptation, and the\nprotection of Housing, Land, and Property (HLP) rights of minorities and vulnerable groups.\n6.4.2 INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION (ILO)\nThe mandate and vision of the International Labour Organization (ILO) is to promote decent work for all workers,\nregardless of where they work. For millions of workers and employers, especially for young people in the informal\neconomy worldwide, decent work remains an elusive goal.\nIraq has been a member of the ILO since 1932 and has ratified 68 ILO conventions, including all eight fundamental\nconventions. Since 2004, the ILO and Iraq’s government, workers’ organizations and employers’ organizations have\nworked closely as part of the post-war reconstruction effort to bolster decent work and develop the labour market\nacross the different areas of the country. In 2019, the Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) for 2019-2023 was\nadopted by the ILO, Government, and social partners, representing a shared commitment to promote decent work\nin Iraq. The DWCP outlines three guiding priorities, namely supporting private sector development and job creation,\nstrengthening social protection and addressing child labour, and strengthening labour governance and social\ndialogue.\nThe ILO has over 100 years of experience providing technical assistance to Governments in designing, reforming and\nimplementing public employment programmes across the world, starting from the responses to the economic\ndepressions in the 1920s and 1930s all the way to interventions implemented to limit the socio-economic effects of\n\n89\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and beyond (ILO, 2021)10. Over the course of that century, the ILO has expanded and\nspecialized its service offer, ensuring the technical assistance provided contributes to the development and\nimplementation of inclusive programmes that promote sustainable impacts, meet the most pressing challenges of\nthe time and context, and achieve decent opportunities for participants.\nThe ILO has provided direct technical assistance to governments to establish programmes across the world with\ntailored and highly technical expertise. For example, in South Africa the ILO contributed to the Expanded Public\nWorks Programme through – among others - the development of technical and managerial capacities, and the\ndevelopment and adoption of the Code of Good Practice for Employment and Conditions of Work in Special Public\nWorks Programmes which ensures that employment under the programme is decent. In India, the ILO contributed\nto the development of methodologies for participatory planning and selection of employment intensive\nenvironmental works under the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme and supported the development of\nguidelines for State-level implementation of that programme’s successor, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural\nEmployment Guarantee Act (MNREGA). This is the largest programme of its nature in the world, providing\nemployment to an average of 55 million workers each year on the basis of a legislated commitment to the right to\nwork. In Greece, the Kinofelis programme implements a wide variety of projects that take into consideration the\nexisting educational level and skills of the participants to best harness and build on participants’ strengths. Here, the\nILO supported in revising and developing implementation guidance notes; provided training and capacity building\ninterventions for executing institutions; designed systems and processes for programme implementation and quality\nassurance; and designed a reporting and monitoring system, among others.\nIn addition to these specific experiences, the ILO has also developed a wide range of recommendations, toolkits and\nguidance documents at the global level made available to all decision-makers and practitioners to support in the\ndesign, implementation and monitoring of programmes.\nWhile it is difficult to summarize the lessons from the numerous programmes supported over this period, below are\noutlined some of the overarching lessons learned in supporting the design and implementation of effective and\nsustainable programmes of relevance to the context of Iraq.\n• Evidence-based programming: The ILO has elaborated a range of tools that can support decision-makers to\ngenerate the necessary evidence not only to inform the effective design of programmes, but also to monitor\nprogramme performance and impacts.\n• Inclusive decision-making at all levels for inclusive and sustainable outcomes: The ILO has longstanding\nexperience streamlining inclusivity and participatory approaches in the programmes to which it provides\nsupport, including in India, Liberia, and elsewhere. The ILO’s tripartite structure represents an important\nfoundation towards these efforts.\n• Streamlining decent work principles: Decent work opportunities under PWP ensure these contribute to\nsustainable outcomes and ensures they effectively reduce poverty and vulnerability. As in the case of South\nAfrica outlined above, the ILO has longstanding experience in advocating and providing technical inputs to\ngovernments to improve the quality of the employment opportunities implemented under PWPs, including\nin the integration of training opportunities that contribute to professional development.\n• Capacity strengthening for sustainable outcomes: The ILO streamlines capacity strengthening activities in\nthe majority of its technical assistance to PWPs, to ensure the sustainability of the programmes and their\neffective implementation. Here, the ILO utilizes a range of approaches, building on its vast range of toolkits\nand guidance documents, it’s strong partnership with the ITC-ILO, and its longstanding international\nengagement in this field which enables facilitation of peer-to-peer learning, including through study tours\nand site demonstrations, for example.\n10 ILO (2021), 100 Years of Public Works in the ILO, available here\n\n90\n• Private-sector partnerships: Engaging the private sector as sub-contractors or suppliers contributes to\nmaximizing the impacts of the programme, contributing not only to indirect job creation and growth. The\nILO has increasingly been streamlining private-sector contractor development in its activities in this field,\nincluding in Ethiopia for example.\n6.4.3 INTERNATIONAL TRADE CENTRE (ITC)\nEstablished in 1964, the International Trade Centre is the joint agency of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and\nthe United Nations (UN). ITC is the only international development agency fully dedicated to supporting micro, small\nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to enable them to benefit from trade. Working with partners to strengthen\nMSME competitiveness, ITC helps to build entrepreneurial and employment opportunities, particularly for women,\nyouth and people in vulnerable situations. ITC’s main clients are MSMEs, business support organizations (BSOs) and\ngovernments in developing countries and economies in transition.\nITC’s mandate combines a focus on expanding trade opportunities for MSMEs with the aim of achieving sustainable\ndevelopment. ITC’s value proposition pools a unique set of technical and operational capacities to respond to client\nneeds. ITC will build on its long-standing expertise in data collection and management to provide tools that support\ninformed and evidence-based business decisions, policymaking and advocacy.\nConnecting MSMEs to value chains and helping them succeed in global trade is central to ITC’s mission. ITC addresses\nthe managerial, strategic and operational needs of MSMEs and helps create market linkages. ITC’s approach to\nassessing and building firm-level capacities is harmonized, yet modular to address particular situations. In support\nof increased competitiveness and resilience in value chains, ITC mobilizes policymakers, BSOs and the private sector\nto build commercial alliances. At the enterprise level, ITC reinforces supply and production in view of market\nopportunities, strengthening managerial practices and driving innovation. ITC supports MSMEs in their sourcing,\nmarketing and market linkage activities.\nIn response to rising demand for sustainable production and trade, ITC helps MSMEs understand and adhere to\nsocial and environmental sustainability standards along value chains and in benefit from related market\nopportunities, production upgrades and efficiencies. ITC also seek to influence how value is created and distributed,\nhelping MSMEs in developing countries capture higher value goods and services.\nIn the area of strategy development, ITC holds 20 years of experience, delivering over 100 strategies to more than\n70 countries in more than 50 sectors. Strategies are designed to reduce trade barriers, identify growth opportunities,\nand chart blueprints for action. An ITC-facilitated strategy sets priorities, allocates resources, and specifies how to\nbecome more competitive. Based on decades of experience, ITC assists with implementing those strategies and\nmobilizing international donor resources. Technical assistance is built into every step, to ensure that partner\ncountries gain the experience to create their own trade development strategies. ITC trade strategies place special\nemphasis on opportunities for women, young people, low-skilled workers and remote communities.\nIn the area of trade and investment policy support, ITC provides tailored support to business, trade support\ninstitutions and policy makers, such as advisory services, technical studies and analyses, public and private sector\ncapacity building and facilitation of public-private dialogues. Further, ITC has vast experience assisting developing\nand least developed countries in their bid for WTO membership and post-accession implementation of\ncommitments. Specific initiatives were implemented in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Sudan, and Iraq.\nAdditionally, ITC has been engaged in implementing the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement in over 65 countries.\nSpecific sector-level experience includes for example ITC’s technical support under the Sri Lanka Trade-Related\nAssistance Project, funded by the European Union, implemented in collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka.\nThe project aims to strengthen institutional capacities to develop and coordinate the design and implementation of\ncoherent domestic regulatory reforms, trade policies and trade negotiations through public-private dialogues\n(PPDs). Under this framework, ITC commissioned a regulatory assessment of services trade and investment (RASTI)\non the priority sector of Architectural and engineering services, and construction services. The regulatory\nassessment embedded – inter alia - a mapping and analysis of relevant laws, including investment laws, identifying\ntrade restrictions within the legislation and relevant measures, followed by a governance review, alongside\n\n91\nconsultation with sector stakeholders, assessment of the impact of regulations on market structure, prices and\naccess and consideration of regulatory alternatives.\nITC in Iraq\nSince 2020, ITC has been a resident agency in Iraq. ITC is active with local staff and partners operational in Baghdad,\nErbil, Mosul and Basrah. In Iraq, ITC implements programs to support essential reforms and market-based solutions\nfor inclusive and sustainable economic development and job creation, focusing on the integration of MSMEs into\ndomestic and international value chains. ITC’s work in Iraq is aligned with and directly contributes to national\ndevelopment priorities. The policy direction outlined in the recent Iraqi government program (November 2022), is\nrelevant to ITC, particularly under the following priorities “reforming the economic and financial sectors, especially\nagriculture, industry, and banking sectors and supporting the private sector” and “addressing unemployment and\ncreating work opportunities for youth of both genders”.\nITC is implementing an innovative methodology to link Iraqi MSMEs with an unprecedented network of buyers,\ngathering prominent business across the country. ITC provides tailored support to improve firms’ capacities, upgrade\ntheir business models to seize remunerative market opportunities and establish long-term meaningful connections\nwith buyers.\nIn strategy design, ITC has successfully facilitated two sector-level strategies endorsed by the Government of Iraq\nand under implementation. While in the area of trade policy, ITC provided technical and advisory support to the\nGovernment of Iraq on WTO accession, leading to a revision of Iraq’s tariff structure in collaboration with customs\nand the revision and submission of Iraq’s services offer to the WTO by the Ministry of Trade.\n6.5 PROJECT GOVERNANCE\nA Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be established with responsibility for guiding the project and for approving\nannual work plans. Its members will be comprised of Government representatives concerned by the project (e.g.,\nMoP, MoCHMPW, MoLSA, MoT) and co-chaired by the Ministry of Planning and the EU representative. Additional\nPSC members will be identified during the inception phase and who might include private sector, CSOs, or academic\nrepresentatives. The PSC primary roles will include:\n- Provides guidance in the overall direction of the project based on established goals and objectives.\n- Ensures alignment of the project with other major initiatives in Iraq.\n- Reviews and endorses annual workplans.\n- Review the performance of the project against the work plans and the project logical framework, and make\nrecommendations for adjustments as relevant.\n- Assess areas of actual and potential risk and provide advice on suitable mitigation measures and gather\nlessons learned.\n- Supports in project outreach and advocacy, information gathering and dissemination, and connecting\nproject staff to stakeholder groups and technical experts.\n- Facilitate access to management decisions for the adoption of recommended reforms identified in various\naspects of the project.\n- Facilitate the overall function of the project management team for effective implementation.\n- Support in increasing the project’s visibility within and among government agencies, various stakeholder\ngroups and the public.\n- Ensures that the Action maintains coherence with the national development, housing, labour and trade\npriorities of Iraq.\nThe members of the PSC will meet at a minimum once a year and UN-Habitat will ensure the functioning of the\nSecretariat of the PSC as well as provide a review of the achieved results of the past year and provide a forecast of\nthe planned activities for the following 12 months. A process for information sharing and collaboration for instance,\nmonitoring and information sharing meetings, will be devised. It will also gather lessons learned, identify possible\nbottlenecks and risks and propose mitigation actions. Development partners, implementing programmes with which\n\n92\nsynergies have been identified, will be granted observer status in order to maximise cross-fertilisation and\nopportunities for collaboration. Additionally, technical working groups for various project components - comprised\nof steering committee representatives and other technical experts- having a more specific and practical approach in\naddressing the possible challenges and opportunities encountered by the project will convene as needed. Quarterly\nupdates/highlights will also be circulated among steering committee members and technical working groups.\n6.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION FRAMEWORK\nJoint Project Management and Coordination\nThe Project Management Team plays a key role in ensuring the success of the project, by overseeing day to day\nactivities, managing, and tracking of budget and resources, handling administrative oversight including monitoring\nand compliance and managing the relationship with partners in Iraq and with the EU.

PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND REPORTING\nProject progress and outputs will be monitored using the measurable baseline and target indicators set in the logical\nframework. Indicators at the output level are directly linked to activities outlined in the results chain. Indicators and\ntargets will be refined during and after the inception phase. The inception phase report will summarize activities,\n\n103\nresults, and lessons learned, allowing for recommended revisions to better align the project’s targets with country\nneeds.\nA joint baseline study will be conducted during the inception phase capturing a comprehensive overview of the\nprevailing conditions, challenges, and prospects in the target areas. By methodically gathering and analysing crucial\ndata, the three agencies will acquire an in-depth understanding of baseline indicators, socio-economic dynamics,\nand prevalent gaps. This insights-driven approach will empower the project to systematically track and assess its\nadvancement and outcomes over time, while concurrently shaping customized approaches that effectively address\nspecific community needs. This foundational study will establish a benchmark against which the project's progress\ncan be gauged, ensuring a focused and impactful trajectory for the project.\nA joint M&E plan will be shared as a deliverable at the end of the inception phase, which will outline data collection\nstrategies, tools, and reporting mechanisms that align closely with our project's objectives.\nFollowing the inception phase, monitoring will continue on an ongoing basis. Regular data collection and analysis\nwill play a pivotal role, enabling us to continually gauge our progress, fine-tune strategies, and make informed\ndecisions. Annual project progress reports, financial reports and work plans will be submitted to the steering\ncommittee for review and approval. These reports will track implementation progress, note difficulties, changes,\nand measure achievement of results using the logical framework. Additional project updates or reporting\nobligations, as stipulated by the EU or the respective agency headquarters will be determined during the inception\nphase, and appropriate templates will be developed accordingly.\nA mid-term external evaluation will provide an impartial assessment, guiding us towards mid-course corrections if\nneeded. Finally, as we approach the project's conclusion, a comprehensive final external evaluation will provide\ninsights into the project's overall outcomes and impact.\nA final evaluation will be conducted by independent consultants for learning, accountability, and policy revision\npurposes. Evaluation reports will be shared with the government partners and other key stakeholders.\n8. COMMUNICATIONS AND VISIBILITY\nCommunication and visibility of the EU is a legal obligation for all external Actions funded by the EU.\nThe action will undertake a variety of activities to ensure visibility and promote the lessons learned and\nachievements made. A communication and visibility plan will be developed during the Inception Phase, in full\nconsultation with the EU Delegation in Iraq and in adherence to EU communication requirements to ensure visibility\nand enable the effective dissemination of achievements and lessons learned to the different groups of partners and\ndecision makers. During the inception phase, the joint Advocacy and Outreach Officer will be tasked with devising a\ncommunication and visibility plan, for the overarching project for the full duration and will support plan\nimplementation, advocacy and outreach activities, and coordination among project partners.\nCommunication will occur throughout the programme cycle. The Action will use several channels for knowledge\nsharing and communication. Communication and visibility activities will be tailored appropriately to target groups\nand sequenced to achieve maximum impact. They will inform target audiences about the reasons for the Action, the\nsupport provided by the EU and multilateral partners, and the outcomes and impact of that support.\nCommunication measures will ensure wide and timely information and publicity and seek to maximise synergies\nwith the relevant general EU communication strategy. All the communication materials used in the project will be\napproved by the European Union before publication or public presentation.\n9. ALIGNMENT WITH DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES\n\n104\n9.1 NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES\nThe objectives of this proposed joint programme are closely aligned with recent and established development plans\nand policies from the government of Iraq, which have emphasized the need for the creation of more good quality\njobs; increased supply of housing, and of affordable housing in particular; enhanced sustainability; improved\ninfrastructure and alternatives to informal settlements; and the development of MSMEs and the private sector more\ngenerally. These plans emphasize the potential of regulatory reform, public investment, improved urban planning\nand investment facilitation as means of achieving these goals, which will inform how the project identifies areas of\npotential cooperation with the government. In this respect the proposed activities of this joint project are in close\nalignment with the following national plans and priorities:\nIraq’s Vision for Sustainable Development 2030: Published in 2019, the Vision is based on the sustainable\ndevelopment dimensions which meet Iraq’s aspirations for empowered Iraqis in a safe and unified country, a society\nin which all have equal rights, an economic system with diversified social market orientation and stable\nmacroeconomic indexes and creating a clean, safe and sustainable environment for the current and future\ngenerations. The aim is to achieve a sustainable improvement in the quality of people’s lives, ensure the\nsustainability of the production and consumption patterns, reduce the repercussions of pollution and climate change\nand enhance biodiversity protection through governmental institutions which guarantee the respect of political, civil\nand human rights of people to meet the desired results and achieve equality for all citizens (Ministry of Planning,\n2019). The proposed joint project aligns with multiple goals of the vision, in particular: (1.2) Create decent jobs\nopportunities for all Iraqis, (1.5) Provide decent housing and end informal settlements, (3.3) Strong private sector\nwhich contributes to the development ending informal settlements, and (5.1) Reduce environment pollution and\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nIraq National Development Plan (2018-2022): aims to strengthen the role of the private sector and to create\nappropriate opportunities to play its real role in the development process, especially in light of the decline of the\nrole of the state and the suspension of many government projects due to the financial crisis and the low size of\navailable financial revenues. The Development Plan aims to increase the private sector's contribution to investment\nto 61.7 percent in 2022, compared to 38.3 percent in 2016. The plan also addresses the lack of urban planning, and\nthe need to increase the housing supply. The proposed activities of this joint programme aims to support key pillars\nof the NDP, such as: reducing unemployment, utilizing the demographic window, increasing the contribution of the\nprivate sector, promoting effective participation of the private sector in reconstruction and development, ensuring\neffective public participation in decision making, providing adequate housing and responsive environment, and\naddressing climate change and its effects, among many others.\nIraq Ministerial Programme (2022): In October 2022, following the new government’s entry into office, the Prime\nMinister Office put in place a new government Programme. The Programme is focused in addressing unemployment\nissues; creating work opportunities for young women and men; and reforming the economic and financial sectors,\nespecially agriculture, industry, and banking sectors and supporting the private sector. The Programme has 23\ndifferent spheres including: combating unemployment and creating job opportunities; investment; social protection\nand fighting poverty; human rights and women empowerment; and legislation and policy reform. The Programme\nalso highlights on how to unleash the potential in the investment environment and expand its horizons through\nreforming and streamlining the procedures in force in the investment departments and support investors for the\npurpose of developing all sectors covered by the investment law to create job opportunities for the Iraqi workforce.\nIn the effort to address high rates of unemployment, the new government in office is also planning to provide\nsupport for public and private sectors as well as encourage the establishment of small and medium enterprises,\nprovide soft loans, follow up on their implementation and completion stages, and provide advice and expertise to\nensure their success and operation.\nFurthermore, the ministerial program – under the “combating unemployment and creating job opportunities”\nsphere – aims to immediately start distributing 500,000 housing units to beneficiaries as a first stage in the new cities\nin all governorates, providing soft loans to citizens to build these housing units, and setting up a transparent\nmechanism for the participation of the private sector in constructing these cities with full services.\n\n105\nIraq National Poverty Reduction Strategy (2018-2022): The Poverty Reduction Strategy is a 5-year nationwide\nsectoral document in line with the goals of the National Development Plan (NDP) for 2018-2022. The Main goal is\nreducing poverty by at least 25 percent, by 2022. The strategic plan envisages improving standards of living,\nprotection against risks and hazards, achievement of economic empowerment needed to turn the poor into\nproductive individuals economically and socially integrated. These objectives are to be achieved through sustainable\nincome from work, improved health status, improved education, suitable housing and environment responsive to\nchallenges, effective social protection, and emergency response activities.\nIraq Housing National Housing Policy (2010 & 2017): Developed with the support of UN-Habitat, the Ministry of\nConstruction and Housing lays-out a roadmap to scale up housing provision by establishing an enabling environment,\nparticularly through private sector engagement. The National Housing Policy sets broad parameters for housing\nsector development and stresses the need to meet demand and enable economic growth. The Policy was modified\nin 2017 to better reflect the current conditions in Iraq and prioritises specific actions for implementation.\nPrivate Sector Development Strategy (2014-2030): Published in 2015 prior to the fiscal crisis and the ISIS conflict,\nthe strategy identifies key reforms legal and regulatory reforms needed to entice more domestic and foreign private\nsector investment. The strategy was developed collaboratively with the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) and adopted by the Council of Ministers. The strategy aims to stimulate growth and create jobs through\ndiversifying economy through bolstering the private sector and promoting development (BTI, 2022).\nReconstruction and Development Framework: Launched by the government in 2018, the Framework aimed to\nrespond to the current needs and recovery resulting from the armed conflict.\n11 \nThe key actions in the framework\nare governance, national reconciliation and peacebuilding, social and human development, infrastructure and\neconomic development. These five pillars are prioritized and aim to contribute to the adoption of an integrated\nreconstruction and development plan for the country, in application until 2027. This framework aims to create new\npossibilities for the population by enabling economic recovery, the cost of which is claimed to be nearly US$88\nbillion.\nUnder Pillar 4 of the Plan, rehabilitation of infrastructure can be managed through employment / income generation\nunder public works and cash for work. Specific sectors for this include removal of explosive hazards, rebuilding of\ndestroyed or damaged infrastructure and facilities, as well as ensuring provision of basic services such as water and\nsanitation. As recommended by the Framework, public works and cash transfer remains a priority intervention but\nshould also bear in mind the long-term need for regulatory changes that facilitate employment creation.\nAn emphasis on low-income housing strategies is also included within the plan’s goals, through recommending a 10-\nyear affordable housing programme for vulnerable groups, a 15-year urban upgrading programme and\ninstitutionalizing a transparent land management system.\n9.2 ALIGNMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION’S (EU’S) POLICY PRIORITIES\nThe climate initiatives in the proposed project will align with the EU Green Deal policies aiming to support meeting\n2030 climate targets, in particular: transforming our economy and societies, cleaning our energy system, and\nboosting climate action. The project is also further guided by EU’s Sustainable Growth and Jobs policy areas:\nbusiness environment and investment climate, economic integration, trade and connectivity, employment and\ndecent work, and private sector and sustainable industries. The project has also been designed to support the\nEuropean Consensus on Development in its efforts to eradicate poverty through the integration of economic, social\nand environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Further the project aligns with the EU International\nPartnerships (INTPA) policy areas: climate, environment and energy, gender equality, migration and forced\ndisplacement, and sustainable growth and jobs. The project also supports the EU’s Global Gateway strategic priority,\n‘building an economy that works’ and policy and initiative areas, in particular: education and training, climate action,\nbusiness and industry, and employment and social affairs.\n11 \nGovernment of Iraq (2018), Iraq Reconstruction and Investment, available here.\n\n106\nAt the country level, project has been designed based on the European Union’s (EU’s) Action Document for Support\nto Durable Solutions for Iraq’s Displaced Populations: Integration into the National Labour Market and National\nSystems for Education and Social Protection, the proposed programme would support the first objective of the\nMulti-Annual Indicative Programme (MIP) for Iraq, as stated in the Action Document, which calls for action to\n“promote an economic transformation that creates decent jobs and increases productive capacity”. The project also\nseeks to fully integrate cross cutting themes into its activities and will reflect a people-centered human rights-based\napproach. In this respect, the activities of the project will align with the strategic objectives outline in the EU Gender\nAction Plan III Country Level Implementation Plan for Iraq (GAP III CLIP) (2021-2025) and through supporting the\nEU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, and all other human rights covenants and international\nconventions. The project will also support the priorities of the Civil Society Roadmap (2021-2025) through facilitating\nand engaging in policy dialogue with relevant organization such as CBOs, NGOs, research centres, trade organizations\nto support key project activities such as policy formulation, regulatory and legislative reviews, neighbourhood\nplanning and climate outreach activities. Together, the funding decision of the EU to support this joint programme\nwill help to advance the European Union’s comprehensive set of policies and priorities and aims to facilitate the\nachievement of Iraq’s long-term development objectives of building a more sustainable, economically prosperous,\nand resilient future.\n9.3 ALIGNMENT WITH UNITED NATIONS PRIORITIES\nThis project aspires to contribute to two of the five strategic priorities of the United Nations Sustainable\nDevelopment Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) Iraq (2020-2024) – Strategic Priority 2: Growing the economy for\nall and Strategic Priority 5: Achieving dignified, safe and voluntary durable solutions to displacement in Iraq.\nBy ‘delivering as one’ this joint project will combine the expertise of three UN agencies through a multi-dimensional\napproach that promotes intersectoral dialogue to support Iraq’s progress towards the Sustainable Development\nGoals, and its pledge to leave no one behind, including targets under SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 6 (clean water\nand sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (industry,\ninnovation and infrastructure), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12\n(responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13 (climate action). Further, the project will seek to support\nIraq in achieving its declared climate goals to reduce carbon emissions and pursue renewable energy solutions set\nforth in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as part of the country’s recent ratification of the Paris\nAgreement in 2020.\nThrough its emphasis on the creation of quality jobs and inclusive opportunities, the project supports the\nimplementation of the Iraq Decent Work Country Programme (2019-2023) (DWCP). The Programme sets out the\ncommon commitment of the government, workers’ and employers’ organizations and the ILO to promote Decent\nWork. It prioritises the creation of new jobs by the private sector, the extension and strengthening of social\nprotection and an effective framework to address child labour, and the strengthening of the labour market to\npromote the realisation of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work through improved social dialogue\nmechanisms. Furthermore, the project is expected to contribute to the ILO Programme and Budget for the biennium\n2022-2023 policy outcomes. These include Outcome 1: Strong tripartite constituents and influential and inclusive\nsocial dialogue; Outcome 4: Sustainable enterprises as generators of employment and promoters of innovation and\ndecent work; Outcome 6: Gender equality and equal opportunities and treatment in the world of work; and Outcome\n7: Adequate and effective protection at work for all.\n10.
