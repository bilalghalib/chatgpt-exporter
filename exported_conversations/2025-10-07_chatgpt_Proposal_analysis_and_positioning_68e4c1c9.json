      "content": "Got it — let’s zoom out first.  \n\n### 📌 Analysis of Your Position  \nBased on your history and the TOR:  \n\n1. **Credibility** – You already delivered successfully on a *similar contract with 51 Labs* (climate resilience integration). That gives you leverage: you’re a *trusted provider* who knows their workflows, curriculum style, and expectations. You’re not coming in cold.  \n\n2. **Strengths**  \n   - Deep **curriculum design** and **entrepreneurship training** background (Bloom, 400+ entrepreneurs, 350+ mentors trained).  \n   - **Experience contextualizing** global tools (BMC, prototyping, pitching) to fragile / crisis-affected settings (Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine).  \n   - **Systems perspective** (food, climate, economics) — you don’t just add slides, you build frameworks and impact indicators.  \n   - **Creative, practical methodology** — you emphasize not replacing existing systems but weaving in resilience, belonging, and community agency. This maps well to *food redistribution models and community-driven solutions*.  \n\n3. **Positioning Angle**  \n   - You’re not “just” an adapter. You’re a **bridge**: between research → curriculum → trainer capacity → measurable community impact.  \n   - Your edge is in **local sensitivity + global frameworks**. You can bring in case studies from MENA (e.g. informal food markets, Lebanon community fridges) alongside international best practice.  \n   - You can frame yourself as someone who **helps entrepreneurs see food waste not only as a problem but as a business opportunity**, connecting social impact to viable ventures.  \n\n4. **Risks to Address**  \n   - They’re asking for *food waste/food security familiarity*. You haven’t branded yourself as a “food systems expert” before — but you *can frame* your climate/sustainability work as adjacent. And your experience with value chains, social enterprises, and resilience easily transfers.  \n   - They want “impact framework with indicators.” You should emphasize your past **research (Beirut Blast thesis, PTG data analysis)** and how you can design practical measurement tools (food saved, households reached, etc.).  \n\n5. **Tone for Pitch**  \n   - Practical, evidence-based, but also creative.  \n   - “I’ve already done this with your climate curriculum. Now I can apply the same tested process to food waste/security.”  \n   - Stress co-creation, humility, and adaptability: “not just importing models, but working with your team to localize them.”  \n\n---\n\n### 📌 Five Questions for You  \nBefore drafting your adapted proposal, I need clarity on these:  \n\n1. **Case Studies** – Do you already have in mind local or regional food waste/food security examples you’d like to highlight (e.g. Lebanon, Iraq, MENA region), or should I source and contextualize global ones?  \n\n2. **Impact Framework** – How sophisticated should the measurement be? (simple indicators like *kg of food saved per entrepreneur* vs. more complex ones like *household nutrition outcomes, revenue changes*).  \n\n3. **Trainer Capacity-Building** – Do you want to propose just one ToT session (as TOR requires), or do you want to add optional follow-up mentoring/coaching of trainers?  \n\n4. **Translation & Language** – In your last proposal, you budgeted for Kurdish/Arabic translation. Do you want to include that here again, or should we keep materials in English and leave translation to them?  \n\n5. **Budget & Positioning** – Last time you proposed 4M IQD (~$3K). Do you want to stay in that ballpark, increase (since scope is bigger: impact framework + ToT), or price more competitively to secure repeat work?  \n\n---\n\n👉 Want me to then draft you a **proposal skeleton** (same structure as your winning climate one, adapted to this TOR) so you can plug in details once you answer these 5?",

      "content": "I need some research actually for number one that would be something that I would need to dive into. I have some friends that are working on agriculture and working with women and mothers at home to create food for people regionally increasing jobs for women and I know of other projects that works on food. My friend said actually would be awesome to talk to you about this, but I don't have a lot of experience I don't know how to say it. I mean, I forage a lot personally I'm really deep into cooking and foraging and I make kombucha and sourdough, but I would have to do my research and I would love to do this research. I'm not sure how sophisticated the measurement should be. I feel like this is pretty early in Idaho and so it would be great just to have the kilogram saved and maybe some measures about like ecosystem health food distance food traveled I think is interesting. I know they're talking a lot about food waste but I'm wondering if we can go a little bit broader and then we can even connect like historically about food and food preservation techniques. This is one of the things I love to talk about because my grandma would tell me about making cold, cured sausages in dry heat, hanging them making so many things from the dates in their backyards from baskets to vinegar to date, molasses and date paste and cookies, and how seasonally connected things are and I feel like maybe there could be a really beautiful elements of knowledge preservation from our ancestors are like our grandmothers before it goes away, especially in terms of food preservation, and Iraqi are also really known to love their giant fridges, and it would be lovely to study the history of the fridge. You know I know that we used to have ice chest boxes and how did that work and what did they do when there was no more ice and that would be a beautiful thing as I'm not sure about translation because they didn't actually talk about it. Do they talk about it at all I would love to propose at least one TOT session, but tell them that follow up and connections would be more than welcome and I'm more than willing to come to Iraq if the budget allows yeah is the scope bigger there is the material production impact framework in TOT I think yeah maybe 4K. Can you help me think about you know making actually a table and what the budget might be for each of the things that's reasonable they can hire local so it would need to be reasonable for them to hire me from France to come just helpful. Do you need anything else and yeah, I'd like to have an updated proposal.",

Food waste in Iraqi restaurants (Filimonau et al., 2023)** ⭐ **HIGHLY RELEVANT**\n- **Actual Iraq-specific data**: 38g per capita food waste in Iraqi restaurants\n- Cultural factors: hospitality culture, large portions, over-ordering\n- Novel/effective approaches for Middle East market\n- This is gold for understanding Erbil context\n\n**3. FAO Food Loss and Waste in Arab World (systematic review, 2018)**\n- **Critical stat**: 210 kg per capita annually in Arab countries vs 95-115kg in Europe\n- Data gaps in 10 Arab countries including Iraq\n- Food bank initiatives and redistribution models in the region\n- Shows the opportunity space\n\n**4. Traditional Iraqi Fermented Foods (Journal of Ethnic Foods, 2022)** ⭐ **YOUR SECRET WEAPON**\n- Documents Iraq's 7500 BC food preservation tradition\n- Basturma, Turshi, date products, fermentation techniques\n- **Low commercialization** = entrepreneurship opportunity!\n- Connects to your grandmother's knowledge angle\n\n**5. Circular Economy & Food Waste (ReFED + UNCTAD reports)**\n- Entrepreneurship frameworks for food waste\n- Business Model Canvas adaptations for circular economy\n- Case studies of food waste social enterprises\n- Impact measurement approaches\n\n**6. NRC Iraq Drought & Food Security Report (Nov 2024)** ⭐ **CURRENT CONTEXT**\n- 1 in 2 Iraqi households cultivated less land in 2024\n- 59% reduced food expenditure\n- Climate-food security-income nexus\n- Shows urgency and context for the work\n\n## Your Honest Positioning - How to Frame It:\n\n**DON'T say**: \"I'm a food systems expert\"\n\n**DO say**: \"I specialize in curriculum adaptation for complex topics I don't initially know deeply - I've done this successfully with solar energy, insulation, and green architecture for ITC. My strength is synthesis: taking research findings and translating them into practical entrepreneurship tools that work in SWANA contexts.\"\n\n**Your Unique Angle** (this is actually brilliant):\n\"I want to integrate traditional Iraqi food preservation knowledge - which dates back 7500 years but risks being lost - with modern circular economy approaches. Entrepreneurs in Erbil don't just need Western frameworks; they need to see how their grandmothers' techniques (fermentation, sun-drying, date preservation) are actually cutting-edge circular economy practices.\"\n\nThis positions your \"gap\" as a **feature, not a bug**. You're not pretending to be a food scientist - you're positioning as someone who connects indigenous knowledge with modern entrepreneurship frameworks.\n\n## Budget Strategy & Breakdown:\n\n**Context check:**\n- Climate project: 4M IQD for 5 weeks, single deliverable stream\n- This project: 6 weeks, MORE complex (research synthesis + curriculum + materials + impact framework + ToT)\n- Question: In-person or remote?\n\n**My recommendation:** \nPrice at **4.5M - 5M IQD** (~$3,400-$3,800 USD) for remote work. If they want in-person facilitation in Erbil, add 1.3M IQD ($1,000) = **5.8M-6.3M IQD total**.\n\nHere's a transparent breakdown:\n\n| **Deliverable** | **Remote (IQD)** | **Notes** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Research Synthesis & Integration** | 1,200,000 | Review 3 research reports + 6 background sources, extract actionable insights, create integration outline |\n| **Curriculum Adaptation (4-day bootcamp)** | 1,800,000 | Adapt Five One Labs bootcamp format, integrate food waste/security content, develop exercises linking to entrepreneurship tools |\n| **Training Materials Development** | 1,000,000 | Slides, trainer guides, participant workbooks, case studies (localized + global) |\n| **Impact Framework Design** | 700,000 | Develop measurement system: kg saved, households reached, business outcomes, data collection tools |\n| **Training-of-Trainers Session** | 800,000 | Virtual ToT session + prep materials |\n| **TOTAL (Remote)** | **5,500,000** | ~$4,200 USD |\n\n| **If In-Person Required** | **Additional** |\n|---|---|\n| Travel to Erbil + accommodation | +1,300,000 | ~$1,000 USD |\n| **TOTAL (In-Person)** | **6,800,000** | ~$5,200 USD |\n\n**Reality Check**: Are they likely to hire someone from France?\n- **Yes, if**: You emphasize your Five One Labs track record, Kurdistan Region familiarity, Arabic fluency, and recent successful delivery\n- **No, if**: They have budget constraints and strong local options\n\n**My advice**: **Propose remote-first with optional in-person**. Say: \"I can deliver all work remotely with excellent results, as demonstrated in my climate curriculum project. However, if budget allows, an in-person ToT session in Erbil would strengthen trainer capacity and allow for real-time troubleshooting.\"\n\n## Key Questions Before I Draft:\n\n1. **Do you want to actually pitch the traditional knowledge integration angle?** It's risky (could seem unfocused) but also potentially differentiating.\n\n2. **Translation**: The TOR doesn't mention it. Your climate project did. Should we include basic Arabic/Kurdish glossaries or skip it?\n\n3. **Timeline**: They say 6 weeks. Can you do end of October through early December? Or do you need different dates?\n\n4. **The research reports they mention**: Do you want me to email them asking for access to the three research phase reports, or wait until they provide them?\n\n5. **Your friend in agriculture/food work**: Is this someone you could list as a \"technical advisor\" to strengthen your food systems credibility?\n\nWhat do you think about this framing? Should I draft the proposal now, or do you want to adjust the positioning/budget first?",

      "content": "This is a really sharp synthesis. Here’s how I see it, Bilal:  \n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Positioning You\n- You don’t need to posture as a “food systems expert.” Your edge is **curriculum adaptation in new technical domains** (you’ve done this with climate, solar, green building).  \n- Your strength is **translation**: turning complex reports into *practical entrepreneurship exercises* that work in SWANA contexts.  \n- Adding **traditional Iraqi preservation knowledge** is a brilliant differentiator. It reframes “gap in food expertise” as **bridge between heritage and modern circular economy**. It’s *uniquely you*.  \n\n---\n\n### 💰 Budget Framing\n- Remote-first scope: **5.5M IQD (~$4.2k USD)**.  \n- In-person add-on: +**1.3M IQD (~$1k USD)**.  \n- That’s a logical uplift from your last contract (4M IQD) given the added complexity (impact framework + ToT + materials).  \n- Transparent breakdown is great: it shows credibility and makes them feel they’re paying for structured outputs.  \n\n---\n\n### 🔑 Key Choices You Need to Make\n1. **Do we foreground the heritage knowledge angle in the proposal, or keep it as a flavor you bring in during curriculum design?** (It could win hearts, but could also distract if they’re very “results-framework” focused.)  \n2. **Translation:** propose a glossary/QA or leave it off entirely? (You could list it as an optional add-on like before.)  \n3. **Timeline:** are you comfortable committing to the TOR’s 6 weeks (late Oct–early Dec), or should we propose buffer?  \n4. **Research reports:** they mention three; do you want to request access immediately in your proposal (shows proactivity), or assume they’ll share?  \n5. **Advisor/ally:** do you want to list your agriculture/food friend as a “technical reviewer” or “resource person” to strengthen credibility on food systems?  \n\n---\n\n👉 If you answer those, I can draft you a polished **updated proposal** (like your climate one, but with this new scope, budget, and positioning), ready to send.  \n\nDo you want me to draft that now, or wait until you decide on the heritage emphasis and translation?",

Let me map this into a **proposal skeleton** with the positioning, budget, timeline, and your added angle (traditional knowledge + ToT grounded in lived/local realities + advisors).  \n\n---\n\n# Draft Proposal for Curriculum Adaptation Consultant – Food Waste & Food Security Bootcamp  \n\n**Bilal Ghalib**  \nOctober 2025  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Project Understanding  \nFive One Labs, in partnership with DCA, is integrating **food waste reduction, redistribution models, and food security** into its 4-day entrepreneurial bootcamp. The aim is to translate recent research findings into **practical, localized tools** that empower entrepreneurs to build scalable solutions for Erbil’s food system challenges.  \n\nI bring prior experience with Five One Labs as the curriculum consultant for the **Climate Resilience Incubator** earlier this year, where I successfully adapted 32 sessions to embed sustainability practices. My expertise lies not in being a food scientist, but in **synthesizing research, local knowledge, and global best practices** into entrepreneurship curriculum that is **engaging, contextualized, and measurable**.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Technical Approach & Methodology  \n\n**Step 1: Research Synthesis & Localization**  \n- Review the three research reports provided by Five One Labs and DCA.  \n- Integrate insights from recent studies (e.g. UNEP Food Waste Index 2024, Filimonau et al. 2023 on Iraq, FAO regional reviews, NRC 2024 on drought/food security).  \n- Curate **6–8 case studies**: regional (Lebanon community fridges, Egyptian Food Bank), global (UAE Food Bank, circular food startups), and Iraqi cultural practices (fermentation, date preservation, Turshi, sun-drying).  \n- Frame **traditional Iraqi food knowledge** (preservation, fermentation, dates economy) as assets for modern circular economy ventures.  \n\n**Step 2: Curriculum Adaptation (4-day Bootcamp)**  \n- Embed food waste & security themes into ideation, BMC, prototyping, and pitching modules.  \n- Develop tools such as: surplus-mapping canvas, redistribution partner scripts, “meals equivalent” calculator.  \n- Show participants how to turn community food challenges into viable enterprises.  \n\n**Step 3: Materials Development**  \n- Create slides, trainer notes, and participant workbooks.  \n- Provide localized case studies and exercises.  \n- Deliver editable, reusable materials in English (with optional AR/KU glossary support).  \n\n**Step 4: Impact Framework**  \n- Simple but robust indicators:  \n  - **kg of food saved**  \n  - **households/meals reached**  \n  - **redistribution partners onboarded**  \n  - **entrepreneur business results (revenue, unit economics)**  \n- Optional broader metrics: distance traveled, preservation wins, traditional methods revived.  \n- Provide an **Impact Kit** (definitions, data sheets, basic dashboard template).  \n\n**Step 5: Training-of-Trainers (ToT)**  \n- Deliver a **virtual ToT session (2–3 hours)** for FOL staff/facilitators.  \n- Include participatory elements: interviews, local stories, and knowledge-grounding exercises.  \n- Optional add-on: three follow-up coaching clinics.  \n- Open to in-person ToT delivery in Erbil if budget permits.  \n\n---\n\n## 3.

Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the policies and guidelines and the Manual of Style, but does not belong on this page.\n\nThis list is not a ban on certain words, phrases, or punctuation. No one is taking your em-dashes away or claiming that only LLMs use them. Not all text featuring the following indicators is AI-generated, as the large language models that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of very common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, specific to Wikipedia. While some of its advice may be broadly applicable, some signs—particularly those involving punctuation and formatting—may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.\n\nThe patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor wordsmithing, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry much more serious policy risks. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently tidied up), those surface defects might not be present, but the deeper problems likely will. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content and Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide.\n\nThe speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which can be found in § Communication intended for the user and the other two in § Citations. The other signs, though they may indeed indicate AI use, are not sufficient for speedy deletion.\n\nDo not solely rely on artificial intelligence content detection tools (such as GPTZero) to evaluate whether text is LLM-generated. While they perform better than random chance, these tools have nontrivial error rates and cannot replace human judgment.[1]\n\nLanguage and tone\nShortcuts\nWP:AIWTW\nWP:AI-ISM\nLLMs (and artificial neural networks in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to regress to the mean; that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a \"tell\" for detecting AI-generated content.\n\nFor example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. It will thus sand down specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the specific detail \"invented a train-coupling device\" might become \"a revolutionary titan of industry.\" LLMs tend to smooth out unusual details and drift toward the most common, statistically probable way of describing a topic. It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.[2]\n\nThis statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements that could apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.\n\nUndue emphasis on symbolism and importance\nWords to watch: stands as / serves as / is a testament, plays a vital/significant/crucial role, underscores its importance, highlights its significance, continues to captivate, leaves a lasting impact, watershed moment, key turning point, deeply rooted, profound heritage, steadfast dedication, indelible mark, solidifies ...\nLLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter with reminders that it represents or contributes to a broader topic.[3] There seems to be only a small repertoire of ways that it writes these reminders, so if they are otherwise appropriate it would be best to reword them anyway.\n\nWhen talking about biology (e.g. when asked to discuss a given animal or plant species), LLMs tend to put too much emphasis on the species' conservation status and the efforts to protect it, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist.\n\nExamples\n\nDouera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a dynamic hub of activity and culture. With its coastal charm and convenient location, Douera captivates both residents and visitors alike[...]\n\n— From this revision to Douéra\nBerry Hill today stands as a symbol of community resilience, ecological renewal, and historical continuity.

From its scenic landscapes to its historical landmarks, Alamata Raya Kobo offers visitors a fascinating glimpse into the diverse tapestry of Ethiopia.

Editorializing can appear through specific words or phrases or within broader sentence structures. This indicator often overlaps with other language and tone indicators in this list. Note that humans and especially new editors often make this mistake as well.\n\nExamples\n\nA defining feature of FSP models is their ability to simulate environmental interactions.\n\n— From Draft:Functional-Structural Plant Models\nTheir ability to simulate both form and function makes them powerful tools for understanding plant-environment interactions and optimizing performance under diverse biological and management contexts.\n\n— From the same page\nIn this case, the whole sentence comprises an original opinion:\n\nThese partnerships reflect the company’s role in serving both corporate and community organizations in Uganda.\n\n— From Draft:GEOWISE MEDIA\nOveruse of certain conjunctions\nWhile human writing obviously contains connecting words and phrases, LLMs tend to overuse them, in a stilted, formulaic way. This is often a byproduct of an essay-like structure that implies synthesis of facts, which is typical of LLM writing but inappropriate for Wikipedia.\n\nExamples\n\nAI-generated example\nCompare the above with below human-written prose. Even disregarding the absence of buzzwords and general vapidness, the connecting phrases in the below excerpt are more varied and less conspicuous.\n\nHuman-written example\nSection summaries\nShortcuts\nWP:CONCLUSION\nWP:INCONCLUSION\nWords to watch: In summary, In conclusion, Overall ...\nWhen generating longer outputs (such as when told to \"write an article\"), LLMs typically add a section titled \"Conclusion\" or similar, and will often end a paragraph or section by summarizing and restating its core idea.[4]\n\nExamples\n\nIn summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research. This structured pathway ensures that nurse scientists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of nursing science.\n\n— From this revision in Nurse scientist\nOutline-like conclusions about challenges and future prospects\nWords to watch: Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook ...\nMany LLM-generated Wikipedia articles include a \"Challenges\" section, which typically begins with a sentence like \"Despite its [positive/promotional words], [article subject] faces challenges...\" and ends with either a positive assessment of the article subject, or speculation about how ongoing or potential initiatives could benefit the subject. Such paragraphs usually appear at the end of articles with a rigid outline structure, which may also include a separate section for \"Future Prospects.\"\n\nNote: This sign is about the rigid formula, not simply the mention of challenges.\n\nExamples\n\nDespite its industrial and residential prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including[...] With its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive as an integral part of the Ambattur industrial zone, embodying the synergy between industry and residential living.\n\n— From this revision to Korattur\nDespite its success, the Panama Canal faces challenges, including[...] Future investments in technology, such as automated navigation systems, and potential further expansions could enhance the canal’s efficiency and maintain its relevance in global trade.\n\n— From this revision to Panama Canal\nDespite their promising applications, pyroelectric materials face several challenges that must be addressed for broader adoption.

This can take different forms from \"adjective, adjective, adjective\" to \"short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase\".[1] LLMs often use this structure to make superficial analyses appear more comprehensive.\n\nExamples\n\nThe Amaze Conference brings together global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers to discuss the latest trends in digital marketing. The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities.\n\n— From Draft:Amaze Conference\nSuperficial analyses\nShortcut\nWP:SUPERFICIAL\nWords to watch: ensuring ..., highlighting ..., emphasizing ..., reflecting ..., underscoring ..., aligns with...\nAI chatbots tend to insert superficial analysis of information, often in relation to its significance, recognition, or impact. This is often done by attaching a present participle (\"-ing\") phrase at the end of sentences, sometimes with vague attributions to third parties (see below).[3] These comments are generally unhelpful as they introduce unnecessary or fictional opinions.\n\nExamples\n\nIn 2025, the Federation was internationally recognized and invited to participate in the Asia Pickleball Summit, highlighting Pakistan’s entry into the global pickleball community.\n\n— From this revision to Draft:Pakistan Pickleball Federation\nConsumers benefit from the flexibility to use their preferred mobile wallet at participating merchants, improving convenience.\n\n— From Draft:MyanmarPay MMQR\nThese citations, spanning more than six decades and appearing in recognized academic publications, illustrate Blois' lasting influence in computational linguistics, grammar, and neology.\n\n— From this revision to Draft:Jacques Blois (linguist)\nThe civil rights movement emerged as a powerful continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice.\n\n— From this revision to African-American culture\nVague attributions of opinion\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Unsupported attributions.\nShortcut\nWP:AIWEASEL\nWords to watch: Industry reports, Observers have cited, Some critics argue ...\nAI chatbots tend to attribute opinions or claims to some vague authority—a practice called weasel wording—while citing only one or two sources that may or may not actually express such view. They also tend to overgeneralize a perspective of one or few sources into that of a wider group.\n\nExamples\n\nHere, the weasel wording implies the opinion comes from an independent source, but it actually cites Nick Ford's own website.\n\nHis [Nick Ford's] compositions have been described as exploring conceptual themes and bridging the gaps between artistic media.[a]\n\n— Draft:Nick Ford (musician)\nDue to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists.

The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range (e.g. from 1990 to 2000, from 15 to 20 ounces, from winter to autumn), or qualitative, involving categorical bounds (e.g. \"from seed to tree\", \"from mild to severe\", \"from white belt to black belt\"). The same constructions may be used to form a merism—a figure of speech that combines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative meaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable scale: from head to toe (the length of a body denoting the whole body), from soup to nuts (clearly based on time), etc. This is not a false range.\n\nLLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply mentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be identified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another scale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a false range. LLMs often employ \"figurative\" (often simply: meaningless) \"from ... to ...\" constructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or essentially unrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred. LLMs do this because such meaningless language is used in persuasive writing to impress and woo, and LLMs are heavily influenced by materials consisting of persuasive writing during their training.\n\nExamples\n\nOur journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars that forge the elements of life, to the enigmatic dance of dark matter and dark energy that shape its destiny.\n\n[...]\n\nIntelligence and Creativity: From problem-solving and tool-making to scientific discovery, artistic expression, and technological innovation, human intelligence is characterized by its adaptability and capacity for novel solutions.\n\n[...]\n\nContinued Scientific Discovery: The quest to understand the universe, life, and ourselves will continue to drive scientific breakthroughs, from fundamental physics to medicine and neuroscience.\n\n— From Draft:The Cosmos Unveiled: A Grand Tapestry of Existence\nStyle\nTitle case\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters § Headings, headers, and captions.\nShortcut\nWP:AITITLECASE\nIn section headings, AI chatbots strongly tend to consistently capitalize all main words (title case).[1]\n\nExamples\n\nEarly Life and Education\nThomas was born in Cochranville, Pennsylvania.

One of their tendencies, inherited from readmes, fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles and other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase, often in a \"key takeaways\" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.\n\nExamples\n\nIt blends OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and visual strategy tools such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and Balanced Scorecard (BSC). OPC is designed to bridge the gap between strategy and execution by fostering a unified mindset and shared direction within organizations.\n\n— From Draft:One Page 4 Change (OPC)\nInline-header vertical lists\nShortcut\nWP:AILIST\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists § Use prose where understood easily.\nAI chatbots' content often includes vertical lists. A particular list formatting is employed: It comprises an ordered or unordered list where the list marker (number, bullet, dash, etc.) is followed by an inline boldfaced header of sorts; a colon then separates it from the remaining descriptive text. (Separately from this sign, this is one of the things which cause overabundant boldfacing; see § Excessive use of boldface)\n\nInstead of proper wikitext, a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as 1.) instead of standard wikitext. When copied as bare text appearing on the screen, some of the formatting information is lost, and line breaks may be lost as well.\n\nExamples\n\n1.

LLMs especially tend to use em-dashes in a formulaic, pat way, often mimicking \"punching up\" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms.\n\nThis sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself.\n\nExamples\n\nElwandore is a virtual micronation for people with passion and skill — a place to build, to create, and to help each other grow while chasing wealth. But not wealth for greed — wealth to give, to help others, to donate.\n\n— From this version of Draft:United Digital Republic Of Elwandore\nThe term “Dutch Caribbean” is not used in the statute and is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people of the autonomous countries themselves. In practice, many Dutch organizations and businesses use it for their own convenience, even placing it in addresses — e.g., “Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean” — but this only adds confusion internationally and erases national identity. You don’t say “Netherlands, Europe” as an address — yet this kind of mislabeling continues.\n\n— From this revision to Talk:Dutch Caribbean\nCurly quotation marks and apostrophes\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Quotation characters, and Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Apostrophes.\nShortcut\nWP:AICURLY\nAI chatbots typically use curly quotation marks (“...” or ‘...’) instead of straight quotation marks (\"...\" or '...'). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’; the same character as the curly right single quotation mark) instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in contractions and possessive forms. They may also do this inconsistently.\n\nCurly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. Microsoft Word as well as macOS and iOS devices have a \"smart quotes\" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as LanguageTool may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like Citer may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example,\n\nMcClelland, Mac (2017-09-27). \"When 'Not Guilty' Is a Life Sentence\". The New York Times.

It may also pair it with text about what that information \"likely\" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely speculative (including the very claim that it's \"not documented\") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated. It is also frequently combined with the tells above.\n\nExamples\n\nWhile specific information about the fauna of Studniční hora is limited in the provided search results, the mountain likely supports...\n\n— From this revision to Studniční hora\nThough the details of these resistance efforts aren't widely documented, they highlight her bravery...\n\n— From this revision to Throwing Curves: Eva Zeisel\nNo significant public controversies or security incidents affecting Outpost24 have been documented as of June 2025.\n\n— From Draft:Outpost24\nAs of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about the current status or developments related to the \"Chester Mental Health Center\" in today's era.\n\n— From this revision to Chester Mental Health Center\nBelow is a detailed overview based on available information:\n\n— From Draft:The Good, The Bad, The Dollar Menu 2\nPrompt refusal\nWords to watch: as an AI language model, as a large language model, I'm sorry ...\nOccasionally, the AI chatbot will decline to answer a prompt as written, usually with an apology and a reminder that it is \"an AI language model\". Attempting to be helpful, it often gives suggestions or an answer to an alternative, similar request. Outright refusals have become increasingly rare.\n\nPrompt refusals are obviously unacceptable for Wikipedia articles, so if a user includes one anyway, it may indicate that they did not review the text and/or may not be proficient in English.

As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running on MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like Miraheze, LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data. While the corpuses of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: Markdown. Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using it, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia articles look like formatted documents.\n\nWhen asked about its \"formatting guidelines\", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level instructions will typically generate some variation of the following (this is Microsoft Copilot in mid-2025):\n\n## Formatting Guidelines\n\n- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.  \n- Use a single main title (`#`) and clear primary subheadings (`##`).  \n- Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences, ≤150 words).  \n- Break large topics into labeled subsections.  \n- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.  \n- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.  \n- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.  \n- Use horizontal dividers (`---`) between major sections.  \n- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.  \n- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.  \n- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.  \n- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.\nAs the above suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.\n\nEven when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using syntactically correct wikitext, as their training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in Markdown. When told to \"generate an article\", a chatbot will typically default to using Markdown for the generated output, which is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might \"realize\" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (`wikitext`)?[b] in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax will often be rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style fenced code block (its syntax for WP:PRE) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: ```wikitext.[c]\n\nThe presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like Obsidian and GitHub, and on platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Slack. Some writing tools and apps, such as iOS Notes, Google Docs, and Windows Notepad, support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.\n\nExamples\n\nSee also: Markdown § Examples\nI believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** — not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being “unhelpful”, and a general impression that I am \"not here to build an encyclopedia\". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments \"AI-generated\" — without explaining how they are substantively flawed.\n\n— From this revision to a user talk page\n- The Wikipedia entry does not explicitly mention the \"Cyberhero League\" being recognized as a winner of the World Future Society's BetaLaunch Technology competition, as detailed in the interview with THE FUTURIST ([1](https://consciouscreativity.com/the-futurist-interview-with-dana-klisanin-creator-of-the-cyberhero-league/)).

Most links become broken (see link rot) over time, but those factors make it unlikely that the link was ever valid.\n\nInvalid DOI and ISBNs\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see Wikipedia:DOI and Wikipedia:ISBN.\nA checksum can be used to verify ISBNs. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates will display a warning if so. Similarly, DOIs are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of hallucinated references.\n\nRelated are DOIs that point to entirely different article and general book citations without pages. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.\n\nOhm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1]. Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are \"ohmic,\" meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors [2][3].\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.).

Worse, both Proceedings of the IEEE citations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to completely different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, C. L. Fortescue was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and Vol 55, Issue 11 does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 3. Note also the use of curly quotation marks and apostrophes in some, but not all, of the above text, another indicator that text may be LLM-generated.\n\nIncorrect or unconventional use of references\nShortcut\nWP:AICITESTYLE\nAI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so as Wikipedia expects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.\n\nIn the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.\n\nIn this case, the Smith, R. J. source – being the \"third source\" the tool presumably generated the link 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3' (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{cite journal}} reference, even though the links resolve.\n\nThe LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.\n\nFor over thirty years, computers have been utilized in the rehabilitation of individuals with brain injuries.

Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited, and further responses will require the user to select \"continue generating\".\n\nThis method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a copyright violation rather than the use of an LLM.\n\nDiscrepancies in writing style and variety of English\nA sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools.\n\nAnother discrepancy is a mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[4] Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should only raise suspicion if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.\n\nAge of text relative to ChatGPT launch\nChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not particularly accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.\n\nIt is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia prior to November 30, 2022 was generated by an LLM. If an edit to a page was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some text added as far back as 20 years ago may appear to match some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.\n\nOverwhelmingly verbose edit summaries\nAI-generated edit summaries are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without abbreviations, and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.\n\nMost editors using AI do not ask for summaries to be generated.\n\nRefined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with Wikipedia's content guidelines.

Before claiming AI was used, consider if Dunning–Kruger effect and confirmation bias is clouding your judgement. In particular, there are several somewhat commonly used indicators which are ineffective (and may even indicate the opposite) in LLM detection.\n\nPerfect grammar: While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also § Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English.)\n\"Bland\" or \"robotic\" prose: By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as \"robotic\" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.[6]\nBizarre wikitext: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in § Use of Markdown, they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, \"inexplicable\" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in § Markup). Bizarrely placed HTML tags like <span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool (T113137). Misplaced syntax like ''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel. (rendered as \"Catch-22 is a satirical novel.\") are more indicative of mistakes in VisualEditor, where such errors are harder to notice than in source editing.",

You like grounded specifics (who, what, when, where), and you invite co-creation without slogans. Below is a tightened, “Bilal-ish” version that avoids the AI tells you flagged (no puffed symbolism, no “in conclusion,” no rule-of-three flourishes, minimal em-dashes, plain headings, straight talk).\n\n---\n\n# Proposal: curriculum adaptation consultant — food waste & food security bootcamp\n\n**Bilal Ghalib**  \nOctober 2025\n\n## project understanding\nFive One Labs and DCA are adding food waste reduction, redistribution models, and food security into the 4-day bootcamp in Erbil. My role: turn existing research into practical training that helps founders test real solutions quickly.\n\nI previously adapted Five One Labs’ climate curriculum. I’m not a food scientist; my strength is translating research and local practice into usable tools for entrepreneurs in this region.\n\n## approach\n\n1) research to practice  \n- Review the three project reports.  \n- Pull out what’s actionable for founders (surplus sources, partners, unit economics, simple ops).  \n- Build a small case pack: regional initiatives and Iraqi practices (fermentation, drying, date products) that can become business models.\n\n2) adapt the 4-day bootcamp  \n- Thread food waste/security through ideation, BMC, prototyping, and pitching.  \n- Add worksheets: surplus-mapping, partner outreach scripts, “meals equivalent” calculator, simple costing.\n\n3) materials  \n- Trainer slides and notes with a timed run-of-show.  \n- Participant workbook with canvases, checklists, and short exercises.  \n- All editable (Docs/Slides).\n\n4) lean impact framework  \n- Core: kilograms saved, households/meals reached, partners onboarded, basic unit economics.  \n- Optional: distance traveled for redistributed food; preservation wins using traditional methods.  \n- Provide definitions, a data sheet, and a lightweight tracker template.\n\n5) training of trainers (ToT)  \n- One virtual session (2–3 hours): walkthrough, practice, Q&A.  \n- Include short interviews/knowledge-gathering prompts so trainers can surface local methods and vendors during delivery.  \n- Optional follow-up clinics. In-person ToT in Erbil if budget allows.\n\n## work plan (6 weeks: late Oct–early Dec 2025)\n\n| step | deliverables | timing |\n|---|---|---|\n| research synthesis | 6–8 case notes + integration brief | weeks 1–2 |\n| curriculum adaptation | updated 4-day flow + tools | weeks 3–4 |\n| materials + impact kit | slides, trainer guide, participant workbook, tracker | week 5 |\n| ToT + finalization | ToT session, revisions, handover | week 6 |\n\n## fees\n\n**base (remote): 5,500,000 IQD (~$4,200)**\n\n| item | IQD |\n|---|---:|\n| research synthesis & integration | 1,200,000 |\n| curriculum adaptation (4-day) | 1,800,000 |\n| materials (slides, guide, workbook) | 1,000,000 |\n| impact framework kit | 700,000 |\n| ToT (virtual) + revisions | 800,000 |\n| **total** | **5,500,000** |\n\n**options**  \n- In-person ToT in Erbil: +1,300,000 IQD (~$1,000) + travel at cost.  \n- Trainer coaching (3× virtual clinics): +520,000 IQD (~$400).  \n- AR/KU glossary or translation QA: to be agreed if needed.\n\n## management and reporting\nReport to the Programs Team with MD oversight.

Project Understanding\n\nFive One Labs, in collaboration with DCA, seeks to integrate food waste and food security insights into its 4-day entrepreneurial bootcamp curriculum. This builds on research findings to equip entrepreneurs in Erbil with practical tools for developing scalable solutions to local food system challenges.\n\nHaving successfully delivered the Climate Resilience Curriculum for Five One Labs' 32-session Incubator Program earlier this year, I understand your pedagogical approach, your community of entrepreneurs, and the Kurdistan Region context. This proposal outlines how I will adapt your bootcamp format to address food waste reduction, redistribution models, and food security—grounded in both research evidence and local cultural knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Technical Approach & Methodology\n\nMy methodology bridges research synthesis with participatory knowledge generation, recognizing that the most effective entrepreneurship training in Iraq integrates evidence-based frameworks with indigenous practices.\n\n### Phase 1: Research Synthesis & Contextual Grounding (Weeks 1-2)\n\n**Research Review**\n- Deep analysis of the three research phase reports you'll provide\n- Integration of relevant global frameworks:\n  - UNEP Food Waste Index 2024 (measurement methodology & impact indicators)\n  - Iraqi food systems research (Filimonau et al., 2023 on cultural factors in food waste)\n  - FAO Arab World food loss data and redistribution models\n  - Circular economy entrepreneurship frameworks\n\n**Traditional Knowledge Integration** *(Methodological Innovation)*\n- Conduct 8-10 structured interviews with families in Erbil about traditional food preservation practices\n- Document indigenous techniques: fermentation (turshi, liban), sun-drying, date preservation, seasonal storage\n- This grounds the curriculum in local reality rather than importing only Western frameworks\n- Positions Iraqi entrepreneurs as stewards of 7,500 years of Mesopotamian food knowledge, not just recipients of \"modern\" solutions\n\n**Deliverable**: Integration outline showing how research findings + traditional practices inform each bootcamp module\n\n### Phase 2: Curriculum Development (Weeks 3-4)\n\n**Bootcamp Structure Adaptation**\nBuilding on Five One Labs' proven methodology (customer discovery, ideation, business model canvas, prototyping, pitching), I will:\n\n- Design 4-day bootcamp flow integrating food waste/security at each stage\n- Develop exercises linking entrepreneurship tools to food systems context\n  - Example: Business Model Canvas exercise using \"food saved\" as key metric alongside revenue\n  - Example: Customer interview guide specifically for food waste stakeholders (restaurants, markets, households)\n- Create localized case studies:\n  - EcoFeed Tunisia (circular economy feed production)\n  - Iraqi fermented foods commercialization opportunities\n  - Regional food redistribution models (It'aam Saudi Arabia, Lebanese Food Bank)\n- Adapt standard tools (lean canvas, validation board) for food systems ventures\n\n**Materials Creation**\n- Trainer slides with speaker notes (English, with Arabic/Kurdish glossary)\n- Participant workbooks with practical exercises\n- Facilitator guide with timing, transitions, and troubleshooting\n- Resource library with relevant research excerpts\n\n**Deliverable**: Complete bootcamp curriculum package ready for trainer delivery\n\n### Phase 3: Impact Framework & ToT (Weeks 5-6)\n\n**Impact Measurement Design**\nDevelop practical framework aligned with early-stage ventures:\n- **Quantitative metrics**: kg food saved/redistributed, households reached, ventures launched, revenue generated\n- **Qualitative indicators**: behavior change, ecosystem engagement, knowledge preservation\n- **Data collection tools**: simple tracking sheets, post-bootcamp surveys, 3-month follow-up protocol\n- Dashboard template for Five One Labs to monitor outcomes\n\n**Training-of-Trainers**\n- Virtual ToT session (3 hours) with Five One Labs team\n- Practice facilitation of key modules\n- Adaptation strategies for different audiences\n- Q&A and troubleshooting scenarios\n\n**Deliverable**: Impact framework documentation + ToT facilitation + trainer certification\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why This Approach Works\n\n**Proven Track Record**: My successful climate curriculum integration (January-February 2025) demonstrated my ability to adapt complex topics into Five One Labs' format while maintaining bootcamp energy and practical focus.\n\n**Cultural Competency**: As an Iraqi-American who grew up learning traditional food preservation from my grandmother (date molasses, cold-cured meats, fermentation), I understand how to honor local knowledge while introducing new frameworks. My Arabic fluency enables nuanced understanding of cultural context.\n\n**Pedagogical Design Expertise**: My Master's in Education Sciences from Université de Paris specialized in curriculum adaptation. I've successfully designed learning experiences for topics I initially didn't know deeply (solar energy, sustainable architecture, insulation) through rigorous research synthesis and participatory design—exactly what this project requires.\n\n**Food Systems Network**: While I'm not a food scientist, I bring relevant connections:\n- Technical advisor: **Shariha Khalid** (Co-founder, Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur; circular economy expertise through work with Circle Economy; +SocialGood Connector)\n- Network: World Food Hub (halal-certified food systems, sustainability)\n- Collaborators: Friends working on regional agriculture and women-led food production\n\n**Entrepreneurship Training Excellence**: Through Bloom, I've supported 933+ ventures across 16 countries, designed wellbeing-integrated accelerators, and conducted numerous ToTs—including ITC programs on solar, insulation, and architecture, all topics outside my initial expertise.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Work Plan & Timeline\n\n**Duration**: 6 weeks (Late October – Early December 2025)\n\n| Phase | Deliverables | Timeframe |\n|-------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Research Synthesis & Contextual Grounding** | - Integration outline<br>- Traditional knowledge documentation<br>- Feedback iteration | Weeks 1-2 |\n| **Curriculum Development** | - 4-day bootcamp curriculum<br>- Trainer & participant materials<br>- Case studies & exercises | Weeks 3-4 |\n| **Impact Framework & ToT** | - Measurement framework & tools<br>- Virtual ToT session<br>- Complete curriculum package | Weeks 5-6 |\n\n**Check-ins**: Weekly virtual meetings with Five One Labs team for feedback and iteration.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Financial Proposal\n\n**Total Investment: 5,500,000 IQD** (Remote delivery)  \n*Inclusive of all project expenses, research, materials development, and consultancy fees*\n\n| Deliverable | Investment (IQD) |\n|------------|------------------|\n| Research Synthesis & Integration | 1,200,000 |\n| Curriculum Development | 1,800,000 |\n| Materials Development | 1,000,000 |\n| Impact Framework Design | 700,000 |\n| Training-of-Trainers Session | 800,000 |\n| **TOTAL** | **5,500,000** |\n\n**Optional Add-on**: In-person ToT facilitation in Erbil (+1,300,000 IQD for travel/accommodation)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Payment Terms\n\n- **Schedule**: 50% upon contract signing, 50% upon completion of all deliverables (expected early December 2025)\n- **Method**: Bank transfer\n- **Currency**: IQD (inclusive of applicable taxes)\n\n---\n\n## 7. Request for Research Materials\n\nTo begin this work effectively, I would appreciate access to:\n1. The three research phase reports referenced in your TOR\n2. Five One Labs' current 4-day bootcamp curriculum structure\n3. Any existing food waste/security materials or pilots you've tested\n\nI'm happy to sign an NDA if needed for proprietary materials.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Evidence of Past Work\n\nI'd be pleased to share examples from our recent collaboration:\n- Climate Resilience Curriculum (January-February 2025) - [can provide materials upon request]\n- Bloom's Wellbeing & Impact ToT framework\n- ITC curriculum co-development projects (solar, insulation, architecture)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Closing Statement\n\nFood waste in Iraq represents both an urgent challenge and a profound opportunity. By integrating research evidence with the 7,500-year heritage of Iraqi food preservation knowledge, we can create a curriculum that doesn't just teach Western frameworks—it positions Erbil's entrepreneurs as innovators continuing an ancient tradition of resourcefulness and circular thinking.\n\nI'm excited to bring my curriculum design expertise, cultural understanding, and proven track record with Five One Labs to make this bootcamp a powerful catalyst for food systems entrepreneurship in Kurdistan Region.\n\nI look forward to continuing our partnership.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\n**Bilal Ghalib**  \nEducational Research Consultant  \nMaster's in Education Sciences, Université de Paris  \nCo-founder & Head of Research, Bloom\n\nbg@bilalghalib.com  \n+14782272253\n\n---\n\n*References available upon request*\nand return a merged better one ",

I'm here to learn from people doing this work, not reinvent wheels.\n\n**Cultural context:** Iraqi-American, Arabic speaker. Learned traditional preservation from my grandmother in Baghdad. I get the context but won't romanticize it.\n\n**Entrepreneurship background:** Co-founder of Bloom, 933+ ventures across 16 countries. I've run accelerators and know what works under time pressure.\n\n---\n\n## Note on local knowledge\n\nWhere it helps the venture logic, I'll include Iraqi preservation techniques as business paths. This is about finding what already works and connecting it to modern business tools, not cultural decoration. Scoped to what supports bootcamp outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Contact\n\nBilal Ghalib  \nbg@bilalghalib.com  \n+1-478-227-2253\n\nBased in Lille, France.
