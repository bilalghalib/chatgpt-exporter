The average time to diagnose PCOS is over two years, and many women are prescribed generic pills that fail to address the root cause of their condition.   I identified this issue through my own struggle with PCOS and the frustration of receiving incomplete or ineffective treatments. But beyond my personal experience, I noticed a critical lack of awareness among women—every time I spoke with girls experiencing irregular cycles, they knew something was wrong, but they didn’t have the knowledge or the right medical guidance to understand their hormonal health. Many didn’t even know the term PCOS.   Shockingly, this wasn’t just the case in Lebanon—it was the same in France during my master’s studies. Even in developed healthcare systems, women are left navigating their hormonal imbalances without proper education or solutions. This global gap in awareness and healthcare accessibility inspired me to build Inbalance—a platform that ensures women receive the knowledge, diagnosis, and treatment they truly deserve.\tInbalance is an AI-powered health platform that helps women easily track, diagnose, and manage hormonal imbalances such as PCOS, and  thyroid disorders.  Millions of women struggle with hormonal issues, yet 60% remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, and it takes an average of 4-6 years to receive proper care. Many are given generic treatments like birth control, which fail to address the root cause. At Inbalance, we simplify women’s healthcare by providing:  🔹 AI-driven diagnosis & personalized treatment plans – Our smart system analyzes medical history, symptoms, menstrual cycles, and lifestyle factors to provide 95% accurate diagnoses and tailored health recommendations.   🔹 Easy health tracking through text and image – Users can track their symptoms, periods, mood, and physical changes by simply entering text descriptions or uploading images (e.g., skin conditions, weight changes). Our AI analyzes this data to detect patterns and provide insights.   🔹 Expert-guided care – Women get direct access to endocrinologists, gynecologists, nutritionists, and mental health professionals, ensuring they receive the right care beyond generic medications.   🔹 A supportive community – Our platform offers a safe space for women to share experiences, get advice, and stay motivated on their health journey.   By combining AI technology, expert medical support, and seamless health tracking through text and image, Inbalance empowers women to take control of their hormonal health with ease and get the care they truly deserve.  \tYes\tWomen's Health Accelerator - Flat6Labs & Organon 2024\tGoogle or other search engine\tAt Inbalance, we are committed to transforming women’s healthcare through AI-driven solutions, ensuring that every woman receives the personalized care she deserves.

Traditional farming methods often rely on excessive water use, chemical pesticides, and large land areas, making them unsustainable and inefficient, especially in regions with limited agricultural space.  I first identified this issue through my background in agricultural and environmental engineering, where I studied the challenges of conventional farming. Additionally, my hands-on experience in hydroponics during my internship at BeLeaf exposed me to innovative, resource-efficient solutions. Seeing the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options, I realized the need for a scalable, urban-friendly agricultural system that could provide fresh produce year-round while minimizing environmental impact.\tMy startup, Urban Leaf, is a hydroponic farming business that focuses on producing fresh, pesticide-free, and sustainably grown leafy greens and legumes. Using hydroponic techniques, we grow crops without soil, utilizing nutrient-rich water solutions that reduce water consumption by up to 90% compared to traditional farming. This method allows us to maximize space efficiency, produce crops year-round, and eliminate the need for chemical pesticides, ensuring healthier food for consumers.  Our solution directly addresses the challenges of conventional agriculture by providing a sustainable, resource-efficient alternative that enhances food security.

But turning that vision into reality wasn’t easy. It required persistence, learning, and—most importantly—support from incredible people who believed in this journey. One of the biggest pillars of support has been Nawaya, whose funding and mentorship gave me the push to establish my mini farm. Their guidance helped me move from an idea to an actual operating business, allowing me to invest in the right infrastructure and begin production. I also want to celebrate my family, especially my husband, Hussein. His knowledge of agriculture and experience in pest management have been invaluable. From day one, he stood by me, helping refine our farming techniques and ensuring that our crops thrive. His father, too, brought wisdom from years of farming, proving that tradition and innovation can work hand in hand. And my sister, who has been learning and handling the marketing, played a key role in making sure our products reach the right audience. This journey hasn’t been without challenges—securing more investment, scaling up production, and overcoming market barriers—but the support from my network keeps me moving forward. I celebrate everyone who has contributed to Urban Leaf’s growth, from mentors to customers who trust our products. As we look ahead, I remain committed to expanding Urban Leaf, bringing fresh, healthy food to more people, and making hydroponic farming a key player in Lebanon’s agricultural future.

This results in high electricity bills, limited access to hot water, and frequent frustration.    I first thought about a solution when I realized that many times we turn on the boiler but either don’t use the heated water or only use a small portion of it. We do this to ensure hot water is available in case we decide to take a bath, avoiding the long wait time of nearly an hour. This was especially frustrating as electricity bills kept rising, and debt to the electricity company and generator owner kept increasing. At one point, the generator owner even threatened to cut the power supply. All of this was happening during Lebanon’s financial crisis, which I was personally experiencing. This pushed me to find a more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable solution—leading to the development of Ecobath.    With an **on-demand and fast water heater**, we only turn it on when we are sure we will take a bath. Since it heats water quickly and only the required amount, there is no fear of long waiting times or unnecessary energy consumption.\tEcobath is a bath water heater that heats only the required amount, saving electricity, reducing heating time, and minimizing pollution.\tYes\tIDEALAB and REAF with Berytech and Park Innovation.\tWord of Mouth\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tdara@bloom.pm\tYes\t8, #ERROR!, #ERROR!, #ERROR!\t8\t4\tIt was lovely to hear the positive feedback from most people!, The startup guesthouse in Akkar, and the glasses startup, the app for special needs (little stars), All the teams in my room (I don't remember all the startups names) gave me valuable advices in my main challenge, an electrical engineering also gave valuable advice regarding the latest technologies in electricity (I forgot the startup name, she's a female) I want to celebrate her.\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nBeaver Ed in ACSI4\tJana Barhouche\tjanafbarhouche@gmail.com\tBeaver Ed\tFirst and foremost, what’s motivating me right now is the chance to work in education. I studied economics at university and tried different jobs in finance, market research, and entrepreneurship. I didn’t realize it at the time, but with each experience and interaction, I was slowly uncovering my passion for education and its potential—when done right. So when my older brother, Rayan, pitched the idea of working together on an educational game and asked me to handle the educational program and operations, you can imagine how excited I was! Second, Rayan and I had always talked about how great it would be to work together. We’re well aware of the challenges of working with family, but we also know each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Our skills are complementary, and we share a similar vision and passion. These past few months have only reinforced that. I’m working full-time while Rayan is part-time, and we’re following the EOS model for our meetings and accountability. Having such a synergetic team and a healthy, empowering work environment has been a blessing. And finally, let’s be real—starting a startup in Lebanon is overwhelming, especially since I fully committed to Beaver in October 2024, right when the war escalated. But weirdly enough, that challenge has been motivating. I get to structure my time based on my energy, really understand my limits and strengths, and push myself accordingly. I love learning, and in my last job, I hit a plateau. So this new adventure is the perfect mix—working on something I’m passionate about, with a mission I truly believe in, while also constantly learning. Honestly, I could go on and on about this question, but in short—I’m really happy with my decision to dive headfirst into this unknown adventure. It just feels right!\tI am the managing partner at Beaver, responsible for operations and the development of our educational program. I’ll also be leading our market testing, which kicks off in early March with a Lebanese school and various scout groups. As our team grows, I will transition into the CEO role. I bring strong organizational skills, responsibility, and creative problem-solving—key qualities for managing operations and tackling day-to-day challenges. But I believe my greatest strengths, are my resilience and perseverance. When I was 12, I was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, a chronic condition marked by joint pain and fatigue. It began with my right hand and gradually spread to all my joints, including both hands, knees, ankles, back, and neck. Rather than giving up, I chose to see it as both a challenge and a gift. Living with it has never been easy, but I am grateful for what it has taught me: patience, perseverance, empathy, the courage to ask for help, and adaptability. It’s also taught me to remain optimistic and keep going, no matter the difficulties.  Beyond that, my leadership experience in volunteer movements has been instrumental in shaping how I approach education. My years in scouting helped me understand the incredible potential kids have when given the freedom to create. I founded two new units—one for girls aged 8 to 12 and another for teenage girls aged 12 to 17—before becoming the first female leader of my 35-year-old scout group. I led 300 boys and girls aged 8 to 24 and trained the leaders of nine different units. That experience taught me how to lead diverse teams, work with people from different backgrounds and age groups, and recognize the unique potential in each individual—something that directly aligns with Beaver Ed’s mission. Ultimately, I bring a mix of structure, creativity, and resilience to the team, all of which are crucial in shaping both our educational program and the company’s future.\thttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jana-barhouche/\tFemale\t25-29\tLebanon\tLebanon\t96171981638\t2024-10-07\tLebanon\tYes\tEducation; General / Other\tSDG GOAL 4: Quality Education:::SDG GOAL 5: Gender Equality:::SDG GOAL 3: Good Health and Well-being:::SDG GOAL 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth:::SDG GOAL 9: Industry / Innovation / Infrastructure:::SDG GOAL 1: No Poverty:::SDG GOAL 10: Reduced Inequality:::SDG GOAL 12: Responsible Consumption and Production\tOur mission is to provide an educational tool that allows students to experiment with theories learned in class, making learning more tangible, engaging, and effective. We aim to empower kids to discover their unique strengths while fostering problem-solving, teamwork, creativity, divergent thinking, and acceptance of different perspectives. Beaver Ed is revolutionizing education by combining hands-on construction kits with digital learning, equipping students with essential skills for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Education was structured around memorization, pre-made solutions, and rigid right-or-wrong answers, leaving no room for exploration or discovery. This system was originally designed to produce disciplined factory workers—but in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is no longer effective. Also, the lack of hands-on discovery and experimentation can reduce information retention to as low as 5%. This is supported by both the Learning Pyramid and the research of Joyce and Showers, which emphasize the importance of experiential and hands-on learning in increasing information retention to 90%.  Our firsthand experience reinforced this realization. My co-founder, Rayan, founded Bildits, a realistic construction toy integrated into 200+ schools in 5 countries. In 2020, he sold Bildits to a Dubai-based consortium, which is now expanding it into schools across the UAE, KSA, and Europe. I worked at Bildits as an instructor, and together, we saw how hands-on tools transformed the learning experience, making education more engaging, interactive, and effective. One key insight from Bildits was that schools want to innovate but are often hesitant to adopt solutions that add logistical complexity. This inspired us to create Beaver Ed—a hands-on, discovery-based learning tool that seamlessly integrates into classrooms without adding extra workload for teachers or schools.  To validate our idea, we conducted interviews with parents, students, teachers, and school principals:  - Students want more than just theoretical lessons and standardized exams—they want learning to be fun, interactive, and rooted in real-world experiences.  - Parents seek customized learning approaches that recognize their children’s unique strengths. Many feel the traditional system undervalues creativity, social skills, and problem-solving, often harming self-esteem.  - Teachers want their students to excel in official exams but are limited by rigid national curricula. Many try to introduce innovative methods, but these efforts rely on their personal motivation and extra effort.  - School principals aim to advance their institutions but tend to avoid solutions that require significant structural changes or additional workload. Beaver Ed is designed to address the needs of all stakeholders—offering an effortless yet impactful solution that transforms learning into a more engaging, effective, and future-proof experience.  Additionally, the World Economic Forum's report, Schools of the Future: Defining New Models of Education for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, emphasizes the urgent need for educational transformation. Traditional curricula fail to prepare students for the demands of the future workforce. Schools must prioritize creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, and lifelong learning—all of which are at the core of Beaver Ed.\tMixing hands-on and online learning for a better education, Beaver Ed is a construction educational kit designed for schools to help students understand and manually explore the scientific and mathematical concepts they learn in class. The kit aims to promote pure, raw creativity using simple construction materials: wooden bars. Additionally, it provides access to an educational program and a gamified experience that blends real-world applications with digital fun. Our goal is to empower kids to discover and believe in their unique strengths and to guide education towards problem-solving, teamwork, creativity, divergent thinking, and the acceptance of diverse perspectives.  The Beaver physical kit is a hands-on construction tool that includes 50 cm wooden sticks, a safe cutter that allows customizable cuts, and different types of recycled plastic joints for 90-degree and multi-angle connections and rotations. The kit also features a rope for creating mechanisms like cranks, pivoting joints, or even wooden gears, allowing students to construct various structures. We call this 'raw creativity.'    As for schools enrolled in the Beaver Educational Program, each year, the students will receive a kit and participate in monthly challenges via our educational platform. These challenges require students to apply classroom theories in real-world scenarios using our kit. Our curriculum is customized for each school and program, ensuring alignment with their theoretical curriculum. For example, rather than simply drawing a 4 cm line, students might be tasked with connecting two desks by building a bridge. They would measure the distance and cut wooden pieces to the correct length. Challenges start with simple tasks and progress to advanced applications of physics and math concepts. For instance, students may be challenged to construct a crane, considering factors like momentum, range of motion, and weight support.  After each challenge, the Beaver team reviews submissions, providing feedback to students and teachers on both academic and non-graded skills, like creativity, to highlight each student’s unique strengths.    Additionally, we offer a gamified approach to these challenges. In collaboration with online education platforms like Synthesis, which use digital games for learning, Beaver can be integrated into these digital environments. When a character in the game encounters an obstacle, students can construct a physical solution with the Beaver kit, then scan their structure to appear on screen for their character to use. For instance, if the character needs to climb a wall, students build a ladder, scan it, and their character can then climb it. Students can build various structures to assist their character—like bridges, catapults, planes, or boats—blending hands-on creativity with digital learning.\tNo\tWe didn't participate in a program under Beaver Ed yet.

The modern sedentary lifestyle, characterized by long hours of desk work and irregular eating habits, has significantly contributed to the increased incidence of metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. Individuals often struggle to incorporate regular physical activity and maintain a healthy diet, leading to frequent glucose spikes and long-term health complications.  We first identified this problem through personal experiences and observations within our community. As students and professionals, we noticed the difficulty in maintaining a healthy lifestyle amidst busy schedules. Conversations with peers, family members, and healthcare professionals highlighted the common challenges faced by those at risk of or managing diabetes. This realization motivated us to develop an innovative solution that addresses the root causes of glucose spikes and offers a practical, non-invasive method for glucose management.\tHi Health (HiH) is a health tech startup focused on revolutionizing glucose management for individuals leading sedentary lifestyles. Our flagship product is the Hi Health (HiH) device, designed to burn glucose while users are seated, seamlessly integrating into their daily routines.  ----Solution:---------------  -Hi Health Device:  Technology: The device leverages the Soleus Push-Up (SPU) exercise, targeting the soleus muscle in the calf, which has been scientifically proven to burn glucose directly from the blood. This exercise is highly effective for regulating blood glucose levels and improving metabolic health.  Design: Hi Health features a ground pad that users place on the floor and engage with while sitting. The device measures the number of SPU repetitions, calculates the glucose burned, and displays real-time data on a built-in screen.  Non-Invasive: Unlike traditional glucose monitoring methods that require finger-prick tests or continuous monitoring, Hi Health offers a non-invasive solution, providing a convenient and user-friendly experience.  -Companion App:  Personalized Insights: The companion app provides users with personalized health insights, progress tracking, and recommendations based on their activity data, dietary habits, and glucose burn patterns.  Future Features: Future iterations of the app will include dietary tracking, an expanded exercise library, and social community features to enhance user engagement and support. ----------------------------------- Targeted Users:  Office Workers and Students: Individuals who spend long hours sitting at desks and struggle to find time for regular exercise. Health-Conscious Individuals: Those who seek convenient solutions to manage their glucose levels and overall metabolic health. Pre-Diabetic and Diabetic Patients: Individuals at risk of or managing diabetes who need effective tools for glucose management. ---------------------------------- Market Opportunity:  Global Reach: Targeting local markets such as Jordan, with plans to expand into the MENA region, Asia-Pacific, and other global markets where diabetes prevalence is high. --------------------------------- Affordability: Priced at $50 per unit, Hi Health is designed to be an affordable and accessible solution for a broad audience.\tYes\tEntrepreneurship Hakathon 2024 by  Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship\tWord of Mouth\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tYes\t8, #ERROR!, #ERROR!\t8\t4\tI'd like to celebrate by creating art and support my team with it, Just the free open room to talk and chase Belal across rooms\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nTakadam in ACSI4\tHany Anan\thany@takadam.com\tTakadam\tRight now, what's driving me is the chance to really make a difference and have some fun along the way. Personally, I'm always inspired by the young people in Lebanon. They've got so much potential, and despite all the tough stuff they face, they keep pushing forward. That keeps me going too. Professionally, I’ve been in the startup scene for a while, working on small projects here and there. But for 2025, my new year revolution was that I decided it was time to go big. I wanted to build something that could grow and let me finally quit my UN job. So, here I am, probably on the coldest night of the year, filling out this application, ready to take my shot with my baby Takadam. It’s not just about building a new platform; it’s about setting up a future where every young person can grab the chances they deserve.\tAs the driving force behind our team, I consider myself both the fuel and the dynamo. My role is to keep us moving forward, harnessing my seven years of experience in empowering youth at both national and regional levels. My technical skills in coding and web development allow us to use technology not just effectively, but impactfully. I bring a constant stream of ideas and an endless supply of motivation, pushing our team to innovate and excel in creating meaningful opportunities for the youth.\thttps://www.linkedin.com/in/hany-anan/\tMale\t25-29\tLebanon\tLebanon\t96170300206\t2021-04-20\tLebanon\tYes\tTechnology; General / Other\tSDG GOAL 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth:::SDG GOAL 4: Quality Education\tThrough Takadam, I aim to make a significant impact on several Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Our objective is to empower at least 10,000 young individuals in Lebanon within the first two years by connecting them to educational and employment opportunities that match their skills and aspirations. By providing a platform that simplifies the search and application process for opportunities, we aim to increase the employment rate among our users by 25% and enhance their educational outcomes, as evidenced by a 30% increase in scholarship and training program enrollments. Moreover, we plan to reduce the opportunity gap for women and underrepresented communities by ensuring that at least 40% of our beneficiaries come from these groups. Long-term, Takadam seeks to be a catalyst for economic stability and social equity, contributing to a more informed, employed, and equitable society, where every individual has the chance to thrive.\tTech & Innovation:::Entrepreneurship\t3.2.

This issue stems from a fragmented information landscape where opportunities are scattered across various platforms, often buried in noise or not tailored to individual needs and qualifications.  I first identified this problem through my extensive work with youth in entrepreneurship training and social development programs. Over the years, I observed a recurring pattern: many young individuals were either unaware of the opportunities available to them or found the application process too daunting and time-consuming. This led to high levels of frustration and missed chances that could potentially alter their career paths and educational journeys.  Recognizing the critical gap between available opportunities and the youth’s access to them, I was motivated to develop a centralized platform that not only aggregates these opportunities but also offers tools to streamline and personalize the search process. Takadam aims to bridge this gap, making it easier for young individuals to find and apply for opportunities that can truly change their lives.\tTakadam is a dynamic digital platform designed to revolutionize how young people in Lebanon access and leverage opportunities for personal and professional development. Our solution addresses the complex challenge of opportunity discovery and application by centralizing a vast array of opportunities—including jobs, internships, scholarships, workshops, and more—into a single, user-friendly platform.  What sets Takadam apart is its smart matching technology, which personalizes the search experience based on the user’s profile, preferences, and past interactions. This ensures that users don't just find opportunities; they find the right opportunities that match their skills and aspirations. Additionally, our platform provides essential tools such as deadline reminders, application tracking, and eligibility filters to simplify the process and reduce the time users spend searching for and applying to opportunities.  Our aim is to empower the youth of Lebanon by making opportunity access as straightforward and efficient as possible, ultimately fostering a more connected and informed community that can thrive in an increasingly competitive world.\tYes\tInjaz Company Program UNDP Youth Leadership Programme Incubation Bloom Hackathon in partnership with FNF AUB Innovation Park\tBloom Social Media\tI am excited to hear back from you very soon!

Spaces feel cold, products feel mass-produced, and brands often miss the chance to create emotional connections through design.   As three sisters living in different countries, we’ve always shared a deep appreciation for beauty, storytelling, and the power of thoughtful design. Whether through art, interiors, or branding, we’ve seen firsthand how aesthetics influence emotions and well-being.  We created Home of Flora to bridge this gap; bringing nature-inspired, soulful designs into everyday products, spaces, and brand experiences. We first identified this when walking into spaces that felt empty, seeing products that lacked soul, and realizing how much warmth and meaning could be added through thoughtful design. The more we observed, the more we saw a gap in the market for brands that wanted to connect with people on a deeper level but lacked the artistic vision to do so. That’s where we knew we could make a difference.\tHome of Flora is a design studio founded by three sisters, united by a shared passion: to brighten up people's life with our signature art. We create nature-inspired, hand-painted watercolor art that brings warmth, depth, and emotion to brands, products, and spaces.  Our solution is simple yet powerful: we bridge the gap between brands and their audiences through exclusive, soulful designs that evoke emotion and connection. Whether through art licensing, custom patterns, or product collaborations, we help brands integrate beauty and nature into their offerings in a way that feels authentic and deeply engaging.  For us, it’s never just about creating something beautiful, it’s about making people feel something. We want our art to turn ordinary moments into meaningful ones, to bring a sense of calm, nostalgia, or joy. Whether it’s a pattern on fabric, packaging, or a space, we believe thoughtful design has the power to leave a lasting impact and sense of belonging in a world that craves more warmth and connection.\tNo\t-\tBloom Alumni\tWe are three sisters, three women, three mothers; each from a different field, yet united by a shared vision.

Fashion is one of the most polluting industries in the world, with millions of tons of clothing ending up in landfills each year. Waste comes not only from discarded garments but also from unsold inventory, textile offcuts, and the constant demand for 'newness' that leads to excessive production.  I first identified this issue while observing the growing amount of discarded textiles in landfills and the increasing awareness around sustainability. I realized that a major part of the problem lies in the linear 'take-make dispose' model of fashion. It became clear that there is a need for a shift toward a more circular approach designing clothes that are made to last, are recyclable, or can be upcycled, and ultimately creating a zero-waste fashion line that minimizes environmental harm.\tMy startup is dedicated to revolutionizing the fashion industry by upcycling second hand fabrics and repurposing already existing materials to create stylish, high quality garments. The goal is to minimize the environmental impact of fashion by giving new life to pre loved textiles that would otherwise go to waste. We source materials from vintage garments, surplus fabric from manufacturers, and discarded textiles, transforming them into unique, one of a kind pieces.  Our solution lies in our sustainable design approach, where we creatively repurpose these materials to craft collections that are not only eco friendly but also affordable and fashion forward. By reducing the demand for new fabrics and promoting the reuse of existing materials, we help reduce textile waste and lessen the strain on resources, all while supporting a more circular economy.  Through this approach, we aim to challenge the fast fashion industry’s reliance on mass production and disposal, offering consumers a more responsible and stylish alternative. Our pieces are not just sustainable they are also unique and tell a story, allowing customers to wear fashion that aligns with their values and supports a more sustainable future.\tYes\tDezain bootcamp 2023\tWord of Mouth\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tYes\t7, #ERROR!\t8\t4\tThe community is not working fine with me\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nSustainable Stitch in ACSI4\tLilian Malaeb\tsustainablestitchinitiative@gmail.com\tSustainable Stitch\tRight now, I’m deeply motivated by the tangible impact Sustainable Stitch is creating—both environmentally and socially.

At the same time, GBV survivors and marginalized women face limited economic opportunities, struggling to achieve financial independence. This gap between waste and unemployment creates an opportunity for sustainable, income-generating solutions. How We Identified the Problem •    While working closely with marginalized communities and women-led initiatives, we saw two critical issues: Women, especially GBV survivors, lacked stable income despite having valuable sewing skills. Tons of fabric waste from manufacturers and households ended up in landfills, worsening environmental pollution. By combining these challenges, we realized that upcycling textile waste into marketable products could reduce waste, empower women, and create a circular economy. This led to the creation of Sustainable Stitch—a solution that transforms discarded fabrics into sustainable tote bags while ensuring fair wages and financial stability for women.\tSustainable Stitch – A Circular Solution for Waste & Economic Empowerment: Sustainable Stitch is a social enterprise that tackles textile waste and economic marginalization by repurposing unwanted fabrics and tetra packs into unique, sustainable tote bags. We provide GBV survivors and marginalized women from Lebanon & Syria with skills training, fair wages, and stable income opportunities, empowering them to become financially independent.  Our Solution - Upcycling Textile Waste: We collect discarded fabrics and tetra packs, transforming them into handmade, durable tote bags, reducing landfill waste. Women’s Economic Empowerment: We train and employ GBV survivors & vulnerable women in sewing, upcycling, and business skills, ensuring fair trade wages. - Sustainable & Ethical Production: Our process follows zero-waste, ethical labor, and circular economy principles, promoting environmental and social sustainability. - Community-Led Recycling Initiatives: We organize workshops in rural Chouf, engaging women and youth in sorting & repurposing textile waste into curtains, rugs, and pillow stuffing.

This will reduce our reliance on expensive fertilizers and the associated costs of plowing, fertilization, and time consumption. Seed Fermentation: Due to their high sugar content, seeds will undergo a specific fermentation process to create a natural fermentation enhancer. This further reduces our reliance on external inputs and ensures organic compost rich in beneficial minerals, especially nitrogen. Sustainable Practices: GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) and IPM (Integrated Pest Management): Implementing these practices will lead to the construction of a Phytosanitary Program (PSP), promoting sustainable and environmentally friendly farming methods. Full Agricultural Cycle: By adopting these measures, we initiate a complete agricultural cycle for the site, minimizing waste, maximizing resource utilization, and promoting sustainable practices. Educational Platform: Murex Farms will serve as a platform for training Lebanese students, providing opportunities for them to develop their master's or PhD thesis on an annual basis. Improving Gender Awareness and Youth Inclusion: Job Opportunities: Murex Farms will offer new job opportunities for recently graduated students, covering various disciplines such as agricultural engineering and food chemistry.

Syria has given us a lot and is like a mother who gave everything she could to her children even when we did not meet her with the same giving, today Syria is bleeding and since childhood I have dedicated myself to protecting this country and that the method and plan differ according to my age and mental abilities in each period, but the goal is clear.  At a time when war, global interests and sectarian strife are dividing the country, someone must gather the crumbs of what is left of the country before it turns to ashes to rebuild Syria again, and this is what I aim to do I have already taken simple but important steps in serving my country and my people through many of the actions that I have taken, perhaps the most prominent of which is my volunteering with Caritas for two years as ECL in a school for Syrians and helping and protecting them.  Influence needs strength, and strength needs knowledge, and perhaps my dreams in better Syria that what  still pushes me strongly on the academic and psychological level as well, and helping me to overcome these difficult days.

In workplaces, employees burned out under relentless pressure. In communities, people searched for stability amid the shifting landscape. Even wellness programs, meant to offer relief, often felt disconnected—imported solutions that failed to acknowledge the intersection of personal struggles, cultural realities, and systemic challenges. As we discussed potential solutions, and scrolled through wellness initiatives online, we couldn’t shake some questions: Why weren’t these programs working? Why did so many people attend mental health workshops only to feel just as stressed days later? Why did companies invest in wellness programs that employees barely engaged with? The answer became clear—wellness wasn’t just an individual pursuit. It had to be embedded into the way people lived, worked, and connected. It had to be accessible, culturally relevant, and deeply rooted in the realities of those it aimed to serve.\tEmBody—a model that doesn’t just teach wellness but integrates it into real-world contexts.

Additionally, social, and cultural theater to foster community engagement and creativity.  Another core aspect of the camp is the production of organic compost through the composting of organic waste. To encourage sustainable waste practices, we require organic waste to be delivered in reusable containers rather than plastic bags. In return, we provide compost to individuals, motivating them to adopt eco-friendly habits by using containers instead of disposable bags.  Beyond its practical applications, the camp will also serve as an educational platform.

E-waste contains toxic materials like lead, mercury, and cadmium that, when dumped in landfills or incinerated, release harmful greenhouse gases and pollutants, contaminating air, soil, and water.  I first identified this problem while working in both the engineering and education fields. In civil engineering, I observed the environmental degradation caused by unregulated waste disposal sites, often littered with discarded electronics. Later, as a robotics trainer and digital marketing facilitator, I noticed how quickly technology becomes obsolete, leading to a surge in discarded devices with little public awareness about their environmental impact.  What stood out was the lack of proper e-waste recycling facilities and the absence of public education on responsible disposal. Communities often resort to throwing old electronics into regular waste streams, unaware of the long-term environmental and climate consequences.  This realization sparked the idea for an e-waste recycling project that not only addresses the disposal issue but also focuses on climate action—reducing emissions, promoting recycling, and educating communities on sustainable practices.\tE-waste is one of the fastest-growing waste streams, contributing significantly to environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions when improperly disposed of. In many communities, there is limited access to responsible recycling options, leading to electronics ending up in landfills, where toxic components harm the environment and contribute to climate change. our solution: E-waste Collection & Recycling: We set up accessible collection points where individuals and businesses can safely dispose of old electronics. Collected e-waste is sorted, and valuable materials like metals and plastics are extracted and reintroduced into the manufacturing cycle, reducing the need for raw material extraction and lowering carbon emissions.\tNo\t..\tBloom Social Media\t..\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tYes\t7, #ERROR!\t7\t4\tIt was a great experience and a real step on the path to leadership.\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nTazwedco in ACSI4\tMohammed Bikdash\tmohammedbikdashq@gmail.com\tTazwedco\tPersonally: I am motivated by my vision to make a real impact in the e-commerce and supply sector, where I strive to develop innovative solutions that streamline business operations and enhance efficiency between suppliers and store owners.

This gap makes it difficult for women to focus on their own personal or professional goals, as they struggle to find reliable childcare for their children.  Many communities also suffer from a shortage of after-school childcare options that offer a secure environment for children, focusing on their overall development, well-being, and academic growth. The lack of quality childcare limits children's access to vital support and restricts parents, particularly women, from pursuing work or personal activities.  How I Identified It: This issue was identified through primary data and reports shared in Jordan, as well as my personal experience as a mother and observations within Women’s Networks. Key statistics include:  In Jordan, the labor force participation rate for women is just 14%, compared to 62.8% for men in 2023 (World Bank Gender Data). In 2018, more men than women owned businesses (World Bank Gender Data). Investing in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) in Jordan offers significant benefits, such as increasing educational attainment by 0.7 years, lifetime earnings by $23,113, and life expectancy by one year. Additionally, the societal benefits of ECCE investments outweigh costs by a ratio of 9:1, with the potential to create 30,000 jobs, mostly for women, in the ECCE sector (QRF Report on ECCE Investment).      \tStartup-Overview  Evening Stars Child Center is dedicated to fostering children’s academic success, emotional well-being, and overall development, providing a safe and nurturing environment for children aged 3-14. The center offers after-school programs and academic support to enhance children’s learning and personal growth. At the same time, it empowers mothers by offering flexible childcare services, allowing them the space they need to pursue personal and professional goals. This flexibility helps mothers balance their work and life responsibilities, knowing their children are in a supportive space that nurtures their academic, emotional, and social development. By operating as an evening center, it caters to both children and working mothers, ensuring sustainable growth for the entire family. In addition, the center offers community events and training sessions for caregivers, fostering a supportive environment for both families and staff. Social media will also play a vital role in promoting the center’s activities and engaging the community.  How It Works: Safe, secure, and engaging environment for children aged 3-14 during after-school and evening hours. After-school care, tutoring, and programs focused on academic growth, emotional well-being, and personal development. Providing holistic support for children’s development during the critical evening hours. Flexible childcare hours from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm, allowing mothers to balance career and personal goals. Empowering mothers to pursue work, education, or other activities with peace of mind, knowing their children are in a safe and supportive environment. Awareness events for the community on topics such as child development, parenting, and women’s empowerment, creating a stronger, more informed community around the center.

Have started developing my idea\t3\tYes\tDeclining\tNo\tYes\thttps://www.facebook.com/landscapinglebanon?mibextid=ZbWKwL\tNA\tProblem: Lebanon faces major challenges in sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and environmental conservation. Traditional farming methods often lead to soil depletion, water scarcity, and reduced biodiversity. Meanwhile, tourism development frequently ignores sustainability, leading to excessive resource consumption and environmental degradation. There is a need for a model that integrates regenerative agriculture, responsible tourism, and eco-conscious land use.  How I Identified It: Owning land in Batroun with 80 olive trees, I saw an opportunity to transform it into a self-sustaining ecosystem while addressing food security and environmental concerns. With over 20 years of experience in planting trees and landscaping, I recognized the potential of avocados and Palestinian pistachios to diversify crops while maintaining soil health. Additionally, my 10+ years in hospitality and management highlighted the growing demand for eco-tourism experiences that respect nature. By combining sustainable farming with eco-friendly guesthouses, I aim to offer a holistic, sustainable, and economically viable solution that benefits both the land and the community.\tMy startup is a sustainable agro-tourism project in Batroun, Lebanon, combining regenerative farming with eco-friendly hospitality. The land, home to 80 olive trees, will be expanded with avocado orchards and grafted Palestinian pistachios, promoting biodiversity and soil regeneration. Alongside sustainable agriculture, I plan to develop eco-conscious guesthouses, offering visitors an immersive experience in nature, organic food, and responsible tourism.  Solution: My project addresses two major challenges:  1. Sustainable Agriculture & Food Security  Implementing water-efficient irrigation, organic composting, and regenerative farming to increase yield and soil fertility.  Diversifying crops with avocados and Palestinian pistachios to enhance resilience to climate change and boost local food production.    2. Eco-Tourism & Sustainable Hospitality  Building guesthouses with eco-friendly materials and renewable energy sources (e.g., solar power, rainwater harvesting). Promoting farm-to-table experiences, reducing food waste by 30% and supporting local farmers/artisans.  Creating 5–10 sustainable jobs in farming, hospitality, and tourism within the first three years.   By integrating sustainable agriculture and responsible tourism, my startup will preserve Lebanon’s natural resources, empower the local community, and promote environmental awareness.\tNo\tNA\tBloom Newsletter\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tdara@bloom.pm\tYes\t6, #ERROR!\t6\t4\ti like to celebrate Abir Chamandy, i really admire what she is doing not everyone has it in them but she definitely is unique.\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nEco Mosaic in ACSI4\tMirna Mohamd Adnan Al Dada\tmirnamosaic@gmail.com\tEco Mosaic\tI am an Artist, I Do awareness sessions , and work shop regarding everything that has to do with recycling and upcycling material, also we use resin\tI am the owner and the leader of the team, and it is all about motivation and sustainability\tI don't have one\tFemale\t40+\tLebanon\tLebanon\t96171474277\t2025-02-05\tLebanon\tYes\tDesign\tSDG GOAL 12: Responsible Consumption and Production:::SDG GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:::SDG GOAL 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth:::SDG GOAL 15: Life on Land\tWell in recycling we use approximately  1 tom of plastic a year in recycling which saves between 2 to 3 toms of CO2 emissions l, which also leads to approximately 30% less in the use of energy\tTech & Innovation:::Education & life long learning:::Entrepreneurship\t\"2.1.

Our solution transforms discarded tires into eco-friendly furniture, construction materials, rubberized pavement, and fashion accessories, reducing landfill waste and CO₂ emissions. By leveraging innovative processing techniques and circular economy principles, we aim to repurpose at least 80% of collected tires while creating green job opportunities. This approach aligns with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), promoting environmental sustainability and economic growth.\tNo\tn/a\tWord of Mouth\tI believe that innovation and sustainability go hand in hand, and my project is a step toward a zero-waste future.

As a result, farmers were forced to discard large quantities of their harvest. This raised a critical question in my mind: How can we make use of this wasted produce To explore a solution, I partnered with a local fresh juice producer, providing him with a batch of apples for juicing. That’s when I noticed the significant amount of pomace left behind. This wasn’t just an issue with apples it was happening across the entire food processing chain with different products. Tons of organic byproducts were being discarded, while livestock farmers are facing rising feed costs. Seeing this gap, I decided to take action. I started reaching out to food processors, collecting their organic waste, and formulating it into a nutritious, sustainable livestock feed mix.\tDr. Feed is all about turning food and agricultural waste into valuable livestock feed, creating a sustainable and affordable solution for farmers. The challenge we’re solving comes in two forms: high-moisture waste, which is difficult to store and spoils quickly, and low-moisture waste, which can be repurposed more easily. For high-moisture waste, we developed an innovative machine that can pack 500 kg of waste per hour, keeping it fresh and usable without high costs. For low-moisture waste, we created a system that formulates it into a full, balanced feed mix, helping farmers lower their costs while maintaining high-quality nutrition for their livestock.\tYes\tAgrytech\tBloom Social Media\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tdara@bloom.pm\tYes\t6\t6\t3\t\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nBee lal in ACSI4\tBilal abdelraouf othman\tothman.bilal@hotmail.com\tBee lal\tPersonally & Professionally Motivated By: \"I am driven by my goal of expanding and developing my beekeeping business, as it continues to grow.

The moisture content in honey varies based on climate conditions and the  floral sources of nectar. Lebanon’s hot and humid summer, along with its moderate yet humid  winter, creates an environment that significantly increases honey's moisture levels. According to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (an international body established by the FAO  and WHO, World Health Organization), the acceptable maximum moisture content for honey is  19%. Exceeding this threshold compromises the quality of honey and leads to: • Fermentation and spoilage • Altered texture and reduced viscosity. • Diminished health benefits. • Negative impacts on taste and aroma. These changes compromise the quality of honey\thoney dehydration machine. Reducing Moisture Content The machine lowers water content to acceptable levels (below 19%), preventing  fermentation and spoilage. 2. Maintaining Nutritional Value By reducing the risk of bacterial or fungal activity, the machine ensures honey retains its  natural enzymes and vitamins. 3. Improving Texture and Density Controlled moisture levels enhance the density and texture, making honey more  appealing to consumers. 4. Ensuring Export Compliance Many international markets have stringent standards for honey moisture content. This  machine guarantees compliance, facilitating access to global markets. 5. Preserving Flavor and Color Proper moisture control maintains honey’s natural flavor and color, enhancing its overall  quality.\tYes\tgil program training\tOther\tthank u😁\tApplied to ACSI4,Selected to ACSI4 Bootcamp\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tYes\t5\t7\t3\t\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants,ACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Selected for Bootcamp\nGreen Fodder in ACSI4\tAyoub Chami Nasr\tayoubchami.ns@gmail.com\tGreen Fodder\tMy motivation is launching ventures that matter.

This project aims to:   Promote Sustainable Agriculture (SDG 2 & 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production): - Reduce water consumption for fodder production by 80% compared to conventional methods, addressing water scarcity challenges. - Decrease land usage for fodder cultivation by 50% by utilizing vertical or controlled environment growing systems. - Minimize or eliminate the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, resulting in a 95% reduction in agricultural chemical runoff.  Improve Economic Well-being (SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth): - Increase farmer profitability by 30% through increased livestock productivity.    Improve Livestock Health (SDG 3-Good Health and Well-being): - Reduce livestock disease related losses by 30% by providing them with high quality and consistent nutrition. - Increase the nutrition value of the fodder by 40%  compared to traditional fodder.   Climate Action (SDG 13): - Reduce the carbon footprint of livestock feed production by 3p% by reducing the transportation of feed, and reducing the use of farm equipment used to harvest traditional feed.  These quantified metrics, tracked over time, will demonstrate the project's impact on food security, environmental sustainability, and economic development.
