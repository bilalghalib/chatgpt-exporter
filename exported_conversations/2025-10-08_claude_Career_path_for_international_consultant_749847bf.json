  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is a multicultural consultant living in Lille, France, with a young child, who works at the intersection of education, entrepreneurship, and international development. They have a Masters in Education and are pursuing a new Masters in Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College online. Their professional background includes consulting work with the UN's ITC in Iraq (ending October 2025), co-founding Bloom.pm (a Lebanese nonprofit focused on entrepreneurship training that recently concluded), and previous roles with organizations like UNICEF, Autodesk, and various NGOs. They are fluent in Arabic and English with basic French skills.\n\nThe user requested Claude to create a professional profile assessment and evaluate whether a UNESCO Bangkok consultant position would be a good fit given their circumstances. Claude analyzed their background as someone who specializes in \"bridge-building in fragmented landscapes\" - creating educational frameworks and interventions in complex environments like conflict zones and refugee settings. The UNESCO role was a 50-day remote contract from October 2025 to January 2026, focusing on Global Citizenship Education (GCED) network support, valued at $22,500.\n\nWhen the user clarified that their ITC work was ending and they needed the income, they specifically asked for concrete help improving their application, particularly the workplan and materials selection. Claude provided detailed feedback identifying critical issues with their timeline compression and bureaucratic review cycles. The main problem was cramming 15 days of deliverables into 12 calendar days without accounting for UNESCO's feedback processes. Claude restructured their workplan into five phases with proper buffer time, proposed an immediate contract start, and provided specific guidance on six required submission components: employment history, CV updates, a tightened cover letter, past work samples (which were missing), a technical proposal with methodology section, and financial proposal formatting. The user demonstrated a preference for direct, constructive criticism over flattery and appreciated technical, actionable advice with clear metaphors to explain complex concepts.",

I bring fifteen years of designing and delivering learning programmes that combine 21st-century skills, values-based citizenship, and trauma-informed pedagogy, with a track record of producing clear, actionable knowledge products for international audiences.\nAt Bloom, the venture learning platform I co-founded, I have led pedagogy, research, and partnerships across Africa and SWANA, building collaborative networks and assessment tools that elevate both learning outcomes and well-being. My recent UN assignment with the International Trade Centre focused on co-developing a competency-based, culturally grounded curriculum with 50+ stakeholders, and producing documentation, slide decks, trainer guides, and reports suitable for publication and handover. Across these roles, I’ve routinely delivered concept notes, run-of-show agendas, presentations, web articles, and concise analytical briefs that synthesize evidence, surface lessons learned, and convert strategy into implementable steps.\nFor UNESCO Bangkok’s Transformative Education programme, I would contribute:\nGCED network content & communications: Develop member-led webinar concepts, agendas, facilitation plans, and communications packages; draft short announcement and follow-up articles (≤250 words) that amplify key messages, highlight country cases, and ensure gender responsiveness and inclusion.\n\n\nAnnual meetings (with APCEIU): Prepare concept notes, meeting packages, and decks showcasing network activities, 21st-century competencies, and the whole-school approach; document recommendations for engagement through year-end.\n\n\nAnalytical reporting: Craft succinct thematic and annual report inputs (≤7 pages + annexes) capturing insights, progress, challenges, and opportunities; propose practical follow-up actions and strengthened GCED–NEQMAP synergies in assessment and pedagogy.\n\n\n2026 proposal package: Translate 2025 reflections into clear priorities, a communications strategy, and a time-bound, measurable workplan aligned with the 2023 Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights, and Sustainable Development.\n\n\nMy approach is evidence-informed and whole-institution, shaped by experience working across ministries, NGOs, educators, youth, and community leaders.

The financial instability adds pressure, making this $22,500 contract potentially transformative. Their diverse skill set in organizational development, education, and cross-cultural work positions them as a strong candidate.\n\nHowever, challenges emerge. Balancing a 2-year-old, an online masters, a Lebanese nonprofit, and international consulting requires superhuman logistics. The Bangkok hours (UTC+7) might conflict with their current life in Lille, France, especially with childcare considerations.Looking at your materials and situation, let me sketch out your professional profile and then give you some honest pushback on this UNESCO opportunity.\n\n## Your Profile\n\nYou're essentially operating as a **bridge-builder in fragmented landscapes**—think of yourself as someone who works at the intersection of conflict zones, education innovation, and wellbeing research. Your superpower is creating learning frameworks that work in contexts where institutional structures are weak or broken. You've spent 15 years figuring out how to make entrepreneurship training, maker movements, and citizenship education actually function in places like Iraq, Lebanon, and refugee camps—not in theory, but in practice.\n\nYour trajectory shows someone who:\n- **Thrives in complexity**: You're comfortable with remote coordination, multicultural teams, crisis environments\n- **Creates systemic interventions**: Not just programs, but assessment frameworks, curriculum design, network building\n- **Documents and translates**: You convert messy field experience into polished reports, proposals, and presentations\n- **Juggles multiple identities**: Academic researcher + practitioner + nonprofit founder + consultant\n\n**Given your current constraints** (2-year-old, Lille-based, financial instability, multiple commitments), you need work that is:\n1. Remote-first with flexible hours\n2. Well-compensated per day of actual work\n3. Discrete projects with clear deliverables (not ongoing management)\n4. Aligned with your expertise so you're not learning from scratch\n\n## About This UNESCO Job\n\n**The Good:**\n- It's genuinely aligned with your experience—you've literally done all these tasks before\n- Home-based/remote is perfect for your situation\n- 50 days over 3.5 months gives you flexibility to manage other commitments\n- $22,500 for 50 days is decent (though not exceptional for consultancy)\n- Bangkok timezone (UTC+7) is only 5-6 hours ahead of Lille—doable for meetings\n- Short-term contract aligns with your need for discrete projects\n\n**The Concerning:**\n- **The deadline is TODAY** (Oct 8, 2025). If you haven't submitted yet, you're likely too late\n- The timeline is aggressive—deliverable 1.1 due in 10 days if contract starts mid-October\n- You'd be juggling this with: ITC Iraq work (ends Oct 2025), Bloom operations, new Cambridge masters starting, and parenting a 2-year-old\n- 50 days of work compressed into 3.5 months = ~14 days/month = you'd be working 2-3 weeks per month on this alone\n- Bangkok working hours mean potential evening calls from Lille (3pm Bangkok = 10am Lille, not terrible, but 5pm Bangkok = noon Lille)\n\n**Here's my actual pushback**: Your application materials are strong, but your **workplan timeline looks unrealistic**. You have 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 all due within the first 2 weeks (15 days of deliverables in 12 calendar days). Either you:\n- Front-load the work heavily (bad with a toddler)\n- Assume you'll start working before the contract officially begins\n- Haven't accounted for revision cycles\n\nAlso, at $450/day, this isn't *cheap* labor, but it's not premium consultancy rates either—you're in the mid-range. Given your expertise and the coordination complexity, you could arguably charge $600-750/day for similar work with private sector or foundations.\n\n## Better-Fit Job Archetypes for You\n\nBased on your profile, here's what would actually serve you well right now:\n\n1. **Evaluation/research consultancies** for INGO programs (remote, discrete, well-paid)\n2. **Curriculum design sprints** (2-4 week intensive projects you can plan around)\n3. **Strategy facilitation** for organizations working in your regions (Middle East, North Africa)\n4. **Academic research contracts** that feed both your Cambridge studies and income\n5. **Part-time remote roles** with EdTech or impact-focused organizations (stable income, flexible hours)\n\nThe UNESCO job fits the mold, but the timing and intensity might stretch you thin. If you got this contract, you'd essentially be working full-time across ITC + UNESCO + Bloom + new masters + parenting through November.\n\n**Real talk**: If the deadline hasn't passed and you can submit today, go for it—but negotiate the timeline in your technical proposal. Push deliverable 1.3 to early November, or propose a more gradual ramp-up. And if you don't get it, don't sweat it—there will be other UN/INGO consultancies that fit your profile with better timing.\n\nDoes this line up with how you're thinking about it? And did you manage to submit before the deadline?",

      "content": "Okay, so the situation is clearer:\n- ITC work ends this week (we're at Oct 8, 2025)\n- Bloom is done (not clear if completely shut down or just he's stepping back, but either way, not a time commitment)\n- He needs the income\n- He wants concrete help improving the application, particularly the workplan\n- He needs to know what materials to submit\n\nLet me think about this critically:\n\n1. **Timeline issues in his current workplan**: He's right that it's compressed. Let me look at what he has:\n   - 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 all in October (15 days of work)\n   - If contract starts \"mid-October\" that could mean Oct 15-20\n   - He has deliverable 1.1 due Oct 18 (that's potentially 3 days from contract start)\n   - This is unrealistic\n\n2. **What the ToR actually says**:\n   - Timeline says \"From: Mid of October-2025 To End of January-2026 (tentative)\"\n   - 3.1 says \"October 2025\" for webinars\n   - 3.2 says \"November 2025\" for annual meetings \"to be held before 5 December 2025\"\n   - So there IS urgency for the October stuff\n\n3. **How to fix the workplan**:\n   - He needs to show he can hit the October deadlines while being realistic\n   - Maybe propose starting immediately upon contract signature\n   - Stagger the deliverables more reasonably\n   - Show interim checkpoints/review cycles\n   - Build in buffer time\n\n4. **Materials to submit**:\n   - The job posting is very clear about what they want\n   - He has most of it, but let me check what he should refine\n\n5. **His user preferences**:\n   - Wants constructive criticism and pushback\n   - Doesn't like being flattered\n   - Enjoys using metaphors to break down complex ideas\n   - Prefers technical approaches that are straightforward and practical\n\nI'll craft advice that's direct, uses clear metaphors, and provides concrete steps to improve his application and workplan. The key is to give him actionable insights that address the timeline challenges while showing he can meet the project's urgent October requirements.Alright, let's fix this application. Since you need the work and have the bandwidth, here's what needs sharpening:\n\n## Critical Issues with Your Current Workplan\n\nYour timeline treats the contract like a sprint when it should be a relay race. You've crammed 15 days of work into the first 12 calendar days, which signals either:\n- You don't understand the scope\n- You're desperate and overselling capacity\n- You haven't accounted for UNESCO review cycles\n\n**The real problem**: UNESCO bureaucracy moves slowly. You'll submit draft 1.1, wait 3-5 days for feedback, revise, wait again. Your current plan has no buffer for this.\n\n## Revised Workplan Strategy\n\n**Propose an immediate start** (upon contract signature, even if that's Oct 10-12). This shows urgency and gives you actual time to hit October deliverables. Restructure like this:\n\n```\nREVISED TIMELINE (assuming Oct 12 start)\n\nPhase 1: Member-Led Webinars (Oct 12-25)\n- Days 1-2: Kick-off call + desk review of past GCED webinars\n- Days 3-5: Draft 1.1 (concept, agenda, comms) → submit Oct 16\n- Days 6-7: Incorporate feedback + finalize 1.1 → Oct 18\n- Days 8-10: Draft 1.2 (announcements + country docs) → submit Oct 21\n- Day 11: Revisions → finalize Oct 25\n\nPhase 2: Annual Meetings Prep (Oct 21-Nov 8)\nOVERLAP with Phase 1 for efficiency\n- Days 12-16: Draft 1.3 (concept notes, agenda, ROS, deck, comms) → submit Oct 30\n- Days 17-19: Revisions + finalize 1.3 → Nov 5\n- Milestone: Materials ready 1 month before Dec 5 meetings\n\nPhase 3: Post-Meeting Deliverables (Nov 10-30)\n- Days 20-22: Draft 2.1 (web articles) → submit Nov 14\n- Days 23-29: Draft 2.2 (Annual Report inputs) → submit Nov 24\n- Day 30: Revisions → finalize Nov 30\n\nPhase 4: Synthesis & Analysis (Dec 1-20)\n- Days 31-37: Draft 3.1 (PowerPoint) + 3.2 (thematic report) → submit Dec 12\n- Days 38-40: Revisions → finalize Dec 20\n\nPhase 5: 2026 Planning (Jan 5-Feb 20)\n- Days 41-50: Draft 4.1 & 4.2 (proposal + evaluation) → submit Feb 6\n- Days 51-53: Revisions → finalize Feb 20\n```\n\n**Key improvements**:\n- Front-loads October work but builds in review cycles\n- Shows you understand UNESCO moves slowly\n- Gives them materials well before the Dec 5 deadline (not last-minute)\n- Phases 1-2 overlap intentionally (you're gathering intel for 1.3 while wrapping 1.1-1.2)\n\n## What to Include in Your Materials Package\n\n**1. Employment History Form** (you have this)\n- Looks complete, no changes needed\n\n**2. Updated CV** (you have this)\n- It's strong. Maybe add one line under ITC experience: \"Delivered final curriculum documentation suite October 2025, including trainer guides and implementation roadmap\"\n\n**3. Cover Letter** (needs tightening)\nYour current version is too long and buries the lede. Restructure:\n\n**Paragraph 1**: \"I bring X years doing exactly these tasks\" (you have this)\n\n**Paragraph 2**: Cut the Bloom/ITC description by 50%. They've seen your CV. Just write:\n> \"At Bloom (2016-2024), I built assessment frameworks and produced 100+ reports for diverse stakeholders. At ITC (2024-2025), I delivered curriculum documentation for 50+ stakeholders in Iraq, including concept notes, trainer guides, and visual presentations—all meeting international editorial standards and tight deadlines.\"\n\n**Paragraph 3**: Your bulleted list is good—keep it but make it punchier:\n> \"For UNESCO Bangkok, I would deliver:\n> - **Webinar packages**: concepts, agendas, facilitation plans, announcement articles (≤250 words)\n> - **Annual meeting materials**: slide decks, concept notes, run-of-show agendas highlighting GCED-NEQMAP synergies  \n> - **Analytical reports**: succinct inputs (≤7 pages) capturing insights, gender-responsive recommendations, and practical follow-up actions\n> - **2026 workplan**: evidence-based priorities aligned with the 2023 Recommendation on Education for Peace\"\n\n**Paragraph 4**: Keep the logistics paragraph (English/Arabic, remote, timezone)\n\n**Paragraph 5**: Close with availability—this is critical:\n> \"My current ITC contract concludes October 11, 2025, making me immediately available to begin upon contract signature. I've attached my technical proposal with a revised workplan showing early delivery of October materials.\"\n\n**4. Past Work Samples** (you wrote \"Example(in hyperlink)\" but didn't provide any)\n\n**This is a major gap.** You need 2-3 examples that mirror what they're asking for:\n\n**Must include**:\n- A short article (250-500 words) you've written for a website or report\n- A concept note or agenda for a workshop/meeting (2-3 pages)\n- A PowerPoint deck or visual presentation\n\n**Where to find these**:\n- Any Bloom program documentation\n- ITC curriculum concept notes or workshop agendas\n- Articles you've written for Nawaya, Medium, or other platforms\n\nIf you genuinely don't have shareable examples (confidentiality issues), create sanitized versions:\n- Take an ITC concept note, remove sensitive details, rename it \"Sample Workshop Concept Note - Youth Entrepreneurship Program\"\n- Pull 3 slides from a deck and label it \"Sample Presentation Excerpt\"\n\n**Format**: Create a simple doc that lists each sample with context:\n\n```\nPAST WORK SAMPLES\n\n1. Workshop Concept Note – Design Thinking for Refugee Youth (2017)\n   [PDF link or attached]\n   Context: UNICEF-funded program reaching 150+ youth.

Technical Proposal** (needs restructuring)\n\nYour current \"Approach & Methodology\" section is just a header with no content. Write 1.5-2 pages covering:\n\n**Section A: Understanding of the Assignment** (0.5 page)\nParaphrase the ToR to show you get it:\n> \"UNESCO Bangkok seeks to strengthen the Asia-Pacific GCED Network through high-quality knowledge products, communications materials, and strategic planning documents. The deliverables span four categories: (1) immediate webinar support, (2) annual meeting facilitation, (3) analytical synthesis, and (4) forward planning for 2026. Success requires balancing urgent October deadlines with substantive analysis of 2025 activities and GCED-NEQMAP synergies, all while maintaining gender-responsive and whole-school approach lenses.\"\n\n**Section B: Methodology** (1 page)\nExplain HOW you'll actually do this:\n\n> **Phase 1 - Discovery & Alignment**\n> Upon contract start, I will conduct desk review of 2024-2025 GCED Network materials and hold alignment calls with UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU to clarify priorities, gather templates, and confirm editorial preferences.

For visual materials (decks, agendas), I'll provide wireframes for early direction-setting before full development. For written pieces, I'll share outlines first to align on structure and key messages.\n\n> **Cross-Cutting Approaches**\n> - *Gender lens*: All materials will foreground examples of women and girls in GCED, use inclusive language, and highlight gender-disaggregated data where available\n> - *21st century skills bridge*: Explicit connections between GCED competencies and NEQMAP assessment frameworks in every deliverable\n> - *Evidence-informed*: Footnoted references to UNESCO publications, regional data, and network member experiences\n> - *Whole-school approach*: Materials will emphasize institutional integration beyond individual classrooms\n\n> **Quality Assurance**\n> All text deliverables will be copy-edited, referenced per UNESCO style guide, and delivered in both Word (for editing) and PDF formats. PowerPoint decks will include speaker notes. I will track all feedback in revision logs for transparency.\n\n**Section C: Workplan & Timeline** (0.5 page)\nInsert your revised table from above, preceded by 2 sentences:\n> \"The workplan below assumes contract signature by October 12, enabling immediate start. It front-loads October deliverables while building in UNESCO review cycles, ensuring materials are ready well before the December 5 annual meetings.\"\n\n**6. Financial Proposal** \n\nYour fee table is fine, but add a note at the bottom:\n\n```\nNotes:\n- Daily rate of $450 USD reflects mid-career consultancy benchmark for international \n  development education sector\n- Total fee covers all revisions and feedback incorporation (no additional charges)\n- Proposed lump sum contract: $22,500 USD payable in three installments \n  (33% upon contract signature, 33% upon delivery of Phase 3, 34% upon final acceptance)\n- If official travel required, DSA and economy airfare to be covered separately per UNESCO rules\n```\n\n## One More Thing: The Submission\n\nThe job post says to submit through the online portal, uploading everything as ONE Word document:\n> \"Before uploading the completed form, please add the following documents as extra pages at the end of the Word file\"\n\nSo your final submission is:\n1.

Let me look at what he has:\n   - 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 all in October (15 days of work)\n   - If contract starts \"mid-October\" that could mean Oct 15-20\n   - He has deliverable 1.1 due Oct 18 (that's potentially 3 days from contract start)\n   - This is unrealistic\n\n2. **What the ToR actually says**:\n   - Timeline says \"From: Mid of October-2025 To End of January-2026 (tentative)\"\n   - 3.1 says \"October 2025\" for webinars\n   - 3.2 says \"November 2025\" for annual meetings \"to be held before 5 December 2025\"\n   - So there IS urgency for the October stuff\n\n3. **How to fix the workplan**:\n   - He needs to show he can hit the October deadlines while being realistic\n   - Maybe propose starting immediately upon contract signature\n   - Stagger the deliverables more reasonably\n   - Show interim checkpoints/review cycles\n   - Build in buffer time\n\n4. **Materials to submit**:\n   - The job posting is very clear about what they want\n   - He has most of it, but let me check what he should refine\n\n5. **His user preferences**:\n   - Wants constructive criticism and pushback\n   - Doesn't like being flattered\n   - Enjoys using metaphors to break down complex ideas\n   - Prefers technical approaches that are straightforward and practical\n\nI'll craft advice that's direct, uses clear metaphors, and provides concrete steps to improve his application and workplan. The key is to give him actionable insights that address the timeline challenges while showing he can meet the project's urgent October requirements.",

            "text": "Alright, let's fix this application. Since you need the work and have the bandwidth, here's what needs sharpening:\n\n## Critical Issues with Your Current Workplan\n\nYour timeline treats the contract like a sprint when it should be a relay race. You've crammed 15 days of work into the first 12 calendar days, which signals either:\n- You don't understand the scope\n- You're desperate and overselling capacity\n- You haven't accounted for UNESCO review cycles\n\n**The real problem**: UNESCO bureaucracy moves slowly. You'll submit draft 1.1, wait 3-5 days for feedback, revise, wait again. Your current plan has no buffer for this.\n\n## Revised Workplan Strategy\n\n**Propose an immediate start** (upon contract signature, even if that's Oct 10-12). This shows urgency and gives you actual time to hit October deliverables. Restructure like this:\n\n```\nREVISED TIMELINE (assuming Oct 12 start)\n\nPhase 1: Member-Led Webinars (Oct 12-25)\n- Days 1-2: Kick-off call + desk review of past GCED webinars\n- Days 3-5: Draft 1.1 (concept, agenda, comms) → submit Oct 16\n- Days 6-7: Incorporate feedback + finalize 1.1 → Oct 18\n- Days 8-10: Draft 1.2 (announcements + country docs) → submit Oct 21\n- Day 11: Revisions → finalize Oct 25\n\nPhase 2: Annual Meetings Prep (Oct 21-Nov 8)\nOVERLAP with Phase 1 for efficiency\n- Days 12-16: Draft 1.3 (concept notes, agenda, ROS, deck, comms) → submit Oct 30\n- Days 17-19: Revisions + finalize 1.3 → Nov 5\n- Milestone: Materials ready 1 month before Dec 5 meetings\n\nPhase 3: Post-Meeting Deliverables (Nov 10-30)\n- Days 20-22: Draft 2.1 (web articles) → submit Nov 14\n- Days 23-29: Draft 2.2 (Annual Report inputs) → submit Nov 24\n- Day 30: Revisions → finalize Nov 30\n\nPhase 4: Synthesis & Analysis (Dec 1-20)\n- Days 31-37: Draft 3.1 (PowerPoint) + 3.2 (thematic report) → submit Dec 12\n- Days 38-40: Revisions → finalize Dec 20\n\nPhase 5: 2026 Planning (Jan 5-Feb 20)\n- Days 41-50: Draft 4.1 & 4.2 (proposal + evaluation) → submit Feb 6\n- Days 51-53: Revisions → finalize Feb 20\n```\n\n**Key improvements**:\n- Front-loads October work but builds in review cycles\n- Shows you understand UNESCO moves slowly\n- Gives them materials well before the Dec 5 deadline (not last-minute)\n- Phases 1-2 overlap intentionally (you're gathering intel for 1.3 while wrapping 1.1-1.2)\n\n## What to Include in Your Materials Package\n\n**1. Employment History Form** (you have this)\n- Looks complete, no changes needed\n\n**2. Updated CV** (you have this)\n- It's strong. Maybe add one line under ITC experience: \"Delivered final curriculum documentation suite October 2025, including trainer guides and implementation roadmap\"\n\n**3. Cover Letter** (needs tightening)\nYour current version is too long and buries the lede. Restructure:\n\n**Paragraph 1**: \"I bring X years doing exactly these tasks\" (you have this)\n\n**Paragraph 2**: Cut the Bloom/ITC description by 50%. They've seen your CV. Just write:\n> \"At Bloom (2016-2024), I built assessment frameworks and produced 100+ reports for diverse stakeholders. At ITC (2024-2025), I delivered curriculum documentation for 50+ stakeholders in Iraq, including concept notes, trainer guides, and visual presentations—all meeting international editorial standards and tight deadlines.\"\n\n**Paragraph 3**: Your bulleted list is good—keep it but make it punchier:\n> \"For UNESCO Bangkok, I would deliver:\n> - **Webinar packages**: concepts, agendas, facilitation plans, announcement articles (≤250 words)\n> - **Annual meeting materials**: slide decks, concept notes, run-of-show agendas highlighting GCED-NEQMAP synergies  \n> - **Analytical reports**: succinct inputs (≤7 pages) capturing insights, gender-responsive recommendations, and practical follow-up actions\n> - **2026 workplan**: evidence-based priorities aligned with the 2023 Recommendation on Education for Peace\"\n\n**Paragraph 4**: Keep the logistics paragraph (English/Arabic, remote, timezone)\n\n**Paragraph 5**: Close with availability—this is critical:\n> \"My current ITC contract concludes October 11, 2025, making me immediately available to begin upon contract signature. I've attached my technical proposal with a revised workplan showing early delivery of October materials.\"\n\n**4. Past Work Samples** (you wrote \"Example(in hyperlink)\" but didn't provide any)\n\n**This is a major gap.** You need 2-3 examples that mirror what they're asking for:\n\n**Must include**:\n- A short article (250-500 words) you've written for a website or report\n- A concept note or agenda for a workshop/meeting (2-3 pages)\n- A PowerPoint deck or visual presentation\n\n**Where to find these**:\n- Any Bloom program documentation\n- ITC curriculum concept notes or workshop agendas\n- Articles you've written for Nawaya, Medium, or other platforms\n\nIf you genuinely don't have shareable examples (confidentiality issues), create sanitized versions:\n- Take an ITC concept note, remove sensitive details, rename it \"Sample Workshop Concept Note - Youth Entrepreneurship Program\"\n- Pull 3 slides from a deck and label it \"Sample Presentation Excerpt\"\n\n**Format**: Create a simple doc that lists each sample with context:\n\n```\nPAST WORK SAMPLES\n\n1. Workshop Concept Note – Design Thinking for Refugee Youth (2017)\n   [PDF link or attached]\n   Context: UNICEF-funded program reaching 150+ youth. I developed the conceptual framework, \n   agenda, and communications materials.
