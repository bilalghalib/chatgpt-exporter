It’s felt.**\n\n---\n\n**Facilitator Notes:**\n\n- **(2-3 minutes) Slide 1:** Encourage participants to move beyond generic, aspirational language. Prompt them to ask, *\"Would our customers miss us?\"* Discuss briefly how clearly articulated values translate directly into meaningful customer experiences and deeper connections.\n\n- **(3-4 minutes) Slide 2:** Quickly review examples. Emphasize why superficial \"values\" backfire and discuss how authenticity builds lasting trust and aligns you with the right customers and investors.\n\n- **(3-4 minutes) Slide 3 (McDonald's Case):** Emphasize how businesses can’t just superficially add “green” or “ethical” labels. Discuss why McDonald’s “green” claims fail and what a genuinely aligned and authentic alternative might look like.\n\n- **Transition:** Guide participants toward developing genuine strategies that actively embody and express their values through their triple-bottom-line model.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Company Examples (if you need alternatives):**  \n- **Nestlé (Bottled Water):** Claims environmental stewardship while extracting groundwater unsustainably.\n- **Amazon (Labor Practices):** Values “customer obsession” but criticized for worker exploitation.\n- **Ben & Jerry’s (Positive example):** Activist brand genuinely committed to social justice, fair sourcing, and transparency.\n\nWould you like to integrate any of these additional examples or adjust the emphasis further?",

Highlight that genuine authenticity is not about marketing—it's about deeply embedded, consistent actions.\n\n- **Discussion Questions (2-3 minutes):**\n  - **\"Where have you personally seen companies misleading customers about their ethical or sustainable claims?\"**\n    - Possible examples to guide conversation if participants are shy:\n      - Products with nature-themed packaging but minimal environmental consideration.\n      - Brands promoting themselves as \"clean\" or \"renewable\" while relying on destructive extraction (fracking companies labeling themselves as \"clean energy\").\n      - Brands claiming ethical labor practices while lacking transparency about their supply chain conditions.\n\n- **Reflection & Deeper Dive (3-4 minutes):**\n  - **\"Given that customers increasingly demand authenticity, how do you clearly differentiate your company from those who only 'talk the talk'?\"**\n    - Encourage participants to identify concrete ways to demonstrate commitment:\n      - Implementing clearly documented and publicly accessible sustainability policies.\n      - Providing evidence-backed narratives (case studies, transparent reporting).\n      - Seeking and highlighting trusted certifications.\n\n- **Trainer Tips:**  \n  Emphasize the long-term benefits of authentic ethical practices—customer loyalty, deeper trust, better investment prospects, and resilience against reputation risks.\n\n---\n\nThis approach maintains coherence with the prior slides, solidifying the distinction between superficial \"values marketing\" and genuinely meaningful actions and strategies.",

Ethics aren’t just rules to follow—they represent your deeper 'why' and drive your business forward, especially in challenging times.\"\nDiscussion Questions (10 minutes):\nWhen someone says 'ethics,' what's the first thing that comes to your mind?\nHow can authenticity provide your business with unique advantages that competitors can't easily replicate?\nWhat impact does alignment with a founder's deepest values have on business success?\nCan you recall a moment when you felt genuinely alive and motivated by your work? How can that kind of energy enhance business performance?\nHave you seen examples where businesses succeeded specifically because they stayed true to their core values? What happened?\nWho are the stakeholders impacted by your business (customers, employees, local community, environment)? Why does considering their well-being contribute to your long-term success?\nEncourage participants to share real examples—situations where businesses either lost trust by cutting corners or built loyalty by sticking firmly to their values.\nAs the conversation progresses, highlight the two fundamental approaches to ethics:\nWrap-Up Points (2-3 minutes):\n\"We've talked about two main pathways businesses can take regarding ethics—Compliance-based and Values-based. Let's briefly explore each:\"\nCompliance-Based Ethics: Playing Safe\nDoing what's legally required—meeting regulations and avoiding penalties.\nPrimarily focused on avoiding problems and doing no harm.\nLimitations: Laws differ by location, and simply following rules doesn't create deeper connections with customers or employees.\nValues-Based Ethics: Igniting Purpose\nGoing beyond compliance because you have a meaningful purpose and clear core values.\nActing authentically, proactively, and ethically—even when nobody is watching—because your 'why' genuinely drives you.\nWillingness to put in extra effort aligned with your values, making your work more purposeful and fulfilling.\nWhy Values Ignite Your Business:\nCustomer Connection: People support businesses whose values align with theirs. Authenticity builds trust, loyalty, and lasting customer relationships.\nTeam Loyalty: Employees remain engaged and motivated when their work serves a meaningful purpose beyond financial compensation.\nLong-term Resilience: Businesses guided by strong, clear values can more effectively adapt to challenges and thrive amid uncertainty.\nCompetitive Edge: Authenticity differentiates your business clearly and powerfully in crowded markets.\nClosing Thought:\nWe aren't just building startups—we're cultivating purpose-driven businesses that attract customers, inspire communities, and stand the test of time. Ethics, grounded in authenticity and values, can become your a strategic advantage.\nAs Epictetus famously said:\n\"First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to.\"\n]]]\n\n\nOriginal text[[[\n15 minutes: Discussion\n\nHave a discussion around ethics. Some questions you might want to ask to encourage discussion include:\nCan someone tell me what they know about ethics?\nWhat do ethics look like in the business context? What are ethics in business? \nHow are business ethics and high ethical standards linked to business sustainability?\nWho are all of the people impacted by your business (stakeholders)? Why is it important to take care of them?\n\nSome of these points probably came up in the discussion. Maybe someone mentioned following the law as a part of ethics. Or not, so you can bring it up now. \nBasically, there are 2 types of ethics:\nCompliance based: This is doing the bare minimum. You follow the laws and do what you are supposed to do. The idea here is not to do any harm. However, sometimes the laws might not be perfect and still do harm. This is difficult because laws are different in different locations because of cultural differences. What might not be ethical in some cultures (child labor for instance), are perfectly accepted in other places in the world. \nDo no harm (hopefully)\nFollow laws\nFollow guidelines provided by an organization or group telling you what you can and can’t do. \nPenalties for violations\n\nValues based: Because laws aren’t perfect, they leave room for businesses to damage people, communities, and the environment. Based on personal choices and values (without disregarding logical business rationale), you can choose to have your business have a positive impact on society. It takes a bit of extra work, but your business will have an impact on so many people. Some people might argue that you have a moral duty to do good with your business. \nDo good. Do more than the minimum legal requirements and expectations to do what you think is right. \nCompany core values. Act with your company core values in mind.\nSelf regulation. Hold yourself accountable and do good even when nobody’s watching.\nExtra effort. Put in a little extra effort to be the best version of your business that can possibly exist. \n3\n\n5 Minutes: Discussion - Ethics: Living Values That Ignite Business Continued\nDiscussion Questions (2-3 minutes):\nWhat is your strong why? What “why” will keep you going when things are hard? What values and ethical ways of doing business will inspire you, help you find aligned funders, team members and customers? \n4\n\n3-5 minutes: Discussion:\n\nAsk: What do you think about this video?

Their internal data showed that 15% of growth came from brands that had a purpose. Therefore, they made a strategic decision to adjust their strategy to make sure that all of their brands have an activated brand purpose. \n“The cost of inaction is a lot more than taking action”- Jonathan Atwood VP of communications and sustainable living at Unlilever.\n\nShort discussion: Can you think of a business you interact with because you align with their values and purpose?\n6\n\nMcDonalds, Green and Healthy?\n3-5 minutes: Discuss\nIs McDonald's known to be a green and healthy restaurant?\nWhy did McDonalds go “green” in Europe?\nIs this an authentic display of McDonald’s core values?

How can you “activate” the purpose behind your business (instead of just having values that are never worked towards accomplishing)?]]]\n9\n\nWHO ARE YOUR STAKEHOLDERS?\u000b\nPEOPLE\nPLANET\nPROFIT\n2-3 minutes: Lecture\nAs a business, you will have an impact on so many different people just by existing.  You have an impact on your customers, your employees, the shareholders of your company, the communities you operate in, and the planet we live on. This impact could be positive or negative and it all depends on the choices you make as the leader of your company. Therefore, you should actively think through how your business decisions will impact all of your different stakeholders. \nWe will look at the triple bottom line business model to do this. When you think of a “bottom line”, traditionally that means a solely profit driven business (bottom line of a P&L), but there are businesses who are driven for other reasons as well (people driven companies, environmentally driven companies, etc…)\nOver the next few slides, spend time in each category to brainstorm things entrepreneurs can do right now or in the near future to be more ethical and ultimately, more sustainable in these 3 categories (representing the Triple Bottom Line model):\nPeople\nPlanet\nProfit\n\nTrainer tip: Over the next few slides, try to avoid answers such as “make donations” or “give away free products”. Those things are great, but try to get the entrepreneurs to think about how their core of their business’ existence can be rooted in uplifting the world. Donations and giveaways are great, but they aren’t sustainable on their own. We will discuss “good answers” on the next slides. These things can include using less plastic in packaging, having a transparent and fair hiring process, etc…).\n10\n\nPEOPLE\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nHave a discussion on ways to positively impact all the people who interact with your business or are impacted by it in some way.\nWrite all the answers on the board.\nAs people share answers, try to go deeper and show how these “ethical” actions actually have a positive impact on your business as well\nAsk: What are things that your business can do to have a positive impact on people? \nPotential answers:\nCommunity: \nEducational events and workshops related to your mission for community members, customers, employees, etc…\nPartnerships and collaborations with other businesses or organizations working towards the same mission\nHire from your local community. Job creation stimulates growth.\nHire vulnerable or marginalized people\nTackle social issues through company policy and actions\nEmployees:\nPay employees well\nGive employees benefits\nProvide education or personal development opportunities\nEnsure fair (or good) hours and working conditions\nCustomers:\nYour business should be solving a problem for them\nYour products should be safe and not cause any harm\nListen and respect them\n\nExamples you can give:\nChobani Yogurt has a policy to hire refugees which positively affects society \nStarbucks has a policy to hire veterans and refugees. They also have policies to prevent food waste and give food to people in need within their communities. \n\nTrainer tip: If entrepreneurs are having a hard time coming up with answers, consider asking “What are some ethical companies you know about? How do they treat their employees and community? What do they do that inspires you?\n11\n\nPROFIT\n5 minutes: Discussion\nIn the triple bottom line model, profits are important, but not always the driving force. At the end of the day, you have to remember that you have to make a profit. It is great to do good, but if you can’t sustain yourself your business won’t last. \nAsk: How can you actually implement some of those ideas from before while also keeping profitability in mind? \nPotential answers:\nConduct a cost benefit analysis on the ideas to see which owns are most “beneficial”\nOnly do things that you can afford to do\nFind other companies or organizations to donate to your cause and \nIntegrate ethics into your business model in a way that ethical behavior is always profitable!\nEtc…\n\nMore information on the examples you from the “People slide”:\nChobani Yogurt has a policy to hire refugees which positively affects society (this does not affect profits at all)\nStarbucks has a policy to hire veterans and refugees. They also have policies to prevent food waste and give food to people in need within their communities. (these decisions have actually had a positive effect on Starbucks profitability from the good publicity)\n\n12\n\nPLANET\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nHave a discussion on ways to positively impact all the environment and planet with your business.\nWrite all the answers on the board.\nAs people share answers, try to go deeper and show how these “ethical” actions actually have a positive impact on your business as well\nAsk: What are things that your business can do to have a positive impact on the planet? \nPotential answers:\nConsider circular business models that use a different way of producing and consuming goods to be more environmentally friendly and “circular” (in a way that mimics natures). This can include using recycled materials in production or incentivizing customers to return products to the company where it can be refurbished or reused in another way (circular model). Avoid extracting things from the earth, giving it to the customers, and putting it in a landfill (this is a linear model).\nRecycle when you can \nReduce consumption and try to conserve natural resources\nReuse when you can instead of creating more waste\nRepair old or broken materials instead of throwing them out\nDonate excess materials/goods instead of throwing them out\nStreamline processes and remove unnecessary steps\nThink of ways to have a better impact on water & air quality, \n\nTrainer tip: If entrepreneurs are having a hard time coming up with answers, consider asking “What are some ethical companies you know about? What do they do to positively impact the environment? What do they do that inspires you?\n\n13\n\nHIGH STANDARDS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nSo, how do companies that are genuinely doing good work stand out from the others?

Keep as is. |\n| 9:00 Settle in | Keep | Good introductory slide, practical and welcoming. |\n| 9:15 Begin the session | **Simplify slightly** | Keep brief greeting. Combine with objectives slide clearly. |\n| Objectives Slide | **Remove duplicates** | Consolidate repeated objectives to clear bullet points (as above). |\n| **Slide on Ethics Discussion (Slide #2 in your set)** | ✅ Keep (updated version) | Excellent clarity and depth. It frames values-based ethics clearly. |\n| Ethics Continued (\"Living Values\") (slide #3) | **Remove this slide** | Redundant after the earlier ethics discussion slide; integrate key questions into the first ethics slide. |\n| **Video Discussion Slide (Slide #4)** | **Keep, but ensure clarity** | Clearly state the name of the company/video discussed, or replace with a specific recognizable example (e.g., \"Dove Beauty\" campaign) if not stated clearly. |\n| **Unilever Strategy Slide (Slide #5)** | ✅ Keep. | Strong evidence-based example. Ensure tight link with previous Dove video. |\n| **McDonald’s Greenwashing Slide (Slide #6)** | ✅ Keep | Important case study directly aligning with the previous discussions. Clearly connects ethics and values activation. |\n| **\"FROM WORDS TO PURPOSE\" Slide (Slide #7)** | ✅ Keep this updated version | Excellent slide clearly bridging to action. Make sure facilitator notes clearly emphasize connecting stated values to authentic purpose-driven practices. |\n| **Company Examples Slide (Slide #8)** | ✅ Keep as illustrative and engaging | Powerful examples of authentic vs inauthentic practices. |\n| **Who Are Your Stakeholders Slide (Slide #9)** | ✅ Keep | Perfectly transitions into triple bottom line action. Just ensure clarity in the facilitator notes about transition from authenticity → stakeholders. |\n| **PEOPLE Slide (Slide #10)** | ✅ Keep | Good interactive and practical content. |\n| **PROFIT Slide (Slide #11)** | ✅ Keep | Clearly highlights balancing ethics with sustainable profits. |\n| **PLANET Slide (Slide #12)** | ✅ Keep | Engaging and practical discussion prompt. |\n| **HIGH STANDARDS slide (#13)** | 🚫 **REMOVE** (Duplicate) | Fully redundant with earlier slides (#7 and #8). Remove to streamline presentation flow. |\n| **RISE ABOVE VALUESWASHING slide (#15)** | 🚫 **REMOVE** (Duplicate)** | Already covered clearly in previous slides; integrate essential points into Slide #7 and #8 facilitator notes. |\n| **IMPACT ACTIVATION Slide** (currently slide before wrap-up, #18) | ✅ Keep and expand clearly | Important slide on measuring impact, align strongly with triple bottom line. |\n| Wrap up / Thank you | ✅ Keep simple and clear | Good to close the session clearly. |\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Final Flow:\n\n1. **Agenda Slide** *(Clear and simple)*\n2. **Welcome (Settle in, Objectives)**\n3. **What are Ethics?** (Values-based vs. Compliance-based ethics clearly articulated, 15-min deep interactive discussion)\n4. **Ethics continued:** Connecting ethics with your deep purpose/why *(quick follow-up discussion slide)*.\n5. **Case Study Video (e.g., Dove Campaign)** *(Clear example of powerful authenticity)*.\n6. **Unilever’s Strategic Emphasis** *(Purpose-driven brand activation evidence)*.\n7. **From Words to Purpose** *(Brief introduction connecting values clearly to real-world activation, transition clearly here)*.\n8. **Real vs Fake Examples** *(Company examples of genuine vs. superficial commitments, e.g., McDonald's)*.\n9. **Who Are Your Stakeholders (Intro to Triple Bottom Line)** *(Establish framework clearly)*.\n8. **Triple Bottom Line – PEOPLE** *(discussion slide, practical ideas)*.\n9. **Triple Bottom Line – PROFIT** *(practical balance)*.\n10. **Triple Bottom Line – PLANET** *(practical examples)*.\n11. **Impact Metrics & Activation** *(clear, actionable measurement tools, certifications, and reporting)*.\n12. **Wrap-Up / Thank You / Questions**\n\n---\n\n### Key Alignment Recommendations:\n\n- **Ethics → Authenticity → Practical Application → Measurement**:  \n  Clearly structure the workshop to move from foundational ethics through to activation and practical impact measurement.\n\n- **Simplify and Clarify**:  \n  Remove duplication (Slide #13 \"High Standards\" redundant; already covered by Slide #8).  \n  Clearly define and consolidate objectives.\n\n- **Transitions**:  \n  Ensure facilitator explicitly signals transitions between ethics, authentic values, greenwashing, and applying/measuring impact.\n\n---\n\n**Final Action Steps:**\n\n✅ **Slides to Remove**:  \n- \"HIGH STANDARDS\" slide (#13 duplicate)  \n- Any redundant objective slides  \n\n✅ **Clarify/merge**: Objectives slides (slides near the beginning).\n\n✅ **Enhance Transitions Clearly**:  \n- From Ethics → Authentic Values → Greenwashing → Triple Bottom Line → Impact Measurement clearly stated by facilitator.\n\n✅ **Keep & Strengthen**:\n- Case examples (Patagonia, Tony’s Chocolonely, Unilever).\n- From Words to Purpose slide (critical bridge).\n- Triple Bottom Line slides (People, Profit, Planet clearly separated but linked logically).\n\nThis simplified structure provides maximum clarity, avoids repetition, and delivers a coherent, engaging narrative that supports your core message of authentic ethical business practice and real impact measurement.",
