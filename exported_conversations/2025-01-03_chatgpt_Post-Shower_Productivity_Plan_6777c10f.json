There's also a pattern of navigating transitions, particularly around structured tasks and time-sensitive commitments like prayer.\"\n\n2. **Questions for Reflection**:  \n   - \"Given the time before prayer, what small action could align with your values or help ease transitions?\"  \n   - \"Are there any tasks that feel energizing or grounding, which might help set the tone for the rest of your day?\"  \n\n3. **Gentle Recommendation**:  \n   - \"If you'd like, I could highlight tasks that fit into short time blocks or suggest ways to prepare mentally and emotionally for prayer.\"  \n   - \"How do you feel about focusing on the tasks that seem most pressing versus those that feel nourishing right now?\"\n\n---\n\nThis structure prioritizes your agency and insight while maintaining a supportive, reflective stance.
