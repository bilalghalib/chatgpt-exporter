      "content": "Can you summarize this and sustain the style of the language:  \nOkay. I hope you don't mind. I wanted to write it up for you, but I don't want to wait too long before sending you something. I'm not sure when you're going to need it, so I'll send you a voice note.  The hands are a product of me and Josephine spending three months in India, and we had spent the first month in the Dharamsala in the north, where the Dalai Lama lives and has his Mini Tibet. It's a very interesting area. In India. They welcomed tibetan refugees and gave them this area where I think it used to be like a british resort or retreat or something for the military.  And we were there for some time because I was a part of something called the compassionate leadership summit, and we were invited to ask a question, basically, to the Dalai Lama. And so both she and I were in the mood of connection, spirituality, and I've been interested in spiritual reality, spirit reality, like the truth that you find when you squint between traditions. And so one of my friends is an indian artist, and she offered us her home after the time in Dharamsala, where Josephine was going to do her art retreat and have access to the Pink palace studio that my artist friend has and to spend some time in creativity and making. And I technically had returned to work to bloom, but I was, I think, infected with this idea, actually.  It's connected to Noor's idea of helping people see the world as a source of beauty, connecting them with craftsmanship, the people that make their products and the lands that they come from. And so while I was in India, I do what I often do is ask, like, what's unique about this place that we could share and share with people? And so what's interesting about Jaipur, where we were, is that it's a brass manufacturing city. It's known for its brass, it's known for its camel leather, and it's known for its miniature painting.  I think there are many minerals and mountains full of gems that they grind up and use in these very ornate detail miniature paintings. And so I was, ah, man, I've always loved watercoloring, and I've had, I always have my watercolor box. I carry it with me everywhere I go. And I got really excited about the idea of making a brass watercolor, something.  I'm not exactly sure how this idea started. I think, you know, the muslim tradition, you use your fingers to count the prayer. And I've been thinking about art and how often art can be used as well. You know, there was a trend in modern art to kind of poke fun at and make commentary about commerce and commercialism.  So, you know, Andy Warhol and art that you can screen print and make a thousand copies of something versus just one standalone, unique thing using the same processes, all that, all that kind of stuff, the Campbell tomato soup and then the art of the ego or something like that. Like a Damien Hirst kind of like doing something that is, that creates shock, right? Like encrusting a skull with diamonds and, I don't know, hanging like a yemenite shark dipped in formaldehyde or something in a gallery. I can't remember exactly, but I was remembering a time period before artists used to sign their names on their works, where they were using art to kind of be a way to share the beauty that they saw, often either in a tradition.  So a lot of mystical art and spiritual art does that with calligraphy or patterns or mandalas and things like that, or in nature. And sometimes they're mixed, as often seen in islamic art. And so I was wanting to say that art can be a thing that we use to connect with ourselves and with beauty and to tie it to some of these traditions. And two of the traditions present in India are the muslim tradition and the hindu tradition.  And so what, it kind of merged and started evolving and came into this way of, you know, you open the hand, and just like a Muslim would count on their fingers, their prayers, you kind of mimic that pattern when you're using the brush, and you're kind of, you know, you can imagine the hope. The intent is that people use that and kind of have this experience of imagining touching your hand or their hand and making the remembrance, which is the name of that kind of prayer. When they use their fingers, the Muslims, they remember different qualities of God or different things that are supposed to help them connect with the present moment. And it's kind of interesting that it's a tactile sensation.  It's a very embodied faith if you see the prayer as well. And then the box has the two positions, right? So when it's closed, it's in the namaste position, where the palms are facing each other. And then when it's open, it's in the more traditional islamic prayer position, two hands, palms up, pinky to pinky.  And so all this symbolism is packed inside of it, and it's handmade out of teak and copper clad cover. And I couldn't get the brass. Like, initially, I wanted it to be solid brass, but it wasn't working out. It was gonna be way too expensive.  And so this was the compromised teak is a waterproof, water resistant wood. And the areas inside of the hand, the palm, have more copper cladding where you can mix the colors. And that's the story of the hand. I could transcribe this, but I hope this is interesting and helpful.  And I would love to hear kind of what stood out to you out of the whole story. And if you. Yeah, what is. What do you think about the idea of creating products that start conversations?  And that's kind of my hope with this thing, is that we'll start talking about, like, well, what is art anyway? What is it for? What can it be? What is the history of art and spirituality?  And how does that show up today? How does it show up for me? How does it show up for me in a very simple practice that I hope is connecting you to a place in the world. And these craftspeople actually in India, whom I also, you know, I spoke with the representative in the company that will help me make these hands.  And these are often places where you can have kind of a classist, stratified society in India. And so the people that wind up making things are from lower caste, and Jaipur is no exception. But while speaking with the guy that is helping us produce this stuff, I made sure that I was able to get in touch with the workers and that they're being paid fairly and that they're happy with their work. And I am happy to share a product that has these principles attached.  And also with the teak, making sure that it's harvested in an appropriate way. Okay, I hope you're doing well. I hope this is a ten minute long message describing the story of a product. It's the story of a girl.\n",

      "content": "Sure! Here’s a more concise version that maintains the essence and tone of the original message:\n\n---\n\nI wanted to share this with you sooner rather than later, so I’m sending a voice note instead. The “hands” are a product of time Josephine and I spent in India. We were in Dharamsala, where the Dalai Lama resides, for the Compassionate Leadership Summit, a deeply spiritual period. Afterward, we stayed with an Indian artist friend, where Josephine had access to a studio for her art retreat, and I was inspired to work on a concept influenced by Noor’s idea of connecting people with the beauty of the world through craftsmanship and heritage.\n\nJaipur, where we were staying, is known for brass, camel leather, and miniature painting. I’ve always loved watercolors, so the idea formed to create something combining brass and art—specifically a brass watercolor set. The inspiration also came from the Muslim tradition of counting prayers on one's fingers, blending spirituality and craftsmanship.\n\nThe hands themselves are steeped in symbolism. They reflect both the Muslim and Hindu traditions. When closed, they are in the namaste position; when open, they mimic the Islamic prayer gesture, with palms up, pinky to pinky. The idea is to create an experience of tactile prayer and remembrance, engaging users in a mindful, artistic practice. It's crafted from teak, a water-resistant wood, with copper cladding inside to mix the colors.\n\nThe project isn’t just about the product, but the conversations it can spark. What is art’s purpose? How does it connect to spirituality today? This piece represents a blend of tradition and craft, tied to real people in India, whose work I’ve ensured is ethical and fair. I hope the story resonates, and I'd love to hear what stood out to you. What do you think about creating products that foster meaningful conversations?\n\n---\n\nLet me know if this captures what you were aiming for!",

      "content": "Certainly! Here’s a more condensed version:\n\n---\n\nThe “hands” product emerged from my time in India with Josephine, where we spent months immersed in spiritual and creative exploration. While in Jaipur, a city known for its brass craftsmanship and miniature paintings, I was inspired by both the local artistry and the Muslim practice of using fingers for prayer. This led to the idea of creating a brass watercolor set that merges art with spirituality, using traditional techniques and symbols from both Muslim and Hindu practices. The design features hands that, when closed, are in the namaste position and, when open, resemble the Islamic prayer gesture.\n\nThis project isn’t just about creating a functional art piece; it’s about fostering conversations around the intersection of art, spirituality, and tradition. Through the tactile experience of using the hands for artistic expression, I hope people can reflect on their connections to beauty and craftsmanship, particularly to the artisans in India. I’ve also made sure the workers involved are treated ethically, ensuring fair wages and responsible sourcing of materials like teak.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to create a product that encourages reflection and dialogue. By blending different cultural symbols and practices, the hands serve as a way to engage people in meaningful conversations about art, spirituality, and the global connections we share through craftsmanship.\n\n---\n\nDoes this meet your needs?",
