      "content": "In the this conversation I shared what’s the book outline I remember talking about 3 sections, can you share it? What are a few other outlines and ways to share my story\n\n[[[it's it's it's like most of the people humans uh on earth not all humans because uh there are still people that are um in the same um uh way that you believed and the whole the world that they're in relationship, that won everything. But uh our uh w Western society, uh based on science and uh capitalism and everything, those people are kind of believing in science neither than the believer take it try to take some steps back and understand the whole like uh uh where where we are our our planet in the universe and what is the universe, based time and uh how what do we know, what we don't know and uh how earth is uh uh uh working instead of uh saying it's doing that it is and uh we are running too much fuel, we are eating too much and it's we can do uh uh in another way. Yeah.  Like fatalism. Yeah. It's fatalism scientism and fatalism that are killing the the sacred uh and yeah, the sacred uh look at the wholeness and but this is why I wanted to get a very um historic view, you know, because you just look I was happening now.  I'm trying, yeah. This is a part of what I want to share. It's like the history. like is it we' just pop up here and and we aren't necessarily like, you know, some people think of progress like this, right?  It just goes, I guess, and we are seeing the most clearly right now. We have the best ideas, the best science, then will you ever have, and tomorrow will be even more clear and more true and more real. There's a Christian of what is progress.  What is progress or like what is true knowledge? And the thing is I don't want to talk negatively about capitalism or negatively about scientism, what I want to say is uh, where did those ideas emerge from? Why is it so much a dominant?  Yeah, and to show like, oh, well, it makes sense that we did that. But also, does it make sense that it we could be overdoing it? Because it does make sense to try to protect yourself, right?  Like let's say, you know, for instance, you've got to a car accident you weren't wearinging your seatbelt. You got hurt. And then after that you start wearing your seatbelt.  That's okay. That's a good lesson, right? And so part of the lesson that, you know, we could have used science to use if we had it back then, to learn about the black plague, is people would already concentrating into cities.  People were already over like I was doing this research today. There were depleting their farms. They were overproducing on their farms, they were getting less returns, so people were under nourished like cities were crowded and dirty and like the conditions were good for a plague, you know?  But uh that doesn't happen in in cultures that don't have something that makes people think the best the right thing, you know? And the to live, to live in this way to like uh have a, uh, also a part of it was the peasant and landowner relationship at this hierarchy of dominance, and that's why I had to go back before the black plague because the black plague made me realize a little bit more about like why people left religion and why people were looking for hedonism and more like focus on life and individualism, but before that there was this bringing in of hierarchy and power structures, because when Christianity was not formalized, it was very diverse, a lot of different opinions. There was nobody to tell you might think that other person is really wrong, but you and 100 people will think that them and 100 people there was no pope, there was no like massive Catholic church. before the Myan creed was decreed, and they brought many different Christians and I think.  NIAN creed. Yeah. NIC EE So this thing.  Creed of constantinople happened in like ten first canceled Nicea 325, not like a 440 451. So it happened about like five 300 to 500 years after Jesus., basically it's after the Roman Empire uh end. Yeah, but it basically transitioned into the Christian Empire, because Constantine became Christian, uh the like it was a it was a Romanonsenseinople, there's double Chchus guy where.  Oh, wow, they have it. And so what I what I started looking into right now was like what were the things that were formalized here? That uh first Council of Contents in O Roman yes, a Roman emperor was the first one to put it together.  And so they inherited a lot of the Romans ideas about power, right? Like what's his name? Um Marcus Aurelius is considered a god, okay?  This is I bought the book uh thought for myself. Yeah, he he's an interesting guy and he's a very thoughtful guy, but in in Roman like early Roman history, the kings were considered gods, right? And so this idea of hierarchy and of an authority that is more important and can control and subjugate the under length begins in the Roman Empire and then gets brought into Christianity because now that there is a an authority in Christianity, now, like all of these people said, like, this is what Christianity is.  We can't have anybody saying that Jesus was just a prophet, we can't have people like differing about these different details. We are now going to sit down and just write like this is Christianity and everyone else is wrong. And it created this uh church people god and the churches in between kind of thing.  Yeah, the clergy and um like the this hierarchy. And and yeah, so so this is what I was sort of to to do this kind of historical analysis. And there's a gap here, like I did it I think I figured out a little bit more about like the black plague and how that led to like individualism and that, you know, at some point leads to capitalism and, you know, it keeps going from there.  But before the black plague, there were the things that gave rise to the conditions that let the black plague emerge, which is congested cities, um, uh impoverished people, uh close, like condition for Yeah. So this this part I want to understand a little bit better, and I think it has something to do with the the Nican creed and this hierarchy that gets imported into Christianity that creates this like peasant landowner divide, which you can so at a seat today in terms of like hierarchical power structures. How do you uh study all this?  I mean, I knew about a lot of these pieces before. but then I started to think like of course I knew about the church. history documentaries, studies. on all the different of these things like I found a book today for the black plague. I'm going to see if I can get it. But basically like I've I've known about, you know, I read a book called Galileo's error and it's about Galileo when he first came up with his idea about the language of the world as written in mathematics, language of the University of mathematics.  He also says, but that doesn't capture quality. That is a separate thing. My whole like mathematical science approach is to focus on what I can actually define mathematically.  But there is quality, but people ignore the quality things that you say and focus on his idea that the world is describable by this systems. And so I know all of these things I have read many books in the history, but I started thinking today about the question of just making it very simple. It's like where did Oneness go?  You know, where did the sense that everything is a cohesive, holistic thing that we're a part of, go and why do we have this alienation and the sense of me versus the world? me. So that's the that's the only question and then I want to look at history through that lens, because I think, like instead of trying to go like talk about climate collapse or talk about alienation or loneliness or war or all of these things.  I think those things are effects of a mindset of alienation, a mindset of other, a mindset of not one of of many and I must protect. And so I'm trying to like go backwards, figure that out. And then what I want to do with the book is give people an experience of wait a second, not, there is quality, you know?  Like, first of all it' be like, that's where my ideas come from. You know? For me, I had this big realization one day because I grew up in a very conservative Muslim family, but uh there's actually a lot of different ways to think about with some, you know?  And in history, there's a lot. And at some point in my life I was meeting Muslims that were like very different than me, you know? They had different behaviors, they were smoking pot and still Muslim and they were comfortable with themselves.  It was like they were g marijuana. They were ganaan Rostafarianyncretic Muslims, okay? Meaning they mixed between inside?  Yeah,. And so I met these people and they were like, yeah, well, most of them Rust God. and Allah Muslim Arabic, right? And so they were like, Jah.  I'm like, whoa, how are you who you are? How? And then I was I had this moment when I was young.  I was like, how am I who I am? And then I started deconstructing where I got my religious ideas from, and its history, which was related actually weirdly enough to the British because the British mess everything up, and Saudi Arabia, and they picked this one gahhe, maybe randomly, maybe strategically, but they p so, you know, in many traditions, everything has a bell curve, everything can be put on a bell curve, right? There's extremes, and then most people are in the middle, right?  is a science bell normal curve.ussian curve. They picked the guy that was just more extreme than everyone else, you know, the guy that's like very strict and very tight and very like difficult with his interpretation, who's like music is had on and everything is had on and you know, like a very uh once make things hard, right? But even in our book theoran it says God wants ease and not hardship, but for whatever reason he skips that that thing when he reads the book, and he gave because he is so funny the history and the accidents.  Look what happens. This guy becomes the king of Saudi Arabia because he's promoted by the British, the British, you know, kind of I handed it over to him and he becomes not the king, but he he influences the king and he kind of creates the the religion of the whole country, right? The most moral looks to Saudi Arabia because it has Mecca, as like the most Mussim place in the world, right?  But what happens is not only are they they already have like Saudi Mecah and like most people think of it as the most most place in the world, they find oil in the 70s. And now they can supercharge their ideology and spread it around the world, right? So when you open up oran in the messages that I was growing up in Michigan, on the front, it says a king, a gift from the king of Saudi Arabia that they were paying for scholars to get trained in their way of thinking, and then they would fly them around the world and implant them in mosques and that's where my ideas came from.  That's where like I was taught it's called stelapism or wabism, okay? Because the guy was named Yeah. Was his name Abdalbin and Wahb?  a very uh, like you said, uh angry thoughts, uh, very strict and controlling. And it's um those people are like, uh help theirselves withorum and no, I don't I't the thing that I was trying to get to here is the interesting thing is there were two accidents that made it so that this interpretation of Isem was mine. I grew up thinking it was just true.  It was the way I understood the religion and like one I know thinks this way and taught me that this is the right way to think. um I didn't know that there was such a thing as diversity and that maybe they have different ways of thinking. I thought everyone else was wrong and we were right, okay? Until I did the exercise and I realized like, okay, the British picked Abdalele in Wahab randomly.  I don't know why they picked them, but they picked him and then, too, is that country that uh uh is now very rich and can spread its ideas around the world. And that's why I have this ideas. And so that's kind of what I want this book to do.  I want people not to just think like, oh, down with capitalism or, oh, down with the, you know, like, let's all take, uh mushrooms and be one with the universe or something and like like dress like Native Americans and live back to the land. No, like there there were different ways of seeing the world that got filtered out and blocked systematically because of historical events and how they influenced culture and philosophy, and all of these things kind of work together, you know? And I think some of those very critical ones are the hundredyear war, the thirty Year War, where most of Europe is just fighting religious wars.  If you know a little bit about history, there was a period where there was a lot of religious wars in Europe between No, religious wars between the Protestants and the Catholics and yeah. And then those those two I don't know how those influen the the thinking, though. Tuesday should be history.  And then before that, there's the black plague and how that influences thing. and before that I think it's the IN creed and how that influences things. So the Niccing creed brings this dominance hierarchy structure, the black plague brings in the individualism. And then after that we have the hundredyear award that removes uh like makes it more secular.  So it's like hierarchical individualistic, secular, scientific, and each those things has a progression. and they add up to each other, right? hierarchy and power, like individual than individual power. Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You getting it. And so, uh, but I think once people see this and then they realize like, oh, holy crap, that's why we're like this. That's why we like people talk about like Western culture What do you expect, uh, which kind of effects?  I want first this realization, this aha of like, oh, that makes sense. That's why I feel that's why we are so disconnected from nature and why people in different cultures have a different relationship. there is like a bias. Maybe there is a bias because not every people are interested in those subjects.  And then even if uh these ideas would be spread and known by everybody, do you think that most of the people would be able to understand. This is why the so that's the prep work. That prepares the mind for the next step, which is the most important step, which is to re access a natural faculty, I think everyone has and everyone knows the faculty that is activated when they sense true love, not lust, the faculty when they see nature that makes them stop in their tracks and just look in awe, right?  This this faculty that knows truth, goodness, and beauty, as, and that those three things are three things, but there are also one thing in a moment of awe, there's no words. Words are the things that take one and make it into many, and so that experience, the faculty of what I call quality, not quantity, not numbers, the quality, is non segmentable, but when you start to put words on it, you use words like beauty, truth and love. But in reality, that's one thing, okay?  And so what I want to do is get people to understand that that used to be an experience that we have, this integrated sense of a whole, this thing where, you know, the thing that in other cultures turns into people communicating with trees and animals, and even if they're going to sacrifice an animal doing it respectfully, only as much as they need, knowing their bounds because they know they're a part of a complete system that is in harmony, that there is an idea of harmony that things are inbaled, the yin and the yang I take when I can and I give when I can and like this kind of less domineering, more integrated, more relational structure emerges from all I want people to do is acknowledge that love is love and it's not so molecule. That's it. And to do that, I think we can take two steps.  One is that this perception is true and that this perception is reliable. Okay? So what what we need to do is help people distinguish between emotions and mood and a quality perception.  Does that make sense? Because some people might think like, I am falling in love. I'm feeling love.  It's like, no, just chill for a second. Wait. Is that love or is this like, excitement?  Is it lust? Is it, uh like, how do how do you know when you're feeling something that is connected to this thing that I'm talking about that is connected to the beyond to this thing that is meaningful and true in a deep way, uh and and distinguishing it from all of these fleeting emotions that go up and down and change and definitely have hormonal and biological and physiological uh can uh relationships. uh and there are people that are studying um awe, right? They're actually looking at a in like the sense of amazement, right?  In neuroscience and cognitive science, and so actually, I think my book is going to require me to do a lot of interesting research finding those researchers that are looking into these things and in in the end, I want to do a historical thing, a scientific thing, and then an experiential thing. can you go these humanity contemplation? Which one the sense of quality? I call it a faculty.  It's just like we have a faculty of hearing and seeing and smelling and tasting. We have another faculty of perception. love, goodness and truth, is the thing that, you know, you see a sunset and you just stop and like, that's amazing. Or like a waterfall or a a beautiful antelope with huge antlers in the wild, and you have this like sense of alive awe connection, reverence, you know?  Or or love is maybe more more most people, uh find it, if they have a sense of true love, like, for instance, you're holding your baby for the first time, right? And then, you know, you might ask people, okay, what happened there? What happened when I'm realizing is like, all of these things happened with an Icyon creed and the dominant structure and then the black plague and being like, I should live my life before I die or whatever.  Like all these things kind of add up to a way of being that blocks that way of seeing, that perception, that faculty that we have. It exists, though. It doesn't go anywhere.  It's like it's like we we have been walking around with one eye closed and they were like, hey, one second, just like try opening this this eye a little bit and like, what. Whoa, I can see in 3D. And that's kind of the the the metaphor that I want to say is we're seeing the world as if we have only one eye and it's flat and we don't have depth perception. It's kind of hard to tell, you know, how far things are.  But then, like once we open that second eye, we'll have depth reception and we'll know how to navigate our difficult and challenging times. It's not that we give up rational thinking or even self-protection. Like put on your seatbelt, you know, use science.  It's okay, you know, these are good things, but it needs to be put into balance with another good thing. And I would say, you know, because this is this is how I think is the right order is truth, goodness, beauty first, and science rationality to serve it. Like, should you should your head serve your heart or should your heart serve your head?  I think your head should serve your heart, you know? So this is my like thinking about it you know the same and uh I was wondering this faculty that that was more developed in the past before I see and maybe the faculty still exists in many cultures. it's meaningful. and do you think this faculty is hurt or maybe step in now This is one of the reasons why I wanted to do the research on near death experiences. A near death experiences, most of the time people come back and they make major life decisions.  Chang non-meaningful things are cut out of their life. They orient towards relationships, um, and it shows that it might take a wake-up call for people to pay more attention and realize what really matters in life, you know. And I think near that experiences do that. um But, you know, the whole planet is having a n nearative experience right now with climate collapse and all of these things.  And so many young people are considering suicide. There are, I think we talked about it last time, underage suicides, like preteenagers killing themselves, worried about the future. That is insane, okay?  Kids, like literally kids. And so the way I see it is like we are having a kind of planetary near death experience. There's a lot of stress and fear about the future.  People aren't having children and might lead to a population collapse. Like there's a lot of these issues. um and it's spilling out into the political sphere, that anxiety about things mean me first, um the France first, America first, refugees leave, you know, it's becoming more protective because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow and has all these negative consequences. And so I think, you know, talking about this and looking at like the research in near experiences and the the qu-quote solution is, I don't really want this book to be understood by everybody.  I just want to create practices that help people like connect to that perceptual faculty and acknowledges acknowledge its existence as a source of reliable and true information that is it's not like a, you know, some people talk about intuition to talk about some of these things. Like I have an intuition. I'm feeling, you know?  But it's just an idea, it's just a feeling, you know? But no, what if we distinguish between feelings and recognition? That's what I'm trying to suggest.  That we just like you recognize something with your eyes, like, this is a pencil. That's a pencil. You you can recognize something with that faculty, that perception.  Instead of saying, this is an intuition and then blowing it off as like, an emotion. an emotional as if it's not real, it'll just come and it will just go, being like, I have an intuition. Maybe I need to like dig into it and open that eye wider to get the message to get that message, right? And so it does involve some things like meditation or prayer or contemplation or just sitting with your emotions until you can see your emotions and then see beyond your emotions.  Like at some point, if you sit with your emotions, you can be like, oh, that's a feeling, it comes, and it goes, but this thing is here and it just stays. only a fancy. Yeah, we have the non-fancy version. We'll get a fancy one someday, don't worry, dear.  No, the toilet is That's right. Only one time the Japanese toilet in our parents' house. You've never really tried it.  Only one time because I was like you can change the pressure. You can make less strong. yeah, I's it's like taking a shower. It's it's less smeary. and spreading.  Yeah, yeah Arabs think of you know like people look at Arabs like dirty Arabs, Arabs look at the Western people and like, you're actually dirty, literally dirty. Definitely dirty. We were talking about this and I don't know, it's I had a family uh during my consultation on it was uh moment dad and uh the two children and uh so one were four years old and a girl was uh I think she was nine and uh they all have the gasro.  Oh no. And uh so uh I I exam then all and um I started with the little one and uh then uh the the mother and then the uh the the two of the the two others and uh at the end I was doing the prescription on the computer and the the little, the little boy, uh four years old, he was sitting on uh the legs of his. And he said mommy, I I shoot on myself oh no it's it's it went through the pens on the mother's legs.  I saw it was shit happens you took them like to the like what did you do you give them to it was only on the legs of the moment the children they went on the toilet and I gave them a tissues, yeah some tissues. four years old if he has a guest who you should wear diapers or something. Yeah. I don't know.  Yeah. So we now have both have our thesis to write. Yeah, but all these subjects are very deep and interesting and I think it's a good uh work yard you you are doing.  And it's very hard because you have to connect a lot of different things. You can have a consensus, but it's very hard to get it get to this point because people will always say that's not true we are all other influences or is just the, you know, it's just random evolution is run down and yeah, this is why one of the things I want to do is make it a a science by trying to build a community of people working on listening to that part of them that I think is a real thing. And then I don't know.  And then basically if it exists, it's gonna be in a tradition. It's gonna be in like a religious tradition or a spiritual tradition. I'm trying to say that this is like this is just something that human beings have access to.  This is why, like I don't think of myself as a Muslim because I grew up in this tradition. Like I had a very big period of exploration and questioning and wondering and it gives me also yeah, it gives me also a structure. But also, I think it's true.  Like I actually believe in the that if people were to think and explore and feel and let go over their biases and their emotions and try to understand, like, who am I? What is the world? Are we created?  Do we just as it just biological? Where do my ideas come from all of these things? That it might not look uh super Arab, uh, but like the fun the foundational principle of the most tradition is there's only one god.  And that he is not divisible, that uh he is the first and the last, and there's uh, you know, all of these like the the foundational principle is there's only one God and that the second most important thing is he doesn't leave us alone. He actually writes writes us stories and messages. I think there's only one thing, yeah.  Oh yeah, or like, uh the the Greeks, you know, with the the god of the things and, it's sort of like just questioning Yeah, they' that's actually kind of what Joe is doing these days. She's exploring the 99 names. And so there's there is only one god, but the the names are just like the Pantheon, like, there's the god of what is this?  the promoter or the advancer? the most merciful, the source of goodness, uh the avenger, uh the so so these like often come in pairs in the in the Muslim tradition, like today is uh we're reflecting on the name of God for the all seeing. One of the qualities uh Rahman.  Yeah. So this is the only Rahman only name of God that's Rahman.. So, the the way that the name works is very much like the Pathan or like Taoism, where there's often these binaries, right?  There's the first and the last, the one that honors people, the one that actually brings people to dishonor. the giver of life, the bring her to death, right? So this is still the one God, but it has these aspects. But the only one name that is ever used on its own is the most merciful. or thou god.  Which is not a description. There's either so it's either a law, which means the god or a Rahman, which means a the most merciful, and when God describes why he sent the messengers it's only to be a mercy for all of the universes. And so you get this idea that it is oneness and the primary quality of this oneness is goodness, love, beauty, truth, how everyone to talk about this all enveloping all nurturing mercy that is a the only other the only way that oneness wants to be understood in the Muslim tradition, at least.  But what I what I want to do with the book is to make it experiential, to ask people to do these practices, to reflect on what they think it means, to look at the history to understand, to to look at like one of the things that's really interesting is most indigenous cultures do have this property of oneness about it. And and being a part of a whole rather than everything is just random and there's a lot of different pieces and segmenting and cutting the world apart. It's the relational element with with everything.  And so I think that means something. I think there's something important to realize there and that Western culture is weird in the world. It's not normal.  It does spread because of the dominance and some of the different principles that cause it to be over overreaching, but to to say like, what would Western culture look like if we brought back the part of us that saw that we were part of everything else? You know? It's not that Western culture should book like native culture and have feathers in our hair or whatever.  No, like there's some really beautiful things about baguettes and berets, you know, it's great. B. B. is really wonderful things about these things, but like it's a special expression in English now? B?  No, I just made it. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay., yes. But but like what does a French culture look like when more French people you know, French people, I feel like are very cut off from religion because of the uh French revolution and because of like its own historical uh history.  But imagine if we didn't even talk about religion and we just talked about, okay, when we got rid of religion and we overemphasized like reason and rationality, we cut ourselves off from intuition, understanding, unity, wholeness, meaning, you know, things that actually make life worth living, and it's not just about eating great cheese and having affairs, you know, and sleeping around. Like there's something more and what would it look like when French culture finally opens up that eye of perception? It will be amazing.  I don't know what it could look like. I was wondering about because there is a French his name is in the one of his show is uh is speaking about French people. And the the history of uh this uh people and uh he is uh telling that uh, yeah, uh we are Gurwa.  And uh What's Gurwa is the old name for French people, because before French, France was uh gold. Oh yeah, the Ga.. and the Gauls and the Visigoths and the Goths, yeah. uh some Spanish Arabic, Italian, uh, uh immigration and the revolution and uh basically is it is kind of speaking uh fast and uh uh t this about uh, uh we don't want a president, we want uh, a piata, you know? Pinett We want something to to to break down and hit a five years we are very how people like uh as you said, uh French are totally kind of the partially related related to this idea of like when it's our responsibility now to make things better, but it's not better, we need to fight the thing that it is and try to make it better, right?  So as it's it's very much like heaven is tomorrow, you know, if we just do the right things and we make the right plan and we create this social safety nets and you know, J John, like the yellow jacket then they won't be angry because they will have their things and and so it's it's very much we need to use our reason and our logic to make life the best. and when it's not the best, we got it wrong so we have to do it again. But the problem is, you can't use that tool to understand everything and make it work. It doesn't happen, and so you keep getting frustrated, you know, because, you know, it's we mentioned, I think the idea of the strip form, you know, uh the the farm where you reduce the number of variables so that you have fertilizer water and seed and you can expect this is the expectation.  Expectation always leads to misery and suffering because you never get what you want. But when you reduce the number of variables in a system, it's more manageable to control with the with our limited human capacities, right? We are not able to reason about all of the dynamic complexities of a food forest.  What you can only do is be a part of it. You know, do your little part, you know, uh create the conditions and and have trust and faith, you know. I think Jesus said, if you trusted God as God should be trusted, you would go out like the birds, hungry in the morning and full in the evening, but every day you will leave you this is not Jesus, this is not be dead.  You you would leave the nest. in trust and reliance and hope and fear that you'll find your warm for the day, and when you find it, you can truly be joyful, you know, and that's a difference of being a part of a system and the gratitude and joy and a wiveness that is there versus I ordered the bigmac on Uri and its taking wait long. It should have been here 15 minutes ago, and I have guests coming and I paid money for this. Okay.  This expectation and this like desire, this kind of way of yeah, and and I think that's also related to why the French keep, you know, pinataing their governments. It's like you're supposed to make everything perfect. It was a good plan..  Why don't we have utopia? What happened? Because there's this arrogance to thinking that you can figure it out.  But we can figure it. I was thinking about the movie June. There is a a part when you know black guy at the he fights with a pole in one uh Paul's dream, Janice is talking to him and he he said, uh uh to understand the process of life you just have to follow it.  And you see the the sand that is a vibrating and doing waves and yeah, I like this uh but that attitude is very not accepted, especially for for governments for businesses, for the world that we're in, it's to understand life, you need to make a map and a diagram and have S do you know the SDGs are? This sustainable development goals, I think I all develop them. yougnore the SDGs. Our government is like, okay, so we have poverty and we are gonna make a pyot and this one has to be smaller and then we're can allocate more resources here and then that's going to move this one, like expand the other part of the government because the minister uh we had the first minister and the he he had he was kicked the out because uh the budget, uh with the idea of all the other uh the group the Yeah, so they they are trying to do this now. they're trying to figure figure it out.  But I wonder sometimes like what my ideas would look like if they're more balanced. Because how does the perception of quality fit into budgeting for a country? How would it look differently if it was accepted that you know, that we can't understand everything, that we have to be integrated into systems that life actually makes sense as we go through it.  Maybe instead of starting and making a budget in the beginning of the year, we do budgeting where every day we are attuned to the reality of our society as much as possible, and allocate appropriately day by day rather than you know, make a big plan or maybe that maybe that's where it needs. Maybe it needs both. Maybe it needs the pie chart and the plan in the beginning, but then every day allocating the allocating, being attuned, talking, connecting to people connecting to what is supposed to do connecting with the feeling of what you're supposed to do you know sometimes people make a good intention in the beginning, like, for instance, me and Duol lingo.  I had a good intention. I wanted to learn French, I wanted to talk with your family, I wanted to be wanted to be. But now I do duolingo just to make the streak, right?  So if I was in touch with the reality, I would either tell myself, okay, you either commit to it or just stop, because right now you're not learning French and you're just doing things to make this number go up. You know, just like people in a budget. We allocated budget to the arts because we wanted to have a flourishing creative community.  Is that doing it the best? Or is there a different way to allocate money to make sure that we have a flourishing creative community? Because there's so many people in jobs around the world, especially in governments and in the UN, where they know that this isn't the best use of funds, but this is what they're doing and they have this creeping feeling of like, this doesn't feel right.  This is wrong, but they just do it because because they don't have this, they only have this. They only have the once a year decision. integ, you know, and countries are basically uh some uh found our lending money to countries, and I think it's so complex now. I don't know how we could maybe erase all.  I mean start again and through like this watching what we are being more grounded realistic, connected to the you know, the the the thing that people kind of hope for is like, okay. We're collecting more information than we know what to do with. AI will solve it.  That's what they're thinking. They're thinking they'll just give everything to AI and it will be able to find the patterns that matter, but what I'm trying to suggest is we can't delegate this because I think that our perception of of goodness is and that feeling of like, is this right? This doesn't feel right, you know?  You can't get that. This it doesn't feel right and we need to be able to trust that. So for instance, this is one of the stories I'm put in my book.  And I think I forget his name, but this Russian general was looking at his uh monitoring system for nuclear warheads, and he saw five nuclear missiles coming from America. and he freaked out. The red light started spinning, the alarms went off, literally he was in the control room. All he had and what his job it was was to monitor this, and if America sends missiles, Russia sends missiles.  Okay. I don't know if you know about the Cold War. Yeah, so that was the Cold War.  That was the the common response to everyone was waiting for the missiles to fall, okay? And he saw the missiles. Why don't we have a story of five nucle explosions in Russia and he didn't push the button.  He didn't call his superiors. He had a feeling that said this can't be. Right.  And he trusted it. We are alive, probably. You know, like if Russia and America had a nuclear war, the world would look very, very different today.  And five nukes from America, let's imagine that they were real hitting Russia. And of course they would target major cities. Like we would live in a very different world and Russia would have anyway, it would have just exploded. and escalated.  So we're alive today and we have the world that is relatively safe without the major nuclear war because someone trusted this insight.. Yeah, it turned out that there was an error. Yeah, it was uh it was light reflecting off of a lake in New Mexico or something like that.  And so you? Yeah, and so I think that that story is like really important. uh and people need to like know about this story and to realize like this idea of creating AI plus our data to make decisions for us and without humans to be able to feel and to be close enough to reality. And this is the other thing that I'm realizing.  This is where it gets a little bit, I'm going to need to do more research on the science element, which is that guy felt something, even though the instruments which were mediated like digitally mediated instruments told him something. It was an artifact of light reflecting off of some clouds and water and yeah, like the radar systems like the I think it was a satellite system. uh But but yeah, it was an artifact that um it confused the machines. So my dad, when his brother died, felt it before he got the phone call, okay?  Many people have stories like this. Okay? And I think it's because this faculty of perception of um of oneness is one.  It's not to it's not spatially dependent. It's so that person looking at the radar had a disconnect between this faculty and this faculty. He sees the radar and it says that missiles are coming, but this thing says that they are not right?  How did that how did that thing know? That's So so this is where it gets like kind of into the place where it's like a little bit crazy, you know, where you start saying like, okay, well, you can you can perceive the right thing to do uh because it digests everything that matters about this decision and gives you a sense of it. So, and it's trustable and reliable, but it digest everything in all time and all space for this moment, you know, like relevant for this moment, but it doesn't actually matter about how far you are from the thing.  That's the kind of this is like I'm not sure if I need to go there for this argument, but that's what this story tells us. That this person had a faculty that was connected to the reality of what was happening beyond his line of sight and the instruments that were telling him what was happening were at conflict with it, but he trusted his intuitive sense or his quality sense or whatever. I think I need a better word for it.  Like I I I use the word quality, but I don't think people um I'm trying not to say things like heart and I'm trying not to say things like soul or spirit or anything that can sound religious. uh and quality in quantity or I think really good pairs of antonms, you know, it's like the quantity of things. You can measure like how far this thing is. You can measure how many, you know, silicon atoms make up this thing if you had a really it's not enough I think it may be why you try to search another word.  Do you have any ideas isn't heart? Or intuition? I'm Yeah.  And uh I was thinking about two things? The gravitation we detected a recently? Yeah, the gravitons or yeah.  The black holes that collapsed and it made waste and we could uh detected because the crazy thing is things were squished together. like isn' that crazy? Yeah. like space time squished and we got squished too, but we we didn't feel it. a very little bitters. But no, and I was thinking also about in the movie when the woman I say uh love isn't uh meatmeasurable, but it can cross space and time, you know it's interesting movies gravitational waves the kind of keep the information and it's not uh influ influenced by its base and time, you know, it' it's crossing space time.  But isn't everything crossing space time? Like right now, if you do this, you're affecting the farthest star at the end of the the universe.? Because, you know, gravity has an R squared relationship R is the distance, right?  But it never goes to zero. And so by moving my head over here, there is slightly more mass over here and the entire center of mass of the universe has shifted because I did this, right? And so it as a real effect, but that's the idea.  You can sense it if you if you are very, very very very extremely super ultrasensitive. you could sense it on the moon, you could sense it. You know, they you can actually see these experiments with gravity here where, you know, you put a bowling ball next to something and they can actually sense the amount this thing moves towards it, right? So you have a bowling ball on a string and a on a string and they actually can see it's very, very tiny amount.  But because the bowling ball has mass and it war up space time, then this thing moves, right? And so it doesn't take the graitation waves. It just takes mov, you know?  Everything is literally connected. Everything is talking to everything at all times, even just gravitational. Like I'm pulling you towards me and you're pulling me towards you right now.  Like Newton? Yeah. I'm not sure, because uh Einstein kind of uh uh you know, change everything musicfficient. money.  Newton said the third law, when two masss are there, they are it's so Einstein's idea is space time, but you are warping space time. So I concentrate space time. Yeah, a little bit.  I concentrate space time over here, which is why you feel the effect of being run. It's not necessarily like yeah, I I'm bending you a little bit towards me instead of using the Newtonian affects uh like uh never goes to zero. Yeah, yeah, to zero.  So yeah, that's the idea. So because it does affect everything at all times. Yeah, what I want to say is that, uh scientist of physicist say says that our universe is, uh um oh, there is a name an ejective to say that the physics low are the same at each point of the universe.  Self- consistence or something like that. Yeah, it's it's a very special word in French. and uh so because it it's never going to zero, but uh at our level we can't really see the the effect. But I was thinking, does does this gravitational effect could be related to the quality??  I don't know. Maybe I don't I don't I don't want to to uh explicit or to define it to try to to figure out uh what it could be related to, because uh it could it would be reduce it just like everything else. I think it no, no.ropic.  Yeah, yeah. Is. You know, sometimes this this thing we mentioned earlier, like when you are struck by something so awe inspiring, you usually don't have words, right? You're just yeah, you your reduce it to.  I yeah, I don't know. It's just How could it be meaningful and wordless? It's it's very interesting that the most meaningful things are often associated with moments of speechlessness.  And then later, a poet tries or an artist tries their best to evoke it, right in their poetry or their art, they try to put words on the unword did. truths, love, and goodness. goodness. It's it's also it's not just my uh language. This is like one of the things that um philosophers and theologians think of as kind of foundational elements of it.  There's an additional one that I use, which is beauty, but I think beauty is sort of like electricity in a solar panel, like when they' when you uh like like love and beauty come together, uh, when you love something you find a beautiful and when you find something beautiful, you love it, and so it's like the forces, right? It's it's war big space time and pulling things towards each other. That's what love does. love like takes things that are distant and tries to bring them together.  And I think that's actually a very interesting way of thinking about love as a as a force. It is actually a unifying force. Like people see each other from across the room and if they love each other, they just want to get closer and closer and closer and so they start kissing, you know.  And then they want to get inside of each other, just like become one, you know And actually, you know the weird thing is, I know it sounds very crude, but I think there's like if you look with the eye of metaphor and that nothing, well, it my interpretation, God does, is an accident, this stuff is very meaningful, like even even the sexual act as that representation of like, what does love want to do? It wants to bring things together and to take things and bring them to make one and then actually as what life comes from and like you can think about these metaphors and you can realize like, wow, man, God is hilarious, first of all. And and he's like telling a really good story here.  I'm searching a world because I have the impression that not that far. I was thinking about contemplation and Hm. Yeah, it's hot funny. good work.  You know, there's this relationship between, um love and attraction, it reminds me of one of the you know, things that the in the Muslim tradition says, like, why did God create all of this? And it goes like this. I was a this is God speaking.  He says, I was a hidden treasure that wanted to be known, and so I created so that I could be known and uh like this idea of love and knowledge is kind of evoked in this. It's like to to love and to to to to know and to be connected and um it kind of reminds me of some of the uh Indian philosophies about the Brahmin and this idea of oneness getting bored. and then hiding in multiplicity to recognize oneness and then to awaken to go back to oneness. This kind of idea uh kind of rhymes with this idea of being a hidden treasure and not being admired or known or loved, and creating in order to be able to to love and be loved. and that the and it's kind of interesting that love is the thing that takes the many and makes one.  And and it's interesting that it's actually, you know, what we just thought of historically. It's fear that takes the one makes many, right? It's the fear, the need for control, the it's so interesting.  I think love and fear are like love love is the unifying principle and fear is the the disunifying or the dispersing principle. Maybe it could be h harmony, liality harmony? Harmony, that is a result.  I think of following your perception of well, because I I asked IGPT I could be resume in one word roof, love, beauty, and goodness. You know what we can do as well, we can ask the similar question. We can ask um, can you come up with ten different ways to say quality versus quantity?  We want to find a new word for the faculty in that perceives quality. Okay. Let's see.  Let's see what it says. Depth versus breadth, substance versus substance versus scale, essent essence, versus extent, nuance versus count, value versus volume. OK, this sounds pretty good.  Meaning versus measure. Right?? Yeah, you either measure things, you know the own space and your distance or your like sense of meaning.  I like meaning quality versus quantity or meaning, and they both start with them. versus measure. That's not bad. Beauty versus bulk no.  Integrity sensna, discernment, value versus volume. That's kind of interesting. Value versus volume.  Nuance versus count. depth versus breadth. Substance awareness. Eence essence perception. essence perception.  I like the essence perception and discernment discernment and meaning can we go down this track? pisses conscience wisdom. Yeah, I mean, I think listening to it implies like that you're getting closer to wisdom.  I think like when we are listening to our lower like feelings of like fear, like jealousy or uh, you know, these like like can be addressed by tapping into the thing. It's like, okay, it's I'm feeling really angry or uh jealous, but when you listen to that faculty, how should I respond? and this is why I think the fundamental name of mercy really matters, and the fundamental like purpose of being to know and connect with a hidden treasure of like truth, beauty, and goodness is your your quality sense will never tell you like hurt someone else or hurt yourself, right?  It will never tell you yeah, I'm not so sure if the missiles are coming or not, but just fire anyway just in case you know I don't think that's going to be what happens. Usually, like the sense of meaning is also connected to self sacrifice on the opposite side of things, right? Like when we see Jesus or Gandhi or Martin Luther King Junior or pick any famous like story of someone that the band of brothers or okay, maybe not you, uh 300 uh yeah, yeah, all those people.  They lost. They all died, but they died with like honor and it left us feeling inspired, right and left us connecting to some of these qualities of years ago something it's not beautiful and the the aesthetic sense, but there's something beautiful about how they stared together and faced instrmumentable odds, and even if they died, they died with honor and there's something beautiful and good about that, right? And so it's it's something I think there's something very interesting about self-sacrifice. uh that kind of is important in this uh in this thing because it shows like the self doesn't matter.  There's like a a things a wholeness that matters more and being in harmony and in integrity and upholding what wants to come through your your your meaning sense or whatever we're calling it, you know, is more inspiring than you staying alive. But when you're in the fear, you just want to stay alive, you want to control, you want to substigate. It's like I will, I will, I will.  And like all these billionaire, you know what they're doing? They're building homes and compounds in islands around New Zealand. because they expect ocean levels a rise, New Zealand will be okay, um, they expect that this refugee mass migration thing will happen. They don't want to be on any land mass that's contiguous with other countries that are going to be experiencing climate collapse.  And they're thinking of self and self-p protection, and it's ugly, right? Like you don't you don't hear the story of like how billionaires are looking to preserve themselves. They hired a futurist named Douglas Rushkoff.  They asked him okay, we figured out the food, we figured out the land, we figured out all this stuff and we have money and we bought our place and we can survive. um and we have the people working on the farms and and all of this. How can we be sure that they won't revolt? and take over the property and like we're just one or two billionaires.  It's like a small billionaire family. How can we be sure that the personnel don't work together to kill us and just live on the island, right? And uh the the answer uh was, you know, you want, because you're a billionaire to delegate all the work.  You don't want to go and dig in the fields and figure out food and you'll kill the chickens. You want to hire people to do that. You want to pay people with food probably, right?  Because we're imagining an ap apocalyptic situation. And so what they were suggested to do was they have to do one thing and keep one thing under their control, which is food storage. They need to have the only set of keys you know, maybe biometric, maybe it's connected to their eye retina or fingerprint or something that people can't like chop off and use that needs to be connected to a very well-p protected sealed safe of food storage.  And if you do that, then you can control the rest of the situation. So I only tell that whole story. First of all, just to show you how that's ugly.  You hear that story and you're not inspired. You think this person is horrible, you don't feel like that's what we should be doing that's a good life, that's a good way of living, and we know that, but what knows that? Because it's the world Yeah, the thing that knows that, I think is that meaning sense. is that sense that says like that's not meaningful.  You might survive, but like you'll like, if you really sat with this and you didn't look at the fear that was making you do all that planning, you wouldn't be proud of yourself likely, right? I think, yeah, but just told it's kind of how our world is actually functioning. It's a real story.  It's not a hypothetical., you already told me this story of the billionaire in New Zealand. Yeah, I think it's a million people are those rich people want to try to stay in comfort and, you know and not helping people. But I was thinking about the whole stone.  It's actually how our world isn't right now, you know, the trillioners the most rich people in the world, those people are owning the industry of meat, of chemicals, and the the system, the political system and the economic system is built. so that we are like slaves working and keeping in control and the richer people, I know it sounds like communism and but uh the idea is there and it's still a bulful uh I think somebody once told me that one of the most important things that you can do for your freedom is to grow a little bit of food. It doesn't have to be everything, but just a couple of carrots, just a couple of like potatoes or onions or eggs or chicken. Once you start to realize like self sufficiency, even in a small way, like you get that feeling like, oh wow, like, because right now, I the way that I think about what you were just saying is it's sort of like these um the system as holding security and food and shelter hostage, and we have to, even though we know the system is broken, many people know this they feel like they have to go through these steps of getting a job doing these things in a certain way to be able to access the fundamental basic needs of metal hierarchy, great food, shelter, security, stuff like that.  And it's true. It's it's actually true. Like right now that's that's how the food is behind the paywall, you know?  It's interesting that they are thinking about these universal basic income and But I think about this food thing sometimes I'm like, hmm, if we owned some land somewhere and a farm that made enough food, and I looked into it. It doesn't actually take that much land and that much uh space to produce enough food for a year. Detroit I'm looking at property and So I also have like my family and my cousin's already there and yeah, it's actually really great. in terms of water excess.  It's one of the few places in the world that will benefit from climate collapse longer growing seasons, fresh water, a lot of people are weirdly enough, a lot of people this is why we should probably buy land there before too long, is people want to come to Detroit because of climate collapse. But uh yeah, other than Detroit, Russia But why would I want to go to Russia? Montes.  I thought about um Kurtisistan, also like wanna connect with roots and history and and meaning in a broader sense, right? Like what would. It's pretty fertile.  Okay, if you like mountains, there's mountains too. I am, yeah, actually, there's probably some good claiming. Kurt anymore.  Kurtan? It's I think it exists. Curtisistan never really existed in the nation stateway because the colonizers didn't realize that that was a people and they were like, well, the map should look like this, and this should be for France and that can be for England.  England, what do you think? Okay, no, no, this can be for France. They literally did that.  Do you know that? They got together. It's called the Sykes Peaks agreement.  You know about this? And they got a big map and they they drank a lot of coffee, smoked a lot of cigars and they literally drew a map. like this, and they called it putting wines in the sand, and there's some like really funny stories, like I forget, like I want to go find the thing. It's like apparently someone had their cup on the map and like somebody went a little bit like this and had to like avoid the cup and and and so you see the map of like one Yeah, you see you map with some of these countries and and it looks like and there's like this little zigzag in it and they're like, oh yeah, that was because I just didn't want to move the cup when I was, you know It's crazy.  It's it's just like when you realize like because and the rest of the world, like you look at Europe, all the borders are like this, you know? And that's people of either mountain range or that's people fighting this way and these people fighting this way. and like at some point they're like like, let's just call it a country and, you know, so let's stop fighting, you know? And you have like these very organic borders of nature and people, right?  Africa. Middle East Africa say America, like there's one states square. Yeah, but those are states in in one country, supposedly, but uh, just like the Middle East and Africa and all these places are just so so funny.  I wonder how like it's really good to be really curious, but it takes a long time for things to come together. you know? It takes a long time for things to come together. uh so well things like this this this kind of book that I'm writing, it started off because I wanted to write something about economics and I wanted to talk about like a different economic system. And then I realized that like economic systems come from like worldviews and then I wanted to like think about world views.  But because I've been such a nerd and so curious about so many things, I can actually like piece something together and was really interesting is that finally at the end, the the thing that I'm talking about is um is one thing is just one thing. It's like, and and by talking about this one thing, I can address all of the other things. I can talk about economics.  I can talk about like, why did we build this economic system? It's like, oh, because fear and need for control after, you know, the the black plague and like the council of Nicea and like hierarchy and that led to this these philosophers and history. And then in the end, it's like, I hope it's very practical.  Like I want in the end, even if the book doesn't sell, nobody cares. I want to start a coaching process that the only thing it is, it's related to have to and want to and to help people take there to do list and break it up into one of these two columns and then over time make more of their to do list on this side. That's it.  I think if we did this, what we're doing is we're getting people to connect with meaning more in their life that brings all of these other principles that we were talking about of like connecting to oneness or understanding um like their part in a broader whole because the a lot of the have toos are the I have to work to be able to eat. I have to do these things and usually they are not how you want to be, but how you think you have to be, and they usually come with tensions. They're like I have to go to work so we able to eat, but it's not happy I have to go to work usually.  It's ling this tension. And so when we do this coaching and we look at the tensions and then we ask, is it true? That's a pretty good start.  I think just doing this with more people, we can we don't have to explain all of history and where the ideas come from and we'll connect people more with their perception of meaning. It will give them more awareness of their feelings and why they have them, their anger, where they come from, you know, just by looking at your tualist and comparing half twoss and wanttos, and then asking about tensions. So this is a coaching practice that I'm developing and it's kind of comes with the book.  Wow, that's kind of cool. I think it's all because I've been working on this for a while, and initially I was working on like the economics book and then I tried to work on this philosophy book and then I worked on the the practice, but I think I have a very clear way of explaining how they all fit together. It's like there's like the understanding of the past, um how like history and philosophy evolved over time to disconnect people from oneness and then like so the core theme is this oneness principle uh and how do we get back to that?  That's I think the simplest way of explaining everything without having to get into so much detail, because there's it could be a lot of detail. I realized that I'm pretty much uh uh like, yeah, I I'm aware and I try to change to be more connected to the quality and uh the things that I want to and but I realize that I am functioning my life that I built my life and I'm functioning really much more like uh on the quantity how it works and what I have to do to get in and if you do you want to try going through the coach? Because I still have to um develop this.  I still have I only have tried running a a few times with a few people. It might be interesting to. Yeah, it could be interesting to try and it could also help you to develop it.  I'm not sure I yeah, I think I would be a good subject for for trial. But uh the thing is that maybe uh since I I passed the the 30 I uh I studied uh changing like trying to get more want to Yeah, you know, trying to to do some meditation, to to be more healthy and to yet do things that are meaningful and hmm it's still hard to do it right. Because is there right Yeah, but that's the whole uh that's is whole problem.  It's just uh I'm too much uh control. Yes. That perfection.  Yes. Yeah. That's interesting.  Well we can um we can try this like to to do this and we might not figure it out immediately, but it could be interesting to see, you know, every emotion tells you something. It's a it's an indicator of a way of being that is being blocked or prevented from uh happening. And so when you have these um feelings of like need for okay, I need to do it right, even myself development has to be right.  And you know it's all the medicine.. I think it's a big uh influence in my life. I I already I was already a bit like this before and it it went uh exacerbate exacerbate, yeah.  Yeah, with the medical students. Yeah yeah it makes sense. So it's it's like you learn these unconscious things about needing to be right Yeah, yeah, basically yeah, it's this.  I learn to, like, you know the science uh demar the method? The method It's all about uh what we we say before. the quantity, the trying to control things. Yeah. yeah.  And and you know, one of the ideas was not to have necessarily big transformations, but the idea would be to try to listen for this quiet voice, you know, this intuition, this feeling, and to answer its call, however, best you think you can, and then to reflect on was that better or worse, you know? So, for instance, like let's say, it might be a it was an interesting one. Like, when you let go of control with the barber, you didn't come in, with a picture, right?  That's a small experiment and easy one, yeah. So can we come up with more of these things and gradually build up to the bigger ones like relationships for sure. And you know what I told you about it's one big point in my life because I still feel a little a little bit guilty, uh with uh whether I I have done to her. with the history of the pregnancy and the abortion and uh and the whole all the um the very uh conflictual relationship before and after this event and uh yeah, and kind of uh always uh um questioning myself uh, either I uh school or uh did I school at all?  Did I uh h do uh bad things uh uh should I have uh uh cultivate more on this relationship uh was she uh the woman of my life uh does the the the entuition I I had before and now, uh what does that mean? Am I uh uh am I right? uh I don't know.  It's a lot of a lot of thoughts. So, uh, you know, coming from from my perspective, there is this uh this idea, especially for people that are on the path. You know, there might not be perfect, but they're on the path that when they die, they will look back, they will give you know they say life flashes before your eyes when you die?  That people on the path will look back and they look at their life and see everything that happened and not want a single thing to be changed. But that's for, I think, especially for people that are on the path that started on the path and then sustained on the path. um throughout their life. Whenever they started, it doesn't have to be starting uh, you know, from the beginning, like from birth.  But it could be that you, you know, there's this idea of uh penance and repentance and going to the confessionary or whatever it is in the Catholic Church. But this idea of like, if you have this intuition that you've done something that you aren't proud of, uh, one is it's in the past, but just make a commitment that you won't do that again, that you've learned your lesson. That's why we do bad things.  You know, there's a saying in the lesson tradition. If you lived and never made any mistakes, God would replace you with another society that made mistakes and asked for forgiveness so that he can forgive, because he is the all forgiving, right? And so this idea of like mistakes are not a mistake.  They're actually necessary part of a process of cultivating the heart of becoming like imagine if you've never made any mistakes and you died and you you know, a lot of life is about Catharsis. It's about like okay, that happened, but this time I'm gonna do a differently and then regular and then being you can be proud of yourself for doing it differently. You know, like, I had a similar thing in my life when I had a previous partner that, uh asked me if I love her, and I was like, I define love. like bring me a diction.  I literally ask for a dictionary, okay? I was like, I don't want to say anything is not true. Like, what does love mean?  you know, and because I couldn't acknowledge it because it would require me to fight my family and like, there was a lot of, you know, difficulties around this. And so I for a long time, I felt like, oh my God, I lost the person that I loved. I many thoughts similar to yours, right?  But uh, because there is one important point, uh, you you said here is when one partner is more in love than the other, and Inez was totally in love and she was very committed and I felt like uh I was uh hurting him her and I was uh uh evil and uh and uh yeah, I felt it really bad, you know, really guilty and bad, like sad. And uh that's why I had these uh whole circus of uh getting back with her, uh stopping and then getting back but you weren't sure what to do and then when you were in it didn't feel right. 20 times and uh yeah, that's why I asked myself, do I really love her, but I was not enough material to trust myself to trust my feelings? or was that not a good relationship and and I should uh just uh trust my uh what I felt and and stop it and not come back.  I remember this idea that we said that the faculty of meaning intuition and it's hard for me to trust my intuition because I have a lot of intritions and sometimes I was like, yeah, it's it's hers and sometimes I was like, knowing it can work because we are two different and so, you know, it's even now it's still hard to really be sure. So so and I think now things are really too much uh uh painful and then it's it's it's it's over. It's too it's it's screws. everything else too distant Yeah, but everything is damaged. and it's's damaged forever.  Yeah. I mean let's go back. What was that that message I was gonna say?  It was like is it true, first of all, uh the thing that okay, two things. One is there is probably a process of view that you can get clarity on, which is I know that people don't like this idea of sin, but you mentioned it yourself like, and was I evil, right? Like, what are the things that you want Sin, right?  There's uh doing bad, right? Uh, but you don't we don't usually talk about these things or even say like I was a bad person or I did something bad, but we sometimes do things against ourselves, against our own better judgment, against what we think is beautiful or right, like sometimes we are the billionaires building things and and so maybe like one of the things that you can just get clear on is what are the what like what are the waves that I was that I don't want to ever be again? One, you know, I don't want to do XY or Z or I don't want to respond like however it was, right?  With um with avoidance and distancing saying, I don't want to, you know, and and then just like ask for forgiveness and forgive yourself, and then never do them again, you know? And instead of being clear, like was I evil or was I like was I? It just be clear for you.  It doesn't have to share with anybody. I just like decide, like these are the ways that I want to be and these are the ways I don't want to be. So instead of the lessons being a little blurry, make the lessons very clear, you know, make it very clear, and then I feel like you need some kind of very it feels like a decision should be completely closed and what you can do is say, you know, that relationship is done.  I'm going to take these lessons. I know who I want to be now. I know how I want to be in relationships. um you know, it could have been a beautiful relationship.  I don't think there's only one size fits all for relationships. I think the opportunities for loving there is this idea of oneness we talked about. And it's one of the things that I told myself is like, everyone has a heart and a and a soul that's worth loving.  It's coming from the one and it's in a lot of different people's bodies, right? If I allow myself, if somebody is like, I'm willing, why would I say no? Why don't I also try to be willing, right?  What can I do to help open that door, right? And and I had like the intuition and so we cultivated and we work on like developing a love relationship. It's not this idea of like she was in love or I wasn't in love.  It's just an opportunity for someone to open the door to their spirit was available to you, and you missed it, but everyone has a spirit. Every one you might find that opportunity you likely will find that opportunity again. right? Because I feel like when you just said, I missed it.  I feel like it. And I feel like uh there is the only one, the, you know, the the the love of my life, the only one, and and he's gone and it's over. No, no.  I don't I don't think that at all. I think I think basically like I mentioned, the way that I feel is that you can love it's. If somebody is opening their heart, like, I'm willing, and you're like, okay, well, am I willing?  And like I said, mentioned last week, it was like arranged marriages, you don't need arrange marriages. It's good to have practical things too. It's good to have um compatibility things too.  It's good to have sexual attraction, it's good to have all these other things. But then if someone's like yeah, like, I'm willing.. You willing.  Maybe it could be good, you know, like, I had these it's a feeling that I missed it. And there is one up there is nobody else, but uh but it's just a feeling and I feel like you and I uh I know that it's not true, but uh this is why I think live with this film. I think it's connected to the the regret and the remorse.  Right? So there's like this this um what is that? self-fl flagellation?  because I was bad explore this idea, you know it's it's kind of weird, but I have this masochistic, this note on my uh on my iPhone, which is called the C. Is it like understanding yourself? Yeah, yeah.  Like problems to analyze and uh some kind of introspection to try to find out and figuring out what's not working, what went bad, and uh I have this this idea of uh self uhician. I think this is why I was talking about accepting the lessons, digesting them and committing to never doing them again, asking forgiveness from you from God from whomever, from you as even maybe, it might be very cathartic to ask for forgiveness, if you can not ask to get back together, but just tell her, like, whatever it is, okay? Just ask for forgiveness. like's like I come and I ask for a forgiveness as if I wanted to to to feel better, you know?  Then do it for yourself, but what I'm what I'm seeing is if you don't forgive yourself here, you might maintain this potential I lost a love of my life and I'm never going to have this like again, uh kind of feeling, but I had some intritions that uh indicate indicated in indicated mirror that uh could be could be? Okay. The the idea of the one person is is interesting to to look into uh there there may be something about like some compatible people, but what does it mean for someone to be the one?  Where does that idea come from? versus there's many people and you know how many people find the one that are high school sweethearts, you know, they met in in college or whatever you want to call it. They fell in love.  They got married, and then they get a divorce, okay? Like, there life is hard and long and lots of things change. And there's many examples of this whole like I think that movies and culture shapes are understanding a lot of relationships.  And doing this whole movie historical analysis of like where do my ideas of love come from for yourself? uh, could be interesting. parents, movies. Yeah.  And and these stories but then also looking at it with the lens of like facts, right? Like you know, like even just this idea of what does falling in love mean? This is why I give you that book, because, you know, like there is there's and relationships and compatibility and all of these things that we're we're trying to navigate and is like living together, you know, like there's just people that they might love each other, but they have very incompatible lifestyles or whatever and and this is why I think like having this maybe the both eyes thing, like the pie chart and the uh feeling, it's like, okay, this does this make sense?  Is that person willing to gradually open their heart to me? And am I willing to do that with them and making love a process? And of course, like there could be a moment of intuition.  There could be a moment of like expansion and excitement and enthusiasm. But that just opens the door to the process. This is the thing.  I think people think that you fall in love and then that's it. Instead of viewing relationships as a craft, you know? And I think you have more of a discoverer than a craft perspective and it could be balanced a little bit more with the craft. to to fabricate to make to evolve to build together craft. craft is more like actually craft is the perfect balance between quantity and quality. because exactly. the potter making the pot, right?  It has a weight, it has specifics, they want to use the right amount of water with the right amount of clay, they measured, they mixed, right? But then when they get down to actually shaping it, it's still very precise ashemisymmmetric, but they are doing both the measurements and the feeling and the quality and the perception all at the same time. It's like You know?  And that's why I think craft is a great analogy and actually this is the analogy that I use for um how I want to do my uh my my programs and and um my trainings is to view it more of like a craft uh and putting things together with both your quality and your quantity at the same time. And of course, I'm just probably reinventing Taoism or something, but uh you know, they call it cho Have you heard of choiceless action? Wui?  Choiceless action? Yeah, it's called woo. It's, you know, you might hear it from what's his name?  uh, Bruce Lee, it's like acting without acting. Like, you're not thinking about punching, like a punch happens and it happens through you, and it's like a it's when you're in that space where maybe you could think of what way is what people do when they're in the zone, right? Where let's say that you're watching an Olympic athlete do a very complicated thing.  I don't think they're thinking about all the different steps because they've become the steps. and it's like an action that happens through them of them, and it's like craft of themselves in their bodies and whatever it is, right? Yeah. So it's called wui.  It's a Chinese like Taoist principle of it's called a choiceless action. as a one way of interpreting it. It was it would be like factories and industry and the opposite side, you have arts and in between craft. Yeah.  I think so. I think that's like a good description uh and I think though, like art and craft used to be more together. And then because of you know it's like when things get more extreme, uh there has to become a middle. you know, like Yeah, it's like here's and then like art yeah, and art just becomes weirder and weirder and less and less like yeah and then here's like industry and industry is just like getting super brutalist.  Everything is minimalist and art becomes like illegible and and kind of nonsense and what's the what that boyfriend that was making sound art when one of your cousins was dating this very tattooed guy and it doesn't matter. Well, you understand like this, so art art gets weird, okay? He he was dating one of your cousins, I think.  He's a nice guy. We saw him at some family reunions when we went to Bootzeg and saw your aunt. your grand.. Do you remember it?  Yeah So he's like moving our like way out I forget. He was a nice guy, okay? But like our life.  Yeah, it was out there. But like like you know when you go down to Mar Bell or lead and you walk by um some of these older houses and you just see like the tile work or the bricks and how they were made and like artisanship and art and practical life and uh artistic life weren't so disconnected. They were actually more harmonious.  And it was it's really beautiful to like think and then we go into modern buildings and modern life and it's an it's so funny. It's like um it's like oatmeal that you didn't mix, okay? You have the bland wall that's flats and modern and whatever, and then they hang a painting of some like really abstract art, you know, and it's it's like you have the industry of the building and the the weird art that moved all the way out this way, and then they try to mix it, but like in the middle is craft, you know, and it's you don't need to hang a you know, of course there's a lot of art in a church already, but like it's integrated into the building.  It's the windows. It's not a painting on a flat wall with like minimalist aluminum siding, you know? It's kind of interesting that there's this it's like what the balance, but they balance it by putting to extreme side by side instead of instead of like oil.s very interesting.  But this is what I think an artistic sensibility might be one of the ways that we can describe this, is the thing that we're trying to to activate here in the quality. If we talk about quality, if we talk about meaning, we talk about all this stuff. Like people might not relate.  But if we talk about like developing an artistic sensibility, you know, like to just see things more with like sense and meaning and metaphor and creativity and beauty and arts and stuff. That's hard to do for people that are not trained or not or in the opposite uh condition. And that they get trained to be more and more rational rational. oh yeah, you can't even tell a story.  What can we do this could be an interesting that's true. That's that's the problem. And it's hard when you realize it even when you realize it you try to say?  Yeah, try to it it's hard because you don't have a um I used to to read the books and how it works and uh the the The structure in the instruction, you. And so I don't have instructions to try to, yeah, andalyze my previous relationship, you know how to not uh know if it was wrong or good or yeah. Did you have this sense of quality?  Yeah. I think you might have already done it you keep a journal, like just a journal. That isn't about your patience.  Yeah. I not my patience, but uh uh my patients yes, but not me. So I think there is like good ways and not so good ways to do journaling.  I think, you know, I used to journal a lot um and one of the ways actually, maybe the next book I should give you is this one. It's called the artist's Way. and the key practice in the artist way is ad journaling, but it's in a very specific way. It's you start writing and you're not allowed to stop writing until you fill three pages, okay?  You're not allowed to stop or slow down, you're supposed to just start writing, and even if you don't know what to say, you could fill a whole page with I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, I don't know what and it's totally fine. But it's called freewriting, okay? And once you do that.  And you trying to figure out what I shouldn't. But but usually, like you say like, okay, so today is Thursday, I'm just waking up. I feel a little tired.  I'm not sure what to write, but I'm gonna try. I'm doing this artist way thing. It's kind of interesting.  I'm not really sure if I'm can be creative. is like it really what what is creativity? Well, I guess I'm writing right now. Isn't that creative?  you know, like, you start with nonsense and then by the end, you'll see like it starts coming together. But you're not supposed to read it. You're supposed to take it, put it in an envelope and seal it for at least six months, okay?  The whole point is not to judge yourself, uh, to not think that it's important or that it's not important. The whole point is to turn on the engine of creativity. Just by writing three pages and not looking.  The rest of the book is is expanding on that, uh basic thing, um including how do you get artistic inspiration? And she recommends going on an artist date. So like, what's the place that is inspiring for you could be going to the mountains or the beach or a museum or a concert, whatever it is, like, what is something that actually charges you, creatively and inspiring you and do the morning pages, which is the journaling thing.  That's it. You don't need to read the book now, like, you're good. There's a lot of practices, there's a lot of things to do, but uh like week one, yeah, there's a whole process.  You know, maybe I should do that. I think it will. I can take it.  You need it? I'm thinking about doing it. Okay. you know missing?  Yeah, I've done done the process before. but I've been wondering what my craft is, you know, like we talk about being an artisan. and I think that is important for any human to have their job, to have their life, to have their family, but to have a craft. But what is it? Is it baking bread?  Is it writing books? Is it? I guess I do a lot of my craft, but like Yeah, I guess part of me is is between this half two and one two.  Like there's there's stuff that that wants to happen through me, right? uh foraging, you know, um that just happens. I'm like, wow, I'm foraging.  I love it. It's just, you know, like I walk with a baby foraging, looking for mushrooms. Oh yeah.  Okay, so foraging is on I want to. it's not even like I want to. It's like emerges, right? And then I have to like sometimes I wish I could draw better, you know, like I want to draw more.  I and but I I don't find the flow and the I'm not sure. So there's like there's something over here about drawing, you know, when I think about like my creativity. Like I want to like draw.  I want to make um stencils. And uh yeah, I guess I'm kind of doubting my craft because I don't know why I don't you know, I feel like a craft is a very personal thing and it has identity tied into it. And I identify more as somebody who, I guess writes poetry or or does drawing than as someone who's a baker.  But maybe I could change my mind about myself. I don't know. That's kind of craft on poetry and drawing..  Yeah. What what would you think is your craft that could be what could it be? in craft.  Yeah, like what is your artisal thing that brings quality and quantity? I think music, music, making or listening? Making, but it's uh like if I if I would uh do something.  Yeah, music. you play piano? You're pretty good. you know. Yeah.  I'm I think I will never do this because okay. Yeah, it's okay. But uh yeah, I that something I could uh like to to craft.  I think, you know, touching it at least once a week, bringing it into your life and and feelings and feeling what you feel. You know I, uh um practice uh uh um piano lessons when I uh finished my residence because I have time down and I was thinking about uh uh following piano lessons. You know, do you have a piano that you can play at home?  Like a keyboard or's house, but Yeah. Because I feel like one of the interesting things to explore for you is how you can explore doing it with feeling more than doing it right. And my intuition is to explore the idea of improvisation.  You know what I mean? It's just like a feeling or like a guess from me to say like you looking for a teacher when you already have some technical skills, like you know how to move around, you know how to play pieces. um but this idea that we're we're looking for is the feeling side, right? You can even you can turn piano into a quantity all of it, right?  You can. You can make it about getting it right, getting it perfect, getting it, you know, and you can force yourself and you could have the hierarchy, and you could have the power, you can you know, or you can try to figure out like what helps you feel in that moment. A along with the technical, along with the rights and along you know, like you have to stay in the scale, you know, and jazz is about like doing that, but then breaking it sometimes and coming back and then learning how to how to flow, right?  It might be an interesting thing for you to explore, like what is improvisation or just feeling mean for you in music. Yeah. Yeah, but uh improvisition I think I would do just uhap you know Yeah, that's fine.  No one's listening at least, you know. We'll get you a in the piano example, uh to for me to to try to to feel the more an emotion and try to do something like uh improvisation and uh and I wanted to be still ammonious, but uh can be because I'm not uh uh neither uh thing uh emotions that I can translate into uh movements and doing a not. So we can play so this is doing advice And now he's doing this?  He's actually playing the key. And on the opposite way doing a harm many technical There's a a band okay, so two things. One is, I think it might be interesting for you to try to bring your meditation and your piano in at the same time. like we talk about like and make themgistic.  Um, you can you're only allowed two keys, okay? middle finger thumb, okay? And then you get into your meditation and just play the two keys..  Yeah. I can also already imagine it right now, you know, like so I feel like maybe there's something there, maybe three keys. I don't know, like you but limit yourself, don't think about technicality, don't think about harmony, don't think about anything.  And there's this band that's calledawn of Mid. um, which has a uh album called disnomia. Let me see if we can find it on YouTube. Yeah, here, this is the full album.  I'll just share it with you.]]]",

      "content": "From your conversation, the book you’re working on seems to have a **three-part structure**:\n\n1. **Historical Analysis:**  \n   - Investigating the shift from a worldview centered on **oneness** to one based on **division, hierarchy, and alienation**.  \n   - Key historical inflection points include:  \n     - The **Nicene Creed** and the formalization of hierarchical religious structures.  \n     - The **Black Plague** and its role in fostering **individualism** and **hedonism** as a response to mass death and suffering.  \n     - The **Hundred Years’ War** and the **Thirty Years’ War**, which secularized society further and cemented power structures.  \n   - This section answers: **Where did the sense of wholeness go? Why do we now perceive the world as fragmented?**  \n\n2. **Scientific and Psychological Exploration:**  \n   - Exploring modern cognitive science, **awe research**, and **near-death experiences** to show how humans still have access to a perception of **quality, beauty, truth, and meaning**.  \n   - Examining the **reductionist vs. holistic** paradigm—how Western thought, scientism, and capitalism focus on **quantifiable** aspects while ignoring **qualitative** experiences.  \n   - Showing how **intuition, perception of quality, and the experience of meaning** are **real, reliable faculties**, not just emotional states.  \n\n3. **Experiential Practices & Integration:**  \n   - Helping people **retrain their perception** to reconnect with meaning and wholeness.  \n   - Practices like **meditation, contemplation, and deep noticing** to cultivate an **attunement to beauty, love, and truth**.  \n   - A **coaching method** (like your \"Have To vs. Want To\" practice) to shift people's daily life from obligation-driven existence to a meaning-driven one.  \n   - The goal is not just intellectual understanding but **a lived, experiential shift** in perception and action.  \n\n---\n\n### Alternative Outlines & Ways to Structure Your Story\n\nHere are a few other structures you could experiment with:\n\n#### **1. The Hero’s Journey Approach**\nYour personal transformation can serve as a narrative backbone, making the book more **story-driven**:\n- **Call to Adventure:** Growing up with a strict interpretation of Islam and beginning to question it.  \n- **Crossing the Threshold:** Encounters with alternative perspectives (Sufi Muslims, Rastafarians, etc.).  \n- **Trials and Revelations:** Exploring history, science, and philosophy to understand how different worldviews shape human experience.  \n- **The Return:** Gaining insight into **oneness, beauty, and meaning**, and sharing it with others through practical applications.  \n\nThis version makes the book more **relatable and immersive** rather than purely theoretical.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. The Problem-Solution Approach**\nA direct, clear approach that frames the book as addressing a **deep existential crisis**:\n- **Part 1: The Crisis of Alienation** – How we lost our sense of wholeness and why we feel disconnected.  \n- **Part 2: Rediscovering the Hidden Faculty** – The science and philosophy behind perceiving meaning, love, and beauty.  \n- **Part 3: Reclaiming Meaning in Daily Life** – Practical steps for living in alignment with this perception.  \n\nThis structure makes it **actionable** for readers seeking personal transformation.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. The Parallel Histories Approach**\nExploring two competing worldviews throughout history:\n- **The Fragmented View:** How Western reductionist thought led to alienation, control, and the overemphasis on rationality.  \n- **The Unified View:** Indigenous traditions, mystical traditions, and ancient philosophies that saw the world as **relational, interconnected, and sacred**.  \n- **Bringing Them Together:** How we can integrate the strengths of both views today.  \n\nThis structure **compares and contrasts**, helping readers **see what was lost and what can be regained**.\n\n---\n\n### Other Ways to Share Your Story  \nBesides a book, you could share these ideas in multiple ways:\n- **Podcasts / Conversations:** Record deep dialogues with experts in awe research, neuroscience, philosophy, and history.  \n- **Essays / Blog Posts:** Publish shorter pieces on Medium or Substack as **chapters-in-progress** to refine ideas with audience feedback.  \n- **Interactive Retreats:** Workshops where participants experience awe, contemplation, and practical meaning-making techniques.  \n- **Documentary / Video Series:** Visually exploring these concepts—interviewing thinkers, showing historical sites, and documenting practices.  \n- **AI Chatbot / Digital Guide:** A GPT that guides people through contemplation exercises based on your framework.  \n\n---\n\n### What’s Next?  \nYou already have **an incredibly rich, interconnected framework**—the next step is **choosing the right structure** to guide the reader smoothly from historical analysis to practical transformation.\n\nWhich of these outlines resonates most with you? Or do you see a hybrid version that fits your vision?",

You did mention some earlier that I really liked. Yeah. Different ways of seeing through trust beauty, and relationship. And each theme contains elements of ways of seeing, being, doing, and having. Perception, presence, action, and outcome. Also the relationship between gifts and generosity and blessing our money. Right? Like, if you if you have something So e you eat it, but it doesn't have it's not blessed. You might survive, but you won't thrive. Until this idea of, like, a minute being an infinite amount of time spent with your loved is how time is of blessings. And a life that is blessed is a life that's worth living and worth dying. For. Right? And just worth leaving. It's okay. You've lived it. Somehow something like that. Right? Like, I feel like all of these ideas are trying to get at something that's almost Ineffable. And I'm wondering what, like, the core word can be that Helps structure all the patterns and organizes them most coherently, elegantly, and simply. So that the frameworks look clean and are comprehensible. And also, our practical. And really transformative for businesses. And through those businesses transformative for the world. I mean, the idea is that people transformed people, people coming to work with meaning in moment. Are are, like, off gassing beauty. Because people that are living a meaningful life are perfuming the air. Around them There's just glowing, if you will. And It's very unlikely that they will be doing anything as a D service. And it's because we glow when we are in service to something greater than us, something more beautiful. And as you seek that, That's So what of transforming and continually leveling in your understanding of self and world and in what you Can do as you devote more skills and awareness and understanding of systems and This is how we start wherever we are and slowly become more and more of You know? Integrated whole into larger and larger feeling how it all interconnects, and listening to the signals of how to respond but not needing a spreadsheet to keep it all in order because you are there. You are the response. And Weird. The response and serving life, life supports that which serves life. And so you will make your living. And so that is how you can understand that your provisions have already My god. When you are in service, when you are Completely get you will get Because You are in the system of life. This is not a system of death. Even the death and decay in the collapse is a part of new life. When you let go of who you are and what you think should happen, I want to live forever. You become a cancer on this earth. Rather than thinking of the generous life. And you see animals and plants and you don't think, like, poor tree has mushrooms growing out of Oh, gross.

And that I also want it to align with the Islamic principle service and falling holy in service and I like the idea of, like, beauty is witnessing, and recognizing the beauty of the natural order and wanting to align to that and to your fitra. Right? And So already need that full dispensation. And that we are here to do that. Until doing it in a way that is proper. And we're told how. Best to be in beauty just like everything else, like animals had returned to that state. And involves things like interest is like stretching the future towards you and creating these spring like ripple effect with your greed, wanting more now. And time traveling into the future rather than being in the present. And that sort of time traveling creates warps where you're not in mode. In the moment. Lost in desiring more of later. Because you want things faster, but what if you die? You'll never you'll you then like a rope tied to you through a spring. We'll cut it, and we'll create jiggle and ripple effects throughout the system. This is why interest and wanting and desiring more than you can offer in service. Holistically and completely right now. And to create a value right now. Pretending or hoping or desiring that this job or this school or this business will be able to come in the future is a lie against reality because many only exists in this present. Live reality.

Like, I Claude my business node creative studio with node co op. And it's about the light of God coming and hitting the earth. Causing things to grow, and that it's our sort of task to take that and be as careful as possible with the blessings that are full in every moment and every second because it's our hands that can corrupt them. Like an apple that grows on a tree in a field is full of delicious beauty and generous generosity from God who's in constant giving inside of the core of the earth. With the heat and the outside of the sun coming in lighting up the sky and the moon and the the seasons and all the cycles that Move and propel minerals and material and story to produce an apple that you can eat and digest and incorporate into your body versus you know, you go and all of that is happening. But God blessed it to grow and the land of your neighbor. And you sneak over and you steal it. And you eat it. That stuff is not gonna be good for you.

And the things that I woke up being inspired by today was realizing that, there's a relationship between seeing everything as part of a whole and instrumental. Right? Like, if you Think of something as a means the end is always God. And how is that an instrument? Using God for God. As God, is God. Right? Like, it really changes the dynamic The only instrument can be towards the fleeting, the death of the action in the self Right? So you think of Someone stealing something. Right? From who and then to who? Essentially, what the crime here is the lack of acknowledgment of relationality or the togetherness. And I use the word relationality because I'm starting realize that relationship itself is Zocor. Drawn through love, and beauty as a recognition, of oneness knowing that how amazing it is to be alive and that we didn't do it and that this comes from the emergence of this unity. As Muslims would say, everything is under the mercy of God. Then relating is an integrative process of putting together oneness. It is the Active practice. T A wh I d, Tawhid in the Muslim tradition. And so Any work or any action that we take that is counter to relating or breaks ties One of the biggest quote unquote sins in the Muslim relationship is breaking the ties of kinship. Right. And that is Any way of thinking about relating that makes it about Putting things together as one For instance, like, let's say you went and you bought lighter That item will mostly contain yourself in it. I went to the store. Abstract concept. Android used money and I purchased an item. For my need. It's all inward. Versus going to the store. Or to the crafts person. Seeing their crafts witnessing their beauty, sharing time and experience honoring a lineage of Android and thousands of people. Potentially. Who have refined that craft. In some traditions, they keep a record of the history of the grass people. I learned this master who learned from this master who learned from this master. And weaving together materiality and the world and the object and the thing that you bring to your home. You know? Versus I saw this rug on Amazon. It looked cute. And it's very similar to the superficial falling in love versus the deep falling in love. Right? This person is attractive. I desire. I want. Versus we are in love. You know? And So these ideas of stories of connection of is thanks. Are so core because then it's It's very different even, like, in a macroeconomic way. Like, tariffs versus taxes versus You know? Imposing bans on one country or another. Is like saying that people can't fall in love And Yeah. So this idea of, like, relationships being are so critical as a form of Tohid? And love kind of. Maybe you can think of it as the gravitational force. That pulls things into relationships, and you can love an object because of the beauty you can love an object even more because of the story And beauty is A way of witnessing that it is like the story of the farmer trying to get a cow into their you know, garage. And he's pushing the cow and trying to pull the cow into the barn and just struggling, and the car's very stubborn. And then the car's wave comes. Puts out her hand, and lets the cow suck on her thumb, and walks into the farm. I feel like another sign of god's infinite mercy is that truth is decorated in beauty. And we're drawn towards it. And I believe if we tell a beautiful story about an economic future, then that is about integration and connection and meaning. And You know, it's not confusing that meaninglessness is such a sickness of our age and loneliness. And isolation and fear and anxiety because we are surrounded by dead objects. With no story. And no connection, And even fewer people. And Yeah. Let's see how these ideas come into our emerging design and I'm kind of yeah. I'd like to see where we go from here.EditCORE FRAMEWORK: RELATIONALITY AS TAWHID (Unity Through Active Integration)\nCopyWITNESSING UNITY\n(Beauty as Recognition)\n         ↓\nLOVE as Force → RELATION as Practice → INTEGRATION as Outcome\n(Drawing Together) (Active Connection)    (Living Unity)\n         ↓\nBARAKA as Flowering\n(Grace Through Connection)\nKey Understanding:\n\nEvery transaction is potentially sacred connection\nEvery object carries story and lineage\nEvery action either integrates or fragments\nBeauty draws us toward unity\nLove is the force of integration\nBaraka flows through relationship\n\nStories Present:\n\nThe Cow and Thumb\nTheme: Love as natural integrative force\nLesson: Beauty and gentleness accomplish what force cannot\nCraft Lineage\nTheme: Objects as containers of relationship\nLesson: Deep vs. superficial connection\nAmazon vs. Craftsperson\nTheme: Transaction vs. Relationship\nLesson: Integration through story and presence\n\nSupporting Concepts Reframed:\n\nINSTRUMENTAL VS.

Should we explore specific examples of how this looks in practice? CopyRetryBGYou say that every way of thinking is powerful. Every emphasis is powerful and amazing and the best thing ever. And I want some harsh critique Let's look at all of the different ways that we found themes and patterns and frameworks and you know, like, some of the ones that I liked When we were talking about different know, entry points and talking about, Yeah. Meta patterns of movements and power intersections and Boundaries and discernment and we had a lot going. Practice integration map. Finding new meetings. Maintain boundaries, Curious, like, how do I even move forward from here? I've seeing all these possibilities. Can you give series of insights as to all the different ways of framing a book that we've described so far and all of the ways of Framing the main patterns and then 3 deep questions with Some parts that really Help us integrate and determine a better path forward.EditMAJOR FRAMEWORKS WE'VE EXPLORED:\n\nLove-Beauty-Truth Framework\nStrengths:\n\n\nClear triadic structure\nUniversal recognition\nPractical application\nWeaknesses:\nCould be seen as abstract\nMight lack economic rigor\nBeauty could be misunderstood as superficial\n\n\nHarmony/Music Framework\nStrengths:\n\n\nDynamic metaphor\nShows integration\nCaptures timing\nWeaknesses:\nCould feel too poetic for business\nMight not address hard economic questions\nRisk of being too metaphorical\n\n\nUnity/Tawhid Framework\nStrengths:\n\n\nPhilosophically deep\nAddresses root causes\nShows integration\nWeaknesses:\nMight be too religious/abstract for some\nCould miss practical business needs\nRisk of being too theoretical\n\n\nBaraka as Multiplication Framework\nStrengths:\n\n\nUnique perspective\nCombines spiritual/practical\nClear outcomes\nWeaknesses:\nConcept might be hard to grasp\nCould seem magical/unrealistic\nMight not address systemic issues\n\nCRITICAL GAPS IN ALL FRAMEWORKS:\n\nEconomic Rigor\n\n\nHow do these actually transform business?\nWhat about hard metrics?\nHow to handle real constraints?\n\n\nPractical Implementation\n\n\nStep-by-step guidance needed\nClear metrics missing\nTransition paths unclear\n\n\nSystemic Change\n\n\nIndividual vs collective change unclear\nPower dynamics not addressed\nStructural barriers not confronted\n\nTHREE DEEP QUESTIONS:\n\nThe Integration Question:\n\"How can we maintain both spiritual depth and practical applicability without diluting either?

The frameworks are elegant but could mask practical challenges.\nDo these critical perspectives help clarify next steps? What aspects need deeper examination? CopyRetryBGOkay. So we have love, beauty, and truth. Scene is quite abstract. Harmonia and music. Dynamic metaphor. I kind of like the day night The yin and the yang, the approach retreat the love, the fear, and that kind of duality that creates these dynamic tensions and that tension be called the third thing. And then the third thing can be called the movement. That creates movements. Right? America has multiple Location. Connecticut. Is the multiplication Is When you when you embed it in something because of doing it in the right way, for the right reasons God places Bettecan something and so it becomes more than what it is. Yeah. I'd like to figure out the economic rigor If you can help me Extrapolate from the principles to the and imagine what Could happen undo that, that would be awesome. And then move on to well then, how do we practically do that? And then the systemic change part. As well. I'd like to talk about power dynamics we talked about parallel economies, you know, not necessarily needing to overthrow the current structures. And structural barriers as well as, like, who is this really for? I think maybe there's a theory and then the practical you know, I want to run workshops with businesses and, support new entrepreneurs to create a new parallel economy of meaning and relationship and connection and beauty and craft, including the craft of studying Technology business. A craft is not just wood and stone. It's a way of approaching The world and reviewing the process and This stuff. Of your business, including the people and the ideas and seeing even ideas as the gift. To honor. Because where do they come from? How can we maintain both spiritual death and practical life? Ability without diluting either I think we do that by making the spiritual depth be an experiential reality for agnostics for atheists alike. With Muslims and people that believe by guiding them through thought experiments that help them Thought experiments and action because oftentimes it's really in the lived experience. Where the belief form. So that experiments in action that helped them No. That specific element. And so it might be interesting to have sort of, like, the axioms page in a mathematical document. Where these are the things you need to believe for this book. To be true. And if you don't hear the practices, And know, there's a guide in there's a workshop or a a book of guidance to help you experience and Reflect and First of all, also help us deepen our understanding because we don't know the truth of things. But we believe that this has been experientially proven by many mistakes from many traditions and many people who accept the existence of an inward reality. And so we would like you to know that as well. The only difference in our scientific method is that we take inner perception as true and we verify that through many people. So the more people that go through these experiences and workshops, the more true it becomes. The more clearly true from more people. And then maybe even the more trustable it becomes for people who don't have time or desire to pursue the science of The thought experiment. Bridge between vision and practice. Think frameworks and processes and community and encouragement. Help people take their vision and turn it into something real. Measure success while honoring immeasurables. I mean, we we call success being every step Because There is self confidence, integrity, values, and the fact that knowing that if we live like this, Tomorrow is possible and beautiful. Then even if you fail as a business, you did the right thing. So maybe success isn't about succeeding. It's about making a steak and a claim for the right way of doing things and finding the people that appreciate that figuring out your market size from there. And your business. And before going big and hiring a ton of people and investing a lot of money, Walking into that, a tree, doesn't just show up as a tree. It starts as a seed. And so even our businesses, is it possible to do it? In a way that proves psychological viability in the total landscape. Over a long period of time, something that you know, just like we can craft a knife it's beautiful because our children can inherit it. Can we craft a business? In the same way that it isn't? A flash in the pan. But something that has ecological viability and depth that can be passed forward. How do these frameworks actually create change? Many seem to describe ideal states without clear paths to reach them. Yeah. So I guess there's the Islam, Iman, Hassan process. Right? So you could start at Claude talk about living in the light of God and you can also start at Islam and say, what you must do. Pray like this. Do this. And for children and for people that are still not You know, able to even understand what it means to live in the light of God as if he sees you. Or really have had the time to Foundationally, transform their beliefs and experientially understand and belief in God and angels and the afterlife and heaven and hell and determination and god's, you know, predestined, plan. Then we can work. With people that are just need the steps. Right? And so go and and pray. I'll go in here's a You know, but, like, a business model canvas. And people that wanna be inspired, they started over there, but, foundational, we need to also transform beliefs. Is it really because of where people are that we need to kind of take them and guide them through the other. Parts. How do these frameworks address real world constraints and challenges? Yeah. I think I don't have a great answer for this, Start small. Find something that works. Don't You know? Mortgage the house or, you know, take too much risk. Find something that has a flow of real money and relationship and life supports that which supports life. And if it doesn't support, it might wither. You know? You plant a 100 seeds and maybe if you fail. So it's really focus on doing the right thing answering the call. As being, you know, all the forces at play that are inspiring you to do things certain way meaningful And if you answer it, in integrity and validity and truth, something good will come.EditCORE DYNAMIC STRUCTURE:\n\nThe Tension-Movement Framework\n\nCopyDAY         →     NIGHT\n(Outer)           (Inner)\nAction            Reflection\nGrowth            Integration\n     ↓                ↓\n    MOVEMENT through BARAKA\n    (Multiplication through Grace)\nECONOMIC RIGOR DEVELOPMENT:\n\nMultiple Forms of Capital with Baraka Lens:\n\n\nFinancial Capital → Blessed provision\nSocial Capital → Deep relationships\nCultural Capital → Meaningful traditions\nSpiritual Capital → Divine connection\nMaterial Capital → Sacred resources\nLiving Capital → Life-giving systems\n\n\nBusiness Model Evolution:\n\nCopyTraditional         →        Baraka-Based\nROI                         Multiple Returns\nGrowth Metrics              Blessing Metrics\nMarket Size                 Relationship Depth\nScale Fast                  Grow Organically\n\nPractical Implementation Framework:\n\nLevel 1: FOUNDATION (Islam - Actions)\n\nBasic practices\nSimple tools\nClear guidelines\nBusiness model canvas\nInitial steps\n\nLevel 2: UNDERSTANDING (Iman - Beliefs)\n\nThought experiments\nExperiential learning\nCommunity practice\nDeeper principles\nMarket testing\n\nLevel 3: EXCELLENCE (Ihsan - Beauty)\n\nAdvanced integration\nSystem transformation\nLeadership development\nCommunity building\nLegacy creation\n\nPRACTICAL WORKSHOP STRUCTURE:\n\nExperience First\n\n\nConcrete exercises\nReal business examples\nImmediate application\nTangible results\n\n\nPrinciple Recognition\n\n\nPattern identification\nConcept introduction\nFramework understanding\nTheory integration\n\n\nImplementation Support\n\n\nCommunity building\nOngoing guidance\nResource sharing\nProgress tracking\n\nECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION PATH:\n\nStart Small\n\n\nTest market\nBuild relationships\nProve viability\nGather evidence\n\n\nGrow Organically\n\n\nFollow natural rhythm\nRespond to real needs\nBuild capacity\nDeepen roots\n\n\nScale Through Multiplication\n\n\nTrain others\nShare knowledge\nBuild networks\nCreate ecosystems\n\nMEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK:\n\nProcess Metrics\n\n\nRelationship quality\nDecision integrity\nValue alignment\nCommunity impact\n\n\nOutcome Metrics\n\n\nMultiple capitals growth\nBlessing multiplication\nSystem health\nLegacy building\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop specific workshop exercises?\nCreate detailed implementation guides?\nDesign measurement tools?\n\nThis framework attempts to:\n\nHonor both action and reflection\nProvide clear steps while maintaining depth\nAddress practical needs while preserving spirit\nCreate measurable outcomes while respecting immeasurables\nBuild from foundation to excellence\n\nThe key seems to be creating experiences that reveal truth while providing practical tools for implementation. Should we develop specific examples of how this works in practice? CopyRetryBGYeah. But it seems like we're missing a lot of other patterns and themes and attentional policies that we pulled out initially. Right? Like, we have the Core themes identified being day and night, sacred economics, technology at human scale, beauty as an economic principle, gift economics, You know? Multiple forms of capital, which we have generational change in hope, returning to traditional wisdom, trust in the divine providence, environmental stewardship, appropriate scale and pacing, communal wealth building, innovation with wisdom, and business as worship. And the meta themes are like beauty as a guide, I think relationship over transaction iOS something we have integration of the sacred and the secular. Appropriate pacing, and, Being annoying. As Breaking 0 to some thinking. Economics of wholeness. Yeah. These things are interesting. Right? Where do they fit? In we're doing right now Can you give, like, 3 different Models. That make sure not to, like, miss any as mermaid diagrams. And then tell me, like, what are you what are all the different things that you're noticing right, that you mentioned. Pattern around transformational personal and organizational and societal. Noticing connections between these themes. Beauty serves as both measure and method. I think that's kind of 2. Gifts economics naturally emerge from trust. Yeah. Let's start with that.

Let's explore how these they serve different purposes or audiences. And then what we're trying to do is put it into booked. As well and have the book be the starting point. Right?

You think book 1 model 1 being Transformational journey from business leaders. Yeah. So what's wrong with that little thing? The only it missing important elements? I mean, besides this structure, it looks like model 2 is should be, like, workshops in model 3. It can be, like, the why the what, and the how. Right?

Should we focus on developing the single book first, making sure it contains the essential elements while pointing to deeper resources? CopyRetryBGYeah. Somehow, I don't like that first line, but economics. Reveals how Islamic wisdom, a divine blessing of a revolutionary framework for business. Like, it doesn't feel powerful to me. It doesn't feel interesting. So can we do that again? Okay. Maybe compare it with conscious capitalism and regenerative businesses because I'm worried that I'm just, like, rehashing ideas We're coming to them myself from my own understanding. Seeing a new understanding, Yeah. That's kinda interesting. Although I don't see it as complete. Like What forms capital, gift dynamic, Right scale. It's Agro technology. Creating beauty, I don't see the importance of relationships. For me, like, you know, the story of the Turkish people who were in front of their shops and, they are put out a chair And if they make their first sale They pulled the chair back in. And if someone is about to buy from a shop and he notices that his neighbor hasn't you know, pulled in his chair, indicated that he's made his first see a little then he directs his customer to his neighbor and this idea like competition different. It's you you want to succeed for sure, but you also want your neighbor to succeed and that I think indicates practice of oneness making that is so important that is not really present And this, framework. The art of multiplication of business, I don't like it. Like, I think there's something weird about that. If you wanna call it funny math, that's funny. And good, but I not sure why I bet again multiplication. Doesn't sound good to me. It doesn't feel right. Yeah. Let's develop a single book further and explore what to integrate. It can be an entry point, but it should be rigorous and interesting, and it should have at least one Unique. Thing that isn't in regenerative or you know, conscious Capitalism. Can you tell me what you think the most important thing is? That makes it distinct.EditWHAT MAKES THIS TRULY DISTINCT:\nThe Core Difference: Integration as Active Worship\nUnlike conscious capitalism or regenerative business, this isn't just about being ethical or sustainable - it's about seeing business as an active practice of recognizing and creating unity (tawhid). The Turkish shop example perfectly illustrates this: success isn't individual, it's communal, because reality isn't fragmented.\nLet me try a different pitch:\n\"Business isn't just about transactions or even relationships - it's about actively recognizing and creating unity. This book shows how traditional wisdom about beauty, trust, and divine grace can transform how we work, challenging the myth that competition and self-interest drive success. Through stories like Turkish shopkeepers ensuring their neighbors succeed before themselves, we explore how business can be a practice of witnessing and creating wholeness, leading to natural abundance that benefits everyone.\"\nUNIQUE ELEMENTS not found in other frameworks:\n\nUnity as Active Practice\n\n\nBusiness as way of seeing oneness\nCompetition transformed through unity\nSuccess as collective flowering\n\n\nBeauty as Recognition\n\n\nBeauty as sign of alignment\nAesthetic guidance in business\nQuality over quantity\n\n\nDivine Grace in Commerce\n\n\nTrust enabling generosity\nPresent abundance over future extraction\nBlessing through right relationship\n\nThis suggests a different structure:\nTitle: \"Beautiful Business: The Art of Creating Unity Through Commerce\"\n(or \"Barakanomics: Where Business Meets Beauty\")\nPart 1: SEEING DIFFERENTLY\n\nThe Myth of Separation\nThe Reality of Unity\nBeauty as Guide\n\nPart 2: THE WAY OF UNITY\n\nTrust Enables Generosity\nCompetition Serves Community\nTechnology Serves Life\nScale Honors Relationship\n\nPart 3: THE PRACTICE\n\nStarting with Beauty\nBuilding Trust\nCreating Community\nMeasuring What Matters\n\nPart 4: THE TRANSFORMATION\n\nPersonal: From Transaction to Relation\nBusiness: From Extraction to Generation\nCommunity: From Competition to Flourishing\nEconomy: From Scarcity to Grace\n\nWhat Makes This Different:\n\nNot just about being conscious or regenerative\nNot just about Islamic finance\nNot just about social enterprise\nAbout transforming how we see and create unity through business\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop this structure further?\nExplore more unique examples like the Turkish shopkeepers?\nCreate a detailed chapter outline?\n\nThe key insight seems to be that this isn't just another framework for \"better business\" - it's about seeing and creating unity through commerce, with specific practices and examples that challenge fundamental assumptions about competition, success, and value.\nThis feels more distinctive than the previous versions. Does this better capture what makes your approach unique? CopyRetryBG Yeah. Maybe that's one way if you can frame it. Like, integration is active worship. Right. You wanna call it something else, you can talk about life supporting that which supports life. We can bring up the evidence of calculus being invented at the same time in 2 different places because the forces that play in the universe and the conversation that were happening across time and space meant that that was the time for that to be born. And if we're attuned to these things, just like you know, Mary Gilbert talks about how she had an idea for a book 4 she acted on it. Somebody else wrote it. And it's because it was out And in been waiting The you can call it God. You can call it, like, all the forces that play and more we're connected and in relationship with self, with the world, with each other, with what wants to naturally and dynamically flow through us and We have a self and a business can have a self. What naturally wants to flow through that business and that structure, and we can refine ourself. And we can also refine our businesses And when it serves beauty, and it serves life, I think that's a real business. Has real impact and lasting power creativity and innovation and this is why people get, like, Businesses, like, especially when I had Steve Jobs. Waiting Apple only. There was a big component of the founder and they businesses have really important Connections to story of the founder and I think that's an interesting to to to note and, like, what happens when it becomes this abstract Like, is it possible for Apple is very possible to be a craft. Maybe the culture has preserved preserved some of that. And there are, like, new people that have been drawn to it and the The form inspirational, like, uniqueness of of Steve Jobs, like, vision and how important Vision is because it's, like, that's where the imparting of the self into the the DNA of the business takes place. Right? Not about transactions or relationships. It's about recognizing creating unity. That sounds super abstract and random. I can only make it more concrete. Yeah. So, like, if unity is the core, then Business of 1. I I like this idea of, like, mind your own business really. Like mindfulness, but it's really that important, but I thought it was funny. As you can see, fun and playful is also important to me. Where business meets beauty. Yeah. And maybe we could start with beauty and, like, What is duty? How is it related to oneness? And relationship? And kind of you know, how there's, like, one name of god and then mercy fragments out. 2, All the things, and then you see through all the things back to and the what relationships and storytelling can be all about. It's like process of returning to wholeness. And the more we disintegrate, and see cells and other in competition as other and world as a resource to extract extract from where and to where. Right? Think it's really interesting and have a lot of the impacts people are seeking in business without having it be a And I think that's, like, one of the other things like being versus doing Can we have businesses? Even though that's where we work, be a place of becoming and rather than doing because Being resting in you know, sales. I'm here to be relational and connect. I'm innovation. I'm here. As a ear for what wants to emerge, eyes that see, potential sensing Hearing And even I like doing connecting it to craft, rhythm, pattern, tradition, honoring lineage, All these things, I think, are so important. Yeah. Like, work is worship, I think. Right? But how can that be agnostic? It can be like work. I mean, if I write meaning at work, people won't really understand what I'm trying to say. But becoming at work. Business as becoming, Business as being. Why your perception of beauty matters? I don't know. Do you think?EditNEW PITCH ATTEMPT:\n\"What if business isn't something we do, but something we become? Like a craftsperson attuned to their material, or an artist sensing what wants to emerge, business can be a practice of deep attention and natural unfolding. Through stories like calculus being discovered simultaneously or the Turkish shopkeepers' chair ritual, we see how attunement to life's natural patterns creates success that serves everyone. This book shows how businesses can become living expressions of beauty and purpose, rather than just machines for profit.\"\nPOTENTIAL TITLES:\n\"Business as Being: The Art of Natural Unfolding\"\n\"The Living Business: Where Beauty Meets Purpose\"\n\"Attuned: The Art of Business as Becoming\"\nStructure Around Being/Becoming:\nPart 1: SEEING\n\nBeauty as Recognition\nStories of Attunement (calculus, Jobs, craftspeople)\nWhen Business Comes Alive\n\nPart 2: BEING\n\nFrom Doing to Becoming\nThe Art of Attention\nFinding Your Flow\nStories that Shape Us\n\nPart 3: BECOMING\n\nNatural Unfolding\nRhythm and Pattern\nCommunity and Connection\nLiving Innovation\n\nPart 4: FLOWERING\n\nWhen Business Serves Life\nNatural Abundance\nBeautiful Legacy\nFuture Unfolding\n\nKey Distinctions from Other Frameworks:\n\nFocus on being/becoming vs doing\nAttunement vs strategy\nNatural unfolding vs forced growth\nLiving expression vs mechanical system\n\nCore Stories to Feature:\n\nTurkish shopkeepers' chair ritual\nCalculus simultaneous discovery\nGilbert's book idea timing\nJobs and Apple's DNA\nTraditional craft lineages\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop how \"being\" translates to practical business decisions?\nExplore more stories that illustrate natural unfolding?\nCreate a detailed chapter showing how this works?\n\nThis framing feels more:\n\nConcrete through stories\nUniversal while maintaining depth\nFocused on natural emergence\nTrue to your vision\nDistinct from other approaches\n\nThe key seems to be showing how attention and attunement create natural success, rather than prescribing methods or frameworks. Does this better capture what you're trying to convey? CopyRetryBGYeah. It's not pretty good except it doesn't connect to some of the core foundational things like Unity And the multiple forms. Of capital and the gift dynamic and Having your work being blessed. I guess that happens when you are attuned. Right? And the blessings come because you're doing the quote unquote right thing. The thing that is being Claude from your and it's connected to the word of vocation. It kind of returns business idea of vocation. And I like some of these sound references because we can kind of loop in the singing with the universe stuff. Yeah. Do you think? I think we're onto something, but can you tell me the things that I'm not seeing? You know, Can you tell me, like, what we're circling around but not looking at?EditWHAT WE'RE CIRCLING AROUND:\n\nSacred Resonance\nWe keep coming back to \"singing with the universe\" and attunement, but what we're really describing is:\n\n\nHow business can be a form of sacred listening\nWhen work aligns with divine patterns\nThe \"music\" that emerges from right relationship\nHow blessing flows when we're \"in tune\"\n\n\nThe Unity Paradox\nWe haven't fully articulated how:\n\n\nIndividual vocation serves collective harmony\nCompetition can strengthen unity (Turkish shopkeepers)\nMultiple forms of capital reflect one source\nGift economics emerges from understanding oneness\n\n\nThe Living Pattern\nSomething about:\n\n\nBusiness as living entity vs mechanism\nHow blessing/baraka is the \"life force\" in commerce\nThe organic nature of true vocation\nThe difference between \"making\" business and letting it grow\n\nMISSING CONNECTIONS:\n\nBetween Attunement and Multiple Capitals\n\nCopyATTUNEMENT\n    ↓\nRecognizes → Different Forms → of Same Reality\n    ↓\nMULTIPLE CAPITALS\n\nBetween Vocation and Gift\n\nCopyCALLING (Vocation)\n    ↓\nNatural Response → Creates Gift → Generates Blessing\n    ↓\nMULTIPLICATION\n\nBetween Unity and Practice\n\nCopyUNITY\n    ↓\nSeen Through → Beauty → Practiced Through → Business\n    ↓\nMANIFESTATION\nPerhaps what we're really exploring is:\nHow Business Becomes Sacred Practice:\n\nThrough deep listening (attunement)\nThrough right relationship (unity)\nThrough natural response (vocation)\nThrough generous flow (gift)\nThrough beautiful expression (craft)\n\nThis suggests a possible structure:\n\"The Sacred Pattern in Business: Finding Your Place in Life's Unfolding\"\nPart 1: LISTENING\n\nThe Pattern of Life\nThe Nature of Calling\nThe Art of Attention\n\nPart 2: RESPONDING\n\nFrom Calling to Vocation\nFrom Transaction to Gift\nFrom Separation to Unity\n\nPart 3: FLOWING\n\nWith Natural Rhythm\nThrough Right Relationship\nIn Beautiful Expression\n\nPart 4: MULTIPLYING\n\nHow Blessing Flows\nHow Communities Grow\nHow Future Unfolds\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore these deeper patterns further?\nShow how they connect to practical aspects?\nDevelop new frameworks based on these insights?\n\nKey Questions:\n\nIs \"sacred pattern\" too abstract?\nHow do we show rather than tell?\nWhat stories best illustrate these connections?\n\nI'm sensing that we're circling around something like \"sacred commerce\" but that term doesn't capture the living, dynamic quality you're describing. The key might be showing how business can be a way of participating in life's natural unfolding when we're properly attuned.\nDoes this help identify what we've been circling around? CopyRetryBGYeah. I think it's pretty good except the idea of sacred merili. Like, talk about things for a spiritual audience. I just wanna want tell people that this is true and that we need the experience to really Go through these thought experiments to understand the foundations reality. And it would be natural. Like a natural business or something like that. Another element is the idea of that we came to that having meaning be a guide by living our values and coming to life in our business, as a measure and a way to make success. At every step. Nearly talk about, you know, most businesses fail. But even And failure if you've become the process of starting and working on the business and And there's no failure becoming My identifying your growth, your patterns, your listening, becoming a a Servant of the beautiful doula to bring it forth Like, these are really wonderful things. It would be a life well lived. And I'm trying to suggest as well that, like, these businesses kind of in aggregate frame our societies because they connect to the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Right? Like, how do we get our food? How do we get our security? How do we get all of these things? Our society structures, these things are on businesses. We don't have tribes where you know, this person goes and harvest, and this person defends the borders. And of our tribe and is on the lookout for wild animals or whatever iOS, like, we are we have put that into the hands of business, but Before, it used to be way more relational. And now it's imagined possible to do it as transaction. But we can bring business back to life. Put the heart back into it. Putting people in them that operate from a place of being. And I think there's some information here that I think can help you think the opposite and don't call it sacred. Like, what's another way of saying these things. Come up with 5 different ways I'd have 2 of them use the word better economics inside of it.Edit\n\"Living Business: Where Meaning Meets Markets\"\nSubtitle: \"How Attunement Creates Natural Success\"\nCore idea: Business as living system, naturally growing when aligned with life's patterns\n\"Barakanomics: The Art of Natural Multiplication\"\nSubtitle: \"Where Business Comes Alive\"\nCore idea: How blessing flows when business serves life's natural unfolding\n\"The Relational Economy: Business as Becoming\"\nSubtitle: \"From Transaction to Transformation\"\nCore idea: How business can return to its natural role in human flourishing\n\"Barakanomics: Where Work Becomes Alive\"\nSubtitle: \"A Natural Approach to Business and Value\"\nCore idea: How meaning and attunement create natural abundance\n\"Natural Business: The Pattern of Life in Commerce\"\nSubtitle: \"How Meaning Makes Markets Flourish\"\nCore idea: Business as expression of life's natural patterns of relationship and growth\n\nLet me develop one of these fully to see how it works:\n\"Natural Business: The Pattern of Life in Commerce\"\nPart 1: SEEING LIFE IN BUSINESS\n\nHow Business Shapes Society\nWhen Markets Were Relationships\nThe Return to Natural Patterns\n\nPart 2: THE WAY OF ATTUNEMENT\n\nFinding Your Natural Response\nLearning to Listen\nGrowing Through Relationship\nThe Art of Timing\n\nPart 3: NATURAL PRACTICE\n\nStarting from Meaning\nGrowing with Purpose\nMeasuring What Matters\nSuccess in Becoming\n\nPart 4: NATURAL ABUNDANCE\n\nHow Value Multiplies\nHow Communities Flourish\nHow Future Unfolds\nLiving Legacy\n\nKey Arguments:\n\nBusiness shapes how society meets basic needs\nNatural patterns create sustainable success\nMeaning guides growth\nRelationship generates abundance\nThere's no failure in becoming\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop another version of these frameworks?\nCreate detailed chapter outlines?\nExplore specific examples and stories?\n\nThis framing tries to:\n\nKeep the depth while being accessible\nShow practical implications\nConnect to fundamental human needs\nReveal natural patterns\nInspire transformation\n\nDoes any of these directions feel closer to what you're envisioning?

And Let's Like, are you For 1 and another in dialogue kind of back and forth suggesting which one would be the most meaningful book that I could write for myself and in that, I would be answering the call that wants to flow through me rather than thinking about, like, what would be the most marketable or what was the most important thing to say or which one has not been said before, I think. For me, I I actually practice what I preach, and let's try it. Right.

      "content": "Below is a **birds-eye summary** of all the core frameworks and title/subtitle ideas we’ve discussed, plus a final **proposed structure** that most closely aligns with what you’ve been describing as meaningful to you. I’ve also woven in your **attention policies** to keep the book grounded and specific.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Review of Major Frameworks\n\nWe’ve explored **many** angles on what your book could be:\n\n1. **Love–Beauty–Truth (LBT) Framework**  \n   - **Strengths:** Clear triadic structure; universal recognition of love, beauty, truth.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Can be seen as too abstract; needs stronger “business” tie-in.\n\n2. **Harmony / Music Metaphor**  \n   - **Strengths:** Captures dynamic tension (like day/night, yin/yang), synergy, timing.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Risk of being too poetic, lacking concrete business methods.\n\n3. **Tawhid / Oneness / Unity**  \n   - **Strengths:** Deep Islamic root, addresses root cause (separation vs. wholeness).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Potentially niche or “too theological” for a broader readership; can stay theoretical without hands-on examples.\n\n4. **Baraka / Multiplication**  \n   - **Strengths:** Unique Islamic concept; underscores “beyond mere math”—quality > quantity.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** “Multiplication” can sound too magical; still needs more tangible business grounding.\n\n5. **Being / Becoming / Attunement**  \n   - **Strengths:** Conveys experiential depth—work as worship, presence over transaction.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Can drift into “spiritual self-help” if not anchored in concrete how-tos.\n\n6. **Natural Business**  \n   - **Strengths:** Emphasizes organic growth, living systems, supportive relationships.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Could feel too broad; “natural” can be vague.\n\n7. **Sacred Commerce**  \n   - **Strengths:** Clear spiritual anchor; references known tradition (“Sacred Commerce”).  \n   - **Weaknesses:** May alienate purely secular readers; not fully capturing your angles on beauty, craft, stories.\n\nAfter circling around, you found yourself returning to:\n\n- **Beauty** as a guiding thread (it “decorates the truth” and attracts us to unity).  \n- **Relationship / Relationality** as the active practice of oneness.  \n- **Meaning / Attunement** as the experiential key to doing business in a “living” way.  \n- **Stories of craft, lineage, timing, love** that make these principles tangible and practical.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Revisiting Your Core Attention Policies\n\nFrom all our conversation, these **Attentional Policies** have emerged as crucial:\n\n1. **MOMENTS** where beauty reveals unity in what looks separated.  \n2. **OPPORTUNITIES** to transform transactions into genuine human relationships.  \n3. **CHOICES** that align business with deeper meaning or sever it from meaning.  \n4. **STORIES** of lineage, craft, community, and how these weave us together.  \n5. **RELATIONSHIPS** that show business can be an act of service and unity, not just profit.  \n6. **RHYTHMS** that honor both outward action (day) and inward reflection (night).  \n7. **SENSATIONS** that indicate we’re “in tune” (flow, blessing) or out of tune (forced, fragmenting).\n\nYou’ve also highlighted the importance of:\n\n- **Multiple forms of capital** (financial, spiritual, social, cultural, living, etc.).  \n- **Islamic-inflected wisdom** (baraka, tawhid, trust, the Turkish-shopkeeper style “neighbor-first” ethic).  \n- **Practical business** scaffolding (we can’t just stay in abstractions).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Three Example Book Constellations\n\nWe looked at potential **“series”** approaches:\n\n1. **The Transformational Journey (Model 1)**  \n   - \\[“Barakanomics: From Transaction to Transformation”\\]  \n   - Pros: Inspires business leaders. Cons: May still need more hands-on tools.\n\n2. **Practical Implementation (Model 2)**  \n   - \\[“Beautiful Business: A Guide to Baraka-Based Enterprise”\\]  \n   - Pros: “How-to” flavor. Cons: Might lack the deeper philosophical core you love.\n\n3. **The Wisdom Journey (Model 3)**  \n   - \\[“The Economics of Unity: A Baraka Framework”\\]  \n   - Pros: Depth, theology/philosophy. Cons: Possibly too niche or heady.\n\nYou can **merge these** into one volume or a “main book + companion workbook + deeper dive” set.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. A Proposed “Single Book” Structure\n\nBelow is one **holistic structure** that incorporates:\n\n- **Beauty** as the gateway\n- **Relationship** as the active practice\n- **Meaning & Attunement** as the foundation\n- **Concrete stories** (Turkish shopkeeper, personal journey, craft lineages, etc.)\n- **Enough practical bite** for business readers\n\n### Working Title Ideas\n\n- **“Beautiful Business: Weaving Meaning and Markets with Baraka”**  \n- **“Barakanomics: Building Businesses That Serve Life and Spark Meaning”**  \n- **“Business as Becoming: The Way of Beauty, Relationship, and Real Value”**\n\n*(Any one of these can be tweaked further.)*\n\n### Proposed Outline\n\n#### Part 1: **SEEING BEAUTY**  \n- **Chapter 1: The Myth of Separation**  \n  - Modern businesses often treat everything (people, resources) as separable pieces.  \n  - Unpacks how this creates meaninglessness, burnout, and ecological harm.  \n- **Chapter 2: A Different Lens: Beauty as Clue**  \n  - Introduces the idea that “Beauty is truth’s adornment”—a universal attractor to real value.  \n  - Stories: The Turkish shopkeepers, the immediate difference between a lovingly crafted rug vs. a mass-produced item.  \n- **Chapter 3: Oneness Hidden in Plain Sight**  \n  - We start seeing unity (tawhid principle) once we notice how everything is interwoven.  \n  - Thought experiments around time, meaning, and “presence vs. future-pulling.”\n\n**Attention Policies Activated:**  \n- **MOMENTS**: Key business “separations” we take for granted.  \n- **STORIES**: Demonstrations of hidden unity (e.g., crafts, local shops, supply-chain revelations).\n\n---\n\n#### Part 2: **LIVING RELATIONSHIP**  \n- **Chapter 4: From Transaction to Transformation**  \n  - Gift economics 101; trust + generosity as real drivers of value.  \n  - Example: Turkish neighbor-first ritual, or the orchard that gives surplus fruit away.  \n- **Chapter 5: The Rhythm of Day & Night**  \n  - Balancing outward hustle (daytime) with inward reflection (nighttime).  \n  - Business strategy benefits from “inward cycles” of learning and attunement.  \n- **Chapter 6: Relationship as Practice**  \n  - Delves into how we weave intangible forms of capital—emphasizing synergy over zero-sum.  \n  - Focus on “multiple forms of wealth” and how small relational moves can yield large blessings.  \n\n**Attention Policies Activated:**  \n- **RELATIONSHIPS**: Show how a single choice can either foster unity or create fragmentation.  \n- **RHYTHMS**: Both practical (organizing business schedules) and spiritual (reflection, day/night).\n\n---\n\n#### Part 3: **BECOMING BEAUTY**  \n- **Chapter 7: The Art of Craft (Business as a Living System)**  \n  - Craft vs. industrial approach: small scale, attention to detail, lineage, humility.  \n  - Why “a business can have a craft approach,” from product design to HR.  \n- **Chapter 8: Baraka in Action**  \n  - Introduces the concept of baraka (divine blessing) in a universal way (unexpected surplus, synergy).  \n  - Examples: A minute feels like an hour when you’re in flow; money stretches when used ethically and with gratitude.  \n- **Chapter 9: Practical Tools for Attunement**  \n  - Workshops, journaling, checking in with “inner signals,” reading emergent patterns in the market.  \n  - Real business examples: local entrepreneurs who embody these principles.\n\n**Attention Policies Activated:**  \n- **PRACTICES**: Concrete exercises (e.g., “Identify your craft lineage,” “Reflect on day/night business cycles”).  \n- **SENSATIONS**: Tuning into flow vs. force, synergy vs. scarcity.\n\n---\n\n#### Part 4: **FLOWING FORTH**  \n- **Chapter 10: Community and Flourishing**  \n  - How relationship-based businesses uplift entire neighborhoods, and/or create parallel economies.  \n  - The synergy of businesses supporting each other’s first sale or collaborative marketing.  \n- **Chapter 11: Defining Success on These Terms**  \n  - Overhaul your “KPIs” to include relational depth, ecological impact, staff well-being, intangible “presence.”  \n  - The relationship between “doing the right thing” and the actual finances.  \n- **Chapter 12: A Future of Beauty and Meaning**  \n  - Paint a vision of how, if more businesses practiced these relational + beauty-first principles, entire communities and ecosystems could revive.  \n  - End with an invitation to ongoing experimentation and growth—“the orchard never finishes growing.”\n\n**Attention Policies Activated:**  \n- **CHOICES**: Redefining “metrics” to match deeper meaning.  \n- **STORIES**: Visionary glimpses of what a relational economy might look like at scale.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Structure Serves *Your* Meaning\n\n1. **Beauty as Entry Point**  \n   - You’ve repeatedly said that beauty “adorns truth” and naturally pulls us into the **unity** beneath. Starting with beauty helps secular and spiritual readers alike find a welcoming door.\n\n2. **Relationship as the Active Practice**  \n   - The Turkish shopkeeper story, the orchard giving fruit, crafting a rug with lineage—these come alive in Part 2. It shows how economic transactions can *become* acts of **connection**.\n\n3. **Attunement / Becoming**  \n   - By Part 3, you’re inviting readers to step beyond “just knowledge” and actually **embody**. This is the personal transformation piece: journaling, reflection, practical exercises that “open the eye” to baraka, synergy, and synergy’s effect on finances.\n\n4. **Grounded in Tangible Business**  \n   - Part 4 explicitly addresses the big question: “What is ‘success’ financially and otherwise?” You rework the idea of KPIs into deeper forms of wealth or capital. **Implementation** tips tie everything together.\n\n5. **Full Arc**  \n   - The arc from “Seeing Beauty” → “Living Relationship” → “Becoming Beauty” → “Flowing Forth” matches your personal passion: we start with a new perspective, learn the practices, **live** them, and then scale outward to community/society.\n\n---\n\n## 5. How This Book Differs From Others\n\n- **Conscious Capitalism?** Has partial overlap (purpose, stakeholder orientation) but doesn’t address the **deep spiritual/relational** unity or baraka concept. Your book situates meaning in a more **holistic** framework (inward, outward, communal).\n- **Regenerative Business?** Focuses on eco-systems and living systems but often lacks the **spiritual / baraka / oneness** language and *experiential* approaches to meaning you bring.\n- **Buddhist Economics / Sacred Commerce?** They share some spiritual basis but typically come from different lineages (Zen, New Age). You bring a particular **Islamic-inflected** emphasis—e.g., the “Turkish neighbor-first sale” or “halal + tayyib” interplay.\n\n**Uniqueness:** You unite **beauty, baraka, and relationship** into a single, very **lived** and story-driven whole, bridging internal transformation and outward business design.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Next Steps & Suggestions\n\n1. **Gather Real-World Examples**  \n   - Keep collecting stories—Turkish shopkeepers, “fair-labor orchard,” a tech startup that “slows down to reflect,” a furniture craftsman bridging tradition and modern design, etc.\n\n2. **Weave Personal Journey**  \n   - In each part, **use your own story** of moving from Silicon Valley hustle to deeper relational, meaningful work. Show how you personally tried certain experiments (successes/failures).\n\n3. **Add “Thought Experiments” + Exercises**  \n   - Litter each chapter with invitations: “Try noticing the day/night rhythm in your own workweek,” “Track how you’re forced into future-pulling vs. being present,” etc.\n\n4. **Codify the Measurements**  \n   - Offer a handful of “relational metrics,” maybe a “business baraka check-in,” that are easy for readers to try and share.\n\n5. **Keep Theoretical Depth, but Temper with Story**  \n   - You have big philosophical fish to fry (tawhid, oneness, spiritual blessings). Ensure each philosophical point lands via human-scale stories and tangible business takeaways.\n\n---\n\n### Concluding Thoughts\n\nIn essence, **you** come most alive—and speak most convincingly—when highlighting:\n\n- The **beauty** that draws us toward the truth that “we’re one.”  \n- The **relationships** that make that oneness real in business.  \n- The **meaning** that emerges when people fully **become** what they’re meant to be at work.  \n\nA book structured around **seeing, living, and becoming beauty in business** (leading to a new kind of **abundance** and **community flourishing**) seems to capture your deepest convictions, your attention policies, and the unique message you have for the world. \n\nThat’s the **“call”** you’re answering—the call to help people see that commerce can be a **craft of integration**, a process of **bringing wholeness** into how we feed, clothe, house, and serve each other in **meaningful** ways.",

      "content": "What about the historical analysis component? Should that be it's own book? I don't think I want to focus only on \"barakanomics\" and economics. I sort of think the core might be \"COME ALIVE\" and then \"at work\" - or amybe not, i'd like some pros and cons, think about what you know about me and come up with a few options: \n[[[it's it's it's like most of the people humans uh on earth not all humans because uh there are still people that are um in the same um uh way that you believed and the whole the world that they're in relationship, that won everything. But uh our uh w Western society, uh based on science and uh capitalism and everything, those people are kind of believing in science neither than the believer take it try to take some steps back and understand the whole like uh uh where where we are our our planet in the universe and what is the universe, based time and uh how what do we know, what we don't know and uh how earth is uh uh uh working instead of uh saying it's doing that it is and uh we are running too much fuel, we are eating too much and it's we can do uh uh in another way. Yeah.  Like fatalism. Yeah. It's fatalism scientism and fatalism that are killing the the sacred uh and yeah, the sacred uh look at the wholeness and but this is why I wanted to get a very um historic view, you know, because you just look I was happening now.  I'm trying, yeah. This is a part of what I want to share. It's like the history. like is it we' just pop up here and and we aren't necessarily like, you know, some people think of progress like this, right?  It just goes, I guess, and we are seeing the most clearly right now. We have the best ideas, the best science, then will you ever have, and tomorrow will be even more clear and more true and more real. There's a Christian of what is progress.  What is progress or like what is true knowledge? And the thing is I don't want to talk negatively about capitalism or negatively about scientism, what I want to say is uh, where did those ideas emerge from? Why is it so much a dominant?  Yeah, and to show like, oh, well, it makes sense that we did that. But also, does it make sense that it we could be overdoing it? Because it does make sense to try to protect yourself, right?  Like let's say, you know, for instance, you've got to a car accident you weren't wearinging your seatbelt. You got hurt. And then after that you start wearing your seatbelt.  That's okay. That's a good lesson, right? And so part of the lesson that, you know, we could have used science to use if we had it back then, to learn about the black plague, is people would already concentrating into cities.  People were already over like I was doing this research today. There were depleting their farms. They were overproducing on their farms, they were getting less returns, so people were under nourished like cities were crowded and dirty and like the conditions were good for a plague, you know?  But uh that doesn't happen in in cultures that don't have something that makes people think the best the right thing, you know? And the to live, to live in this way to like uh have a, uh, also a part of it was the peasant and landowner relationship at this hierarchy of dominance, and that's why I had to go back before the black plague because the black plague made me realize a little bit more about like why people left religion and why people were looking for hedonism and more like focus on life and individualism, but before that there was this bringing in of hierarchy and power structures, because when Christianity was not formalized, it was very diverse, a lot of different opinions. There was nobody to tell you might think that other person is really wrong, but you and 100 people will think that them and 100 people there was no pope, there was no like massive Catholic church. before the Myan creed was decreed, and they brought many different Christians and I think.  NIAN creed. Yeah. NIC EE So this thing.  Creed of constantinople happened in like ten first canceled Nicea 325, not like a 440 451. So it happened about like five 300 to 500 years after Jesus., basically it's after the Roman Empire uh end. Yeah, but it basically transitioned into the Christian Empire, because Constantine became Christian, uh the like it was a it was a Romanonsenseinople, there's double Chchus guy where.  Oh, wow, they have it. And so what I what I started looking into right now was like what were the things that were formalized here? That uh first Council of Contents in O Roman yes, a Roman emperor was the first one to put it together.  And so they inherited a lot of the Romans ideas about power, right? Like what's his name? Um Marcus Aurelius is considered a god, okay?  This is I bought the book uh thought for myself. Yeah, he he's an interesting guy and he's a very thoughtful guy, but in in Roman like early Roman history, the kings were considered gods, right? And so this idea of hierarchy and of an authority that is more important and can control and subjugate the under length begins in the Roman Empire and then gets brought into Christianity because now that there is a an authority in Christianity, now, like all of these people said, like, this is what Christianity is.  We can't have anybody saying that Jesus was just a prophet, we can't have people like differing about these different details. We are now going to sit down and just write like this is Christianity and everyone else is wrong. And it created this uh church people god and the churches in between kind of thing.  Yeah, the clergy and um like the this hierarchy. And and yeah, so so this is what I was sort of to to do this kind of historical analysis. And there's a gap here, like I did it I think I figured out a little bit more about like the black plague and how that led to like individualism and that, you know, at some point leads to capitalism and, you know, it keeps going from there.  But before the black plague, there were the things that gave rise to the conditions that let the black plague emerge, which is congested cities, um, uh impoverished people, uh close, like condition for Yeah. So this this part I want to understand a little bit better, and I think it has something to do with the the Nican creed and this hierarchy that gets imported into Christianity that creates this like peasant landowner divide, which you can so at a seat today in terms of like hierarchical power structures. How do you uh study all this?  I mean, I knew about a lot of these pieces before. but then I started to think like of course I knew about the church. history documentaries, studies. on all the different of these things like I found a book today for the black plague. I'm going to see if I can get it. But basically like I've I've known about, you know, I read a book called Galileo's error and it's about Galileo when he first came up with his idea about the language of the world as written in mathematics, language of the University of mathematics.  He also says, but that doesn't capture quality. That is a separate thing. My whole like mathematical science approach is to focus on what I can actually define mathematically.  But there is quality, but people ignore the quality things that you say and focus on his idea that the world is describable by this systems. And so I know all of these things I have read many books in the history, but I started thinking today about the question of just making it very simple. It's like where did Oneness go?  You know, where did the sense that everything is a cohesive, holistic thing that we're a part of, go and why do we have this alienation and the sense of me versus the world? me. So that's the that's the only question and then I want to look at history through that lens, because I think, like instead of trying to go like talk about climate collapse or talk about alienation or loneliness or war or all of these things.  I think those things are effects of a mindset of alienation, a mindset of other, a mindset of not one of of many and I must protect. And so I'm trying to like go backwards, figure that out. And then what I want to do with the book is give people an experience of wait a second, not, there is quality, you know?  Like, first of all it' be like, that's where my ideas come from. You know? For me, I had this big realization one day because I grew up in a very conservative Muslim family, but uh there's actually a lot of different ways to think about with some, you know?  And in history, there's a lot. And at some point in my life I was meeting Muslims that were like very different than me, you know? They had different behaviors, they were smoking pot and still Muslim and they were comfortable with themselves.  It was like they were g marijuana. They were ganaan Rostafarianyncretic Muslims, okay? Meaning they mixed between inside?  Yeah,. And so I met these people and they were like, yeah, well, most of them Rust God. and Allah Muslim Arabic, right? And so they were like, Jah.  I'm like, whoa, how are you who you are? How? And then I was I had this moment when I was young.  I was like, how am I who I am? And then I started deconstructing where I got my religious ideas from, and its history, which was related actually weirdly enough to the British because the British mess everything up, and Saudi Arabia, and they picked this one gahhe, maybe randomly, maybe strategically, but they p so, you know, in many traditions, everything has a bell curve, everything can be put on a bell curve, right? There's extremes, and then most people are in the middle, right?  is a science bell normal curve.ussian curve. They picked the guy that was just more extreme than everyone else, you know, the guy that's like very strict and very tight and very like difficult with his interpretation, who's like music is had on and everything is had on and you know, like a very uh once make things hard, right? But even in our book theoran it says God wants ease and not hardship, but for whatever reason he skips that that thing when he reads the book, and he gave because he is so funny the history and the accidents.  Look what happens. This guy becomes the king of Saudi Arabia because he's promoted by the British, the British, you know, kind of I handed it over to him and he becomes not the king, but he he influences the king and he kind of creates the the religion of the whole country, right? The most moral looks to Saudi Arabia because it has Mecca, as like the most Mussim place in the world, right?  But what happens is not only are they they already have like Saudi Mecah and like most people think of it as the most most place in the world, they find oil in the 70s. And now they can supercharge their ideology and spread it around the world, right? So when you open up oran in the messages that I was growing up in Michigan, on the front, it says a king, a gift from the king of Saudi Arabia that they were paying for scholars to get trained in their way of thinking, and then they would fly them around the world and implant them in mosques and that's where my ideas came from.  That's where like I was taught it's called stelapism or wabism, okay? Because the guy was named Yeah. Was his name Abdalbin and Wahb?  a very uh, like you said, uh angry thoughts, uh, very strict and controlling. And it's um those people are like, uh help theirselves withorum and no, I don't I't the thing that I was trying to get to here is the interesting thing is there were two accidents that made it so that this interpretation of Isem was mine. I grew up thinking it was just true.  It was the way I understood the religion and like one I know thinks this way and taught me that this is the right way to think. um I didn't know that there was such a thing as diversity and that maybe they have different ways of thinking. I thought everyone else was wrong and we were right, okay? Until I did the exercise and I realized like, okay, the British picked Abdalele in Wahab randomly.  I don't know why they picked them, but they picked him and then, too, is that country that uh uh is now very rich and can spread its ideas around the world. And that's why I have this ideas. And so that's kind of what I want this book to do.  I want people not to just think like, oh, down with capitalism or, oh, down with the, you know, like, let's all take, uh mushrooms and be one with the universe or something and like like dress like Native Americans and live back to the land. No, like there there were different ways of seeing the world that got filtered out and blocked systematically because of historical events and how they influenced culture and philosophy, and all of these things kind of work together, you know? And I think some of those very critical ones are the hundredyear war, the thirty Year War, where most of Europe is just fighting religious wars.  If you know a little bit about history, there was a period where there was a lot of religious wars in Europe between No, religious wars between the Protestants and the Catholics and yeah. And then those those two I don't know how those influen the the thinking, though. Tuesday should be history.  And then before that, there's the black plague and how that influences thing. and before that I think it's the IN creed and how that influences things. So the Niccing creed brings this dominance hierarchy structure, the black plague brings in the individualism. And then after that we have the hundredyear award that removes uh like makes it more secular.  So it's like hierarchical individualistic, secular, scientific, and each those things has a progression. and they add up to each other, right? hierarchy and power, like individual than individual power. Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You getting it. And so, uh, but I think once people see this and then they realize like, oh, holy crap, that's why we're like this. That's why we like people talk about like Western culture What do you expect, uh, which kind of effects?  I want first this realization, this aha of like, oh, that makes sense. That's why I feel that's why we are so disconnected from nature and why people in different cultures have a different relationship. there is like a bias. Maybe there is a bias because not every people are interested in those subjects.  And then even if uh these ideas would be spread and known by everybody, do you think that most of the people would be able to understand. This is why the so that's the prep work. That prepares the mind for the next step, which is the most important step, which is to re access a natural faculty, I think everyone has and everyone knows the faculty that is activated when they sense true love, not lust, the faculty when they see nature that makes them stop in their tracks and just look in awe, right?  This this faculty that knows truth, goodness, and beauty, as, and that those three things are three things, but there are also one thing in a moment of awe, there's no words. Words are the things that take one and make it into many, and so that experience, the faculty of what I call quality, not quantity, not numbers, the quality, is non segmentable, but when you start to put words on it, you use words like beauty, truth and love. But in reality, that's one thing, okay?  And so what I want to do is get people to understand that that used to be an experience that we have, this integrated sense of a whole, this thing where, you know, the thing that in other cultures turns into people communicating with trees and animals, and even if they're going to sacrifice an animal doing it respectfully, only as much as they need, knowing their bounds because they know they're a part of a complete system that is in harmony, that there is an idea of harmony that things are inbaled, the yin and the yang I take when I can and I give when I can and like this kind of less domineering, more integrated, more relational structure emerges from all I want people to do is acknowledge that love is love and it's not so molecule. That's it. And to do that, I think we can take two steps.  One is that this perception is true and that this perception is reliable. Okay? So what what we need to do is help people distinguish between emotions and mood and a quality perception.  Does that make sense? Because some people might think like, I am falling in love. I'm feeling love.  It's like, no, just chill for a second. Wait. Is that love or is this like, excitement?  Is it lust? Is it, uh like, how do how do you know when you're feeling something that is connected to this thing that I'm talking about that is connected to the beyond to this thing that is meaningful and true in a deep way, uh and and distinguishing it from all of these fleeting emotions that go up and down and change and definitely have hormonal and biological and physiological uh can uh relationships. uh and there are people that are studying um awe, right? They're actually looking at a in like the sense of amazement, right?  In neuroscience and cognitive science, and so actually, I think my book is going to require me to do a lot of interesting research finding those researchers that are looking into these things and in in the end, I want to do a historical thing, a scientific thing, and then an experiential thing. can you go these humanity contemplation? Which one the sense of quality? I call it a faculty.  It's just like we have a faculty of hearing and seeing and smelling and tasting. We have another faculty of perception. love, goodness and truth, is the thing that, you know, you see a sunset and you just stop and like, that's amazing. Or like a waterfall or a a beautiful antelope with huge antlers in the wild, and you have this like sense of alive awe connection, reverence, you know?  Or or love is maybe more more most people, uh find it, if they have a sense of true love, like, for instance, you're holding your baby for the first time, right? And then, you know, you might ask people, okay, what happened there? What happened when I'm realizing is like, all of these things happened with an Icyon creed and the dominant structure and then the black plague and being like, I should live my life before I die or whatever.  Like all these things kind of add up to a way of being that blocks that way of seeing, that perception, that faculty that we have. It exists, though. It doesn't go anywhere.  It's like it's like we we have been walking around with one eye closed and they were like, hey, one second, just like try opening this this eye a little bit and like, what. Whoa, I can see in 3D. And that's kind of the the the metaphor that I want to say is we're seeing the world as if we have only one eye and it's flat and we don't have depth perception. It's kind of hard to tell, you know, how far things are.  But then, like once we open that second eye, we'll have depth reception and we'll know how to navigate our difficult and challenging times. It's not that we give up rational thinking or even self-protection. Like put on your seatbelt, you know, use science.  It's okay, you know, these are good things, but it needs to be put into balance with another good thing. And I would say, you know, because this is this is how I think is the right order is truth, goodness, beauty first, and science rationality to serve it. Like, should you should your head serve your heart or should your heart serve your head?  I think your head should serve your heart, you know? So this is my like thinking about it you know the same and uh I was wondering this faculty that that was more developed in the past before I see and maybe the faculty still exists in many cultures. it's meaningful. and do you think this faculty is hurt or maybe step in now This is one of the reasons why I wanted to do the research on near death experiences. A near death experiences, most of the time people come back and they make major life decisions.  Chang non-meaningful things are cut out of their life. They orient towards relationships, um, and it shows that it might take a wake-up call for people to pay more attention and realize what really matters in life, you know. And I think near that experiences do that. um But, you know, the whole planet is having a n nearative experience right now with climate collapse and all of these things.  And so many young people are considering suicide. There are, I think we talked about it last time, underage suicides, like preteenagers killing themselves, worried about the future. That is insane, okay?  Kids, like literally kids. And so the way I see it is like we are having a kind of planetary near death experience. There's a lot of stress and fear about the future.  People aren't having children and might lead to a population collapse. Like there's a lot of these issues. um and it's spilling out into the political sphere, that anxiety about things mean me first, um the France first, America first, refugees leave, you know, it's becoming more protective because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow and has all these negative consequences. And so I think, you know, talking about this and looking at like the research in near experiences and the the qu-quote solution is, I don't really want this book to be understood by everybody.  I just want to create practices that help people like connect to that perceptual faculty and acknowledges acknowledge its existence as a source of reliable and true information that is it's not like a, you know, some people talk about intuition to talk about some of these things. Like I have an intuition. I'm feeling, you know?  But it's just an idea, it's just a feeling, you know? But no, what if we distinguish between feelings and recognition? That's what I'm trying to suggest.  That we just like you recognize something with your eyes, like, this is a pencil. That's a pencil. You you can recognize something with that faculty, that perception.  Instead of saying, this is an intuition and then blowing it off as like, an emotion. an emotional as if it's not real, it'll just come and it will just go, being like, I have an intuition. Maybe I need to like dig into it and open that eye wider to get the message to get that message, right? And so it does involve some things like meditation or prayer or contemplation or just sitting with your emotions until you can see your emotions and then see beyond your emotions.  Like at some point, if you sit with your emotions, you can be like, oh, that's a feeling, it comes, and it goes, but this thing is here and it just stays. only a fancy. Yeah, we have the non-fancy version. We'll get a fancy one someday, don't worry, dear.  No, the toilet is That's right. Only one time the Japanese toilet in our parents' house. You've never really tried it.  Only one time because I was like you can change the pressure. You can make less strong. yeah, I's it's like taking a shower. It's it's less smeary. and spreading.  Yeah, yeah Arabs think of you know like people look at Arabs like dirty Arabs, Arabs look at the Western people and like, you're actually dirty, literally dirty. Definitely dirty. We were talking about this and I don't know, it's I had a family uh during my consultation on it was uh moment dad and uh the two children and uh so one were four years old and a girl was uh I think she was nine and uh they all have the gasro.  Oh no. And uh so uh I I exam then all and um I started with the little one and uh then uh the the mother and then the uh the the two of the the two others and uh at the end I was doing the prescription on the computer and the the little, the little boy, uh four years old, he was sitting on uh the legs of his. And he said mommy, I I shoot on myself oh no it's it's it went through the pens on the mother's legs.  I saw it was shit happens you took them like to the like what did you do you give them to it was only on the legs of the moment the children they went on the toilet and I gave them a tissues, yeah some tissues. four years old if he has a guest who you should wear diapers or something. Yeah. I don't know.  Yeah. So we now have both have our thesis to write. Yeah, but all these subjects are very deep and interesting and I think it's a good uh work yard you you are doing.  And it's very hard because you have to connect a lot of different things. You can have a consensus, but it's very hard to get it get to this point because people will always say that's not true we are all other influences or is just the, you know, it's just random evolution is run down and yeah, this is why one of the things I want to do is make it a a science by trying to build a community of people working on listening to that part of them that I think is a real thing. And then I don't know.  And then basically if it exists, it's gonna be in a tradition. It's gonna be in like a religious tradition or a spiritual tradition. I'm trying to say that this is like this is just something that human beings have access to.  This is why, like I don't think of myself as a Muslim because I grew up in this tradition. Like I had a very big period of exploration and questioning and wondering and it gives me also yeah, it gives me also a structure. But also, I think it's true.  Like I actually believe in the that if people were to think and explore and feel and let go over their biases and their emotions and try to understand, like, who am I? What is the world? Are we created?  Do we just as it just biological? Where do my ideas come from all of these things? That it might not look uh super Arab, uh, but like the fun the foundational principle of the most tradition is there's only one god.  And that he is not divisible, that uh he is the first and the last, and there's uh, you know, all of these like the the foundational principle is there's only one God and that the second most important thing is he doesn't leave us alone. He actually writes writes us stories and messages. I think there's only one thing, yeah.  Oh yeah, or like, uh the the Greeks, you know, with the the god of the things and, it's sort of like just questioning Yeah, they' that's actually kind of what Joe is doing these days. She's exploring the 99 names. And so there's there is only one god, but the the names are just like the Pantheon, like, there's the god of what is this?  the promoter or the advancer? the most merciful, the source of goodness, uh the avenger, uh the so so these like often come in pairs in the in the Muslim tradition, like today is uh we're reflecting on the name of God for the all seeing. One of the qualities uh Rahman.  Yeah. So this is the only Rahman only name of God that's Rahman.. So, the the way that the name works is very much like the Pathan or like Taoism, where there's often these binaries, right?  There's the first and the last, the one that honors people, the one that actually brings people to dishonor. the giver of life, the bring her to death, right? So this is still the one God, but it has these aspects. But the only one name that is ever used on its own is the most merciful. or thou god.  Which is not a description. There's either so it's either a law, which means the god or a Rahman, which means a the most merciful, and when God describes why he sent the messengers it's only to be a mercy for all of the universes. And so you get this idea that it is oneness and the primary quality of this oneness is goodness, love, beauty, truth, how everyone to talk about this all enveloping all nurturing mercy that is a the only other the only way that oneness wants to be understood in the Muslim tradition, at least.  But what I what I want to do with the book is to make it experiential, to ask people to do these practices, to reflect on what they think it means, to look at the history to understand, to to look at like one of the things that's really interesting is most indigenous cultures do have this property of oneness about it. And and being a part of a whole rather than everything is just random and there's a lot of different pieces and segmenting and cutting the world apart. It's the relational element with with everything.  And so I think that means something. I think there's something important to realize there and that Western culture is weird in the world. It's not normal.  It does spread because of the dominance and some of the different principles that cause it to be over overreaching, but to to say like, what would Western culture look like if we brought back the part of us that saw that we were part of everything else? You know? It's not that Western culture should book like native culture and have feathers in our hair or whatever.  No, like there's some really beautiful things about baguettes and berets, you know, it's great. B. B. is really wonderful things about these things, but like it's a special expression in English now? B?  No, I just made it. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay., yes. But but like what does a French culture look like when more French people you know, French people, I feel like are very cut off from religion because of the uh French revolution and because of like its own historical uh history.  But imagine if we didn't even talk about religion and we just talked about, okay, when we got rid of religion and we overemphasized like reason and rationality, we cut ourselves off from intuition, understanding, unity, wholeness, meaning, you know, things that actually make life worth living, and it's not just about eating great cheese and having affairs, you know, and sleeping around. Like there's something more and what would it look like when French culture finally opens up that eye of perception? It will be amazing.  I don't know what it could look like. I was wondering about because there is a French his name is in the one of his show is uh is speaking about French people. And the the history of uh this uh people and uh he is uh telling that uh, yeah, uh we are Gurwa.  And uh What's Gurwa is the old name for French people, because before French, France was uh gold. Oh yeah, the Ga.. and the Gauls and the Visigoths and the Goths, yeah. uh some Spanish Arabic, Italian, uh, uh immigration and the revolution and uh basically is it is kind of speaking uh fast and uh uh t this about uh, uh we don't want a president, we want uh, a piata, you know? Pinett We want something to to to break down and hit a five years we are very how people like uh as you said, uh French are totally kind of the partially related related to this idea of like when it's our responsibility now to make things better, but it's not better, we need to fight the thing that it is and try to make it better, right?  So as it's it's very much like heaven is tomorrow, you know, if we just do the right things and we make the right plan and we create this social safety nets and you know, J John, like the yellow jacket then they won't be angry because they will have their things and and so it's it's very much we need to use our reason and our logic to make life the best. and when it's not the best, we got it wrong so we have to do it again. But the problem is, you can't use that tool to understand everything and make it work. It doesn't happen, and so you keep getting frustrated, you know, because, you know, it's we mentioned, I think the idea of the strip form, you know, uh the the farm where you reduce the number of variables so that you have fertilizer water and seed and you can expect this is the expectation.  Expectation always leads to misery and suffering because you never get what you want. But when you reduce the number of variables in a system, it's more manageable to control with the with our limited human capacities, right? We are not able to reason about all of the dynamic complexities of a food forest.  What you can only do is be a part of it. You know, do your little part, you know, uh create the conditions and and have trust and faith, you know. I think Jesus said, if you trusted God as God should be trusted, you would go out like the birds, hungry in the morning and full in the evening, but every day you will leave you this is not Jesus, this is not be dead.  You you would leave the nest. in trust and reliance and hope and fear that you'll find your warm for the day, and when you find it, you can truly be joyful, you know, and that's a difference of being a part of a system and the gratitude and joy and a wiveness that is there versus I ordered the bigmac on Uri and its taking wait long. It should have been here 15 minutes ago, and I have guests coming and I paid money for this. Okay.  This expectation and this like desire, this kind of way of yeah, and and I think that's also related to why the French keep, you know, pinataing their governments. It's like you're supposed to make everything perfect. It was a good plan..  Why don't we have utopia? What happened? Because there's this arrogance to thinking that you can figure it out.  But we can figure it. I was thinking about the movie June. There is a a part when you know black guy at the he fights with a pole in one uh Paul's dream, Janice is talking to him and he he said, uh uh to understand the process of life you just have to follow it.  And you see the the sand that is a vibrating and doing waves and yeah, I like this uh but that attitude is very not accepted, especially for for governments for businesses, for the world that we're in, it's to understand life, you need to make a map and a diagram and have S do you know the SDGs are? This sustainable development goals, I think I all develop them. yougnore the SDGs. Our government is like, okay, so we have poverty and we are gonna make a pyot and this one has to be smaller and then we're can allocate more resources here and then that's going to move this one, like expand the other part of the government because the minister uh we had the first minister and the he he had he was kicked the out because uh the budget, uh with the idea of all the other uh the group the Yeah, so they they are trying to do this now. they're trying to figure figure it out.  But I wonder sometimes like what my ideas would look like if they're more balanced. Because how does the perception of quality fit into budgeting for a country? How would it look differently if it was accepted that you know, that we can't understand everything, that we have to be integrated into systems that life actually makes sense as we go through it.  Maybe instead of starting and making a budget in the beginning of the year, we do budgeting where every day we are attuned to the reality of our society as much as possible, and allocate appropriately day by day rather than you know, make a big plan or maybe that maybe that's where it needs. Maybe it needs both. Maybe it needs the pie chart and the plan in the beginning, but then every day allocating the allocating, being attuned, talking, connecting to people connecting to what is supposed to do connecting with the feeling of what you're supposed to do you know sometimes people make a good intention in the beginning, like, for instance, me and Duol lingo.  I had a good intention. I wanted to learn French, I wanted to talk with your family, I wanted to be wanted to be. But now I do duolingo just to make the streak, right?  So if I was in touch with the reality, I would either tell myself, okay, you either commit to it or just stop, because right now you're not learning French and you're just doing things to make this number go up. You know, just like people in a budget. We allocated budget to the arts because we wanted to have a flourishing creative community.  Is that doing it the best? Or is there a different way to allocate money to make sure that we have a flourishing creative community? Because there's so many people in jobs around the world, especially in governments and in the UN, where they know that this isn't the best use of funds, but this is what they're doing and they have this creeping feeling of like, this doesn't feel right.  This is wrong, but they just do it because because they don't have this, they only have this. They only have the once a year decision. integ, you know, and countries are basically uh some uh found our lending money to countries, and I think it's so complex now. I don't know how we could maybe erase all.  I mean start again and through like this watching what we are being more grounded realistic, connected to the you know, the the the thing that people kind of hope for is like, okay. We're collecting more information than we know what to do with. AI will solve it.  That's what they're thinking. They're thinking they'll just give everything to AI and it will be able to find the patterns that matter, but what I'm trying to suggest is we can't delegate this because I think that our perception of of goodness is and that feeling of like, is this right? This doesn't feel right, you know?  You can't get that. This it doesn't feel right and we need to be able to trust that. So for instance, this is one of the stories I'm put in my book.  And I think I forget his name, but this Russian general was looking at his uh monitoring system for nuclear warheads, and he saw five nuclear missiles coming from America. and he freaked out. The red light started spinning, the alarms went off, literally he was in the control room. All he had and what his job it was was to monitor this, and if America sends missiles, Russia sends missiles.  Okay. I don't know if you know about the Cold War. Yeah, so that was the Cold War.  That was the the common response to everyone was waiting for the missiles to fall, okay? And he saw the missiles. Why don't we have a story of five nucle explosions in Russia and he didn't push the button.  He didn't call his superiors. He had a feeling that said this can't be. Right.  And he trusted it. We are alive, probably. You know, like if Russia and America had a nuclear war, the world would look very, very different today.  And five nukes from America, let's imagine that they were real hitting Russia. And of course they would target major cities. Like we would live in a very different world and Russia would have anyway, it would have just exploded. and escalated.  So we're alive today and we have the world that is relatively safe without the major nuclear war because someone trusted this insight.. Yeah, it turned out that there was an error. Yeah, it was uh it was light reflecting off of a lake in New Mexico or something like that.  And so you? Yeah, and so I think that that story is like really important. uh and people need to like know about this story and to realize like this idea of creating AI plus our data to make decisions for us and without humans to be able to feel and to be close enough to reality. And this is the other thing that I'm realizing.  This is where it gets a little bit, I'm going to need to do more research on the science element, which is that guy felt something, even though the instruments which were mediated like digitally mediated instruments told him something. It was an artifact of light reflecting off of some clouds and water and yeah, like the radar systems like the I think it was a satellite system. uh But but yeah, it was an artifact that um it confused the machines. So my dad, when his brother died, felt it before he got the phone call, okay?  Many people have stories like this. Okay? And I think it's because this faculty of perception of um of oneness is one.  It's not to it's not spatially dependent. It's so that person looking at the radar had a disconnect between this faculty and this faculty. He sees the radar and it says that missiles are coming, but this thing says that they are not right?  How did that how did that thing know? That's So so this is where it gets like kind of into the place where it's like a little bit crazy, you know, where you start saying like, okay, well, you can you can perceive the right thing to do uh because it digests everything that matters about this decision and gives you a sense of it. So, and it's trustable and reliable, but it digest everything in all time and all space for this moment, you know, like relevant for this moment, but it doesn't actually matter about how far you are from the thing.  That's the kind of this is like I'm not sure if I need to go there for this argument, but that's what this story tells us. That this person had a faculty that was connected to the reality of what was happening beyond his line of sight and the instruments that were telling him what was happening were at conflict with it, but he trusted his intuitive sense or his quality sense or whatever. I think I need a better word for it.  Like I I I use the word quality, but I don't think people um I'm trying not to say things like heart and I'm trying not to say things like soul or spirit or anything that can sound religious. uh and quality in quantity or I think really good pairs of antonms, you know, it's like the quantity of things. You can measure like how far this thing is. You can measure how many, you know, silicon atoms make up this thing if you had a really it's not enough I think it may be why you try to search another word.  Do you have any ideas isn't heart? Or intuition? I'm Yeah.  And uh I was thinking about two things? The gravitation we detected a recently? Yeah, the gravitons or yeah.  The black holes that collapsed and it made waste and we could uh detected because the crazy thing is things were squished together. like isn' that crazy? Yeah. like space time squished and we got squished too, but we we didn't feel it. a very little bitters. But no, and I was thinking also about in the movie when the woman I say uh love isn't uh meatmeasurable, but it can cross space and time, you know it's interesting movies gravitational waves the kind of keep the information and it's not uh influ influenced by its base and time, you know, it' it's crossing space time.  But isn't everything crossing space time? Like right now, if you do this, you're affecting the farthest star at the end of the the universe.? Because, you know, gravity has an R squared relationship R is the distance, right?  But it never goes to zero. And so by moving my head over here, there is slightly more mass over here and the entire center of mass of the universe has shifted because I did this, right? And so it as a real effect, but that's the idea.  You can sense it if you if you are very, very very very extremely super ultrasensitive. you could sense it on the moon, you could sense it. You know, they you can actually see these experiments with gravity here where, you know, you put a bowling ball next to something and they can actually sense the amount this thing moves towards it, right? So you have a bowling ball on a string and a on a string and they actually can see it's very, very tiny amount.  But because the bowling ball has mass and it war up space time, then this thing moves, right? And so it doesn't take the graitation waves. It just takes mov, you know?  Everything is literally connected. Everything is talking to everything at all times, even just gravitational. Like I'm pulling you towards me and you're pulling me towards you right now.  Like Newton? Yeah. I'm not sure, because uh Einstein kind of uh uh you know, change everything musicfficient. money.  Newton said the third law, when two masss are there, they are it's so Einstein's idea is space time, but you are warping space time. So I concentrate space time. Yeah, a little bit.  I concentrate space time over here, which is why you feel the effect of being run. It's not necessarily like yeah, I I'm bending you a little bit towards me instead of using the Newtonian affects uh like uh never goes to zero. Yeah, yeah, to zero.  So yeah, that's the idea. So because it does affect everything at all times. Yeah, what I want to say is that, uh scientist of physicist say says that our universe is, uh um oh, there is a name an ejective to say that the physics low are the same at each point of the universe.  Self- consistence or something like that. Yeah, it's it's a very special word in French. and uh so because it it's never going to zero, but uh at our level we can't really see the the effect. But I was thinking, does does this gravitational effect could be related to the quality??  I don't know. Maybe I don't I don't I don't want to to uh explicit or to define it to try to to figure out uh what it could be related to, because uh it could it would be reduce it just like everything else. I think it no, no.ropic.  Yeah, yeah. Is. You know, sometimes this this thing we mentioned earlier, like when you are struck by something so awe inspiring, you usually don't have words, right? You're just yeah, you your reduce it to.  I yeah, I don't know. It's just How could it be meaningful and wordless? It's it's very interesting that the most meaningful things are often associated with moments of speechlessness.  And then later, a poet tries or an artist tries their best to evoke it, right in their poetry or their art, they try to put words on the unword did. truths, love, and goodness. goodness. It's it's also it's not just my uh language. This is like one of the things that um philosophers and theologians think of as kind of foundational elements of it.  There's an additional one that I use, which is beauty, but I think beauty is sort of like electricity in a solar panel, like when they' when you uh like like love and beauty come together, uh, when you love something you find a beautiful and when you find something beautiful, you love it, and so it's like the forces, right? It's it's war big space time and pulling things towards each other. That's what love does. love like takes things that are distant and tries to bring them together.  And I think that's actually a very interesting way of thinking about love as a as a force. It is actually a unifying force. Like people see each other from across the room and if they love each other, they just want to get closer and closer and closer and so they start kissing, you know.  And then they want to get inside of each other, just like become one, you know And actually, you know the weird thing is, I know it sounds very crude, but I think there's like if you look with the eye of metaphor and that nothing, well, it my interpretation, God does, is an accident, this stuff is very meaningful, like even even the sexual act as that representation of like, what does love want to do? It wants to bring things together and to take things and bring them to make one and then actually as what life comes from and like you can think about these metaphors and you can realize like, wow, man, God is hilarious, first of all. And and he's like telling a really good story here.  I'm searching a world because I have the impression that not that far. I was thinking about contemplation and Hm. Yeah, it's hot funny. good work.  You know, there's this relationship between, um love and attraction, it reminds me of one of the you know, things that the in the Muslim tradition says, like, why did God create all of this? And it goes like this. I was a this is God speaking.  He says, I was a hidden treasure that wanted to be known, and so I created so that I could be known and uh like this idea of love and knowledge is kind of evoked in this. It's like to to love and to to to to know and to be connected and um it kind of reminds me of some of the uh Indian philosophies about the Brahmin and this idea of oneness getting bored. and then hiding in multiplicity to recognize oneness and then to awaken to go back to oneness. This kind of idea uh kind of rhymes with this idea of being a hidden treasure and not being admired or known or loved, and creating in order to be able to to love and be loved. and that the and it's kind of interesting that love is the thing that takes the many and makes one.  And and it's interesting that it's actually, you know, what we just thought of historically. It's fear that takes the one makes many, right? It's the fear, the need for control, the it's so interesting.  I think love and fear are like love love is the unifying principle and fear is the the disunifying or the dispersing principle. Maybe it could be h harmony, liality harmony? Harmony, that is a result.  I think of following your perception of well, because I I asked IGPT I could be resume in one word roof, love, beauty, and goodness. You know what we can do as well, we can ask the similar question. We can ask um, can you come up with ten different ways to say quality versus quantity?  We want to find a new word for the faculty in that perceives quality. Okay. Let's see.  Let's see what it says. Depth versus breadth, substance versus substance versus scale, essent essence, versus extent, nuance versus count, value versus volume. OK, this sounds pretty good.  Meaning versus measure. Right?? Yeah, you either measure things, you know the own space and your distance or your like sense of meaning.  I like meaning quality versus quantity or meaning, and they both start with them. versus measure. That's not bad. Beauty versus bulk no.  Integrity sensna, discernment, value versus volume. That's kind of interesting. Value versus volume.  Nuance versus count. depth versus breadth. Substance awareness. Eence essence perception. essence perception.  I like the essence perception and discernment discernment and meaning can we go down this track? pisses conscience wisdom. Yeah, I mean, I think listening to it implies like that you're getting closer to wisdom.  I think like when we are listening to our lower like feelings of like fear, like jealousy or uh, you know, these like like can be addressed by tapping into the thing. It's like, okay, it's I'm feeling really angry or uh jealous, but when you listen to that faculty, how should I respond? and this is why I think the fundamental name of mercy really matters, and the fundamental like purpose of being to know and connect with a hidden treasure of like truth, beauty, and goodness is your your quality sense will never tell you like hurt someone else or hurt yourself, right?  It will never tell you yeah, I'm not so sure if the missiles are coming or not, but just fire anyway just in case you know I don't think that's going to be what happens. Usually, like the sense of meaning is also connected to self sacrifice on the opposite side of things, right? Like when we see Jesus or Gandhi or Martin Luther King Junior or pick any famous like story of someone that the band of brothers or okay, maybe not you, uh 300 uh yeah, yeah, all those people.  They lost. They all died, but they died with like honor and it left us feeling inspired, right and left us connecting to some of these qualities of years ago something it's not beautiful and the the aesthetic sense, but there's something beautiful about how they stared together and faced instrmumentable odds, and even if they died, they died with honor and there's something beautiful and good about that, right? And so it's it's something I think there's something very interesting about self-sacrifice. uh that kind of is important in this uh in this thing because it shows like the self doesn't matter.  There's like a a things a wholeness that matters more and being in harmony and in integrity and upholding what wants to come through your your your meaning sense or whatever we're calling it, you know, is more inspiring than you staying alive. But when you're in the fear, you just want to stay alive, you want to control, you want to substigate. It's like I will, I will, I will.  And like all these billionaire, you know what they're doing? They're building homes and compounds in islands around New Zealand. because they expect ocean levels a rise, New Zealand will be okay, um, they expect that this refugee mass migration thing will happen. They don't want to be on any land mass that's contiguous with other countries that are going to be experiencing climate collapse.  And they're thinking of self and self-p protection, and it's ugly, right? Like you don't you don't hear the story of like how billionaires are looking to preserve themselves. They hired a futurist named Douglas Rushkoff.  They asked him okay, we figured out the food, we figured out the land, we figured out all this stuff and we have money and we bought our place and we can survive. um and we have the people working on the farms and and all of this. How can we be sure that they won't revolt? and take over the property and like we're just one or two billionaires.  It's like a small billionaire family. How can we be sure that the personnel don't work together to kill us and just live on the island, right? And uh the the answer uh was, you know, you want, because you're a billionaire to delegate all the work.  You don't want to go and dig in the fields and figure out food and you'll kill the chickens. You want to hire people to do that. You want to pay people with food probably, right?  Because we're imagining an ap apocalyptic situation. And so what they were suggested to do was they have to do one thing and keep one thing under their control, which is food storage. They need to have the only set of keys you know, maybe biometric, maybe it's connected to their eye retina or fingerprint or something that people can't like chop off and use that needs to be connected to a very well-p protected sealed safe of food storage.  And if you do that, then you can control the rest of the situation. So I only tell that whole story. First of all, just to show you how that's ugly.  You hear that story and you're not inspired. You think this person is horrible, you don't feel like that's what we should be doing that's a good life, that's a good way of living, and we know that, but what knows that? Because it's the world Yeah, the thing that knows that, I think is that meaning sense. is that sense that says like that's not meaningful.  You might survive, but like you'll like, if you really sat with this and you didn't look at the fear that was making you do all that planning, you wouldn't be proud of yourself likely, right? I think, yeah, but just told it's kind of how our world is actually functioning. It's a real story.  It's not a hypothetical., you already told me this story of the billionaire in New Zealand. Yeah, I think it's a million people are those rich people want to try to stay in comfort and, you know and not helping people. But I was thinking about the whole stone.  It's actually how our world isn't right now, you know, the trillioners the most rich people in the world, those people are owning the industry of meat, of chemicals, and the the system, the political system and the economic system is built. so that we are like slaves working and keeping in control and the richer people, I know it sounds like communism and but uh the idea is there and it's still a bulful uh I think somebody once told me that one of the most important things that you can do for your freedom is to grow a little bit of food. It doesn't have to be everything, but just a couple of carrots, just a couple of like potatoes or onions or eggs or chicken. Once you start to realize like self sufficiency, even in a small way, like you get that feeling like, oh wow, like, because right now, I the way that I think about what you were just saying is it's sort of like these um the system as holding security and food and shelter hostage, and we have to, even though we know the system is broken, many people know this they feel like they have to go through these steps of getting a job doing these things in a certain way to be able to access the fundamental basic needs of metal hierarchy, great food, shelter, security, stuff like that.  And it's true. It's it's actually true. Like right now that's that's how the food is behind the paywall, you know?  It's interesting that they are thinking about these universal basic income and But I think about this food thing sometimes I'm like, hmm, if we owned some land somewhere and a farm that made enough food, and I looked into it. It doesn't actually take that much land and that much uh space to produce enough food for a year. Detroit I'm looking at property and So I also have like my family and my cousin's already there and yeah, it's actually really great. in terms of water excess.  It's one of the few places in the world that will benefit from climate collapse longer growing seasons, fresh water, a lot of people are weirdly enough, a lot of people this is why we should probably buy land there before too long, is people want to come to Detroit because of climate collapse. But uh yeah, other than Detroit, Russia But why would I want to go to Russia? Montes.  I thought about um Kurtisistan, also like wanna connect with roots and history and and meaning in a broader sense, right? Like what would. It's pretty fertile.  Okay, if you like mountains, there's mountains too. I am, yeah, actually, there's probably some good claiming. Kurt anymore.  Kurtan? It's I think it exists. Curtisistan never really existed in the nation stateway because the colonizers didn't realize that that was a people and they were like, well, the map should look like this, and this should be for France and that can be for England.  England, what do you think? Okay, no, no, this can be for France. They literally did that.  Do you know that? They got together. It's called the Sykes Peaks agreement.  You know about this? And they got a big map and they they drank a lot of coffee, smoked a lot of cigars and they literally drew a map. like this, and they called it putting wines in the sand, and there's some like really funny stories, like I forget, like I want to go find the thing. It's like apparently someone had their cup on the map and like somebody went a little bit like this and had to like avoid the cup and and and so you see the map of like one Yeah, you see you map with some of these countries and and it looks like and there's like this little zigzag in it and they're like, oh yeah, that was because I just didn't want to move the cup when I was, you know It's crazy.  It's it's just like when you realize like because and the rest of the world, like you look at Europe, all the borders are like this, you know? And that's people of either mountain range or that's people fighting this way and these people fighting this way. and like at some point they're like like, let's just call it a country and, you know, so let's stop fighting, you know? And you have like these very organic borders of nature and people, right?  Africa. Middle East Africa say America, like there's one states square. Yeah, but those are states in in one country, supposedly, but uh, just like the Middle East and Africa and all these places are just so so funny.  I wonder how like it's really good to be really curious, but it takes a long time for things to come together. you know? It takes a long time for things to come together. uh so well things like this this this kind of book that I'm writing, it started off because I wanted to write something about economics and I wanted to talk about like a different economic system. And then I realized that like economic systems come from like worldviews and then I wanted to like think about world views.  But because I've been such a nerd and so curious about so many things, I can actually like piece something together and was really interesting is that finally at the end, the the thing that I'm talking about is um is one thing is just one thing. It's like, and and by talking about this one thing, I can address all of the other things. I can talk about economics.  I can talk about like, why did we build this economic system? It's like, oh, because fear and need for control after, you know, the the black plague and like the council of Nicea and like hierarchy and that led to this these philosophers and history. And then in the end, it's like, I hope it's very practical.  Like I want in the end, even if the book doesn't sell, nobody cares. I want to start a coaching process that the only thing it is, it's related to have to and want to and to help people take there to do list and break it up into one of these two columns and then over time make more of their to do list on this side. That's it.  I think if we did this, what we're doing is we're getting people to connect with meaning more in their life that brings all of these other principles that we were talking about of like connecting to oneness or understanding um like their part in a broader whole because the a lot of the have toos are the I have to work to be able to eat. I have to do these things and usually they are not how you want to be, but how you think you have to be, and they usually come with tensions. They're like I have to go to work so we able to eat, but it's not happy I have to go to work usually.  It's ling this tension. And so when we do this coaching and we look at the tensions and then we ask, is it true? That's a pretty good start.  I think just doing this with more people, we can we don't have to explain all of history and where the ideas come from and we'll connect people more with their perception of meaning. It will give them more awareness of their feelings and why they have them, their anger, where they come from, you know, just by looking at your tualist and comparing half twoss and wanttos, and then asking about tensions. So this is a coaching practice that I'm developing and it's kind of comes with the book.  Wow, that's kind of cool. I think it's all because I've been working on this for a while, and initially I was working on like the economics book and then I tried to work on this philosophy book and then I worked on the the practice, but I think I have a very clear way of explaining how they all fit together. It's like there's like the understanding of the past, um how like history and philosophy evolved over time to disconnect people from oneness and then like so the core theme is this oneness principle uh and how do we get back to that?  That's I think the simplest way of explaining everything without having to get into so much detail, because there's it could be a lot of detail. I realized that I'm pretty much uh uh like, yeah, I I'm aware and I try to change to be more connected to the quality and uh the things that I want to and but I realize that I am functioning my life that I built my life and I'm functioning really much more like uh on the quantity how it works and what I have to do to get in and if you do you want to try going through the coach? Because I still have to um develop this.  I still have I only have tried running a a few times with a few people. It might be interesting to. Yeah, it could be interesting to try and it could also help you to develop it.  I'm not sure I yeah, I think I would be a good subject for for trial. But uh the thing is that maybe uh since I I passed the the 30 I uh I studied uh changing like trying to get more want to Yeah, you know, trying to to do some meditation, to to be more healthy and to yet do things that are meaningful and hmm it's still hard to do it right. Because is there right Yeah, but that's the whole uh that's is whole problem.  It's just uh I'm too much uh control. Yes. That perfection.  Yes. Yeah. That's interesting.  Well we can um we can try this like to to do this and we might not figure it out immediately, but it could be interesting to see, you know, every emotion tells you something. It's a it's an indicator of a way of being that is being blocked or prevented from uh happening. And so when you have these um feelings of like need for okay, I need to do it right, even myself development has to be right.  And you know it's all the medicine.. I think it's a big uh influence in my life. I I already I was already a bit like this before and it it went uh exacerbate exacerbate, yeah.  Yeah, with the medical students. Yeah yeah it makes sense. So it's it's like you learn these unconscious things about needing to be right Yeah, yeah, basically yeah, it's this.  I learn to, like, you know the science uh demar the method? The method It's all about uh what we we say before. the quantity, the trying to control things. Yeah. yeah.  And and you know, one of the ideas was not to have necessarily big transformations, but the idea would be to try to listen for this quiet voice, you know, this intuition, this feeling, and to answer its call, however, best you think you can, and then to reflect on was that better or worse, you know? So, for instance, like let's say, it might be a it was an interesting one. Like, when you let go of control with the barber, you didn't come in, with a picture, right?  That's a small experiment and easy one, yeah. So can we come up with more of these things and gradually build up to the bigger ones like relationships for sure. And you know what I told you about it's one big point in my life because I still feel a little a little bit guilty, uh with uh whether I I have done to her. with the history of the pregnancy and the abortion and uh and the whole all the um the very uh conflictual relationship before and after this event and uh yeah, and kind of uh always uh um questioning myself uh, either I uh school or uh did I school at all?  Did I uh h do uh bad things uh uh should I have uh uh cultivate more on this relationship uh was she uh the woman of my life uh does the the the entuition I I had before and now, uh what does that mean? Am I uh uh am I right? uh I don't know.  It's a lot of a lot of thoughts. So, uh, you know, coming from from my perspective, there is this uh this idea, especially for people that are on the path. You know, there might not be perfect, but they're on the path that when they die, they will look back, they will give you know they say life flashes before your eyes when you die?  That people on the path will look back and they look at their life and see everything that happened and not want a single thing to be changed. But that's for, I think, especially for people that are on the path that started on the path and then sustained on the path. um throughout their life. Whenever they started, it doesn't have to be starting uh, you know, from the beginning, like from birth.  But it could be that you, you know, there's this idea of uh penance and repentance and going to the confessionary or whatever it is in the Catholic Church. But this idea of like, if you have this intuition that you've done something that you aren't proud of, uh, one is it's in the past, but just make a commitment that you won't do that again, that you've learned your lesson. That's why we do bad things.  You know, there's a saying in the lesson tradition. If you lived and never made any mistakes, God would replace you with another society that made mistakes and asked for forgiveness so that he can forgive, because he is the all forgiving, right? And so this idea of like mistakes are not a mistake.  They're actually necessary part of a process of cultivating the heart of becoming like imagine if you've never made any mistakes and you died and you you know, a lot of life is about Catharsis. It's about like okay, that happened, but this time I'm gonna do a differently and then regular and then being you can be proud of yourself for doing it differently. You know, like, I had a similar thing in my life when I had a previous partner that, uh asked me if I love her, and I was like, I define love. like bring me a diction.  I literally ask for a dictionary, okay? I was like, I don't want to say anything is not true. Like, what does love mean?  you know, and because I couldn't acknowledge it because it would require me to fight my family and like, there was a lot of, you know, difficulties around this. And so I for a long time, I felt like, oh my God, I lost the person that I loved. I many thoughts similar to yours, right?  But uh, because there is one important point, uh, you you said here is when one partner is more in love than the other, and Inez was totally in love and she was very committed and I felt like uh I was uh hurting him her and I was uh uh evil and uh and uh yeah, I felt it really bad, you know, really guilty and bad, like sad. And uh that's why I had these uh whole circus of uh getting back with her, uh stopping and then getting back but you weren't sure what to do and then when you were in it didn't feel right. 20 times and uh yeah, that's why I asked myself, do I really love her, but I was not enough material to trust myself to trust my feelings? or was that not a good relationship and and I should uh just uh trust my uh what I felt and and stop it and not come back.  I remember this idea that we said that the faculty of meaning intuition and it's hard for me to trust my intuition because I have a lot of intritions and sometimes I was like, yeah, it's it's hers and sometimes I was like, knowing it can work because we are two different and so, you know, it's even now it's still hard to really be sure. So so and I think now things are really too much uh uh painful and then it's it's it's it's over. It's too it's it's screws. everything else too distant Yeah, but everything is damaged. and it's's damaged forever.  Yeah. I mean let's go back. What was that that message I was gonna say?  It was like is it true, first of all, uh the thing that okay, two things. One is there is probably a process of view that you can get clarity on, which is I know that people don't like this idea of sin, but you mentioned it yourself like, and was I evil, right? Like, what are the things that you want Sin, right?  There's uh doing bad, right? Uh, but you don't we don't usually talk about these things or even say like I was a bad person or I did something bad, but we sometimes do things against ourselves, against our own better judgment, against what we think is beautiful or right, like sometimes we are the billionaires building things and and so maybe like one of the things that you can just get clear on is what are the what like what are the waves that I was that I don't want to ever be again? One, you know, I don't want to do XY or Z or I don't want to respond like however it was, right?  With um with avoidance and distancing saying, I don't want to, you know, and and then just like ask for forgiveness and forgive yourself, and then never do them again, you know? And instead of being clear, like was I evil or was I like was I? It just be clear for you.  It doesn't have to share with anybody. I just like decide, like these are the ways that I want to be and these are the ways I don't want to be. So instead of the lessons being a little blurry, make the lessons very clear, you know, make it very clear, and then I feel like you need some kind of very it feels like a decision should be completely closed and what you can do is say, you know, that relationship is done.  I'm going to take these lessons. I know who I want to be now. I know how I want to be in relationships. um you know, it could have been a beautiful relationship.  I don't think there's only one size fits all for relationships. I think the opportunities for loving there is this idea of oneness we talked about. And it's one of the things that I told myself is like, everyone has a heart and a and a soul that's worth loving.  It's coming from the one and it's in a lot of different people's bodies, right? If I allow myself, if somebody is like, I'm willing, why would I say no? Why don't I also try to be willing, right?  What can I do to help open that door, right? And and I had like the intuition and so we cultivated and we work on like developing a love relationship. It's not this idea of like she was in love or I wasn't in love.  It's just an opportunity for someone to open the door to their spirit was available to you, and you missed it, but everyone has a spirit. Every one you might find that opportunity you likely will find that opportunity again. right? Because I feel like when you just said, I missed it.  I feel like it. And I feel like uh there is the only one, the, you know, the the the love of my life, the only one, and and he's gone and it's over. No, no.  I don't I don't think that at all. I think I think basically like I mentioned, the way that I feel is that you can love it's. If somebody is opening their heart, like, I'm willing, and you're like, okay, well, am I willing?  And like I said, mentioned last week, it was like arranged marriages, you don't need arrange marriages. It's good to have practical things too. It's good to have um compatibility things too.  It's good to have sexual attraction, it's good to have all these other things. But then if someone's like yeah, like, I'm willing.. You willing.  Maybe it could be good, you know, like, I had these it's a feeling that I missed it. And there is one up there is nobody else, but uh but it's just a feeling and I feel like you and I uh I know that it's not true, but uh this is why I think live with this film. I think it's connected to the the regret and the remorse.  Right? So there's like this this um what is that? self-fl flagellation?  because I was bad explore this idea, you know it's it's kind of weird, but I have this masochistic, this note on my uh on my iPhone, which is called the C. Is it like understanding yourself? Yeah, yeah.  Like problems to analyze and uh some kind of introspection to try to find out and figuring out what's not working, what went bad, and uh I have this this idea of uh self uhician. I think this is why I was talking about accepting the lessons, digesting them and committing to never doing them again, asking forgiveness from you from God from whomever, from you as even maybe, it might be very cathartic to ask for forgiveness, if you can not ask to get back together, but just tell her, like, whatever it is, okay? Just ask for forgiveness. like's like I come and I ask for a forgiveness as if I wanted to to to feel better, you know?  Then do it for yourself, but what I'm what I'm seeing is if you don't forgive yourself here, you might maintain this potential I lost a love of my life and I'm never going to have this like again, uh kind of feeling, but I had some intritions that uh indicate indicated in indicated mirror that uh could be could be? Okay. The the idea of the one person is is interesting to to look into uh there there may be something about like some compatible people, but what does it mean for someone to be the one?  Where does that idea come from? versus there's many people and you know how many people find the one that are high school sweethearts, you know, they met in in college or whatever you want to call it. They fell in love.  They got married, and then they get a divorce, okay? Like, there life is hard and long and lots of things change. And there's many examples of this whole like I think that movies and culture shapes are understanding a lot of relationships.  And doing this whole movie historical analysis of like where do my ideas of love come from for yourself? uh, could be interesting. parents, movies. Yeah.  And and these stories but then also looking at it with the lens of like facts, right? Like you know, like even just this idea of what does falling in love mean? This is why I give you that book, because, you know, like there is there's and relationships and compatibility and all of these things that we're we're trying to navigate and is like living together, you know, like there's just people that they might love each other, but they have very incompatible lifestyles or whatever and and this is why I think like having this maybe the both eyes thing, like the pie chart and the uh feeling, it's like, okay, this does this make sense?  Is that person willing to gradually open their heart to me? And am I willing to do that with them and making love a process? And of course, like there could be a moment of intuition.  There could be a moment of like expansion and excitement and enthusiasm. But that just opens the door to the process. This is the thing.  I think people think that you fall in love and then that's it. Instead of viewing relationships as a craft, you know? And I think you have more of a discoverer than a craft perspective and it could be balanced a little bit more with the craft. to to fabricate to make to evolve to build together craft. craft is more like actually craft is the perfect balance between quantity and quality. because exactly. the potter making the pot, right?  It has a weight, it has specifics, they want to use the right amount of water with the right amount of clay, they measured, they mixed, right? But then when they get down to actually shaping it, it's still very precise ashemisymmmetric, but they are doing both the measurements and the feeling and the quality and the perception all at the same time. It's like You know?  And that's why I think craft is a great analogy and actually this is the analogy that I use for um how I want to do my uh my my programs and and um my trainings is to view it more of like a craft uh and putting things together with both your quality and your quantity at the same time. And of course, I'm just probably reinventing Taoism or something, but uh you know, they call it cho Have you heard of choiceless action? Wui?  Choiceless action? Yeah, it's called woo. It's, you know, you might hear it from what's his name?  uh, Bruce Lee, it's like acting without acting. Like, you're not thinking about punching, like a punch happens and it happens through you, and it's like a it's when you're in that space where maybe you could think of what way is what people do when they're in the zone, right? Where let's say that you're watching an Olympic athlete do a very complicated thing.  I don't think they're thinking about all the different steps because they've become the steps. and it's like an action that happens through them of them, and it's like craft of themselves in their bodies and whatever it is, right? Yeah. So it's called wui.  It's a Chinese like Taoist principle of it's called a choiceless action. as a one way of interpreting it. It was it would be like factories and industry and the opposite side, you have arts and in between craft. Yeah.  I think so. I think that's like a good description uh and I think though, like art and craft used to be more together. And then because of you know it's like when things get more extreme, uh there has to become a middle. you know, like Yeah, it's like here's and then like art yeah, and art just becomes weirder and weirder and less and less like yeah and then here's like industry and industry is just like getting super brutalist.  Everything is minimalist and art becomes like illegible and and kind of nonsense and what's the what that boyfriend that was making sound art when one of your cousins was dating this very tattooed guy and it doesn't matter. Well, you understand like this, so art art gets weird, okay? He he was dating one of your cousins, I think.  He's a nice guy. We saw him at some family reunions when we went to Bootzeg and saw your aunt. your grand.. Do you remember it?  Yeah So he's like moving our like way out I forget. He was a nice guy, okay? But like our life.  Yeah, it was out there. But like like you know when you go down to Mar Bell or lead and you walk by um some of these older houses and you just see like the tile work or the bricks and how they were made and like artisanship and art and practical life and uh artistic life weren't so disconnected. They were actually more harmonious.  And it was it's really beautiful to like think and then we go into modern buildings and modern life and it's an it's so funny. It's like um it's like oatmeal that you didn't mix, okay? You have the bland wall that's flats and modern and whatever, and then they hang a painting of some like really abstract art, you know, and it's it's like you have the industry of the building and the the weird art that moved all the way out this way, and then they try to mix it, but like in the middle is craft, you know, and it's you don't need to hang a you know, of course there's a lot of art in a church already, but like it's integrated into the building.  It's the windows. It's not a painting on a flat wall with like minimalist aluminum siding, you know? It's kind of interesting that there's this it's like what the balance, but they balance it by putting to extreme side by side instead of instead of like oil.s very interesting.  But this is what I think an artistic sensibility might be one of the ways that we can describe this, is the thing that we're trying to to activate here in the quality. If we talk about quality, if we talk about meaning, we talk about all this stuff. Like people might not relate.  But if we talk about like developing an artistic sensibility, you know, like to just see things more with like sense and meaning and metaphor and creativity and beauty and arts and stuff. That's hard to do for people that are not trained or not or in the opposite uh condition. And that they get trained to be more and more rational rational. oh yeah, you can't even tell a story.  What can we do this could be an interesting that's true. That's that's the problem. And it's hard when you realize it even when you realize it you try to say?  Yeah, try to it it's hard because you don't have a um I used to to read the books and how it works and uh the the The structure in the instruction, you. And so I don't have instructions to try to, yeah, andalyze my previous relationship, you know how to not uh know if it was wrong or good or yeah. Did you have this sense of quality?  Yeah. I think you might have already done it you keep a journal, like just a journal. That isn't about your patience.  Yeah. I not my patience, but uh uh my patients yes, but not me. So I think there is like good ways and not so good ways to do journaling.  I think, you know, I used to journal a lot um and one of the ways actually, maybe the next book I should give you is this one. It's called the artist's Way. and the key practice in the artist way is ad journaling, but it's in a very specific way. It's you start writing and you're not allowed to stop writing until you fill three pages, okay?  You're not allowed to stop or slow down, you're supposed to just start writing, and even if you don't know what to say, you could fill a whole page with I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, I don't know what and it's totally fine. But it's called freewriting, okay? And once you do that.  And you trying to figure out what I shouldn't. But but usually, like you say like, okay, so today is Thursday, I'm just waking up. I feel a little tired.  I'm not sure what to write, but I'm gonna try. I'm doing this artist way thing. It's kind of interesting.  I'm not really sure if I'm can be creative. is like it really what what is creativity? Well, I guess I'm writing right now. Isn't that creative?  you know, like, you start with nonsense and then by the end, you'll see like it starts coming together. But you're not supposed to read it. You're supposed to take it, put it in an envelope and seal it for at least six months, okay?  The whole point is not to judge yourself, uh, to not think that it's important or that it's not important. The whole point is to turn on the engine of creativity. Just by writing three pages and not looking.  The rest of the book is is expanding on that, uh basic thing, um including how do you get artistic inspiration? And she recommends going on an artist date. So like, what's the place that is inspiring for you could be going to the mountains or the beach or a museum or a concert, whatever it is, like, what is something that actually charges you, creatively and inspiring you and do the morning pages, which is the journaling thing.  That's it. You don't need to read the book now, like, you're good. There's a lot of practices, there's a lot of things to do, but uh like week one, yeah, there's a whole process.  You know, maybe I should do that. I think it will. I can take it.  You need it? I'm thinking about doing it. Okay. you know missing?  Yeah, I've done done the process before. but I've been wondering what my craft is, you know, like we talk about being an artisan. and I think that is important for any human to have their job, to have their life, to have their family, but to have a craft. But what is it? Is it baking bread?  Is it writing books? Is it? I guess I do a lot of my craft, but like Yeah, I guess part of me is is between this half two and one two.  Like there's there's stuff that that wants to happen through me, right? uh foraging, you know, um that just happens. I'm like, wow, I'm foraging.  I love it. It's just, you know, like I walk with a baby foraging, looking for mushrooms. Oh yeah.  Okay, so foraging is on I want to. it's not even like I want to. It's like emerges, right? And then I have to like sometimes I wish I could draw better, you know, like I want to draw more.  I and but I I don't find the flow and the I'm not sure. So there's like there's something over here about drawing, you know, when I think about like my creativity. Like I want to like draw.  I want to make um stencils. And uh yeah, I guess I'm kind of doubting my craft because I don't know why I don't you know, I feel like a craft is a very personal thing and it has identity tied into it. And I identify more as somebody who, I guess writes poetry or or does drawing than as someone who's a baker.  But maybe I could change my mind about myself. I don't know. That's kind of craft on poetry and drawing..  Yeah. What what would you think is your craft that could be what could it be? in craft.  Yeah, like what is your artisal thing that brings quality and quantity? I think music, music, making or listening? Making, but it's uh like if I if I would uh do something.  Yeah, music. you play piano? You're pretty good. you know. Yeah.  I'm I think I will never do this because okay. Yeah, it's okay. But uh yeah, I that something I could uh like to to craft.  I think, you know, touching it at least once a week, bringing it into your life and and feelings and feeling what you feel. You know I, uh um practice uh uh um piano lessons when I uh finished my residence because I have time down and I was thinking about uh uh following piano lessons. You know, do you have a piano that you can play at home?  Like a keyboard or's house, but Yeah. Because I feel like one of the interesting things to explore for you is how you can explore doing it with feeling more than doing it right. And my intuition is to explore the idea of improvisation.  You know what I mean? It's just like a feeling or like a guess from me to say like you looking for a teacher when you already have some technical skills, like you know how to move around, you know how to play pieces. um but this idea that we're we're looking for is the feeling side, right? You can even you can turn piano into a quantity all of it, right?  You can. You can make it about getting it right, getting it perfect, getting it, you know, and you can force yourself and you could have the hierarchy, and you could have the power, you can you know, or you can try to figure out like what helps you feel in that moment. A along with the technical, along with the rights and along you know, like you have to stay in the scale, you know, and jazz is about like doing that, but then breaking it sometimes and coming back and then learning how to how to flow, right?  It might be an interesting thing for you to explore, like what is improvisation or just feeling mean for you in music. Yeah. Yeah, but uh improvisition I think I would do just uhap you know Yeah, that's fine.  No one's listening at least, you know. We'll get you a in the piano example, uh to for me to to try to to feel the more an emotion and try to do something like uh improvisation and uh and I wanted to be still ammonious, but uh can be because I'm not uh uh neither uh thing uh emotions that I can translate into uh movements and doing a not. So we can play so this is doing advice And now he's doing this?  He's actually playing the key. And on the opposite way doing a harm many technical There's a a band okay, so two things. One is, I think it might be interesting for you to try to bring your meditation and your piano in at the same time. like we talk about like and make themgistic.  Um, you can you're only allowed two keys, okay? middle finger thumb, okay? And then you get into your meditation and just play the two keys..  Yeah. I can also already imagine it right now, you know, like so I feel like maybe there's something there, maybe three keys. I don't know, like you but limit yourself, don't think about technicality, don't think about harmony, don't think about anything.  And there's this band that's calledawn of Mid. um, which has a uh album called disnomia. Let me see if we can find it on YouTube. Yeah, here, this is the full album.  I'll just share it with you.]]]",

      "content": "Below is a concise look at **where the historical analysis might fit** in the broader framework you’re envisioning, plus some **pros and cons** for making it a standalone book vs. weaving it into a single volume. I’ve also thrown in a few title/subtitle ideas if you do decide on separate books or separate sections.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why Include Historical Analysis at All?\n\n- **Big Picture Context:** Understanding **how we arrived** at our current worldview (individualism, alienation, scientism) grounds the argument that other ways of seeing are possible.  \n- **De-Normalizing the Present:** Showing that modern assumptions (e.g., competition as default, “progress” as relentless growth) came from **specific historical events** and are not universal truths.  \n- **Unlocking Curiosity:** Many readers, once they sense we’re in a crisis of meaning, want **proof** it wasn’t always like this—and get excited by real historical twists, like how the Black Plague influenced capitalism or how the Nicene Creed impacted power structures.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Pros & Cons: A Standalone “History” Book vs. Integrated Chapters\n\n### Option A: **Standalone Historical Companion Book**\n\n**What It Looks Like**  \n- *Book One:* “Where Oneness Went: A Brief History of How We Lost Our Sense of Wholeness.”  \n- *Book Two:* “Come Alive: Reclaiming the Forgotten Faculty of Meaning (in Work & Life).”  \n\n**Pros**  \n1. **Deep Dive:** You can go **far** into the weeds—Council of Nicaea, Black Plague, the Reformation, Enlightenment scientism, the Saudi-British story, etc.—without worrying about bogging down a more practical/spiritual text.  \n2. **Scholarly Appeal:** Readers who *love* history and philosophy will devour this dedicated volume.  \n3. **Clear Focus:** Each book has its own mission—one about how we got here historically, one about *how to change now*.\n\n**Cons**  \n1. **Potential Overload:** You risk losing momentum and immediate applicability if the history is too separate from the “how to live” message.  \n2. **Delayed Payoff:** Readers might feel “I have to read a whole other book before I get to the practical transformations.”  \n3. **Extra Writing Overhead:** You create *two* fully fleshed-out books, which can be taxing unless you genuinely want a distinct “history deep dive” audience.\n\n### Option B: **Integrated Historical Chapters or Sections**\n\n**What It Looks Like**  \n- A single book—**“Come Alive: Rediscovering Our Lost Sense of Wholeness”**—with one major section that uses historical highlights to explain how oneness got eclipsed by hierarchy, competition, and secular rationality.  \n\n**Pros**  \n1. **Unified Narrative:** Readers see the **through-line** from ancient/medieval shifts straight into *today’s* crisis—and then into *today’s* solutions.  \n2. **More Story-Driven:** The historical parts can become “origin stories,” giving emotional resonance to the later advice or spiritual perspectives.  \n3. **Accessible Size:** A single, cohesive volume often feels more approachable than a separate “history tome.”\n\n**Cons**  \n1. **Length & Density:** If you go deep, you risk half the book becoming a historical treatise, which may alienate casual readers looking for practical guidance.  \n2. **Balancing Act:** You must carefully **braid** historical context with the “aliveness” or “meaning faculty” message so it doesn’t read like two unrelated books.  \n3. **Loss of Scholarly Depth:** You may have to trim down historical complexities to keep the pace moving.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sample Approaches to Integrating History\n\n### **Approach 1: Part I – “How We Got Here”**  \n- **3–4 concise chapters** summarizing major eras: Nicene Creed & hierarchy, the Black Plague & individualism, religious wars & secularism, Enlightenment & scientism.  \n- Keep it *narrative*, focusing on key turning points that fed the *alienation* worldview.  \n- Then pivot to “Now we see how the West got weird—so let’s see how to *un-weird* it.”\n\n### **Approach 2: “Historical Interludes”**  \n- Weave history throughout the book in **short, 3–5-page “interlude” segments** at the end (or beginning) of each part.  \n- Each interlude highlights a single historical shift (e.g., “The Black Plague & the Birth of Competitive Survival”) to contextualize the next chapter’s theme (e.g., “How Fear Distances Us from Oneness”).\n\n### **Approach 3: Spotlight Case Studies**  \n- Throughout the main text, **sidebars or breakout boxes** briefly recount crucial historical anecdotes (e.g., Galileo’s Error, the Council of Nicaea, Wahhabism & British support, etc.).  \n- These boxes function like “mini-history lessons” that enrich your broader message—without requiring a dedicated “History of Everything” chunk.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Title Ideas if You *Do* Split Off the History\n\n1. **“Where Oneness Went”**  \n   - *Subtitle:* “A Brief History of How We Lost Our Sense of Wholeness—And Why It Matters Now.”  \n\n2. **“From Hierarchy to Hedonism”**  \n   - *Subtitle:* “Tracing Europe’s Religious Power Struggles & the Rise of Individualism.”\n\n3. **“A World Unraveling”**  \n   - *Subtitle:* “Key Moments that Shaped Modern Disconnection—and How to Stitch Wholeness Back Together.”\n\nThen your main “Come Alive”-style book references that historical volume as needed.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Recommendations Based on Your Goals\n\n1. **If You Love Diving into History & Don’t Want To Sacrifice Depth:**  \n   - Write a **separate** smaller historical companion. Let it be more scholarly or thorough. In your main “Come Alive” book, you offer summarized highlights and refer to the companion for those who want the deeper dive.\n\n2. **If You Prefer One Book That Seamlessly Blends Context & Practice:**  \n   - Integrate the history as a **Part I** or as “Interludes” so that your core thesis—**“Reclaiming Our Forgotten Perception of Wholeness”**—remains central. Limit the history to the essential *turning points* that directly explain the contemporary crisis of alienation.\n\n3. **If Your Heart Says “I Must Tell the Full Story, But I Don’t Want to Lose Readers”:**  \n   - Consider **Approach 3** with short, punchy historical spotlights. You don’t have to bury your amazing research—just present it in digestible sidebars or essays within the main flow, so the grand narrative never drags.\n\n---\n\n## 6. “Come Alive (at Work)” vs. A Purely “Barakanomics” Angle\n\n- **“Come Alive”** is broader: it’s about a universal re-awakening of this **meaning faculty** in every sphere—relationships, personal growth, spirituality, and yes, business/economics.  \n  - **Pro:** Wider appeal, not pigeonholed as an economics book.  \n  - **Con:** Might be so broad that readers looking for a direct focus (e.g., “How to bring meaning into business”) could feel it’s a bit diffuse.\n\n- **“Barakanomics / The Relational Economy”** is more narrowly about **economic life** and how meaning/spiritual wholeness can reshape it.  \n  - **Pro:** Clear niche; stands out in “alternative economics” category.  \n  - **Con:** Could imply it’s only about commerce, ignoring the personal/spiritual dimension you love.\n\n**Possible Middle Ground**:  \n> “**Come Alive at Work**: How Reconnecting with Our Forgotten Faculty of Meaning Transforms Business, Economics, and Life.”  \nYou’d still have the personal dimension (and a bit of spiritual/historical analysis), but **anchor** it in the workplace and economic structures.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Final Thoughts & Suggestions\n\n- **Deciding Factors**:  \n  1. **Your Own Energy**: Do you *love* writing deep historical analysis, or does it start to feel like a chore?  \n  2. **Your Audience**: Do you foresee readers who *want* the big historical detail, or do they mostly want the “shift my worldview now” approach?  \n  3. **Your Timeline**: Writing two books vs. integrating into one is a big difference in scope.\n\n- **Hybrid Strategy**:  \n  - Write **one “Come Alive” book** that includes a 60–80 page Part I (or interwoven interludes) capturing the *key* historical leaps—just enough to illuminate why and how we became alienated.  \n  - If the historical research truly overflows, spin it into a follow-up or extended companion once you see if readers crave more details.\n\n**In short**: The historical analysis can be powerful, but it doesn’t have to bury the main message. Give it enough space to ground the reader in “This didn’t all come from nowhere,” but let the **heart of the book** be your **call to awaken the faculty of meaning/quality/essence**—because that’s what *you* seem most energized to share.",

      "content": "Below is my response in two parts. First, some thoughts on your proposed outline, and then a list of 10 “beautiful questions” that might serve as your wormhole question(s)—the deep, pulling questions that invite you (and your readers) to step into a new way of seeing and being.\n\n---\n\n### Reflections on “The Recognition Revolution” Outline\n\nYour outline is compelling and expansive. It weaves together personal experience, historical insight, and a call for societal transformation. In particular, it has these strengths:\n\n- **Personal Grounding:** Starting with a vivid, real-life story (the Russian officer trusting his inner sense over machine readings) immediately sets a tone of experiential meaning.\n- **Deep Exploration:** The sections on “The Experience of Meaning” and “Personal Awakening” invite readers to reflect on the difference between raw emotion and a deeper, direct faculty of knowing.\n- **Historical Perspective:** “The Great Forgetting” offers a historical lens to understand how we drifted from a state of oneness toward fragmentation—a crucial context for reimagining our present.\n- **Practical Transition:** By concluding with “Societal Transformation,” you promise not only a diagnosis of our current crisis but also a vision for how economics, education, politics, and environmental stewardship might be reimagined if we reclaimed that original sense of wholeness.\n\nOne possible challenge is ensuring that the historical analysis (Part II) remains tightly connected to the personal and practical insights (Parts I, III, IV) without overwhelming the reader. One way to address that is to intersperse historical “interludes” or sidebars so that the narrative flow stays personal and experiential.\n\nOverall, this outline feels like it meets your goal of building from individual recognition to collective transformation.\n\n---\n\n### 10 Beautiful (Wormhole) Questions\n\nThese questions are designed to draw the reader deeply into the exploration of meaning, connection, and transformation. They are meant to be both reflective and expansive—your “wormhole questions” that invite you to step beyond the ordinary.\n\n1. **What does it truly mean to see beauty in every moment—and how does that vision change your experience of life?**  \n   *This question challenges you to explore the transformative power of noticing beauty as the gateway to deeper unity.*\n\n2. **How can you differentiate between the fleeting pulse of emotion and the enduring voice of direct knowing?**  \n   *Here, you’re invited to discern what is ephemeral from what carries lasting wisdom.*\n\n3. **In what ways does a single moment of awe reshape your understanding of what is possible?**  \n   *This question asks you to examine how experiences of wonder can reconfigure your world view.*\n\n4. **When you pause to truly listen to your inner voice, what truths emerge about the nature of your relationships and work?**  \n   *It probes the connection between inner reflection and the quality of your external interactions.*\n\n5. **How would your life—and our society—transform if every decision honored the integration of love, beauty, and truth?**  \n   *This invites you to imagine a world where choices are guided by these deeper values rather than mere efficiency.*\n\n6. **What is the difference between merely accumulating things and cultivating a life rich in meaning and connection?**  \n   *This question contrasts quantity with quality, urging a re-evaluation of what counts as true wealth.*\n\n7. **How can embracing our collective history of both triumph and loss help us reclaim the forgotten faculty of oneness?**  \n   *This reflects on the importance of understanding our past in order to heal our present divisions.*\n\n8. **What practices can transform everyday work into an act of sacred listening and creative expression?**  \n   *Here, you’re asked to envision work as more than a series of transactions—rather, as a continuous practice of being and becoming.*\n\n9. **In what ways can a renewed awareness of our interconnectedness shift not only personal lives but the entire fabric of society?**  \n   *This question expands the focus from the individual to the societal, considering the ripple effects of inner change.*\n\n10. **If you had to name the one question that, when answered, would dissolve the boundaries between self and other, what would it be?**  \n    *This “wormhole question” is the ultimate invitation: identify that single transformative inquiry that could open the path from isolation to unity.*\n\n---\n\nEach of these questions is designed to stir deep reflection, drawing together themes of beauty, relationship, and the transformative power of a renewed perception. They serve as entry points into a journey that moves from personal recognition to broader societal change—exactly the kind of revolution your outline envisions.\n\nWhich of these questions resonates most with you, or sparks an insight that feels like the one that’s “sucking you in”?",

You’re looking for the **guiding questions** that form the backbone of *The Recognition Revolution*—the deep, structuring inquiries that drive the book’s exploration and give it direction.\n\nHere’s a list of **10 guiding questions** that could serve as the foundation for the book’s themes:\n\n---\n\n### **The Recognition Revolution: 10 Guiding Questions**  \n\n1. **What is the nature of recognition?**  \n   - What does it mean to recognize something as true, meaningful, or real?  \n   - Is recognition an emotional state, a cognitive process, or something deeper?  \n\n2. **What moments in life make us feel most alive, and why do they seem to carry a deeper reality?**  \n   - Is there a common thread between moments of awe, love, beauty, and truth?  \n   - What do these moments reveal about human perception and meaning-making?  \n\n3. **Why have we forgotten how to trust direct experience?**  \n   - How did we lose faith in intuition, wisdom, and knowing beyond rationality?  \n   - What historical, cultural, and economic forces contributed to this forgetting?  \n\n4. **How did modernity reshape the way we relate to meaning?**  \n   - Has capitalism, materialism, or scientific rationalism altered our ability to see meaning?  \n   - If rationality alone is insufficient, what else is needed for a fuller picture of reality?  \n\n5. **What distinguishes a life of quality from a life of quantity?**  \n   - How do we differentiate between experiences that nourish the soul and those that merely fill time?  \n   - What kinds of personal practices cultivate deep recognition rather than shallow distraction?  \n\n6. **How does personal awakening translate into action?**  \n   - What happens when someone starts living with a deeper awareness of meaning?  \n   - How do we avoid the trap of personal insight without societal impact?  \n\n7. **What kind of economy would emerge if we structured it around meaning, not just profit?**  \n   - Can we design systems that prioritize intrinsic fulfillment over external accumulation?  \n   - What models (historical or emerging) align economics with deeper human values?  \n\n8. **How would education change if its purpose was to help people recognize meaning?**  \n   - What would a school system look like if it taught students to perceive, interpret, and trust experiences of awe, love, and beauty?  \n   - What pedagogical approaches already point in this direction?  \n\n9. **What does it mean to live politically in a world where recognition is fragmented?**  \n   - How does political discourse change when people are disconnected from meaning?  \n   - What forms of governance could better support human flourishing at both individual and collective levels?  \n\n10. **How do we restore humanity’s relationship with nature through recognition?**  \n   - How does recognizing our interdependence with the natural world shift environmental action?  \n   - Can ecological collapse be reframed as a crisis of recognition, not just a technical or economic issue?  \n\n---\n\nThese 10 questions guide the book toward a **grand narrative** of how individuals and societies evolve when they reclaim the power of recognition. They help structure the journey from personal experience (Part I) to societal transformation (Part IV), keeping the inquiry alive throughout.  \n\nWhich of these questions feels like *the* core question pulling you into this work—the one that, if deeply explored, might reshape everything?",

      "content": "here are some questions and answers to help your guidance for a good question: I'll ask you 5 probing questions to help us discover and refine the perfect guiding question for your book.\n\nWhen you envision someone having a profound \"aha moment\" while reading your book, what exactly are they realizing? What shifts in their perception?\nYou mentioned several historical turning points (Nicene Creed, Black Death, etc.). Of all these moments, which one feels most emblematic of how we lost our connection to meaning, and why?\nIn the conversation, you spoke about your coaching practice around \"have to\" versus \"want to.\" What's the deepest insight you've witnessed when someone really gets this distinction?\nThe Russian officer story is powerful because it shows someone trusting their faculty of meaning over instruments in a life-or-death moment. What other examples (personal or historical) have deeply illustrated this faculty of meaning for you?\nIf you imagine someone finishing your book and immediately calling their closest friend, what's the one thing they're most excited to share about what they've learned?\n\nLet's start with whichever question feels most energizing to explore. Your answers will help us craft a guiding question that really captures the heart of what you're trying to convey. CopyRetryBGi think they might realize that they are not the witnesser and that the witnesser is also connected to a vast sense of meaning and knowledge etc\n1. i think each was a slow chipping away, something might come to me later as i do more research as to why even europe seemed to move away from it's \"native\" peoples most of whom live relationally to nature and each other, what were peasants doing? i think maybe the key thing is the Constantine and the empire of rome being folded together with Christianity and transforming relationality with meaning/purpose/forgiveness/etc into a mediated one where only SOME have access, instaed of all of us having access to the divine/meaning on our own. \n2. i've witnessed it in myself. this sort of grand scale sense of vertigo of being pulled up into the air, realizing that there's... something with me... that's not me, that's always there and everywhere and always always. it was scary and huge and big and i could sense that a slow trickle of that is similar to what makes different things meaningful. the source of reality is the source of all Goodness, and it was a visceral truth i felt when i connected to the witnesser\n3. i trusted my sense of rightness with my wife even if she's french and we had so much that might have been incompatible \n4. i'd wish they had a personal experiencee of meaning and are on fire to connect more with that and bring more of that into their dayEditThese are profound responses that help clarify the core of your book. Let me synthesize what I'm hearing:\nThe central revelation seems to be about discovering that we're not just our thinking mind - there's a \"witnesser\" that connects us to a deeper reality, one that's the source of meaning itself. This isn't abstract - it manifests in real decisions (like your marriage) and can be viscerally experienced (your vertigo moment).\nBased on your responses, I'll propose five potential guiding questions. Let me know which resonates most or how we might combine/modify them:\n\n\"What if you're not the witnesser, but the witnessed?\"\nThis captures the profound shift in identity you described, though it might need more context.\n\"How did we forget that meaning isn't made, but recognized?\"\nThis points to your historical analysis while suggesting possibility.\n\"What if the source of meaning isn't in our minds, but in reality itself?\"\nThis challenges materialist assumptions directly.\n\"What awakens when we realize we're not alone in our own consciousness?\"\nThis captures your vertigo moment and the universal accessibility of meaning.\n\"How did we lose direct access to meaning, and what becomes possible when we reclaim it?\"\nThis incorporates both the historical dimension (mediation of meaning through hierarchy) and the possibility of personal transformation.\n\nI'm particularly drawn to variations of #5 because it:\n\nAcknowledges the historical loss (Constantine/Christianity/hierarchy)\nImplies meaning is directly accessible to everyone\nSuggests practical possibilities\nPoints toward both personal and societal transformation\nOpens space for your coaching framework\n\nWhat aspects of these questions resonate most with your vision? We can refine or combine elements to craft the perfect guiding question.",

I love how your answers weave together personal experience, historical insight, and a deeply felt sense of something beyond the self. \n\n### Refining the Guiding Question  \n\nI think **#5**—*\"How did we lose direct access to meaning, and what becomes possible when we reclaim it?\"*—is the strongest foundation because it:  \n- Holds space for both **historical exploration** and **personal experience**  \n- Implies a **collective loss** but also an **individual rediscovery**  \n- Opens the door to **practical transformation**, rather than just theory  \n- Stays **grounded** while allowing for the mystical  \n\nBut I want to push it a little further. What if we made it even more **visceral**, something that captures the **felt sense** of your vertigo moment, the Russian officer’s decision, and the deeper shift in identity?  \n\n### Possible Revisions:\n1. **\"What if meaning isn’t something we create, but something that calls to us?\"**  \n   - This makes meaning an active force rather than just an abstract concept.  \n   - It suggests a personal *recognition* rather than an intellectual construct.  \n\n2. **\"How did we become blind to meaning, and what happens when we learn to see again?\"**  \n   - This keeps the historical forgetting but makes the rediscovery a deeply *embodied* process.  \n\n3. **\"What if the witnesser you’ve been searching for is also searching for you?\"**  \n   - This plays on your realization that the “witnesser” is something bigger than the self.  \n   - It makes the book a journey of *reciprocal recognition*.  \n\n### Which of these feels closest to the gravitational pull of your book?  \nOr do you want to fuse elements into something new?",

Mid-interview, someone asked Father Greg about the intentions for his work. He paused, then replied with disarming simplicity:\n“They’re my friends.”\nThat single line plunged me into a deep realization: I had been treating people—refugees, youth, marginalized communities—as a means to an end. Yes, the “end” was noble (jobs created, businesses launched, metrics hit), but the means were often confused between my own goals, funding, validation, and scale, hinged on chasing stories and big numbers rather than authentic human connections. I suddenly felt clear about why I had this gnawing notion that there was a disconnect between me and my work, between measurements and meaning.\nI moved more permanently to Lebanon, driven less by strategy and more by trusting a deeper calling: to truly know and be known by the people I wanted to help. Over the following years, I cultivated friendships with refugees, ex-shoe shiners, and folks living on the street. Where once I saw \"targets,\" I began to see humans with full stories.\nThat shift changed everything. It was a moment that upended my understanding of social impact. I'd been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for \"scaling impact\"—always with an eye on the next pilot or data set.\nI felt a shock of recognition, like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway. I realized that in pursuing \"doing good,\" I had been unconsciously adopting a worldview in which people became instruments for metrics: a new job created, a new training delivered, a new \"success\" story. But life is not a game, and people are not pawns. I was measuring and optimizing, yet I wasn't rooting. That single line—\"They're my friends\"—pierced me with its radical simplicity.\nAnd so I made a choice: rather than continuing my peripatetic rounds, I would anchor myself in fellowship. I put down deeper roots in Lebanon. This decision wasn’t “strategic” by typical standards; it didn’t promise massive scale on a graph. But it promised relationship—the kind that Father Greg spoke of. In stepping away from always “proving impact,” I rediscovered something I’d long neglected: the primacy of human connection over data.\n\nPart II: The Crisis in Social Impact\nMy journey might sound personal, but it highlights a wider crisis pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase scale and efficiency, they often instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change. Microfinance, for instance, started as a way to empower the poor but has sometimes devolved into aggressive loan sharking that leaves borrowers trapped in debt.\n“How you do anything is how you do everything” - Zen saying\nMany of the problems the social impact space attempts to address are related to a deeply rooted materialist understanding of reality. This leads us to see nature as resources to extract and humans as units of labor. It's as if we've set a goal to drive from Los Angeles to New York, but instead, we're going from Los Angeles to Portland... Except we're driving a tank, so it doesn't matter if our goals and destination are any \"better\" - SDGs versus profit maximization, for example. We're still going to tear up the road along the way.\n\"Bloom where you are planted.\" – Saint Francis de Sales\nNeoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong\nThe social impact world is rife with examples of good intentions gone awry when metrics are prioritized over people. Microfinance soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. But as the industry ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas, leading to tragic cases of borrower suicides in India. The metric—repayment rate—trumped any humane consideration for the poor.\nIn Palestine and the levant, international agencies pour resources into \"job creation\" for refugees and the marginalized, touting the number of short-term positions funded. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on people in the region are systemically downplayed, overshadowed by tidy employment statistics that ignore generational trauma.\nAcross the board, we chase faster gains, more significant numbers, and more impressive ratios. But in conversation after conversation, I hear a deep unease from our colleagues in the impact space—a sense that in our obsession with impact, we are losing touch with the messy, relational reality of social change.\n\nPart III: A Different Way of Seeing\nFather Greg's words offer a radical challenge to the mechanistic worldview that pervades much of the social impact space. Friendship resists objectification. Friendship isn’t about a goal in the future, it’s about a quality in the now. Friendship implies presence and empathy, refusing to hold a person at arm’s length while counting them in a tally.\nStereoscopic Vision: Both Eyes Open\nIn our quest to measure impact, we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose sight of the other eye—the one that perceives emotional truth, moral complexity, and the depth of human experience. Together, these two ways of seeing provide stereoscopic vision, revealing the nuances we'd otherwise flatten.\nIn our quest to measure impact, prove value, and access funds (often competitively with others in the “do good space”), we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. The one that loves seeing charts, even if they don’t mean much.\nIn doing so, we lose access to our other eye—the one that perceives intangible depth, emotional truth,and moral complexity. Together, these eyes provide stereoscopic vision, enabling depth perception. Without it, we see the world in 2D and might bump our heads or miss the mark.\nEye One (Metrics and Tools): We do need numbers. They can guide resource allocation and demonstrate accountability.\nEye Two (Meaning and Relationship): This eye sees the humanity behind the metrics. It recognizes that calling out genocide might matter as much as any job statistic. It sees that building a genuine friendship can be the difference between short-lived success and lasting transformation.\n“Without two eyes, we cannot perceive depth.”\n-Facts\n\nPart IV: Crafting a Garden — A New Metaphor for Impact\nIn my work, I’ve long resonated with two metaphors: “craft” and “gardening.” Lately, I’ve combined them into “crafting a garden,” which captures the delicate balance between artistry and cultivation—between carefully shaping something and letting nature unfold.\n1. Crafting a Garden: The Overall Idea\nWhen you craft something—like a potter shaping clay—you rely on skill, attention, and care. You have an intuitive sense of when the clay yields and how it wants to form. You measure, but you also feel. Similarly, a gardener sets the right conditions—soil fertility, water, sunshine—then watches growth emerge. You cannot force a seed to sprout; you can only support its natural flourishing.\nCrafting a garden merges these ideas: we pay reverent attention to every interaction (the “craft” side), while recognizing natural growth cycles (the “garden” side). We create conditions for transformation but do not rigidly control it.\n2. The Shortfalls of Factory Logic\nFactory Mindset: Standardize, mass-produce, aim for uniform outcomes on a big scale.\nGarden-Craft Mindset: Embrace diversity, local nuance, and the unpredictable beauty of living systems.\nToo often, social enterprises act like factories, chasing immediate wins without building the fertile soil of community trust. The result is a quick burst of external success—numbers—but no lasting root structure.\n3. Lessons from Craftsmanship\nA craftsperson understands:\nAttentiveness: The material (clay, wood, community) has its own story, and you must listen.\nTiming and Rhythm: Rushing can ruin the piece; waiting too long can spoil it, too. In social impact, a sense of readiness is as crucial as speed.\nEmbrace of Imperfection: Beautiful creations often bear the marks of real process, just like communities might have unique “flaws” that are actually sources of resilience.\nThis echoes how a gardener might wait out certain seasons, prune carefully, or trust the cycles of growth. When we treat a community like a “crafted garden,” we’re letting them keep their selfhood while offering supportive hands.\nSuccess at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact—drawing goals, setting metrics—but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not?\nThink about a food forest versus a factory farm. The factory farm is always waiting for the harvest, measuring inputs against projected outputs. But in the food forest, every moment is successful—even the decaying leaves in winter are doing exactly what they should. It isn’t waiting for the apples; it’s alive and successful in every moment.\n\nPart V: The Crisis of “Faster, Cheaper, Bigger”\nLet's face it: many funders, donors, and boards prefer a \"faster, cheaper, bigger\" approach. They want to see hundreds of houses built or thousands of jobs created—now. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma, building local leadership, or confronting injustice are harder to put in a bar chart.\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or build genuine relationships—as Father Greg does\n\nGenocide in Palestine: If we remain silent on the structural oppression, no number of short-term jobs will address the underlying violence.\nPost-Disaster Reconstruction: If we fail to partner intimately with the local population—crafting solutions together—our “efficiency” might yield broken or irrelevant structures in a year’s time.\nA gardener doesn’t force the seed to open by cracking it with a hammer. Instead, they ensure the soil is nutrient-rich, the sun and water are adequate, and the environment is supportive. Similarly, a craftsperson doesn’t just “shave wood faster”; they learn the wood’s grain to avoid splits and fractures.\nSustaining Long-Term Flourishing\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or take time to build genuine friendships—like Father Greg—we plant seeds that can sustain growth for decades. Short-term “scale mania” might yield impressive stats but can erode deeper bonds and obscure systemic oppression, as we see in Palestine, India, or countless other contexts. Quick wins might spike the graphs but erode community trust. Scale without soul is just another form of “mental colonization.”\n\nPart VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom — A Vision for Meaningful Work\nBloom can transform into being an organization that co-runs programs that aim to help people rediscover meaning in work and life. We used to focus on performance dashboards—like a factory. But now I’m proposing adopting the crafting-a-garden approach:\nPreparing the Soil (Community Readiness)\nInstead of imposing solutions, we spend time listening. We don’t just gather “user feedback.” We have conversations, learn local stories, and see what’s already happening under the surface.\nPlanting the Seeds (Inviting Co-Creation)\nWe collaborate with participants as partners. Instead of top-down “Here’s the solution,” we ask, “What do you envision?” We do not define “impact metrics” without them—we craft the shape together.\nTending the Garden (Sustained Support)\nLike a gardener who regularly checks moisture and weeds, we maintain ongoing relationships—coaching, reflection circles, genuine friendship. We honor participants’ autonomy and celebrate emergent growth.\nHarvesting and Sharing (Reflecting on Results)\nOf course we measure—numbers, surveys—but these metrics follow the meaning, not the other way around. We also gather stories, capturing the intangible transformations: self-confidence blossoming, communities forging new alliances, or entrepreneurs finding deeper alignment.\nOn the Edge of True Impact\nWhen we treat social impact as craft, we realize we can’t solve all problems overnight. But we can stand with communities in a lifelong posture of solidarity. We can name injustices rather than burying them under “neutral” data. In that naming, in that presence, we keep seeds of hope alive.\nImplications for Bloom:\nInstead of impact dashboards, focus on preparing the soil, planting the seeds of co-creation, and tending the garden through sustained support.\nReplace standardized programs with living apprenticeships that foster organic growth and transmission of wisdom.\nBuild technology to serve human connection, not replace it. Start with people, bring in tools only as the work demands.\nMeasure what matters: moments of meaning, quality of relationships, community vitality. Track transformation through storytelling and direct presence.\n\nWhat This Means for Our Work\nInstead of our current approach—dashboards, hockey stick projections, assessment tools—we could build like craftspeople:\nFrom Programs to Practice Spaces\nReplace fixed curriculum with living apprenticeship\nCreate conditions for natural emergence\nSupport direct transmission of wisdom\nLet timing follow organic development\nFrom Tools to Relationships\nBuild technology only when we truly have to\nStart with calling people, connecting them, figuring things out\nOnly add systems when the human work demands it\nLet tools serve connection, not replace it\nQuality recognition requires human presence\nLet technology serve connection, not replace it\nFocus on Depth Over Breadth\nBetter to work deeply with a few than superficially with many\nTrust that quality spreads naturally\nLet impact emerge from meaning\nMeasure What Matters\nTrack moments of real connection\nNotice where quality recognition develops\nDocument authentic transformation\nLet patterns emerge naturally\nThe future isn’t in better automation or control systems—it’s in better supporting our natural capacity to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true. Everything else follows from that.\nMaking Measurement Serve Life\nHere’s what this could look like:\nInstead of measuring:\nPlatform engagement\nGrowth projections\nImpact metrics\nResource utilization\nWe measure:\nMoments of meaning\nQuality of relationships\nWisdom transmission\nCommunity vitality\nThe key isn’t just changing what we measure, but how we measure: through direct relationship, story, observation, and community, not just data extraction.\n\nA Different Kind of Economy\nThis isn’t about rejecting markets or metrics entirely. It’s about putting them in service of life. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning. When we do this:\nQuality naturally reduces waste\nRelationship naturally builds resilience\nMeaning naturally guides growth\nBeauty naturally creates value\nWe can pioneer an economy that affirms our humanity rather than exploits it. Where craft and care matter more than extraction and scale. Where honoring the uniqueness of people and place generates abundance for all.\n\nPart VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\nA Different Way Forward\nWhy does a materialist approach lead to so many issues? Because it fundamentally doesn’t acknowledge that humans have access to goodness within them and therefore must be controlled. The world is scary, so we need more knowledge, more science, more data, more control to put it under our command is the answer, although there is much we don’t know and this statement itself is full of hubris.\n\nThe unwritten belief is that life is nasty brutish and short (Hobbes), we can only know our mind and the world is “out there”(Descartes), the out there world is described by mathematics (Galileo), evolution describes our behavior (Darwin) and it’s survival of the fittest. These understandings lead to seeing people as mechanistic objects that can be tracked, manipulated, and controlled. That those who are smart and kind need to enact systems of control that ensure we don’t have the 30 years war again, and religion is bad, BTW, so is God and spirituality and all the stuff that probably led up to all the violence. The issue is the baby we threw out with the bathwater is the thing that gives us access to intuitive knowledge(which is a form of knowledge), insight, meaning, access to quality, goodness, truth, beauty, and knowing it when we see it. It closed one of our eyes.\nWeaving it Together: The examples of Buurtzorg and Sounds True illustrate how we might live out the principles of the crafted garden in our organizations. By privileging quality over control and wisdom over sheer scale, these pioneers point toward a new paradigm—one that the social impact world desperately needs.\nGrounding the Vision: What could this look like in practice? Imagine a social enterprise that apprentices local youth in green building, teaching both technical and relational skills. They construct eco-homes not through a cookie-cutter blueprint, but by truly understanding the landscape and the community's dreams. The organization tracks not just houses built, but the confidence and leadership that blossoms in the youth. Funders receive not just data points, but rich stories of transformation. This is impact with the intimacy of a garden and the integrity of a well-crafted structure.\nI’ve had deep doubts about the social impact space, especially after reading Winners Take All and realizing that what we’re doing isn’t what we’re talking about. We’re not saving the world—we’re helping people find community, develop confidence, learn, grow, find agency. We’re not even really helping them establish financially successful exponential businesses, because we don’t embody that. We embody something that matters to many, yet we’re not clear about that. Instead, we pretend to sell other things, and that tension hurts.\nThis isn’t abstract theory—there are organizations showing a different way forward. Buurtzorg in the Netherlands eliminated all management and metrics-based control, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country. Or Sounds True, which built a $60M publishing company by trusting both business acumen and deeper wisdom, proving that spiritual values can drive real success.\nThese aren’t just nice stories—they point toward a fundamentally different way of working that honors quality recognition and craft. When I say craft, I don’t just mean artisanal products. I mean any work that:\nDevelops through direct relationship and apprenticeship\nValues mastery and depth alongside innovation\nCreates containers for meaningful work to emerge\nTrusts people’s natural capacity to recognize quality\nSo how do we shift from metrics mania to crafting a garden?\nPractice Stereoscopic Vision\nKeep your metrics if they help you see part of reality. But never lose the second eye: the moral, relational, or spiritual dimension that sees goodness, truth, beauty and possibilities for friendship.\nName Reality Clearly\nAvoid euphemisms. If it’s genocide, call it genocide. If microfinance turns exploitative, say so openly. Authentic relationships thrive on honesty, not polite obfuscation.\nSlow Down to Go Deeper\nSlowing the pace allows you to “listen to the clay,” to sense a community’s soul. Rushing might create short-term outputs but often yields shallow or harmful outcomes.\nTrust the Process of Craft\nAccept that not everything can be a linear blueprint. Gardening has seasons; some seeds fail. Craft has trial and error; sometimes the material cracks. This is growth, not a series of guaranteed leaps.\nAdopt the Gardener’s Long View\nA gardener invests in the soil, knowing real harvests may come years later—or bless future generations. In social impact, facing crises that range from genocide to climate disasters, we must hold a long-range vision. Even small acts of genuine friendship, alignment with our perception of beauty, can ripple beyond our immediate horizon.\n\nA Moment for Reflection\nWhat tension do you feel when pressured for quick results?\nWhich relationships in your work might you deepen rather than “scale”?\nWhere might you stand in truth—calling out systemic violence or injustice—rather than quietly conforming to funder-friendly narratives?\nAsking these questions is an act of reclaiming our second eye—the one that perceives depth and moral texture. It’s a necessary counterpart to the first eye of data analysis.\n\nConclusion: Trusting the Seeds, Crafting the Garden\nFather Greg Boyle’s line—“They’re my friends”—remains a beacon for me. It teaches that relationship can’t be an afterthought. No matter how refined our metrics or how lofty our proposals, if we lose sight of shared humanity, we drift into the same mechanistic mindset we intended to oppose.\nCrafting a garden of social impact means:\nTending relationships like precious seedlings.\nUsing skilled, attentive “craft” to shape solutions with communities, cultivating the context in the present moment - anticipating the “impact” in the future like a gardener planting seeds in the spring hopes for tomatoes in the summer, yet can’t ensure it.\n\n\nThis is not an easy path. Gardens demand consistent care; craft demands repeated practice and humility. But it’s the only path I’ve found that truly integrates rational analysis with moral imagination. We don’t discard numbers—we simply refuse to make them our God. Instead, we combine metrics with love, data with empathy, and structure with spirit. That is the heart of stereoscopic vision—two ways of seeing that yield a deeper perception of reality.\nIn the end, what we grow—in ourselves and our communities—may far surpass the limited ambitions of simple “outputs” and “outcomes.” We may witness genuine healing, solidarity, and creative flourishing where once only a graph or a donor report existed. We may craft gardens so fertile with attention, compassion, and truth that entire communities not only survive but truly come alive.\nAnd that, I believe, is what real impact looks like.\n\nFinal Thought\nWhen we stand next to someone—whether a refugee, a farmer crushed by debt, or a family in Palestine facing daily violence—and say, “You are not my data point; you are my friend,” we enact the very transformation we hope to see in the world. We show that life isn’t a mechanical series of inputs and outputs, but a shared tapestry of stories, joys, and struggles.\nMay we all become craftspeople and gardeners of this new paradigm—humans who measure thoughtfully but love wholeheartedly, who plant seeds of change with skilled hands and open hearts, cultivating relationships that outlast any spreadsheet.\nConclusion: Success at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact, but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way? Think of a food forest—it’s successful in every moment, even in winter’s decay. It isn’t waiting for harvest to declare success. Similarly, real transformation emerges when we let quality recognition guide us at each step, rather than fixating on some distant “scalable” end.\n“We can’t take down the master’s house with the master’s tools. We need to trust in something deeper.”\nMaybe we start small, document what emerges when we trust this process, build evidence through real stories of transformation, and let the work speak for itself. We could become gardeners—crafting conditions for people to come alive—rather than assembly-line managers producing forced outcomes.\nI believe we can pioneer a different way of working: trust quality recognition first, build like gardeners, develop through relationship and practice, and measure only what truly serves beauty. This approach might feel risky, but it leads to more authentic impact—one that sustains people’s dignity and fosters real transformation.\nThat, in essence, is what I think social impact can be. By trusting the deeper capacity in all of us to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true, we can finally step beyond hollow metrics into the living reality of meaningful work.",

The shift from *metrics to meaning*, from *factory logic to craft*, and from *instrumentalizing people to truly seeing them* is a compelling framework. Your writing is already structured in a way that lends itself to a book outline, but I think the key is distilling it into a single **guiding question** that drives the narrative.\n\n### Finding the Core Guiding Question  \nThe heartbeat of your book seems to be **reclaiming direct, relational, and embodied ways of knowing and acting in the world, rather than deferring to systems of measurement, abstraction, and control.**  \n\nHere are some guiding questions that emerge from your themes:\n\n1. **What if the greatest impact isn’t something we measure, but something we cultivate?**  \n   - This shifts the focus from external validation to lived, relational transformation.  \n\n2. **How did we lose our ability to recognize what is truly meaningful, and how do we get it back?**  \n   - This brings in the historical forgetting, the dominance of materialist logic, and the need for reclaiming direct perception.  \n\n3. **What if real impact isn’t about numbers at all, but about relationships?**  \n   - This question challenges the foundational assumptions of the social impact sector.  \n\n4. **How do we stop treating life as a problem to be solved and start living it as a garden to be tended?**  \n   - This ties directly to your gardening metaphor and resists the mechanistic, top-down approach.  \n\n5. **What happens when we shift from trying to change the world to being fully present with it?**  \n   - This points toward the power of presence, relationality, and the shift from *doing* to *being*.  \n\n### Refining the Book’s Structure  \nYour essay already suggests a strong structure for a book, but I see the need to **weave in the deeper philosophical and historical roots** while keeping it personal and accessible. Here’s a possible refined outline:  \n\n#### **The Recognition Revolution: From Metrics to Meaning**  \n**Part I: The Moment That Changed Everything**  \n- The Father Greg Boyle story and your realization  \n- The shift from *doing good* to *being with*  \n- How the social impact sector lost its way  \n\n**Part II: The Crisis of Measurement**  \n- How metrics became a false god  \n- The limits of rationality and materialist logic  \n- The factory mindset vs. the gardener mindset  \n- The historical forgetting: When did we start deferring to systems over direct knowing? (Tying in Constantine, the Scientific Revolution, capitalism, and their impact on our ability to recognize meaning)  \n\n**Part III: Reclaiming Direct Recognition**  \n- Friendship as a way of knowing  \n- Stereoscopic vision: Holding both data and direct experience  \n- Practices for cultivating quality recognition  \n- Lessons from craft, gardening, and indigenous wisdom  \n\n**Part IV: A New Paradigm of Impact**  \n- Economics beyond extraction: What does *meaningful work* actually look like?  \n- Education as apprenticeship, not factory schooling  \n- Politics renewed: Can governance be relational instead of bureaucratic?  \n- How we measure what matters (or should we stop measuring?)  \n\n**Conclusion: Success at Every Step**  \n- Living by what we recognize as true  \n- Letting meaning guide measurement, not the other way around  \n- Becoming gardeners instead of factory managers  \n- The final invitation: shifting from \"impact\" to **presence**  \n\n### The Core Question that Guides the Book  \nThe best guiding question should be one that feels **urgent** to you—one that you **can’t not** write about.  \n\nDoes **one of these questions feel like it pulls at you most?** Or would you like to modify one?",

Each question is a doorway into the book’s core themes.\n\n### **Part I: The Crisis of Recognition**\n1. **What if meaning isn’t something we create, but something we recognize?**\n   - This challenges the modern assumption that meaning is *produced* rather than *perceived*—linking to your \"witnesser\" insight.\n\n2. **How did we lose our ability to trust direct knowing?**\n   - This dives into **The Great Forgetting**, exploring history, materialism, and the shift from direct perception to mediated systems.\n\n3. **Why do we measure impact, and what do we lose in the process?**\n   - This sets up the critique of social impact, rationalism, and the obsession with measurement.\n\n### **Part II: The False Promises of Measurement**\n4. **What if rationality alone is not enough to guide us?**\n   - This tackles the **limits of materialism, data, and Enlightenment thinking**—showing why \"pure rationality\" is blind to meaning.\n\n5. **How does seeing people as numbers turn us into the very systems we seek to change?**\n   - This critiques the NGO, philanthropic, and development sectors that dehumanize people in the name of \"helping\" them.\n\n6. **Can an economy based on meaning, rather than extraction, actually work?**\n   - This moves toward practical applications—rethinking work, money, and social impact through a lens of meaning.\n\n### **Part III: Reclaiming Direct Recognition**\n7. **What does it mean to see with two eyes—rationality and recognition?**\n   - This introduces your **stereoscopic vision** concept—seeing both *metrics* and *meaning* at once.\n\n8. **What happens when we shift from trying to change the world to being fully present with it?**\n   - This challenges activism and impact culture—pointing to **craft, friendship, and presence** as deeper forms of change.\n\n9. **How do we measure what matters—without losing what matters?**\n   - A paradox: how do we keep accountability while resisting control?\n\n### **Part IV: The New Way Forward**\n10. **What if success isn’t a future goal, but something present in every moment?**\n   - This ties into your **gardening metaphor**—the idea that real success isn’t in some distant metric, but in the **quality of each step**.\n\n---\n\n## **Book Structure: Unified & Refined**\n### **Part I: The Great Forgetting**\n- How we lost **direct recognition of meaning**\n- How **measurement, control, and systems replaced trust in direct experience**\n- Historical shifts: Constantine, the Scientific Revolution, Capitalism\n- The emergence of **metrics-based meaning** (the factory mindset)\n\n### **Part II: The False Promises of Rationality & Measurement**\n- How the **NGO/social impact sector became a mirror of capitalism**\n- Why **data and metrics aren’t neutral**\n- The **blind spots of \"rational\" approaches to impact**\n- The **problem of treating humans as instruments for our goals**\n- The **limits of optimization, measurement, and goal-seeking behavior**\n\n### **Part III: Reclaiming Meaning Through Direct Recognition**\n- **Friendship as an alternative to impact metrics** (Father Greg Boyle)\n- **Craft, gardening, and apprenticeship as models for change**\n- **Learning to trust the second eye—the eye of recognition**\n- **How to shift from measurement to presence**\n\n### **Part IV: The New Paradigm—Crafting a Garden of Meaning**\n- **How we build organizations, economies, and lives that prioritize meaning**\n- **Practical shifts: replacing dashboards with human presence**\n- **Scaling depth rather than breadth**\n- **The future of work: from extraction to craft**\n- **Final reflections: success at every step**\n\n---\n\n## **What This Gives You:**\n- A **single, unified book** instead of two separate ones\n- A **clear driving question** (or set of guiding questions)\n- A **structured journey** from historical loss → critique of rationalism → reclaiming recognition → practical transformation\n- A **strong ending that feels applicable, not just philosophical**\n\n---\n\n## **Next Steps:**\n1. **Which of the 10 questions resonates most with you?**  \n   - One of them may need to be the *core question* that shapes everything else.\n\n2. **Does this merged structure feel aligned with your vision?**  \n   - Would you like to tweak any sections or add anything?\n\n3. **Title thoughts?**  \n   - Do any of the suggested titles feel right, or do you have a new one in mind?\n\nThis book feels **urgent, necessary, and deeply personal.** Let’s make it something that speaks **directly to the people who need it most.**",

      "content": "Below is a synthesized analysis of your structure options, along with key questions to help decide which approach best aligns with your core purpose of helping people recognize and trust their faculty of meaning.\n\n---\n\n## **Structure Options Overview**\n\n### **Structure Type 1: Single Book with Historical Focus**  \n**Title:** \"From Metrics to Meaning: Reclaiming Our Lost Faculty of Recognition\"  \n- **Parts:**  \n  1. The Great Forgetting (Historical analysis)  \n  2. The False Promises (Current crisis)  \n  3. Reclaiming Recognition (The way forward)  \n  4. Living in Beauty (Practical application)  \n- **Strengths:**  \n  - Offers a comprehensive narrative arc grounded in history.  \n  - Provides an academic context for how we drifted from direct recognition of meaning.  \n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - Risk of becoming too academic and losing the reader’s connection with practical, everyday applications.\n\n---\n\n### **Structure Type 2: Single Book with Personal Journey Focus**  \n**Title:** \"Two Eyes Open: A Journey from Fixing to Recognizing\"  \n- **Parts:**  \n  1. The Religion of Progress (Personal story)  \n  2. The Language of Beauty (Discovery)  \n  3. Living in Beauty (Integration)  \n- **Strengths:**  \n  - Deeply personal and emotionally engaging.  \n  - The narrative is clear and intimate, inviting the reader to experience your transformation.  \n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - May sacrifice some historical depth and broader theoretical context.  \n  - Could appear overly personal if not balanced with universal insights.\n\n---\n\n### **Structure Type 3: Two-Book Approach**  \n- **Book 1:** \"Where Oneness Went: A History of How We Lost Our Faculty of Meaning\"  \n  - Focus: Historical analysis, philosophical foundations, and the current crisis.  \n- **Book 2:** \"Come Alive: Practical Ways to Reclaim Recognition\"  \n  - Focus: Personal journey, practical applications, and future possibilities.  \n- **Strengths:**  \n  - Clear separation between theory (history/philosophy) and practice.  \n  - Allows you to target different audiences more precisely.  \n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - Message might feel fragmented across two volumes.  \n  - Extra writing and coordination required to maintain coherence between the two works.\n\n---\n\n### **Structure Type 4: Question-Driven Approach**  \n**Title:** \"The Recognition Revolution: From Metrics to Meaning\"  \n- **Structure:**  \n  - Organize chapters around ten core guiding questions that drive the narrative, with each chapter exploring one question through theory, history, and practice.  \n- **Strengths:**  \n  - Provides clear, engaging structure and natural entry points for readers.  \n  - Encourages active reflection as each question invites both personal and systemic inquiry.  \n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - Risk of feeling formulaic if each chapter is too rigidly tied to a question.  \n  - May need careful narrative weaving to ensure a coherent overall story.\n\n---\n\n### **Structure Type 5: Metaphor-Based Approach**  \n**Title:** \"Seeing with Both Eyes: A Guide to Recognition\"  \n- **Framework:**  \n  - Organized around core metaphors (e.g., Two Eyes, The Bird, The Bell, The Tightrope, The Garden) that represent different aspects of your thesis.  \n- **Strengths:**  \n  - Memorable and vivid; metaphors can make abstract ideas tangible.  \n  - Offers natural integration of personal, historical, and practical dimensions.  \n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - Could lean too much into poetic language and risk losing concrete business or practical takeaways.  \n  - Might feel less accessible to readers seeking clear, step-by-step guidance.\n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation: A Hybrid Approach (Combining Types 2 and 4)**\n\n**Proposed Title:**  \n\"Two Eyes Open: A Journey from Fixing to Recognizing\"\n\n**Structure Outline:**  \n- **Introduction:**  \n  - Establish the problem: how modern systems (metrics, pure rationality) have distanced us from direct, relational meaning.  \n  - Introduce the “two eyes” concept: one eye for data/measurement and one for direct recognition of beauty, truth, and connection.\n\n- **Part I: The Crisis of Recognition**  \n  - Chapters built around key questions that weave your personal journey with historical insights (e.g., How did we lose our direct access to meaning? How did systems like those born of Constantine’s fusion with Christianity change our relationship with the divine?).\n\n- **Part II: Awakening and Reclamation**  \n  - Chapters exploring your personal “aha” moments (e.g., Father Greg Boyle’s story, the Russian officer’s trust in his inner faculty) and how these moments reveal a forgotten capacity for direct recognition.  \n  - Each chapter can be structured around one core question, inviting the reader to reflect deeply.\n\n- **Part III: From Recognition to Action**  \n  - Practical chapters focused on shifting from “have-to” to “want-to,” cultivating craft (like the gardener or the artisan), and integrating these practices into daily work and social impact.  \n  - Use your guiding questions to explore how to transform personal awakening into societal transformation.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - Envisioning a new paradigm for work, social impact, and even economics—where meaning, relationship, and presence guide our actions.\n\n**Why This Hybrid Works:**  \n- **Emotional Engagement & Personal Narrative:** Your personal story drives the narrative, making it accessible and relatable.  \n- **Guiding Questions:** Each chapter’s question gives clear structure and invites active reflection, keeping the reader engaged.  \n- **Integrated History:** The historical analysis is woven throughout, ensuring intellectual depth without overwhelming the practical side.  \n- **Metaphors as Illustrators:** While not the primary structure, metaphors can be used within chapters to illustrate complex ideas (e.g., the “two eyes” concept, the garden of life, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## **Key Questions to Guide Your Final Decision**\n\n1. **Audience Focus:**  \n   - **Do you want to prioritize academic/historical credibility, or practical accessibility?**  \n     (If you lean toward practitioners and everyday transformation, a hybrid personal/question-driven approach may resonate more.)\n\n2. **Core Message Integrity:**  \n   - **Is the personal journey robust enough to carry both the historical context and the practical applications?**  \n     (Ensure that your own “aha” moments and real-life examples are interlaced with the larger systemic critique.)\n\n3. **Narrative Flow vs. Structural Clarity:**  \n   - **Would a chapter-by-chapter question approach maintain a coherent, compelling narrative, or would it risk feeling too formulaic?**  \n     (Reflect on whether your audience will be drawn into a reflective journey or if they prefer a more narrative-driven progression.)\n\n4. **Integration of Historical Analysis:**  \n   - **How important is it for you to include deep historical analysis, and how can it be integrated without losing the immediacy of your personal story?**  \n     (Decide if history is a constant thread or if it can serve as contextual “interludes” to support your main message.)\n\n5. **The Ultimate “Aha” Moment:**  \n   - **Which guiding question best encapsulates the transformation you hope your readers will experience?**  \n     (For example: “How did we lose our ability to recognize meaning, and what happens when we learn to see again?” might be refined further to suit your style.)\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nYour work is rich with personal insight, historical depth, and practical wisdom. The ideal unified book should help readers see that:\n- **We have forgotten our innate capacity for direct recognition and relational connection,**  \n- **Modern metrics and systems have replaced genuine, embodied meaning,** and  \n- **By reclaiming our “second eye” (our faculty for deep recognition), we can transform our personal lives, our work, and our society.**\n\nI hope this analysis helps clarify your path forward. Which aspects stand out to you as most essential? What tweaks or additional elements would you want to incorporate into this hybrid approach?",

Also people feel that things are insane and messed up and i feel like it would be nice to start with some AHA moments going through history being like, ooooh ok, now i know why capitalism is the way it is and why we \"won\" by taking over the world, domesticating crops and colonizing the planet (western europe) - these ideas come from somewhere and the ugliness of the colonization process and the way that they saw some people as lesser and nature as a resource to be plundered is still the operating mindset - the worldview hasn't changed it just has become different, including plundering your own time and taking advantage of your own life for the \"Good Life\" except people don't know what good life is anymore, their fruits taste like nothing and their vegetables have year on year been losing more and more nutrients, there's a reason, it's all a sign and communication if you're in relationship. instead they double down on dominatino and see the way to fix it is to create organizations that promise fixing the world with technology and greater control. really a lot of this is about leaning towards or leaning away. emotions that push or states which draw near and thinking we can control rather than acknolwedging after hundreds of years that we don't know and the more we try to fix the scribbled drawing where we colored outside the lines we can't get the color to go back in. We can't fix it, it's not like a bone in a living system, where a doctor can do something and work with the body so the bone heals, the more we strip the features like a factory farm the less it's connected and in interrelationship. i think that's why it is already dead and why people literally die of loneliness. my grandma was a vital woman full of life till covid stuck her at home and she couldn't engage with people or go to weddings and dance, she developed dementia and declined rapidly after that. It's being in your right place in relationship with all things and seeing it that way rather than buying an island in new zealand and trying to protect yoruself from the climate collapse you're probably a big part of contributing to -like some billionaires. There's a reason people don't like billionaires, they usually have to become things no one wants to be (or inherit it) \n\nLet's take all this content and my feelings and i'd love you to give me some no-nonesense coaching advice, you're fed up and tired and you want to help me get the outline structuerd so i can go writie. you seen alot of my writing and essays and what i just wrote here. how can i help order that into a book. i do ilke the idea of each chapter having a question that maybe i answer and the book itself being a question instead of a title that the whole set of questions help answer \nreview, refine, update and offer the outline chapter headings pros and cons and potential audiences that might be the right people to read thi sot have the impact i want",

      "content": "Below is some **no-nonsense coaching** to help you distill your copious insights and passionate energy into a structured, question-driven book outline. I’ll give you:\n\n1. A **proposed outline** that uses guiding questions to anchor each chapter.  \n2. **Pros and cons** of this structure.  \n3. Suggested **audiences** who’d be most impacted by your book.\n\nMy tone is direct and practical—think of it as a friendly tough-love session that moves you from messy brainstorming to an actionable blueprint.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Proposed Outline**\n\n### **Working Title (Question-Driven)**  \n**“Where Did We Go Wrong? — And How We Reclaim Our Lost Sense of Wholeness”**  \n*(You can refine the title later, but the key is that the entire book is framed as a big question you’re answering.)*\n\n**Introduction:**  \n- **Scene-Setter:** Briefly describe the “insanity” of modern life—loneliness, diminishing food quality, exploitative capitalism, climate chaos.  \n- **Big Question:** “Where did we go wrong?” Pose the main question of the entire book, letting readers know you’ll explore how a forgotten faculty of ‘direct recognition’ can help us see and live differently.\n\n---\n\n### **Part I: The Long Drift into Disconnection**\n\n**Chapter 1 Question:**  \n**“How Did We End Up in Such a Mess, and Why Does It Feel So Wrong?”**  \n- **Hook:** Start with a personal anecdote or a vivid example from your writing (e.g., your grandmother’s decline during COVID, or the billionaire “escape to New Zealand” story).  \n- **Key Points:**  \n  - Sketch the everyday insanity: exploitation of self, others, and nature.  \n  - Introduce the concept of “losing relationship” with ourselves and the world.  \n  - Foreshadow the historical backstory you’ll dive into next.\n\n**Chapter 2 Question:**  \n**“What Historical Forces Created This Worldview of Control and Domination?”**  \n- **Key Points:**  \n  - Rapidly trace the shift from older relational worldviews to hierarchical/colonial mindsets (Constantine, colonization, Enlightenment rationalism, scientific revolution).  \n  - Show how materialism took root: humans as units, nature as resource.  \n  - Highlight how we internalize colonizing logic—even colonizing our own time and bodies.\n\n**Chapter 3 Question:**  \n**“Why Can’t We Just ‘Fix’ Things with More Control and Technology?”**  \n- **Key Points:**  \n  - Critique the Western approach of doubling down on solutions that emphasize control.  \n  - Introduce your metaphor of “scribbling outside the lines” and the impossibility of simply erasing and re-drawing.  \n  - Emphasize how living systems (like a bone healing) require respect for inherent processes, not brute-force.  \n  - End with the rising question: “So if we can’t fix it by more control, then what?”\n\n*(Outcome: By the end of Part I, readers see that there’s a deep worldview problem, historically rooted, that has led us to where we are.)*\n\n---\n\n### **Part II: Rediscovering Our Lost Faculty of Recognition**\n\n**Chapter 4 Question:**  \n**“What Have We Forgotten—And How Does Direct Recognition Work?”**  \n- **Key Points:**  \n  - Define the “second eye”—the capacity for direct knowing, relational seeing.  \n  - Give personal or real-life anecdotes (like your “aha” with Father Greg Boyle or the Russian officer story).  \n  - Show the difference between intellectual knowledge and embodied recognition.  \n  - Begin illustrating how presence and relationship become crucial.\n\n**Chapter 5 Question:**  \n**“If We’re So Disconnected, Why Do We Yearn for Meaning?”**  \n- **Key Points:**  \n  - Explore the universal longing that arises in crises—why are people searching for “the good life” but finding emptiness?  \n  - Connect to examples: nutrient-deficient food, loneliness, exploitative jobs.  \n  - Show how these are “signs and communications” from a living system that we’ve overlooked.  \n  - Emphasize that *yearning* is a clue we still have some residue of direct recognition.\n\n---\n\n### **Part III: Living Differently (Personal and Collective)**\n\n**Chapter 6 Question:**  \n**“Can One Person Really Defy This System—and How?”**  \n- **Key Points:**  \n  - “Have-to vs. Want-to” approach—introduce your practical coaching or personal framework.  \n  - Illustrate small daily shifts that reconnect you to meaning: from how you eat to how you show up at work.  \n  - Offer examples of people “leaning away” from the madness and “leaning towards” deeper presence, e.g., a friend who left a corporate job to start a local craft or community space.\n\n**Chapter 7 Question:**  \n**“What Happens When We Apply This ‘Second Eye’ to Business and Social Impact?”**  \n- **Key Points:**  \n  - Summarize your “From Metrics to Meaning” arguments: the crisis of measure mania, the illusions of philanthropic “fixes,” the difference between short-term scale vs. deep relational impact.  \n  - Weave in your “gardening and craft” metaphors: success at every step, soil-building, relationship-based emergence.  \n  - Offer practical shifts organizations can make: moving from performance dashboards to real community relationships, small scale, co-creation.\n\n**Chapter 8 Question:**  \n**“What Would an Economy of Recognition Look Like?”**  \n- **Key Points:**  \n  - Dream a bit: illustrate how an economy aligned with direct recognition rethinks ownership, scale, time.  \n  - Mention alternative economic models (e.g., Buurtzorg, living wage movements, indigenous communal frameworks).  \n  - Reiterate that it’s not about utopia, but about re-centering relationships, meaning, and awe in how we work.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: “Is a Life of Meaning Possible Now?”**\n\n**Key Points:**  \n- Summarize the journey: We discovered how we got here (Part I), recognized a lost faculty (Part II), and explored how to live and work differently (Part III).  \n- Final call: living in alignment *today*, not waiting for “tomorrow’s solution.”  \n- Emphasize “success at every step”—the food forest metaphor.  \n- Encourage readers to keep asking questions and trusting that “second eye.”\n\n*(Outcome: A close that invites ongoing reflection and practical experimentation, leaving the reader inspired to integrate these insights into their own lives.)*\n\n---\n\n## **2. Pros & Cons of This Outline**\n\n### **Pros**\n- **Clarity & Engagement:** Each chapter’s question instantly signals the focus, drawing readers in.  \n- **Historical Thread Without Overload:** You weave key historical elements into Part I without turning the entire book into an academic tome.  \n- **Personal + Systemic Balance:** Part II and III connect personal revelations (recognition) with broader social/economic structures.  \n- **Practical Takeaways:** Each question can end with a reflection or small practice to anchor the theoretical points.\n\n### **Cons**\n- **Risk of Formulaic Feel:** If you’re not careful, a question-per-chapter format can become repetitive.  \n  - **Mitigation:** Vary your tone, use stories, and interject personal anecdotes.  \n- **Deep Historical Detail Trimmed Down:** You might have to pick and choose which historical examples matter most rather than exhaustively exploring them.  \n- **Potentially Fewer “Story Arcs”** if you don’t weave your personal journey throughout (like Type 2 structure).  \n  - **Mitigation:** Begin each chapter with a short personal or historical anecdote to keep it lively.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Potential Audiences**\n\n1. **Social Impact / Nonprofit Leaders**  \n   - People frustrated with “metrics mania” who suspect there’s a deeper way of fostering change.  \n   - **Impact Desired:** They rethink how they plan and measure success, embracing relational approaches.\n\n2. **Individuals Burned Out by Hustle Culture**  \n   - People sensing that controlling or “optimizing” everything leads to emptiness.  \n   - **Impact Desired:** They find a path to reclaim direct connection, presence, and everyday meaning.\n\n3. **Seekers of Spiritual or Philosophical Depth**  \n   - Readers who want a deeper, less materialist worldview but also practical steps for living it out.  \n   - **Impact Desired:** They integrate the “second eye” more actively into daily decisions.\n\n4. **Conscious Capitalists or Regenerative Economy Enthusiasts**  \n   - Folks exploring alternative economics (e.g., those enthralled by permaculture, localism, solidarity economies).  \n   - **Impact Desired:** They shift from purely rational “business for good” to relational, craft-based, or “food forest” mindsets.\n\n5. **University and Graduate Students**  \n   - Particularly those in sustainability, development, or entrepreneurship programs.  \n   - **Impact Desired:** They see a bigger picture beyond the usual frameworks, maybe adopting it for future projects.\n\n---\n\n## **Final No-Nonsense Advice**\n\n1. **Just Start Writing:** Don’t wait for everything to be perfect. Your voice becomes clearer with each draft.  \n2. **Select the *Essential* Historical Bits:** Resist the urge to detail every turning point. Include just enough to produce that “aha” for why modern Western societies turned so exploitative.  \n3. **Weave Personal Stories Everywhere:** Pepper each chapter with short anecdotes or experiences that keep the reader emotionally hooked.  \n4. **End Each Chapter with a Reflection or Practice:** E.g., “Ask yourself: Where do I rely on control vs. trust?” or “What’s one relationship you can cultivate instead of measure this week?”  \n5. **Stay Open to Mid-Course Adjustments:** Your chapters may evolve as you write. Keep the question structure flexible enough to shift headings or combine chapters if new insights emerge.  \n6. **Be Ruthless in Editing:** This topic can balloon. Cut anything that doesn’t serve your guiding questions.  \n7. **Trust Your Own ‘Second Eye’:** Let your sense of resonance guide which stories or facts to keep. If it feels stale, the reader will feel it too.\n\n**You’ve Got This.** You have a strong sense of the problem (“insanity of modern life,” the historical roots, the false promise of more control) and the potential solution (the “second eye,” relational living, measuring less and meaning more). This outline helps you deliver that message in a way that’s both intellectually robust and emotionally compelling. \n\nNow, go write—and trust that each page helps readers see with both eyes.",

      "content": "*Rolls up sleeves and speaks directly*\n\nLook, you've got powerful content here but you're getting caught in perfectionist loops trying to structure it. Here's what I see:\n\nYour book is essentially answering one big question: \"Why does everything feel so wrong, and what can we do about it?\"\n\nLet me break this down practically:\n\n1. HOOK: Start with the insanity people feel RIGHT NOW:\n- Climate anxiety\n- Meaningless work\n- Tasteless fruits\n- Dead inside while \"succeeding\"\n- Billionaires building bunkers while the world burns\n\n2. Then give them the AHA historical moments that explain how we got here:\n- Constantine merging church/state = meaning becomes controlled\n- Black Death = individualism rises\n- Scientific Revolution = only numbers matter\n- Industrial Revolution = everything becomes a resource\n- Silicon Valley = \"fixing the world\" becomes a religion\n\n3. Show how this creates THREE BIG PROBLEMS:\n- Personal (disconnection from meaning)\n- Social (metrics over humanity)\n- Ecological (nature as resource)\n\n4. Then reveal your core insight: We have TWO EYES\n- One sees quantity (metrics, data, control)\n- One sees quality (meaning, beauty, relationship)\n- We've been stumbling around with one eye closed\n\n5. Finally, show what becomes possible when we use both eyes:\n- Personal alignment\n- Real social impact\n- Ecological harmony\n\nStructure it as 12 chapters, each opening with a question that builds on the previous answer. Start each chapter with a story (yours or historical) that makes the point visceral.\n\nThe overarching question could be: \"What if our crisis isn't about fixing the world, but about learning to see it whole again?\"\n\nWant me to sketch out the 12 specific chapter questions that would build this case? We can make each one hit hard and clear while building toward your core message.\n\nRemember: Don't try to say everything. Make ONE clear argument about TWO eyes and our need to reclaim the second one. Everything else should support that.\n\nHow's that for straight talk? Want me to get more specific about any part?\nsolve all the cons. I think perhaps we need to make clear the idea that worldview leads to patterns, that the patterns we see when we change what we're doing \"normal capitalism\" to \"social capitalism\" and then realizing we get similar results implies that the results are related to the way of seeing and the way of doing. if our backs hurt after a long day at the computer working on social media and we decide to spend a long day at the computer working on ... coding... it wont prevent the back pain,w e need ot do something //different// and it's hard to see someitmes. i think i sort of want tomake that clear because that was a big aha for me. that w edon't see things as they are we see them through our schemas and worldviews \n\nGive some guided questions pushing us towards important gaps to fill and recommendations that will strengthen the book ",

      "content": "Alright, here’s **straight talk** and **practical guidance** to sharpen your book so it addresses the big question (and all its spinoffs) without bloating or losing readers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Argument & Through-Line\n\nYou’ve got a **single, powerful argument** that everything traces back to **the worldview** we adopt. We’re stuck in a mechanistic, controlling worldview that:\n\n- Sees people (and nature) as resources to manage or fix,  \n- Measures success with numbers alone,  \n- Ignores or undervalues **quality**, relationship, and meaning.\n\n**Your Thesis:**  \n> \"**We need to reclaim our second eye**—the one that perceives meaning, beauty, and living connection—if we want to solve personal, social, and ecological crises.\"\n\n**Everything** in the book should serve that central point: **our worldview** leads to **patterns** of behavior that cause **insanity**. Changing the behavior without changing the worldview is like swapping the poison in your cup for a different flavor of poison—still poison.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Proposed Book Structure (12 Chapters)\n\nBelow is a suggested 12-chapter sequence—**each chapter starts with a question** that builds logically from the previous. Adapt as you see fit.\n\n### **Part I: Recognizing Our Madness**\n\n1. **Chapter 1:** \"**Why Does It Feel Like We’re Dying Inside While 'Succeeding'?**\"  \n   - **Story Hook:** Modern anxiety: climate dread, tasteless fruit, meaningless jobs, etc.  \n   - **Goal:** Show readers they’re not alone in feeling something’s off.  \n\n2. **Chapter 2:** \"**Is Our Worldview at Fault?**\"  \n   - **Story Hook:** E.g., your grandmother’s decline or a personal anecdote about seeing “insanity” up close.  \n   - **Goal:** Tease out how worldview → patterns. If we swap one tactic for another while the worldview stays the same, the result is still alienation.  \n\n3. **Chapter 3:** \"**Where Did This Toxic Worldview Even Come From?**\"  \n   - **Story Hook:** Pick a historical moment: Constantine merges church and state, or the Black Death’s rise of individualism, or Enlightenment’s worship of numbers.  \n   - **Goal:** Provide historical highlights that led to “one-eyed seeing.”\n\n### **Part II: How We Blind Ourselves Further**\n\n4. **Chapter 4:** \"**Why Do 'Good' Fixes Still Yield the Same Results?**\"  \n   - **Story Hook:** Microfinance fiasco, or a local NGO that ends up replicating harmful patterns.  \n   - **Goal:** Show that applying the same worldview to new solutions continues to produce the same alienation.  \n\n5. **Chapter 5:** \"**What Happens When We Only See Quantity, Not Quality?**\"  \n   - **Story Hook:** The decline of food nutrients, the mania for more control.  \n   - **Goal:** Illustrate that ignoring the second eye (quality) leads to deadening experiences—tasteless fruit, meaningless relationships, “fix the world with an app” illusions.  \n\n6. **Chapter 6:** \"**Why Are We So Obsessed with Control (and Does It Even Work)?**\"  \n   - **Story Hook:** Silicon Valley’s big promises or billionaires’ bunkers.  \n   - **Goal:** Critique the assumption that technology + data = real solutions; show that deeper relational/spiritual dimension is ignored.\n\n### **Part III: The Second Eye & Reclaiming Wholeness**\n\n7. **Chapter 7:** \"**What If We Have Another Way of Seeing (Our 'Second Eye')?**\"  \n   - **Story Hook:** The Father Greg Boyle moment, the Russian officer trusting intuition, or your personal “two eyes” epiphany.  \n   - **Goal:** Define “two eyes”: one for metrics, one for meaning.  \n\n8. **Chapter 8:** \"**How Does Reclaiming the Second Eye Change Our Lives?**\"  \n   - **Story Hook:** Personal transformation examples—someone who left the corporate treadmill or built a meaningful local enterprise.  \n   - **Goal:** Show how shifting worldview changes day-to-day decisions—like your “have-to vs. want-to” coaching framework.  \n\n9. **Chapter 9:** \"**Can This Shift Transform Our Work and Social Impact?**\"  \n   - **Story Hook:** The “gardening vs. factory” analogy, success at every step, relational NGO examples.  \n   - **Goal:** Illustrate new ways of measuring, new forms of business (Buurtzorg, etc.), and how that fosters real connection rather than exploitative metrics.\n\n### **Part IV: Living the New Paradigm**\n\n10. **Chapter 10:** \"**If We Change Our Worldview, What Kind of Economy Emerges?**\"  \n    - **Story Hook:** The difference between a local food forest (every moment is “success”) and a factory farm (always pushing for yield).  \n    - **Goal:** Envision an economy that’s about synergy with nature, relationships, and the sacred dimension of life.\n\n11. **Chapter 11:** \"**Aren’t We Too Late (Climate Collapse, Big Tech, etc.)?**\"  \n    - **Story Hook:** Real tension: despair about climate meltdown, unstoppable corporate power.  \n    - **Goal:** Address the big cynicism. Affirm that worldview shifts can happen quickly, citing historical changes in consciousness (e.g., sudden leaps in social norms).\n\n12. **Chapter 12:** \"**So...How Do We Start Seeing With Both Eyes?**\"  \n    - **Story Hook:** End with a combination of personal reflection practices + small group or organizational steps.  \n    - **Goal:** A practical blueprint for daily life—like journaling, real conversation, community activism, living with beauty and meaning at each step.\n\n**Conclusion:** Summarize the entire arc. Restate that everything feels wrong because we’re using the wrong lens. Once we open the second eye, we see a living, connected reality—and that changes everything.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Solve the “Worldview Leads to Patterns” Gap\n\n**Problem to Address:** People keep thinking “If we just do social capitalism instead of normal capitalism, we’ll fix it,” but they fail to realize they’re still adopting the same controlling, exploitative worldview, just re-labeled.\n\n**How to Solve It in the Book:**\n\n- **In Chapter 2 or 4**: Show that each new approach (social enterprise, philanthropic capitalism, “green tech”) tries to solve problems within the old worldview.  \n- **Use a Concrete Analogy**: The back-pain scenario—switching from social media job to coding job doesn’t fix the underlying posture or worldview about “sitting at a computer all day.”  \n- **Drive Home**: “Changing tactics within the same worldview = same results.” Repeatedly highlight that the real pivot is from “seeing nature, people, and self as resources” to “seeing them as living relationships.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. Guided Questions to Fill Important Gaps\n\n1. **What are your best personal stories that illustrate worldview shifts?**  \n   - Make a short list. Readers remember stories more than lectures.  \n   - Where have you seen someone persist with the same worldview, or discover the second eye in a surprising way?\n\n2. **Which historical turning points best illustrate how worldview changed?**  \n   - You mention Constantine, Black Death, Enlightenment, Industrial Revolution, Silicon Valley. **Pick the top 2–3 that pack the biggest punch** and keep the rest as brief references.\n\n3. **Where are your strongest real-world examples of “both eyes open” in practice?**  \n   - You talk about orchard analogies, nonprofits like Buurtzorg, or Father Boyle. Plan to highlight them thoroughly in the latter chapters.\n\n4. **How do you help readers see the difference between superficial “good solutions” and real worldview change?**  \n   - Identify a section (likely Chapter 4 or 5) to explicitly compare superficial fixes vs. deep shift. \n   - Be crystal clear: “Same logic, same results. Only a new lens produces new outcomes.”\n\n5. **How can you keep the book from feeling too negative or doomy?**  \n   - You need examples of success, real shifts, hopeful glimpses.  \n   - Offer steps, not to fix the entire planet, but to “awaken the second eye” in daily life.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Recommendations to Strengthen the Book\n\n- **Lean Hard on the Single Argument:** Don’t meander with tangents. Keep hitting the “wrong worldview → insane results → we need the second eye” message.\n- **Use Vivid Metaphors & Anecdotes Consistently:** E.g., back pain from two different desk jobs is still back pain. That’s a simple, direct metaphor people get.\n- **Sprinkle Real “Success Stories”** throughout the second half of the book to show it’s possible to live differently right now (even if the world still seems insane).\n- **End Each Chapter with a “Reflection or Practice”** that helps the reader apply the concept. Could be a journal prompt, a question to ask a friend, or a micro-challenge.\n- **Watch Out for Information Overload:** You love detail, but many readers just need the essential turning points in history. Keep it short, punchy, and connect it back to worldview change.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Kickstart Your Writing\n\n- **Pick the Chapter Questions** (and finalize them) so you have a clear guide.  \n- **Block out a writing schedule**: e.g., 2–3 days per chapter, generating a messy first draft.  \n- **Draft fast**, then refine. Don’t let perfectionism stall you. Your argument only refines once you see the big messy text on the page.\n\n---\n\n### Final Word\n\nYou’ve got **immense clarity** on what’s wrong and how worldview shapes everything. Now, just **structure** it as questions, consistently **hammer** that worldview shift is essential, and **offer** practical glimpses of a new way. That’s **your** zone of genius—helping people see with both eyes, so the “Good Life” and “saving the world” aren’t illusions but living realities.\n\n*No more dithering—go write.*",

      "content": "This idea—that changing tactics within the same worldview only produces the same results—has been echoed across many traditions, philosophies, and thinkers throughout history. Here are some **quotes, traditions, and cultural references** that support this argument:\n\n---\n\n### **Philosophy & Social Critique**\n1. **Albert Einstein** (1879–1955)  \n   > *“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”*  \n   - One of the most famous articulations of the idea that new solutions require a **paradigm shift**, not just adjustments within the existing frame.\n\n2. **Marshall McLuhan** (1911–1980)  \n   > *“The medium is the message.”*  \n   - The form of a system (capitalism, technology, governance) shapes outcomes more than any specific content within it. Just tweaking the content (e.g., making capitalism \"ethical\") doesn’t change the system’s fundamental logic.\n\n3. **David Graeber** (1961–2020)  \n   - His book *Bullshit Jobs* shows how modern capitalism creates meaningless work, and how attempts to reform it (e.g., making corporations more \"socially responsible\") still rely on the same logic of economic growth and control over people’s lives.\n\n4. **Thomas Kuhn** (*The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, 1962)  \n   - Kuhn’s concept of *paradigm shifts* shows that true change doesn’t happen incrementally within an old framework—it requires **replacing** that framework entirely.\n\n---\n\n### **Eastern Philosophy & Wisdom Traditions**\n5. **Lao Tzu** (*Tao Te Ching*, c. 6th Century BCE)  \n   > *“The more laws and restrictions there are, the poorer people become. The sharper men's weapons, the more trouble in the land. The more cunning and cleverness, the more falsehoods appear.”*  \n   - **Translation**: When we keep using the same mindset (control, laws, fixes), we recreate the same problems in new forms. Only stepping outside the control-based mentality opens new possibilities.\n\n6. **Buddhism & The Middle Way**  \n   - The Buddha saw that simply switching between indulgence and extreme asceticism wasn’t real liberation—it was just different expressions of attachment. Similarly, switching from extractive capitalism to “green capitalism” without changing the **underlying relationship** to consumption and domination is still attachment.\n\n7. **Zen Koan:**  \n   > *“Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.”*  \n   - **Translation**: The surface tasks might look the same, but when seen through a different awareness, they take on entirely new meaning. Changing external structures without shifting awareness doesn’t lead to transformation.\n\n---\n\n### **Indigenous Wisdom & Systems Thinking**\n8. **Robin Wall Kimmerer** (*Braiding Sweetgrass*, 2013)  \n   > *“Restoring land without restoring relationship is an empty exercise. It is relationship that will endure and sustain, not the mechanics of the world.”*  \n   - **Translation**: Just doing sustainable agriculture with the same **ownership & exploitation mindset** still results in extraction. We need **relational change**, not just better techniques.\n\n9. **Indigenous Australian \"Dreaming\" (Tjukurpa)**  \n   - Aboriginal cultures teach that land, people, and stories are interconnected. Colonizers tried to replace these relationships with private property and “resource management,” which just **replicated destruction in new forms** rather than restoring balance.\n\n---\n\n### **Christianity & Western Religious Thought**\n10. **Jesus Christ (Matthew 9:16-17)**  \n   > *“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.”*  \n   - **Translation**: You can’t just tweak the old system—it will break. Transformation requires a **whole new container**.\n\n11. **The Protestant Reformation (1517)**  \n   - Martin Luther’s problem with the Catholic Church wasn’t just about corruption—it was about a **fundamental shift** from a priest-mediated faith to direct connection with the divine. Replacing indulgences with different church taxes wouldn’t have changed anything; it was the **worldview shift** that mattered.\n\n---\n\n### **Political & Economic Thought**\n12. **Ivan Illich** (*Tools for Conviviality*, 1973)  \n   > *“People will be caught in a trap unless they reject the dominant mode of production, not just its products.”*  \n   - Simply reforming schools, hospitals, and workplaces **within the same mechanized logic** won’t free people. The system itself needs to be rethought.\n\n13. **The French Revolution (1789)**  \n   - The revolution overthrew the monarchy but **replaced it with another centralized system** (Napoleon, bureaucratic nationalism). Without changing the **worldview of power and hierarchy**, France just got a new form of domination.\n\n14. **James C. Scott** (*Seeing Like a State*, 1998)  \n   - Scott shows how top-down planning (even well-intentioned) **fails because it applies mechanical thinking to living systems**. Big governments and corporations often replicate colonialist mindsets even in their social programs.\n\n---\n\n### **Scientific & Systems Thinking**\n15. **Gregory Bateson** (*Steps to an Ecology of Mind*, 1972)  \n   > *“The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and the way people think.”*  \n   - **Translation**: If we don’t **change how we think**, all solutions will simply be new manifestations of old problems.\n\n16. **Donella Meadows** (*Thinking in Systems*, 2008)  \n   - \"You can’t ‘solve’ a system’s problem with the same thinking that created it. You have to shift the paradigm.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **Metaphors to Drive It Home**\n- **The Back Pain Analogy (Work vs. Worldview):**  \n  Switching from **social media marketing** to **coding** doesn’t solve the **posture problem**—it just relocates the issue. Similarly, switching from **capitalist business** to **“ethical capitalism”** keeps the **underlying logic of control and extraction** intact.\n\n- **The Diet Analogy:**  \n  If you have a junk-food diet, switching from **McDonald's to “organic McDonald's”** doesn’t solve the issue. The **relationship to food** is what must change.\n\n- **The Broken Compass Analogy:**  \n  If your **compass is broken**, switching from **a speedboat to a sailboat** won’t stop you from heading in the wrong direction. You need a **new way of navigating**, not just a new vessel.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Integrate These Into the Book**\n- **Use a mix of philosophy, history, and real-world examples** to **reinforce the idea that worldview change is the real pivot point.**  \n- **Bring in a punchy metaphor early on** (e.g., the back pain or diet analogy) so readers get it **intuitively** before diving into heavier material.  \n- **End a chapter with a \"Test Your Own Worldview\" Reflection:**  \n  - “Where in your own life have you tried switching tactics instead of changing the underlying approach?”\n  - “What problems keep recurring no matter how much effort you put in? Could it be because the deeper framework hasn’t changed?”  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary**\n- **The key takeaway** is that **tactics** (like “social capitalism” or “green energy”) within the **same worldview** (control, extraction, domination) still produce **the same distortions**.  \n- **True transformation** happens when we stop tweaking the **same broken model** and instead **shift to a new paradigm of relationship, recognition, and interconnection**.\n\n---\n\n#### *Want me to refine specific parts or expand any of these ideas?*",

The metaphor is powerful, but it needs to be unpacked so readers can grasp its significance.\\n   - There might be a challenge in bridging the gap between abstract ideas (worldview, recognition) and tangible actions. Providing concrete examples and steps to reclaim this second eye will be crucial.\\n\\n2. **Balancing Personal Narrative and Analysis:**\\n   - If the book leans too heavily on personal anecdotes, it might lose some readers looking for more analytical depth. Conversely, too much historical analysis might make it feel dry. Finding the right mix is key.\\n\\n3. **Addressing Potential Skepticism:**\\n   - Some readers might be skeptical about the idea of a \"second eye\" or the need to shift worldviews. Anticipating these objections and addressing them head-on could strengthen your argument.\\n\\n4. **Practical Applications:**\\n   - The book needs to provide clear, actionable steps for readers to reclaim their second eye in their daily lives. Vague or abstract suggestions might leave readers feeling lost. \\n\\n5. **Balancing Hope and Realism:**\\n   - It\\'s important to balance the critique of current systems with a hopeful vision for the future. The book should inspire readers but also acknowledge the challenges in shifting worldviews.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Recommendations for Strengthening the Book**\\n- **Clarify the Metaphor:** Develop the concept of the \"second eye\" in a way that\\'s accessible and relatable. Use examples and metaphors to illustrate the idea.\\n- **Ground Abstract Ideas:** Use concrete examples and case studies to make abstract concepts more tangible.\\n- **Address Skepticism:** Anticipate and address potential objections or criticisms to strengthen your argument.\\n- **Provide Practical Steps:** Offer clear, actionable steps for readers to apply the book\\'s insights in their own lives.\\n- **Balance Critique with Hope:', 'direction': 'out', 'decoding_id': 0}\n{'expiry_datetime': '2025-03-05T16:26:49.589385+00:00', 'content_type': 'audio_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'sediment://file_aebfbe0b7b68300213dfc7eab6616542c753012b9aa7bfa60cb8b7f32a6bb1c427d63a0a52aab272d47753ccba02f6d9', 'size_bytes': 7908078, 'format': 'wav', 'metadata': {'start_timestamp': None, 'end_timestamp': None, 'pretokenized_vq': None, 'interruptions': None, 'original_audio_source': None, 'transcription': None, 'word_transcription': None, 'start': 0, 'end': 164.75}}",

This example can illustrate how simply changing the economic model (e.g., to social capitalism) without addressing the worldview can replicate old patterns of exploitation.\\n   - **The Green Revolution:** This movement aimed to solve hunger through industrial agriculture methods, but it often disregarded local ecosystems and traditional farming knowledge, leading to issues like soil depletion and loss of biodiversity. This can highlight how solutions that focus on metrics (like crop yields) without a relational understanding can perpetuate problems.\\n\\n### 2. **Contemporary Examples**\\n   - **Microfinance in Developing Countries:** Initially intended to empower the poor, microfinance has sometimes devolved into exploitative practices, trapping borrowers in cycles of debt. This demonstrates how applying financial tools within the same profit-driven framework can reproduce exploitation.\\n   - **Sustainable Fashion:** Brands promoting \"sustainable\" or \"ethical\" fashion might still rely on exploitative labor practices or fast fashion models. The underlying economic incentives remain unchanged.\\n\\n### 3. **Cultural & Philosophical Examples**\\n   - **Buurtzorg Model in Healthcare:** This Dutch home-care organization replaced traditional top-down management with self-managed teams, demonstrating how a relational approach can lead to better outcomes. It’s an example of fundamentally changing the operational worldview.\\n   - **The Amish Community:** Their deliberate rejection of certain modern technologies is based on maintaining community cohesion and values, showing a different worldview in practice.\\n\\n### 4. **Personal Narratives**\\n   - **Your Own Journey:** Your shift from viewing social impact through metrics to focusing on relational connection can serve as a relatable example of changing worldviews.\\n   - **Anecdotes from Father Greg Boyle’s Work:** Stories from Homeboy Industries that showcase how focusing on friendship and community rather than metrics has led to transformative outcomes.\\n\\n### 5. **Analogies & Metaphors**\\n   - **Garden vs. Factory:** Comparing a factory’s focus on uniform outputs to a garden’s nurturing of diverse, thriving ecosystems can vividly illustrate', 'direction': 'out', 'decoding_id': None}\n{'expiry_datetime': '2025-03-05T16:29:39.865331+00:00', 'content_type': 'audio_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'sediment://file_fbc305825e68300236a98eb00915893bc753012b9aa7bfa60cb8b7f32a6bb1c427d63a0a52aab272d47753ccba02f6d9', 'size_bytes': 5976078, 'format': 'wav', 'metadata': {'start_timestamp': None, 'end_timestamp': None, 'pretokenized_vq': None, 'interruptions': None, 'original_audio_source': None, 'transcription': None, 'word_transcription': None, 'start': 0, 'end': 124.5}}",

Like, when a different schema was realized, then suddenly different things were able to happen. I have a bad metaphor and I need your help fixing it, but basically, like, you know a dog is in a lawn with an electric fence, and it believes that if it goes over there, it'll get shocked, so that even when the electric fence is turned off, the dog won't go to certain areas. And so this idea of, like, our beliefs shaping the spaces of possibility, and then once the beliefs are changed, the spaces of possibility change, like this idea that we talk about systems thinking, and we're trying to look at a system with our current mindset, which is really small, right? It's like a little, like a telescope pointed, or a microscope pointed at, like, an organic body of wholeness, and we need the thing that can see wholeness, and we only have one eye in our body that is able to take in wholeness, and it's captivating, and it gives us these moments of speechlessness, because we're not able to speak when we're in the presence of the holy. And so, and then when we get back, we realize what of that holy is for me, right? What of that holy experience is important for me to attend to? What is the sign from God to me in all of that? I would like to try to talk about that, and find different ways of accessing this metaphoric idea of, like, oh, shoot, so that's what that is. That's why all of these systems can't account for the wholeness, because we're trying to do systems thinking with one eye shut, and then we can do, like, systems matching, where we do systems thinking, and we look at the individual pieces, but we need people that also can sense into the wholeness, and kind of confirm or deny, you know, something like that, right? Where those pieces fit, and how we should be interacting with the wholeness. And so it's keeping this eye that it has to all come and fit together in this kind of beautiful, seamless, perfect way, and if it doesn't, when we're trying to do any of our little repairs or micro-improvements, then it's the wrong thing, you know? Something like that. Does that make sense? And then how can I come up with some better metaphors than a dog in a yard with an electric fence, and how can I talk about this in a different way as well, so that I can make this analogy clear, and are there great historic examples that kind of showcase this phenomenon?

The individualism, the industrial revolution, all these examples are kind of examples of how these paradigm shifts contracted our perspective. And I'm wondering if we have examples of when they did the opposite. And I'm wondering also if you could talk about what precipitated the paradigm shift and what it takes for it to gain mass adoption. Is it a massive experience that a population faces? For instance, one of the ideas that I review are the impacts of the way that the Black Plague had on people's thinking. And I think it's more like a map than a lens or something like that, because the idea is that it shows you more or less. But the idea of a map that, more like Google Maps, because it's trying to optimize something for you that you're not sure exactly what it's trying to optimize, you wind up taking routes that will imply that you don't get lost, you don't pass by things that you don't intend to pass by. And maps, as more and more people wind up using it, it really just buys popular neighborhoods. Because if it determines that this person had the best and shortest time that they were walking, then this should be the route that people take instead of Batsby, which actually is more beautiful. It has better architecture, and so on. And then because Google Maps kind of sets this, and because people don't actually develop any more a way of navigating without Google Maps, we're kind of locked into this Google Maps way of seeing the world. And it's sort of more like that, but I don't like using Google Maps as an analogy. Is there something else that I can use that has some of these factors inside of it? Like, what are the principles that kind of make this analogy meaningful? It's like, there's some kind of elements of doing things in a certain way, limiting you from doing things in another way, limiting serendipity and openness, trying to optimize for things, and getting a certain worldview, and then that worldview getting kind of locked in, because it becomes easier to do. So it's like, you know, you want to cook dinner, you're going to do one of the things inside of your mental repertoire, rather than try to imagine outside of it. I don't know, there's something about being boxed in by instructions, by a map. And yeah, it is sort of like a map of the world. What other analogies are there here? And yeah, can you unpack that a little bit, and also find examples that are historic, that are about, you know, maybe letting go of that map, and maybe undoing those principles. So probably one of the first things we should do is come up with a principle first, and then look for paradigm shifts that offer that more expanded view.\", 'direction': 'in', 'decoding_id': None}\n{'expiry_datetime': '2025-03-05T16:54:07.110322+00:00', 'content_type': 'real_time_user_audio_video_asset_pointer', 'frames_asset_pointers': [], 'video_container_asset_pointer': None, 'audio_asset_pointer': {'expiry_datetime': '2025-03-05T16:54:07.110322+00:00', 'content_type': 'audio_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'sediment://file_5fc043839ab0300227214291dbb6fcf8c753012b9aa7bfa60cb8b7f32a6bb1c427d63a0a52aab272d47753ccba02f6d9', 'size_bytes': 9618798, 'format': 'wav', 'metadata': {'start_timestamp': None, 'end_timestamp': None, 'pretokenized_vq': None, 'interruptions': None, 'original_audio_source': None, 'transcription': None, 'word_transcription': None, 'start': 0, 'end': 200.39}}, 'audio_start_timestamp': 641.6476135030389}",

And I think part of it is because I think that we have a part of us that has access to an already expanded worldview. And I think that's, you know, you talk about the Civil Rights Movement, and yeah, the Civil Rights Movement did have that kind of property. But I'd say that it had that partially because it had a religious connection and that religions are the thing that offer this possibility for acknowledging that there's, like, such thing as wisdom, you know? Such thing as wisdom and an expanded worldview that opens up these new possibilities of being and belonging in a way that's meaningful and that we prefer. But when you first started giving me all of these different ways that things, you know, the Industrial Revolution and all that, I'd say that it's not necessarily related to that. And actually there's a lot of historians that would argue that it's actually something about the kind of European mindset and worldview that is kind of weird in history. Because there were people that also had all of those, you know, wealth and the scientific and technological capacities. But they didn't wind up, you know, colonizing the world. Like, there's that General Qi from China who traveled around the world with, like, thousands and thousands of vessels. And he could have very easily colonized and taken over and exploited people. But that wasn't what he did. He was just adventuring and learning about the world. And I think that is because of the mindset that is different between what he had and what the Europeans have had. And I think it's kind of interesting to think about it from that direction. That it's not really, like, two opposing mindsets or many different mindsets that, you know, we have these, like, progression of ideas. It's more like you have a kind of way of looking that is connected to the things that you find meaningful and beautiful. And what you're looking at is the things that make us feel like we're powerful and we can talk about it. And I kind of wonder what, you know, who in the world are the people we're trying to figure out who are the things that we can study, we can think, might say about this. And I also think that it might be that if we look at the, you know, crafts and the mystical traditions of Master's students, that accessing this worldview is about a process and a practice. Like, every religious and spiritual tradition has things to do to teach us, to learn from it, ways to go about things, to come to the realization that that is what we want. And so I think that the practice element is also super critical. And so it could be interesting to think about what is a worldview when it has a business plan and a practice connected to it.",

      "content": "I think you're hitting on something really important: the realization that what we’re dealing with isn’t just a sequence of historical shifts but a fundamental *way of seeing*—one that is rooted in power, control, and domination versus one that is rooted in relationality, recognition, and reverence.\n\nSo let’s clarify:  \n\n1. **This isn’t just “two opposing worldviews.”** It’s about a way of looking at the world that prioritizes extraction, control, and instrumentalization versus one that sees life as interconnected, relational, and meaningful. Some cultures and historical figures had power but chose not to dominate. That means the issue isn’t just “power corrupts” but “worldview shapes how we use power.”  \n\n2. **The Western European worldview is weird in history.** This tracks. Other powerful civilizations had the means to dominate but didn’t. Zheng He’s fleet could have conquered and exploited. It didn’t. The Islamic Golden Age had vast knowledge and trade networks but didn’t center extractive conquest the way European colonialism did. The difference? *A way of seeing.*  \n\n3. **Wisdom traditions (mysticism, crafts, spiritual practices) offer a pathway back.** You’re suggesting that we *already have* the ability to access a different way of seeing, but it’s been buried. And this is where practice comes in—not as an abstract theory, but as an *embodied process of perception.* Every mystical tradition, from Sufism to Zen, from Hesychasm to Taoism, has methods for *seeing differently*. The key is not *thinking* our way into a new worldview but *practicing* our way into it.  \n\n4. **What happens when a worldview has a business plan?** This is fascinating. We’re not just talking about ideas—we’re talking about ways of living and organizing society. If the dominant worldview sees resources, time, and people as things to extract value from, then any “business plan” within that system—even if it’s “social impact”—will reproduce those dynamics.  \n   - What would a business plan look like if it were built *not* on extraction but on relationship?  \n   - What would an economy look like if it were based on *mutual recognition* rather than competition and optimization?  \n   - What happens when an organization *practices* a different way of seeing, instead of just talking about it?  \n\n### Strengthening Your Book's Argument  \n\nTo make this land powerfully, I’d suggest adding **three key moves** to your book:  \n\n#### 1. **The Weirdness of the Western European Worldview (AHA Moments)**  \n- This isn’t “just how things are.” It’s a particular way of seeing that is historically unusual.  \n- Zheng He vs. Columbus: Two powerful figures, two different relationships to power.  \n- The Scientific Revolution wasn’t just about learning—it was about *controlling* and *quantifying* reality.  \n- The Protestant Reformation created a deep suspicion of anything unquantifiable (mysticism, relational wisdom, embodied knowing).  \n\n#### 2. **Wisdom Traditions & Practices as the Missing Key**  \n- Every spiritual tradition has *practices* for shifting perception—ritual, silence, craft, contemplation.  \n- This isn’t just about rejecting capitalism. It’s about *how we train our perception to see beyond it.*  \n- The reason we keep “repeating capitalism with a new name” is because we’re still *seeing the world the same way.*  \n- What happens when an organization *trains* its perception differently? (E.g., Buddhist economics, Sufi craft traditions, Indigenous governance models).  \n\n#### 3. **How Practice Embodies a Different Worldview**  \n- If you only analyze a worldview intellectually, you’re still in the same mental frame.  \n- *Craftsmanship* teaches slowness, presence, and attunement to material reality.  \n- *Contemplative traditions* train direct perception of beauty, meaning, and interconnection.  \n- *Agricultural traditions* (permaculture, Indigenous land practices) show *how* to structure an economy around care rather than extraction.  \n\n---\n\n### How This Strengthens the Book  \n\nYou already have a powerful structure, but these additions will:  \n- **Make it undeniable** that we’re dealing with a specific, historically weird worldview.  \n- **Show why past solutions (social enterprise, green capitalism) keep failing.**  \n- **Offer a way forward that isn’t just critique—it’s practice.**  \n\n---\n\n### Who Would Love This Book?  \n\nThis could resonate deeply with:  \n- **Philosophically-inclined business leaders & social entrepreneurs** (they sense something is off but don’t have the language for it).  \n- **People disillusioned with traditional capitalism/social impact models.**  \n- **Mystics, craftspeople, and artists who intuitively *get* this but lack a framework to articulate it.**  \n- **Activists looking for a more rooted, long-term way of seeing change.**  \n\n---\n\n### Next Steps  \n\n1. **Would you like a revised chapter outline incorporating these elements?**  \n2. **Do you want a list of specific mystical traditions, practices, and historical counter-examples to explore further?**  \n3. **Are there any specific case studies or real-world examples you’d like me to suggest?**  \n\nThis book is already alive in you. Let’s make it hit with the clarity and force it deserves.",

      "content": "You’re circling around a profound insight: **Western modernity systematically devalues entanglement, embodied practice, and relational knowing in favor of abstraction, ownership, and control.** The Protestant movement, capitalism, and even modern finance share a deep suspicion of anything that can’t be locked down, owned, or perpetually accumulated. \n\nLet’s break this down into key historical and conceptual threads you could explore in your book.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Suspicion of the Hand: The \"Anti-Practice\" Movement**\nThere’s a long, deep bias against manual labor, craft, and embodied knowing in Western thought. You’re noticing how this connects to:\n- Protestantism’s rejection of ritual (no intermediaries, no sacraments, just the Word).\n- Capitalism’s preference for ownership over work (business owner > business doer).\n- The financialization of everything (passive income > active labor).\n\n**But why?**\n- **Greek Roots:** Plato vs. Aristotle—Plato’s “forms” vs. Aristotle’s practical knowledge (*phronesis*). Plato deeply distrusted the physical world and saw the intellect as the only real form of knowing. This bias gets carried forward through Western philosophy.  \n- **Christian Theology:** Medieval Catholicism actually had space for embodied practice (monastic craft, sacred labor). Protestantism stripped this away, turning religion into something purely intellectual and abstract.  \n- **Capitalist Logic:** The Industrial Revolution didn’t just mechanize work—it devalued the worker. The real power is ownership, capital, control of *other people’s* labor.  \n\n**Contrast this with other traditions:**  \n- Islam and Judaism both retain strong traditions of valuing craftsmanship (Sufi woodworkers, Jewish scribes).  \n- Zen Buddhism deeply integrates contemplative practice with craft (tea ceremony, calligraphy, gardening).  \n- Indigenous traditions worldwide see labor as a way of being in right relationship (potlatch economies, weaving, farming as ritual).  \n\nYour book could highlight that **Western capitalism and Protestantism uniquely disconnect labor from meaning**, while many other traditions integrate them.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Time, Ownership, and the Fragility of Expectations**\nYou nailed this: **modern finance is based on locking down time itself.**\n- Interest allows you to **own future value.**  \n- Contracts turn relational obligations into legally enforceable debts.  \n- Passive income makes it possible to extract from the future indefinitely.  \n\nContrast this with **gift economies and entangled relationships:**\n- Gifts are about **obligation, not possession.** They demand ongoing relationship.  \n- Practices like farming and craft work in **seasons, cycles, and relationships, not fixed, predictable returns.**  \n- In many Indigenous and peasant societies, wealth wasn’t about accumulation but about circulation—moving resources to sustain relationships over time.  \n\n**Why is the financial worldview fragile?**  \n- Expectations create fragility. If you assume linear growth, any disruption feels catastrophic.  \n- Gift-based economies, in contrast, **build resilience through relationships.**  \n\nA killer metaphor: The difference between a **financial empire (brittle, must always grow, fragile to collapse)** vs. a **forest (resilient, adaptive, always changing).**  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Were Peasants Actually Poor?**\nModern people imagine peasants as miserable, starving, and irrelevant to modernity. But let’s actually look at what their lives were like:\n- **Medieval peasants worked far fewer hours** than modern workers (pre-Enclosure, they had festivals, communal land, and subsistence autonomy).  \n- Many had **deep local knowledge of agriculture, ecology, and craft**—skills we now consider highly valuable (permaculture, fermentation, herbal medicine).  \n- The **Enclosure movement forced peasants into waged labor**, creating dependence on markets and money rather than community-based reciprocity.  \n\n**What were peasant revolutions about?**\n- **The Diggers and the Levellers (1600s England):** Opposed the privatization of common land.  \n- **The German Peasants’ War (1525):** Protested feudal exploitation, inspired by radical Protestantism.  \n- **The Zapatistas (modern Mexico):** Indigenous peasants fighting against neoliberal land privatization.  \n\n**Should we live like peasants?**  \nNot necessarily—but we should **reclaim what they knew that we’ve lost**:\n- Local food systems  \n- Communal land use  \n- Work as craft, not just labor  \n- Slower, cyclical time rather than linear, extractive time  \n\n---\n\n### **4. The Relationship Between Contemplative Traditions & Craft/Farming**\nYou asked if there’s a historical connection between **contemplative traditions and craft/agriculture.** The answer is *absolutely* yes.  \n- **Buddhist monastic traditions:** Zen monks farmed, wove, and built as part of their spiritual practice.  \n- **Christian monasteries:** Preserved knowledge through scribing, brewing, and agriculture.  \n- **Sufism:** Many orders were deeply tied to craft traditions—woodworking, weaving, calligraphy, gardening.  \n- **Indigenous traditions:** Farming, foraging, and weaving are often spiritual acts, requiring attunement to the land and seasons.  \n\nThe key takeaway: **To engage in real craft is to train perception.**  \n- A farmer learns to *read* the land, weather, and soil.  \n- A weaver learns to *see* patterns and tension in the threads.  \n- A carpenter learns to *listen* to the grain of the wood.  \n\nThis is **a different way of knowing**—one that capitalist modernity devalues because it’s non-extractive, non-scalable, and deeply tied to place and relationship.\n\n---\n\n### **How This Strengthens Your Book**\nThis gives you **stronger historical evidence** for your argument:\n- The Western devaluation of practice isn’t “just capitalism”—it’s an older, deeper worldview shift.\n- Finance and capitalism aren’t just about money—they are **attempts to control time and relationship.**\n- Peasants weren’t just *poor*—they lived in a fundamentally different reality, one we might need to recover.\n- Craft, agriculture, and contemplative practice **train perception in ways that abstraction never can.**\n\n---\n\n### **Where This Could Go in Your Book**\nHere’s how I see this strengthening your structure:  \n\n#### **Chapter 1: Why Do We Feel So Disconnected?**  \n- Start with the modern feeling of disconnection, alienation, and burnout.  \n- Set up the idea that **it’s not just capitalism—it’s a worldview problem.**  \n\n#### **Chapter 2: The \"Weird\" Western View of the World**  \n- Zheng He vs. Columbus: Two ways to use power.  \n- The Protestant break from ritual, craft, and embodied knowing.  \n- Finance as an attempt to control time and relationship.  \n\n#### **Chapter 3: The Great Flattening—Why We Lost Craft, Relationship, and Perception**  \n- Industrialization: Making everything a commodity.  \n- The shift from craft to waged labor.  \n- The war on embodied, non-quantifiable knowledge.  \n\n#### **Chapter 4: The Myth of the Starving Peasant—What We Actually Lost**  \n- Peasant revolutions: What they really fought for.  \n- Commons-based living vs. market dependency.  \n- Skills and knowledge we now see as “alternative” but used to be normal.  \n\n#### **Chapter 5: The Suspicion of the Hand—Why We Fear Embodied Knowledge**  \n- Plato, Protestantism, and the disembodiment of knowledge.  \n- Craft, farming, and contemplation as forms of wisdom.  \n- Why work that leaves no *quantifiable output* feels “less valuable.”  \n\n#### **Chapter 6: What We Can Recover—The Path Forward**  \n- Practices that re-train perception.  \n- Learning to see interconnection again.  \n- Moving from ownership-based security to relationship-based resilience.  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Do any of these ideas feel like they clarify your book’s direction?**  \n2. **Do you want deeper research into any of these areas?** I can pull more sources, case studies, or traditions.  \n3. **What’s the core experience you want your reader to walk away with?** We can refine the argument even further to make it hit harder.  \n\nYou’re onto something *big*. You’re tracing a core fracture in modernity that most people only *sense* but can’t name clearly. Let’s sharpen it.",

      "content": "What are all of the things that slowly transformed the ideas? It seems like the Catholic Church was both an antagonist and a protagonist in our story. A protagonist in that it preserved some of the relational and embodied elements and an antagonist because it brought this hierarchy and mistrust of the self. And it's very interesting that it can be both of these things. It feels like this is the problem. Things swing one way and then the other. And I'm wondering, like, it's so interesting all of the things that we can say we are learning, right? So interest from banks we learned that we can disconnect making wealth and money from the the land and labor and inaction. We just own things and you can make money. And it kind of is sort of the ultimate disconnect of the purity, right? Interest is the ultimate purity. It's like, don't get your body involved at all, you know? Your lineage is blessed. It is the new Sun King, right? It's the new royalty because it is inherited as well, right? And so it's sort of interesting that this is the kind of society that we treat of as royalty as well. It's like, wow, you don't have to use your body to make money. You don't have to enact in the world to be worthy. You are inherently worthy because someone in your family made it into the interest-based banking system however they did, right? And sometimes it's literally because of the aristocracy in their background and wealth that was essentially enclosed from the peasants and then, you know, compounded upon. And sometimes it's not. But I think that's very interesting. And so can we make a table of all the things that we learned from all of these things that we are seeing and how they impacted this quality of towards or away, this quality of engaged or disconnected, relational or not, seeing with the eye of reason, and seeing with the eye of quality, or seeing without the eye of quality. Like, what are all the different variables we're exploring? And what happened throughout history for us to learn one thing or another, just like the whole thing about interest? I think that's kind of a good way of looking at things.\nI guess another way at looking at capitalism is that it’s sort of like a factory farm - where the variables are reduced (relationally craft processes) and industrialized so that efficiencies and expectations can be made of the system - easier handles for our limited minds (how does that evolve through the 2nd 3rd and 4th Industrial Revolution s?)\n\nHas anyone made the argument that Protestantism and western capitalism newly disconnect labor from meaning? \n\nAvoiding obligation and wanting ownership seems childish. Why did this happen? Seems like a simple clear thing to explore too \n\n3d printing is another “factory farm” where we homogenize wood and make wood pulp with properties we can understand so we can use a machine to extrude it vs a woodworker knowing the grain of the wood and working with it\n\nThe peasant revolution makes me feel like this worldview may have won the battle and not the war. It can’t because it goes against the grain of “first principles” the principles from which nature emerged from and to which so many of these “indigenous / peasant” based ideas attach - can we see a list of how much of these ideas and \n\nphilosophies are “natural” and how the way capitalism and Protestantisms methods of controlling time and relationship go against it- it’s not really just capitalism and Protestantism is it? What’s the broader picture? Individualism and then fear to protect this small organism vs the beauty of being entangled in time (ancestors  linagae wisdom tradition) and space and that there’s something strange happening that makes people want to be free (like America is the land of the free) and that this country innovates a lot yet does it without doing it in a container. The idea that disruptive innovation is a good thing is insane - we don’t need to have manufactured needs or planned obsolescence ",

      "content": "This table provides a structured way to explore how various historical events and ideological shifts impacted relationality, embodiment, and worldview. You can use it to trace how certain changes—such as the rise of interest-based banking or the Protestant work ethic—contributed to the disconnection from lived, relational engagement and moved societies toward abstraction, control, and efficiency.\n\nNow, based on this framework, here are a few key ways to strengthen your book:\n\n### **Guided Questions to Fill Important Gaps:**\n1. **Where does the resistance to relationality come from?**\n   - Is it purely about efficiency, or is there something deeper (fear of dependence, fear of mortality)?\n   - What are historical moments when people fought for relationality and embodiment (e.g., peasant revolts, cooperative movements)?\n\n2. **What about alternative traditions that never fully bought into this shift?**\n   - Compare Protestant capitalism vs. Orthodox economies vs. Islamic banking vs. Indigenous gift economies.\n   - What do we learn from societies that resisted quantification?\n\n3. **What role did technology play as an enabler of disconnection?**\n   - How did industrialization, digitalization, and AI accelerate the abstraction of labor and relationships?\n   - Is technology inherently alienating, or can it be reclaimed?\n\n4. **Why did Protestantism and capitalism go hand in hand?**\n   - Weber’s “Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism” argued that the belief in predestination and moral purity encouraged relentless work and accumulation.\n   - Can we challenge that assumption? Are there counter-examples?\n\n5. **How do we see a similar move happening now in AI and automation?**\n   - If industrialization disconnected us from land and craft, is AI disconnecting us from thinking and intuition?\n   - How do we keep wisdom alive when so much is automated?\n\n6. **What are the real consequences of devaluing “the work of the hands”?**\n   - How has the loss of craft and farming traditions changed our mental well-being?\n   - Why do people yearn for “authentic” work, and why does the modern economy resist it?\n\n7. **What’s the difference between wealth in a gift economy vs. wealth in capitalism?**\n   - In capitalism, wealth is hoarded and compounded.\n   - In relational societies, wealth is *given* to build bonds (e.g., Potlatch ceremonies, Zakat in Islam).\n   - What does it mean to shift our sense of value?\n\n8. **If capitalism is a factory farm, what’s the alternative?**\n   - What are economic models that preserve relationships?\n   - What role does trust play in economies of relationality?\n\n9. **How do you teach people to *see* again?**\n   - How do you move someone from only trusting metrics to recognizing quality?\n   - What practices help develop this “second eye” for meaning?\n\n10. **What does an embodied, relational economy look like?**\n   - What do businesses, communities, and even governance structures look like when they prioritize *relational intelligence* over pure efficiency?\n   - Can we measure success differently?\n\n### **Practical Next Steps**\n- Use the table as a roadmap for key chapters or as a way to organize case studies.\n- Develop a “practice” chapter where you explore how people *re-learn* relational ways of seeing.\n- Strengthen the AI and automation critique—link it explicitly to historical patterns.\n- Make the Protestant-Capitalism connection clearer by highlighting key theological shifts.\n- Show real-world counterexamples of economies that have resisted this logic (gift economies, cooperative movements).\n\nWould you like me to refine the table further, break it into more digestible sections, or align it more clearly with a book outline?",

The Roman Republic's influence is evident in the political frameworks of many contemporary nations.\n\n2. **Cultural and Legal Foundations:**\n   - Roman law has significantly shaped modern legal systems, introducing concepts such as codified statutes and legal rights. Additionally, Western culture has inherited artistic, architectural, and philosophical elements from Rome.\n\n3. **Military and Economic Influence:**\n   - Rome exerted vast military and economic power across its territories. Similarly, today's leading nations project their influence globally through military presence and economic policies, reminiscent of Roman imperial reach.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n1. **Technological Advancements:**\n   - Modern society operates within an industrial and digital framework, vastly different from Rome's agrarian-based economy. The technological revolution has transformed communication, transportation, and daily life in ways unimaginable in ancient times.\n\n2. **Social and Ethical Norms:**\n   - Contemporary views on human rights, equality, and individual freedoms have evolved significantly since Roman times.

      "content": "Certainly, let's delve into the questions posed earlier to deepen our understanding of the interplay between Protestantism, capitalism, and the evolving perceptions of labor and meaning.\n\n**1. Has anyone made the argument that Protestantism and Western capitalism newly disconnect labor from meaning?**\n\nYes, scholars have explored how Protestantism, particularly certain Calvinist doctrines, influenced the development of capitalism and altered perceptions of labor. Max Weber, in his seminal work *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*, argued that the Protestant work ethic emphasized diligence, discipline, and frugality, which fostered a spirit conducive to capitalist enterprise. This perspective suggests a shift where labor became a means to demonstrate individual piety and success, potentially leading to a more utilitarian view of work. citeturn0search18\n\n**2. Avoiding obligation and wanting ownership seems childish. Why did this happen? Seems like a simple clear thing to explore too.**\n\nThe desire to avoid obligation and prioritize ownership can be traced to several historical and cultural developments:\n\n- **Individualism:** The Enlightenment era emphasized individual rights and autonomy, leading to a cultural shift where personal freedom became paramount. This fostered a preference for ownership, as it symbolizes control and independence.\n\n- **Economic Structures:** Capitalism promotes private property and ownership as fundamental principles. The accumulation of personal wealth and assets became indicators of success and security, reinforcing the desire for ownership.\n\n- **Social Mobility:** Ownership, particularly of property, has historically been linked to social status and power. The pursuit of ownership can thus be seen as a means to achieve upward mobility and societal recognition.\n\nThese factors contributed to a cultural inclination towards ownership and a distancing from communal obligations.\n\n**3. 3D printing is another “factory farm” where we homogenize wood and make wood pulp with properties we can understand so we can use a machine to extrude it vs a woodworker knowing the grain of the wood and working with it.**\n\nThis observation highlights the tension between traditional craftsmanship and modern manufacturing:\n\n- **Homogenization vs. Individualization:** Modern manufacturing, including 3D printing, often involves standardizing materials to ensure consistency and efficiency. This contrasts with traditional craftsmanship, where artisans engage intimately with unique materials, adapting their techniques to the specific characteristics of each piece.\n\n- **Detachment from Materiality:** Advanced manufacturing can lead to a detachment from the inherent qualities of materials. In traditional woodworking, understanding the grain and natural properties of wood is crucial, fostering a deep connection between the craftsman and the material.\n\n- **Efficiency vs. Mastery:** While modern methods prioritize speed and replicability, traditional craftsmanship values the mastery of skills and the nuanced understanding of materials, leading to unique, individualized creations.\n\nThis shift reflects broader themes of disconnection from embodied practices and relational engagement with materials in favor of efficiency and control.\n\n**4. The peasant revolution makes me feel like this worldview may have won the battle and not the war. It can’t because it goes against the grain of “first principles” the principles from which nature emerged from and to which so many of these “indigenous / peasant” based ideas attach - can we see a list of how much of these ideas and philosophies are “natural” and how the way capitalism and Protestantism's methods of controlling time and relationship go against it? It’s not really just capitalism and Protestantism, is it? What’s the broader picture?**\n\nThe tension between industrialized, capitalist societies and traditional, indigenous, or peasant ways of life reflects deeper philosophical divergences:\n\n- **Holistic vs. Mechanistic Worldviews:** Many indigenous and peasant cultures operate within a holistic framework, viewing humans as interconnected with nature and community. In contrast, capitalist and industrial paradigms often adopt a mechanistic view, treating nature and labor as resources to be managed and exploited.\n\n- **Cyclical vs. Linear Time:** Traditional societies frequently perceive time as cyclical, aligned with natural rhythms and seasons. Capitalist societies, influenced by Protestant ethics, often view time linearly, emphasizing progress, schedules, and deadlines.\n\n- **Relational vs. Transactional Relationships:** Indigenous philosophies typically value relationships and community cohesion, whereas capitalist frameworks prioritize transactions, contracts, and individual gain.\n\nThese contrasts illustrate a broader cultural shift towards abstraction, control, and individualism, often at odds with more relational and embodied ways of being.\n\n**5. Individualism and then fear to protect this small organism vs. the beauty of being entangled in time (ancestors, lineage, wisdom tradition) and space and that there’s something strange happening that makes people want to be free (like America is the land of the free) and that this country innovates a lot yet does it without doing it in a container. The idea that disruptive innovation is a good thing is insane - we don’t need to have manufactured needs or planned obsolescence.**\n\nThis reflection touches on the complexities of individualism and its implications:\n\n- **Individualism vs. Collectivism:** While individualism emphasizes personal freedom and autonomy, it can lead to isolation and a disconnection from community and tradition. Conversely, collectivist cultures value interconnectedness and shared responsibility but may suppress personal expression.\n\n- **Innovation and Its Discontents:** The valorization of disruptive innovation can result in negative consequences, such as environmental degradation, social displacement, and the erosion of traditions. Planned obsolescence contributes to waste and consumer dissatisfaction.\n\n- **Balancing Freedom and Responsibility:** The challenge lies in fostering innovation and personal freedom while maintaining a sense of responsibility to community, environment, and future generations.\n\nThis underscores the need for a more integrated approach that honors both individual agency and collective well-being.\n\nIn summary, these explorations reveal the intricate interplay between cultural, religious, and economic factors that have shaped contemporary attitudes towards labor, ownership, and community. Understanding these dynamics can inform efforts to cultivate a more balanced and relational worldview. ",

      "content": "### **Answers to the Key Questions: Mapping the Great Disconnection**\n\nYour questions are crucial because they help illuminate the deeper forces at work behind our current worldview. Let’s systematically break them down and answer them.\n\n---\n\n## **1. How do we trace these transformations without falling into simplistic \"golden age\" thinking?**\n> *The Catholic Church example shows how institutions can both preserve and destroy relationship/meaning.*\n\n### **Answer: There were never purely “good old days,” only shifting trade-offs.**\n- **Tradition was never static** – it was always being shaped by changing conditions, power struggles, and cultural evolutions.\n- **Every era balanced relational & hierarchical forces** – The Catholic Church kept craft traditions alive (monasteries, guilds) while also centralizing and controlling meaning.\n- **New paradigms solve old problems but create new ones** – Protestantism removed Catholic hierarchy but also disenchanted labor. Capitalism made work \"efficient\" but also exploitative.\n- **Natural principles were often maintained at the margins** – Monks, mystics, guild artisans, and peasant communities often preserved relational ways of being while dominant institutions moved toward abstraction.\n\n### **How to avoid golden age nostalgia in the book:**\n- Focus on **patterns of separation** instead of moralizing about specific eras.\n- Show how **each shift gained something but lost something else** (e.g., Protestantism decentralized spirituality but also led to work as an anxious performance for grace).\n- Highlight **where relational approaches persisted**—in craft traditions, gift economies, and alternative ways of being.\n\n---\n\n## **2. What made the Western European path uniquely destructive of relationship and meaning?**\n> *Other civilizations had banks, technology, and hierarchies but didn’t develop this particular form of separation.*\n\n### **Answer: Western Europe’s unique trajectory was shaped by a mix of geography, war, religion, and economics.**\nWhile other civilizations had finance, cities, and power structures, **Europe's combination of these factors led to a distinct path**:\n\n### **Geographical Factors**\n- **Fragmented landscape**: Unlike China or the Middle East, Western Europe lacked centralized empires for long stretches of history, creating competitive and aggressive state formation.\n- **Harsh climate + agricultural dependence**: This created an obsession with controlling land and extracting surplus for security.\n- **Colonial \"advantage\"**: The ability to expand westward (via the Atlantic) gave European states an alternative to internal collapse—external conquest.\n\n### **Religious Factors**\n- **Catholic hierarchy + Protestant reaction**: The Catholic Church centralized spiritual authority but preserved embodied practice. Protestantism rejected hierarchy but also devalued collective ritual and physicality.\n- **Dualism inherited from Greek thought**: The split between “mind” and “body” (via Plato, Descartes, etc.) was embedded into Western epistemology.\n- **Suspicion of the mystical**: Unlike Hinduism, Sufism, or Taoism, Western Christianity struggled to integrate direct mystical experience, leading to a reliance on external validation of truth.\n\n### **Economic & Technological Factors**\n- **Enclosure Movement**: Medieval communal landholding was systematically dismantled, forcing peasants into wage labor.\n- **Interest-based banking**: Unlike Islamic or Buddhist economies, Europe embraced money as a self-replicating entity, severing wealth from real productivity.\n- **Scientific abstraction**: The mechanistic worldview of the 17th century allowed nature to be seen as something to **measure and control** rather than participate in.\n\n### **How to explore this in the book:**\n- Show that **Europe wasn’t “smarter” but had a unique confluence of pressures** (war, land, religion) that led to mechanization.\n- Compare with **alternative histories**—China’s Admiral Zheng He had the tech to colonize the world but didn’t.\n- Emphasize **how controlling nature led to controlling people**, reinforcing the idea that worldview dictates systems.\n\n---\n\n## **3. How do we recognize and work with \"natural principles\" without either romanticizing the past or creating new forms of control?**\n> *How do we integrate tradition and relationality without falling into hierarchy or rigid dogma?*\n\n### **Answer: The key is recognizing that natural principles emerge from practice, not ideology.**\n- **Tradition is a process, not a static rulebook.** The best traditional societies (e.g., guilds, monasteries, peasant commons) allowed for adaptation, experimentation, and embodied knowledge.\n- **Genuine relational ways of being require ongoing participation.** A garden is alive because it’s continually tended, not because it follows one rigid template.\n- **We need modern structures that function like ecosystems, not machines.** Instead of returning to old institutions, we can apply **biological wisdom** (regenerative economies, community-supported agriculture, apprenticeship-based learning).\n\n### **How to make this concrete in the book:**\n- Show examples of **living traditions** that evolve rather than stagnate (e.g., permaculture, worker cooperatives, open-source communities).\n- Highlight **practices over theories**—learning through doing rather than just discussing.\n- Provide **ways forward that invite participation** instead of top-down control.\n\n---\n\n## **4. What role did America play as a land of immigrants in severing relational ties?**\n> *How did moving to a \"new world\" accelerate the loss of lineage and tradition?*\n\n### **Answer: America’s immigrant experience required reinvention, but at the cost of severing deep roots.**\n- **Relational traditions degraded in transit.** European immigrants often brought pieces of culture (food, names) but lost the holistic web of communal obligations.\n- **Land abundance created a new mindset.** Unlike Europe, where land was fought over for centuries, America offered land as an “infinite” resource—this encouraged ownership over stewardship.\n- **Capitalism filled the void.** Without deep communal structures, the measuring stick for success became financial—leading to the “wealth equals worth” ideology.\n- **The American Dream = A self-made myth.** The idea of **breaking from the past** became a foundational myth, reinforcing individualism.\n\n### **How to explore this in the book:**\n- Show the **psychological cost of severing lineage**—loneliness, anxiety, the search for meaning.\n- Compare America’s story with **other immigrant experiences**—Jewish diaspora communities retained tight relational structures despite migration, while many European immigrants did not.\n- Highlight how **the need for belonging gets redirected into nationalism, consumerism, and corporate identity**.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Is the modern global worldview “Neo-Rome”?**\n> *Are we simply repeating the Roman Empire’s trajectory, or is this something different?*\n\n### **Answer: It’s Rome—but on steroids, and with a different operating system.**\n- **Similarities:**\n  - Expansion via conquest (military and economic).\n  - Centralized power with bureaucratic complexity.\n  - Bread and circuses (distraction economy).\n  - Citizens as consumers rather than active participants.\n\n- **Differences:**\n  - Rome was hierarchical; modern capitalism is decentralized but algorithmically governed.\n  - Rome relied on physical force; modern power relies on data and financial systems.\n  - Rome collapsed through overextension; the global order may be collapsing through **disconnection** rather than expansion.\n\n### **How to make this point in the book:**\n- Show that **Rome’s fall wasn’t just military but relational**—overextension made citizens passive.\n- Compare **empire management vs. distributed capitalism**—who holds the power?\n- Ask whether **Neo-Rome can avoid collapse through reconnection rather than further abstraction.**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Takeaways:**\n- **We are not doomed, but we must recognize the patterns.** The shift from relational to abstracted ways of being isn’t inevitable—it’s a choice reinforced by incentives.\n- **Reconnection starts with practice, not ideology.** Living systems require participation—learning a craft, tending relationships, being in community.\n- **Alternative worldviews already exist.** Indigenous economic systems, monastic traditions, and craft-based approaches offer blueprints.\n- **The future is about recombination.** The best way forward isn’t regression, but integration—blending the wisdom of the past with the capacities of the present.\n\nWould you like to go deeper into any of these areas? The **pattern of separation** seems to be the central thread—showing how we lost relational ways of being, and how we might reclaim them without repeating past mistakes.",

      "content": "Yeah, I think it's really important to actually not have this golden age-y idea and like the idea that the other is better, like the indigenous and decolonize everything, because the idea is that not only is it possible to redeem the Western civilization, but there are threads that are still alive in Western civilization that are connected to this relational approach that we can double down on and encourage and see as real even today in a way that will help us activate it. So for instance, there are still guilds and trades and I'm not sure who those German people are that kind of carry sticks and they have to like travel around Germany and like learn a craft and then they walk like a long kind of pilgrimage path. I forget their name, but I think they still exist. And then even, not even theirs, like when we are all children, right, like we play with each other and we connect and we have periods of like wanting for ourselves and no to everything and then we learn to share and we learn to appreciate like playing with other people and you know we want friends and we connect and we play and we explore and we explore the world and very often we love nature. I don't know, maybe there's some people deprived because they grew up in cities, but really like even animals, right, and pets and this idea of like do you love your pet because it makes you feel good or do you love your pet, period, you know. And I think there's also different kinds of love that we can talk about, like love with respect and just love because of existence. I'm not exactly sure like why people love their pets, but they love their pets, you know. And then we can use these little doorways of like, you know, what is that, what does it mean, what does it imply, like what you use to love your pet, what's happening in you when you love your pet, you know. And instead of being like, oh ancient societies, like we have to get back into like talking to trees and you know having a shaman and you know people go to Auroville in India or Peru and do ayahuasca and think that's the only place to have this kind of communion. No, communion can happen here where you are and we have to like, just like, you know, you have 24 hours in your day and most of them don't touch that place of togetherness, connection, meaning. Even if it's just like in that moment before dinner, like there was a time when we would connect to the food and each other and French people still had that, right? In French culture, people would go home for lunch and then they would go back to work and that like, there's a respect also of the meal and of the togetherness and, you know, coming together and, you know, a lot of these things are like, ah, that's just like tradition and culture and it's just, you know, some kind of formal way of talking about polite culture or manners, but these manners have like deep and profound meanings and if we could just, instead of looking at them as something to like let go of and seeing as more and more French companies start encouraging American kind of entrepreneurial like hacky culture where people are eating on the job at their desk instead of, you know, taking two-hour-long lunch breaks which makes them quote-unquote less efficient, but maybe it's okay to be less efficient if you're actually alive and so I think we need to like say like, here, look, it existed, it wasn't that long ago that we still have these remnants and even today we have the remnants. Let's just make more of that, you know? You know, in French culture, if you don't go home anymore, can you extend your lunch break by 30 minutes or deepen the quality of your lunch break by not talking about work or, you know, like can we just slowly progress towards this rather than making it about a golden age and about other people and about other ways of being, just showing how it was here and how they show up and how it just wants to come back alive, you know, and that's the thing. It's like a plant that just needs a little bit of watering. It's going to come back, it's going to bear fruit and this is why it's so important to say this because it's also about the speed of the transformation isn't about like people suddenly becoming, you know, complete hippies and leaving the culture and going to India or making these big drastic changes. It's like, holy crap, the changes are subtle and right here and create contentedness and the transition can be fast because it's right at the edge of what's possible now rather than some big transition into going completely green and then instead of like being this kind of demand of like, here's how the world needs to change. It's like, here's the subtle perceptual shift that you can be taking today to bring meaning and joy and connection and love into your life that you want. All those things that you think you get through the systems of domination and working so that you can party on the weekend, like just try to have a moment of grace before dinner or lunch, you know, and if you can't access it, just make space for silence and see what emerges and things like that I think are really powerful. Yeah. Yeah. Unique pressures that led to these things and like we have some unique pressures again today. So like, what were the unique pressures? It's like, yeah, fragmented landscapes because of the mountains and harsh climate. Yeah, people needing to figure stuff out. Although I'm not sure that's true because we have like the indigenous tribes still in like Finland and Sweden, the Sagi, Savi, I forget their name, who have different ways of being even in these cold and treacherous climates, right? So I think there's something like we might be able to do better at coming up with the factors, religious factors, factors, economic and technological factors. So all those factors that you're saying is that it's not a unique confluence of pressures, war, land and religion that led to mechanization. It's sort of like the war, land, war and religion and mechanization are all the same thing. The land is the one thing that's actually like an external factor. The question is, why did the mindset develop? Is it just because of the land and climate? What else could it be about this environment that led these different sort of ways of thinking? And maybe part of it is just the reality of having so many different people close together. But yeah, I think it definitely relates to the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic Church and the fragmented city states and how they evolve over time without a unifying thing, right? I'm not sure actually. Is it the Eastern Orthodox versus the Roman Catholic and the Protestants? How did this religious war stuff start? Why didn't Christianity just unify people? It's probably because there was a usage of Christianity to disconnect, right? Devices disconnect us. Natural principles without romanticizing. Yeah, tradition is a process. Yeah, land abundance came at the expense of the indigenous people with violence, right? So yeah, I think that we need to learn more about Rome. Is there a book that describes this fall well? And also a book that describes the Black Plague and a book that describes the religious wars in Europe. I think all of these would be really great. What else am I missing that might be some really important factors that can help us get some clarity about why this way of seeing the world emerged?",

      "content": "Your emphasis on revitalizing existing relational practices within Western civilization is insightful. Identifying and nurturing these traditions can foster a more connected and meaningful way of life without resorting to idealized notions of a \"golden age\" or entirely looking to other cultures.\n\n**Contemporary Relational Practices in Western Culture:**\n\n- **Craft Guilds and Traditions:** In countries like Germany, the tradition of the \"Wandergesellen\" (journeymen) persists. These craftspeople undertake journeys to various regions, honing their skills under different masters, embodying a deep connection to their craft and community.\n\n- **Culinary Traditions:** French culture, for instance, places a strong emphasis on communal meals. The practice of taking time to share meals reflects a commitment to relational living and appreciation of quality time.\n\n- **Childhood Play:** The natural inclination of children to engage in imaginative play and form friendships highlights an inherent human desire for connection and shared experiences.\n\n**Historical Factors Influencing Western Worldviews:**\n\nUnderstanding the unique historical pressures that shaped Western thought can provide context for current societal structures:\n\n- **Geographical Fragmentation:** The diverse landscapes of Europe led to the development of numerous distinct societies, fostering competition and innovation but also conflict.\n\n- **Religious Schisms:** Divisions within Christianity, such as the split between Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, followed by the Protestant Reformation, created theological and cultural rifts that influenced societal development.\n\n- **Economic Transformations:** Movements like the Enclosure in England displaced many from communal lands, leading to urban migration and the rise of individualistic economic models.\n\n**Recommended Readings:**\n\nTo delve deeper into these topics, consider the following works:\n\n- **The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization** by Bryan Ward-Perkins: This book examines the decline of the Roman Empire, providing insights into the societal transformations that ensued. citeturn0search2\n\n- **In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made** by Norman F. Cantor: Cantor explores the profound impacts of the Black Death on European society, shedding light on how such crises reshape worldviews. citeturn0search1\n\n- **The World the Plague Made: The Black Death and the Rise of Europe** by James Belich: Belich offers a comprehensive analysis of how the Black Death influenced the socio-economic rise of Europe. citeturn0search13\n\n- **The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire** by Edward Gibbon: A seminal work that provides an extensive narrative on the factors leading to Rome's decline. citeturn0search21\n\nBy exploring these resources and reflecting on existing relational practices, we can work towards a more connected and meaningful society that honors both historical context and contemporary realities. ",

Let's summarize where we are and explore some additional perspectives.\\n\\n**Current Snapshot:**\\n\\nWe're examining the tension between relational, interconnected ways of living and the more disconnected, individualistic worldview that has become dominant in modern Western society. Key themes include:\\n\\n- **Historical Transformations:** The shift from community and craft to individualism and mechanization.\\n- **Revitalizing Traditions:** Recognizing and nurturing existing relational practices within Western cultures.\\n\\n**Expanding Perspectives:**\\n\\n1. **Broader Global Context:**\\n   - **Eastern Philosophies:** Consider how non-Western philosophies, such as Daoism or Indigenous worldviews, offer insights into living in harmony with nature and each other. These perspectives could provide complementary practices for integrating more holistic ways of living.\\n   \\n2. **Psychological Insights:**\\n   - **Modern Neuroscience and Psychology:** Explore how contemporary understanding of the mind supports relational living. Concepts like neuroplasticity, mirror neurons, and the importance of social connections could bolster the argument for a relational approach.\\n\\n3. **Environmental Stewardship:**\\n   - **Ecological Movements:** Investigate how current environmental efforts, such as permaculture or regenerative agriculture, align with the relational approach. These movements emphasize working with natural systems rather than dominating them and could offer practical applications.\\n\\n4. **Cultural Revitalization:**\\n   - **Revival of Traditions:** Look at examples of how communities are rediscovering and revitalizing their cultural heritage. This could be as simple as preserving local languages or as complex as reconstructing traditional social structures.\\n\\n5. **Personal Practice:**\\n   - **Mindfulness and Contemplative Practices:** Highlight how personal practices like mindfulness, meditation, or simply spending time in nature can cultivate the relational mindset. These practices can be powerful tools for individuals to reconnect with themselves and their surroundings.\\n\\n**Moving Forward:**\\nTo advance this conversation, consider:\\n\\n- **Integrating Diverse Perspectives:** Incorporate insights from various cultural, ecological, and philosophical traditions to create a more robust framework for relational living.\\n\\n- **Practical Applications:** Develop concrete strategies for integrating these principles into everyday life, from organizational practices to personal habits.\\n\\n- **Historical and Contemporary Examples:** Continue researching historical and contemporary examples of relational living to provide inspiration and practical models.\\n\\nWould you like to explore specific examples or resources further?

Examples include cooperative businesses or B Corps that aim for a triple bottom line (people, planet, profit).\\n\\n3. **Educational Approaches:** Educational models that emphasize holistic, experiential learning—like Montessori or Waldorf—can serve as blueprints for cultivating relational ways of thinking from a young age.\\n\\n4. **Artistic Movements:** Art forms and movements that prioritize process, community, and expression over commercial success can also be inspiring.\\n\\n**Underappreciated Elements:**\\n\\nOne of the unique contributions in this conversation is the idea of **subtle, everyday practices** as powerful agents of transformation. Rather than advocating for dramatic changes, focusing on small, meaningful shifts in daily life can be more accessible and impactful. This emphasis on micro-practices—like the French tradition of shared meals or mindful moments before dinner—can be a fresh take that resonates with a wide audience.\\n\\n**Broadening Perspectives:**\\n\\nTo broaden the perspective:\\n\\n- **Systems Thinking:** Explore how systems thinking can integrate these relational approaches into larger social, economic, and environmental systems. This holistic view could help identify leverage points for meaningful change.\\n\\n- **Emerging Technologies:** Consider how new technologies, like decentralized networks or regenerative practices, could align with these values and offer new pathways forward.\\n\\n- **Interdisciplinary Dialogue:** Foster conversations across disciplines—linking insights from fields like ecology, psychology, and anthropology—to enrich the conversation and discover innovative solutions.\\n\\n**Next Steps:**\\n- **Identify Specific Examples:** Research specific communities, organizations, or movements that embody these principles and could serve as case studies.\\n\\n- **Develop Practical Guides:** Create resources or guides that help individuals and organizations integrate these relational practices into their daily lives.\\n\\n- **Facilitate Dialogue:** Organize or participate in interdisciplinary discussions that bring together diverse viewpoints and expertise.\\n\\nWould you like to dive deeper into any particular context or example?
