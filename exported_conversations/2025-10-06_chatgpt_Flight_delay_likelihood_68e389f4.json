      "content": "Good question — and it depends on a few practical and airline-specific factors. Here’s how it generally works:  \n\n### 1. **Airline Priorities**\n- Airlines are **heavily penalized** for late departures in terms of on-time performance metrics, gate scheduling, and sometimes even airport fees. So, **the default is to depart on time**.  \n- That said, airlines don’t want to leave behind a large group of passengers if it can be avoided, because it means more rebooking costs, hotel vouchers, and unhappy customers.  \n\n### 2. **Factors That Affect the Decision**\n- **Number of passengers missing:** If it’s just a handful, they’ll usually close the door on time. If it’s dozens (say, due to a late incoming connecting flight), they may hold the plane briefly.  \n- **Reason for the delay:** If the long line is at **security or check-in** and it’s airport-wide, the airline might coordinate with the airport to delay a little. If it’s just because some people showed up late, they won’t usually wait.  \n- **Air traffic control (ATC):** Sometimes the flight can’t depart immediately anyway because of congestion, so they may take the extra minutes to board stragglers.  \n- **Hub vs. non-hub:** At a hub airport (like Atlanta for Delta, or Frankfurt for Lufthansa), the airline is more likely to hold flights for connecting passengers because they control more of the schedule and have many rebooking options.  \n- **Last flight of the day vs. multiple frequencies:** If it’s the final flight to that destination, they may be more lenient and wait.  \n\n### 3. **Operational Reality**\n- Boarding typically **closes 15–30 minutes before departure**, depending on airline and destination (international flights are stricter).  \n- Once the aircraft door is closed, the departure time is locked, and reopening it is a **major operational disruption** (they need to redo paperwork, sometimes re-scan boarding passes, even re-do weight and balance).  \n\n### **In practice:**  \n- If a **significant number of passengers are delayed by airport issues** (not their own fault), the flight might be held 10–20 minutes.  \n- If it’s just a long line because of passengers showing up late, **the plane will almost always leave on time**.  \n- They balance customer goodwill vs. cascading delays (one late flight can throw off schedules for the whole day).  \n\n👉 So: **Likelihood of waiting = low for individual passengers, medium if it’s a large group due to airport/airline issues, high if there are connecting passengers from another flight the airline wants to accommodate.**\n\nDo you want me to give you a breakdown of *what’s most likely* if you’re just in a long security line at the airport (vs. coming off a late connection)?",

      "content": "The **door-close time** is one of the most important cutoffs in air travel — after that point, you’re basically out of luck. Airlines don’t all follow the exact same rule, but there are some typical patterns:  \n\n---\n\n### **Domestic Flights (within one country)**\n- **Most U.S. carriers**: doors close **10–15 minutes before scheduled departure**.  \n  - Example: Delta, United, American: 15 min.  \n  - Southwest: closer to **10 min** (since they have faster boarding).  \n- **European short-haul**: often **15–20 minutes** before.  \n\n---\n\n### **International Flights**\n- Doors usually close **30 minutes before departure**.  \n  - Airlines want extra buffer for passport checks, long boarding lines, and weight/balance paperwork.  \n- Some stricter carriers (e.g., Emirates, Singapore, Lufthansa long-haul) may close **35–45 minutes before departure**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Check-in vs. Boarding vs. Door Close**\n- **Check-in counter cutoff:** Often **45–60 minutes before departure** (domestic), **60–75 minutes** (international).  \n- **Boarding begins:** Usually **30–50 minutes before departure**.  \n- **Boarding cutoff / doors close:**  \n  - Domestic: ~15 min  \n  - International: ~30 min (sometimes 45)  \n\n---\n\n### **Why it matters**  \n- Once the **aircraft door is closed**, the crew must redo paperwork if it’s reopened, which delays everyone.  \n- Airlines prefer to **push back exactly on schedule** because that’s what counts as \"on time\" — even if they sit on the tarmac afterwards.  \n\n---\n\n👉 If you’re at security wondering if you’ll make it:  \n- Domestic flight → you generally need to be at the gate **20 minutes before departure**.  \n- International flight → you need to be there **at least 45 minutes before departure**, ideally earlier.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to make you a **table of major airlines’ official door-close times** (Delta, United, American, Lufthansa, Emirates, etc.), so you can see the differences?",

      "content": "When you wrote “HO or AJET,” I assume by **“HO”** you meant **Juneyao Airlines (IATA code HO)**, and by **“AJET”** you meant the Turkish low-cost carrier **AJet** (formerly AnadoluJet). If you meant different airlines, let me know and I’ll correct.\n\nHere’s what I found:\n\n---\n\n## 🛫 Juneyao Airlines (HO)\n\n- Juneyao’s online check-in is open from **24 hours** before up to **90 minutes before** scheduled departure. citeturn1search30  \n- At least for stations using their global site, “Please complete check-in and seat selection 50 minutes before the flight departure.” citeturn1search9  \n- These are **check-in / boarding pass issuance** times—not necessarily the moment the aircraft door closes.\n\nSo, for HO, a safe assumption is that the **door closes** roughly **10 to 20 minutes before departure**, as is common in many airlines. (The final boarding “gate close” is within that window after check-in and boarding have been completed.)\n\n---\n\n## 🛫 AJet (AnadoluJet / Turkish low-cost)\n\n- According to AJet’s own “services/free-check-in,” airport check-in counters **close 45 minutes before take-off** for domestic flights and **60 minutes before take-off** for international flights. citeturn0search0  \n- Other sources (such as Wingie) repeat that AJet’s airport check-in (including baggage drop) must be done at least **45 minutes ahead for domestic**, **60 minutes ahead for international** flights. citeturn0search8  \n- Their online check-in window opens 24 hours before and closes 1 hour before departure. citeturn0search23turn0search5  \n\nSo for AJet, the **door close / boarding gate cut-off** is likely to occur **somewhere after the check-in cut-off**, typically **10 to 20 minutes before departure**, though I didn't find an exact statement.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Summary & What You Should Assume\n\n- For **HO (Juneyao)**, assume door/gate closing ~10–20 min before scheduled departure (after check-in and boarding).  \n- For **AJet**, you must check in at the counter by 45 min (domestic) or 60 min (international) before, so boarding and door closure should happen in the window after that—again typically **10–20 min before departure**.  \n- Always check the specific flight’s “boarding close” or “gate close” time in your booking or from the airline, as rules may vary by airport or route.\n\nIf you like, I can try to dig into AJet’s and Juneyao’s official documents (e.g. their AOCs, conditions of carriage) to find *exact* door-close rules. Want me to do that?",
