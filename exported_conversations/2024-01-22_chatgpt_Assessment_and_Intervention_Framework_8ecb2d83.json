      "content": "can you summarize this document and pull out the deep insights? \nAssessment and Intervention Theory (July 2020) \n\nThis doc is old, though there are helpful notes below; see updated version at: Bloom Framework v0.6 - Two Pillars (draft - shared) \n\n\nStart Here: To start the soft skills assessment process, follow the SkillsBuilder Bloom registration link: https://airtable.com/shrFcISXWD7n7PGAQ \n\nBloom’s name refers to the sudden and seeming miraculous reviving of life in a desert after a rain. The super bloom happens when the waters of opportunity rain down on the seeds of potential. Our approach to assessing and intervening is to fulfill our mission to nurture the hidden potential within people in our programs as well as people using our methodology to bring out the gifts we all have to offer improving our lives while improving the world around us.\n\nThere are many factors that comprise success in work and in life. Bloom’s assessment and intervention theory takes the approach that how and why we do things are at least as important as what we do. We believe that entrepreneurship is an attitude of agency and responsibility and is an attitude that can be nurtured. Through our educational experiences, accelerators and other project based learning experiences, we strive to help people solve problems by developing problem solving mindsets, to develop interpersonally by taking on projects which requires and nurtures listening skills, and most importantly to help our participants better understand themselves, the world around them and how to act with integrity and beauty. \n\nWe identify three domains and three approaches to learning about one’s motivation, one’s self and one’s expertise and that these three together synergistically allow for collaborative co-creation, learning by doing necessary to navigate in a world of uncertainty and complexity.\nThe model of self that Bloom takes maps to our assessment and intervention framework. \nThe Internal.

Through extensive research and our own experience over the last 13 years, we have developed this basic framework for our programs, including: \nAssessment Areas: Following the saying “what gets measured gets improved”, we’re using and enhancing quantifiable assessments for each aspect of our work. \nAccelerator Tools: We use these in our programs, and our training of trainer support programs. \nEnterprise Tools: Our direct enterprise support programs focus on these elements. \n\nAssess inputs (of the programs, enterprises, and individuals) (Baseline)\n#\nAssessment Areas\nAccelerator Tools\nIndividual\nEnterprise Tools\n1\nMotivation & Engagement\n(Metacognitive - Why)\nInspiration and wellbeing at work\nEngagement / Leaderboard (for program) \nMotivation  - intrinsic/extrinsic\nCharacter Traits and Values(Ex: Authenticity/Honesty, Leadership, Zest, Fairness, Gratitude, Persistence, Teamwork, Curiosity)\nAnchor character traits that support enterprise development. \n2\nPersonal and Interpersonal Skills\n(How)\nSoft skills development tools and methods \nProblem Solving (critical thinking, adaptability)\nCreativity (ideation, divergent thinking)\nCommunication (written, spoken, listening) \nCollaboration (working with others, time management) \nLeadership and Self Leadership (goal setting, pivoting, growth mindset)\nEssential soft skills that support enterprise development\n3 \nEnterprise Expertise\n(What) \n\n\n\n\nExpertise development and training approaches\nCEO - Chief Exec (Next steps, milestones)\nCFO - Finance, Procurement, Auditing ->  (Customer & Market))\nCOO - Operations, Facilities, Logistics\nCHRO - Human resources, people operations, culture, happiness  \nCMO - Marketing and Communications \nCRO - Revenues, Sales, Pricing \nCTO - Technology, Product, Research, Data Science -> javascript \nCLO - Legal and Compliance \nCSO - Strategy, Security, and Risk\n\n\nEssential hard skill and enterprise development areas. Five Pillar Slides. \n4\nEnterprise Strategy\nFrameworks: (Pitchdeck (this is 3) & OCAT)\nOrganizational development tools and approaches (mentoring, enterprise monitoring, 1-on-1 support) \nCore skills related to the 5 Pillar Slides. \n(Check list)\nProblem (Challenge, Market Gap) (customer research, problem/gap analysis)  \nSolution / Value Proposition (prototyping, technical development) \nCustomer & Market (market research, marketing, communications)\nBusiness Model (strategy, platform design, revenue/cost models)\nTeam & Work Plan (team development, project management, HR) \n\nSkills from Everywhere (FOR INDIVIDUALS)\nENTERPRISE REALITY METRICS: KPIs. \n\nIndividual contribution to the Enterprise KPIs. \nOKRs go down to the individual level. \n\n\nEnterprise development and hitting KPIs, and Organizational Growth (OCAT, etc.)\n\nSystems Development & Execution: \n• Customer Acquisition\n• Customer Retention \n• Revenues \n• Profitability \n• Team Growth, Effectiveness, and Retention (HR KPIs) \n5\nResults\n\nBusiness & Social Impact Metrics \nImpact assessment training and monitoring focusing on SDGs \nTechnical?\nSDG metrics monitoring system.

The Metacognitive. The Will. (Spirit, etc.)\nThe Universal. The Mind. The Emotional. The Soft Skills.\nThe Specialized. The Hand. The Abstract. The Practical. Expertise. \n\nI think it can go into a page that separately describes each element. I like the there as it distinguishes things in the metacognitive domain- anything you might talk about that might be described as having an origin that's related to a supra you (thinking about thinking, motivation, the way you comprehend - all this is meta. It's also closely tied with the wellbeing layer) \n\n“The Internal” is non-body, non-mind, because it requires a transcendent view of self to redesign. It can be noticed when one day, while journaling, after years following a routine you may notice that something is off and you need more meaning to your work and life. You cannot change a system embedded in it. A Self-Transforming mind is the way it is described by Robert Kegan and it requires a high level of mental complexity. \n\nThe Universal is inhabited in the body and mind as it stands today. It can be seen by others through your daily behaviors and actions. It might be reviewed on a team 360 evaluation. It can also be self assessed. It’s related to the individual’s listening skills, problem solving skills, and other soft skills. They can also be practiced as a tool, before a deeper transformation happens. For instance, you can count to 10 after people speak to make room for others who may not respond quickly to practice deep listening. This is a physical action that, over time, can influence your perception of self and others, and how you may score both on the soft skill dimension of listening, and on a more metacognitive dimension of Love / Kindness. \n\nThe Specialized. These are abilities that anyone can learn, although some have greater ease learning, and some have innate tallant. Anyone can learn to program a computer, knowledge of law is available for anyone who puts in effort to read/ memorize. This is put to service The Internal and Universal. \n\nThe Internal describes the why and guides the development of the Individual Soft Skills and the Individuals Expertise.\n\nThe Internal layer is where the will comes into effect to determine who the Mind needs to be and what the Hand needs to do. They are both three tiers and for the individual they are nested if people are to be aligned with purpose. This is where values are alive and social entrepreneurship can truly be social, responsibility is managing your mind to manage what specific skills you need to learn. This comes from access and work on the metacognitive domain.\nIntervention Philosophy:\nPrinciple 1: “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is an act, not a habit.”\n\nPrinciple 2: What you want to do is greater than who you think you currently are.\n\nPrinciple 2 rearticulated: We can develop the soft skills and expertise we need to be in service of our higher values. \n\nIn a time of uncertainty and change an education that focuses on a specific outcome will become outdated quickly. An education that focuses on techniques and practical skills is limited to the specific application which requires those practical skills. Moreover, those skills are values-neutral and may not necessarily lead someone and the communities impacted by their actions in the direction they want to go. \n\nThis is why Bloom focuses on inputs in parallel with practical skills. If we support people in developing the skill of listening for vocation (from Vocare which means to call) and to recognize their agency, develop self efficacy, and sharpen their critical thinking we focus on what is not only the highest leverage skills, but also the skills that will support people in discovering their path towards meaning and purpose in a world which is rapidly evolving.\n\nMany people are graduates of an industrial education which is slowly evolving. An education in which a clear career shows up at the end of a process of skill development. This process of production of practical competencies is becoming less relevant as automation technologies are replacing human needs. The issue is that an industrial education produces employees which receive specifications for clearer tasks and look to authorities for confirmation of a job successfully accomplished. The relationship between the scores of grade A machine screws, grade A beef, and a human with straight A’s is not a serendipitous coincidence. \n\nKeeping in mind the transforming nature of work, we see the entrepreneurial ethos as a shorthand for returning autonomy, self efficacy, self determination, moral responsibility for how we choose to create value and create our source of financial remuneration to people. Once the recognition is made that we are co-creating our world, and that business pressures are some of the strongest pressures for many of the consequences we see in the world it naturally leads to entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs willing to create change.\n\nPeople coming from an aligned and highly motivated place find practical skills acquisition, collaboration, problem solving easier to address. \n\n\nThere are many subsets of “essential skills” which have been proposed. \nThe following pages are research, maps, and notes which have been digested and summarized into the above. \n\nDig at your own risk. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\nSpirit: AKA, Wellbeing / Emotional Intelligence / Meta cognitive processes example:\nMotivation\nComplexity CLAS (Theo)\nAgency\nEfficacy\nVIA\nMind: Soft skills/Real Skills/21st Century Skills\nHand: Expertise/Hard skills/Technical skills\n\nUsing the mappings between the psychometrically valid VIA/LSCE - which we currently have a tool for and the Skills Builder competencies - we can have a pre and post test which is comparable while also offering clear actions to offer teams with the library consisting of both the skills builder and the VIA. \n\n\n\nThe 5:\nAll of this is under a frame of taking care of yourself / having Emotional Intelligence (Self Management from SB), Grit, Growth Mindset leveraging character strengths, etc:\n\nThree basic clumps:\nCreativity - Creativity and Innovation - coming up with ideas\nBeing together/sharing\nCommunication listening speaking - communication - selling ideas\nCollaboration /Leadership  - going together \nAdaptability / Staying positive - growth orientation (self management from SB)\nCritical Thinking and Problem Solving \n\n\nOne word version:\nCreativity\nCommunication\nCollaboration\nAdaptability\nProblem-Solving \n\n\n\nBloom 5 RS\nMaps to / Synonyms\nAssessment Tool(s)*\n\n\nCreativity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration\nIncluding time management? \n\n\n\n\nAdaptability\nAiming high included here?

For people in programs it can be a mandatory workbook item.\nRelates to a feature “sticky workbook item tasks” a task can be associated with a workbook item, it is checked off when the submit button is clicked.

      "content": "The document titled \"Assessment and Intervention Theory\" (July 2020) from the Bloom Framework v0.6 outlines a comprehensive approach to soft skills assessment and intervention. It uses the metaphor of a desert's miraculous revival after rain to describe its mission of nurturing potential in people. The framework emphasizes the importance of understanding the reasons behind actions (the 'why'), the manner of performing them (the 'how'), and the nature of the actions themselves (the 'what').\n\nKey Insights:\n\n1. **Three Domains and Approaches**: Bloom identifies three critical domains - The Internal (Metacognitive, Spirit), The Universal (Mind, Emotional, Soft Skills), and The Specialized (Hand, Abstract, Practical Expertise). These domains synergistically enable collaborative co-creation and learning in uncertain, complex environments.\n\n2. **Entrepreneurial Self Model and Assessment Areas**: The document describes an entrepreneurial self model comprising three assessment areas: \n    - **The Internal (Why)**: Focuses on metacognitive aspects like motivation and spirit.\n    - **The Universal (How)**: Involves soft skills like communication, collaboration, and adaptability.\n    - **The Specialized (What)**: Pertains to practical expertise in various fields.\n\n3. **Assessment and Growth Frameworks**: Bloom uses three pillars for assessment and growth:\n    - **Personal Skills Assessment and Growth Framework (PSA)**.\n    - **Universal Skills Assessment and Growth Framework (USA)**.\n    - **Practical and Organizational Skills Assessment and Growth Framework (OSA)**.\n\n4. **Program Framework**: The Bloom Framework includes assessment areas, accelerator tools, and enterprise tools, focusing on motivation, engagement, personal and interpersonal skills, and enterprise expertise.\n\n5. **Intervention Philosophy**: Bloom's intervention philosophy is rooted in principles emphasizing consistent actions for excellence and the importance of developing skills in alignment with higher values.\n\n6. **Skills and Competencies**: The document lists various skills and competencies like creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and leadership. These are mapped across different frameworks like LSCE, VIA, SkillsBuilder, and Hello Insight.\n\n7. **Enterprise Development and Metrics**: The framework emphasizes enterprise growth, operational efficiency, and impact metrics, including business and social impact measures.\n\n8. **Assessment Principles and Tools**: Assessments are designed to be engaging, standardized, and not burdensome. Tools include pre-program, in-program, and impact assessments, focusing on different aspects of development.\n\n9. **Role of Character and Mindset**: The document stresses the importance of character and mindset, suggesting that personal transformation and skill development are interlinked.\n\n10. **Educational Approach**: Bloom advocates for an educational approach that transcends traditional, outcome-focused learning, emphasizing the development of soft skills and practical skills in parallel.\n\nIn conclusion, the Bloom Framework v0.6 presents a holistic and multifaceted approach to soft skills assessment and intervention, emphasizing personal growth, entrepreneurial mindset, and practical skill development in a rapidly changing world.",
