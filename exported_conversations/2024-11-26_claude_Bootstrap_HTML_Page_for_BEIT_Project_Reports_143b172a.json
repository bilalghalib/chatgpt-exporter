ITC is 100% \"Aid for Trade\", supporting trade that\ndelivers inclusive and sustainable development results. ITC’s mandate covers all developing countries and\ntransition economies with special emphasis on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs) Fragile States and Sub-Saharan\nAfrica. To support a more inclusive distribution of development gains, ITC works with women, youth, and\nmarginalized groups in developing countries to empower them through entrepreneurship and skills that\nprovide gateways to jobs and enterprise creation.\nThe Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq, implemented by UN-Habitat, the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), and the International Trade Centre (ITC), aims to foster decent\nwork and affordable housing. This multi-faceted initiative encompasses integrating employment-intensive\ninvestment and local resource-based approaches into Iraq's National Public Works Programme, enhancing\ncapacity for sustainable and affordable housing, promoting trade-led private sector engagement in climate-\nsmart construction, and empowering social partners for better labour market outcomes. Through these\ncomponents, BEIT focuses on gender and sustainable financing, developing sustainable financial tools and\nlegislative frameworks, forming SME cluster alliances, and fostering social dialogue and capacity building\namong social partners, all to address housing challenges, create jobs, and support SMEs while mitigating\nclimate change impacts in the housing sector.\nOutput 3.3 of the project is designed to enhance the capabilities of local businesses, particularly focusing\non young entrepreneurs, to incorporate green and innovative practices into their operations. This includes a\ncomprehensive approach to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the\ndevelopment of sustainable and innovative capabilities, especially in sectors like climate-smart solutions\nand innovative construction technology.
