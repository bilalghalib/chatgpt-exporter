(Examples of this might  include the technological advances you will bring, the creation or new markets, the planned growth of a digital technology company, the activities you will take part in outside of your direct occupation.)\n\nI am Bilal Ghalib, cofounder of Bloom.pm a social enterprise impact organization, you can get some background on Bloom here:\nBloom Company Profile\nSummer 2022\nBloom is an affiliate of AltCity Impact, a non-profit organization legally registered in Lebanon in 2015.\nAt Bloom, we are working to leverage new methods and technologies to support skills development, entrepreneurship education, and MSME development with a focus on building inclusive and impact-driven economies.\nWe do this through running programs (online and hybrid) for enterprises and accelerators to make high-quality entrepreneurship support available to everyone, everywhere, and through building online training tools for teams and program managers.\n\n\nWe also connect entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, partners, trainers, and fellows to educate better and accelerate small to medium-sized businesses aimed at solving challenges across a variety of industries and sectors.\nWe run our programs through the Bloom platform, an in-house developed online platform designed for startups and entrepreneurship programs.\nThe Bloom Team\nWe are a passionate team of 20 remote people who believe in the power of entrepreneurship and know no borders. Our team is mainly located in Lebanon, Turkey, and Europe. \nBloom Present & Past Performance\n\nThrough our online, offline, and hybrid programs, we’ve worked with thousands of individuals and over 850 teams over the last eight years, focusing on early-stage startups, small businesses, and social enterprises. \nOur teams have mobilized over $7m in next-stage funding, won prizes (national, regional, and global), and gained acceptance in top accelerators in Lebanon and worldwide. \n\nSo far, in our Lebanon Growth Accelerator program (LGA ) alone, we have helped 50 startups create 224 jobs in total; 93 of them were full-time jobs. Women filled 45% of the jobs, and 10% were for refugees. The teams in our programs grow personally and professionally on average, moving from one developmental stage to the next in our programs. You can find more information and charts on https://bloom.pm/impact-dashboard \n\nAs for me, I would bring my ability to conduct research, facilitate entrepreneurship programs and importantly build educational technology software to the UK and be looking for partnerships to help increase entrepreneurship, and specifically social entrepreneurship in the UK.",
