      "content": "Got it — you’re into that spacious, textured, sometimes mystical evening vibe — where electronics, oud/strings, and deep grooves meet. Here are some artists/albums/playlists that sit nicely in that world of Nicolas Jaar, Anouar Brahem (I think that’s who you meant by *Anwar Ibrahim*?), *Astrakan Café* (with Brahem too), and Alsarah & the Nubatones (*El Sara*).  \n\n### Recommendations  \n\n**Contemporary / Electronic + Acoustic blends**\n- **Jónsi & Alex – *Riceboy Sleeps*** (dreamy, atmospheric, slow-blooming soundscapes)  \n- **Murcof** – especially *Martes* (minimal electronic with Mexican classical samples)  \n- **Shabaka and the Ancestors** – *Wisdom of Elders* (cosmic jazz with African roots, meditative but powerful)  \n- **Four Tet – *Morning/Evening*** (blends Indian classical vocal samples with electronic pulses, very chill for evenings)  \n\n**Oud / Strings / Middle Eastern**\n- **Anouar Brahem – *Le Pas du Chat Noir*** (classic — solo piano, oud, accordion, very introspective)  \n- **Dhafer Youssef** – *Divine Shadows* or *Birds Requiem* (oud + jazz + Sufi vocals, deeply atmospheric)  \n- **Le Trio Joubran** – *Majâz* (Palestinian oud trio, poetic and flowing)  \n- **Renaud Garcia-Fons – *La Línea del Sur*** (double bass virtuoso with flamenco/Middle Eastern colors)  \n\n**Pan-African / Nubian / Arabic fusion**\n- **Tinariwen** – *Amassakoul* (desert blues, hypnotic guitar)  \n- **Oumou Sangaré – *Mogoya*** (Malian vocals with contemporary production)  \n- **Nubya Garcia – *Source*** (London jazz sax with Caribbean + African threads)  \n- **Alsarah & the Nubatones – *Silt*** (if you like *El Sara*, this is the main album to sit with)  \n\n**Playlists / Compilations**\n- *Habibi Funk* compilations (North African rare groove + funk reissues)  \n- *Nouvelle Vague Arabe* (various Middle Eastern/Arabic artists remixed in modern chill forms)  \n- *Café del Mar: Dreams* (older, but a lot of that sunset lounge mood with global instruments)  \n\nWould you like me to put together a **flowing 90-minute evening sequence** (like a DJ would, starting soft, deepening, then resolving) so you could just press play and have that arc?",
