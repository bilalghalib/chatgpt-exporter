It could be that the \"@next\" tag is not supported by the Bootstrap package, or it might not have been published yet.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you can try installing the latest version of Bootstrap without the \"@next\" tag by running the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install bootstrap @popperjs/core\n```\n\nThis will install the latest stable version of Bootstrap and the Popper.js library. If you specifically need a pre-release version of Bootstrap, you can check the Bootstrap repository on GitHub to see if any pre-release versions are available.",
