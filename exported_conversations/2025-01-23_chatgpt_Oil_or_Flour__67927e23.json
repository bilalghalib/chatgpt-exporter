      "content": "To make your kubba dough stick together, you can try the following tips:\n\n1. **Add a little oil**: Adding a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil or olive oil can help bind the dough and make it smoother.\n\n2. **Flour**: If the dough feels too wet or crumbly, adding a small amount of all-purpose flour can help bring it together. Add a tablespoon at a time and knead until the desired consistency is reached.\n\n3. **More Semolina**: If you want to keep the texture traditional, you can add more semolina instead of flour. Soak it slightly in water before mixing to avoid drying out the dough.\n\n4. **Water**: Sometimes, just a small splash of water can help bind the mixture. Add little by little and knead thoroughly.\n\n5. **Knead Well**: Make sure you knead the mixture for a few minutes to help the ingredients stick together better.\n\nLet me know how it turns out!",

You can broil it for 1–2 minutes at the end to give it a nice color.\n- Brush the top with a little oil or melted butter before baking for a more even, crispy surface.\n- Check the edges; they should pull away slightly from the pan when done.\n\nLet me know if you need more help!",
