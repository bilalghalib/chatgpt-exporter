      "content": "Writing from today: turn it into an essay and then break it down into components and analyze it \n“”” Okay, so this one's to my headphones That's All right here we go so we're going out for a run in the citadel it's a chilly day.\n\nThat's okay.\n\nIt's meant to be a chilly day.\n\nAnd here we go.\n\nSo ah I love it.\n\nOkay so that I haven enough for everything.\n\nAnd I'm growing into the woods and I had a lunch date with my wife's in We have have opportunities on the outside of projects to do something interesting.\n\nSo you know what maybe we should talk with some entrepreneur about their experiences and programs and the kind of support that they really need.\n\nI could reach out to the Xens and maybe I can find ways of making this project more research back and research ori answered.\n\nIt's actually coming up very soon, so I need to do some thinking sooner rather than later.\n\nOkay.\n\nWe are in the woods.\n\nIt's quite cold.\n\nBut I think it's great.\n\nI love being inside.\n\nOh, a black squirrel.\n\nWhat's on that?\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd so for this autho project we had some opera a couple of opportunities simultaneous some of the opportunities that we have are to take this moment to talk about better economics.\n\nAnother opportunity we have is to take this moment and to talk about wellbeing and researching well be another thread I consider as the questions about what's worth funding and one of the earliest people to die in this war was a part of beyond furnership ecosystem in Palestine, a part of one of the organizations we were training.\n\nMaybe we name this project after this person, and we say something about how important and necessary it is to not play the game that causes for the so winners take off, you know?\n\nOh yeah a different game.\n\nAnd what is that game?\n\nWhere winners don't take all.\n\nOoh.\n\nAnd the problem with the winners is that the winners are the murderers.\n\nSo it's like winners take off, but not only that only is that bad enough.\n\nIt's murderers take all the people that have caused the death of our training partner in Palestine are the ones in esshen's funding a war how can we take money to enrich this group, and the good thing is the work with the autori foundation is a little different.\n\nThe group that is funding well study project and working in this region is from the region itself, and they're giving back the challenge is that their funding actually also comes from oil money and it's better to be taking oil money to be using it to contribute to a region where oil has been a part of the problem for so long because it causes this region to be an area of interest for extractive forces, and this is all not very pleasant or beautiful things to say, especially not to the funders.\n\nAnd so the question we're having on this run right now is, what can we say that it is motivating the people on the ground who are afraid who are experiencing bombings.\n\nCan we really tell them let's go and build businesses in this globalized world where people talk about a globalized world.\n\nThey don't often remember that they also sort of imply the globe is western hegemony and the people that are a part of this globalization movement are those that either except or or a part of the empire.\n\nI think it would be great to have historians on the team.\n\nHistorian advisers, which were, perhaps, he really intense. And maybe it's good to be intense.\n\nMaybe it's uh time to see enough with the half measures.\n\nAlthough half measures are the ones that get us any measure, we want to not be revolutionary, even, and especially because there are wonderful people in this ecosystem, people that care and perhaps just don't see and don't know and don't have a way to be other. And so just like there's the way of seeing with two eyes, the reality of the presence of God in all things, and the reality of the transcendence of God far beyond anything perhaps in the same way we can see the actions we need to take as the solution, even if the solution is a qualitative reinterpretation of self value, power, creativity, agency on furnship, we don't need to convince people of these things and of the fact that the world needs different ways of even transacting and creating and giving and receiving value beyond the dollar, because if we own we say that it's necessary for this project and for any project that wants to do good and contribute to the region that it must understand the or say not misunderense, take on a new pair of eyes that sees humanity the humanity of the participants, their fullness, and for the teams themselves to also understand the fact that it might be better to return to systems of farming and support and what might seem like a small scale success versus building an AI powered education platform for refugees that does someladibas.\n\nNot that that that's a bad idea.\n\nThere can be something to these things, but I do believe that there needs to be a different thing as well that there needs to be a realization that it's not all just random how has this been here for so long?\n\nIt's not all just random that, you know America has the highest rates of depression and prescriptions of antidepressants, and the highest rates of wealth in today's terms, the idea of dollars or GDP or these kinds of measures, and that we need new measures and that there's people working on these new measures of the eight forms of capital and various measures like this that include spiritual capital and intellectual capital and realize that the hyper optimization on one parameter and especially when that one parameter is a dollar that has a power structure embedded in it.\n\nBecause of the way that the petro dollar works because of the way certain wars have been fought in the name of preserving and protecting the global reserve currency, and there might be an important and valuable element to a globally traded and trusted currency and if that globally traded and trusted currency had with it different sets of ways of insuring that trust for instance, perhaps it can have some inherent value within it, for instance, can be used for something that generally people believe is valuable and the idea of creating a world that has a currency that has more than a globally dominant, aggressive superpower behind it, a currency that has the future as a part of it, for instance, copper is needed for the energy transition, and the energy transition seems to be a foundational part of our ability to be transacting internationally in the future, certainly there is local economic economics, even barger and trade.\n\nThey can work or a local environment.\n\nBut if we wanted to go abroad, the idea of using a value of item like copper silver uneven gold could be an important part of the element of trust that goes beyond just violence, although there must be some international law that causes people to trust the demarcation of transaction, for instance.\n\nCopper doesn't have to move unless it means to move to where it needs use.\n\nSo for instance, perhaps the copper needs to go from the mine to a factory that will be making wires or batteries.\n\nThat transaction can be facilitated through. Nice.\n\nCool.\n\nFinally.\n\nThat transaction can be facilitated through the dollar, not the dollar.\n\nThat transaction can be facilitated through some kind of cryptomechanism or different mechanism that has this ability to designate and transfer ownership, and at the same time, that transaction can be a uh a a movement through space from the people that have minded to the people that need it or wanted.\n\nAnd so it's kind of interesting to see that there is a potentially uh and now like a situation to Bitcoin itself or this idea of like mining and an ownership and and all of that, uh with the new kind of way that we're describing owning copper, that you actually mine it gets onto a ledger or a block chain, and that that ledger a blockchain is the thing that winds up um demonstrating ownership and and someone can own the uh the current the the copper inside the batteries?\n\nIs that even possible?\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nAnd that's a good question. And uh yeah, so this uh this idea is just an idea, something to think about. Um and what I would like to do, though, is to, you know, raise these Christians about what is value?\n\nHow do we how do we have trusted ownership of value as value is created through work through you know, there's two kinds of value.\n\nThere's the mining of the blockchain and the mining of the copper itself.\n\nSo the mining of the copper can be paired with the mining of the block chain, so we can do that by when copper is produced and the rate of production is clearly defined and somehow proven by a factory. We can have matching serial numbers. Gold bars usually have serial numbers, right?\n\nSo potentially it could be interesting to have the serial numbers be paired by writing it into the blockchain, and it's kind of interesting to see.\n\nYou'd be able to see where does my where did the copper?\n\nThat was mine go and can even connect to recycling.\n\nIt's not so straightforward as a if you not as the dinard is a den not.\n\nBut there's something similar to how trusted the not in the past were able to move through trusted individuals and paper, saying, okay, there's a bunch of denod over there that are held in banks and are with trusted parties, and so I would like to pay you these paper deods over here, representing those Dod over there.\n\nAnd can we do that with the idea that we're describing right now, where the copper is mine and matched with a mind block in a block chain perhaps an ingot or some other standard unit of weight. And then when a party requires that copper, the value is is changing, right?\n\nSo at the mind, the copper is worth X amount.\n\nSo maybe it doesn't even matter after that.\n\nMaybe we know we need for the energy transition millions of meters of X-gauge wire, and maybe the hey, the connection, uh-oh, uh-oh can be through uh a forgot my key. Open the door.\n\nI just took the uh fisky.\n\nOkay..\n\nThe peg can be through uh the uh what is it meters.\n\nAnd so once that production is done, the possibility of okay no way . Got to close it, huh?\n\n“””",

      "content": "**Essay: A Meditation on Value, Economics, and Change**\n\nToday’s reflections are an intricate stream of thought, weaving together personal experiences, philosophical inquiries, and economic critiques. The journey begins with the tactile simplicity of a chilly run in the woods, where the natural world frames complex musings about systemic challenges and potential solutions. At the heart of these reflections is a deep questioning of value—what it means, how it is created, and how it can be trusted and transacted ethically in a world rife with inequity.\n\n### The Personal and the Global: A Juxtaposition\nThe narrative opens with a run in the citadel, setting a scene of physical activity and introspection. The cold invigorates, and a black squirrel serves as a moment of pause—a symbol of life amidst stillness. These personal moments anchor broader reflections on entrepreneurship, well-being, and the ecosystem of support needed for meaningful innovation. The author’s musings move fluidly between their immediate environment and larger systemic issues, suggesting a deep interconnectedness between the personal and the global.\n\n### A Critique of \"Winners Take All\"\nA poignant critique emerges of the global economic system, particularly the “winners take all” mentality",
