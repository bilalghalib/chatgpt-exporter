To find patchouli farms in that area, I would recommend:\n\n1. Doing an online search for \"patchouli farms\" or \"patchouli suppliers\" near Mexico City\n2. Contacting local agricultural organizations or herb/essential oil associations in Mexico for leads\n3. Checking with botanical gardens or universities in the Mexico City area that may have information on local herb cultivation\n4. Asking at natural product stores or aromatherapy shops in Mexico City if they source patchouli locally\n\nWould you like any general information about patchouli cultivation that might be helpful for your search?",
