  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user requested a comprehensive review and strategic overhaul of their solar training program materials for Iraq, specifically for training electrical engineers in Mosul to become solar professionals. They provided multiple documents including a 167-slide presentation, facilitator guides, interview transcripts with practitioners, and Excel workbooks. The user emphasized they are Iraqi themselves and requested removal of cultural sensitivity content since both trainers and participants share the same background.\n\nThe user wanted to create a unified Training of Trainers (ToT) program with consistent structure between facilitator guides and speaker notes, consolidate redundant content, and develop HTML slide templates for missing critical components. They specifically requested a strategic analysis followed by a master introduction, consolidated overview guide, and detailed Day 1 facilitator guide before proceeding with Days 2-5.\n\nClaude conducted a comprehensive analysis identifying strengths like the Learn-Apply-Sell rhythm and real case studies (Ahmed's Cafe, Zahra's Workshop), while noting gaps including slide deck bloat, missing technical slides for wire sizing and wind loads, and inconsistent facilitator guide structure. The response included a complete strategic plan with unified document architecture, a master program introduction highlighting Iraq's energy economics (generator costs of 380-450 IQD/kWh vs solar at 150 IQD/kWh), and a detailed Day 1 facilitator guide.\n\nThe deliverables featured a 5-hour daily structure with specific timing, hands-on component stations, Excel integration points, speaker notes in Arabic and English, and HTML templates for new slides including homework cards, component station maps, cost comparison visuals, and professional installation timelines. The approach emphasized practical learning over theory with a 70/30 hands-on ratio, real pricing scenarios, and immediate application to local market conditions including Mosul's extreme heat and infrastructure challenges.",

This is a 6-day, 70 % hands-on solar training. We start right now by meeting each other.”\n\nIce Breakers - What brings you here?\nFacilitator notes:\nFacilitator:\u000b “Alright, everyone—let’s learn each other’s names and why we’re here today. We’re doing a sticky-note mingle.”\nStep 1: Write (30 s)\u000b “I’m going to pass out one coloured sticky-note and a pen to each of you. On your sticky, write one single word that best answers ‘Why I joined this solar training.’\nIt could be ‘energy’, ‘income’, ‘safety’, ‘future’, anything!\nKeep it short—just one word.”\n(Trainer walks around handing out sticky-notes and pens.)\n“Ready? Go—30 seconds!”\n(After ~30 s, trainer raises hand.)\u000b “Time!”\nStep 2: Mingle & Introduce (1 min 30 s)\u000b “Now, stand up, and find someone you don’t know. Swap sticky-notes: read their word and introduce your partner to your table in a quick 10-second popcorn burst.”\nPopcorn rule: when you’re ready, just call out someone’s name and toss them the “popcorn” to speak.\nExample pop: “Pop! John, tell us your word and why.”\n“Go! Mingle for 90 seconds.”\n(Trainer circulates, encourages quick popcorn calls at tables: “Pop! Aisha?” “Pop! Mahmoud?”)\nStep 3: Share & Sit (30 s)\u000b (After ~1 min 30 s, trainer claps hands.)\u000b “Awesome—have a seat! Let’s do quick popcorn on one word per table.”\nTrainer points to Table 1: “Pop! Table 1, who’s first?”\nA participant shares: “My word is………..”\nTrainer thanks them, then moves on: “Pop! Table 2?”\n“Great—now we know names and why we’re here. Let’s move on to our financial check-in.”\n\nGenerator Frustration → Solar Solution\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n✅ صباح الخير everyone! Before we start, let me ask - who here pays more than 150,000 IQD monthly for generator fuel? [Count hands]\n\nNow, who wants to cut that by 80%?

This is our Pre-Training Financial-Literacy Assessment, and it’s diagnostic only—no grades, no pressure.”\u000b\nExplain purpose (30 s):\u000b “The questions cover payback calculations, cost comparisons, cash-flow timing, and basic profit metrics. Your honest answers help me tailor the week to your needs.”\u000b\nHow to complete (30 s):\u000b “Please open your phone’s camera or scanning app and point it at the big QR code. If you can’t scan, type the URL shown below into your browser. Once the form loads, tap the Pre-Test box at the top.”\u000b\nTiming & support (20 s):\u000b “You have 15 minutes to finish. I’ll walk around to help with any tech issues or provide a paper copy if your internet is unstable.”\u000b\nEncouragement & confidentiality (20 s):\u000b “Remember, this is just for you and for me to understand where we start. No one sees your individual scores—only aggregate results guide our sessions. Ready? Let’s begin.”\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nBefore we dive into today’s content, I want to show you the heartbeat of our entire training: the 3-Block Rhythm.\n📘 LEARN (First Block)\nWhat it is: A focused theory segment where we introduce concepts, review real data, and demo key techniques.\nWhy it matters: This gives you the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind every tool and calculation you’ll use.\nHow long: Roughly 45–60 minutes each morning.\n“In this block, feel free to ask questions—that’s exactly what it’s for.”\u000b\n🛠️ APPLY (Second Block)\nWhat it is: Hands-on practice. You’ll work in small teams at stations or on rigs, putting theory into action.\nWhy it matters: Muscle memory and real-world troubleshooting live here.\nHow long: 60–90 minutes, with a built-in rotation so you touch every station.\n“Here’s where mistakes are your best teachers—don’t be shy to try, fail fast, and ask for help.”\u000b\n💼 SELL (Third Block)\nWhat it is: A quick pitch, reflection, or mini-task where you frame what you’ve learned in a customer context: ROI pitches, service designs, troubleshooting reports.\nWhy it matters: Our end users—and many of your future clients—care about the numbers and the story.\nHow long: 30–45 minutes, wrapping up each day on a high-energy note.\n“This final block trains you to translate skills into value—and gives us a fun way to celebrate progress each day!”\u000b\nTransition Script:\u000b “Every day, we’ll follow this rhythm: Learn new theory, Apply it in the field, then Sell it back as a solution. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle—and you’ll use it in your design-competition finale. Ready to see it in action? Let’s switch to all of each day block rhythm”\n\n\n[EXCEL CALLOUT]\n📊 EXCEL MOMENT #1:\nOpen Tab 1: Ahmed's Cafe\nEnter load data in cells B5-B12\nWatch monthly cost auto-calculate!\n\n5\n\nDay 1-5 and Day 6 The Design Competition\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nLearn\nApply\nSell\nDay 1\nIntro to PV fundamentals \nComponent stations tour\nPanel & inverter hands-on\nLoad-audit workshop\n1-min ROI pitch video\nDay 2\nDeep dive: fuses & BMS\nDatasheet scavenger hunt\nWire-bench & breaker test\nBattery temp-log\nWarranty red-flag exercise\nDay 3\nCable sizing & torque logic\nFrame & wind loads\n4-panel roof-rig build\nDust-loss demo\nCleaning service pricing\nDay 4\nPVsyst simulation basics\nGrowth & shade analysis\nRoof plan editing\nCash-flow builder\nExpansion & service pitch\nDay 5\nTroubleshoot common faults\nFinal design sprint\nFault-hunt on mini-rig\nROI & margin wrap-up\nFinal 5-min pitch\nOptional Day 6\nDesign competition preparation\nDesign competition build-out\nWinner announcements\nFacilitator notes:\n“This is your roadmap for the week. Each day you’ll learn core theory, apply it hands-on, then sell your solution back to the class. Notice how the rhythm repeats—by Day 6 you’ll have integrated everything into a final design competition.”\n\nDay 1 Learning Objectives\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nLearn\nIdentify & handle real PV components\nRead key datasheet specs (Voc, Isc, temp-coef)\nApply\nCalculate household load in amps → kWh\nApply safety lock-out & DC rules\nSell\nCompare cost: generator vs solar (ROI)\nReflect & improve with daily feedback wall\nFacilitator notes:\n“Here are the six objectives for Day 1. The first two are Learn: by mid-morning you’ll be able to identify every PV component on the table and interpret Voc, Isc, and temperature coefficients from a datasheet.\nThen in Apply, you’ll calculate a real family’s load in amps and kilowatt-hours—and practice our zero-injury lock-out pledge on actual panels.\nFinally, in Sell, you’ll use those numbers to compare generator vs solar ROI and record a quick 1-minute pitch.\nFeel free to refer back to these as we go—each objective aligns to our Learn-Apply-Sell rhythm.”\n\nSafety First\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nGoal: 0 accidents all week\n(Share Ali’s story) \n⚠️ Isolate circuit — lock-out tag & padlock\n⚠️ Verify zero volts (DC first) with multimeter\n⚠️ Wear gloves & safety glasses\n⚠️ When work in electricity combine another person with you.\n⚠️ Use isolated tools while working in electricity.\n⚠️ One person shouts \"CLEAR!\" before reconnect\n⚠️ Never touch a live DC string\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nOpening Hook (30 s):\n“Before we jump in, I want to remind everyone why safety is non-negotiable. Last month, our colleague Ali got an accident with electricity because [the detailed story to be confirmed].”\n[Show a brief photo if available]\nLesson from Ali’s Story (45 s):\n“Ali admitted later that he needs to pay attention to [the detailed mistake to be confirmed].”\n“We don’t want ‘it always works’—we want zero incidents.”\nStep-by-Step Safety Ritual (1 min):\nIsolate: “First, open the breaker and hang the lock-out tag and padlock. That tag must read your name and time.”\nTest for Zero Volts: “Always grab your multimeter, set it to DC volts, and verify zero at both panel junction and inverter input.”\nPPE On: “Gloves and safety glasses stay on from start to finish—no exceptions.”\nBuddy System: “Never work alone. Your partner watches your back, hands you tools, and calls out if they see anything unsafe.”\nInsulated Tools: “Only use insulated screwdrivers, pliers, and cutters. Ordinary tools can turn into conductors.”\n“CLEAR!” Confirmation: “Before reconnecting, one person must shout ‘CLEAR!’ and everyone else must acknowledge. Only then do you switch the breaker back on.”\nHands Off Live DC: “Under no circumstances touch a live DC conductor. If you find voltage present, repeat steps 1–3.”\u000b\nReinforce & Model (45 s):\n“Let’s demo right now. Volunteer with me: please come lock out this breaker.”\n[Walk through the lock-out/tag-out procedure slowly, narrating each step: writing tag, locking padlock, testing multimeter, buddy confirmation, shout ‘CLEAR!’]\n“See how deliberate we are? This ritual is your daily habit—every single morning, before any hands-on work.”\u000b\nTransition to Next Topic (15 s): “Okay, with zero-injury top of mind, we’re ready to explore why Iraq’s energy mix drives us to solar. Let’s move on to how generators, grid, and sunshine fit into our story.”\n\n\n[EXCEL CALLOUT]\n📊 EXCEL MOMENT #2:\nOpen Tab 2: Cost Comparison\nAdjust system size in C3\nSee 10-year savings graph update!\n\n\nGrid 8-12 h, 100-160 IQD/kWh  \nGenerator 380-450 IQD/kWh  \nSolar ≈150 IQD/kWh)\nIraq Energy Reality\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n“Before we talk components, let’s ground ourselves in why we’re here: energy in Iraq.”\nDiesel Generators (30 s)\n“Right now, most homes and shops run on diesel generators.”\n“They cost 380 to 450 IQD per kilowatt-hour—that’s money straight out of your pocket. And they fill our air with smoke we all breathe.”\nQuick check-in: “By show of hands, who here has heard their generator run for more than 12 hours in one day?” (Pause for a few raised hands.)\nNational Grid (20 s)\n“The grid is cheaper—100 to 160 IQD/kWh—but only delivers power 8–12 hours a day, and the voltage wobbles so lights flicker and devices burn out.

Think of these as your solar-survival kit.”\nVoc (Open-circuit voltage):\u000b “This is the maximum voltage your panel can spit out when nothing’s hooked up. It’s critical because your inverter has a voltage ceiling—stay below it or you risk damage.”\nIsc (Short-circuit current):\u000b “This is the peak current if you directly short the panel leads. We never actually do that—except in testing—but it tells us how big of a fuse and cable we need to keep everything safe.”\nTemp-coef (Temperature coefficient):\u000b “Panels lose power as they heat up. A typical value is –0.35 % per °C, so on a 60 °C roof you might be 7 % down just from heat. In Mosul, that adds up fast—always factor it in.”\nAzimuth (East/West offset):\u000b “Azimuth tells us which way the panels face: 0° is true south, –90° is east, +90° is west. Even a 15° error can cost you a few percent of annual energy.”\nTilt (β):\u000b “That’s the angle from horizontal—think of it like tilting your panel to chase the sun. At our latitude we use around 30°, but small tweaks bump up winter versus summer yield.”\nPeak-Sun-Hour:\u000b “This compresses sun intensity into ‘hours of full sun per day.’ If Mosul averages 5 kWh/m²/day, one kWp of panels makes about 5 kWh each day.”\nkWh ↔ Amp conversion:\u000b “To turn a device’s current draw into energy: Amps × Volts × Hours ÷ 1000 = kWh.

Setup reminder (30 s):\n“Okay everyone, please take the printed datasheet at your table—one for the premium Longi panel, one for the low-quality panel. You’ll need pens.”\n\n2. Explain the task (30 s):\n“On each sheet you’ll find a sea of numbers. Our goal in the field is to spot three key specs in under a minute. Today those are:\n  • Voc: the panel’s open-circuit voltage (think of it as the “pressure” it can build when nothing’s attached).\n  • Isc: the short-circuit current (the maximum “flow” if you directly connect the leads).\n  • Temp-coef: how much power changes with temperature (for example, –0.35 % per °C, so panels lose a bit of output when they get hot).”\n\n3. Analogy (30 s):\n“Imagine Voc is like the highest pressure in a water hose when the nozzle is closed. Isc is the flood of water if you remove the nozzle completely. Temp-coef is how much that water flow drops when the hose gets hot in the sun.”\n\n4. Countdown & roam (30 s + 1 min):\n“Ready?

Solar panels work best when sunlight hits them directly. Optimal tilt depends on location and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is 32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best orientation.\nFacilitator notes:\u000b “Okay, team—let’s talk about tilt and azimuth.\n‘Tilt’ is just how much you tip your panel up from flat ground. If it’s too flat, you miss low-angle winter sun; too steep, you lose high summer sun. In Mosul we aim for 32 to 36 degrees—that balance gives us the most energy year-round.\n‘Azimuth’ means the compass direction the panel faces. 0 degrees is true south, which gets the highest sun all day. A few degrees east or west are okay, but aim as close to south as you can.\n\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other structures can block sunlight from reaching solar panels. Even partial shading significantly reduces power output, as the entire string performance drops to that of the shaded panel. To maximize energy production year-round, it's important to avoid shaded spots when installing solar panels.\nFacilitator notes:\u000b “Next up: shading. This is a solar killer.\nAny time a bit of your panel is shaded, the whole string of panels drops in power—like a traffic jam on your roof.\nSee that tree branch on the right? That tiny stripe of shade can cost you 20 to 30 percent of your daily energy.\n\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\nWhat is the peak load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\nWhat is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\nHow many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries without other input sources?)\nIs there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\nWhat is the layout of the roof? Include equipment, shading obstacles, or barriers affecting solar installation.\nWhat is the direction of true south?\nWhat are the building’s operating hours?\nHow many days per week is the building operational?\nWhat type of building is it? (Residential, commercial, or industrial)\nAre there any shading risks? (e.g., trees or nearby buildings)\nAny additional information?\nFacilitator notes: \n\u000b “Here’s your Field Survey Checklist—twelve key questions you always ask on any new rooftop. Today, we’ll practice using it.\nActivity Instructions:\nI need you in your teams to choose one nearby roof—your house, or the building next door.\nTake five minutes to answer the first six questions on the left in jot-form on a sticky note:\nPeak and average amps, future growth, grid availability, system type, and battery autonomy.\nAlso note any shading obstacles you spot—trees, pipes, walls.\u000b\nGo!

Under-torque and the next big gust will loosen your rails, risking misalignment and damage.\nHands-on tip: When you hear that “click,” stop turning—over-torque can strip threads.

A drilled hole and raw bolt aren’t enough in concrete—dust, heat, and vibration degrade simple expansion anchors. Instead, follow these four steps:\nDrill a 12 mm hole and blow out any dust.\nInject epoxy-based chemical anchor, filling the hole.\nInsert the threaded rod and leave it to cure for 24 hours.\nTighten the nut to 25 Nm—this torque drives resin into every crevice.\u000b\nFinally: Extra Wind-Load Notes.\nApply sealant tape along the rail slots to protect against dust infiltration and corrosion.\nOn the windward edge, use edge clamps or anti-uplift brackets to boost your pull-out resistance by an additional 20 %.\nNow, look at these real-world failure examples:\nPhoto A: anchor cured in dusty hole—notice the crack around the mount where the bond failed.\nPhoto B: panels bowed outwards because no expansion gap let them press against each other under heat.\nPhoto C: rusty slot-clips—dust trapped moisture and ate through the aluminum.\u000b\nActivity prompt (30 s):\u000b “Before we move on, turn to your neighbor and name one step of the chemical anchor process you’ve never done before. Go!”\n[After 30 s pair-share]\n“Great—let’s carry these mounting best practices into Station 1 of our Apply block, where you’ll assemble and torque the rails on a mock roof section with proper gaps and anchors.”\n\nDC Connection Perfection\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nStep 1\nStrip Cable\n(8 mm insulation)\nStep 2\nInsert Pin\n(fully home)\n*Photo A: cleanly stripped PV cable\n*Photo B: pin inserted to shoulder\nStep 3\nCrimp\n(18 Nm torque)\nStep 4\nPull-Test\n(≥ 150 N retention)\n*Photo C: crimper on pin, listen for “click”\n*Photo D: pull-tester reading ≥ 150 N\nFacilitator notes:\n[After reviewing mounting, trainer transitions:]\u000b “Before you head to the MC4 crimp stations, let’s lock down the perfect DC-connection ritual—because a bad crimp is more than a loose wire, it’s a fire hazard. In fact, up to 80 percent of rooftop fires start right here at the connectors.\nStep 1: Strip Cable\nGoal: expose exactly 8 mm of bare conductor. Too little and your pin won’t seat; too much and strands get nicked.\nTip: use the dedicated PV cable stripper’s stop gauge. You should see every strand intact.\u000b\nStep 2: Insert Pin\nGoal: slide the MC4 pin fully onto the exposed conductor until it locks at the shoulder.\nCheck: the gold-plated shoulder should be flush with the insulation’s edge. No copper should peek out.\u000b\nStep 3: Crimp\nGoal: use your ratchet crimper set to 18 Nm.\nListen: the “click” tells you you’ve hit the target torque—stop immediately to avoid over-crimping.\u000b\nStep 4: Pull-Test\nGoal: verify a retention force of at least 150 Newtons (about 15 kgf).\nProcedure: clamp the connector in the pull-tester jaws and steadily pull until you see the reading. Anything under 150 N means re-crimp.\u000b\nMini Activity (1 min):\u000b “Turn to your neighbor and quiz them: ‘What’s the one audible cue you listen for during crimping?’\u000b Go!”\n[30 s pair-share]\n“Exactly—the ratchet click.

Let’s go!”\n\nHaykal Mounting Frame – Key Checks\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nKit frame (bolt-together) vs welded steel  \nTorque spec 18 Nm \nMust resist wind-load ≥ 1.5 kN/m² on Mosul roofs\nFacilitator notes:\nFrame Options (45 s)\u000b “On the left you see the bolt-together kit—quick to assemble with basic tools—and on the right a fully welded steel bracket. The kit is fastest on site; the welded frame can be stronger but costs more in labour.”\u000b\nTorque Spec (30 s)\u000b “Every M8 bolt must be tightened to 18 Nm—just like on your MC4 and rail-mount tasks. Under-torque risks loosening; over-torque can strip threads.”\u000b\nWind-Load Calculation (60 s)\u000b “Mosul’s design wind pressure is 1.5 kN/m², which translates to about 150 kgf per m² of panel area: \nF = Pressure × Area  \nF = 1 500 N/m² × 1 m² ≈ 1 500 N ≈ 150 kgf  \nThat’s why we limit rail spans to 1.5 m—to keep bending loads within safe limits—and why in Tab 3 of your workbook you’ll price extra brackets or gussets so your kit stays solid in a storm.”\u000b\nTransition to Apply (30 s)\u000b “Now let’s head to our framing station, where you’ll practice bolting the kit rails to a mock roof section, torque them to 18 Nm, and sketch where extra brackets go. Grab your torque wrench and Workbook Tab 3—let’s go!”\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nRooftop Hazards & PPE\n🪜 Ladder at 75°: “Set ladder at a 75° angle for stability.”\n\n🪢 Harness & Anchor: “Always wear a fall-arrest harness clipped to a certified anchor.”\n\n🥽🧤 Gloves & Goggles: “Insulated gloves and safety glasses on at all times.”\nFacilitator notes:\n“Okay team, before we climb any more roofs, let’s run through our rooftop safety essentials.”\n1. Ladder Angle (30 s)\u000b “First, the ladder. You see the 75° icon—why 75°? Too shallow and it slips out; too steep and it tips backward. To find 75°, stand with your toes at the ladder base, reach your arms straight out: your palms should just touch a rung. Practice that every time you set up.”\n2. Harness & Anchor (45 s)\u000b “Next, fall protection. Every one of you must wear a harness clipped to a certified anchor point. No exceptions. If you’re more than one step onto the roof, hook in before moving. The anchor must be rated for at least 5 kN—always inspect the hardware before use.”\n3. Insulated Gloves & Safety Glasses (30 s)\u000b “Finally, PPE. Even if you’re just tightening a bolt, insulated gloves protect you from unexpected live wires or sharp edges. Safety glasses shield your eyes from dust, flying debris, or cable snap-backs. Keep them on from the moment you step onto the roof.”\nQuick Check (15 s)\u000b “Popcorn style—shout out one rooftop hazard we haven’t covered yet!”\u000b (Wait for a response, e.g., hot surfaces, sun exposure.)\nTransition (10 s)\u000b “Great—keep these rules top of mind all day. Next up, we’ll move into our wind-load and torque block, where we’ll practice safe bolt-torquing on a mock frame.”\n\nFuse & Ground Rules\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nFuse on positive DC as close to battery as possible\nUse DC-rated breakers for combiner if > 4 strings\nGrounding and lightning rod ≥ 2 m, copper-clad 16 mm Ø. Target ≤ 5 Ω earth resistance (demo showed 12 Ω acceptable only for class)\nTest resistance ≤ 5 Ω (goal)\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s cover two non-negotiables in every hybrid PV system: DC fusing and earthing.”\n1) Battery-Positive Fuse (45 s):\u000b “Always install the first fuse on the positive DC cable right at the battery’s terminal. Why? If a short happens anywhere in the wiring, that fuse blows instantly and protects every meter of cable, every combiner box, and your inverter. No fuse here means your cable could catch fire or your battery pack could go into thermal runaway.”\n2) DC-Rated Breakers at Combiners (30 s):\u000b “When you have more than four panel strings feeding a combiner, swap the standard fuse for a DC-rated miniature breaker. DC arcs don’t self-extinguish as fast as AC arcs—so you need a breaker designed for DC interruption. Always check the label: it should say ‘DC’ or ‘PV use.’”\n3) Ground Rod Specs (30 s):\u000b “For your earth electrode, drive at least 2 meters of 16 mm-diameter copper-clad steel into the ground, as shown here. Copper-clad offers corrosion resistance, so your rod stays conductive for years.”\n4) Earth Resistance Target (30 s):\u000b “After driving the rod, measure ground-to-rod resistance. In class we saw 12 Ω, which is fine for a demo. But on a real rooftop or field installation, we aim for ≤ 5 Ω. Why? Lightning and surge currents will always seek the path of least resistance—so you want it going into the earth rod, not through your inverter or structure.”\nTransition to Demo (15 s):\u000b “Now that we understand the why and how, let’s head out and test our demo rod to see that 12 Ω reading in action.”\n\nIraqi Grounding Solution\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n4-Step Chemical Enhancement Process\nPre-Drill & Clean\nDrill hole to 1 m depth, remove loose soil.\nPack Enhancement Compound\nPour in specialized conductive powder (sachet shown).\nBackfill & Hydrate\nRefill with original soil + 2 L of water per 0.5 kg compound.\nMeasure & Verify\nRetest; repeat hydration every 3 months if > 5 Ω.\nGoal: ≤ 5 Ω for safe lightning & fault clearance\nFacilitator notes:\n[After covering fuse & rod specs:]\u000b “In Mosul’s dry, compacted soils, you often see resistivity above 1 000 Ω·m—that’s why a plain copper rod alone can measure 12–15 Ω, not the < 5 Ω we need for reliable fault-clearing.\nStep 1: Pre-Drill & Clean\nWe start by drilling a full 1 m hole. Remove any loose dirt or rock so our compound makes intimate contact with surrounding earth.\u000b\nStep 2: Pack Enhancement Compound\nHere’s our GroundPro™ sachet—a mix of bentonite clay and conductive salts. Pour the entire 0.5 kg pack around the rod.\u000b\nStep 3: Backfill & Hydrate\nRefill the hole with original soil, then pour in 2 L of clean water. The water activates the clay’s swelling and forms a low-resistance zone around the rod.\u000b\nStep 4: Measure & Verify\nAfter waiting 30 minutes for settling, clamp your earth tester and measure. If you’re still above 5 Ω, hydrate again or add a second sachet. We also re-hydrate every 3 – 6 months to maintain performance.\u000b\nMini Q&A (30 s):\u000b “Why do we use both clay and salts instead of just pouring water?”\u000b – Expected answer: “Clay holds moisture; salts improve conductivity.”\n“Exactly—that combo keeps the soil conductive, even in our hottest summers.\nTransition to Demo:\u000b “Next, we’ll drive our demonstration rod, pack a sachet, hydrate, and see how we drop from 12 Ω down to under 5 Ω live. Gloves on—let’s go!”\n\nEarthing Rod Mini-Demo\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nHammer 1 m rod  \nConnect tester – read Ω value on screen\nFacilitator notes:\n“Time for live verification—let’s test our earthing rod.”\n1) Safety First (15 s):\u000b “Before anyone swings, helmet, gloves, and work boots on. Check that no one is standing within the hammer’s arc.”\n2) Hammering the Rod (30 s):\u000b “Trainee, please drive that 1 m rod straight down until only about 10 cm protrudes. Keep it vertical—any tilt reduces contact area with the earth.”\n3) Connecting the Meter (30 s):\u000b “Now, clip one multimeter lead to the top of the rod clamp and the other to our reference stake. Set the meter to the ohms range.”\n4) Reading & Context (30 s):\u000b “We’re seeing 12 Ω. Remember, for a real rooftop you want ≤ 5 Ω—so you’d add water to the soil or drive a second rod nearby to lower the resistance.”\n5) Quick Q&A (15 s):\u000b “Why do you think soil moisture matters? … Exactly: water improves conductivity between the rod and surrounding earth.”\n6) Wrap-up & Transition (15 s):\u000b “Great work—now that you’ve seen how to measure earth resistance.”\n\nPreview → Workbook Tab 3 Mounting BOM & Cleaning ROI\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nFacilitator notes:\n“Next, you’ll see exactly how those torque specs and wind-load limits feed into our cost models.

When you hear it, you’re done. If you over- or under-torque, you fail that bolt check.”\n“For dust, your solar-tester is on ISC mode—press and hold, note the number. Keep all readings on your sticky-note log so you can transfer them to Tab 3 later.”\n“For shading, point your protractor at the panel edge, note the angle, then sweep the lamp until you hit peak current.”\u000b\nSafety & teamwork (30 s):\n“Remember PPE: gloves and glasses on at all times. Don’t climb on the rig—panels stay on the table. Work in pairs: one ‘installer,’ one ‘recorder.’ Swap roles at the halfway whistle.”\n“We’ll keep a whiteboard leaderboard for fastest safe build, biggest % dust-loss, and most precise tilt/azimuth—winners get cookies at break.”\u000b\nLogging (15 s):\n“At the end of each rotation, open your workbook to Tab 3 (‘Roof-Rig Data’) and enter:\u000b • your torque time (how long to torque all bolts),\u000b • dust loss % (dirty vs clean),\u000b • optimal tilt & azimuth (degrees).\n“We’ll reconvene after three rotations and compare results.”\n“Station 1 ready?

For example, you might say ‘accuracy,’ or ‘confidence,’ or ‘forecasting.’ Keep it to one word.”\u000b\nPopcorn Mechanics (15 s)\u000b “We’re using popcorn style: when you have your word, just say ‘Pop!’ and then share it. No need to wait for me to call on you—jump in as soon as you’re ready.”\u000b\nEncourage Participation (10 s)\u000b “Aim to hear from as many people as possible in two minutes. It’s fast and fun—let’s get started!”\u000b\u000b\nFacilitate (1 min 15 s)\nListen for volunteers.\nIf it slows, prompt: “Pop! Who’s next?”\nRepeat back a few words to reinforce: “I hear ‘optimization,’ ‘confidence,’ ‘accuracy’—great goals!”\u000b\nClose (10 s)\u000b “Fantastic—thanks for sharing your hopes. We’ll keep those words in mind as we dive into daily 3-Block Rhythm.”\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 4\nFacilitator notes:\nJust like Day 3, this three-block rhythm is the heartbeat of every training day:\n📘 LEARN (First Block)\nWhat it is: A focused theory segment where we introduce concepts, review real data, and demo key techniques.\nWhy it matters: This gives you the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind every tool and calculation you’ll use.\nHow long: Roughly 45–60 minutes each morning.\n“In this block, feel free to ask questions—that’s exactly what it’s for.”\u000b\n🛠️ APPLY (Second Block)\nWhat it is: Hands-on practice. You’ll work in small teams at stations or on rigs, putting theory into action.\nWhy it matters: Muscle memory and real-world troubleshooting live here.\nHow long: 60–90 minutes, with a built-in rotation so you touch every station.\n“Here’s where mistakes are your best teachers—don’t be shy to try, fail fast, and ask for help.”\u000b\n💼 SELL (Third Block)\nWhat it is: A quick pitch, reflection, or mini-task where you frame what you’ve learned in a customer context: ROI pitches, service designs, troubleshooting reports.\nWhy it matters: Our end users—and many of your future clients—care about the numbers and the story.\nHow long: 30–45 minutes, wrapping up each day on a high-energy note.\n“This final block trains you to translate skills into value—and gives us a fun way to celebrate progress each day!”\u000b\nTransition Script:\u000b “Every day, we’ll follow this rhythm: Learn new theory, Apply it in the field, then Sell it back as a solution. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle—and you’ll use it in your design-competition finale. Ready to see it in action? Let’s switch to all of each day block rhythm”\n105\n\nDay 1-5 and Day 6 The Design Competition\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\nLearn\nApply\nSell\nDay 1\nIntro to PV fundamentals \nComponent stations tour\nPanel & inverter hands-on\nLoad-audit workshop\n1-min ROI pitch video\nDay 2\nDeep dive: fuses & BMS\nDatasheet scavenger hunt\nWire-bench & breaker test\nBattery temp-log\nWarranty red-flag exercise\nDay 3\nCable sizing & torque logic\nFrame & wind loads\n4-panel roof-rig build\nDust-loss demo\nCleaning service pricing\nDay 4\nPVsyst simulation basics\nGrowth & shade analysis\nRoof plan editing\nCash-flow builder\nExpansion & service pitch\nDay 5\nTroubleshoot common faults\nFinal design sprint\nFault-hunt on mini-rig\nROI & margin wrap-up\nFinal 5-min pitch\nOptional Day 6\nDesign competition preparation\nDesign competition build-out\nWinner announcements\nFacilitator notes:\n“Again, just like yesterday, this is your roadmap for the week. Each day you’ll learn core theory, apply it hands-on, then sell your solution back to the class. Notice how the rhythm repeats—by Day 6 you’ll have integrated everything into a final design competition.”\n\nLearn\nUnderstand PVWatts and PVsyst outputs using your own roof data.\nInterpret annual energy yield, performance ratio, and loss breakdown.\nApply\nSimulate your rooftop system and calculate expected kWh.\nDraw shade obstacles and estimate shade-related losses.\nDay 4 Learning Objectives\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nSell\nBuild a 10-year solar cash-flow using workbook tools.\nPitch system bundles based on trust, value, and local context.\nDay 4\nFacilitator notes:\n“Here are the six objectives for Day 4. Just like yesterday, we’ve organized them into our Learn–Apply–Sell rhythm:\nLEARN — Simulating Solar\n“In this morning’s Learn block, you’ll get hands-on with PVWatts (and PVsyst if it’s available) using the rooftops you photographed. First, we’ll show you how to enter your roof’s tilt, azimuth, and location to generate an annual energy yield and performance ratio. Then we’ll dive into the loss breakdown—so you understand where each kilowatt-hour goes (soiling, thermal losses, mismatch, etc.). By the end, you’ll know exactly how to read those charts and numbers to plan a real installation.”\n\nAPPLY — Laptop & Shade-Scene\n“Next, in Apply, you become your own site-surveyor. You’ll run your rooftop simulation, note the yearly kWh, then switch to the shade-scene tool: draw any trees, chimneys, or water tanks and generate a percentage loss report. This shows in numbers how much shaded hours cost in energy and helps you recommend simple fixes like pruning or panel repositioning.”\n\nSELL — Market, Cash-Flow & Pitch\n“Finally, in Sell, you’ll use our Workbook Tab 5 to build a ten-year cash-flow model—factoring in system cost, O&M, and any supplier financing. Once you see the cumulative savings curve rising, it’s time to craft a short pitch: propose a bundle (e.g. expansion kit plus performance monitoring), highlight trust factors (real warranty, local support), and close with a question: ‘Shall we schedule your upgrade today?’ This wraps up Day 4’s cycle from theory to practice to customer value.”\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTool Overview – Why PVWatts?\nDay 4\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) - PVWatts Calculator\n(https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/index.php)\nAssists with:\nIrradiation modeling\nHouse orientation analysis\nSolar energy output estimation\nFacilitator notes:\nPurpose of PVWatts (20 s)\n“PVWatts is a free, web-based tool that lets you estimate a solar array’s annual and monthly energy production in just a few clicks. It handles three key tasks for you:\nIrradiation modeling – it uses NASA satellite data to calculate average sun hours for your location.\nOrientation analysis – you can adjust tilt and azimuth and instantly see how those choices affect yield.\nOutput estimation – it converts panel wattage into expected kWh/day and kWh/year.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTool Overview – Why PVWatts?\nDay 4\nFacilitator notes:\nIntro & Context (15 s): “On this slide you see screen captures from the NREL PVWatts Calculator. We’ll be using PVWatts today to quickly simulate system output before moving into more complex tools.”\nWalk-through the Interface (30 s): “Let’s look at the main sections:\nLocation input: enter Mosul, Iraq here to load local climate data.\nSystem info: set your DC system size (e.g. 3 kW), module type, and array type.\nAdjustments: panel tilt, azimuth, system losses (dirt, wiring).\nResults: scroll down to see the monthly production graph and annual kWh.”\nWhy PVWatts for Day 4 (20 s): “We choose PVWatts because it’s fast, reliable, and gives you a consistent baseline. Today you’ll:\nRun simulations for different panel tilts and sizes.\nCompare your clean-sheet estimates with the real-world data you collected yesterday.\nLearn how small changes—like rotating your array 10° east—can gain or lose hundreds of kWh per year.”\nTransition to Demo (15 s): “Next up, I’ll demo a live PVWatts run: we’ll input our Mosul coordinates, set a 4 kW array with a 30° tilt, and review the output curve. Then, you’ll pair up and simulate your own scenarios.”\nTrainer Tips\n“Encourage participants to note the “Effective Sun Hours” value—it’s the core driver of kWh.\nRemind them that PVWatts assumes “clean” modules; compare against yesterday’s dust-loss data in your lab.\nIf someone’s connection is slow, show them the desktop screenshot you projected.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nSystem Sizing & Design Assumptions\nDay 4\nAssumption\nValue\nBaseline system size\n1 kW ⇒ ~1 200 kWh / yr\nPanel tilt\n32–36 °\nAzimuth\n0 ° (true south)\nTemp coefficient\n–0.35 % / °C (≈10 % loss @ 50 °C)\nPerformance ratio target\n≥ 75 %\nIrradiation\n~ 5 kWh / m² / day\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s pause and lock in our ‘standard recipe’ before we design any system.”\nBaseline energy yield (10 s):\n“We assume 1 kW of panels will deliver roughly 1 200 kWh per year in Mosul. That’s our rule of thumb for initial sizing.”\u000b\nOptimal tilt & azimuth (15 s):\n“Tilting panels between 32 and 36 degrees and facing them due south (0 ° azimuth) captures the most sun over the year. Small deviations cost you a few percent of output.”\u000b\nTemperature coefficient (20 s):\n“Every degree above STC reduces power by 0.35 %. At 50 °C on a hot roof, you lose about 10 % of nameplate capacity—so pick panels with a good temp-coef or size up accordingly.”\u000b\nPerformance ratio target (15 s):\n“Our Performance Ratio (PR)—the real-world efficiency after losses—should be 75 % or higher. This accounts for wiring, inverter conversion, soiling, and temperature.”\u000b\nIrradiation (10 s):\n“Mosul averages around 5 kWh/m² per day of sun. Multiply that by your array’s kWp and PR to forecast daily kWh.”\n“With these numbers, you can jump into PVWatts, run your first ‘clean-sheet’ simulation, and then compare to our real-world data from Day 3’s roof-rig. Ready? Let’s go!”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nLaptop & Software Check\nDay 4\nChecklist:\nNavigate to pvwatts.nrel.gov\nSet Location: Mosul, Iraq (use search bar)\nConfirm Inputs:\nSystem size: 1 kW\nTilt: 34 ° (midpoint)\nAzimuth: 0 °\nFallback Plan:\nIf site won’t load, open the offline Excel PVWatts template (link on desktop)\nOr use the printed output screenshots in your folder\nFacilitator notes:\n“Before we dive into our live PVWatts run, let’s make sure every laptop is ready.”\nNavigate (20 s):\n“Please open your browser and go to pvwatts.nrel.gov. You should see the welcome page with a world map.”\u000b\nLocation Setup (20 s):\n“In the ‘Location’ box, type Mosul, Iraq and select it from the list. This ensures our radiation data is correct.”\u000b\nConfirm Inputs (30 s):\n“Check that the System Size is 1 kW, Tilt is around 34 °, and Azimuth is 0 °. We’ll adjust these later, but for now these defaults get us started.”\u000b\nFallback Plan (30 s):\n“If PVWatts is loading slowly or your internet hiccups, don’t panic:\nOpen the ‘PVWatts_Offline.xlsx’ on your desktop (this is an Excel template with the same inputs).\nOr, use the printed screenshots in your folder to follow along.”\u000b\nFinal Check (20 s):\n“Once you see the Mosul map pin and the input form ready, give me a thumbs-up or a quick nod. If you’re stuck, raise your hand now—let’s solve it before we launch the simulation.”\nTransition:\u000b “Great—everyone online? Fantastic.

Enter Base Yields\u000b “Copy your certain months kWh values from PVWatts into these two fields. Also enter the Performance Ratio % you observed.”\n2. Set Growth\u000b “Use the Growth % slider to reflect how many extra panels you might add. The Growth Factor is just a numeric echo (e.g. 10 % = factor 1.10).”\n3. Watch Cable & Breaker\u000b “Notice how the ‘Amp (DC)’ jumps from x A at Base to x1 A at Growth, and automatically recommends 4 mm²/25 A vs 10 mm²/63 A. No manual lookup needed.”\n4. Observe Cash-Flow\u000b “Below, the sheet uses your Energy Saving (IQD/month), subtracts any O&M, adds Supplier Credit, and spits out Net and Cumulative Cash for each month.”\n5. Tie-back to PVWatts\u000b “You collected annual kWh in PVWatts—this sheet extrapolates monthly values from that.”\n6. Instructions\u000b “You have 15 minutes: fill in those four manual cells, slide Growth to your target, confirm cable & breaker sizes, then screenshot both tables and the tiny chart of Cumulative Cash.”\nWrap\u000b “This unified model will be your strongest evidence when pitching an expansion—hardware specs and financial impact, all in one view.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nValue-Based Pricing & Trust Pyramid\nDay 4\n❌ Cost-Plus Pricing\n✅ Value-Based Pricing\n“Cost + 10 % margin”\n“Price = customer’s financial gain”\nFacilitator notes:\n1. Cost-Plus vs Value-Based\u000b “Most sellers quote ‘cost plus 10 % profit.’ That traps you in a race to the bottom: cheap gear, tiny margins, endless price haggling.\u000b Instead, value-based pricing charges according to the customer’s financial gain—their reduced diesel bills, avoided downtime, and warranty peace of mind.”\n2. Why Solar Fits Value-Based\u000b “A hybrid system isn’t just hardware; it’s a money-machine. You save IQD X per month—that X is your true price anchor. When you lead with ROI, customers stop arguing over IQD 50 000 here or there.”\n3. Introducing the Trust Pyramid\u000b “But numbers alone aren’t enough. Trust is your ladder to premium price points.\u000b • Product Quality: Start by showing them real panels and inverters you’ve vetted—Level 1.\u000b • Reliability: Then highlight safety measures—DC fuses, proper torque specs, dust-proof frames—Level 2.\u000b • ROI Guarantee: Offer a simple promise: ‘Your system pays for itself in Y years or I’ll discount service fees.’ That moves you to Level 3.\u000b • Partnership: Finally, seal the deal by positioning yourself as their ongoing service partner—monitoring, maintenance, future add-ons—Level 4.”\n4. Bundle Anchor\u000b “When you propose your expansion or cleaning plans, bundle them under this pyramid:\u000b ‘You get German-grade panels we guarantee for 25 years, we install with DC-rated fuses and 18 Nm torque checks, we promise a 3-year payback, and we’ll handle all your maintenance for 12 months.’\u000b That’s a value-packed offer, not just ‘cost + X.’”\nTransition to Next\u000b “With pricing & trust frameworks in hand, let’s pick two premium services to bundle into your Day 4 expansion pitch.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nBundle Brainstorm: Pick 2 Premium Add-Ons\nDay 4\nOption\nWhy It Adds Value\nTilt-Angle Audit\nOptimizes yearly yield by 3–5 %\nTorque Recheck Visit\nEnsures safety & warranty compliance\nWhatsApp Performance Alerts\nReal-time fault detection & remote support\nSeasonal Dust Cleaning\nMaintains ≥ 95 % output & extends panel life\nBattery Health Scan\nEarly fault warning → fewer replacements\nGrid-Export Monitoring\nShows extra revenue via feed-in tariffs\nIn your team, choose any two that best fit Ahmed’s expansion plan.

For grid power at 500 IQD/kWh, 52.8 kWh costs 26 400 IQD. If you’re comparing to a diesel generator, remember it’s charged per amp-month (200 000 IQD/A-mo)—you can break that down to a daily or hourly rate as needed.\nPay-back estimate (15 s)\u000b To see how fast solar covers its own cost, divide total system cost by annual savings. E.g., a 2.4 M IQD system that saves 0.8 M IQD/year pays back in 3 years.\nTariff reminders (10 s)\u000b We always build in a 20 % safety buffer—to cover losses, extra loads or small calculation errors—and account for your battery’s ~90 % round-trip efficiency.

This is the rubric the jury will use during your 5-minute final pitch. You’ll see it displayed on screen as each team presents:\nTechnical Feasibility (25 pts): We’re scoring your on-site measurements, wiring neatness, torque checks, and safety protocol.\nFinancial Logic (35 pts): Your investment summary and ROI calculations need to be 100% accurate. One small assumption slip is okay, but major errors will cost you here.\nClarity & Persuasion (25 pts): We look for a strong hook, clear data, a concise pay-back statement, and a direct ask. If it’s basic but clear, you’ll get Satisfactory; if it’s confusing or drags on, that’s Needs Improvement.\nProfessionalism (15 bonus pts): This is an extra bucket to reward neat slides, correct labels, and punctual delivery. Even if you’re a point or two shy elsewhere, strong professionalism can boost your total.\nThe total maximum is 100 pts, with an automatic “Pass” threshold at 70 pts. As you watch your peers, notice how they align their slides and delivery to these exact criteria—then keep them top of mind for your own pitch.”\n\nIt’s show time for your ultimate pitch 🎥\nDay 5\nFacilitator notes:\n“Okay everyone, this is it—your moment to shine!\nAs each team comes up, you’ll have 5 minutes to deliver your final pitch.\nRemember to follow our template: Hook → Design → Fault-Proof → Ask, and keep an eye on the timer.\nJury, please have your rubric in hand and score each presentation.\nTeams, take your places—let’s get started!”\n\nLive Jury Scores & Results\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 5\nEach team, collect your jury scores and enter them into the Pitch Rubric section on Workbook Tab 5.\nFacilitator notes:\n“Alright, everyone—our jury have finished scoring.\nHere’s what you see:\nYour individual criterion scores and your total out of 100.\nThe Next Step column shows PASS for those who hit your targets, and REVISE for teams with areas to strengthen.\u000b\nAction for all teams:\nCollect your individual jury score sheets.\nEnter those numbers into the Pitch Rubric section on Workbook Tab 5 (the green input cells).\u000b\nIf you see “ REVISE”:\nThis is not a certificate failure—it’s your chance to refine the spots the jury flagged.\nYou have 15 minutes to update your slide or pitch bullet, then you’re welcome to re-pitch briefly.\u000b\nIf you see “PASS”:\nCongratulations!

On the right, the ‘After’: every panel is clean and correctly pitched, all M8 bolts torqued to 18 Nm, cables neatly clipped and labeled. That simple rework boosted output by 10 % and dropped maintenance calls almost overnight.”\u000b\nWalk Through Case Study B (20 s):\u000b “In Case B, the install used undersized 4 mm² cable without any DC fuses—that’s a fire hazard and guaranteed voltage drop. We rewired it with 6 mm² conductors, installed DC-rated fuses at the combiner box, and used proper latching MC4 connectors. The result? Zero faults in six months and a happy customer who refers us repeatedly.”\u000b\nKey Takeaway (10 s):\u000b “These ‘Before → After’ stories prove that attention to torque, wiring standards, and protective devices not only keeps people safe but also makes you the go-to pro in Mosul’s booming solar market.”\n“Keep these examples in mind as you prepare your final presentations—your portfolio is your strongest sales tool.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nPortfolio Excellence\nDay 5\nTeam B\nTeam A\nTeam C\nTop 3 Final Pitches\nFacilitator notes:\nCelebrate Excellence:\u000b “Congratulations, everyone!

Optimal tilt depends on\nlocation and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is\n32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best\norientation.\n\n76\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other\nstructures can block sunlight from reaching\nsolar panels. Even partial shading\nsignificantly reduces power output, as the\nentire string performance drops to that of\nthe shaded panel. To maximize energy\nproduction year-round, it's important to\navoid shaded spots when installing solar\npanels.\n\n77\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\n1. What is the peak load? (in Amps)\n2. What is the average load? (in Amps)\n3. What is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\n4. What is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\n5. What is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\n6. How many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries\nwithout other input sources?)\n7. Is there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\n8. What is the layout of the roof? Include equipment, shading obstacles, or barriers affecting solar\ninstallation.\n9. What is the direction of true south?\n10. What are the building’s operating hours?\n11. How many days per week is the building operational?\n12. What type of building is it? (Residential, commercial, or industrial)\n13. Are there any shading risks? (e.g., trees or nearby buildings)\n14. Any additional information?\n\n78 \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nDust Loss in Mosul\n● 15 % drop after 4 weeks without\ncleaning\n● Weekly wipe → > 95 % performance\nDesign\n* Photo of dusty panel being swept\n*Mini bar-chart contrasting “Clean” vs.\n“Dusty” panel output\n\n79\nWind-Load & Torque Logic\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n● F = q × Cₚ × A\n● Mosul gusts ≈ 35 m/s ⇒ 1.5 kN/m²\npressure\n● Torque every M8 bolt to 18 Nm\n*Photo of a torque wrench\n“clicking” on an M8 bolt,\nannotated “18 Nm”\nSmall inset: stylized wind arrow\nstriking a rooftop array, labeled\n“35 m/s”\n\n80\nMounting System – Iraqi Conditions\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n*Photo B: Bent rail due\nto no expansion gap\n*Photo A: Cracked\nconcrete from poor\nanchor curing\n*Photo C: Rusted\nslot-clips in dusty\nrooftop\n\n81\nDC Connection Perfection\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nStep 1\nStrip Cable\n(8 mm insulation)\nStep 2\nInsert Pin\n(fully home)\n*Photo A: cleanly stripped PV cable *Photo B: pin inserted to shoulder\nStep 3\nCrimp\n(18 Nm torque)\nStep 4\nPull-Test\n(≥ 150 N retention)\n*Photo C: crimper on pin, listen for “click” *Photo D: pull-tester reading ≥ 150 N\n\n82\nHaykal Mounting Frame – Key Checks\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n● Kit frame (bolt-together) vs welded steel\n● Torque spec 18 Nm\n● Must resist wind-load ≥ 1.5 kN/m² on Mosul\nroofs\n\n83 \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nRooftop Hazards & PPE\n🪜 Ladder at 75°: “Set ladder at\na 75° angle for stability.”\n🪢 Harness & Anchor: “Always\nwear a fall-arrest harness\nclipped to a certified anchor.”\n🥽🧤 Gloves & Goggles:\n“Insulated gloves and safety\nglasses on at all times.”\n\n84\nFuse & Ground Rules\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n● Fuse on positive DC as close to battery as possible\n● Use DC-rated breakers for combiner if > 4 strings\n● Grounding and lightning rod ≥ 2 m, copper-clad 16 mm Ø.
