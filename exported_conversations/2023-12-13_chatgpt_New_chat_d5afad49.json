      "content": "For a savory pie of the size you're making, I'd recommend the following proportions:\n\n- **Eggs**: Use 3 to 4 large eggs. This will help bind the filling and give it a nice, custardy texture.\n- **Cream**: About 1 cup (240 ml) of cream. This will add richness and moisture to the filling.\n\nThese quantities should work well with the amount of pumpkin, leeks, potatoes, and onion you have, assuming you're using a standard 9-inch pie dish. Feel free to adjust slightly based on the consistency of the filling and your personal preference.",
