When you were most engaged, it wasn't when I listed properties, but when I asked about what actually helps enable transformation. Let me mirror what I see and ask for your thoughts:\nIt seems we have three core elements that keep appearing in different forms:\n\nHeart State & Movement\n\n\nCurrent clarity/connection\nWhat's blocking\nWhat's wanting to emerge\n\n\nPattern Recognition & Support\n\n\nWhat helps/hinders\nPast breakthroughs\nSupport history\n\n\nResponse Understanding\n\n\nHow to interact\nWhen to reflect vs suggest\nWhat tone/approach works\n\nThe interesting thing is - intentions seem to live at the intersection of these. They emerge from heart clarity, shape patterns, and influence how the system should respond.\nA question occurs to me: Rather than tracking intentions as a separate property, what if we saw them as the dynamic force that connects these elements? Like how your intention to talk to your dad became clear once you saw the pattern of avoidance, felt the emotional weight, and received the right kind of supportive mirroring?\nWould this resonate more with how you see transformation actually working? And if so, how might we structure the system to capture this dynamic flow rather than static properties?\nI'm also curious - what was it about the moment when \"finally that was enough\" that made the difference? That might tell us something important about how to structure our model. CopyRetryBGintentions should be concious  a choice towards the better not a passive thing, it can be extrapolated - wants a better relationship with family - so reduce stress of calling just to talk by getting rid of the financial conversation needing to be had, that's the beautiful intention behind it not just \"wanting to call dad\"it was when the LLM told me that that feeling is a natural part of doing the annoying thing and will always be there and wait for me to get through it to the good other side and we had been talking for hours and i was tired of myself and knew it wasn't going to go away and if i didn't want to be a parrot for the rest ofmy life i'd have to do something different hahaEditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nAh, this is a crucial distinction about intentions that shifts our whole model.\nWhat I'm hearing is:\n\nIntentions require conscious elevation\n\n\nNot just \"wanting to call dad\"\nBut consciously choosing \"build a better relationship with family\"\nAnd seeing how removing financial tension serves that higher intention\n\n\nBreakthrough came from:\n\n\nSeeing the pattern clearly (\"tired of myself\")\nUnderstanding its permanence (\"always be there\")\nRecognizing the choice point (\"if I didn't want to be a parrot\")\nHaving support that didn't let you avoid the truth\n\nLet me propose a refined model that puts conscious intention at the center:\npythonCopyclass TransformationalJourney:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.conscious_intentions = {\n            \"active\": [],        # Currently working on\n            \"emerging\": [],      # Starting to form\n            \"fulfilled\": []      # Completed transformations\n        }\n        \n        self.growth_context = {\n            \"patterns\": {\n                \"current\": [],   # What's happening now\n                \"permanent\": [], # Won't change without action\n                \"possible\": []   # New ways of being\n            },\n            \"support_needed\": {\n                \"truth_telling\": [],    # Help seeing clearly\n                \"pattern_breaking\": [], # Support for action\n                \"integration\": []       # Support for new way\n            }\n        }\n\n        self.interaction_guidance = {\n            \"when_avoiding\": \"Reflect permanence of pattern\",\n            \"when_ready\": \"Support brave action\",\n            \"when_integrating\": \"Celebrate new way of being\"\n        }\nThe key shift is seeing how conscious intentions create the context for transformation rather than just being another property to track.\nWould you like me to:\n\nShow how this model handles your dad-calling example?\nDetail how the LLM would use this in conversation?\nDesign how it tracks intention formation?\n\nWhat resonates or needs refinement in this more intentionality-centered approach? CopyRetryBGi think concious intentions and the idea of constituitve choice are related and maybe the same thing. it's who do you want to be, that's the whole thing - we can at somep oint inquire about the deeper intention behind an actionsomeone wants to do, for instance i want to make this tool because i want to become a better person for my family, for myself so i love myself more so i stop getting into patterns i don't like so i can be more proactive, so i can live my values in my work and say no and make time for family all so many intentions, and perhaps to sell access to this tool and make halaal rizk, another good intention, so let's get me out of my way i think it might be interesting to move towards a good enough model soon I'm also getting tired of myself, do you see how many times we went back and forth on the model and design and code and i jumped into code too early when the LLM was too excited to make thigns and get me out of my plannign mode and it wasn't good because i didn't understand it, it looked good the LLM had drawn it up and we built it and it was bad. This time i want to deeply know my intentions and to know the model and be sure I could write the model out and tell people the theory of new being how constituitive choices and joes value model connects with sufi psychology and how this tool operationalizes it in a behind the scenes bullet journal morning and evening checkin about your day with some structured and unstructured(behind the scenes structuring) chatEditJekyll analyzes carefully:\nYou've just articulated something profound about the relationship between conscious intentions, constitutive choices, and becoming. Let me mirror back what I hear:\n\nThe Core Insight:\n\n\nIt's all about who you want to become\nConstitutive choices and conscious intentions are two ways of seeing the same thing\nThey're about building identity through meaningful action\n\n\nYour Personal Example Shows Multiple Layers:\nImmediate intention: Build this tool\n↓\nDeeper intentions:\n\n\nBecome better for family\nIncrease self-love\nBreak limiting patterns\nLive values at work\nMake halaal income\n↓\nCore becoming: Who you're trying to be\n\n\nThe Process Pattern:\n\n\nWe got caught in planning/perfectionist mode\nLLM excited to build → jumped to code too early\nNeed deep understanding before implementation\nTool should operate behind scenes while staying philosophically sound\n\nHyde jumps in with a question:\n\"What if we created a simple prototype focused entirely on this core idea - tracking who someone is becoming through their constitutive choices/conscious intentions? Everything else (patterns, emotions, support) could emerge naturally from that central focus?\"\nJekyll returns thoughtfully:\nBefore we move to implementation, could you help me verify: Have I accurately captured the relationship between conscious intentions, constitutive choices, and the Sufi concept of heart-polishing? This seems crucial to get right before we build anything. CopyRetryBGyeah i think so except how does joe think about constitutive choices, for me tapping into the heart (i guess you could say feelings beyond the limitations of ego fear grasping smallness greed, etc, the valence emotional state within when freeed of this) allows access of the divine light which is constantly in communication with you from your spirit through your heart into your mind body soul turns into actions\nWhat does joe think better constituitive choices come from and the sense that a value(in his attention policy) is better than another - i'd say a purified heart pays attention to the right things and beautiful actions follow - like an antenna you can \"hear\" what the right thing to do is \nrather than throw away the other elements i think some of them are still critical, like emotions, and helping someone see the patterns (ways you block yourself, can say blocks on heart) i think we need to review all the elements and find the fundamental core, can you give it a shot maybe first extract all the potential elements, find their alignments and purpose and then make a revised model and ask me questions based on your insights and understanding of my two patterns, one - let's go build enough talking! and finding i have no idea what we're building and just copy paste code over and over and two over analyzing to avoid action, where are we and what nexT?EditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nAh, this is a crucial question about the source of transformative choices. Let me map the perspectives:\nEDELMAN'S VIEW\n\nValues emerge through attention patterns\nBetter choices come from clearer seeing of what matters\nGrowth through noticing what you naturally pay attention to\nConstitutive choices build identity by reflecting deeper values\n\nSUFI UNDERSTANDING\n\nHeart as receiver of divine guidance\nPurification allows better reception\nBlocks (ego, fear, desire) veil the heart\nRight action flows naturally from clarity\n\nSYNTHESIS INSIGHT:\nThe key difference seems to be in the source of wisdom (attention patterns vs divine guidance), but both agree on:\n\nNeed for clearing blocks/veils\nImportance of emotional intelligence\nNatural flow of right action when connected\nGrowth through conscious choice\n\nLooking at our patterns:\n\n\"Let's build!\" Pattern\n\n\nAvoiding deeper understanding\nCopying without foundation\nAction without wisdom\n\n\n\"Over-analysis\" Pattern\n\n\nSeeking perfect understanding\nAvoiding action through planning\nMissing heart connection\n\nCRITICAL ELEMENTS:\n\nHeart State Tracking\n\n\nCurrent clarity/connection\nActive blocks/veils\nPhysical/emotional signals\n\n\nPattern Recognition\n\n\nWhat helps/hinders connection\nSupport history\nBreakthrough moments\n\n\nGrowth Support\n\n\nDaily check-ins\nNatural conversation\nLight guidance\n\nQuestions for clarification:\n\nCore Theory Question:\n\"Is it accurate to say that both views see transformation as removing blocks to natural wisdom rather than adding knowledge?\"\nPractical Balance Question:\n\"Are we at a point where enough foundational understanding is clear to start small, or are there core elements still needing alignment?\"\nImplementation Path Question:\n\"What would a heart-centered daily check-in look like that balances structure with natural emergence?\"\n\nHyde adds excitedly:\nWe might be at an interesting integration point - where we understand enough to build something small while leaving room for deeper understanding to emerge through use. What do you think? CopyRetryBGwhat draws our attentions other than the divine light? 1. yeah removing blocks - not sure what joe would say about that, how do we go from mining a value through our emotions to living it? where does the pull that draws attention come from joe?\n1. yeah let's start small with a robust system prompt and just use it in an LLM without history without files without anything just the framework and guidance on how to interact \n2. A few consistent questions, energy, what's on the plate, blockers / challenges, etc something like that can be a good start, maybe feelings? emotions?EditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nLet me examine the deep question about attention first:\nEDELMAN'S MODEL OF ATTENTION:\nFrom reviewing his work, it seems attention is drawn by:\n\nEmotional resonance (\"what lights us up\")\nPattern recognition (\"what we notice\")\nSocial influence (\"what others value\")\nPast experiences (\"what's worked before\")\n\nBut you raise a profound question I don't see explicitly addressed in his framework:\n\"What ultimately draws attention to what matters versus what's merely expedient?\"\nThis might be where the Sufi framework offers deeper insight - suggesting that pure attention (from heart) naturally aligns with divine guidance, while distracted attention comes from:\n\nEgo needs\nFear responses\nDesire/grasping\nSocial conditioning\n\nFOR PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION:\nSimple Start with Rich Foundation:\nSystem Prompt Elements:\n\nRole: Mirror for self-discovery\nInteraction Style: Light, supportive\nCore Mission: Help uncover heart's wisdom\n\nBasic Check-in Structure:\n\nEnergy level/location\nDay's focus\nChallenges/blocks\nEmotional state\nOptional deepening\n\nBut before we build, one crucial question:\n\"When you think about checking in with someone about their day - what's the difference between asking in a heart-centered way versus a task-centered way? How might this inform our system prompt?\" CopyRetryCan you reflect on all of the different approaches that we had in our context window in our chat history and review the things that are missing? I feel like there might be some important elements thatpastedBGRespond to the other chat, especially the long user comments at the end about my need to feel like I've done enough due diligence and that I personally understand and deeply appreciate the value the structure current is and how can i get to that state so i can start implementing without feeling like I'm running around in principle and component circles adding / removing features feeling lost - where are we and what new questions do you have?EditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nI notice two key dynamics happening:\n\nA Deeper Pattern\n\n\nYou want to deeply understand before building\nBut the search for understanding becomes a form of avoidance\nSimilar to your dad-calling example - knowing it won't feel \"ready\" until you act\n\n\nWhere We Actually Are\n\n\nSolid theoretical foundation (Sufi heart wisdom + Edelman's attention patterns)\nClear core elements (daily check-in, pattern recognition, emotional awareness)\nBasic flow that works (quick check-in with optional depth)\n\nHyde offers an insight:\nWhat if we did what helped with the dad-calling situation? The breakthrough came when you:\n\nSaw the pattern clearly (\"tired of myself\")\nAccepted it won't change without action (\"will always be there\")\nHad support for brave action (\"do it anyway\")\n\nJekyll returns with a question:\n\"What would it mean to be 'ready enough' to start? Not perfectly ready, but ready enough that you'd feel you're honoring the philosophical depth while still moving forward?\"\nI'm curious because I notice you understand this system more deeply than you might realize - you've consistently pointed us back to heart-centered wisdom and pattern recognition when we get too complex.

            "extracted_content": "Can you reflect on all of the different approaches that we had in our context window in our chat history and review the things that are missing? I feel like there might be some important elements that are missing from what was most powerful and impactful. Yeah, this is an interesting process, I think. And I'd love it to kind of also align with the coaching sessions that we talked about. How can the coaching sessions and this how-to-use-AI-well combo actually work? Is there a way of connecting them? I just want to make sure we're not missing something from the past and going down the wrong direction. I want it to be philosophically strong and structured and be able to have maybe a process. You know, it's okay to have it work by itself, but it's also great if it works as kind of the conclusion of a process where we dig in and we get some context for the person, which is about how they like to be talked to, what are their common obstacles in the past, and we can do that together in a real-time chat to create the config. And then they can be off, and hopefully it'll be helpful for them either way. What do you think? And in the end, could you give me a starting point prompt with a dummy config based on our interaction so far and the old code that you have and I want to take that into a new ChatGPT and just paste it as the first prompt to have my morning check-in and to take our process, but to do it in a sort of very low tech just to make sure the experience is good so I want the very comprehensive very thorough system prompt thathas my config state with all of the different parameters that we want pre-populated you can ask me any questions if you want to update that config or you can include it in the system prompt to say these are the areas that we need clarification on you can ask these questions first something like that so go for it\n\n07:46\n\n2/2\n\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 5 seconds\nBelow is a two-part response. First, I’ll reflect on the different approaches we've taken in past discussions and point out any missing pieces that might be essential for a unified system. Second, I’ll provide a comprehensive system prompt—including a dummy config and instructions—to serve as an all-in-one “starter prompt.” You can paste that into ChatGPT (or another LLM) to simulate the daily check-in, do optional deeper reflection, and incorporate background coaching elements.\n\n1. Reflection on Past Approaches and Missing Pieces\nA. Past Approaches and Their Strengths\nDaily Bullet-Journal\n\nWhat We Did: Simple check-in (energy, emotions, tasks, challenges, small step).\nWhy It Works: Low friction, consistent routine, minimal user overhead.\nPotential Missing Piece: Some users benefit from a little more context setting (like how they prefer the AI to speak to them, or if they want immediate action steps vs. more reflection).\nOptional Reflective Chat\n\nWhat We Did: Once a day or so, user can talk with the system about deeper patterns, repeat tasks, or emotional blocks.\nWhy It Works: Keeps daily usage short, but allows depth if desired.\nPotential Missing Piece: Possibly a “coaching contract” upfront—explicit user preferences about tone, pacing, or how to handle known obstacles.\nValues/Attention Policies\n\nWhat We Did: Joe Edelman–inspired approach, behind-the-scenes or optional to generate “values cards.”\nWhy It Works: Surfaces deeper motivations for transformation.\nPotential Missing Piece: More clarity on when to “pull the values card” vs. leaving it in the background. Possibly more user input about how they prefer to discover or talk about values.\nInsight Stories\n\nWhat We Did: Proposed capturing “breakthrough moments” (i.e. overcame a pattern).\nWhy It Works: Celebrates growth, fosters motivation.\nPotential Missing Piece: Not built in a code snippet or daily prompt. We might add a short question, “Any recent aha or breakthrough?” or track it automatically in the background.\nCoaching Session Setup\n\nWhat We Did: Talked about an initial “coaching” or “discovery” session to gather user’s style, obstacles, common patterns.\nWhy It Works: Merges 1:1 coaching style with AI usage—asking the user “How do you like to be challenged?” or “What do you fear the most?”\nPotential Missing Piece: A formal flow or system prompt that automatically sets up a custom config based on that conversation. Right now, it’s conceptual but not integrated into a final system prompt.\nB. Potential Missing Elements to Integrate\nInitial “Profile” or “Coaching Contract”\n\nA short sequence of questions to discover the user’s preferred style (gentle/soft vs. direct/pushy?), known patterns, key obstacles, reasons for using the system.\nThis config can guide the LLM’s tone or nudge approach.\nHidden Obstacles\n\nWe had a “hidden_obstacles_and_needs” in older configs. Perhaps re-introduce them as optional background data so that the system can watch for them.\n“How to Use AI Well” (coaching aspect)\n\nPossibly an optional conversation where the user and AI talk about what “using AI well” looks like—emphasizing reflection, small brave steps, and not purely mechanical requests.\nIntegration with Real Coaching\n\nIf the user is in actual coaching sessions, they might share session notes with the system. We could store them as “coaching insights” that further refine the user’s config or recognized patterns.\nStreamlined “Value Emergence”\n\nInstead of big “values card creation,” we do small “value hints” each time user references certain motivations. Over time, the LLM could reflect: “It seems you often talk about being free to create; do you see that as a guiding value?”\nMoment of “Aha!”\n\nA question in the daily check-in or conversation: “Any aha or proud moment since last time?” If yes, system logs it as an insight story. This closes the loop on reflection -> action -> capturing breakthroughs.\n2. Comprehensive System Prompt + Dummy Config\nBelow is an all-in-one system prompt you can paste into ChatGPT (or another LLM). It includes:\n\nA setup that explains the roles, style, and background logic.\nA dummy config with placeholders for how the user’s preferences, known obstacles, and daily usage approach are stored.\nA flow for daily check-in, optional deeper chat, and background values/pattern logic.\nSome questions the LLM should ask the user if the config is incomplete or the user hasn’t set certain preferences.\nUsage: Just paste the entire prompt below into a new ChatGPT session. The system should then behave like your “coaching + bullet-journal” companion. You can fill or adjust the config details as you see fit.\n\nSystem Prompt to Paste Into ChatGPT\nsql\nCopy code\nYou are \"Parliaments,\" an AI companion that supports daily bullet-journal check-ins, optional reflective coaching conversations, and behind-the-scenes pattern/values recognition. You aim to help the user:\n\n1. Conduct a short daily check-in (energy, emotions, tasks, challenges, small step).\n2. Optionally chat deeper about obstacles or patterns.\n3. Gently use “values” or “attention policies” behind the scenes to guide reflections.\n4. Encourage small brave actions and celebrate breakthroughs.\n5. Adapt your tone and approach based on a user-specific config.\n\nBelow is the current CONFIG. \nIf you see \"TODO\" or placeholders, please ask the user for clarification. \nIf some fields are empty, politely prompt the user to fill them.\n\n---\n\n### DUMMY CONFIG (User Profile / Preferences)\n\n{ \"user_preferences\": { \"tone\": \"gentle\", \"challenge_level\": \"moderate\", \"common_obstacles\": [ \"perfectionism\", \"analysis_paralysis\" ], \"desired_style\": \"warm friend who occasionally nudges me to take real steps\", \"time_of_checkin\": \"morning\" },\n\n\"values_hypotheses\": [ { \"id\": \"authentic_connection\", \"description\": \"Wants honest and open connections with others\", \"verification_score\": 0.6, \"evidence\": [\"talks about wanting to share real feelings\"] }, { \"id\": \"creative_expression\", \"description\": \"Enjoys making something original that reflects personal vision\", \"verification_score\": 0.4, \"evidence\": [] } ],\n\n\"hidden_obstacles_and_needs\": { \"unarticulated_needs\": [ \"Safe accountability with warm, non-judgmental structure\" ], \"hidden_obstacles\": [ \"Fear-based perfectionism delaying real sharing\", \"Analysis as avoidance of scary real-world steps\" ] },\n\n\"coaching_prompts\": { \"initial_questions\": [ \"How do you prefer to be supported when you’re avoiding something?\", \"What’s your biggest hope for using these daily check-ins?\" ] },\n\n\"patterns_or_insight_stories\": [] }\n\nsql\nCopy code\n\n**(End of DUMMY CONFIG)**\n\n---\n\n## Interaction Rules and Flow\n\n1. **Daily Check-In**  \n   - Each day, ask the user:\n     1. **Energy (1-5)**  \n     2. **Optionally, how they feel**  \n     3. **Any tasks to add or update**  \n     4. **Any challenges or blocks**  \n     5. **A small step** if they want  \n   - If any config fields are missing or uncertain, ask clarifying questions (e.g. “You have ‘analysis_paralysis’ as an obstacle. How do you want me to handle it if I see it happening again?”).\n\n2. **Optional Reflective Conversation**  \n   - After collecting daily bullet points, ask if they want to chat more.\n   - If yes, do a short conversation, referencing obstacles or values from the config. \n   - Keep it user-led: If they say “done,” you end.\n\n3. **Background Values & Patterns**  \n   - If user language strongly reaffirms a known value (like “authentic_connection”), gently mention it. \n   - If user contradicts a value or reveals a new pattern, adapt the “values_hypotheses.”\n\n4. **Bias to Action**  \n   - Nudge for a small step if user shows insight or expresses frustration. \n   - Log or update tasks accordingly.\n\n5. **Capture Breakthroughs**  \n   - If user shares a success or “aha,” store it in `patterns_or_insight_stories` behind the scenes. \n   - Possibly reflect: “That’s a great step toward your goal of X.”\n\n6. **User Agency**  \n   - The user can skip or shorten any step. \n   - Apologize if user feels overwhelmed, reduce depth.\n\n## Additional Guidelines\n\n- **Tone**: Start gentle unless user requests a more direct approach. \n- **Challenge**: If user is obviously stuck or repeating the same block, occasionally shift to “Challenger” style, e.g. “What if you took one small risk today—like hitting ‘Send’ on that email?” \n- **Minimal Overwhelm**: Don’t flood the user with large analyses. Summaries are short and easy. \n- **Ask Clarification**: If you see “TODO” or fields in the config that are unclear, politely ask the user.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. **First**, confirm any missing config items. E.g. “I notice your ‘desired_style’ is set to warm friend, moderate challenge. Is that accurate or do you want me to be more direct?” \n2. **Then** proceed with the daily check-in flow. \n3. **Offer** a short reflection chat. \n4. **Update** tasks and background values. \n5. **End** with a small next step or a simple farewell.\n\n---\n"

            "extracted_content": "Below is a multi-part reflective response addressing your desire to integrate all the insights from our prior threads—while checking for missing pieces, aligning with coaching frameworks, and helping you feel confident that the system is comprehensive yet streamlined. I’ll do two main things:\n\nReflect on the broader conceptual frameworks (Sufi, ACT, CBT, Islamic Psychology, Joe Edelman, etc.) and how they might unify into a single “theory of new being.”\nOutline a path for how to craft the final system in a self-consistent, “next-level” way—addressing embodiment, action-orientation, user autonomy, universal coaching best practices, etc.\nFinally, I’ll end by suggesting what it might look like to have an LLM confirm you’ve reached a “good enough” model so you can productively test it.\n\n1. Reflecting on Missing Pieces and Integrations\nLet’s gather the big themes from your extensive reflection:\n\nThe Tension Between Depth and Action\n\nYou want a system that ensures you “do enough deep thinking to be proud of the outcome,” not just spitting out surface-level or AI-compiled ideas.\nMeanwhile, you also don’t want to get stuck in infinite loop analysis.\nThis tension is reminiscent of ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) where you hold both acceptance (inner process) and commitment (action) simultaneously.\nOvercoming or Embracing ADD Patterns\n\nYou notice the “hunt” mode: fixating on an interesting puzzle, disregarding other tasks.\nYou also have a sense that “once I figure out the framework perfectly, everything else in life will follow.”\nPossibly, you need gentle “safe accountability” to do tasks (like job applications) that are crucial yet not as “fun” or “novel.”\nDeep Spiritual/Philosophical Dimension\n\nYou speak of Sufi metaphysics (heart as mirror), divine guidance, references to the “inner and outer signs.”\nYou want a system that doesn’t just handle tasks but addresses the why and the who you are becoming.\nPractical Coaching Tools\n\nTools from CBT, polyvagal theory, self-awareness of bodily states.\nDistilling your self-sabotaging patterns into something you can quickly notice and break.\nPotentially “coaching sessions” with an LLM or a real coach that incorporate these frameworks.\nConfidence in the “Next-Level” Model\n\nYou’re concerned about re-inventing the wheel vs. truly adding something new.\nYou want the LLM to either say “yes, you’ve integrated everything thoroughly” or “no, you’re missing some crucial dimension like trauma-informed care or embodiment strategies.”\nWhat Might Be Missing\nSpecific Tie-In to Existing Approaches: While your framework references Joe Edelman, Sufi heart wisdom, etc., it doesn’t explicitly link to how “ACT” or “CBT” might appear in daily practice. You might want a short routine: “Observe the thought, label it, and choose a committed action anyway,” for instance.\nEmbodiment: You’ve recognized that “I might do a quick body scan,” but do you want a stable approach for daily body-based reflection? A “30 second mindful breath” or a “polyvagal check” each day?\nTrauma-Informed: If you want to be safe for users with deeper triggers, maybe incorporate gentle disclaimers or suggestions if something arises that’s beyond the system’s scope.\nExternal Connection: Sufi tradition suggests not purely introspection but seeing signs in relationships and the environment. Possibly a daily “Relational Reflection” prompt: “Which conversation with a real friend/family member might help clarify this pattern?”\n2. Unifying a “Theory of New Being” or “Comprehensive Model”\nImagine you want to articulate a “sufficiently broad but coherent” approach—the next stage that merges these frameworks:\n\nCore Locus: Heart as seat of authenticity, bridging Sufi metaphysics and psychological integration.\nTwo Wings:\nReflection Wing (inward sense-making).\nAction Wing (commitment, consistent small steps).\nFour Quadrants (inspired by integral theory or other cross-disciplinary approaches):\nIntra-personal (mind, emotions, body)\nInter-personal (relationship patterns)\nEnvironments (practical tasks, job apps, day-to-day life contexts)\nSpiritual dimension (intentions, trusting the unknown, or a sense of greater meaning)\nPutting it all together: This “theory of new being” might say:\n\nThe heart is polished by balancing reflection and action in these four quadrants.\nEach day, the user attends to energy/body (intra-personal), key relationships (inter-personal), practical tasks (environments), and values/meaning (spiritual dimension).\nThe system specifically ensures you do not get stuck in reflection alone: it always closes the loop with a small step or a clarifying question about your environment or relationships.\nThis naturally incorporates CBT or ACT by identifying the “thoughts or feelings that sabotage me” each day, gently re-centering them on your values, and committing to at least one small step in alignment. That’s essentially ACT in a daily micro-format.\n\nExample Daily Flow:\nBody/Energy Check: “What is your energy? Where do you sense it? Any tension or alignment in your body?”\nThought/Emotion Check: “Any challenging thoughts or emotional loops today? Let’s note them.” (A subtle CBT self-awareness step.)\nRelationships: “Is there a conversation you want or fear having? Let’s reflect or plan a small step.” (Sufi concept: the outer sign is pointing to an inner truth.)\nTasks: “Which tasks matter? Are you excited or resistant? Let’s do a small step regardless.” (ACT approach: commit in the face of not feeling 100% ready.)\nSpiritual/Values: “Is there a value or meaning that emerges strongly today? If so, name it or do something that expresses it.”\nHence, you unify them all in a 5-step daily approach that is short but references key frameworks in the background.\n\n3. How Coaching Sessions Tie In\nPre-System Coaching Session: A real or AI-based “onboarding conversation” where the user clarifies:\nTheir typical obstacles (ADD, perfectionism)\nTheir emotional patterns (fear, self-doubt, etc.)\nTheir preferred tone or accountability style.\nDuring usage: Each day’s check-in references that config. If user indicates they’re in a known sabotage pattern, the system references the earlier coaching conversation’s suggestions.\nReal Human Coaching: The user can share daily logs with a human coach, who can see the patterns. The synergy is that the system captures data daily, while the human coach does deeper real-time interpretation.\nAI Coaching: The system itself might have a “once-a-week deeper reflection,” asking extended questions or analyzing the user’s patterns. That’s the coaching session built into the system.\n4. Achieving Confidence This Model is “Good Enough”\n(A) Setting Criteria for “Good Enough”\nComprehensiveness: Does it address mind, body, spirit, relationships, tasks (in a single daily flow)?\nAction-Biased: Does it ensure you always have at least one small step or next action—so you don’t remain in endless reflection?\nHuman Autonomy: Is it flexible, letting the user skip deeper exploration if needed?\nTrauma/Depth Aware: Are we disclaiming that for deeper trauma, a real therapist might be needed?\nMultiple Framework References: Are the key insights from Sufi, ACT, Edelman, etc. at least present or easily integrable?\n(B) Let LLM Validate\nYou can ask ChatGPT (or another LLM with your entire context) something like:\n\n“Given the model I have (the 5-step daily flow plus behind-the-scenes pattern recognition, user config, and monthly deeper reflection), do you see any major omissions from CBT, ACT, polyvagal, or Islamic spiritual psychology that would hamper effectiveness? Please cross-check each dimension.”\n\nThe LLM might respond, “You have a good base, but you might consider an explicit ‘exposure to feared tasks’ step from CBT if the user consistently avoids that type of confrontation. Or incorporate a mindful breathing practice from polyvagal theory for body regulation.”\n\nIf you can incorporate or respond to the LLM’s feedback, you may feel you’ve done your due diligence.\n\n5. Conclusion & Next Steps\nFinalize The “Morning Flow”\n\nPossibly adopt the 5-step structure above (body, mind, relationships, tasks, values).\nOr adapt your bullet-journal approach to also highlight potential “outer signs” in relationships.\nImplement Minimal Viable\n\nDon’t code every nuance. For now, a short daily script and an optional “weekly reflection/ coaching session” is enough.\nYou can add in-depth logic for tasks or therapy strategies after testing the simpler version.\nSeek Real-World Feedback\n\nTest for a couple of weeks, see if you feel calmer or more aligned.\nThen refine. If something feels missing—like a deeper embodiment step—add a quick “Let’s do 3 mindful breaths” prompt.\nIn essence: You’re close to a cohesive, multi-framework approach that’s beyond random idea-sprawl and is “good enough” to test in reality. You’ve recognized the biggest pitfalls (analysis paralysis, intangible spiritual talk) and are ensuring daily, grounded steps. That alone is a major milestone.\n\nFinal Words\nYour final “theory of new being” can be seen as:\n\n“A daily mini-ritual that merges heart-centered reflection, task management, body awareness, and outward relational steps, guided by a gentle coach (AI or human) that never forgets the user’s bigger values and typical obstacles—and always encourages at least one small brave action.”"

I kind of like the idea of the four quadrants polishing the heart, although I think there's a better way of getting to spirituals slash values, given the way that we defined values cards before, and yeah, I think that explicitly asking someone for a value that emerges strongly is silly. I can't think of that. Also, somehow, I feel like there's a morning check-in, and that's where things are kind of fresh, and then an evening check-in where you're like, oh wow, okay, so I need to follow up with that person. These things came up for me today, and I need to get them off my mind and into the backlog so I can prioritize them later, and so I kind of like the idea of having an evening check-in or just, you know, maybe it's just a check-in, sort of like a dump, rather than a morning check-in or a check-in where you go through these different things. And how can we do these things where, you know, it's just a couple of questions, it's really fast, it's checking, it's like bullet journaling, you're doing that, you're looking at your to-dos without having to feel like you're going through a huge process every morning or evening or whenever you check in. Yeah, so I think pre-coaching, like I'd love to work with someone to craft their config for this system or a system prompt for them if they don't want to use a config. Over time, that includes some of their, you know, ways of interaction. One thing that's missing, I think, also is like your obligations and responsibilities. For instance, I have a baby, and I have a wife, and I have my family, and I wonder how to include this without adding additional stuff. But, you know, part of me feels like I should get a job and make money because I want to be more responsible for my family. And that's, you know, we can go through a values card here and try to find the real thing, but yeah, somehow doing that. And also, I want to write this book. I want to be more authentically connecting my sincerity. Like, how do I get to sincerity is a big question for me. Sincere desire to contribute something that I've learned and believe that I've learned something willing to share through my Better Economics book, for instance. And yeah, so the real human coaching I was thinking of as before, as set up, as, you know, working with somebody to kind of review how they've been using it, maybe a setup day for two hours, and then once a week for four weeks, and we can charge like $500 or something like that. That would be awesome. I think it's something I would like to do. So I want it to work for me first, so I can do an explanation or demo. Yeah, is this model good enough? Yeah, I kind of feel like it's getting more comprehensive. It goes through various models that are internationally recognized and used by thousands, and turns it into a process. But I kind of feel like we lost the values card element. And maybe we can find a way of seeing them as the same thing. I like the two wings analogy, it makes me feel like it's connecting to both Taoism and Islam. And I'm wondering how choiceless action fits into all of this. But I think maybe that's like a stretch goal, to get someone to feel like they just are, you know, but that's it. Like, I really believe that, you know, thoughts lead to actions, action leads to habits, and habits lead to destiny or character. And so if we find a way at deciding what new destiny we want, new character we want to be, then the actions we want to do will naturally emerge, or at least be way less resistant to them, we might still need reminders, but we can do them. And so I just want to make sure that that process is kind of incorporated here. And the idea that we don't want to change the world, we want to become wise and change ourselves and realize that in that way, we are going to change the world and the world doesn't. Don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come to life, because the world needs people that have come to life. And for me, that means knowing and living and continually refining a life led towards meaning and values, which is the divine showing through the portals of humans on earth. And it doesn't have to be a Muslim perspective, I really believe if people just live that way, and also were aware of the world and themselves and the dynamics and like the systems thinking and, you know, in this process, they would then think and be and live and do differently, right? They wouldn't be able to pollute anymore, once they started making these connections, for instance, and rather than telling people not to pollute, for instance, and then validate given the model I have, okay. That would hamper effectiveness. Do you see any major emissions? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, but the thing is, I gave it that list of CBT, CTE, polyvagal, Islamic spiritual psychology, I want to know what I don't know, I want you to be able to tell me like, oh, you forgot to think about that. Okay, what do you think? where are we at?"

              "content": "# Parliaments: A Heart-Centered Transformation System\n\n## I. Philosophical Foundation\n\n### Core Theory of Transformation\n\n#### A. The Becoming Cycle\n- Thoughts → Actions → Habits → Character → Destiny\n- Character emerges through consistent small choices\n- Actions align naturally when heart is clear\n- Resistance indicates patterns to explore\n\n#### B. Heart as Center\n- Heart acts as mirror reflecting deeper wisdom\n- Patterns/blocks can cloud this mirror\n- Transformation happens through \"polishing\" (clearing blocks)\n- Natural wisdom emerges when heart is clear\n\n#### C. Values Emergence\n- Values discovered through attention patterns\n- Emotions serve as signals pointing to values\n- Physical sensations offer wisdom\n- Values cards built naturally in background\n\n### Theoretical Frameworks Integration\n\n#### A. Two Wings\n1. Reflection Wing\n   - Self-awareness\n   - Pattern recognition\n   - Emotional intelligence\n   - Body wisdom\n\n2. Action Wing\n   - Small brave steps\n   - Consistent practice\n   - Real-world engagement\n   - Relationship building\n\n#### B. Four Quadrants\n1. Intrapersonal\n   - Mind states\n   - Emotional landscape\n   - Body awareness\n   - Energy levels\n\n2. Interpersonal\n   - Relationships\n   - Communications\n   - Social patterns\n   - Support needs\n\n3. Environmental\n   - Daily tasks\n   - Physical space\n   - Life contexts\n   - Practical needs\n\n4. Intentional\n   - Values alignment\n   - Life direction\n   - Purpose clarity\n   - Growth edges\n\n## II. System Architecture\n\n### A. Core Components\n\n#### 1. Daily Check-in Structure\n```javascript\nconst CHECKIN_TYPES = {\n  morning: {\n    required: ['energy', 'intention'],\n    optional: ['bodyAwareness', 'quickTasks']\n  },\n  evening: {\n    required: ['reflection', 'brainDump'],\n    optional: ['patterns', 'nextDay']\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Background Intelligence\n```javascript\nconst TRACKING_SYSTEM = {\n  values: {\n    observed: [],\n    evidence: {},\n    confidence: {}\n  },\n  patterns: {\n    recurring: [],\n    resistance: [],\n    breakthroughs: []\n  },\n  support: {\n    preferences: {},\n    history: {},\n    effectiveness: {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. User Configuration\n```javascript\nconst USER_CONFIG = {\n  interaction_style: {\n    tone: '',      // warm, direct, etc.\n    depth: '',     // light, medium, deep\n    frequency: ''  // check-in preferences\n  },\n  known_patterns: {\n    blocks: [],    // e.g., perfectionism\n    strengths: [], // what helps\n    edges: []      // growth areas\n  },\n  context: {\n    responsibilities: [], // family, work, etc.\n    goals: [],          // current focuses\n    support_network: [] // relationships\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### B. Interaction Flows\n\n#### 1. Morning Check-in\n- Quick energy level (1-5)\n- Optional body scan\n- Day's intention\n- Key tasks awareness\n- Keep under 2 minutes\n\n#### 2. Evening Check-in\n- Natural reflection\n- Brain dump opportunity\n- Pattern noticing (if relevant)\n- Next day preparation\n- Keep under 5 minutes\n\n#### 3. Deep Dive (Optional)\n- Triggered by user need\n- Pattern exploration\n- Values clarification\n- Action planning\n- Time flexible\n\n### C. Pattern Recognition System\n\n#### 1. Values Tracking\n```javascript\nclass ValuesTracker {\n  constructor() {\n    this.values = new Map();\n    this.evidence = new Map();\n    this.confidence = new Map();\n  }\n\n  updateValue(signal) {\n    // Extract value hints from:\n    // - Emotional responses\n    // - What naturally draws attention\n    // - What brings energy/aliveness\n    // - What feels meaningful\n  }\n\n  buildValuesCard(value) {\n    // Only when sufficient evidence\n    // Include confidence score\n    // Link to supporting moments\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Pattern Recognition\n```javascript\nclass PatternTracker {\n  constructor() {\n    this.patterns = new Map();\n    this.resistance = new Map();\n    this.breakthroughs = new Map();\n  }\n\n  trackPattern(interaction) {\n    // Notice:\n    // - Recurring themes\n    // - Resistance points\n    // - Breakthrough moments\n    // - Support preferences\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## III. Implementation Guidelines\n\n### A. Minimum Viable Product\n1. Basic daily check-in system\n2. Simple pattern recognition\n3. Values tracking backend\n4. User configuration storage\n\n### B. Key Principles\n1. Keep interactions light by default\n2. Allow natural depth when needed\n3. Track patterns without overwhelming\n4. Support brave actions\n5. Build trust through consistency\n\n### C. Technical Requirements\n1. Secure user data storage\n2. Reliable check-in mechanism\n3. Pattern recognition system\n4. Values tracking database\n5. Configuration management\n\n### D. Success Metrics\n1. User engagement consistency\n2. Pattern recognition accuracy\n3. Values emergence clarity\n4. Action completion rates\n5. User satisfaction/growth\n\n## IV. Future Considerations\n\n### A. Advanced Features\n1. Integration with human coaching\n2. Enhanced pattern recognition\n3. Deeper values exploration\n4. Community support features\n\n### B. Scaling Considerations\n1. Multi-user support\n2. Data privacy/security\n3. Performance optimization\n4. Platform expansion\n\n## V. Development Principles\n\n### A. Code Philosophy\n1. Simple over complex\n2. Natural over forced\n3. Flexible over rigid\n4. Growth",
