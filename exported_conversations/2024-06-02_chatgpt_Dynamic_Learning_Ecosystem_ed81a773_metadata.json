And then we were talking about doing something similar to that inside of the project that we're working on for the UN in Iraq, in MOSUL, in Mosul. And we were identifying also that the framework for education can also be the same process, use the same process to... identifying the learning stuff and identifying the framework needs for the system What is a higher level, a higher learning principle that will enable these ideas? There are some elements of clustering and cataloging, some elements of an adaptive framework that is involving some elements of concrete knowledge, starting with some concrete knowledge, but also allowing the knowledge to change and adapt itself and visualize the information and other things. What is the higher order idea underneath all of this? And then the badging, and then that badging having evidence is also related to this. We can think of not badges and evidence or credentials, but what is it that we can find that unites the assessments and the cataloging of knowledge and the evidence and the ideas that people present altogether?"

So, for instance, if you're taking an assessment, you might have four questions to help answer whether or not someone has a certain type of knowledge about budgeting, for instance. And how can you then identify the questions, most fundamental thing, and then can those things be broken up? What is the atomic unit? And, you know, the graph has all of these questions underneath this thing, and then all of them underneath some other things, and it can get really messy. How can we make it so that it's actually coherent, where the questions are actually meaningful in and of themselves? And, you know, when you take an assessment with the graph, you actually get to see what happens to all of the meta concepts above those questions. So, for instance, the question that talks about budgeting will probably answer some other knowledge around mathematics that you probably need to have in terms of some very basic arithmetic. And so, not only do you know budgeting, but you know arithmetic. And can this graph kind of roll up and pull out that information? What is the technical approach that would be able to efficiently pull out that knowledge from the knowledge graph about the knowledge that people have and how you cluster things?"
