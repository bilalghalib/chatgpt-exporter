I love their language on spending the next 5 years figuring out how to compost... \n\n\"Although rare in the UK, the kind of radical re-imagining of charitable funding announced by Lankelly Chase is more common in the US where, experts say, “decolonising the endowment” is a much more active debate in philanthropic and community circles.\"\n\nI have two parts of me, one part wonders what happens to system dynamics when accumulted funds are disbursed like this, I'd like to see models of flow and dissipation ... I'm imagining a dam bursting(although probably not accurate given their deliberate composting approach). And also the idea that that part of my mind is also a part of the colonial bean counting approach. That there's a new way forward based on trust, narrative, and uncalcuated generosity. \n\nDoes anyone know of some resources that relate to this second way that I could read? \n\n\"",

This comes as an intriguing response to concerns raised in 'Winners Take All' and similar critiques about the efficacy of impact investment and philanthropy. \n\nThrilled by the language Lankelly Chase uses as they embark on a 5-year journey to 'compost', a unique concept with promising potential.\n\n\"In the UK, it's relatively rare to see such a radical re-imagination of charitable funding as Lankelly Chase has proposed. In contrast, the US is said to have a much more active debate on 'decolonising the endowment' within philanthropic and community circles.\" \n\nI find myself drawn in two directions - On one hand, I'm intrigued by the system dynamics when large funds are disbursed in this manner. I would love to explore models that illustrate the flow and potential dissipation of resources. \n\nYet, I realize this thought process might be reflective of the conventional, 'colonial' approach of monitoring and controlling resources. There seems to be a shift towards a new narrative - one based on trust, storytelling, and a generosity that defies calculation.\n\nI'm actively seeking resources that delve into this alternative approach. Does anyone have any recommendations?",

Adding an expression of gratitude towards Jessamyn Shams-Lau for bringing the topic to your attention also enhances the interactive nature of the post. You effectively communicate the complexity of your thoughts and the dichotomy of your perspective, inviting others to engage in the conversation. I suggest a minor edit for clarity and flow:\n\nWow - I've just stumbled upon an intriguing example of \"colonizer endowments\" dismantling.\n\nYears ago, after reading \"Winners Take All,\" I found myself grappling with how to address the critiques of the impact investment/philanthropy sector, particularly as my organization is a beneficiary of such funds. \n\nThe approach by Lankelly Chase caught my attention, particularly their idea of spending the next 5 years figuring out how to \"compost\" their accumulated wealth. Trustee Marai Larasi articulated that it's “time to compost” the institution and foster the emergence of new ones, aimed not at sustaining the \"cult of benevolence,\" but at truly dismantling it.\n\nIt's noteworthy that such radical re-imaginations of charitable funding are not commonplace in the UK, whereas in the US, the notion of 'decolonising the endowment' actively stirs debates among philanthropy and community circles.\n\nThis has me musing in two directions. On one hand, I'm intrigued by the system dynamics when large funds are dismantled and disseminated in this fashion. I'm keen to explore models illustrating the flow, potential dissipation, and the various paths these resources might take.\n\nHowever, the realization hits that this thought process might just be a relic of the colonial mindset - obsessively counting beans and striving for control. Maybe there's an alternative route forward, one that veers away from stringent calculations and instead relies on trust, emergence, and stories. A path defined by unconditional generosity, unfettered by numerical boundaries.\n\nDoes anyone have insights or resources related to this more qualitative, trust-based, unconditional approach to dismantling and distribution of resources? Any leads would be immensely appreciated.\n\nBig thanks to Jessamyn Shams-Lau for putting this on my radar...",
