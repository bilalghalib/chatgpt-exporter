What would your alternate story be? What lessons could you learn from your alternate path?\nValues: If you had to choose a core value that is least associated with your current venture, what would it be, and how might incorporating this value into your business lead to unexpected outcomes or opportunities in Lebanon? You can take and review your Character Strengths assessment to understand your character strengths and values better.\nLearning Goals: What are your top three personal and professional learning goals at this stage in your career?\nModes of Learning: Think of a skill essential to your venture's success that you could learn from an unexpected source (e.g., an elderly neighbor, the chouf trees, or a traditional craftsperson).

Take the Universal Skills assessment to learn more about your skills.\nObstacles and Challenges: Imagine the biggest challenges facing your social enterprise today were miraculously solved, how did that happen and what new challenges have taken their place?\nGrowth Areas: Which aspects of your social enterprise’s growth and development are you most directly involved in or responsible for?\nImpact: If you had to measure the social impact of your venture using unconventional or qualitative indicators (e.g., stories of personal transformation, community pride), how might you assess your success, and what new insights might you gain?\nStakeholder Engagement: Picture a future where your venture achieves its goals in a completely different way than you initially imagined.

      "content": "\n\nOverall, the questions in this Orientation Journal V0.1 are well-written and thought-provoking, designed to encourage self-reflection and exploration of different perspectives. However, there are a few areas for improvement:\n\n- The questions could be more specific to the context of Lebanon and its social and economic challenges. While some questions reference Lebanon, others could apply to any social enterprise in any country.\n- The questions on assessments (Character Strengths, Universal Skills, ECAT, Wellbeing Assessment) could benefit from more explanation about how they relate to the overall orientation journal and what insights they might provide.\n\nHere are some specific critiques of each question:\n\n- Origin Story: This question is a bit vague and could benefit from more specific guidance on what \"entirely different way\" means. It's also not clear what the \"same challenge\" is that the social enterprise is addressing. However, the idea of exploring alternate paths and learning from them is valuable.\n- Values: This question is well-structured and provides a clear prompt to think about incorporating a new core value into the venture. However, it could be more specific to Lebanon and its context.\n- Learning Goals: This question is straightforward and provides a useful opportunity to reflect on personal and professional growth. However, it could be more specific to the context of the social enterprise and its goals.\n- Modes of Learning: This question is creative and encourages thinking outside the box for learning opportunities. However, it could benefit from more guidance on how the learning experience would contribute to personal and professional growth.\n- Obstacles and Challenges: This question is interesting and encourages thinking about future challenges that might arise even if current obstacles are solved. However, it could be more specific to the context of the social enterprise and its goals.\n- Growth Areas: This question is well-structured and provides a clear prompt to think about growth areas. However, it could be more specific to the context of the social enterprise and its goals.\n- Impact: This question is valuable in encouraging thinking beyond traditional quantitative measures of impact. However, it could benefit from more guidance on what specific unconventional or qualitative indicators to use.\n- Stakeholder Engagement: This question is thought-provoking and encourages thinking about alternative approaches to achieving goals. However, it could be more specific to the context of the social enterprise and its goals.\n- Well-being and Growth Insights: This question is valuable in encouraging reflection on personal well-being and growth. However, it could benefit from more guidance on how to harness unexpected strengths or improve in areas for growth.",
