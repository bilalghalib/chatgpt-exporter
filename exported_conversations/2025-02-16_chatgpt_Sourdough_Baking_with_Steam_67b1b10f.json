      "content": "Baking sourdough with a water tray helps create steam, which improves oven spring and gives you a crispier crust. Here’s how you can do it with your setup:\n\n### **Baking Sourdough with a Water Tray**  \n\n#### **1. Preheat Your Oven**  \n- You mentioned your oven is at **250°C (482°F)**—this is good for baking sourdough.  \n- If your oven has a baking stone or steel, preheat it for at least **30-45 minutes** to ensure even heat.  \n\n#### **2. Prepare the Water Tray**  \n- Place an empty metal tray on the bottom rack while the oven preheats.  \n- Right before putting your dough in, pour **1 cup of boiling water** into the tray. This creates steam, helping the bread expand in the first 15-20 minutes.\n\n#### **3. Baking Time & Temperature**  \n- **First 20 minutes**: Bake at **250°C** with the water tray for steam. This helps with oven spring.  \n- **After 20 minutes**: Remove the water tray (or just let the water evaporate).  \n- **Reduce heat to 220-230°C (428-446°F)** and bake for another **20-25 minutes** until deep golden brown.  \n- If you want an extra crispy crust, keep the oven slightly open for the last 5 minutes to let moisture escape.  \n\n#### **4. Cooling**  \n- Let the bread cool on a wire rack for **at least 1 hour** before cutting. This prevents it from being gummy inside.  \n\n#### **Bonus Tip**  \nIf you want **extra steam**, you can also:\n- Spray the oven walls with water when placing the dough inside.  \n- Use an upside-down metal bowl or a Dutch oven to trap steam if available.  \n\nLet me know if you want adjustments! 🚀",
