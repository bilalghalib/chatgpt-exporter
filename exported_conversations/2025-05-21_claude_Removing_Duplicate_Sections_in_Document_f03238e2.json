Executive Summary\nThe BEIT project (Building Equitable & Inclusive Transformation) set out to design a short-form, job-linked solar-energy curriculum for Mosul that would:\nTransfer technical competence (PV sizing, safe installation, maintenance).\nForge direct pathways to employment through employer-judged assessments and internships.\nIntegrate sales engineering and quality standards through client empathy so graduates can sell solutions, not just hardware.\n\n\nBetween 14 April and 21 May 2025, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews, two focus-group sessions, and ongoing WhatsApp consultations with local trainers, installers, lenders, heritage architects, and government officials. The process generated >400 coded excerpts and 71 quantitative datapoints (e.g., typical course length, contact-hours, prevailing wages) .\n\nFrames the unique angle of the short modules as \"sales engineering\" capabilities that combine technical knowledge with understanding client needs\nReframes training as community formation rather than content delivery\nIntegrates market actors directly into the classroom through employer-judged projects\nCreates tangible pathways to employment through internships and real-world projects\nReconnects modern sustainability practices with Iraqi heritage and traditional wisdom\nThis report documents our engagement process, synthesizes key insights, and presents a framework for implementing training modules that reflect these principles. By centering local expertise and market realities, we aim to create not just skilled technicians, but empowered problem-solvers who can drive Mosul's sustainable reconstruction.\n1.1 Key Findings\nDomain\nWhat Stakeholders Said\nDesign Implication\nPedagogy\n“Learners remember by doing” – Saud Maan\nKeep ≥70 % hands-on; start every block with a physical task.\nMeasurement culture\n“Iraqis speak in amps, not kWh.” – Hussam Falih\nAll load worksheets begin in amps; kW shown only for BOM.\nQuality & safety gaps\nDC polarity errors → fires; fake warranties rife. – Ali Abkan\nAdd DC/AC burn-wire demo + inverter tear-down & warranty myth-bust.\nBusiness fit\nUp-front cost is top barrier; clients decide on ROI not specs. – Mustafa Waleed, Muayad Hasan\nWeave finance into every day; introduce “sales-engineer” roleplay blocks.\nEmployment pathway\n“The exam is the interview with a company.” – Mohammed Al-Qatan\nDay 6 = employer-judged build-off + mock interview; internship MoUs signed on stage.\n\n1.2 Core Recommendations\nAdopt a six-day boot-camp structure proven credible by benchmark analysis yet short enough for wage-earners to attend (Table 3, p. 12).\nEmbed “sales engineering”—combining ROI calculators, story-selling, and heritage aesthetics—throughout the technical blocks.\nEmployment bridge: Five local installers have agreed in principle to host two-month subsidised internships for top graduates; letters of intent to be signed by 2 June 2025 .\nMonitoring & adaptation: Daily sticky-note reflections feed into a living curriculum log; quarterly alumni surveys will inform module tweaks.\n\n\n\n2 Stakeholder Identification & Mapping\n2.1 Roles & Potential Contributions\nStakeholder Group\nValue to Programme\n“Quick win” Engagement Offer (confirmed)\nInstallers (5 firms)\nRealistic QA standards; internships\nJudge Day 6 build-off; sign MoUs for 2-month placements\nSuppliers (3 brands)\nAuthentic components; product training\nDonate demo stock; co-logo certificates; pitch at Solar Festival\nFinance partners (2 banks)\nDebt instruments matched to ROI models\nGuest panel Day 5; fast-track loan desk during festival\nHeritage architects (4 experts)\nPassive-cooling insights; capstone mentors\nProvide rooftop orientation case-studies; review student designs\nGovernment (MoLSA / MoE)\nRecognition; loan-scheme linkage\nEndorse syllabus; list graduates on employment portal\nInternational certifier (RENAC)\nGlobal credibility\nExternal assessor Day 6; CPD credits\n\n2.2 Local experts\nThe following individuals were recommended as local trainers or subject-matter experts by Mosul-based partners (especially Mosul Space) and outreach from Solar Iraq.

Key partners include:\n\n\nStakeholder Ecosystem Map\nThe following diagram shows all key partners in our BEIT solar training program in Mosul, putting trainees at the center and showing how they connect with everyone who helps them succeed.\nStakeholder\nRole\nContribution to Training\nTrainees\nCentral beneficiaries\nLearning, peer support, market research\nMaster & Assistant Trainers\nTechnical instructors\nHands-on skills, quality standards, mentorship\nSolar Installation Firms\nEmployers & field partners\nJob opportunities, site visits, competition judges\nEquipment Suppliers\nHardware providers\nDemo materials, technical specifications, pricing data\nGovernment Agencies\nRegulatory framework\nStandards certification, financing programs\nInternational Certifiers\nQuality assurance\nRENAC certification, global best practices\nFinance Actors\nInvestment catalysts\nMicro-financing, business planning, ROI templates\nCommunity Clients\nEnd users\nReal-world problems, field testing, feedback\nAlumni Network\nPeer supporters\nMentorship, job referrals, ongoing learning\nHeritage Architects\nCultural integrators\nTraditional design principles, sustainable adaptation\n\nThis approach shows that good training isn't just about teaching facts; it's about building a community that connects skills to real job opportunities.\n3 Engagement Process Documentation\n(This section spells out how we gathered the evidence that shapes every recommendation, and why we chose to focus first on the solar module while laying the ground-work for insulation and architecture.)\n3.1 What this document is & why solar came first\nUnder the ITC Terms of Reference the first output is a “documented engagement of stakeholders” for curriculum validation by 15 May 2025 .\n We deliberately concentrated Phase-1 outreach on the solar domain because:\nMarket pull: PV represents ~70 % of all rebuilding-related green-tech purchases in Mosul today, dwarfing demand for insulation or architectural retrofits ( interview average) \nWork-plan alignment: The modular training calendar approved by ITC starts with Module 1 “Solar Energy & System Design” before rolling into insulation and architecture (see weeks 1-6 in the Modular Workplan) .\nDepth before breadth: Understanding one domain in granular detail created a template for developing methods both for training development, as well as interview processing and insights extraction (load audit ⇄ heat-loss audit, roof shading ⇄ passive-cooling etc.) that will accelerate curriculum design for the other two modules .\nWhile solar was in the spotlight, we still opened dialogue with insulation and architecture actors (five preliminary calls logged) so that subsequent modules can piggy-back on established relationships .\n4. Documentation of Interviews\nThe following table contains the highlights of the interviews and a short summary of the content that was merged into our module. A complete analysis can be found in the annex: \nSession ID\nDate (2025)\nParticipants\nCondensed meeting notes – key points raised\nValidated recommendations (already fed into Module 1)\nINT-01\n14 May\nBilal ↔ Hussam Falih – Enterprise-Development Specialist, OXFAM\nIraqi trainees think in amps, not kWh. DC-cable spec & breaker sizing often ignored → fires. Dust neglect biggest performance killer; needs demo. Up-front cost is the main adoption barrier → link to Ministry-of-Labour loans. Sun-path finder is the best quick shade tool.\nAdd amp-based load worksheet (Day 1). 45-min DC vs AC wiring safety lab (Day 2). Live \"dirty-vs-clean\" watt demo + panel-cleaning SOP (Day 5). Purchase two sun-path finders; embed exercise (Day 4). Invite a micro-loan officer to Day 6 careers panel.\nINT-02\n14 May\nBilal ↔ Muayad Hasan – RENAC Master-Trainer\nUses PVsyst extensively; advocates simulation before field work. Story-based teaching; ends each day with a trainee review circle & anonymous sticky notes. Dust cleaning must avoid midday wash in summer. Poor mounting structures fail in wind; need structural calcs.\n90-min PVsyst demo + 20 trial licences (Day 3). Daily 15-min review circle + sticky-note feedback. Include dust-clean ROI discussion inside maintenance block (Day 5). Add structural load worksheet & torque-wrench practical (Day 4).\nINT-03\n16 May\nBilal ↔ Ali Abkan – Technical Support Engineer, Chisage ESS\nCredibility depends on certificates co-signed by major brands (Gisage, Huawei). Proposes \"tear-down & compare\" cheap vs premium inverters to show quality. Market flooded with fake 10-year warranties. Datasheet literacy and battery–inverter compatibility critical.\nSecure brand co-logo for certificates. Add 3-inverter tear-down lab (Day 2–3). Myth-busting slide on fake warranties (Day 2). Datasheet scavenger-hunt worksheet (Day 2). Compatibility tables & firmware-pairing demo (Day 3).\nINT-04\n18 May\nBilal ↔ Saud Maan – Lecturer, College of Electrical Engineering & Engineer, Dijla Office\nLearners \"remember by doing\" – keep theory < 20%. Suggests system-assembly competition judged by employers. Idea: host \"Solar Festival\" linking trainees to 10–15 Mosul companies. Common errors: SPD wiring, DC-polarity swaps, inverter programming.\nDay 6 installation competition with local firms on the judging panel. Add troubleshooting tasks on SPD, polarity & programming. Plan \"Solar Festival\" showcase two weeks after course. Negotiate 2-month paid internships with installers.\nINT-05\n18 May\nBilal ↔ Mohammed Al-Qatan – Director, Mosul Solar Co.\nWants Day 1 to start hands-on inverter tear-down; theory woven later (70% lab). Emphasises datasheet reading to stop costly mistakes. String-sizing errors burn fuses; needs calculator exercise. Advocates mock job interviews as assessment.\nFlip Day 1 agenda: tear-down first then concepts. Insert datasheet reading hunt (Day 1–2). Add string-sizing calculator + fuse-blow demo (Day 3). Schedule mock interviews with three PV firms in afternoon Day 6.\nINT-06\n19 May\nBilal ↔ Mustafa Waleed (Mosul Space / Electrical-office partner)\n4-engineer office supplies PV kits, fire & PLC systems. Main clients: large farm pumps (day-only, no battery) and residential users. Biggest failure he sees: batteries thrown in hot, dusty store-rooms; life drops fast. Needs a cool, clean spot even if cables get longer. Hybrid inverters cost ≈ + US $1,000; commercial pay-back < 2 years; residential 6-8 yrs (dep. on loads). Stresses reading datasheet \"critical rows\" (max PV V, battery V).\nAdd mini-module on battery placement & ventilation; include cable-sizing for remote packs. Put a quick exercise on finding Voc, Vmax, Vbat in an Arabic/English datasheet. Brief comparison case-study: Off-grid vs Hybrid vs On-grid ROI for household vs farm pump.\nINT-07\n20 May\nBilal ↔ Dr Nasih Hma Salah (PhD nanoscience, RENAC Master-Trainer, component supplier)\nUses Bologna method – always frame session & learning goals. Since 2019 has run 30-day TOT courses; 100% job-placement claim for 30 alumni. Recommends 2 days of factory / company visits and homework on market-price collection. Suggests limiting scope to small residential PV (≈150 m² homes) for a 6-day course; skip ag/industrial to stay realistic. Proposes subsidised 2-month internships after course (company gains free helper, trainee gains experience). Highlights ethics: quality standards, \"good niyya\", fix building leaks before adding PV. Notes solar-water-heater intro can be taught in 3 days as a lower-barrier track.\nInsert half-day market-price scavenger task + template; debrief on Day 5 business block. Keep course strictly on small-residential PV; place \"industrial & ag extensions\" in Annex. Add bullet in Section 7 on internship pipeline (link to Saud's pathway idea). Open every day with a 2-min \"session framing\" slide.\n\n\n5. Quantitative Data Points\nStudy of Solar Training Lengths from Interviewed Participants\n1. \"Real-life\" durations the trainers have actually used\n(pulled verbatim from the transcripts – initials in brackets)\n#\nTrainer / Org.\nYear mentioned\nTypical course pattern they delivered\nHours per contact-day\nTotal contact-hours\nTheir slide / delivery preference\n1\nDr Nasih H. – Nanoscience Lab (Baghdad)\n2019\n30 calendar days – 2 h every other day (\"كان أول تدريب… 30 يوم… ساعتين يوم بعد يوم\")\n2 h\n≈ 30 h\nMinimum slides; prefers lab work then PDF hand-outs for self-study\n2\nDr Nasih H. – updated idea\n2025\n7 days straight (\"إلا خ سبع أيام… نجدد سبعة أيام\")\n5 h\n≈ 35 h\nWants Arabic slides + video snippets; no more than 6 bullets per slide\n3\nHussam F. – Oxfam / RENAC ToT\n2023-24\n4 days, 09:00-13:00 (\"أربع أيام هو بالعادة يصير تقريباً من التسعة للوحدة\")\n4 h\n16 h\nPicture-heavy PPT, < 20 slides total; relies on flip-chart teach-backs\n4\nMohammed Q. – Mosul Solar\n2022-24\n6 days full-time (\"ستة أيام… أول شي نبدأ وياهم…\")\n6 h\n≈ 36 h\n\"No theory slides before touching hardware\" – uses photos only\n5\nMuayad H. – RENAC master-trainer\n2024\n3-month online + 14-day hands-on in Germany (RENAC model); Iraqi refreshers are 5-day, 6 h blocks\n6 h\n30 h\n50:50 split – technical schematics + live PVsyst demo; decks capped at 25 slides\n6\nSaud M. – Digital Solar Co.\n2023\nAd-hoc 5 days, 5 h (focus on pumps & hybrid)\n5 h\n25 h\nPrefers interactive Google-Slide deck w/ live datasheet links\n7\nAli A. – Chisage ESS\n2024\nUsually joins other providers' 4- or 5-day courses as brand specialist (2-h battery block)\n—\n—\n8-slide tear-down deck + one live inverter\n\nMedian length across the eight data-points: 5 days (range 4 → 30).\nWhile the range of days is large, the number of contact hours, 30, is similar to our proposed training.\nThe design of the curriculum, post discussion and adaptation is compared below to available training modules, and to the discussions we’ve had with our stakeholders to determine the appropriateness, the likelihood of their enthusiasm for training the material, and the possibility of being run within a 6 day time frame. We want to thank Mosul Solar and KESK for supporting us with their knowledge and content. \n2.

For example:\n\"A homeowner in Al-Muhandiseen has purchased low-cost batteries that failed after 8 months. They now want a new system with reliable components but are concerned about the higher upfront cost. What technical specifications would you check to ensure quality, and how would you make the financial case for better components?\"\nTrainees record their initial answers individually, providing a baseline for their current knowledge.\nPost-Module Application\nAt the end of each module, trainees revisit the same scenario, revising their answers based on what they've learned. The trainer then facilitates a group discussion comparing the before and after responses, highlighting key learning points.\nThis approach:\nCreates a \"real-world\" context for abstract concepts\nIntegrates technical knowledge with sales and financial literacy\nMakes assessment practical rather than theoretical\nDemonstrates visible progress to trainees\nIdentifies areas for further reinforcement\n8. Consolidated Qualitative Insights\nFrom our interviews with trainers and stakeholders, five key thematic clusters emerged that will shape our training approach:\n8.1 Sales Engineering: A Core Competency\nMultiple stakeholders emphasized that technical skill alone doesn't ensure success in Mosul's solar market which requires awareness and visibility on the possibilities and benefits of green home retrofitting and desing. We've developed the concept of \"Sales Engineering\" as a distinct competency that combines technical knowledge with customer empathy and financial literacy. This approach:\nReframes solar technicians as problem-solvers who align solutions with client priorities (Mustafa Waleed highlighted a client whose primary concern was \"making sure his coffee machine works\")\nEquips graduates with tools to demonstrate ROI and lifetime value (Ali Abkan: \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper\")\nTeaches how to use social proof and local success stories rather than technical specifications to persuade customers (Hussam Falih: \"We always tell them person X installed it... this really encourages them\")\nDevelops skills to present technical information in accessible terms using local metaphors and examples\nThis competency will be integrated throughout the curriculum rather than treated as a separate module, reflecting its foundational importance to success in the Mosul market.\n6.2. Module Interdependency: The Energy Ecosystem Approach\nOur stakeholder engagement revealed that solar, insulation, and architecture should not be be made aware of the other dimensions. There are possibilities that panels provide insulation and that insulation reduces the number of batteries you need(cost savings!) as isolated domains but as interconnected components of a unified energy ecosystem. This insight transforms our approach to all three modules:\nModule\nFocus Area\nInterconnection Points\nSolar\nElectrical energy flows, system sizing, power generation\n- Solar panels provide roof shading, reducing cooling loads\n- System sizing requirements decrease with proper insulation\n- Proper architectural orientation affects panel placement and efficiency\nInsulation\nThermal envelope, heat transfer, material selection\n- Reduces HVAC loads, allowing smaller solar systems\n- Extends equipment life by reducing operating hours\n- Creates healthier indoor environments (reduced illness)\nArchitecture\nTraditional wisdom, passive cooling, spatial orientation\n- Window placement affects natural lighting needs<br>- Courtyard designs create natural ventilation<br>- Mosul heritage designs naturally regulate temperature\n\nWe're developing cross-module exercises that demonstrate these interconnections quantitatively (e.g., calculating how much smaller a solar system can be when paired with proper insulation).\n6.3. Dr. Nasih's Solar Water Heater 3-Day Module\nDr. Nasih Hma Salah, a RENAC Master Trainer since 2019 with approximately 14 years of solar experience, proposed an innovative approach to expand market entry points. His recommendation for a condensed 3-day solar water heater training (these are notes from our transcription indicating this: DN-HV-5, DN-HV-14) offers several strategic advantages:\nLower barrier to entry: Solar water heaters require less technical knowledge than PV systems, making them accessible to a broader range of participants including plumbers and general contractors\nMarket gap opportunity: Dr. Nasih identified this as an underserved market segment in Mosul with significant potential\nCost efficiency: Solar thermal systems typically cost less than PV, offering customers an affordable first step into solar energy\nComplementary skills: Thermal system installation develops transferable skills in solar orientation, mounting, and customer assessment that support later PV training\nWe propose developing this as a standalone module that can either serve as an entry point for those without electrical backgrounds or as a specialization for PV graduates looking to expand their service offerings.\n6.4. Capstone Project: Real-World Design Challenge\nStakeholders consistently emphasized the importance of authentic assessment through real-world projects. The capstone project approach combines several key recommendations:\nMohammed Al-Qatan's suggestion for mock job interviews as final assessment (MQ-HV-6)\nSaud Maan's proposal for an installation competition judged by potential employers (SM-HV-7)\nDr. Nasih's emphasis on solving actual client problems (DN-HV-8)\nSeveral trainers' recommendation that each participant design a system for their own home\nThe capstone structure includes:\nEach trainee selects a real site (their home, relative's business, etc.) with ≤150m² roof area (following Dr. Nasih's recommendation to focus on small residential)\nThey develop a complete system design including load calculation, component selection, mounting plan, and financial analysis\nOn Day 6, they present this design to a panel of local employers in a mock job interview format scoring their efforts and developing relationships with the \nTop performers, groups or projects may be invited to participate in the \"Solar Festival\" showcase event (SM-HV-8)\nThis approach creates a direct bridge between training and employment while ensuring skills are applied to authentic local contexts.\n6.5 Consolidated Solar Training Principles(with Trainer Initials for Cited Insights — aligned to Deliverable 1 TOR)\n#\nPrinciple\nWhat it Means in Practice\nKey Evidence\n1\nHands-on First, Theory Second\n≥ 70% of every module is practical: trainees crimp, torque, mount, commission and troubleshoot before any slide deck.\n\"We don't have anything called theory; we are all practical work.\" – MA-HV-17\n2\nDatasheet & Spec-Sheet Literacy\nEvery new component is introduced with a bilingual walk-through of its datasheet; quizzes require trainees to match specs across panels, inverters and batteries.\n\"The most important thing is the datasheet.\" – AA-HV-04\n3\nDC Safety is Non-Negotiable\nDedicated 45-minute lab on DC vs AC wiring, breaker and fuse rating, arc-fault risks; only DC-rated parts allowed in demos.\n\"DC cable & breaker spec ignored in Iraq, causing fires.\" – MA-HV-17\n4\nLocal Context Integration\nAll loads expressed in amps, not kWh; price sheets, case-studies and failure photos are Mosul-specific;

Executive Summary\n\nThe BEIT project (Building Equitable & Inclusive Transformation) set out to design a short-form, job-linked solar-energy curriculum for Mosul that would:\n- Transfer technical competence (PV sizing, safe installation, maintenance).\n- Forge direct pathways to employment through employer-judged assessments and internships.\n- Integrate sales engineering and quality standards through client empathy so graduates can sell solutions, not just hardware.\n\nBetween 14 April and 21 May 2025, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews, two focus-group sessions, and ongoing WhatsApp consultations with local trainers, installers, lenders, heritage architects, and government officials. The process generated >400 coded excerpts and 71 quantitative datapoints (e.g., typical course length, contact-hours, prevailing wages).\n\nOur stakeholder interviews have transformed our approach from a conventional training model to an ecosystem-building strategy that:\n1. Frames the unique angle of the short modules as \"sales engineering\" capabilities that combine technical knowledge with understanding client needs\n2. Reframes training as community formation rather than content delivery\n3. Integrates market actors directly into the classroom through employer-judged projects\n4. Creates tangible pathways to employment through internships and real-world projects\n5. Reconnects modern sustainability practices with Iraqi heritage and traditional wisdom\n\nThis report documents our engagement process, synthesizes key insights, and presents a framework for implementing training modules that reflect these principles. By centering local expertise and market realities, we aim to create not just skilled technicians, but empowered problem-solvers who can drive Mosul's sustainable reconstruction.\n\n### 1.1 Key Findings\n\n| Domain | What Stakeholders Said | Design Implication |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Pedagogy | \"Learners remember by doing\" – Saud Maan | Keep ≥70% hands-on; start every block with a physical task. |\n| Measurement culture | \"Iraqis speak in amps, not kWh.\" – Hussam Falih | All load worksheets begin in amps; kW shown only for BOM. |\n| Quality & safety gaps | DC polarity errors → fires; fake warranties rife. – Ali Abkan | Add DC/AC burn-wire demo + inverter tear-down & warranty myth-bust. |\n| Business fit | Up-front cost is top barrier; clients decide on ROI not specs. – Mustafa Waleed, Muayad Hasan | Weave finance into every day; introduce \"sales-engineer\" roleplay blocks. |\n| Employment pathway | \"The exam is the interview with a company.\" – Mohammed Al-Qatan | Day 6 = employer-judged build-off + mock interview; internship MoUs signed on stage. |\n\n### 1.2 Core Recommendations\n\n- Adopt a six-day boot-camp structure proven credible by benchmark analysis yet short enough for wage-earners to attend (Table 3, p. 12).\n- Embed \"sales engineering\"—combining ROI calculators, story-selling, and heritage aesthetics—throughout the technical blocks.\n- Employment bridge: Five local installers have agreed in principle to host two-month subsidised internships for top graduates; letters of intent to be signed by 2 June 2025.\n- Monitoring & adaptation: Daily sticky-note reflections feed into a living curriculum log; quarterly alumni surveys will inform module tweaks.\n\n## 2 Stakeholder Identification & Mapping\n\n### 2.1 Roles & Potential Contributions\n\n| Stakeholder Group | Value to Programme | \"Quick win\" Engagement Offer (confirmed) |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Installers (5 firms) | Realistic QA standards; internships | Judge Day 6 build-off; sign MoUs for 2-month placements |\n| Suppliers (3 brands) | Authentic components; product training | Donate demo stock; co-logo certificates; pitch at Solar Festival |\n| Finance partners (2 banks) | Debt instruments matched to ROI models | Guest panel Day 5; fast-track loan desk during festival |\n| Heritage architects (4 experts) | Passive-cooling insights; capstone mentors | Provide rooftop orientation case-studies; review student designs |\n| Government (MoLSA / MoE) | Recognition; loan-scheme linkage | Endorse syllabus; list graduates on employment portal |\n| International certifier (RENAC) | Global credibility | External assessor Day 6; CPD credits |\n\n### 2.2 Local experts\n\nThe following individuals were recommended as local trainers or subject-matter experts by Mosul-based partners (especially Mosul Space) and outreach from Solar Iraq. Availability and suitability were assessed based on technical knowledge, facilitation skills, and availability.\n\n### 2.3 Interviewed Local Experts from Mosul\n\n| Name | Module | Tech skill | Training skill | Training availability | Interviewed |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Hussam Falih | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Muayad Hasan | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Ali Abkan | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | — | 🟩 |\n| Mohammed Al-Qatan | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | — | 🟩 |\n| Saud Maan | Solar | ✓ | △ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Mustafa Waleed | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | — | 🟩 |\n| Dr Nasih Hma Salah | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Ghassan | Insulation | ✓ | △ | — | 🟩 |\n| Muthanna Al-Mashhadani | Insulation | ✓ | △ | — | 🟩 |\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | ✓ | △ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n| Ahmed Al-Obaidy | Architecture | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | 🟩 |\n| Laith Abdulla | Architecture | ✓ | △ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n| Fatima Eyad | Architecture | ✓ | △ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Larsa Emad | Architecture | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n| Yahia Al-Fakhry | Architecture | ✓ | △ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n\n## Stakeholder Ecosystem Map\n\nThis map shows how our training works within a support network that helps trainees get quality education and real jobs. Key partners include:\n\n**Stakeholder Classification:**\n\n1. **Government Agencies and International Certifiers** set standards, provide funding, and offer official recognition.  \n2. **Master & Assistant Trainers** teach hands-on skills using proven methods.  \n3. **Finance/Micro-Credit groups** help with business planning and show how solar investments pay off.  \n4. **Heritage Architects** bring traditional Mosul building wisdom to modern solar solutions.  \n5. **Equipment Suppliers** provide real components for practice and ensure quality installations.  \n6. **Community Clients (customers)** offer real problems to solve, letting trainees practice on actual homes.  \n7. **Solar Installation Firms** host field trips, offer jobs, and share practical knowledge.  \n8. **Alumni Network** creates ongoing support among graduates.\n\nThis approach shows that good training isn't just about teaching facts, it's about building a community that connects skills to real job opportunities.\n\n| Stakeholder | Role | Contribution to Training |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Trainees | Central beneficiaries | Learning, peer support, market research |\n| Master & Assistant Trainers | Technical instructors | Hands-on skills, quality standards, mentorship |\n| Solar Installation Firms | Employers & field partners | Job opportunities, site visits, competition judges |\n| Equipment Suppliers | Hardware providers | Demo materials, technical specifications, pricing data |\n| Government Agencies | Regulatory framework | Standards certification, financing programs |\n| International Certifiers | Quality assurance | RENAC certification, global best practices |\n| Finance Actors | Investment catalysts | Micro-financing, business planning, ROI templates |\n| Community Clients | End users | Real-world problems, field testing, feedback |\n| Alumni Network | Peer supporters | Mentorship, job referrals, ongoing learning |\n| Heritage Architects | Cultural integrators | Traditional design principles, sustainable adaptation |\n\n## 3 Engagement Process Documentation\n\n(This section spells out how we gathered the evidence that shapes every recommendation, and why we chose to focus first on the solar module while laying the ground-work for insulation and architecture.)\n\n### 3.1 What this document is & why solar came first\n\nUnder the ITC Terms of Reference the first output is a \"documented engagement of stakeholders\" for curriculum validation by 15 May 2025.\n\nWe deliberately concentrated Phase-1 outreach on the solar domain because:\n- Market pull: PV represents ~70% of all rebuilding-related green-tech purchases in Mosul today, dwarfing demand for insulation or architectural retrofits (interview average)\n- Work-plan alignment: The modular training calendar approved by ITC starts with Module 1 \"Solar Energy & System Design\" before rolling into insulation and architecture (see weeks 1-6 in the Modular Workplan).\n- Depth before breadth: Understanding one domain in granular detail created a template for developing methods both for training development, as well as interview processing and insights extraction (load audit ⇄ heat-loss audit, roof shading ⇄ passive-cooling etc.) that will accelerate curriculum design for the other two modules.\n\nWhile solar was in the spotlight, we still opened dialogue with insulation and architecture actors (five preliminary calls logged) so that subsequent modules can piggy-back on established relationships.\n\n## 4. Documentation of Interviews\n\nThe following table contains the highlights of the interviews and a short summary of the content that was merged into our module. A complete analysis can be found in the annex:\n\n| Session ID | Date (2025) | Participants | Condensed meeting notes – key points raised | Validated recommendations (already fed into Module 1) |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| INT-01 | 14 May | Bilal ↔ Hussam Falih – Enterprise-Development Specialist, OXFAM | Iraqi trainees think in amps, not kWh. DC-cable spec & breaker sizing often ignored → fires. Dust neglect biggest performance killer; needs demo. Up-front cost is the main adoption barrier → link to Ministry-of-Labour loans. Sun-path finder is the best quick shade tool. | Add amp-based load worksheet (Day 1). 45-min DC vs AC wiring safety lab (Day 2). Live \"dirty-vs-clean\" watt demo + panel-cleaning SOP (Day 5). Purchase two sun-path finders; embed exercise (Day 4). Invite a micro-loan officer to Day 6 careers panel. |\n| INT-02 | 14 May | Bilal ↔ Muayad Hasan – RENAC Master-Trainer | Uses PVsyst extensively; advocates simulation before field work. Story-based teaching; ends each day with a trainee review circle & anonymous sticky notes. Dust cleaning must avoid midday wash in summer. Poor mounting structures fail in wind; need structural calcs. | 90-min PVsyst demo + 20 trial licences (Day 3). Daily 15-min review circle + sticky-note feedback. Include dust-clean ROI discussion inside maintenance block (Day 5). Add structural load worksheet & torque-wrench practical (Day 4). |\n| INT-03 | 16 May | Bilal ↔ Ali Abkan – Technical Support Engineer, Chisage ESS | Credibility depends on certificates co-signed by major brands (Gisage, Huawei). Proposes \"tear-down & compare\" cheap vs premium inverters to show quality. Market flooded with fake 10-year warranties. Datasheet literacy and battery–inverter compatibility critical. | Secure brand co-logo for certificates. Add 3-inverter tear-down lab (Day 2–3). Myth-busting slide on fake warranties (Day 2). Datasheet scavenger-hunt worksheet (Day 2). Compatibility tables & firmware-pairing demo (Day 3). |\n| INT-04 | 18 May | Bilal ↔ Saud Maan – Lecturer, College of Electrical Engineering & Engineer, Dijla Office | Learners \"remember by doing\" – keep theory < 20%. Suggests system-assembly competition judged by employers. Idea: host \"Solar Festival\" linking trainees to 10–15 Mosul companies. Common errors: SPD wiring, DC-polarity swaps, inverter programming. | Day 6 installation competition with local firms on the judging panel. Add troubleshooting tasks on SPD, polarity & programming. Plan \"Solar Festival\" showcase two weeks after course. Negotiate 2-month paid internships with installers. |\n| INT-05 | 18 May | Bilal ↔ Mohammed Al-Qatan – Director, Mosul Solar Co. | Wants Day 1 to start hands-on inverter tear-down; theory woven later (70% lab). Emphasises datasheet reading to stop costly mistakes. String-sizing errors burn fuses; needs calculator exercise. Advocates mock job interviews as assessment. | Flip Day 1 agenda: tear-down first then concepts. Insert datasheet reading hunt (Day 1–2). Add string-sizing calculator + fuse-blow demo (Day 3). Schedule mock interviews with three PV firms in afternoon Day 6. |\n| INT-06 | 19 May | Bilal ↔ Mustafa Waleed (Mosul Space / Electrical-office partner) | 4-engineer office supplies PV kits, fire & PLC systems. Main clients: large farm pumps (day-only, no battery) and residential users. Biggest failure he sees: batteries thrown in hot, dusty store-rooms; life drops fast. Needs a cool, clean spot even if cables get longer. Hybrid inverters cost ≈ + US $1,000; commercial pay-back < 2 years; residential 6-8 yrs (dep. on loads). Stresses reading datasheet \"critical rows\" (max PV V, battery V). | Add mini-module on battery placement & ventilation; include cable-sizing for remote packs. Put a quick exercise on finding Voc, Vmax, Vbat in an Arabic/English datasheet. Brief comparison case-study: Off-grid vs Hybrid vs On-grid ROI for household vs farm pump. |\n| INT-07 | 20 May | Bilal ↔ Dr Nasih Hma Salah (PhD nanoscience, RENAC Master-Trainer, component supplier) | Uses Bologna method – always frame session & learning goals. Since 2019 has run 30-day TOT courses; 100% job-placement claim for 30 alumni. Recommends 2 days of factory / company visits and homework on market-price collection. Suggests limiting scope to small residential PV (≈150 m² homes) for a 6-day course; skip ag/industrial to stay realistic. Proposes subsidised 2-month internships after course (company gains free helper, trainee gains experience). Highlights ethics: quality standards, \"good niyya\", fix building leaks before adding PV. Notes solar-water-heater intro can be taught in 3 days as a lower-barrier track. | Insert half-day market-price scavenger task + template; debrief on Day 5 business block. Keep course strictly on small-residential PV; place \"industrial & ag extensions\" in Annex. Add bullet in Section 7 on internship pipeline (link to Saud's pathway idea). Open every day with a 2-min \"session framing\" slide. |\n\n## 5. Quantitative Data Points\n\n### Study of Solar Training Lengths from Interviewed Participants\n\n#### 1. \"Real-life\" durations the trainers have actually used\n(pulled verbatim from the transcripts – initials in brackets)\n\n| # | Trainer / Org. | Year mentioned | Typical course pattern they delivered | Hours per contact-day | Total contact-hours | Their slide / delivery preference |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 | Dr Nasih H. – Nanoscience Lab (Baghdad) | 2019 | 30 calendar days – 2 h every other day (\"كان أول تدريب… 30 يوم… ساعتين يوم بعد يوم\") | 2 h | ≈ 30 h | Minimum slides; prefers lab work then PDF hand-outs for self-study |\n| 2 | Dr Nasih H. – updated idea | 2025 | 7 days straight (\"إلا خ سبع أيام… نجدد سبعة أيام\") | 5 h | ≈ 35 h | Wants Arabic slides + video snippets; no more than 6 bullets per slide |\n| 3 | Hussam F. – Oxfam / RENAC ToT | 2023-24 | 4 days, 09:00-13:00 (\"أربع أيام هو بالعادة يصير تقريباً من التسعة للوحدة\") | 4 h | 16 h | Picture-heavy PPT, < 20 slides total; relies on flip-chart teach-backs |\n| 4 | Mohammed Q. – Mosul Solar | 2022-24 | 6 days full-time (\"ستة أيام… أول شي نبدأ وياهم…\") | 6 h | ≈ 36 h | \"No theory slides before touching hardware\" – uses photos only |\n| 5 | Muayad H. – RENAC master-trainer | 2024 | 3-month online + 14-day hands-on in Germany (RENAC model); Iraqi refreshers are 5-day, 6 h blocks | 6 h | 30 h | 50:50 split – technical schematics + live PVsyst demo; decks capped at 25 slides |\n| 6 | Saud M. – Digital Solar Co. | 2023 | Ad-hoc 5 days, 5 h (focus on pumps & hybrid) | 5 h | 25 h | Prefers interactive Google-Slide deck w/ live datasheet links |\n| 7 | Ali A. – Chisage ESS | 2024 | Usually joins other providers' 4- or 5-day courses as brand specialist (2-h battery block) | — | — | 8-slide tear-down deck + one live inverter |\n\nMedian length across the eight data-points: **5 days** (range 4 → 30).\nWhile the range of days is large, the number of contact hours, 30, is similar to our proposed training.\n\n### 2. How our proposed Lean 6-day boot-camp lines up\n\nThe design of the curriculum, post discussion and adaptation is compared below to available training modules, and to the discussions we've had with our stakeholders to determine the appropriateness, the likelihood of their enthusiasm for training the material, and the possibility of being run within a 6 day time frame. We want to thank Mosul Solar and KESK for supporting us with their knowledge and content.\n\n| Cluster & Activity | Our Lean 6-day | Already in Mosul Solar | Already in KESK | \"Voices\" who asked for it |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Load audit in amps + value story | Day 1 – amps worksheet + café case | ✗ | ✗ | H.F., S.M. |\n| Hands-on component tear-down | Day 1 – touch then talk | ✓ | ✓ | M.Q., A.A. |\n| Datasheet-hunt + fake-vs-real | Day 2 | ~ (light) | ✓ | A.A., H.F. |\n| Battery / CC / Inverter sizing in amps | Day 2-3 | ✓ | ✓ | A.A., M.Q. |\n| DC vs AC safety lab (burned-wire demo) | Day 3 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F. |\n| Full BOS protection & grounding | Day 3 | ✓ | ✓ | M.Q. |\n| Shade/path-finder & wind-load calc | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F., M.H. |\n| Mount-up & torque-wrench practice | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | M.Q. |\n| Cleaning ROI + O&M contract | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F. |\n| ROI spreadsheet + sales pitch | Day 5 | ✗ | ✗ | A.A., S.M., BG |\n| Market-research street survey (30 interviews) | Day 5 p.m. | ✗ | ✗ | H.F. |\n| System assembly competition | Day 6 a.m. | ✗ | ✓ (partial) | M.Q., H.F. |\n| Mock interviews & employer panel | Day 6 p.m. | ✗ | ✗ | M.Q., BG |\n\n**What overlaps?**\n- Core sizing maths, component taxonomy, mounting practice – all three programmes share them.\n- Our plan diverges by grafting finance + customer-empathy + post-sale care (none of which KESK or Mosul Solar discuss directly).\n\n**What are we still missing relative to peers?**\n\n| Gap vs peers | Source that does cover it | Mitigation inside 6 days? |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Deep PV-physics & advanced cell tech (PERC, bifacial) | KESK | Do we need further training on 2-h micro-MOOC link |\n| Extended data-logging / SCADA commissioning / Maintenance! | KESK | 1-h optional Day 6 add-on or Day 7 mini-module |\n| Formal MCS / IEC standards mapping | KESK slide pack | 20-min standards dash in Day 3 safety block |\n| Simulated design in PVsyst | Muayad RENAC | Light-touch demo Day 5, plus self-study licence list |\n\n### 3. Is six days still credible after hearing the trainers?\n\n- **Hussam F.** – says 4-day is doable if 09-13 only theory + quick labs.\n- **Mohammed Q.** – built his own 6-day full-time course and is comfortable.\n- **Muayad H.** – prefers 5 or 10 full days but agrees you can \"hit the basics\" in 6 \"if the kit is ready and class is max 4 groups.\"\n- **Dr Nasih** – longest view (30 d); concedes a 7-day intensive is \"acceptable\" so long as evenings free for homework.\n\n**Review decision**: Six days is going to be quite busy, packed days is the lower edge of comfort but feasible if:\n1. Gear is pre-wired & labelled (saves 90 min).\n2. Evening micro-tasks (video or spreadsheet) offload some theory.\n3. Class size ≤ 20, four rigs.\n\n## 6. Foundational Pedagogy: The Four-Block Structure\n\nBased on feedback from trainers, each day of our program follows a consistent four-block structure that creates natural rhythm while maximizing engagement:\n\n| Block | Time | Purpose | Expanded Description |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Touch** | Morning<br>(9:30-11:00) | Exploration & Discussion | Trainees physically handle components, observe demonstrations, and discuss what they notice before formal instruction. Mohammed Al-Qatan (MQ-HV-1) emphasized starting with hands-on inverter examination on Day 1 rather than theory. |\n| **Decode** | Mid-Morning<br>(11:15-12:45) | Technical Analysis | Trainees learn to interpret datasheets, safety guidelines, and design parameters, making evidence-based decisions. Ali Abkan (AA-HV-2) stressed datasheet literacy as critical for preventing costly mistakes. |\n| **Do** | After Lunch<br>(1:45-3:15) | Applied Practice | Trainees build, wire, configure or troubleshoot real systems, applying morning concepts to practical tasks. Saud Maan (SM) noted that learners \"remember by doing\" with minimal theory. |\n| **Reflect** | Late Afternoon<br>(3:30-4:00) | Integration & Feedback | Daily reflection using Muayad's sticky-note method (MH-HV-13) where participants anonymously share what they learned, connecting technical skills to market realities. |\n\nThis structure repeatedly emerged from stakeholder feedback as ideal for maintaining engagement in Mosul's climate while respecting local learning preferences.\n\n### Pedagogic Pillars\n\n| Pedagogic Pillar | Concrete Classroom Practice | Local Source* |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Facilitated, not delivered | Trainer circulates, asks coaching questions; learners do 70% of the talking/doing. | BG (Bilal Ghalib) |\n| Flipped & Chunked | 10-min input → 50-min micro-sprint → 10-min peer debrief; four blocks/day. | BG |\n| Problem-First / Empathy | Every activity starts with a live customer scenario (cousin's roof, café freezer, farm pump). | H.F. & S.M. |\n| Visible Standards | Three color-coded wall checklists: Safety, Datasheet-Match, Quality-Control. | A.A. |\n| Peer Teaching | End of each block, one team \"teach-back\" on a spec, tool or checklist step. | H.F. |\n| Daily Reflection Loop | 15-min sticky-wall (names optional); trainer photos for M&E & next-day tweak. | M.H. |\n| Care & Mind-set | Open each morning with a 3-min \"customer-care story\" linking quality to reputation. | BG |\n\n*H.F. = Hussam Falih, S.M. = Saud Maan, A.A. = Ali Abkan, M.H. = Muayad Hasan, M.W. = Mustafa Waleed, D.N. = Dr. Nasih, BG = Bilal Ghalib\n\n## 7. Training Program Structure and Content Overview\n\nThe program follows a consistent daily structure based on the \"4-block methodology\" developed from local expert input:\n\n### Program Structure Overview\n\n| Day | Focus Area | Key Activities | Learning Outcomes | Expert Insight |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Day 1 | Solar Fundamentals & Hands-on Equipment | • Hands-on component examination<br>• Load calculation in amperes<br>• Financial value proposition basics<br>• Home energy audit | • Identify solar components<br>• Calculate load in amperes<br>• Assess site suitability<br>• Begin financial literacy | \"Iraqi homeowners speak in amps, not kWh. Provide amp-based load worksheet before converting to kW.\" - Hussam |\n| Day 2 | System Components & Wiring | • Inverter examination & teardown<br>• DC vs. AC principles & safety<br>• Battery basics<br>• Wire sizing & protection | • Select appropriate inverters<br>• Size wires correctly<br>• Understand electrical safety<br>• Calculate component costs | \"DC is not as forgiving as AC, any wrong with polarity is a disaster.\" - Saud |\n| Day 3 | System Integration & Datasheet Reading | • Component compatibility<br>• Series vs. parallel connections<br>• Protection devices<br>• Vendor price research | • Connect components correctly<br>• Install protection devices<br>• Read technical datasheets<br>• Create accurate Bill of Materials | \"The most important thing is the datasheet. Read the datasheet of the devices before you work.\" - Ali |\n| Day 4 | Mounting Systems & Site Visits | • Structural calculations<br>• Mounting hardware<br>• Site visit<br>• Installation challenges | • Calculate wind loads<br>• Install mounting systems<br>• Learn from real installations<br>• Present to customers | \"I've seen panels that move, meaning the entire rack moves with the wind.\" - Mohammed |\n| Day 5 | System Design & Business Skills | • System design software<br>• Financial calculations<br>• Market research<br>• Maintenance planning | • Design complete systems<br>• Calculate ROI<br>• Develop business strategies<br>• Create service packages | \"Each person designs a complete solar system from A to Z.\" - Hussam |\n| Day 6 | Assessment & Job Connection | • System assembly competition<br>• Final project presentations<br>• Mock job interviews<br>• Certification | • Demonstrate installation skills<br>• Present system designs<br>• Interview successfully<br>• Connect with employers | \"Real interviews. Because in the end, the experience will teach them.\" - Mohammed |\n\n### Integrated Assessment Approach\n\nThis program uses an innovative assessment approach that integrates technical knowledge with financial literacy:\n\n**Pre-Module Scenarios**\nAt the start of each module, trainees receive a brief realistic scenario that presents both a technical challenge and a financial decision. For example:\n\n\"A homeowner in Al-Muhandiseen has purchased low-cost batteries that failed after 8 months. They now want a new system with reliable components but are concerned about the higher upfront cost. What technical specifications would you check to ensure quality, and how would you make the financial case for better components?\"\n\nTrainees record their initial answers individually, providing a baseline for their current knowledge.\n\n**Post-Module Application**\nAt the end of each module, trainees revisit the same scenario, revising their answers based on what they've learned. The trainer then facilitates a group discussion comparing the before and after responses, highlighting key learning points.\n\nThis approach:\n- Creates a \"real-world\" context for abstract concepts\n- Integrates technical knowledge with sales and financial literacy\n- Makes assessment practical rather than theoretical\n- Demonstrates visible progress to trainees\n- Identifies areas for further reinforcement\n\n### Module Integration Recommendations\n(Solar Module 1 – 6-day boot-camp mapped directly to stakeholder evidence)\n\n| Day | Learning outcomes (validated need) | Anchor activity | Stakeholder evidence driving design | Core kit & resources |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 – Fundamentals + Load Audit | • express every household load in amps and amp-hours<br>• link generator cost → solar ROI | Component \"touch-tour\" (open inverter, battery, panel) → coffee-shop amp worksheet | \"Most people think about electricity in amperes, not kilowatts.\" – Hussam Falih<br>• \"We don't have anything called theory; we're all practical work.\" – Mohammed Al-Qatan | 4 demo inverters (1 faulty), power meters, amp-worksheet pads, generator-price chart |\n| 2 – Components, DC vs AC Safety | • match inverter ↔ battery specs<br>• size DC cable & breakers<br>• recognise counterfeit parts | Inverter tear-down lab → DC burn-wire demo | \"DC is not as forgiving as AC; any wrong with polarity is a disaster.\" – Saud Maan<br>• \"The most important thing is the datasheet – read it.\" – Ali Abkan | 8 genuine & 8 fake MC4 sets, torque wrenches, SPD samples, laminated datasheets |\n| 3 – Strings & Protection | • build 120 V/360 V strings safely<br>• size surge & fuse protection | 4-panel string-builder game → breaker-board wiring | \"Sometimes they neglect connecting the SPD.\" – Saud Maan<br>• Mohammed reports frequent over-voltage faults (string-inverter mismatch) | adjustable roof-rig, DIN rails, multimeters, string-calc cards |\n| 4 – Mounting & Environment | • calculate wind load<br>• torque fasteners<br>• shade-pathfinder use | Roof-rack torque race → site visit | \"Solar panels fall because of poor mounting.\" – Mohammed Al-Qatan | two roof mock-ups, digital pathfinder, anemometer, cracked-cell demo panel |\n| 5 – Design, Finance & Sales | • complete PVsyst design<br>• compute ROI & TCO<br>• craft customer pitch | Street-survey + ROI spreadsheet → sales role-play | \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper.\" – Ali Abkan<br>• \"Generator prices have doubled this year.\" – Saud Maan | 10 laptops w/ PVsyst, ROI templates, generator-cost dataset, role-play cards |\n| 6 – Capstone Build-off & Job Bridge | • assemble 4-panel hybrid system<br>• defend design in employer interview | Employer-judged build-off + mock interviews | \"The exam is the interview.\" – Mohammed Al-Qatan<br>• Saud's idea for installation competition | 4 full 4-panel rigs, interview rubrics, internship MoU letters |\n\n### Why this 6-day arc meets every insight\n- Hands-on first – 70% practical blocks honour Mohammed's \"no paper & pen\" rule.\n- Amp language – every sizing sheet begins in amps, converting to kW only for the Bill-of-Materials, directly tackling Hussam's observation of generator billing norms.\n- Sales-engineering thread – each technical exercise ends with a cash-story (generator vs solar, cheap vs premium inverter) echoing Ali's insistence on financial literacy.\n- Failure-as-teacher – daily \"bugged rig\" or photo-failure ice-breakers respond to Muayad's view that mistakes are the fastest teacher.\n\n### Cross-module bridges (solar ↔ insulation ↔ architecture)\nOn Day 4 students calculate how a white-roof paint job cuts panel temperature by 6°C, shrinking mismatch losses by ~2%—a live example of the \"energy ecosystem\" Dr Nasih championed. Homework asks them to re-size the array if the same house were insulated to 0.4 W/m²K, reinforcing load-reduction parallels for the forthcoming insulation module.\n\n### Trainer deployment & class logistics\nOne master trainer (Mohammed or Muayad) + 2 assistants handle four parallel stations; max 20 trainees as per Muayad's structure note. Rotation every 90 min keeps all stations busy; assistants run safety checkpoints with a red-tag / green-tag QC drill recommended by Saud. Gamified recap – a 10-question Kahoot at 15:30 daily satisfies trainer Waleed's engagement tip.\n\n## 8. Consolidated Qualitative Insights\n\nFrom our interviews with trainers and stakeholders, five key thematic clusters emerged that will shape our training approach:\n\n### 8.1 Sales Engineering: A Core Competency\n\nMultiple stakeholders emphasized that technical skill alone doesn't ensure success in Mosul's solar market which requires awareness and visibility on the possibilities and benefits of green home retrofitting and design. We've developed the concept of \"Sales Engineering\" as a distinct competency that combines technical knowledge with customer empathy and financial literacy. This approach:\n\n- Reframes solar technicians as problem-solvers who align solutions with client priorities (Mustafa Waleed highlighted a client whose primary concern was \"making sure his coffee machine works\")\n- Equips graduates with tools to demonstrate ROI and lifetime value (Ali Abkan: \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper\")\n- Teaches how to use social proof and local success stories rather than technical specifications to persuade customers (Hussam Falih: \"We always tell them person X installed it... this really encourages them\")\n- Develops skills to present technical information in accessible terms using local metaphors and examples\n\nThis competency will be integrated throughout the curriculum rather than treated as a separate module, reflecting its foundational importance to success in the Mosul market.\n\n### 8.2. Module Interdependency: The Energy Ecosystem Approach\n\nOur stakeholder engagement revealed that solar, insulation, and architecture should not be be made aware of the other dimensions. There are possibilities that panels provide insulation and that insulation reduces the number of batteries you need(cost savings!) as isolated domains but as interconnected components of a unified energy ecosystem. This insight transforms our approach to all three modules:\n\n| Module | Focus Area | Interconnection Points |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Solar** | Electrical energy flows, system sizing, power generation | - Solar panels provide roof shading, reducing cooling loads<br>- System sizing requirements decrease with proper insulation<br>- Proper architectural orientation affects panel placement and efficiency |\n| **Insulation** | Thermal envelope, heat transfer, material selection | - Reduces HVAC loads, allowing smaller solar systems<br>- Extends equipment life by reducing operating hours<br>- Creates healthier indoor environments (reduced illness) |\n| **Architecture** | Traditional wisdom, passive cooling, spatial orientation | - Window placement affects natural lighting needs<br>- Courtyard designs create natural ventilation<br>- Mosul heritage designs naturally regulate temperature |\n\nWe're developing cross-module exercises that demonstrate these interconnections quantitatively (e.g., calculating how much smaller a solar system can be when paired with proper insulation).\n\n### 8.3. Dr. Nasih's Solar Water Heater 3-Day Module\n\nDr. Nasih Hma Salah, a RENAC Master Trainer since 2019 with approximately 14 years of solar experience, proposed an innovative approach to expand market entry points. His recommendation for a condensed 3-day solar water heater training (these are notes from our transcription indicating this: DN-HV-5, DN-HV-14) offers several strategic advantages:\n\n- **Lower barrier to entry**: Solar water heaters require less technical knowledge than PV systems, making them accessible to a broader range of participants including plumbers and general contractors\n- **Market gap opportunity**: Dr. Nasih identified this as an underserved market segment in Mosul with significant potential\n- **Cost efficiency**: Solar thermal systems typically cost less than PV, offering customers an affordable first step into solar energy\n- **Complementary skills**: Thermal system installation develops transferable skills in solar orientation, mounting, and customer assessment that support later PV training\n\nWe propose developing this as a standalone module that can either serve as an entry point for those without electrical backgrounds or as a specialization for PV graduates looking to expand their service offerings.\n\n### 8.4. Capstone Project: Real-World Design Challenge\n\nStakeholders consistently emphasized the importance of authentic assessment through real-world projects. The capstone project approach combines several key recommendations:\n\n- Mohammed Al-Qatan's suggestion for mock job interviews as final assessment (MQ-HV-6)\n- Saud Maan's proposal for an installation competition judged by potential employers (SM-HV-7)\n- Dr. Nasih's emphasis on solving actual client problems (DN-HV-8)\n- Several trainers' recommendation that each participant design a system for their own home\n\nThe capstone structure includes:\n\n1. Each trainee selects a real site (their home, relative's business, etc.) with ≤150m² roof area (following Dr. Nasih's recommendation to focus on small residential)\n2. They develop a complete system design including load calculation, component selection, mounting plan, and financial analysis\n3. On Day 6, they present this design to a panel of local employers in a mock job interview format scoring their efforts and developing relationships with the \n4. Top performers, groups or projects may be invited to participate in the \"Solar Festival\" showcase event (SM-HV-8)\n\nThis approach creates a direct bridge between training and employment while ensuring skills are applied to authentic local contexts.\n\n### 8.5 Consolidated Solar Training Principles\n\n(with Trainer Initials for Cited Insights — aligned to Deliverable 1 TOR)\n\n| # | Principle | What it Means in Practice | Key Evidence |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 | **Hands-on First, Theory Second** | ≥ 70% of every module is practical: trainees crimp, torque, mount, commission and troubleshoot before any slide deck. | \"We don't have anything called theory; we are all practical work.\" – MA-HV-17 |\n| 2 | **Datasheet & Spec-Sheet Literacy** | Every new component is introduced with a bilingual walk-through of its datasheet; quizzes require trainees to match specs across panels, inverters and batteries. | \"The most important thing is the datasheet.\" – AA-HV-04 |\n| 3 | **DC Safety is Non-Negotiable** | Dedicated 45-minute lab on DC vs AC wiring, breaker and fuse rating, arc-fault risks; only DC-rated parts allowed in demos. | \"DC cable & breaker spec ignored in Iraq, causing fires.\" – MA-HV-17 |\n| 4 | **Local Context Integration** | All loads expressed in amps, not kWh; price sheets, case-studies and failure photos are Mosul-specific; dust, heat and unstable grid built into loss factors. | MA-HV-18, MA-HV-20, MA-HV-21 |\n| 5 | **Measure → Design → Install → Monitor Loop** | Trainees run a full cycle: site audit → PVsyst/HOMER simulation → 4-panel roof-rig installation → live monitoring & tuning. | \"Closed feedback loop: design → install → monitor → redesign.\" – SM-HV-02 |\n| 6 | **Learning-Through-Mistakes Library** | Daily \"failure photo\" ice-breaker plus a bugged demo-rig so trainees diagnose real wiring & mounting errors. | MA-HV-05, MA-HV-27 |\n| 7 | **Financial Storytelling & ROI** | Each technical task ends with a cash-flow or TCO illustration (generator amps vs solar, cheap vs premium inverter, O&M packages). | \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper.\" – AA-HV-08 |\n| 8 | **Daily Reflection with Named Sticky Notes** | End-of-day wall where trainees post \"One thing I learnt / found interesting / still unclear\" **with their name** to support M&E photo capture. | Adapted from MM-HV-15method; partner feedback requests names on notes |\n| 9 | **4-Station Group Rotation (4–5 pax)** | Parallel stations (mounting, wiring, simulation, battery QA) keep class size 20–24 active; friends separated to avoid dependency. | MM-HV-12 |\n| 10 | **Peer Teaching & Storytelling** | Micro-presentations: each learner teaches one device or local success story on a flip-chart to reinforce terminology. | SA-HV-25, Qual-12 |\n| 11 | **Visual over Written** | Flip-charts, annotated photos, live demos and Google-Earth walk-throughs replace long text; Arabic/English glossary posters stay on the wall. | Guide pedagogy section + MA-HV-13 |\n| 12 | **Pre / Post Scenario Assessment** | Scenario cards (technical *and* financial) answered at start and end of each day/module to evidence competence gains. | Guide M&E section |\n| 13 | **Quality-vs-Counterfeit Awareness** | Tear-down of cheap vs Tier-1 inverters, battery authenticity checklist, warranty verification drill. | AA-HV-10, AA-HV-14 |\n| 14 | **Employment & Entrepreneurship Pathway** | Mock interviews with local employers, internship MOUs, \"solar festival\" showcase, and micro-finance/loan briefing embedded in Day 6. | MA-HV-22, SA-HV-30, Guide employment plan |\n| 15 | **After-Sales & O&M Mind-set** | Module on cleaning schedules, service-contract templates and battery health checks; trainees draft an O&M offer during class. | MA-HV-20, MA-HV-28 |\n| 16 | **Simulation Before Field Work** | PVsyst (or free online) session precedes roof-rig practice; 20 trial licences budgeted. | SM-HV-01 |\n| 17 | **Accredited, Co-branded Certification** | Course certificate co-signed by RENAC/GISAGE & ITC; final assessment = safe 4-panel install + design & ROI report for trainee's own home. | AA-HV-06, certificate insight |\n| 18 | **Inclusive, Mixed-Ability Intake** | Entry screening ensures basic electrical numeracy, but activities pair stronger with emerging learners; bilingual materials support non-native English speakers. | Core principle 1 + AA-HV-07 |\n\n**Legend (Initials)**\n* MA: Mohammed Al Qatan\n* AA: Ali Al-Abbasi\n* SM: Saud Maan\n* MM: Muayad Muheisen\n* SA: Saud Al-Hadithi\n\n## 9.

Executive Summary\n2. Local Experts from Mosul\n3. Stakeholder Ecosystem Map\n4. Documentation of Interviews\n5. Quantitative Data Points\n6. Consolidated Qualitative Insights\n7. Training Program Structure and Content Overview\n8. Certification & Pathway Recommendations\n9. Next Steps & Deadlines\n10. Interview Coordination & Communication Channels\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\nThe BEIT project (Building Equitable & Inclusive Transformation) set out to design a short-form, job-linked solar-energy curriculum for Mosul that would:\n- Transfer technical competence (PV sizing, safe installation, maintenance).\n- Forge direct pathways to employment through employer-judged assessments and internships.\n- Integrate sales engineering and quality standards through client empathy so graduates can sell solutions, not just hardware.\n\nBetween 14 April and 21 May 2025, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews, two focus-group sessions, and ongoing WhatsApp consultations with local trainers, installers, lenders, heritage architects, and government officials. The process generated >400 coded excerpts and 71 quantitative datapoints (e.g., typical course length, contact-hours, prevailing wages).\n\nOur stakeholder interviews have transformed our approach from a conventional training model to an ecosystem-building strategy that:\n1. Frames the unique angle of the short modules as \"sales engineering\" capabilities that combine technical knowledge with understanding client needs\n2. Reframes training as community formation rather than content delivery\n3. Integrates market actors directly into the classroom through employer-judged projects\n4. Creates tangible pathways to employment through internships and real-world projects\n5. Reconnects modern sustainability practices with Iraqi heritage and traditional wisdom\n\nThis report documents our engagement process, synthesizes key insights, and presents a framework for implementing training modules that reflect these principles. By centering local expertise and market realities, we aim to create not just skilled technicians, but empowered problem-solvers who can drive Mosul's sustainable reconstruction.\n\n### 1.1 Key Findings\n\n| Domain | What Stakeholders Said | Design Implication |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Pedagogy | \"Learners remember by doing\" – Saud Maan | Keep ≥70% hands-on; start every block with a physical task. |\n| Measurement culture | \"Iraqis speak in amps, not kWh.\" – Hussam Falih | All load worksheets begin in amps; kW shown only for BOM. |\n| Quality & safety gaps | DC polarity errors → fires; fake warranties rife. – Ali Abkan | Add DC/AC burn-wire demo + inverter tear-down & warranty myth-bust. |\n| Business fit | Up-front cost is top barrier; clients decide on ROI not specs. – Mustafa Waleed, Muayad Hasan | Weave finance into every day; introduce \"sales-engineer\" roleplay blocks. |\n| Employment pathway | \"The exam is the interview with a company.\" – Mohammed Al-Qatan | Day 6 = employer-judged build-off + mock interview; internship MoUs signed on stage. |\n\n### 1.2 Core Recommendations\n\n- Adopt a six-day boot-camp structure proven credible by benchmark analysis yet short enough for wage-earners to attend (Table 3, p. 12).\n- Embed \"sales engineering\"—combining ROI calculators, story-selling, and heritage aesthetics—throughout the technical blocks.\n- Employment bridge: Five local installers have agreed in principle to host two-month subsidised internships for top graduates; letters of intent to be signed by 2 June 2025.\n- Monitoring & adaptation: Daily sticky-note reflections feed into a living curriculum log; quarterly alumni surveys will inform module tweaks.\n\n## 2 Stakeholder Identification & Mapping\n\n### 2.1 Roles & Potential Contributions\n\n| Stakeholder Group | Value to Programme | \"Quick win\" Engagement Offer (confirmed) |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Installers (5 firms) | Realistic QA standards; internships | Judge Day 6 build-off; sign MoUs for 2-month placements |\n| Suppliers (3 brands) | Authentic components; product training | Donate demo stock; co-logo certificates; pitch at Solar Festival |\n| Finance partners (2 banks) | Debt instruments matched to ROI models | Guest panel Day 5; fast-track loan desk during festival |\n| Heritage architects (4 experts) | Passive-cooling insights; capstone mentors | Provide rooftop orientation case-studies; review student designs |\n| Government (MoLSA / MoE) | Recognition; loan-scheme linkage | Endorse syllabus; list graduates on employment portal |\n| International certifier (RENAC) | Global credibility | External assessor Day 6; CPD credits |\n\n### 2.2 Local experts\n\nThe following individuals were recommended as local trainers or subject-matter experts by Mosul-based partners (especially Mosul Space) and outreach from Solar Iraq. Availability and suitability were assessed based on technical knowledge, facilitation skills, and availability.\n\n### 2.3 Interviewed Local Experts from Mosul\n\n| Name | Module | Tech skill | Training skill | Training availability | Interviewed |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Hussam Falih | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Muayad Hasan | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Ali Abkan | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | — | 🟩 |\n| Mohammed Al-Qatan | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | — | 🟩 |\n| Saud Maan | Solar | ✓ | △ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Mustafa Waleed | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | — | 🟩 |\n| Dr Nasih Hma Salah | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Ghassan | Insulation | ✓ | △ | — | 🟩 |\n| Muthanna Al-Mashhadani | Insulation | ✓ | △ | — | 🟩 |\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | ✓ | △ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n| Ahmed Al-Obaidy | Architecture | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | 🟩 |\n| Laith Abdulla | Architecture | ✓ | △ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n| Fatima Eyad | Architecture | ✓ | △ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Larsa Emad | Architecture | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n| Yahia Al-Fakhry | Architecture | ✓ | △ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n\n## Stakeholder Ecosystem Map\n\nThis map shows how our training works within a support network that helps trainees get quality education and real jobs. Key partners include:\n\n**Stakeholder Classification:**\n\n1. **Government Agencies and International Certifiers** set standards, provide funding, and offer official recognition.  \n2. **Master & Assistant Trainers** teach hands-on skills using proven methods.  \n3. **Finance/Micro-Credit groups** help with business planning and show how solar investments pay off.  \n4. **Heritage Architects** bring traditional Mosul building wisdom to modern solar solutions.  \n5. **Equipment Suppliers** provide real components for practice and ensure quality installations.  \n6. **Community Clients (customers)** offer real problems to solve, letting trainees practice on actual homes.  \n7. **Solar Installation Firms** host field trips, offer jobs, and share practical knowledge.  \n8. **Alumni Network** creates ongoing support among graduates.\n\nThis approach shows that good training isn't just about teaching facts, it's about building a community that connects skills to real job opportunities.\n\n| Stakeholder | Role | Contribution to Training |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Trainees | Central beneficiaries | Learning, peer support, market research |\n| Master & Assistant Trainers | Technical instructors | Hands-on skills, quality standards, mentorship |\n| Solar Installation Firms | Employers & field partners | Job opportunities, site visits, competition judges |\n| Equipment Suppliers | Hardware providers | Demo materials, technical specifications, pricing data |\n| Government Agencies | Regulatory framework | Standards certification, financing programs |\n| International Certifiers | Quality assurance | RENAC certification, global best practices |\n| Finance Actors | Investment catalysts | Micro-financing, business planning, ROI templates |\n| Community Clients | End users | Real-world problems, field testing, feedback |\n| Alumni Network | Peer supporters | Mentorship, job referrals, ongoing learning |\n| Heritage Architects | Cultural integrators | Traditional design principles, sustainable adaptation |\n\n## 3 Engagement Process Documentation\n\n(This section spells out how we gathered the evidence that shapes every recommendation, and why we chose to focus first on the solar module while laying the ground-work for insulation and architecture.)\n\n### 3.1 What this document is & why solar came first\n\nUnder the ITC Terms of Reference the first output is a \"documented engagement of stakeholders\" for curriculum validation by 15 May 2025.\n\nWe deliberately concentrated Phase-1 outreach on the solar domain because:\n- Market pull: PV represents ~70% of all rebuilding-related green-tech purchases in Mosul today, dwarfing demand for insulation or architectural retrofits (interview average)\n- Work-plan alignment: The modular training calendar approved by ITC starts with Module 1 \"Solar Energy & System Design\" before rolling into insulation and architecture (see weeks 1-6 in the Modular Workplan).\n- Depth before breadth: Understanding one domain in granular detail created a template for developing methods both for training development, as well as interview processing and insights extraction (load audit ⇄ heat-loss audit, roof shading ⇄ passive-cooling etc.) that will accelerate curriculum design for the other two modules.\n\nWhile solar was in the spotlight, we still opened dialogue with insulation and architecture actors (five preliminary calls logged) so that subsequent modules can piggy-back on established relationships.\n\n## 4. Documentation of Interviews\n\nThe following table contains the highlights of the interviews and a short summary of the content that was merged into our module. A complete analysis can be found in the annex:\n\n| Session ID | Date (2025) | Participants | Condensed meeting notes – key points raised | Validated recommendations (already fed into Module 1) |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| INT-01 | 14 May | Bilal ↔ Hussam Falih – Enterprise-Development Specialist, OXFAM | Iraqi trainees think in amps, not kWh. DC-cable spec & breaker sizing often ignored → fires. Dust neglect biggest performance killer; needs demo. Up-front cost is the main adoption barrier → link to Ministry-of-Labour loans. Sun-path finder is the best quick shade tool. | Add amp-based load worksheet (Day 1). 45-min DC vs AC wiring safety lab (Day 2). Live \"dirty-vs-clean\" watt demo + panel-cleaning SOP (Day 5). Purchase two sun-path finders; embed exercise (Day 4). Invite a micro-loan officer to Day 6 careers panel. |\n| INT-02 | 14 May | Bilal ↔ Muayad Hasan – RENAC Master-Trainer | Uses PVsyst extensively; advocates simulation before field work. Story-based teaching; ends each day with a trainee review circle & anonymous sticky notes. Dust cleaning must avoid midday wash in summer. Poor mounting structures fail in wind; need structural calcs. | 90-min PVsyst demo + 20 trial licences (Day 3). Daily 15-min review circle + sticky-note feedback. Include dust-clean ROI discussion inside maintenance block (Day 5). Add structural load worksheet & torque-wrench practical (Day 4). |\n| INT-03 | 16 May | Bilal ↔ Ali Abkan – Technical Support Engineer, Chisage ESS | Credibility depends on certificates co-signed by major brands (Gisage, Huawei). Proposes \"tear-down & compare\" cheap vs premium inverters to show quality. Market flooded with fake 10-year warranties. Datasheet literacy and battery–inverter compatibility critical. | Secure brand co-logo for certificates. Add 3-inverter tear-down lab (Day 2–3). Myth-busting slide on fake warranties (Day 2). Datasheet scavenger-hunt worksheet (Day 2). Compatibility tables & firmware-pairing demo (Day 3). |\n| INT-04 | 18 May | Bilal ↔ Saud Maan – Lecturer, College of Electrical Engineering & Engineer, Dijla Office | Learners \"remember by doing\" – keep theory < 20%. Suggests system-assembly competition judged by employers. Idea: host \"Solar Festival\" linking trainees to 10–15 Mosul companies. Common errors: SPD wiring, DC-polarity swaps, inverter programming. | Day 6 installation competition with local firms on the judging panel. Add troubleshooting tasks on SPD, polarity & programming. Plan \"Solar Festival\" showcase two weeks after course. Negotiate 2-month paid internships with installers. |\n| INT-05 | 18 May | Bilal ↔ Mohammed Al-Qatan – Director, Mosul Solar Co. | Wants Day 1 to start hands-on inverter tear-down; theory woven later (70% lab). Emphasises datasheet reading to stop costly mistakes. String-sizing errors burn fuses; needs calculator exercise. Advocates mock job interviews as assessment. | Flip Day 1 agenda: tear-down first then concepts. Insert datasheet reading hunt (Day 1–2). Add string-sizing calculator + fuse-blow demo (Day 3). Schedule mock interviews with three PV firms in afternoon Day 6. |\n| INT-06 | 19 May | Bilal ↔ Mustafa Waleed (Mosul Space / Electrical-office partner) | 4-engineer office supplies PV kits, fire & PLC systems. Main clients: large farm pumps (day-only, no battery) and residential users. Biggest failure he sees: batteries thrown in hot, dusty store-rooms; life drops fast. Needs a cool, clean spot even if cables get longer. Hybrid inverters cost ≈ + US $1,000; commercial pay-back < 2 years; residential 6-8 yrs (dep. on loads). Stresses reading datasheet \"critical rows\" (max PV V, battery V). | Add mini-module on battery placement & ventilation; include cable-sizing for remote packs. Put a quick exercise on finding Voc, Vmax, Vbat in an Arabic/English datasheet. Brief comparison case-study: Off-grid vs Hybrid vs On-grid ROI for household vs farm pump. |\n| INT-07 | 20 May | Bilal ↔ Dr Nasih Hma Salah (PhD nanoscience, RENAC Master-Trainer, component supplier) | Uses Bologna method – always frame session & learning goals. Since 2019 has run 30-day TOT courses; 100% job-placement claim for 30 alumni. Recommends 2 days of factory / company visits and homework on market-price collection. Suggests limiting scope to small residential PV (≈150 m² homes) for a 6-day course; skip ag/industrial to stay realistic. Proposes subsidised 2-month internships after course (company gains free helper, trainee gains experience). Highlights ethics: quality standards, \"good niyya\", fix building leaks before adding PV. Notes solar-water-heater intro can be taught in 3 days as a lower-barrier track. | Insert half-day market-price scavenger task + template; debrief on Day 5 business block. Keep course strictly on small-residential PV; place \"industrial & ag extensions\" in Annex. Add bullet in Section 7 on internship pipeline (link to Saud's pathway idea). Open every day with a 2-min \"session framing\" slide. |\n\n## 5. Quantitative Data Points\n\n### Study of Solar Training Lengths from Interviewed Participants\n\n#### 1. \"Real-life\" durations the trainers have actually used\n(pulled verbatim from the transcripts – initials in brackets)\n\n| # | Trainer / Org. | Year mentioned | Typical course pattern they delivered | Hours per contact-day | Total contact-hours | Their slide / delivery preference |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 | Dr Nasih H. – Nanoscience Lab (Baghdad) | 2019 | 30 calendar days – 2 h every other day (\"كان أول تدريب… 30 يوم… ساعتين يوم بعد يوم\") | 2 h | ≈ 30 h | Minimum slides; prefers lab work then PDF hand-outs for self-study |\n| 2 | Dr Nasih H. – updated idea | 2025 | 7 days straight (\"إلا خ سبع أيام… نجدد سبعة أيام\") | 5 h | ≈ 35 h | Wants Arabic slides + video snippets; no more than 6 bullets per slide |\n| 3 | Hussam F. – Oxfam / RENAC ToT | 2023-24 | 4 days, 09:00-13:00 (\"أربع أيام هو بالعادة يصير تقريباً من التسعة للوحدة\") | 4 h | 16 h | Picture-heavy PPT, < 20 slides total; relies on flip-chart teach-backs |\n| 4 | Mohammed Q. – Mosul Solar | 2022-24 | 6 days full-time (\"ستة أيام… أول شي نبدأ وياهم…\") | 6 h | ≈ 36 h | \"No theory slides before touching hardware\" – uses photos only |\n| 5 | Muayad H. – RENAC master-trainer | 2024 | 3-month online + 14-day hands-on in Germany (RENAC model); Iraqi refreshers are 5-day, 6 h blocks | 6 h | 30 h | 50:50 split – technical schematics + live PVsyst demo; decks capped at 25 slides |\n| 6 | Saud M. – Digital Solar Co. | 2023 | Ad-hoc 5 days, 5 h (focus on pumps & hybrid) | 5 h | 25 h | Prefers interactive Google-Slide deck w/ live datasheet links |\n| 7 | Ali A. – Chisage ESS | 2024 | Usually joins other providers' 4- or 5-day courses as brand specialist (2-h battery block) | — | — | 8-slide tear-down deck + one live inverter |\n\nMedian length across the eight data-points: **5 days** (range 4 → 30).\nWhile the range of days is large, the number of contact hours, 30, is similar to our proposed training.\n\n### 2. How our proposed Lean 6-day boot-camp lines up\n\nThe design of the curriculum, post discussion and adaptation is compared below to available training modules, and to the discussions we've had with our stakeholders to determine the appropriateness, the likelihood of their enthusiasm for training the material, and the possibility of being run within a 6 day time frame. We want to thank Mosul Solar and KESK for supporting us with their knowledge and content.\n\n| Cluster & Activity | Our Lean 6-day | Already in Mosul Solar | Already in KESK | \"Voices\" who asked for it |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Load audit in amps + value story | Day 1 – amps worksheet + café case | ✗ | ✗ | H.F., S.M. |\n| Hands-on component tear-down | Day 1 – touch then talk | ✓ | ✓ | M.Q., A.A. |\n| Datasheet-hunt + fake-vs-real | Day 2 | ~ (light) | ✓ | A.A., H.F. |\n| Battery / CC / Inverter sizing in amps | Day 2-3 | ✓ | ✓ | A.A., M.Q. |\n| DC vs AC safety lab (burned-wire demo) | Day 3 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F. |\n| Full BOS protection & grounding | Day 3 | ✓ | ✓ | M.Q. |\n| Shade/path-finder & wind-load calc | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F., M.H. |\n| Mount-up & torque-wrench practice | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | M.Q. |\n| Cleaning ROI + O&M contract | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F. |\n| ROI spreadsheet + sales pitch | Day 5 | ✗ | ✗ | A.A., S.M., BG |\n| Market-research street survey (30 interviews) | Day 5 p.m. | ✗ | ✗ | H.F. |\n| System assembly competition | Day 6 a.m. | ✗ | ✓ (partial) | M.Q., H.F. |\n| Mock interviews & employer panel | Day 6 p.m. | ✗ | ✗ | M.Q., BG |\n\n**What overlaps?**\n- Core sizing maths, component taxonomy, mounting practice – all three programmes share them.\n- Our plan diverges by grafting finance + customer-empathy + post-sale care (none of which KESK or Mosul Solar discuss directly).\n\n**What are we still missing relative to peers?**\n\n| Gap vs peers | Source that does cover it | Mitigation inside 6 days? |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Deep PV-physics & advanced cell tech (PERC, bifacial) | KESK | Do we need further training on 2-h micro-MOOC link |\n| Extended data-logging / SCADA commissioning / Maintenance! | KESK | 1-h optional Day 6 add-on or Day 7 mini-module |\n| Formal MCS / IEC standards mapping | KESK slide pack | 20-min standards dash in Day 3 safety block |\n| Simulated design in PVsyst | Muayad RENAC | Light-touch demo Day 5, plus self-study licence list |\n\n### 3. Is six days still credible after hearing the trainers?\n\n- **Hussam F.** – says 4-day is doable if 09-13 only theory + quick labs.\n- **Mohammed Q.** – built his own 6-day full-time course and is comfortable.\n- **Muayad H.** – prefers 5 or 10 full days but agrees you can \"hit the basics\" in 6 \"if the kit is ready and class is max 4 groups.\"\n- **Dr Nasih** – longest view (30 d); concedes a 7-day intensive is \"acceptable\" so long as evenings free for homework.\n\n**Review decision**: Six days is going to be quite busy, packed days is the lower edge of comfort but feasible if:\n1. Gear is pre-wired & labelled (saves 90 min).\n2. Evening micro-tasks (video or spreadsheet) offload some theory.\n3. Class size ≤ 20, four rigs.\n\n## 6. Foundational Pedagogy: The Four-Block Structure\n\nBased on feedback from trainers, each day of our program follows a consistent four-block structure that creates natural rhythm while maximizing engagement:\n\n| Block | Time | Purpose | Expanded Description |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Touch** | Morning<br>(9:30-11:00) | Exploration & Discussion | Trainees physically handle components, observe demonstrations, and discuss what they notice before formal instruction. Mohammed Al-Qatan (MQ-HV-1) emphasized starting with hands-on inverter examination on Day 1 rather than theory. |\n| **Decode** | Mid-Morning<br>(11:15-12:45) | Technical Analysis | Trainees learn to interpret datasheets, safety guidelines, and design parameters, making evidence-based decisions. Ali Abkan (AA-HV-2) stressed datasheet literacy as critical for preventing costly mistakes. |\n| **Do** | After Lunch<br>(1:45-3:15) | Applied Practice | Trainees build, wire, configure or troubleshoot real systems, applying morning concepts to practical tasks. Saud Maan (SM) noted that learners \"remember by doing\" with minimal theory. |\n| **Reflect** | Late Afternoon<br>(3:30-4:00) | Integration & Feedback | Daily reflection using Muayad's sticky-note method (MH-HV-13) where participants anonymously share what they learned, connecting technical skills to market realities. |\n\nThis structure repeatedly emerged from stakeholder feedback as ideal for maintaining engagement in Mosul's climate while respecting local learning preferences.\n\n### Pedagogic Pillars\n\n| Pedagogic Pillar | Concrete Classroom Practice | Local Source* |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Facilitated, not delivered | Trainer circulates, asks coaching questions; learners do 70% of the talking/doing. | BG (Bilal Ghalib) |\n| Flipped & Chunked | 10-min input → 50-min micro-sprint → 10-min peer debrief; four blocks/day. | BG |\n| Problem-First / Empathy | Every activity starts with a live customer scenario (cousin's roof, café freezer, farm pump). | H.F. & S.M. |\n| Visible Standards | Three color-coded wall checklists: Safety, Datasheet-Match, Quality-Control. | A.A. |\n| Peer Teaching | End of each block, one team \"teach-back\" on a spec, tool or checklist step. | H.F. |\n| Daily Reflection Loop | 15-min sticky-wall (names optional); trainer photos for M&E & next-day tweak. | M.H. |\n| Care & Mind-set | Open each morning with a 3-min \"customer-care story\" linking quality to reputation. | BG |\n\n*H.F. = Hussam Falih, S.M. = Saud Maan, A.A. = Ali Abkan, M.H. = Muayad Hasan, M.W. = Mustafa Waleed, D.N. = Dr. Nasih, BG = Bilal Ghalib\n\n## 7. Training Program Structure and Content Overview\n\nThe program follows a consistent daily structure based on the \"4-block methodology\" developed from local expert input:\n\n### Program Structure Overview\n\n| Day | Focus Area | Key Activities | Learning Outcomes | Expert Insight |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Day 1 | Solar Fundamentals & Hands-on Equipment | • Hands-on component examination<br>• Load calculation in amperes<br>• Financial value proposition basics<br>• Home energy audit | • Identify solar components<br>• Calculate load in amperes<br>• Assess site suitability<br>• Begin financial literacy | \"Iraqi homeowners speak in amps, not kWh.

Because in the end, the experience will teach them.\" - Mohammed |\n\n### Integrated Assessment Approach\n\nThis program uses an innovative assessment approach that integrates technical knowledge with financial literacy:\n\n**Pre-Module Scenarios**\nAt the start of each module, trainees receive a brief realistic scenario that presents both a technical challenge and a financial decision. For example:\n\n\"A homeowner in Al-Muhandiseen has purchased low-cost batteries that failed after 8 months. They now want a new system with reliable components but are concerned about the higher upfront cost. What technical specifications would you check to ensure quality, and how would you make the financial case for better components?\"\n\nTrainees record their initial answers individually, providing a baseline for their current knowledge.\n\n**Post-Module Application**\nAt the end of each module, trainees revisit the same scenario, revising their answers based on what they've learned. The trainer then facilitates a group discussion comparing the before and after responses, highlighting key learning points.\n\nThis approach:\n- Creates a \"real-world\" context for abstract concepts\n- Integrates technical knowledge with sales and financial literacy\n- Makes assessment practical rather than theoretical\n- Demonstrates visible progress to trainees\n- Identifies areas for further reinforcement\n\n### Module Integration Recommendations\n(Solar Module 1 – 6-day boot-camp mapped directly to stakeholder evidence)\n\n| Day | Learning outcomes (validated need) | Anchor activity | Stakeholder evidence driving design | Core kit & resources |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 – Fundamentals + Load Audit | • express every household load in amps and amp-hours<br>• link generator cost → solar ROI | Component \"touch-tour\" (open inverter, battery, panel) → coffee-shop amp worksheet | \"Most people think about electricity in amperes, not kilowatts.\" – Hussam Falih<br>• \"We don't have anything called theory; we're all practical work.\" – Mohammed Al-Qatan | 4 demo inverters (1 faulty), power meters, amp-worksheet pads, generator-price chart |\n| 2 – Components, DC vs AC Safety | • match inverter ↔ battery specs<br>• size DC cable & breakers<br>• recognise counterfeit parts | Inverter tear-down lab → DC burn-wire demo | \"DC is not as forgiving as AC; any wrong with polarity is a disaster.\" – Saud Maan<br>• \"The most important thing is the datasheet – read it.\" – Ali Abkan | 8 genuine & 8 fake MC4 sets, torque wrenches, SPD samples, laminated datasheets |\n| 3 – Strings & Protection | • build 120 V/360 V strings safely<br>• size surge & fuse protection | 4-panel string-builder game → breaker-board wiring | \"Sometimes they neglect connecting the SPD.\" – Saud Maan<br>• Mohammed reports frequent over-voltage faults (string-inverter mismatch) | adjustable roof-rig, DIN rails, multimeters, string-calc cards |\n| 4 – Mounting & Environment | • calculate wind load<br>• torque fasteners<br>• shade-pathfinder use | Roof-rack torque race → site visit | \"Solar panels fall because of poor mounting.\" – Mohammed Al-Qatan | two roof mock-ups, digital pathfinder, anemometer, cracked-cell demo panel |\n| 5 – Design, Finance & Sales | • complete PVsyst design<br>• compute ROI & TCO<br>• craft customer pitch | Street-survey + ROI spreadsheet → sales role-play | \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper.\" – Ali Abkan<br>• \"Generator prices have doubled this year.\" – Saud Maan | 10 laptops w/ PVsyst, ROI templates, generator-cost dataset, role-play cards |\n| 6 – Capstone Build-off & Job Bridge | • assemble 4-panel hybrid system<br>• defend design in employer interview | Employer-judged build-off + mock interviews | \"The exam is the interview.\" – Mohammed Al-Qatan<br>• Saud's idea for installation competition | 4 full 4-panel rigs, interview rubrics, internship MoU letters |\n\n### Why this 6-day arc meets every insight\n- Hands-on first – 70% practical blocks honour Mohammed's \"no paper & pen\" rule.\n- Amp language – every sizing sheet begins in amps, converting to kW only for the Bill-of-Materials, directly tackling Hussam's observation of generator billing norms.\n- Sales-engineering thread – each technical exercise ends with a cash-story (generator vs solar, cheap vs premium inverter) echoing Ali's insistence on financial literacy.\n- Failure-as-teacher – daily \"bugged rig\" or photo-failure ice-breakers respond to Muayad's view that mistakes are the fastest teacher.\n\n### Cross-module bridges (solar ↔ insulation ↔ architecture)\nOn Day 4 students calculate how a white-roof paint job cuts panel temperature by 6°C, shrinking mismatch losses by ~2%—a live example of the \"energy ecosystem\" Dr Nasih championed. Homework asks them to re-size the array if the same house were insulated to 0.4 W/m²K, reinforcing load-reduction parallels for the forthcoming insulation module.\n\n### Trainer deployment & class logistics\nOne master trainer (Mohammed or Muayad) + 2 assistants handle four parallel stations; max 20 trainees as per Muayad's structure note. Rotation every 90 min keeps all stations busy; assistants run safety checkpoints with a red-tag / green-tag QC drill recommended by Saud. Gamified recap – a 10-question Kahoot at 15:30 daily satisfies trainer Waleed's engagement tip.\n\n## 8. Consolidated Qualitative Insights\n\nFrom our interviews with trainers and stakeholders, five key thematic clusters emerged that will shape our training approach:\n\n### 8.1 Sales Engineering: A Core Competency\n\nMultiple stakeholders emphasized that technical skill alone doesn't ensure success in Mosul's solar market which requires awareness and visibility on the possibilities and benefits of green home retrofitting and design. We've developed the concept of \"Sales Engineering\" as a distinct competency that combines technical knowledge with customer empathy and financial literacy. This approach:\n\n- Reframes solar technicians as problem-solvers who align solutions with client priorities (Mustafa Waleed highlighted a client whose primary concern was \"making sure his coffee machine works\")\n- Equips graduates with tools to demonstrate ROI and lifetime value (Ali Abkan: \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper\")\n- Teaches how to use social proof and local success stories rather than technical specifications to persuade customers (Hussam Falih: \"We always tell them person X installed it... this really encourages them\")\n- Develops skills to present technical information in accessible terms using local metaphors and examples\n\nThis competency will be integrated throughout the curriculum rather than treated as a separate module, reflecting its foundational importance to success in the Mosul market.\n\n### 8.2. Module Interdependency: The Energy Ecosystem Approach\n\nOur stakeholder engagement revealed that solar, insulation, and architecture should not be be made aware of the other dimensions. There are possibilities that panels provide insulation and that insulation reduces the number of batteries you need(cost savings!) as isolated domains but as interconnected components of a unified energy ecosystem. This insight transforms our approach to all three modules:\n\n| Module | Focus Area | Interconnection Points |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Solar** | Electrical energy flows, system sizing, power generation | - Solar panels provide roof shading, reducing cooling loads<br>- System sizing requirements decrease with proper insulation<br>- Proper architectural orientation affects panel placement and efficiency |\n| **Insulation** | Thermal envelope, heat transfer, material selection | - Reduces HVAC loads, allowing smaller solar systems<br>- Extends equipment life by reducing operating hours<br>- Creates healthier indoor environments (reduced illness) |\n| **Architecture** | Traditional wisdom, passive cooling, spatial orientation | - Window placement affects natural lighting needs<br>- Courtyard designs create natural ventilation<br>- Mosul heritage designs naturally regulate temperature |\n\nWe're developing cross-module exercises that demonstrate these interconnections quantitatively (e.g., calculating how much smaller a solar system can be when paired with proper insulation).\n\n### 8.3. Dr. Nasih's Solar Water Heater 3-Day Module\n\nDr. Nasih Hma Salah, a RENAC Master Trainer since 2019 with approximately 14 years of solar experience, proposed an innovative approach to expand market entry points. His recommendation for a condensed 3-day solar water heater training (these are notes from our transcription indicating this: DN-HV-5, DN-HV-14) offers several strategic advantages:\n\n- **Lower barrier to entry**: Solar water heaters require less technical knowledge than PV systems, making them accessible to a broader range of participants including plumbers and general contractors\n- **Market gap opportunity**: Dr. Nasih identified this as an underserved market segment in Mosul with significant potential\n- **Cost efficiency**: Solar thermal systems typically cost less than PV, offering customers an affordable first step into solar energy\n- **Complementary skills**: Thermal system installation develops transferable skills in solar orientation, mounting, and customer assessment that support later PV training\n\nWe propose developing this as a standalone module that can either serve as an entry point for those without electrical backgrounds or as a specialization for PV graduates looking to expand their service offerings.\n\n### 8.4. Capstone Project: Real-World Design Challenge\n\nStakeholders consistently emphasized the importance of authentic assessment through real-world projects. The capstone project approach combines several key recommendations:\n\n- Mohammed Al-Qatan's suggestion for mock job interviews as final assessment (MQ-HV-6)\n- Saud Maan's proposal for an installation competition judged by potential employers (SM-HV-7)\n- Dr. Nasih's emphasis on solving actual client problems (DN-HV-8)\n- Several trainers' recommendation that each participant design a system for their own home\n\nThe capstone structure includes:\n\n1. Each trainee selects a real site (their home, relative's business, etc.) with ≤150m² roof area (following Dr. Nasih's recommendation to focus on small residential)\n2. They develop a complete system design including load calculation, component selection, mounting plan, and financial analysis\n3. On Day 6, they present this design to a panel of local employers in a mock job interview format scoring their efforts and developing relationships with the \n4. Top performers, groups or projects may be invited to participate in the \"Solar Festival\" showcase event (SM-HV-8)\n\nThis approach creates a direct bridge between training and employment while ensuring skills are applied to authentic local contexts.\n\n### 8.5 Consolidated Solar Training Principles\n\n(with Trainer Initials for Cited Insights — aligned to Deliverable 1 TOR)\n\n| # | Principle | What it Means in Practice | Key Evidence |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 | **Hands-on First, Theory Second** | ≥ 70% of every module is practical: trainees crimp, torque, mount, commission and troubleshoot before any slide deck. | \"We don't have anything called theory; we are all practical work.\" – MA-HV-17 |\n| 2 | **Datasheet & Spec-Sheet Literacy** | Every new component is introduced with a bilingual walk-through of its datasheet; quizzes require trainees to match specs across panels, inverters and batteries. | \"The most important thing is the datasheet.\" – AA-HV-04 |\n| 3 | **DC Safety is Non-Negotiable** | Dedicated 45-minute lab on DC vs AC wiring, breaker and fuse rating, arc-fault risks; only DC-rated parts allowed in demos. | \"DC cable & breaker spec ignored in Iraq, causing fires.\" – MA-HV-17 |\n| 4 | **Local Context Integration** | All loads expressed in amps, not kWh; price sheets, case-studies and failure photos are Mosul-specific; dust, heat and unstable grid built into loss factors. | MA-HV-18, MA-HV-20, MA-HV-21 |\n| 5 | **Measure → Design → Install → Monitor Loop** | Trainees run a full cycle: site audit → PVsyst/HOMER simulation → 4-panel roof-rig installation → live monitoring & tuning. | \"Closed feedback loop: design → install → monitor → redesign.\" – SM-HV-02 |\n| 6 | **Learning-Through-Mistakes Library** | Daily \"failure photo\" ice-breaker plus a bugged demo-rig so trainees diagnose real wiring & mounting errors. | MA-HV-05, MA-HV-27 |\n| 7 | **Financial Storytelling & ROI** | Each technical task ends with a cash-flow or TCO illustration (generator amps vs solar, cheap vs premium inverter, O&M packages). | \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper.\" – AA-HV-08 |\n| 8 | **Daily Reflection with Named Sticky Notes** | End-of-day wall where trainees post \"One thing I learnt / found interesting / still unclear\" **with their name** to support M&E photo capture. | Adapted from MM-HV-15method; partner feedback requests names on notes |\n| 9 | **4-Station Group Rotation (4–5 pax)** | Parallel stations (mounting, wiring, simulation, battery QA) keep class size 20–24 active; friends separated to avoid dependency. | MM-HV-12 |\n| 10 | **Peer Teaching & Storytelling** | Micro-presentations: each learner teaches one device or local success story on a flip-chart to reinforce terminology. | SA-HV-25, Qual-12 |\n| 11 | **Visual over Written** | Flip-charts, annotated photos, live demos and Google-Earth walk-throughs replace long text; Arabic/English glossary posters stay on the wall. | Guide pedagogy section + MA-HV-13 |\n| 12 | **Pre / Post Scenario Assessment** | Scenario cards (technical *and* financial) answered at start and end of each day/module to evidence competence gains. | Guide M&E section |\n| 13 | **Quality-vs-Counterfeit Awareness** | Tear-down of cheap vs Tier-1 inverters, battery authenticity checklist, warranty verification drill. | AA-HV-10, AA-HV-14 |\n| 14 | **Employment & Entrepreneurship Pathway** | Mock interviews with local employers, internship MOUs, \"solar festival\" showcase, and micro-finance/loan briefing embedded in Day 6. | MA-HV-22, SA-HV-30, Guide employment plan |\n| 15 | **After-Sales & O&M Mind-set** | Module on cleaning schedules, service-contract templates and battery health checks; trainees draft an O&M offer during class. | MA-HV-20, MA-HV-28 |\n| 16 | **Simulation Before Field Work** | PVsyst (or free online) session precedes roof-rig practice; 20 trial licences budgeted. | SM-HV-01 |\n| 17 | **Accredited, Co-branded Certification** | Course certificate co-signed by RENAC/GISAGE & ITC; final assessment = safe 4-panel install + design & ROI report for trainee's own home. | AA-HV-06, certificate insight |\n| 18 | **Inclusive, Mixed-Ability Intake** | Entry screening ensures basic electrical numeracy, but activities pair stronger with emerging learners; bilingual materials support non-native English speakers. | Core principle 1 + AA-HV-07 |\n\n**Legend (Initials)**\n* MA: Mohammed Al Qatan\n* AA: Ali Al-Abbasi\n* SM: Saud Maan\n* MM: Muayad Muheisen\n* SA: Saud Al-Hadithi\n\n## 9.
