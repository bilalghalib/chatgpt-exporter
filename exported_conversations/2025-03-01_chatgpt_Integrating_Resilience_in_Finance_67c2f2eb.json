      "content": "To seamlessly integrate the **Cost Model**, **Balance Sheet**, and **Financial Model Spreadsheet** using the **Integrated Business Resilience Framework**, here’s how we can approach it:\n\n### **1. Integration Strategy**\nThe **Cost Model (Session 9)** and **Balance Sheet (Session 10)** both contribute to the **Financial Model**, but currently, they exist as separate instructional materials. To align with the resilience framework, we need to:\n- Frame **efficiency** and **risk reduction** as strategic business advantages.\n- Use **customer journey mapping** and **value-aligned decision-making** to enhance financial decision-making.\n- Incorporate **long-term resilience** metrics into financial planning.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Enhancements**\n| **Module**         | **Integration with Resilience Framework** |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Cost Model** | - Introduce **resource efficiency calculations** in cost structures.  <br> - Emphasize **long-term cost savings** from investments (e.g., bulk orders, durable equipment). <br> - Include **risk assessment for price fluctuations** (e.g., energy costs, material shortages). <br> - Add a **worksheet** on **\"No-Regrets Path\"** for cost management (aligning costs with customer values). |\n| **Balance Sheet** | - Include a **Resilience Metrics Section** (tracking sustainability-driven efficiencies). <br> - Link **CAPEX vs. OPEX decisions** to long-term financial health. <br> - Demonstrate how **investment in efficiency** impacts balance sheet stability. <br> - Add case examples of businesses leveraging **sustainability as a competitive advantage**. |\n| **Financial Model** | - Add a **scenario planning section** to test resilience against resource volatility. <br> - Incorporate **business efficiency checklists** into cost and revenue projections. <br> - Connect **risk & resilience assessments** to cash flow management. <br> - Ensure financial ratios highlight **both short-term gains and long-term stability**. |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specific Action Plan**\n#### **Cost Model Adjustments**\n- **Integrate Resilience Thinking into COGS Calculation:**\n  - Introduce **bulk purchase scenarios** to compare long-term cost efficiency.\n  - Add a **sustainability cost-benefit analysis** (e.g., comparing cheap vs. durable materials).\n  - Show examples of **cost risk mitigation strategies** (e.g., supplier diversification, hedging strategies).\n\n- **Enhance Decision-Making with a Risk & Resilience Assessment Tool**\n  - A simple worksheet for startups to evaluate **operational efficiency risks**.\n  - Example: \"If energy prices rise by 10%, how does this impact production costs?\"\n  - This ties into scenario planning in the Financial Model.\n\n#### **Balance Sheet Adjustments**\n- **Incorporate Efficiency and Risk Management Metrics**\n  - Introduce **long-term investment ROI tracking** (CAPEX vs. operational costs).\n  - Highlight how **resource-efficient strategies** affect liabilities and equity.\n\n- **Connect Balance Sheet to the \"No-Regrets Path\"**\n  - Ensure customer-driven business values align with **financial decision-making**.\n  - Example: If customers value sustainability, should assets reflect eco-friendly investments?\n\n#### **Financial Model Adjustments**\n- **Introduce Scenario Planning in Cash Flow Management**\n  - Build a resilience-driven scenario modeling tool.\n  - Example: \"How does a 5% increase in energy costs affect financial health?\"\n  \n- **Align Financial Ratios with Business Resilience**\n  - Add a metric to show how **efficiency investments impact financial sustainability**.\n  - Example: \"How do upfront efficiency costs lower long-term operational expenses?\"\n\n---\n\n### **4. Implementation Framework**\nTo apply this within the training modules:\n- **Identify 3-4 High-Impact Slides for Each Module**\n  - Cost Model: Slides on **COGS, Efficiency, Bulk Purchases**.\n  - Balance Sheet: Slides on **Assets, Liabilities, CAPEX/OPEX**.\n  - Financial Model: Slides on **Cash Flow, Scenario Planning**.\n\n- **Update Facilitator Notes**\n  - Add discussion prompts like: *\"How does reducing operational waste improve financial sustainability?\"*\n\n- **Create a Business Case Example**\n  - Example: A business that **switched to energy-efficient operations** and **increased long-term profitability**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n- Do you want me to **edit the decks** directly with these integrations?\n- Or should we create **supplementary worksheets and facilitator notes** to enhance the current content?\n\nThis will ensure that the **Cost Model, Balance Sheet, and Financial Model** work **seamlessly within the Integrated Business Resilience Framework** while maintaining clarity for the entrepreneurs using them. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!",

Reframe Resource Efficiency as Strategic Business Advantage\nCurrent State: Page 6 of the Cost Model shows resource efficiency as a separate section rather than being integrated throughout.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nMove the Resource Efficiency ROI calculation earlier in the Cost Model deck (around slide 5) as a core cost consideration\nAdd concrete examples showing how efficiency investments reduce costs over time\nConnect to the Balance Sheet by showing how these investments appear in both places\nExample slide addition:\n\n\nCopy\nSTRATEGIC EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS\n                 Initial Cost    3-Year ROI    Payback Period\nSolar Panels      $3,000         60%          3.1 years\nLED Lighting      $500           85%          1.4 years\nWater Systems     $800           40%          2.5 years\n\n→ Appears on Balance Sheet as: Fixed Asset\n→ Reduces monthly operating costs by: $XXX\n→ Improves customer perception score by: XX%\n2. Incorporate Risk Assessment into Cost Sections\nCurrent State: The decks discuss costs but not how they relate to business risks and resilience.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nAdd a \"Risk & Resilience\" column to the cost planning sections\nShow how certain costs (like diversifying suppliers) reduce vulnerability\nCreate visuals showing the relationship between financial decisions and business continuity\nExample modification for slide 15 in Cost Model:\n\n\nCopy\nSG&A EXPENSES\nItem               Monthly Cost    Risk Reduction Value\nLocal Suppliers    $XXX            Reduces supply chain disruption by XX%\nRenewable Energy   $XXX            Eliminates price volatility risk worth $XXX/year\n3. Connect Financial Planning to the Business Efficiency Workbook\nCurrent State: The financial model and Business Efficiency Workbook operate independently.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nCreate direct links between the Business Efficiency Workbook and the financial model\nAdd a slide showing how efficiency priorities from the workbook translate to financial inputs\nDevelop a unified view of how improvements affect all financial statements\nExample integration slide:\n\n\nCopy\nEFFICIENCY WORKBOOK → FINANCIAL MODEL INTEGRATION\n\nPriority Action          Efficiency Score    Financial Impact\nProcess Optimization    5.0                 -$100/month operational costs\nSolar Panel Investment  4.8                 -$22/month energy costs\n                                           +$3,000 fixed asset\nLocal Sourcing          2.2                 Supplier risk ↓ 30%\n4. Align Balance Sheet with Resilience Framework\nCurrent State: The Balance Sheet presentation focuses on mechanics without emphasizing resilience.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nAdd resilience metrics to the Balance Sheet section\nShow how a strong balance sheet relates to business adaptability\nIncorporate environmental asset valuation alongside traditional assets\nExample addition to Balance Sheet slide 18:\n\n\nCopy\nRESILIENCE INDICATORS FROM YOUR BALANCE SHEET\n\nCash Ratio: XX% (Target: >30% for crisis resilience)\nResource Efficiency Assets: $XXX (XX% of total assets)\nDiversification Score: XX/100\n5. Develop \"No-Regrets Path\" Framework for Financial Decision Making\nCurrent State: Financial decisions are presented as purely economic choices.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nCreate a decision framework highlighting investments that make sense in multiple scenarios\nEmphasize choices that have financial benefits regardless of environmental considerations\nShow how efficiency investments pay off even in worst-case scenarios\nExample framework slide:\n\n\nCopy\nNO-REGRETS FINANCIAL DECISIONS\n\n                    Positive ROI    Customer Value    Risk Reduction\nSolar Panels        ✓               ✓                 ✓\nLED Lighting        ✓               -                 ✓\nLocal Suppliers     ✓               ✓                 ✓\nImplementation Guidance\nFor Cost Model:\nUpdate slide 5 to show how costs reflect values and risk management\nModify slide 6 to connect COGS with resource efficiency\nEnhance slide 15 to incorporate risk metrics alongside financial ones\nAdd a slide showing how the Business Efficiency Workbook priorities translate to actual line items\nFor Balance Sheet:\nAdd resilience metrics to slide 17\nModify slide 18 to show how environmental investments appear on the balance sheet\nCreate a visual connection between assets, liabilities, and business continuity\nIncorporate resource efficiency accounting into the fixed assets section\nFor Financial Model Integration:\nCreate a dedicated tab for Resource Efficiency Analysis in the model\nAdd comparative projections showing efficiency vs. traditional approaches\nImplement risk scoring for different financial strategies\nSpecific Slide Modifications\nCost Model Deck:\nSlide 5: Add a \"Strategic Layer\" showing how costs reflect values and risk management\nSlide 6: Add efficiency comparison to standard COGS calculation\nSlide 12-13: Add risk reduction value alongside cost metrics\nSlide 15: Incorporate the Resource Efficiency ROI calculation as a standard part of SG&A planning\nBalance Sheet Deck:\nSlide 17: Add resilience indicators derived from balance sheet metrics\nSlide 18: Highlight how resource efficiency investments appear as assets\nSlide 20: Add a \"Resilience Effect\" column to show how balance sheet changes impact business stability\nBy implementing these changes, you'll create a more integrated approach that positions sustainability and efficiency as core business strategies rather than add-ons. This aligns perfectly with the Integrated Business Resilience Framework's business-first approach while ensuring practical tools are available for decision-making.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these recommendations?\n\n\n\n]]]",

Reframe Resource Efficiency as a Core Cost Factor**\n**Before**: Resource efficiency is treated as a separate topic in the Cost Model (appears late, not deeply connected to financial decisions).\n- **Issue**: It feels like an \"extra\" rather than a strategic cost-reduction and resilience-building tool.\n\n**After**: Move **resource efficiency** considerations **earlier** in the Cost Model deck (around Slide 5).  \n- Introduce a **Resource Efficiency ROI Table** showing **payback periods** and **long-term cost savings**.\n- Explicitly **link efficiency investments** to **financial statements** (showing their impact on the Balance Sheet).\n\n🔹 **Example Change for Cost Model Slide 5**:\n---\n**Strategic Efficiency Investments – Impact on Business Costs**\n| **Investment** | **Initial Cost** | **Annual Savings** | **Payback Period** | **Balance Sheet Impact** |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| Solar Panels | $3,000 | $1,200 | 2.5 years | Fixed Asset – Reduces Monthly OpEx |\n| LED Lighting | $500 | $250 | 2 years | Fixed Asset – Energy Cost Savings |\n| Local Sourcing | $800 | $300 | 2.7 years | COGS Reduction – Supply Chain Stability |\n---\n- This connects **cost reduction** to **financial resilience** (appearing in **cost structure, efficiency, and balance sheet entries**).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Incorporate Risk Assessment in Cost Planning**\n**Before**: The Cost Model deck doesn’t highlight how **different costs impact business resilience**.\n- No discussion of **supply chain risks, operational disruptions, or financial risks** in cost structure.\n\n**After**: Add a **Risk & Resilience Column** in cost breakdowns.\n- Show **how supplier diversification, energy independence, and efficiency choices reduce business risk**.\n\n🔹 **Example Change for Cost Model Slide 15**\n---\n**SG&A EXPENSES – Risk & Resilience Considerations**\n| **Expense Item** | **Monthly Cost** | **Risk Reduction Value** |\n|----------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Local Suppliers | $XXX | Reduces supply chain disruption risk by XX% |\n| Renewable Energy | $XXX | Eliminates price volatility risk of $XXX/year |\n| Process Automation | $XXX | Reduces operational downtime by XX% |\n---\n- This **connects efficiency decisions to financial stability** and ensures entrepreneurs **think beyond costs to resilience**.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Align Business Efficiency Workbook with Financial Model**\n**Before**: The **Business Efficiency Workbook** operates separately from the financial model.\n- The **prioritization of efficiency actions** does not directly influence financial forecasts.\n\n**After**: **Create a direct mapping** between efficiency improvements in the workbook and **financial projections**.\n- Add **a slide to show how workbook priorities feed into the financial model**.\n\n🔹 **Example New Slide for Cost Model (Efficiency Workbook Integration)**\n---\n**Business Efficiency Workbook → Financial Model Integration**\n| **Priority Action** | **Efficiency Score** | **Financial Impact** |\n|------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Process Optimization | 5.0 | -$100/month in operating costs |\n| Solar Panel Investment | 4.8 | -$22/month energy costs, +$3,000 fixed asset |\n| Local Sourcing | 2.2 | Supplier risk ↓ 30% |\n---\n- **This ensures decisions made in the efficiency workbook directly impact financial modeling**.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Strengthen Balance Sheet’s Role in Resilience**\n**Before**: The **Balance Sheet deck** teaches financial structure but **doesn’t connect assets and liabilities to business resilience**.\n\n**After**: Add a **Resilience Indicators Section** to track **how financial health supports business sustainability**.\n- Introduce **new resilience-focused financial ratios**.\n\n🔹 **Example Addition to Balance Sheet Slide 17**\n---\n**Resilience Indicators from Your Balance Sheet**\n| **Metric** | **Current** | **Target** | **Why It Matters** |\n|-------------|----------|---------|-----------------|\n| Cash Ratio | XX% | >30% | Ensures liquidity in crisis |\n| Resource Efficiency Assets | $XXX | XX% of total assets | Long-term cost reduction |\n| Diversification Score | XX/100 | >80 | Lowers risk exposure |\n---\n- This **helps entrepreneurs see financial planning as a tool for long-term business stability**.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Introduce \"No-Regrets Path\" for Financial Decision-Making**\n**Before**: Financial decisions in the decks focus on **profitability but not resilience**.\n- No framework to show **how certain investments provide benefits across multiple business scenarios**.\n\n**After**: **Create a \"No-Regrets\" Decision Framework**.\n- Highlight **decisions that are beneficial regardless of market conditions**.\n\n🔹 **Example New Slide for Financial Decision-Making**\n---\n**No-Regrets Financial Decisions**\n| **Investment** | **Positive ROI** | **Customer Value** | **Risk Reduction** |\n|----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Solar Panels | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| LED Lighting | ✓ | - | ✓ |\n| Local Suppliers | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n---\n- This **helps entrepreneurs make strategic choices that align with financial stability, customer trust, and operational resilience**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Key Changes**\n| **Before** | **After** |\n|----------|---------|\n| Sustainability appears as a separate section | Integrated into cost planning, balance sheet, and financial model |\n| No risk assessment in cost model | Risk assessment added to SG&A and cost planning |\n| Business Efficiency Workbook disconnected from financials | Direct link between efficiency workbook and financial model |\n| Balance sheet teaches mechanics but lacks resilience focus | New **Resilience Indicators** added |\n| Financial decisions focused only on profitability | New **No-Regrets Decision Framework** added |\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Implementation for Deck Updates**\n✅ **For Cost Model Deck**:\n1. **Slide 5**: Add **Resource Efficiency ROI** Table.\n2. **Slide 6**: Connect **COGS with Efficiency Choices**.\n3. **Slide 15**: **Risk & Resilience** column in cost planning.\n4. **New Slide**: Business Efficiency Workbook Integration.\n\n✅ **For Balance Sheet Deck**:\n1. **Slide 17**: Add **Resilience Metrics**.\n2. **Slide 18**: Show how **resource efficiency investments** appear as assets.\n3. **New Slide**: **Resilience Effect** of financial decisions.\n\n✅ **For Financial Model**:\n1. **Create a new tab** for **Resource Efficiency Analysis**.\n2. **Add comparative projections**: Efficiency vs. Traditional approach.\n3. **Risk scoring** for different financial strategies.\n\n---\n### **Final Thoughts**\nBy implementing these changes:\n- Entrepreneurs **see sustainability as a business advantage**, not an extra cost.\n- The **Balance Sheet becomes a tool for long-term resilience**, not just a financial snapshot.\n- **Financial decisions align with business efficiency and risk reduction**.\n\nWould you like me to **edit the decks** directly with these changes? Or should we **draft facilitator notes and worksheets** to guide implementation?",

Reframe Resource Efficiency as Strategic Business Advantage\nCurrent State: Page 6 of the Cost Model shows resource efficiency as a separate section rather than being integrated throughout.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nMove the Resource Efficiency ROI calculation earlier in the Cost Model deck (around slide 5) as a core cost consideration\nAdd concrete examples showing how efficiency investments reduce costs over time\nConnect to the Balance Sheet by showing how these investments appear in both places\nExample slide addition:\n\n\nCopy\nSTRATEGIC EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS\n                 Initial Cost    3-Year ROI    Payback Period\nSolar Panels      $3,000         60%          3.1 years\nLED Lighting      $500           85%          1.4 years\nWater Systems     $800           40%          2.5 years\n\n→ Appears on Balance Sheet as: Fixed Asset\n→ Reduces monthly operating costs by: $XXX\n→ Improves customer perception score by: XX%\n2. Incorporate Risk Assessment into Cost Sections\nCurrent State: The decks discuss costs but not how they relate to business risks and resilience.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nAdd a \"Risk & Resilience\" column to the cost planning sections\nShow how certain costs (like diversifying suppliers) reduce vulnerability\nCreate visuals showing the relationship between financial decisions and business continuity\nExample modification for slide 15 in Cost Model:\n\n\nCopy\nSG&A EXPENSES\nItem               Monthly Cost    Risk Reduction Value\nLocal Suppliers    $XXX            Reduces supply chain disruption by XX%\nRenewable Energy   $XXX            Eliminates price volatility risk worth $XXX/year\n3. Connect Financial Planning to the Business Efficiency Workbook\nCurrent State: The financial model and Business Efficiency Workbook operate independently.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nCreate direct links between the Business Efficiency Workbook and the financial model\nAdd a slide showing how efficiency priorities from the workbook translate to financial inputs\nDevelop a unified view of how improvements affect all financial statements\nExample integration slide:\n\n\nCopy\nEFFICIENCY WORKBOOK → FINANCIAL MODEL INTEGRATION\n\nPriority Action          Efficiency Score    Financial Impact\nProcess Optimization    5.0                 -$100/month operational costs\nSolar Panel Investment  4.8                 -$22/month energy costs\n                                           +$3,000 fixed asset\nLocal Sourcing          2.2                 Supplier risk ↓ 30%\n4. Align Balance Sheet with Resilience Framework\nCurrent State: The Balance Sheet presentation focuses on mechanics without emphasizing resilience.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nAdd resilience metrics to the Balance Sheet section\nShow how a strong balance sheet relates to business adaptability\nIncorporate environmental asset valuation alongside traditional assets\nExample addition to Balance Sheet slide 18:\n\n\nCopy\nRESILIENCE INDICATORS FROM YOUR BALANCE SHEET\n\nCash Ratio: XX% (Target: >30% for crisis resilience)\nResource Efficiency Assets: $XXX (XX% of total assets)\nDiversification Score: XX/100\n5. Develop \"No-Regrets Path\" Framework for Financial Decision Making\nCurrent State: Financial decisions are presented as purely economic choices.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nCreate a decision framework highlighting investments that make sense in multiple scenarios\nEmphasize choices that have financial benefits regardless of environmental considerations\nShow how efficiency investments pay off even in worst-case scenarios\nExample framework slide:\n\n\nCopy\nNO-REGRETS FINANCIAL DECISIONS\n\n                    Positive ROI    Customer Value    Risk Reduction\nSolar Panels        ✓               ✓                 ✓\nLED Lighting        ✓               -                 ✓\nLocal Suppliers     ✓               ✓                 ✓\nImplementation Guidance\nFor Cost Model:\nUpdate slide 5 to show how costs reflect values and risk management\nModify slide 6 to connect COGS with resource efficiency\nEnhance slide 15 to incorporate risk metrics alongside financial ones\nAdd a slide showing how the Business Efficiency Workbook priorities translate to actual line items\nFor Balance Sheet:\nAdd resilience metrics to slide 17\nModify slide 18 to show how environmental investments appear on the balance sheet\nCreate a visual connection between assets, liabilities, and business continuity\nIncorporate resource efficiency accounting into the fixed assets section\nFor Financial Model Integration:\nCreate a dedicated tab for Resource Efficiency Analysis in the model\nAdd comparative projections showing efficiency vs. traditional approaches\nImplement risk scoring for different financial strategies\nSpecific Slide Modifications\nCost Model Deck:\nSlide 5: Add a \"Strategic Layer\" showing how costs reflect values and risk management\nSlide 6: Add efficiency comparison to standard COGS calculation\nSlide 12-13: Add risk reduction value alongside cost metrics\nSlide 15: Incorporate the Resource Efficiency ROI calculation as a standard part of SG&A planning\nBalance Sheet Deck:\nSlide 17: Add resilience indicators derived from balance sheet metrics\nSlide 18: Highlight how resource efficiency investments appear as assets\nSlide 20: Add a \"Resilience Effect\" column to show how balance sheet changes impact business stability\nBy implementing these changes, you'll create a more integrated approach that positions sustainability and efficiency as core business strategies rather than add-ons. This aligns perfectly with the Integrated Business Resilience Framework's business-first approach while ensuring practical tools are available for decision-making.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these recommendations?\n\n\n\n]]]",

      "content": "Below is a **fresh, step-by-step analysis** that compares the original Cost Model and Balance Sheet decks with the updated recommendations. I've highlighted **“Before”** (the current state) vs. **“After”** (the improved version), followed by **how** to implement each change and **why** it matters. This gives you a clear roadmap to integrate these decks more seamlessly with the Financial Model spreadsheet, all while aligning with the **Integrated Business Resilience Framework**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Reframe Resource Efficiency as a Strategic Business Advantage\n\n### **BEFORE**\n- **Cost Model Deck**: Resource efficiency might appear as a separate bullet or slide (e.g., “optional sustainability considerations”), without clear ROI examples.\n- **Balance Sheet Deck**: Investments in efficiency (like solar panels, better insulation, etc.) are not explicitly shown under assets or future cost savings.\n- **Financial Model**: No direct linkage (e.g., a user can’t easily see how an efficiency measure impacts monthly costs or overall ROI).\n\n### **AFTER**\n1. **Cost Model Deck**  \n   - Move **resource efficiency** content into the **core** COGS/SG&A slides.  \n   - Include **concrete ROI** calculations for efficiency measures (e.g., LED lighting, water-saving devices).  \n   - Show **payback period** and **long-term cost savings** in the same slide where you list normal expenses.\n\n2. **Balance Sheet Deck**  \n   - Add a line item under **“Fixed Assets”** or **“Property, Plant & Equipment”** for resource-efficiency investments (e.g., “Solar Panels - $3,000”).  \n   - Use **notes** or a small table to highlight the **expected 3-year ROI** or depreciation schedule.\n\n3. **Financial Model**  \n   - Create a simple **toggle or line item** (e.g., “Energy-Saving Equipment” cost) under CAPEX.  \n   - Show the resulting **monthly cost reduction** in Operating Expenses (e.g., a formula that subtracts $X from the monthly electricity expense once the asset is added).\n\n### **HOW to implement & WHY**  \n- **How**: \n  1. In the **Cost Model slide** where you summarize costs, add a **column** for “Efficiency Investment” with sub-columns for “Initial Cost,” “Ongoing Savings,” and “Payback Period.”  \n  2. In the **Balance Sheet slides**, add an **example line** under assets: “Energy-Efficient Equipment.” Link that to the depreciation/amortization schedule in your **Financial Model**.  \n  3. In your **Financial Model spreadsheet**, add a tab or section labeled “Efficiency ROI.” Connect it to your monthly cost calculations (e.g., electricity, water bills).\n\n- **Why**:  \n  - This reframing shows participants **how sustainability can be profitable**, lowers operational risk from volatile energy prices, and appeals to eco-conscious customers (market differentiation).  \n  - It aligns directly with the “**Business-First Approach**” (from the Integrated Business Resilience Framework) by showing concrete financial benefits.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Incorporate Risk Assessment into Cost Sections\n\n### **BEFORE**\n- **Cost Model Deck**: Lists typical SG&A or COGS but doesn’t show **how** certain expenditures (like diversifying suppliers) mitigate risk.\n- **Balance Sheet Deck**: Does not explicitly address **risk reduction** in asset/liability structure.\n- **Financial Model**: Lacks a scenario approach or sensitivity analysis for cost volatility (e.g., material costs rising 10%).\n\n### **AFTER**\n1. **Cost Model Deck**  \n   - Add a **Risk & Resilience** column to the SG&A or “Other Costs” slides.  \n   - Example: If you choose local suppliers, highlight **“Reduces supply chain disruption risk”** in that column, along with a possible cost premium or cost savings.\n\n2. **Balance Sheet Deck**  \n   - Introduce a slide or note referencing **“Risk-Reducing Assets”** (e.g., holding extra inventory or investing in onsite energy generation).  \n   - Show how these appear in **Assets** (inventory, backup equipment) vs. potential liabilities if underfinanced.\n\n3. **Financial Model**  \n   - Add a **scenario analysis** feature: “If raw material costs rise by 10%,” how does that change your monthly outflow?  \n   - Incorporate a simple **risk scoring** for major cost categories (e.g., “High risk for price volatility: electricity; Medium risk: packaging supplies”).\n\n### **HOW to implement & WHY**  \n- **How**:\n  1. On the **Cost Model slides**, create a small table that includes “Item,” “Monthly Cost,” and a new column “Risk Reduction Impact.”  \n  2. On the **Balance Sheet** summary slide, add bullet points explaining how certain assets reduce business risks (like “buffer inventory,” “energy independence”).  \n  3. In the **Financial Model**, add a “Scenario Planning” tab or a “What If” column to quickly see the impact of changes in cost.\n\n- **Why**:  \n  - Risk management is a **core principle** of resilience. By explicitly tagging each cost line item with its risk reduction component, entrepreneurs learn **why** they might pay more for a local supplier or more durable materials (fewer disruptions, better stability).  \n  - This fosters **long-term viability** and aligns with the framework’s call to incorporate **risk assessment** into business planning.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Connect Financial Planning to an Efficiency/“No-Regrets Path” Workbook\n\n### **BEFORE**\n- The **Cost Model** and **Balance Sheet** are taught as stand-alone. The “no-regrets path” concept (customer alignment, values-based decisions) may only be discussed in theory.\n- The **Financial Model** has no direct references to a “Business Efficiency Workbook” or any separate tool to track these strategic decisions.\n\n### **AFTER**\n1. **Cost Model Deck**  \n   - Insert a slide showing **“No-Regrets Path”** examples: items that **always** save money and improve brand image. E.g., “Switching to minimal packaging saves $XX monthly, aligns with eco-conscious consumers, and reduces waste.”\n\n2. **Balance Sheet Deck**  \n   - Introduce a small table connecting **Value-Aligned Investments** (like reusable packaging systems) to **long-term asset value** or intangible brand equity.\n\n3. **Financial Model**  \n   - Provide a **linked worksheet** for “Business Efficiency & Values” (or “No-Regrets Path”)—where each recommended action auto-populates to the main model.  \n   - Show how these actions incrementally decrease monthly operating expenses or increase intangible brand value.\n\n### **HOW to implement & WHY**\n- **How**:\n  1. In the **Cost Model** slides, for each item you add (COGS, SG&A), include an example of a “no-regrets” upgrade or shift—like compostable packaging or LED lighting.  \n  2. In the **Balance Sheet** slides, highlight the intangible or brand-equity boost from these “values-driven” assets (like a relevant intangible asset row or footnote).  \n  3. In the **Financial Model**, create a tab “No-Regrets Path.” Each recommended action has a cost line item (CAPEX or OPEX) and a linked formula that modifies the main statements (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow).\n\n- **Why**:  \n  - This removes the **guesswork**: entrepreneurs see that a “no-regrets” decision is actually profitable in multiple scenarios (market growth or slowdown).  \n  - It **reinforces** the framework’s principle that “values” and “efficiency” can go together, delivering both **cost savings** and **brand differentiation**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Align the Balance Sheet with Resilience Metrics\n\n### **BEFORE**\n- The **Balance Sheet deck** focuses on standard categories (assets, liabilities, equity) without referencing **resilience indicators** or how specific assets reduce risk/improve sustainability.\n- The **Financial Model** likely just has a standard Balance Sheet tab (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) without resilience commentary.\n\n### **AFTER**\n1. **Balance Sheet Deck**  \n   - Add a slide on **“Resilience Indicators”** derived from the balance sheet. For instance:\n     - **Cash Ratio** (indicating crisis resilience),\n     - **Efficiency Assets** (% of total assets invested in eco-efficiency),\n     - **Diversification Score** (how broad your asset base or supply chain is).\n   - Show how intangible assets or brand value from eco-investments factor into “Goodwill” or “Other Assets.”\n\n2. **Financial Model**  \n   - Create a small formula or table that calculates these **resilience metrics** automatically:\n     - E.g., `(Cash / Total Assets) * 100 = Cash Ratio %`\n     - `(Eco-Efficient Assets / Total Fixed Assets) * 100 = Efficiency Ratio %`\n\n### **HOW to implement & WHY**\n- **How**:\n  1. Add a new **“Resilience Metrics”** slide in the **Balance Sheet** deck that calculates, for example, the **Cash Ratio, Eco-Asset Percentage,** and shows the “target range.”  \n  2. In your **Financial Model**’s “Balance Sheet” tab, add columns to track “Eco-Asset Value” or “Sustainability-Linked Investments” so the ratio can be automatically calculated.\n\n- **Why**:\n  - This answers the question: “**How robust is my business if something goes wrong?**” by letting entrepreneurs see at a glance if they have enough cash, how much of their business capital is in risk-reducing or efficiency-boosting assets, etc.  \n  - The framework emphasizes linking **environmental improvements** to **financial performance**—these metrics do it directly.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Develop a “No-Regrets Path” Framework for Financial Decision-Making\n\n### **BEFORE**\n- **Financial decisions** appear purely economic (cost vs. revenue).  \n- “No-Regrets Path” might be briefly mentioned in training but not systematically used.\n\n### **AFTER**\n1. **Cost Model Deck**  \n   - Dedicate a **slide or sub-section** explicitly to the “No-Regrets Decision Framework”: \n     - (1) Does it improve operational efficiency?  \n     - (2) Does it reduce risk?  \n     - (3) Does it resonate with customer values?\n\n2. **Balance Sheet Deck**  \n   - Showcase how “No-Regrets” choices become either intangible brand equity or capitalized assets that **boost** your company’s net worth.\n\n3. **Financial Model**  \n   - Add a **small decision matrix** or a column in your CAPEX tab labeled “No-Regrets?” with criteria and a simple “Yes/No” or scoring system.  \n   - Summarize the impact on the bottom line: “This LED upgrade = 2-month payback, improves brand image, minimal risk.”\n\n### **HOW to implement & WHY**\n- **How**:\n  1. In the **Cost Model** slides, literally place a “No-Regrets Framework” box and walk through an example (like “Should we invest in a packaging redesign?”).  \n  2. In the **Balance Sheet** slides, point out how intangible brand value can show up in “goodwill” or “other intangible assets” if it significantly differentiates your brand.  \n  3. In your **Financial Model**, add a short list of 3–5 typical “No-Regrets” items, each with cost, payback, and intangible value references.\n\n- **Why**:\n  - Embedding a **decision framework** helps entrepreneurs quickly see that **some investments** “always” pay off. This is a practical approach to linking **values** (like sustainability) with **profitability**.  \n  - It underscores the framework’s principle that businesses can **avoid regret** by aligning investments with both financial gain and customer/market values.\n\n---\n\n# Summary of “Before” vs. “After” Upgrades\n\nBelow is a **condensed table** to visualize the main improvements:\n\n| **Area**                  | **Before**                                                                           | **After**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **1.

Efficiency Workbook** | - No official workbook or “no-regrets path” linking costs to strategic decisions    | - A new “Efficiency/No-Regrets” slide in Cost Model <br> - Values-based items that reduce costs or improve brand <br> - Single place to track all actions linking to the financial model                                                                                                           |\n| **4. Resilience Metrics**  | - Balance sheet only covers standard items <br> - No mention of sustainability ROI | - Additional lines: “Eco-Assets” or “Resource-Efficient Assets” <br> - Resilience ratio calculations (e.g., cash ratio, diversification index) <br> - Quick snapshot on how stable the business is if external shocks occur                                                                        |\n| **5. No-Regrets Path**     | - Mentioned in theory only <br> - No structured usage in financial planning        | - Dedicated framework slide in Cost Model <br> - Ties intangible brand equity (customer values) to CAPEX decisions <br> - Mark “No-Regrets” items in the financial model, showing guaranteed ROI or brand boost                                                                                   |\n\n---\n\n# How to Execute These Changes Step by Step\n\n1. **Revise Slide Sequences**  \n   - **Cost Model**: Move sustainability/efficiency slides right after you introduce the concept of COGS and SG&A.  \n   - **Balance Sheet**: Insert a new slide just after explaining “What is a Balance Sheet?” titled “**Resilience & Balance Sheet**.”  \n\n2. **Add New Columns and Rows**  \n   - In your **Cost Model** slides (COGS, SG&A), add a column titled “Risk/Resilience” or “Efficiency Gains.”  \n   - In your **Balance Sheet** slides, show new asset rows for efficiency investments or intangible assets.  \n\n3. **Link to the Financial Model**  \n   - In the **Financial Model spreadsheet**, add:  \n     - A “Scenario Planning” tab for risk changes (e.g., 10% material cost increase).  \n     - A “No-Regrets Path” or “Efficiency ROI” tab that includes the action, the cost, and the monthly savings.  \n\n4. **Include Resilience Metrics**  \n   - On the Balance Sheet tab of the spreadsheet, add a line or column for “Eco-Asset Value,” “Diversification Score,” or “Cash Ratio.”  \n   - On a separate “Metrics” or “Dashboard” tab, automatically calculate and display these resilience indicators.  \n\n5. **Embed Examples**  \n   - For each new slide or column, offer a **worked example** (like LED lighting, local supplier costs, or solar panels). Show the cost, ROI, risk reduction, and intangible brand benefits.  \n\n6. **Facilitator Notes**  \n   - In your slides’ speaker notes, prompt the audience to **think about risk**: “How might a spike in fuel prices hurt your margins? Could investing in e-vehicles or local suppliers reduce that vulnerability?”  \n   - Encourage them to **use the “No-Regrets Path”** with a mini-checklist: “(1) Does it lower cost? (2) Does it reduce risk? (3) Does it align with customer values?”  \n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nBy weaving these **“Before” vs. “After”** changes throughout your Cost Model, Balance Sheet, and Financial Model:\n\n1. You **integrate** sustainability and risk management as **core strategic advantages**, not an afterthought.  \n2. You create a **cohesive storyline**: from cost calculations (COGS, SG&A) → to asset investments on the balance sheet → to scenario-based financial modeling.  \n3. Participants see **direct financial benefits** (ROI, payback periods) while also **building resilience** (risk reduction, stable supply chains, strong brand).  \n\nThis **step-by-step approach** ensures clarity for trainers and entrepreneurs alike. Each module flows logically into the next, with consistent references to **efficiency, resilience, and customer values**—the core of the **Integrated Business Resilience Framework**.",

      "content": "thoughts about these new slides, where should I put them and how should i order the slides:[[[I've reviewed the additional document, which provides a comprehensive framework for integrating sustainability and resilience into the Cost Model and Balance Sheet decks. It's a strong foundation, but we can streamline it for higher impact with less implementation effort.\n\nHere's my assessment of the highest-impact changes along with the specific slide content you can implement:\n\n# Streamlined High-Impact Changes\n\n## 1. Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator (Cost Model - New Slide)\n\nThis addition will have the most immediate impact by directly showing how sustainability investments translate to financial returns.\n\n```markdown\n# Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator\n\n| Investment | Initial Cost | Annual Savings | Payback (months) | 3-Year ROI | Risk Reduction |\n|------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|\n| Solar Panels | $3,000 | $960 | 38 | 60% | Energy price stability |\n| LED Lighting | $500 | $240 | 25 | 144% | Lower maintenance |\n| Water Systems | $800 | $300 | 32 | 113% | Resource security |\n\n**Appears on Balance Sheet as:** Fixed Assets\n**Reduces Monthly Expenses by:** $125\n**Customer Value:** Brand differentiation, price stability\n\n*Insert this slide immediately after introducing COGS and SG&A*\n```\n\n## 2. No-Regrets Decision Framework (Cost Model - New Slide)\n\nThis provides a practical decision-making tool that entrepreneurs can immediately apply.\n\n```markdown\n# No-Regrets Decision Framework\n\n## When making cost decisions, ask:\n\n1. **Does it improve efficiency?** \n   → Lower operating costs regardless of business conditions\n\n2. **Does it reduce risk?**\n   → Protection against supply chain, price, or climate disruptions\n\n3. **Does it align with customer values?**\n   → Potential for premium pricing or increased loyalty\n\n### Example: Packaging Redesign\n- **Efficiency:** Reduces material by 20%, saves $0.15/unit\n- **Risk:** Less dependent on plastic supply chain\n- **Values:** Meets growing customer demand for sustainable packaging\n- **Decision:** ✓ Proceed (payback: 3 months)\n\n*Insert this slide after discussing cost planning*\n```\n\n## 3. Resilience Metrics Dashboard (Balance Sheet - New Slide)\n\nThis shows how traditional balance sheet items connect to business resilience.\n\n```markdown\n# Resilience Metrics from Your Balance Sheet\n\n| Metric | Formula | Target | Your Score |\n|--------|---------|--------|------------|\n| **Cash Ratio** | Cash ÷ Current Liabilities | >30% | ___ |\n| **Resource Efficiency** | Eco-Assets ÷ Total Fixed Assets | >15% | ___ |\n| **Supply Diversity** | % of supplies with backup sources | >75% | ___ |\n\n## Impact on Financial Health:\n- **1% improvement in efficiency** = $__/month in reduced costs\n- **15% increase in cash ratio** = __ additional months of business continuity\n- **Each backup supplier** = __% reduction in supply chain disruption risk\n\n*Insert this slide after explaining the basic balance sheet structure*\n```\n\n## 4. Integrated COGS Calculator (Cost Model - Enhanced Slide)\n\nThis updates your existing COGS slide to include efficiency options.\n\n```markdown\n# Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n\n| Item | Standard Cost | Efficient Alternative | Savings/Unit | Annual Savings |\n|------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| T-Shirt | $10.00 | $8.50 (recycled fabric) | $1.50 | $1,800 |\n| Packaging | $0.75 | $0.60 (minimal design) | $0.15 | $180 |\n| Shipping | $3.50 | $2.75 (optimized routes) | $0.75 | $900 |\n\n## Risk Reduction Benefits:\n- **Recycled fabric:** Less vulnerable to cotton price volatility\n- **Minimal packaging:** Reduces plastic supply chain dependency \n- **Optimized shipping:** Lower exposure to fuel price fluctuations\n\n*Replace or enhance your existing COGS slide*\n```\n\n## 5. Balance Sheet with Efficiency Assets (Balance Sheet - Enhanced Slide)\n\nThis enhances your existing balance sheet slide to highlight efficiency investments.\n\n```markdown\n# Balance Sheet: Strategic Assets\n\n## ASSETS\n- **Cash:** $3,000\n- **Inventory:** $5,000\n- **Fixed Assets:**\n  - Standard Equipment: $12,000\n  - **Efficiency Assets:** $4,500\n    - *Solar Installation: $3,000*\n    - *Water-Saving Systems: $800*\n    - *LED Lighting: $700*\n\n## LIABILITIES AND EQUITY\n- **Current Liabilities:** $2,500\n- **Long-term Debt:** $7,000\n- **Owner's Equity:** $15,000\n\n**Note:** Efficiency assets reduce monthly expenses by $125 and enhance brand value by an estimated 5-10%\n\n*Replace or enhance your existing balance sheet slide*\n```\n\n## Implementation for Financial Model\n\nTo integrate these concepts into the financial model spreadsheet, add these specific elements:\n\n1. **Resource Efficiency Analysis Tab**:\n   - Copy the Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator table\n   - Add formulas that:\n     - Calculate monthly savings (Annual ÷ 12)\n     - Automatically reduce relevant expense lines\n     - Show cumulative savings over the 3-year period\n\n2. **Enhanced Balance Sheet Tab**:\n   - Add a line item under Fixed Assets called \"Resource Efficiency Assets\"\n   - Include a small table showing depreciation schedule for these assets\n   - Calculate resilience metrics (Cash Ratio, etc.) in a separate section\n\n3. **No-Regrets Decision Section**:\n   - Create a simple decision matrix for common business purchases\n   - Include columns for Efficiency Impact, Risk Reduction, and Customer Value\n   - Provide a \"Recommendation\" column that automatically calculates based on inputs\n\n## Roll-Out Strategy\n\nFor maximum impact with minimum changes:\n\n1. **Start with the ROI Calculator** - This creates the biggest mindset shift\n2. **Add the No-Regrets Framework** - Provides a practical decision tool\n3. **Enhance existing COGS slide** - Shows alternatives immediately\n4. **Add Resilience Metrics** - Connects to long-term business health\n5. **Update Balance Sheet** - Shows how these investments are tracked\n\nThese five focused changes will create a cohesive story while requiring minimal rework of your existing materials. They directly address the Integrated Business Resilience Framework recommendations while providing tangible, practical tools entrepreneurs can use immediately.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any specific element or provide additional slide content?]]",

      "content": "Below is a **recommended flow** for inserting the **five new or enhanced slides** into your existing **Cost Model** and **Balance Sheet** decks. The aim is to keep your current structure largely intact while weaving in these new elements so they make logical sense—and require minimal rework.\n\n---\n\n## **Cost Model Deck: Proposed Slide Order**\n\n1. **Title / Introduction**  \n   - Keep your existing opening slide(s) that introduce cost modeling, objectives, or agenda.\n\n2. **Types of Costs** (Existing)  \n   - Where you discuss COGS vs. SG&A, fixed vs. variable, etc.\n\n3. **COGS Explanation / Examples** (Existing)  \n   - If you have slides demonstrating how to calculate COGS, keep those first.  \n   - This is where learners grasp the fundamentals of production costs.\n\n4. **NEW: Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator**  \n   - Insert this immediately after basic COGS/SG&A so participants see **how efficiency investments** can reduce long-term costs.  \n   - **Why here?**: As soon as they understand cost basics, they learn how “resource-efficient investments” play into the same calculations.\n\n5. **Enhanced COGS Slide (Integrated COGS Calculator)**  \n   - Transition from the ROI Calculator into an **enhanced COGS table**.  \n   - **Why here?**: After seeing the ROI concept, they can apply it directly to typical cost items—comparing standard vs. efficient alternatives.\n\n6. **NEW: No-Regrets Decision Framework**  \n   - After participants see examples of efficiency ROI in actual line items, give them the **decision-making tool** that ties cost reduction, risk mitigation, and customer values together.  \n   - **Why here?**: By placing the framework at the end of the cost discussion, you equip them to make decisions about CAPEX, OPEX, and efficiency measures (all of which have been introduced).\n\n7. **Salaries / SG&A Deep Dive** (Existing)  \n   - If you have a dedicated section on SG&A, you can keep it here.  You might add references to risk or efficiency if you wish.\n\n8. **Conclusion / Q&A** (Existing)  \n   - Summarize how resource efficiency and no-regrets decisions fit seamlessly into the cost model.\n\n**Result**: \n1. Intro  \n2. Types of Costs  \n3. COGS Explanation  \n4. **Resource Efficiency ROI** (new)  \n5. **Enhanced COGS** (replacing old COGS slide or as an addition)  \n6. **No-Regrets Decision Framework** (new)  \n7. Salaries / SG&A (existing)  \n8. Conclusion  \n\n---\n\n## **Balance Sheet Deck: Proposed Slide Order**\n\n1. **Title / Introduction**  \n   - Retain your current intro slides explaining what a Balance Sheet is and how it differs from a P&L.\n\n2. **Balance Sheet Basics** (Existing)  \n   - Where you walk through the formula *Assets = Liabilities + Equity*.\n\n3. **NEW: Balance Sheet with Efficiency Assets**  \n   - Incorporate a **sample** that shows “Resource Efficiency Assets” (e.g., solar panels, water systems) under “Fixed Assets.”  \n   - **Why here?**: Immediately after the standard formula, show a real-world view of how those “eco-assets” appear on the balance sheet.\n\n4. **NEW: Resilience Metrics Dashboard**  \n   - Present metrics like **Cash Ratio**, **Resource Efficiency %**, and **Supply Diversity**.  \n   - **Why here?**: Right after showing them the updated balance sheet, reveal **how** to interpret it through a resilience lens (financial + sustainability).\n\n5. **Changes Over Time / Investment or Loans** (Existing)  \n   - Continue with your existing slides that demonstrate how the balance sheet changes when the startup receives funding or loans—just keep referencing how those new funds might go into efficiency assets.\n\n6. **Conclusion / Q&A** (Existing)  \n   - End with how a resilient balance sheet fosters **long-term viability**.\n\n**Result**: \n1. Intro  \n2. Balance Sheet Basics  \n3. **Balance Sheet with Efficiency Assets** (new/enhanced)  \n4. **Resilience Metrics Dashboard** (new)  \n5. Investment / Loans (existing)  \n6. Conclusion  \n\n---\n\n## **How the New Slides Transition**\n\n### **Cost Model Deck**\n\n1. **Introduce standard cost concepts**  \n2. **Immediately show how sustainability (Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator) loops in**  \n3. **Enhance the existing COGS slide** to demonstrate practical changes (bulk purchases, eco-materials, etc.)  \n4. **Wrap up** with the **No-Regrets Framework**, a universal “checklist” to help participants decide if a cost is wise from multiple standpoints.  \n\n### **Balance Sheet Deck**\n\n1. **Start with the fundamentals** so no one is lost.  \n2. **Demonstrate a real-life balance sheet** that includes “Efficiency Assets”—showing exactly where those appear in fixed assets.  \n3. **Use the Resilience Metrics Dashboard** to interpret that updated balance sheet: Is the business stable if a crisis hits? Are we investing enough in energy security?  \n4. **Tie it back** to how new investments or loans might appear on the sheet and why a portion could be dedicated to resource efficiency.  \n\n---\n\n## **Linking to the Financial Model Spreadsheet**\n\n- **After** each new slide in both decks, reference the specific **tabs or cells** in the spreadsheet:\n  - **Cost Model → Resource Efficiency ROI Tab**:  \n    - Show how the “Initial Cost” and “Payback Period” from the ROI slide ties back to the CAPEX or intangible assets in the **Financial Model**.\n  - **No-Regrets Decision Framework**:  \n    - Encourage participants to create a small scoring or “yes/no” matrix in the **Financial Model** for each expense line item.\n  - **Balance Sheet with Efficiency Assets**:  \n    - In the **Financial Model**’s Balance Sheet tab, add a row for “Eco-Assets.”  \n    - Demonstrate where monthly cost savings show up in the **Income Statement** or **Cash Flow** tabs.\n  - **Resilience Metrics Dashboard**:  \n    - Introduce a new, final **“Resilience Metrics”** tab that calculates **cash ratio**, **eco-asset ratio**, **liquidity** after each major investment, etc.\n\n---\n\n## **Why This Order Works**\n\n1. **Minimal Disruption**: You keep your existing logical flow, simply **inserting** new slides where they fit most naturally (right after you introduce a concept that the new slide enhances).  \n2. **Immediate Application**: You present the **ROI calculator** and **No-Regrets framework** while participants are actively thinking about costs, so they see the **practical** connection.  \n3. **Straightforward Progression**: The **Balance Sheet** deck still goes from basic definitions → *enhanced example* → *analysis metrics*. Participants see a step-by-step build-up, rather than random “extra” slides.  \n4. **Clear Resilience Connection**: By the time participants reach the **Balance Sheet with Efficiency Assets** and the **Resilience Metrics Dashboard**, they already understand **why** we track these (because of what they learned in the Cost Model about efficiency ROI).\n\n---\n\n## **Final Tips**\n\n- **Use consistent styling** (colors, icons) for “resilience” or “efficiency” across all new slides so participants notice the pattern.  \n- In your **facilitator notes**, highlight each new slide’s **purpose** (“This slide shows your cost savings from resource efficiency,” “This slide demonstrates how no-regrets decisions pay off,” etc.).  \n- End both decks with a **summary** linking the new slides: “We saw how cost decisions (like solar panels) reduce monthly expenses; now on the balance sheet, we track them as assets and measure resilience.”  \n\n---\n\n### **Sample Final Flow (Short Version)**\n\n**Cost Model Deck**  \n1. Introduction  \n2. Types of Costs (Fixed, Variable, COGS, SG&A)  \n3. Calculating COGS (Examples)  \n4. **(NEW)** Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator  \n5. **(UPDATED)** COGS Slide with Efficient Alternatives  \n6. **(NEW)** No-Regrets Decision Framework  \n7. Salaries & SG&A  \n8. Conclusion  \n\n**Balance Sheet Deck**  \n1. Introduction (What is a Balance Sheet?)  \n2. Basic Structure: Assets = Liabilities + Equity  \n3. **(NEW)** Balance Sheet with Efficiency Assets  \n4. **(NEW)** Resilience Metrics Dashboard  \n5. Funding/Investments (How the Balance Sheet Changes)  \n6. Conclusion  \n\nBy following this order, the **new slides** are positioned for maximum clarity and impact, giving participants a coherent story of **how** resource efficiency, risk reduction, and no-regrets decisions flow through costs → financial statements → overall business resilience.",

Here are some alternative names along with ways to rework the slide:\n\n---\n\n## **Alternative Titles**\n1. **\"Smart Investment Framework\"**  \n   → Emphasizes **strategic** and **well-calculated** business choices.\n2. **\"Resilient Decision Framework\"**  \n   → Highlights **risk mitigation** and **long-term stability**.\n3. **\"Value-Driven Decision Framework\"**  \n   → Aligns with **customer values, efficiency, and financial impact**.\n4. **\"Sustainable Business Choices Guide\"**  \n   → Centers on **efficiency, risk, and sustainability**.\n5. **\"Strategic Cost-Benefit Analysis\"**  \n   → Focuses on **assessing business choices with clear financial logic**.\n6. **\"Future-Proof Decision Framework\"**  \n   → Communicates **long-term viability** and **avoiding future issues**.\n\n---\n\n## **Reworked Slide Example**\n### **Strategic Cost-Benefit Framework**\n  \n#### **Before making a financial decision, consider:**\n\n✔ **Does it improve efficiency?**  \n   → Lowers operational costs and maximizes resources  \n\n✔ **Does it reduce risk?**  \n   → Mitigates supply chain disruptions, price volatility, or regulatory changes  \n\n✔ **Does it enhance customer value?**  \n   → Strengthens brand loyalty, sustainability perception, or premium pricing potential  \n\n---\n\n### **Example: Packaging Redesign**\n| Factor            | Impact |\n|------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Efficiency**    | Reduces material waste by 20%, saving $0.15 per unit |\n| **Risk Reduction** | Less reliance on single-use plastics, avoiding potential future regulations |\n| **Customer Value** | Aligns with consumer demand for sustainability, allowing for a potential price premium |\n\n**Recommendation:** ✅ Proceed (3-month payback period, reduced costs, and improved brand perception)\n\n---\n\n## **Why This Works**\n- This **keeps the core intent** of the \"No-Regrets\" concept but **makes it sound more strategic and actionable**.  \n- Using terms like **\"Strategic\"**, **\"Future-Proof\"**, and **\"Resilient\"** makes it feel more like a **business leadership decision-making tool**.  \n- The **structured checklist** makes it easier to apply to **real-world business cases**.  \n\nWould you like me to tweak this further based on your audience's preferences?",

      "content": "### **Improvements for Your CAPEX Sheet in the Financial Model Table**\nYour **Capital Expenditures (Capex) & Depreciation** sheet is solid but can be **improved for better clarity, strategic decision-making, and integration** with efficiency and resilience factors.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Issues in the Current Sheet**\n### **1. Lack of Categorization for Better Clarity**\n- No clear breakdown of **Tangible vs. Intangible Assets** (e.g., software vs. equipment).\n- No differentiation between **Revenue-Generating Assets** vs. **Supporting Infrastructure**.\n\n### **2. Missing Efficiency & Sustainability Factors**\n- No way to track **how efficiency investments reduce operating costs**.\n- No **ROI & Payback Period column** to justify Capex decisions.\n\n### **3. No Risk or Resilience Indicators**\n- Some assets **depreciate faster than others**, impacting financial stability.\n- No way to assess **risk exposure if a critical asset fails**.\n\n### **4. No Forecast for Replacement & Upgrades**\n- No visibility into **when major assets need replacing**.\n- No structured method to **plan future Capex investments**.\n\n---\n\n## **Step-by-Step Improvements**\n### **1. Improve Asset Categorization (Tangible vs. Intangible, Critical vs. Non-Critical)**\nAdding **categorization columns** improves clarity and strategic planning.\n\n#### **Before**\n| Current Asset | Current Value | Useful Life (Years) |\n|--------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| Equipment    | $5,000       | 5                  |\n| Software     | $2,000       | 3                  |\n\n#### **After**\n| Current Asset | Type (Tangible/Intangible) | Critical?

Last week we took a look at your revenue streams to try and forecast revenues for the next three years, and today we will look at the other side, which are your costs. You can’t run a business without incurring some expenses along the way. You usually need to pay to create and deliver value to your customer segments. We will spend this session breaking down the different types of costs and forecasting those like we did for your revenues. \n\nAsk: Why is it important to have a clear picture of your costs before you start your business?\nPotential answers could be:\nEven if you are making sales and your situation is good, if you can’t control your costs, your profitability or cash flow could be ruined. \nIt is necessary for planning. If you want to hit a certain number of sales, you should think about what you need to do to actually make those sales (and what you need to spend). \nBy laying out your costs, you can think more strategically about new systems or techniques to lower them (maybe through partnerships or new and innovative systems)\n\nProfit and loss\n  Revenue model\n  Cost model\n\nBalance sheet \n  Assets \n  Liabilities\n  Owner’s equity\n\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nRecap: Last we worked on the revenue model.

Can someone give me a few examples \nWrite all answers on the whiteboard or Jamboard. \nGroup answers so that you get categories for COGS, salaries, and SG&A (you can have other groups if necessary). \nPotential Answer\nEntrepreneurs will give a variety of answers, write them all down.\nGroup their answers to highlight the costs below:\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS): Direct costs of producing an item sold by a company (e.g., materials, direct labor).\nSalaries: Team and staff payments (if directly tied to production, might be COGS).\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A): Indirect costs like rent, marketing, and overhead.\nConsider your costs strategically, they represent what you care about and communicate that to your customers:\nCosts reflect values: Do you prioritize efficiency, quality, or resilience?\nEfficiencies save money over time: Smart investments (e.g., longer-lasting materials, reducing waste, energy-efficient choices) can lower costs long-term.\nExample: Switching to LED lights may have an upfront cost but reduces long-term electricity expenses.\nActivity Prompt (Discussion 5-10 min):\nWhat costs matter most to your business?\nHow could aligning with values help manage risks and costs?\nExample: If your priority is operational efficiency, would bulk ordering, material choices, or equipment upgrades help lower costs over time?\nGroup responses into COGS, Salaries, SG&A as before.\n1 minute: Transition\nToday, we will talk in more detail about COGS, Salaries, and SG&A.  These are these are key categories in your profit and loss statement.\nNext week we will go deeper in your start up costs, including capital expenditure vs. operating expenditure..\n\n6\n\nCOGS\n40 minutes: Lecture, brainstorm, demonstration (this includes hidden slides 7-11)\n\nThe first thing we will go over are the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Again COGS are the direct costs of producing an item sold by a company. This includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the product itself. \nSo for example, if you sell T-shirts, you need to calculate the cost of actually producing that item. Whether you are buying it from someone else, or producing it from scratch, these costs have to be accounted for.\n\n\n30 minutes: Brainstorm \nWe will do two examples together on the board (a very simple example and a complex one).\nThe entrepreneurs should lead the conversation and figure out how to calculate the unit economics of the examples (the price of one scoop of ice cream for example) \nThe hidden slides 7-10 are for trainers to go deeper on how to facilitate the discussion for each part of the COGS calculation (keep in mind that the slides are animated so might have a few layers of information).\n\n5 minutes: Example 1 (simple)\nHow do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business? – slide 7\nGive background info on business:\nYou know a tub of ice cream costs you $9 to buy from your supplier\nIt also costs you $1 per container to put your own label on the tub ice cream (this is agreed to with the supplier). \nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell\nAsk: What if you don’t sell ice cream by the tub, you sell it by the scoop?\nAnswer: We need to figure out how many scoops are in 1 tub of ice cream, then divide. \nLet’s say there are 100 scoops of ice cream in a tub\n$10/100 scoops = $1 per scoop\n\n5 minutes Example 2 (advanced): \nThat was easy right? What if you don’t know the price of a tub of ice cream? – Slides 7-11\nAsk: What would you do to calculate the cost of 1 scoop?\nGo through a detailed example of calculating the costs of something from scratch. In hidden slides 7-11 we go through how to calculate the price of 1 scoop of ice cream. The general layout is as follows:\nIdentify what goes into making the item (identify all the supplies/ingredients) –Slide 8\nIdentify the price of everything you buy (that goes into what you are making) – Slide 8\nFigure out how much of each ingredient you use (what you buy vs what you use) – Slides 8 & 9 \nLink unit cost to sales – Slide 10 & 11\n\n10-15 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \n7\n\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nItem\nNormal cost \nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\nDay Tour\n$90.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\nItem\nNormal cost \nBulk order price\nBulk order requirement\nDelivery fee (charged on business)\nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\n$5.00\n30\n$2.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nDay Tour\n$90.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n40 minutes: Brainstorm + demonstration\n\nCalculating COGS can be simple or highly complex depending on the product.\nA basic approach: Make a simple chart to highlight how much each unit costs your business.\n\nSimple examples:\nExample: How do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business?\nGive background info on business:\nA tub of ice cream costs $9 from your supplier.\nLabeling adds $1 per tub.\nTotal COGS per tub: $10.\nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell \n\nAnother example: A t-shirt costs you $5 +$2 delivery cost. You would put the sale type as a T-shirt and the unit cost is $7. \n\nActivity (30 min):\nDevelop your COGS, and then consider a strategic change that might be able to reduce costs\nStep 1: Calculate COGS for your business.\nStep 2: Identify one strategic tweak (e.g., bulk purchase, green sourcing, supplier negotiation) that could lower costs long-term.\nDiscussion: Where in your production costs can you improve efficiency? Would bulk purchasing, different suppliers, or alternative materials reduce costs?\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration \nGo onto the financial model and show the simple COGS calculation chart. (Old, will remove)\nPoint out areas that can add to your COGS such as delivery, bulk orders, maybe you can add something like product customization, etc…  (Old, will remove)\n\nIf you are not calculating any COGS, feel free to remove these rows altogether.\n\n\n8\n\n We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream.\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurement used when making the product)\nPrice\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n(10-15 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nLet’s take the example of an ice cream shop.\nAsk: We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream. There are several ways to do this, so lets think about how we want to approach this.\nHave a discussion on the board to see if the class can figure out how to determine how much a tub of ice cream costs, or even one ice cream cone. Guide the entrepreneurs to calculate this on the whiteboard before showing them the answer.\nManage the flow of the discussion to cover the following points:\nTo make it easier, first let’s see how much it would cost us to make a tub of ice cream. You would never make 1 scoop of ice cream, you make a large amount and then sell the scoops individually. So lets say that in our tub of ice cream, there are 100 scoops.\nFirst figure out the ingredients you need to make this tub of ice cream. Write down all of the ingredients you would need to make ice cream on the white board (it is ok to estimate). \nPotential answers could be:\nSugar\nMilk\nSalt\nOreos\nEtc….\nWhen you buy this ingredient, how much do your buy (1 kilo, 1 package, 100 pieces, etc…). Write that down next to the ingredient itself.\nHow much did you pay for the ingredients? Write that down as well so you can calculate how much you actually spend\nTransition to next slide: Great, the first steps are done, now what do we do? \n\nNote to trainer: We are not ice cream experts, so we are going to stay simple for now. If this was really a business we are working on, we would need to calculate the real costs and know the real ingredients. This is just a simple example so we are making some things up.\nIt is ok, if the group comes up with a different answer from the example shown. \n\n9\n\nBut I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! \nI won’t have accurate costs estimates!\n  COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurment used when making the product)\nPrice\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\n800\n$2.56\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\n5\n$4.00\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\n10\n$1.25\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\n5\n$1.56\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\n20\n$3.00\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\n0.5\n$0.30\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\n$     -\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n100\n$12.00\n(5-10 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6 \n\nSome entrepreneurs might point out “But I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! I won’t have accurate cost estimates!”. Make sure to explain how to accurately calculate COGS considering the fact that they won’t use all of their ingredients.\nMake sure when you write out the quantity you are buying, you convert it to the measurements that you will use when making the ice cream. For example, you buy 1 Kilo of sugar, but you cook with cups, so write it out as 5 cups as well (as you can see in the image). \nThe next step is to write down how much of the ingredient you use to make a tub of ice cream. From all that information, you can find the amount you spend on just the ingredients you use. This means you can use the rest of your ingredients and not miscount your costs.\nIf each tub has about 100 scoops, you can divide the tub price by 100 to get the cost per scoop.\nNow you know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream!\n\nTransition: \nAsk: What do you guys think is the next step? Now that we know how much 1 scoop of ice cream, what do we use that information for?\nWe need to see how much we are spending month to month to produce the ice-cream that we are selling\nMultiply price per scoop by the number of ice cream sales. \nThis is what is known as a variable cost. \n\n\n10\n\n# of ice cream scoops produced\nCALCULATING VARIABLE COSTS\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY \nFEBRUARY\nBranded T-Shirt\n20\nIce cream scoop\n300\n315\nSweet drink\n300\n315\n(10 minutes: Discussion) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nAsk: What do you guys know about variable costs? Have the class share what they know on the topic.\nPotential answers: \nThere are fixed costs and variable costs. \nFixed costs stay the same month to month. Variable costs change.\nIf you produce more, it costs you more. \n\nAsk: If it costs us $.25 for one scoop of ice cream, and we sell 300 scoops in January, how much are the Ice cream related COGS in January?\nAnswer: $74\nAs we increase our ice cream sales, we also increase the COGS related to ice cream.\nIn the financial model, you should link your sales with COGS to calculate your variable costs.\n\n\nAsk: What other things can be variable in your business?\nPotential answers: \nDelivery of your item (each item sold needs to be delivered- you can link this to sales as in COGS calculation)\nDirect labor for your product/service (if not paid a salary)\nIf you offer something (like a gift) with every purchase\nTransportation\nAdvertising\nEtc…\n\nQuestion that might come up: \nHow do we forecast variable costs that aren’t linked to sales?\nWe will approach variable costs in 2 ways. \nWe will link costs to sales. As sales grow, some of your variable costs grow with them\nFor the items that are variable that we can’t link to sales and easily forecast. We are going to estimate how much we would want to spend on those items. For example, although advertising can be variable (you can spend as much as you want on it), we are going to treat it like a fixed cost and set a budget for ourselves and not spend over that amount. \n\n11\n\nCALCULATING COGS\nTOTAL COGS\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nIce Cream Costs\n74\n78\n82\n86\nT-Shirt Costs\n-\n240\n-\n240\nSweet Drink Costs\n834\n876\n919\n965\nTotal COGS\n$74\n$318\n$82\n$326\n(3 minutes: Lecture + demonstration) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nCalculating the actual costs shown on P&L:\nNow based on the unit price of an item, and the amount old, you can easily calculate the actual COGS. \nThis is broken down month to month and can also be broken down product to product.\nThe more detailed you are in your work, the more detailed and accurate the results will be.\nThe COGS will generate automatically into your P&L if you don’t add or remove rows. \nIf you add/remove rows, make sure to look at the formulas to ensure they add up correctly.\nThe trainer can show exactly how this works by doing it on the actual Google sheet.\n12\n\nGross Profit = Revenues - COGS\nGROSS PROFIT\n2018A\n2019A\n2020A\n2021E\n2022E\nREVENUES\nSales\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 120,000\n$ 200,000\nServices\n$ 20,000\n$ 40,000\nOther Income\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 140,000\n$ 240,000\nCOGS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,400\n$ 8,820\n$ 9,261\n$ 9,724\nGROSS PROFIT\n$ 19,000\n$ 36,000\n$ 71,180\n$ 130,739\n$ 230,276\nEXPENSES\nSG&A\n$ 12,000\n$ 12,600\n$ 13,230\n$ 13,892\n$ 14,586\nSalaries\n$ 15,000\n$ 15,750\n$ 16,538\n$ 17,364\n$ 18,233\nOther expenses\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL EXPENSES\n$ 35,000\n$ 36,750\n$ 38,588\n$ 40,517\n$ 42,543\nPROFIT/LOSS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,250\n$ 41,413\n$ 99,483\n$ 197,457\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nTo place us back onto the P&L, let’s see where we are and what we have done so far.\nGo through the P&L statement up until Gross profit\nWe have talked about our revenues. Here we can see how our different revenue streams are highlighted. \nNext, we want to calculate our COGS. We have just learned how to do that.\nNext, we have gross profit. Gross profit is the money that a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its products, or the costs associated with providing its services. This means your total revenues – COGS.\nQuiz the group and ask something like:\nIf you made $1,000 selling hats and your hats cost you $200 to make and deliver to your customer, what is your gross profit? \nAnswer: $800\n\nAsk: How many of you need to calculate COGS in one way or another?\nSome people might raise their hands, others might not. \nCOGS won’t be relevant for everyone. In reality, your COGS are only one type of expense. In the next slides, we are going to take a look at how to calculate the other parts (which will be relevant for everyone). \n\nRecap: You need to calculate the COGS for your business (if relevant) in order to get an accurate picture of your expenses, you should understand the unit economics of your business. This is how much it costs you to produce 1 unit of whatever it is that you are selling. \n\n\n\n\n13\n\nSALARIES\n10-15 minutes: Brainstorm + discussion\n\n3 minutes: Lecture\nAs you mentioned previously, another cost that we need to consider are staff salaries. Your team is an essential part of your business, but they can often be costly. You need to evaluate who should be on your team, when to hire them, and how much you need to pay them! These are strategic questions because you usually need staff to create and sell your product, but you don’t want to hire unnecessary people. You can use the finance tool to help plan when the best time to hire employees are. \n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\nWe will do an example together on the board and then I will show you how to apply it on your cost assumptions tab of the financial model.\nThe brainstorm/explanation should be done on a whiteboard or Jamboard. \n\nExample:  Calculating salaries\nAsk: What is the best way to approach figuring out our costs related to salaries?\nStep 1: Figure out who you need to hire\nSome things are obvious. You already know who to hire\nLook at your sales forecast. Who do you need to actually reach that target? Don’t hire someone until you need them\nFind interns and students who could volunteer instead of hiring someone\nTake more responsibilities on yourself\nNote to trainer: We will go over hiring in more detail in the LEAD sessions\nStep 2: Estimate their salary\n\nStep 3: Figure out when you want to hire and how many people\n\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \nPoints to bring up include:\nAs entrepreneurs are answering that question, show them these parts of the model:\nBlue: The job title of the person you need. \nOrange: The salaries for each person. Make sure you write your own salary as well. Put a number that you actually deserve (what is your worth?)!\nMonth to month in orange: The number of that particular employee you will hire for that given month (for example, 1 CEO, 2 interns, etc…). If your salary is too high, remember you don’t have to pay yourself at the beginning or you can take half of your salary (type in .5 in the month to month box – shown in the first row of the second picture under October and November). \n\n\n\n14\n\nPRACTICE\n\nAdd your employees into your financial model!\n15 minutes: Activity\n\n2 minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work on their own model and input information for their salaries. \nWe will not apply the COGS directly because it does not relate to everyone, but this is a good time for them to apply some of the new knowledge onto their business.\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nSet the timer for 8-10 minutes and let entrepreneurs work on their model.\nThe trainer should go around to answer any questions or help when needed. \nTrainers should make sure to point out if they want to hire someone who might not be necessary at this point. You can suggest to hire them maybe in year 2 or 3 (show them on the model how that would work)\n\n\n\nSELLING, \u000bGENERAL, & ADMINISTRATIVE\n15 minutes: Discussion + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nHave a brief discussion on selling, general, and administrative costs (SG&A). These are costs that are not directly related to production or salaries but are essential for business operations.\nOk, so we are clear on COGS and salaries, now what about all of your other costs? Where do they go? \nWe will put all of your other costs (except for startup costs) under SG&A.\nThe SG&A category can encompass all of your other expenses that we haven’t accounted for yet. \nAsk: What are the other expenses that are left that we still need to account for?\nPotential answers can be:\nRent\nOverhead (ongoing expenses of operating your business)\nAdvertising\nSupplies\nLawyer fees\nAccountant\nUtilities\nWorkspace efficiency\nOperational tools to reduce costs over time.\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nDemonstrate how the finance tool works:\nCategories: You have already mentioned a few of the categories that can be listed in here. These can be larger categories broken down into specific expenses. For example, you can see that I have advertising listed here. Instead of just saying $160 will be spent on advertising, you want to think about how you will actually advertise. Think about where your customers are and how you can best reach them. In this case I chose Facebook promotions, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and printed materials. You should think of every expense you will need to pay out over the coming years and write it out. \nMonth to month expenses: You can highlight how much you plan on spending every month for each category. Take a look at your sales targets per month and consider how much you would have to spend to get there. Be as realistic as possible. \nFor example, If you spend $100 on a Facebook advertisement, how many views will that generate? How many people typically look at an ad before converting into a sale? If you are only spending a small amount of money on 1 form of advertising, don’t expect a ton of sales! \nYoY growth: The year over year (YoY) growth box allows you to set a standard growth rate for your expenses. You should assume that you will be spending more on expenses every year because of the rise in prices or because you are spending more as you grow. You can choose to use this method or not depending on the situation of that expense item. \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nAre these fixed or variable costs?\nSome of them are fixed and some of them are variable. Things like rent are fixed all the time. Maybe there is a price increase, but for the most part you know that it will be the same month to month.\nFor some of the others such as advertising, meeting expenses, and so on, these are variable, but if you plan ahead and budget for them, you can treat them as a fixed cost. You can say that you will only spend $100 on _____ per month or something like that. Remember that we want to plan as accurately as possible. \n\n.\n16\n\nPROFIT AND LOSS\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nYEAR 3\nSALES\nProducts\n26,276\n72,604\n127,752\nSubscriptions\n6,364\n11,428\n20,523\nTOTAL SALES:\n$ 46,965\n$ 84,032\n$ 148,276\nEXPENSES\nCOGS\n17,333\n29,635\n49,097\nSalaries\n19,700\n49,000\n92,400\nSG&A\n8,820\n12,945\n13,166\nTOTAL EXPENSES:\n$45,853\n$91,580\n$154,663\nNET INCOME:\n$2,622\n$7,548\n$6,387\n5 minutes: Demonstration + discussion\n\nStay on the financial model and show the profit and loss summary tab.\nFinally, now that all the costs are accounted for, you can see the completed P&L.\nShow how it is all linked to that one page. \nIf you look at the P&L summary tab, you can see all your information at a very high level.

How can you use the information here to be a better manager?\nPotential answers:\nThis tab can be very insightful for you or anyone else evaluating your financials. \nGet a very clear summary of all the details of where you are doing well and where you are suffering. \nYou can see if your costs/revenues are super high or low. \nFor example, salaries are posing a big problem here. They are so expensive and are growing fast!\nYou can easily see if there is an error somewhere on your financials on this page, you know where to go to solve it or fix the formula\nYou can see your growth and profitability over time. Are you being realistic? Are you over or undervaluing yourself? \nWhen you start to really track information, this can be helpful to help you know where to cut costs or be more efficient. \nIf these numbers are interesting enough, an investor might ask how you plan on doing it, which could lead to a longer conversation with them\nAlternatively, an investor might look at them and be turned off right away.\n\n\n17\n\nResource Efficiency ROI Calculator\nInvestment\nInitial Cost\nAnnual Savings\nPayback (months)\n3-Year ROI\nRisk Reduction\nSolar Panels\n$3,000\n$960\n38\n60%\nEnergy price stability\nLED Lighting\n$500\n$240\n25\n144%\nLower maintenance\nWater Systems\n$800\n$300\n32\n113%\nResource security\nAppears on Balance Sheet as: Fixed Assets \u000bReduces Monthly Expenses by: $125 \u000bCustomer Value: Brand differentiation, price stability\n[[[needs facilitator notes]]]\n18\n\nPRACTICE\n\nHow can you make this business more profitable?\n45 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\nBreak the room into small groups of 3-5 people\nAllow entrepreneurs to go somewhere comfortable to work as a group\nEvery group will get an example P&L statement to work on as a group (Old, will remove)\nThe P&L statement will not be profitable (Old, will remove)\nEvery group will receive an example Profit & Loss (P&L) statement that is not profitable.\nEach group needs to evaluate the statement and make it profitable.

It introduces the concept of **payback periods, ROI, and risk reduction** for capital investments in resource-efficient systems.\n\n#### **Key Points to Cover:**  \n1. **Strategic Investments:**  \n   - Some business expenses are not just costs but **investments** that **save money over time** (e.g., solar panels, LED lighting, water-saving systems).  \n   - These investments improve **efficiency, lower operating costs, and enhance sustainability**.\n\n2. **Understanding the Metrics:**  \n   - **Initial Cost:** The upfront investment required to implement the improvement.  \n   - **Annual Savings:** The amount of money saved per year due to the investment.  \n   - **Payback Period:** The time it takes for the savings to **cover the initial cost** (calculated as Initial Cost ÷ Annual Savings).  \n   - **3-Year ROI:** The return on investment over three years, expressed as a percentage:  \n     \\[\n     \\left( \\frac{(\\text{Annual Savings} \\times 3) - \\text{Initial Cost}}{\\text{Initial Cost}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]  \n   - **Risk Reduction:** Investments in efficiency **reduce financial risks** (e.g., energy price fluctuations, resource scarcity, maintenance costs).\n\n3. **How it Appears in Financial Statements:**  \n   - **Balance Sheet:** These investments are listed under **Fixed Assets**.  \n   - **Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement:** They reduce **monthly expenses** by lowering utility or operational costs.  \n   - **Customer Perception:** Many efficiency upgrades improve a company's **brand reputation and customer trust** (e.g., sustainability efforts).\n\n#### **Facilitation Approach:**  \n- **Ask:** How many of you have considered making strategic efficiency investments in your business?  \n- **Discussion:**  \n  - Which efficiency improvements could benefit your business?  \n  - Would you prioritize **short-term payback** or **long-term savings**?  \n- **Practical Application:**  \n  - Encourage entrepreneurs to **identify one investment** that could lower their costs long-term and integrate it into their financial model.  \n\n---\n\n### **Do We Need This Slide?**  \nThis slide is **valuable if** the goal is to **encourage entrepreneurs to think about smart long-term investments**. However, if it feels redundant or off-track from the core cost model session, consider **integrating efficiency investments into SG&A or Capex discussions** rather than having a separate slide.",

      "content": "Yes, it makes more sense to **move this slide to the Capex session** instead of keeping it in the cost model session.  \n\n### **Reasons to Move the Slide to Capex:**\n1. **Cost Model Focuses on Operational Costs:**  \n   - The cost model session is centered on **COGS, salaries, and SG&A**—expenses that occur regularly as part of running the business.  \n   - Strategic efficiency investments (like solar panels or water systems) are **capital expenditures (Capex),** which are usually one-time investments with long-term benefits.\n\n2. **Capex Session Covers Asset Investments & Depreciation:**  \n   - Capital expenditures (like energy-efficient lighting, machinery, or sustainability upgrades) **appear on the balance sheet** rather than being immediate operating expenses.  \n   - The **ROI and payback period** calculations fit better in a discussion on **financial planning for long-term investments** rather than the day-to-day cost model.\n\n3. **Streamlining the Cost Model Session:**  \n   - Keeping the cost model focused on **short-term and recurring expenses** makes it more digestible for entrepreneurs.  \n   - Entrepreneurs will have a clearer understanding of **what costs they can optimize today** (COGS, salaries, SG&A) vs. **what investments they should plan for later** (Capex).\n\n### **Next Steps:**  \n✅ **Remove the \"Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator\" slide from the Cost Model session.**  \n✅ **Integrate it into the Capex session, where it fits naturally into discussions on investment planning.**  \n✅ **Modify the facilitator notes accordingly for that session.**  \n\nWould you like me to help adjust the Capex session to incorporate this slide smoothly?",

      "content": "Yes, **\"Strategic Efficiency Investments\"** is also a **Capital Expenditure (Capex)** topic rather than an operational cost. It deals with **long-term investments in efficiency** (e.g., solar panels, LED lighting, water systems) that **reduce costs over time but require upfront spending.**  \n\nIt should be **moved to the Capex session** where it fits with discussions on **asset investments, depreciation, and ROI analysis.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Facilitator Notes: Strategic Efficiency Investments (Now in Capex Session)**  \n\n#### **Objective:**  \nExplain how **capital investments** in efficiency (e.g., energy-saving systems, water conservation, durable equipment) can **reduce long-term costs** and improve **financial sustainability.**  \n\n#### **Key Points to Cover:**\n- **What are Strategic Efficiency Investments?**  \n  - These are **one-time purchases** that reduce **ongoing operating expenses** over time.  \n  - Examples:  \n    - **Solar panels → reduce electricity costs**  \n    - **LED lighting → lower energy bills + fewer replacements**  \n    - **Water systems → cut down on water consumption and waste**  \n  - These appear on the **balance sheet as fixed assets** rather than day-to-day expenses.\n\n- **Why Do They Matter?**  \n  - While these require upfront spending, they **pay for themselves over time** through **cost savings** and potentially **increased brand value.**  \n  - They **reduce financial risk** by making costs more predictable (e.g., protection from rising energy prices).  \n  - Some investments can also **improve customer perception** (e.g., sustainable businesses attract more eco-conscious customers).\n\n- **How to Evaluate an Investment?**  \n  - **Payback Period = Initial Cost / Annual Savings**  \n    - Example: If LED lighting costs **$500** and saves **$240 per year**, the **payback period is ~2.1 years.**  \n  - **3-Year ROI (%) = (Total Savings Over 3 Years / Initial Cost) × 100**  \n    - Example: If solar panels cost **$3,000** and save **$960 per year**, the **3-year ROI is 96%**.  \n\n- **Decision-Making:**  \n  - Not all efficiency investments make sense for every business—consider:  \n    - **Can you afford the upfront cost?**  \n    - **How quickly will you break even?**  \n    - **What is the long-term benefit beyond just cost savings?**  \n\n---\n\n### **Suggested Slide Content (For Capex Session)**\n**Title: Strategic Efficiency Investments**  \n📌 Capital investments that **reduce long-term expenses & improve financial sustainability**  \n\n| Investment       | Initial Cost | Annual Savings | Payback (months) | 3-Year ROI (%) | Risk Reduction |\n|-----------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Solar Panels** | $3,000       | $960         | 38             | 60%          | Energy price stability |\n| **LED Lighting** | $500         | $240         | 25             | 144%         | Lower maintenance |\n| **Water Systems** | $800         | $300         | 32             | 113%         | Resource security |\n\n💡 **Strategic benefits:**  \n✅ **Appears on Balance Sheet as Fixed Assets**  \n✅ **Reduces Monthly Expenses by $XXX**  \n✅ **Improves Brand Perception & Long-Term Stability**  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n✅ Move this slide **to the Capex session.**  \n✅ Keep it as part of a **discussion on asset investments and long-term financial planning.**  \n✅ Remove it from the **Cost Model session** to avoid confusion with **operating expenses (COGS, Salaries, SG&A).**  \n\nWould you like me to adjust any other sections to ensure smooth transitions? 🚀",

How are you doing today? \nToday, we will go into our 3rd and final financial modelling session! We will focus on your balance sheet and your start up costs. \nWe will work on your financials together the whole time. Please stop me if you have any questions or more explanation because other people are probably having the same questions.\n\n1\n\nInclude your start-up budget into your financials.\nGet to know the balance sheet and begin making one. \nUnderstand how financials change with investment or loans.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nInclude your start-up budget into your financials.\nGet to know the balance sheet and begin making one.\nUnderstand how financials change with investment or loans.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nProfit and Loss\n  Revenue Model\n  Cost Model\n\nBalance Sheet \n  Assets \n  Liabilities\n  Owner’s Equity\n\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo where are we?\nAs you know, during the incubator, we will work on your financial model. This means that you will come out with a forecasted statement of profit and loss and also a balance sheet. We have already started and completed our statement of profit and loss!\nAsk: Can someone give me a brief overview of what it is (profit and loss)? \nPotential answers:\nRecording all the money coming in and going out (revenues- costs)\nCosts include COGS, SG&A, Salaries, etc…\nThey did it over a timespan of 3 years, but they can make it longer if they want.\nEtc…\n\nGreat, now we will work on your balance sheet! This highlights all the things that you have (assets) vs all of the things that you owe (liabilities). This will be forecasted over 3 years as well. \n\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nSalaries\nSelling, General, and Administrative (SG&A)\nStart Up Costs\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX)\nCapital Expenditure (CAP-EX)\nTYPES OF COSTS:\n2 minutes: Transition\n\nThe first step we will take to create your balance sheet is to outline what we have. Because most of us aren’t operating yet, we don’t have anything! Therefore, we are going to take the “what we have” part from our startup budget. We are going to create our balance sheet from the perspective that we get the investment that we need to launch. This means that “what you have” is based off of your startup costs (what they are \"going\" to receive).\nWe have already covered COGS, salaries, and SG&A. The last type of cost we will cover are the startup costs. We will also look at your startup costs and see if they are an operating expense or capital expenditure. We will go into detail of what these things mean later.\n\n4\n\nSTART UP BUDGET\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: We have already talked about how to make a startup budget during Ignite, but can someone just give us a brief recap of what it consists of? \nPotential answers (no need to talk about them all because this was covered already, but make sure they have a good understanding of what to include):\nBusinesses spend money before they open their doors. Start up expenses are those expenses incurred before your business is running, but contribute to the long term success of it.\nYou can include what you are planning to contribute into the business as well through your personal contribution.\nThe different things that you need to include in your start up budget can include:\nDevelopment costs: What you need to actually create and develop your product. This will really depend on what you are making. I listed some examples below, but it can be much more detailed than this.\nApp development\nWebsite development\nDomain and Hosting for 1 year\nInitial research and development\nLogo designer \nOffice, store, center, land rent for 6 months to a year (depending on how long you think it will take before you are profitable) \nFurniture/decoration\nConstruction/repairs/paint\nWebsite\nLogo design\nMachinery or tools\nInitial marketing:\nGrand opening event\nSocial media advertisements (when doing the budget, be specific on which platforms you will use and how much you will spend on each)\nFlyers, brochures, marketing material\nSignage \nInitial working capital: Any additional money you will needed to operate your business for the first 6 months to a year while you are still working to become profitable\nSalaries for the first few months\nOperational needs\nLegal fees:\nRegistration\nLawyer fees\nName registration\nIntellectual property and patents\nMaterials and supplies: \nThe first set of items that you need to sell\nMaterials needed to make the final product\nCleaning supplies\nPaper goods\nConsumables\n5\n\nSTART UP COSTS\nStart Up Costs\nAmount\nNotes\nRent\n$2,000\n4 months\nMarketing and Advertising\n$1,920\nMarketing materials, SEO, social media advertising\nApp Development\n$15,000\nNative android and IOS\nSignage\n$1,500\nOutdoor signage and decoration\nWebsite\n$2,500\nWebsite development\nCompany stamp\n$900\nLegal and Licensing\n$4,000\nLawyer to help register and provide legal services during the first year\nBank account\n$50\nBank fees\nOffice Supplies\n$200\nStaplers, hole punch, binders\nFile Cabinets\n$200\nDesk and Chairs\n$500\nReception and office desks\nComputer\n$1,500\nMac computer\nConsumales\n$500\nPaper, pens, ink catridges, other supplies\nTOTAL START-UP COSTS NEEDED:\n$30,770\nYOUR STARTUP BUDGET\nYEAR 1\nPERSONAL CONTRIBUTION\nPersonal Investment\nAmount\nNotes\nSalary\n$30,000\n$2,500/month for 1 year\nComputer\n$1,000\nTwo 3 year old Lenovo laptops\nFurniture\n$1,000\nLightly used office furniture\nPrinter\n$329\nHP Color Laserjet Pro\nPrinter Ink\n$500\n10 cartridges of ink\nTOTAL\n$32,829\n15 minutes: Demonstration + activity\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nDuring Ignite, we made a simple budget based on what you thought about your business at the time. A lot of this was made simply using assumptions. Now that you are much farther along on your business, I would like you to re-evaluate your budget and make one that reflects the new knowledge you have about your business. If you are still unsure of what you need to start your business, you need to do more research to really understand what this number would look like. \nGo onto the excel sheet and show the entrepreneurs exactly how to use the Startup Costs tab of the excel sheet.\nMake sure to explain the personal contribution! I pulled this out to show everything that the entrepreneur has invested in their own business. They should make sure to show any assets they are contributing because this will show up on their balance sheet. \nAsk: Why do you think that marketing and advertising white?\nLet them share their ideas\nAnswer: That square is white because it is a formula. If you look at where that number came from, it is from your assumptions page on the P&L. It is from the SG&A advertising total from year 1.  If you intend to have someone pay for all or part of your advertising, you need to make sure that this number matches your actual plan.\n\n5 minutes: Activity\nAsk everyone to take out their start up budget. \nTake the next 5 minutes to adjust your startup budget and put it into your financial model. \nJust focus on the columns called “Start-up Costs”, “Amount”, and “Notes”. Ignore the rest for now!\nThink about all of your costs necessary to start your business. \nNote down where you need to gather more information\nDon’t forget to add your personal contribution!\n\n\n\n\n\nCAP-EX OR OP-EX?\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX): Direct costs involved in day to day operation. These could be fixed or variable. These are operational costs that contribute to your business running normally. You probably have to pay for these things every month or on a frequent basis.\nAsk: Can someone give me a few examples of operational costs?\nPotential answers:\nMarketing and advertisements,\nTravel,\nRent,\nMeetings,\nSupplies, \nSalaries, \netc. \n\nCapital Expenditure: Capital expenditure, or CapEx, are funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets. These are one time purchases that relate to the long term business success (items that will last at least 1 year or longer). These items aren’t purchased frequently because they last a long time.\nAsk: Can someone give me a few examples of capital expenditures?\nPotential answers:\nComputers\nMachines\nLand/property\nFurniture\nIP/legal registration/patents\nEven the money you spend renovating your space count as CAP-EX\nOther investments that will last over 1 year\nEtc…\n\n\nResource Efficiency & CAP-EX, OP-EX\nResource efficiency investments can be either CAPEX or OPEX:\nCAPEX: Long-term assets that provide efficiency over time.\nExample: Solar panels (25+ years), energy-efficient equipment (5–10 years), water recycling systems (10+ years).\nOPEX: Short-term operational expenses that improve efficiency.\nExample: LED bulbs (if inexpensive), energy audits, staff training on conservation\nExample:\nA $3,000 solar panel investment is a CAPEX item that depreciates over 25 years, while an LED retrofit at $200 might be an OPEX cost.\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX): Direct costs involved in day to day operation.

Are these one time purchases or operational expenses?\nRent- Expense, (this is for 4 months so it is less than a year and doesn’t contribute to the long term value of your business)\nMarketing and advertising- Expense (this is for less than a year and doesn’t contribute to the long term value of your business (if it is flyers, social media advertisements, etc…). If you are purchasing roll ups, signs, investing in a logo or videos or other valuable long term assets, you can capitalize this. You can consider splitting it into 2 or more line items if you need)\nApp development- Capitalize (this will last several years and contribute to the long term success of your business)\nSignage- Capitalize (long term value)\nWebsite- Capitalize (long term value)\nYou will want to add up each category as well to see how you are spending your money (that is in the formula below the startup costs on the financial model)- You can see on the animation of this slide.\n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nGive the entrepreneurs 10 minutes to fill in their startup costs to say if they will capitalize or expense each item on their startup costs and their personal contribution (we will use this information in the next part).\nThe trainer should go around the room and make sure that everyone is doing it correctly and answer any questions.\n\n\nThe method of spreading the cost of an asset over the course of its useful life.\nAMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION\nWhy do this?\nSmaller impact on P&L\nMore accurate #’s\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + demonstration\n\nNow that we have a clear picture of our startup costs, and we have determined if we will expense or capitalize on them, we can move into the next part, Amortization & depreciation. Do remember seeing this on your P&L? We said we would get to it later. Now we are here!\n\nAmortization and depreciation are ways to spread the cost of an asset over the course of its useful life. \nBy doing this, you will have a smaller impact on your P&L. When you buy very expensive assets that aren’t typical in your yearly expenses, you don’t want them to reflect on your P&L. This will give people the wrong idea of what you are spending month to month to operate your business. If it shows up as an expense on your profit and loss, that will look bad for investors or other people interested in your company. You want to minimize the expenses on the P&L to look more profitable.\nStay as accurate as possible to understand month to month or year to year changes. If you have random large expenses in your P&L, you wont get an accurate picture of your normal spending habits. \n\nAmortization is a method of spreading the cost of an intangible asset over a specific period of time, which is usually the course of its useful life. Intangible assets are non-physical assets that are nonetheless essential to a company, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The goal in amortizing an asset is to match the expense of acquiring it with the revenue it generates.\nExample: Let's say a company spends $50,000 to obtain a license, and the license in question will expire in 10 years. Since the license is an intangible asset, it should be amortized for the 10-year period leading up to its expiration date. Using the straight-line method of amortization, which is a method for charging a cost to an expense at a consistent rate over time, the company's annual amortization expense for the license will be $5,000 (that's $50,000/10 years), meaning the asset will decline in value by $5,000 every year.\nDepreciation: Like amortization, depreciation is a method of spreading the cost of an asset over a specified period of time, typically the asset's useful life. The purpose of depreciation is to match the expense of obtaining an asset to the income it helps a company earn. Depreciation is used for tangible assets, which are physical assets such as manufacturing equipment, business vehicles, and computers. Depreciation is a measure of how much of an asset's value has been used up at a given point in time.\nExample: Let's say a company purchases a new piece of equipment with an estimated useful life of 10 years for the price of $100,000. Using the straight-line method, the company's annual depreciation expense for the equipment will be $10,000 ($100,000/10 years). This is important because depreciation expenses are recognized as deductions for tax purposes. It is also possible for a company to use an accelerated depreciation method, where the amount of depreciation it takes each year is higher during the earlier years of an asset's life.\n\nFor the purpose of simplicity, we are going to put everything under depreciation for now, but you can separate them on your financials if you would like to be more detailed. \n10\n\nLIFETIME VALUE OF ASSETS\nTYPE\nAMOUNT\nNOTES\nESTIMATED USEFUL LIFETIME VALUE (IN YEARS)\nINFORMATION USED FOR DEPRECIATION\nYearly value\nMonthly value\nExpense\n$ 2,000\n4 months\n<1 yr\nExpense\n$1,920\nMarketing materials, SEO, social media advertising\n<1 yr\nCapitalize\n$15,000\nNative android and IOS\n8\n$1,875\n$156.3\nCapitalize\n$1,500\nOutdoor signage and decoration\n5\n$300\n$25\nCapitalize\n$2,500\nWebsite development\n5\n$500\n$41.7\nCapitalize\n$900\n5\n$180\n$15\nCapitalize\n$3000\nSolar Panel Installation\n25\n$120\n$10\nINFORMATION USED IN DEPRECIATION\nYearly Depreciation\nMonthly Depreciation\n$3,750.3\n$312.5\n25 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm + demonstration\n\n10 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm\nSo how do we calculate the depreciation? That is easy! \nWe just add 1 more column of information which is “estimated useful lifetime value (in years)\nSo for each of your capitalized expenses, think about how long it will last. Write the number of years in the yellow space. \nSome of these things have international standards (for example, a computer is said to have a useful life of 5 years even though it will still work after that time), but you can always estimate if you don’t know. \nThen you take the value of the item and divide it by the number of years to find its yearly value.\nDo an example on the board!\nAsk: You bought a new computer that you bought for $500. What is the monthly and yearly depreciation value?\nStep 1: determine lifetime value: 5 years\nStep 2: Divide value by the number of useful years: $500/5=$100/year\nStep 3: Divide yearly value by 12 months: $100/12=$8.333\nAsk: What does this mean?\nEvery year, your computer will lose about $100 in value or $8.33 per year.\nThis is shown as an expense on your P&L as $8.33 month to month instead of $500 all at once!\nYou will do this for all of your capitalized assets to show a total yearly and monthly depreciation value (show animation). \n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nShow how to fill this information on the excel sheet.\nShow where it is all added up\nShow how the depreciation shows up on the P&L by going to row 35 on the Profit and Loss tab. We incur a cost of $313 every month instead of $28,629 all at once from your capitalized expenses. In cell S35, that number changes because you got another investment and increased your assets (shown at the bottom of the startup costs tab). \n\n10 minutes: Activity\nHave the entrepreneurs fill in the information for their business\nSome might be having trouble so go around and help anyone who is struggling.\n\n11\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: Does anyone know what a balance sheet is? How is it different from P&L? What information do you find here that you don’t get on your P&L?\nPotential answers:\nWhat you have vs what you owe: Everything you have was paid by something. Either debt, your personal money, or investment. The document shows how you financed the things your business has. \nA balance sheet is one of the three major business statements.\nIt shows what the business owns, what it owes, and the value of the owner's investment in the business.\nYour balance sheet is a snapshot of your business health. It is evaluated in a single point in time. A P&L is evaluated over time. You watch it change year to year. \nYour balance sheet shows your financial health in a single point of time. You don’t evaluate it over time like a P&L. Instead, you look at your assets and liabilities in a single point in time to understand your net worth. \nMany financial ratios use information in your balance sheet. With these ratios you can get a better idea of your financial health. \n12\n\nSales \nPromotion\nTotal Assets  \nTotal Liabilities  \nTotal owner’s equity\nTotal Assets = Total Liabilities + Total owner’s equity\nPREPARE YOUR BALANCE SHEET\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nIn theory it is a very simple document summed up by a simple formula. The difficult part is creating an accurate representation of each of these categories. \nAs we said before, the balance sheet shows what you have vs what you owe. \nEverything that you own (total assets) need to equal what you owe (total liabilities +owners equity). Everything you own was paid for by something. Either your personal contribution, investment, a loan, or even a gift or grant.\n13\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS\nMore information about the balance sheet with examples. They don’t record all of this on their balance sheet so it can be confusing for entrepreneurs. But it is good to understand all the other parts of a balance sheet for future recording. \n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nAssets are the things that you have. They can be long term or current (short term) assets. These assets contribute to the success of your business and are (hopefully) contributing to your long term growth!\nCurrent assets: This includes cash and things that can easily turn into cash. Things such as inventory can be easily turned into cash by selling the item. These things usually can be converted to cash within the year.\nCash: Cash in the bank is an asset!\nAccounts receivable: The amount of money that people owe you. Maybe you already delivered a product/service but haven’t received payment yet. This should be reported!\nInventory: Do you have a lot of items that are ready to be sold? You can include their value here.\nPrepaid rent: Did you already pay for something and the value of that item is still owed to you? You can also include this. This is the same as prepaid salaries or other non-monetary things owed to you. \nLong term assets: These are assets that have value, but they aren’t very liquid (can’t turn into cash easily). This includes things like machinery, property, technology, and other big investments.\nLand: Property is valuable and should be recorded as something that adds value in your business.\nBuildings & improvements: Not only can you count the physical building, but you can count how much you spent to improve the building. Maybe you build a handicap ramp, or installed walls, even painting the walls count here. They are all investments into your business that will last a long time and increase the value of your assets.\nFurniture & fixtures: These are things that you have invested into your business and should be accounted for.\nGeneral equipment: Machinery and other equipment are valuable parts of your business that help you generate revenues and operate!\n\n14\n\nSales \nPromotion\nLIABILITIES + OWNERS EQUITY\nMore information about the balance sheet with examples. They don’t record all of this on their balance sheet so it can be confusing for entrepreneurs. But it is good to understand all the other parts of a balance sheet for future recording. \n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nNow that we have shown exactly what we have, we need to show how we paid for it. You are either paying for your business with money you (and investors) put in in exchange for owners equity, or you take out a loan (debt). Between these two things, it shows exactly how you paid for all of your assets.\n\nWhat you owe:\nCurrent liabilities: These are things that you owe people within the year. If you borrow money from someone and you need to pay it back. Or if you buy something from a business and haven’t paid for it yet (and you owe them the money within the year). \nAccounts payable: This is the opposite of accounts receivable (shown as an asset). If you have received a product or service, but you still owe cash, you would need to show that.  Any time that you owe cash to or services to people, you would put it as a current liability. \nLong term liabilities: This is what you owe that you don’t have to pay back for at least a year. If you take out a loan, it will usually be under here.\nOwners equity: This covers your personal contribution to your business and also investment. It is the owners (including partners) money that they have invested. Additionally, all of the money that your business has generated through sales that you have retained from the previous years would be reported here as well (this will keep your growing cash balanced- How are you getting the increased amount of cash on your assets? Through the retained earnings under owner’s equity- you don’t owe this to anyone except shareholders of your business, including yourself). \n15\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET\nTYPES OF COSTS\nCapitalize\n$28,629\nExpense\n$34,970\nTOTAL COST\n$63,599\nYEAR 1: SUMMARY OF CAPITALIZED COSTS(ASSETS)\nTechnology\n$20,329\nFurniture\n$1,700\nOther\n$-\nTOTAL CAPITALIZED COSTS\n$22,029\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nAssets\nCash\n$42,352\n$43,702\n$45,204\n$46,784\nTechnology\n$20,329\n$20,329\n$20,329\n$20,329\nFurniture\n$1,700\n$1,700\n$1,700\n$1,700\nOther\nAccumulated Depreciation\n$313\n$625\n$938\n$1,250\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$64,069\n$65,106\n$66,296\n$67,563\n10 minutes: Lecture + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Lecture\nAsk: Where do you think we are going to calculate our assets from?\nAnswer: For simplicity sake, we are not going to break down the assets into all of the subcategories. We are doing a high level version. As you actually track your inventory and other assets over time, you can easily put that information into the balance sheet. We have a simplified balance sheet right now. We are only going to include the assets that you have reported as either your personal contribution or as your startup costs. If you have other assets that you want reported, include them in your personal contribution! You want to show that you are putting skin in the game as well! \nYou can see how we categorized our assets based on the startup costs:\nYour assets can be categorized in many different ways. It depends on your business. It is up to you to make sure the categories are correct. These are categorized by the information in my startup costs. I categorized my capitalized assets into 2 main categories “technology”, “furniture”, and added a third that I didn’t actually use “other”. After you look through your costs, make the best grouping for your business. You might want to include machinery or inventory if you are buying it in bulk\nShow how the startup costs, capitalized expenses, depreciation, and balance sheet all work together.\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nThe trainer should share their screen and show where exactly to put the start up costs through a demonstration\nMake sure to show where to write “capitalize” or “expense” (make sure that these are spelled correctly otherwise the formula won’t work properly)\nShow them the formula that will summarize their start up costs (showing total costs, total expensed costs, and total capitalized costs)\nShow at the bottom where it says “YEAR 1: SUMMARY OF CAPITALIZED COSTS (ASSETS)”,\nThis is where there is a formula that adds up operating and capital expenditures. \nYour capitalized expenses can be categorized in many different ways. It depends on your business. It is up to you to make sure the categories are correct. These are categorized by the information in my startup costs.

It is equal to the previous years net income. \nNet income: This is your bottom line reported month to month on your profit and loss tab. \nTotal equity: Your total equity is the sum of your capital, retained earnings, and net income.

Introduce the concept: \"Let's look at how certain investments can save money over time while reducing business risk.\"\n\n2. Walk through each example:\n   - \"Solar panels might cost $3,000 upfront, but save $80/month in electricity costs.\"\n   - \"LED lighting has a faster payback period of just over 2 years.\"\n   - \"Water systems reduce utility expenses while providing stability against water shortages.\"\n\n3. Point out the dual benefits:\n   - \"These appear as standard assets on your balance sheet.\"\n   - \"They generate ongoing savings that directly improve your P&L.\"\n   - \"They reduce business vulnerability to price increases and resource shortages.\"\n\nCONNECTING TO THE FINANCIAL MODEL (2 minutes):\n- \"These investments would be entered in the Capex tab under 'Solar Panels' which already has a 25-year useful life.\"\n- \"The monthly savings would reduce your utility expenses in the SG&A section.\"\n- \"This means the investment pays for itself and continues generating profit for years.\"\n\nDISCUSSION PROMPT (3 minutes):\n- \"What efficiency investments might make sense for your specific business?\"\n- \"Are there any existing costs that seem to increase every year that could be stabilized through an investment?\"\n\nKEY MESSAGE:\nEmphasize that this isn't about being \"green\" - it's about making smart business decisions that reduce ongoing costs while building resilience.\n19\n\nSales \nPromotion\nRESOURCE EFFICIENCY ROI\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nYEAR 3\n3-Year Total\nInvestment\t\n$3000\n$0\n$0\n$3000\nAnnual Savings\n$960\n$960\n$960\n$2880\nNet Benefit\n($2040)\n$960\n$960\n($120)\nCumulative Cash Flow\n($2040)\n($1080)\n($120)\n-\nPayback Period: 3.1 years\nROI after 5 years: 60%\n20\n\nHOW DOES IT CHANGE?\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: So how does this document change? What types of business activities would cause changes in this?\nPotential answers: \nIf assets or liabilities change\nYou might lose an asset or it decreases in value over time\nYou might buy a new asset. You would want to show that your business has increased in value. \nYou might also want to show how you paid for that asset (retained earnings, investment, debt, etc..)\n\nFacilitator Note:\n\"Let’s say you decide to invest in solar panels to reduce long-term electricity costs. This would show up as:\nInvestment: $3,000 (Solar Panels) added under Assets → Technology\nDepreciation Impact: $120/year or $10/month added to P&L → Depreciation\nCash Reduction: $3,000 deducted from Cash Reserves unless financed by a grant.\nAsk:\nHow does this change your financial health?\nWould this make your business stronger in the long run?\nPossible Answer:\nEven though cash is reduced in the short term, this investment will lower electricity costs each month, improving the company’s long-term profitability.\n\nRecap: The balance sheet will change as your assets and liabilities change. If you get an investment or take out a loan, that investment would show up in your assets as cash. Also there will be an increase in owners equity (assuming that the investment was for shares/equity) or there will be an increase in your liabilities if you have to pay that money back. \n\nTransition: Now we will take a look to see exactly how it changes.\n21\n\nSales \nPromotion\nBALANCE SHEET BEFORE A LOAN\nASSETS\nLIABILITIES AND OWNER’S EQUITY\nCash $3,000\nCurrent Liabilities $1,000\nInventory $0\nLoan and Long-term Liabilities $0\nPrepaid Salaries $2,500\nFurniture & Fixtures $8,000\nOwner’s Equity $12,500\nTOTAL ASSETS $13,500\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND OWNER'S EQUITY $13,500\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nSo this is a balance sheet before you take out a loan. Your balance sheet might look like this if you don’t win seed funding or get investment. \nIt looks a little different from the one we made, and it is different from others you will see online, but that is normal. This is a very simple version. Financial models will change slightly based on the business; however, the main components stay the same. You can see that we still have assets, liabilities, and owners equity here (which are the main parts of the balance sheet - What you have vs what you owe)\nAsk: So let’s take a look at this balance sheet. What do you see? What do you know about the business?\nPotential answers:\nThis is the money you put in. Maybe you put in $12,500 of your own. And $1000 from maybe a friend or family member. Although we don’t know exactly the details of where this money came from, we know what it means. \nWith that $13,500 (sum of the debt and ownership), you have been able to buy furniture, prepay some salaries, and keep a few thousand dollars as cash just in case. \n\nRecap: Remember, everything needs to be accounted for. All the money in the business is paying for something (it is balanced)\n\n22\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS\nLIABILITIES AND OWNER’S EQUITY\nCash $3,000\nCurrent Liabilities $1,000\nInventory $40,000\nLoan and Long-term Liabilities $50,000\nPrepaid Salaries $2,500\nFurniture & Fixtures $18,000\nOwner’s Equity $12,500\nTOTAL ASSETS $63,500\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND OWNER'S EQUITY $63,500\nBALANCE SHEET AFTER A LOAN\n20 minutes: Discussion + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nNow let’s assume that you win money, get investment, or take out a loan. You will want to show how that cash injection will change your financials. With new cash, your business can now pay for more things. You will want to show what you are buying, and also where that money came from. Let’s look at an example together:\n\nAsk: Can anyone tell me what happened here (in the picture above)?\nAnswers: \nThis business took out a loan for $50,000. This is shown as a long term loan/liability because it will take over a year to pay it back (if you have to pay it back in less than a year it will be a current liability). \nTotal liabilities and owner’s equity raised to $63,500 because it is the total of the new loan + the original loan of $1000 + the $12,500 that you put in at the beginning (you might need to go back to the previous slide to show exactly how the right side of the balance sheet has changed).\nNow you have to do something with that new money which is shown. If you don’t do anything with the money, it will show up in your assets as cash. This means you have money you can use, but you haven’t spent anything.\nBut according to this balance sheet, the business did spend money. They spent $40,000 on inventory and $10,000 on more furniture and fixtures. \nNo matter how you spend that money, your assets will always equal the total liabilities and owner’s equity (because it will be cash or something else). \n\nRecap: What changed?\nLoans and long term liabilities increased by 50k. It went here because it is a loan you will have to pay back. Not equity. It is also long term because it isn’t meant to be paid back in less than a year. That 50k is a long term liability.\nWhere are you spending this money? You paid for inventory and furniture.\nSomeone looking at this would be interested to see how you spend your money. Is it sitting as cash? 50k as cash doesn’t grow for you. People want to see smart investments with the money. \n\nAnother example:\nAsk: You just saw an example of a loan, but what would it look like if you got investment? How would your balance sheet change?\nAnswers:\nThe amount of investment will be shown in owners equity. It is not a loan and it is not expected to be paid back.\nThe amount of investment would show up as an asset in some form (cash or another asset).\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nThis demonstration might be too complex to go over in class (considering all of the other work they have done so far). As it is not relevant for everyone, consider leaving the conversation high level if the class is having a hard time. You can go over this during advisory sessions for those interested.\nIf they are ready to go into another demonstration show the following points:\nShare your screen and go onto the financial model. Show how the balance sheet changes when you get a loan or investment.\nShow them how an investment would show up on their financial model. \nWhat are you buying: If you are capitalizing anything from this investment, you should show it on your balance sheet as an asset. Balance sheet rows 7-10 show the breakdown of how you are spending that investment.\n\nHow you are paying for the investment: \nIf equity investment: Owners equity on the balance sheet should show the past capital that was invested into the business + the new capital invested in business. The time of the change in owners equity will show the time of the new investment. \nIf loan: Long term debt on the balance sheet will show how much you borrowed and at what time. \nIt will also make a small impact on the P&L (depreciation and amortization will increase to reflect new assets)\n23\n\nON YOUR FINANCIALS\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nNovember\nDecember\nJanuary\nFebruary\nEquity\nCapital\n$63,599\n$63,599\n$93,599\n93,599\nRetained earnings\n-\n-\n8,352\n8,352\nNet Income\n$ 7,400\n$8,352\n$7,235\n6,996\nTotal equity\n$ 70,999\n$71,951\n109,185\n108,946\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY\n$70,999\n$71,951\n109,185\n108,946\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nYou can see a change here in capital from year 1 to year 2 (from 63,599 to 93,599). \nAsk: What might have happened here?\nMore cash went into your business. Maybe you got investment or someone put more money into your business through a grant or something else. \nThis money will show up as cash right away, until you decide to spend the money. Once you spend the money it could be spent on assets\n\n24\n\nUpdate your balance sheet & your business startup costs.\nSend updated financials to a trainer by NEXT Thursday!\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n26]]]",
