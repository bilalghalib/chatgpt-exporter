      "content": "Creating questions that align with the specified levels of competency development requires careful consideration of the threads within the \"Mobilising Others\" competency. Let's structure these questions to ensure they progress from inception and exploration to transformation and innovation. For each level, I will provide three questions along with critiques and complements for each question.\n\n### Competency: Mobilising Others\n\n#### Q Level 1: Inception & Exploration\n1. **Question:** Describe a time when you showed enthusiasm for a new challenge. How did you express this enthusiasm?\n   - **Critique:** This question may elicit only superficial responses about general enthusiasm.\n   - **Complement:** Encourages reflection on personal initiative and motivation.\n\n2. **Question:** Can you recall a situation where you had to communicate an idea clearly to others? How did you ensure your message was understood?\n   - **Critique:** May focus too much on communication skills and not enough on the mobilizing aspect.\n   - **Complement:** Highlights the foundational skill of effective communication.\n\n3. **Question:** Provide an example of how you have been actively involved in creating value for others.\n   - **Critique:** Might be too broad, leading to varied interpretations of 'value.'\n   - **Complement:** Encourages demonstration of proactive engagement in valuable activities.\n\n#### Q Level 2: Experimentation & Action\n1. **Question:** Describe a time when you successfully persuaded others by providing evidence for your arguments. What was the outcome?\n   - **Critique:** Could be too specific to a persuasion style that relies on evidence.\n   - **Complement:** Focuses on the skill of persuasion using logical reasoning.\n\n2. **Question:** Share an instance where you communicated your team's ideas persuasively using different methods.\n   - **Critique:** May not fully capture the individual's ability to mobilize others, focusing more on communication methods.\n   - **Complement:** Demonstrates versatility in communication and team representation.\n\n3. **Question:** How have you overcome resistance to your vision or ideas in a group setting?\n   - **Critique:** Assumes that resistance was present, which may not always be the case.\n   - **Complement:** Explores skills in negotiation and overcoming challenges.\n\n#### Q Level 3: Skill Enhancement\n1. **Question:** Provide an example of how you communicated imaginative design solutions effectively to stakeholders from different backgrounds.\n   - **Critique:** Might be challenging for individuals who haven't worked in diverse environments.\n   - **Complement:** Showcases ability to tailor communication to diverse audiences.\n\n2. **Question:** Describe how you have inspired others, even in challenging circumstances.\n   - **Critique:** Could be difficult to quantify or define 'inspiration.'\n   - **Complement:** Focuses on leadership and motivational skills in adversity.\n\n3. **Question:** How have you maintained momentum with your team, partners, or stakeholders during a challenging situation?\n   - **Critique:** May not directly address the individual's role in mobilizing others.\n   - **Complement:** Highlights skills in sustaining engagement and motivation under pressure.\n\n#### Q Level 4: Collaboration & Complexity\n1. **Question:** Describe a complex problem you solved collaboratively. How did you engage and mobilize others in this process?\n   - **Critique:** Might be too focused on problem-solving, less on the mobilizing aspect.\n   - **Complement:** Emphasizes collaboration and collective action.\n\n2. **Question:** How have you negotiated support for innovative ideas within your organization?\n   - **Critique:** Assumes a specific organizational context and opportunity for negotiation.\n   - **Complement:** Demonstrates skills in securing support for value creation.\n\n3. **Question:** Share an experience where you took a leadership or coordination role in a collaborative project. What was the impact?\n   - **Critique:** Focuses more on leadership than the mobilizing aspect.\n   - **Complement:** Highlights ability to lead and mobilize others towards a common goal.\n\n#### Q Level 5: Transformation & Innovation\n1. **Question:** Describe a project where you led or significantly contributed to transformative innovation. What was the impact?\n   - **Critique:** May be challenging for those who haven't had opportunities for significant innovation.\n   - **Complement:** Encourages showcasing leadership in transformative projects.\n\n2. **Question:** How have you created a call to action that got internal stakeholders, like co-workers or senior managers, on board with an innovative idea?\n   - **Critique:** Specific to internal organizational dynamics.\n   - **Complement:** Demonstrates ability to mobilize and inspire within an organization.\n\n3. **Question:** Provide an example of how you formed a coalition to turn a challenging situation into action.\n   - **Critique:** Assumes access to resources and networks for coalition building.\n   - **Complement:** Showcases strategic thinking and mobilization skills.\n\nThese questions are designed to elicit responses that demonstrate the individual's competency in mobilizing others across various levels of expertise, from foundational to expert.",

How did you maintain your enthusiasm? | Might encourage superficial responses. | Good for assessing resilience and attitude towards challenges. |\n| **Experimentation & Action (Q Level 2)** | 1. How have you used evidence or emotional appeals to persuade others recently? | Might be too broad; specificity in \"recently\" can vary. | Assesses practical application of persuasion skills. |\n| | 2. Detail an instance where you pitched an idea successfully to potential investors or donors. | Very specific, might not apply to all respondents. | Excellent for evaluating specific persuasive and communication skills. |\n| | 3. Describe a situation where you overcame resistance to your vision or innovative approach. | Could be challenging for respondents with limited experience in this area. | Great for understanding problem-solving and innovation. |\n| **Skill Enhancement (Q Level 3)** | 1. Can you provide an example of how you effectively communicated a complex idea to a diverse audience? | Assumes experience with a diverse audience. | Good for evaluating advanced communication skills. |\n| | 2. Provide an example of how you've communicated imaginative design solutions in your field. | Requires specific experience in design thinking. | Encourages sharing of creative problem-solving experiences. |\n| | 3. How have you communicated your or your team's ideas persuasively using different methods? | Broad, might not elicit specific examples. | Allows exploration of diverse communication strategies. |\n| **Collaboration & Complexity (Q Level 4)** | 1. Describe a complex project where your leadership or communication significantly influenced the outcome. | Requires significant professional experience. | Excellent for assessing leadership and impact. |\n| | 2. Explain how you formed and led a coalition to address a complex challenge. | May not be relevant for individuals in non-leadership roles. | Good for understanding strategic thinking and coalition-building. |\n| | 3. Illustrate how you've communicated a vision that persuaded external groups like funders or partner organizations. | Assumes experience with external stakeholder management. | Great for assessing persuasive communication and stakeholder engagement. |\n| **Transformation & Innovation (Q Level 5)** | 1. Share an experience where your vision or communication led to transformative change in an organization or community. | Requires a high level of experience and impact, may not apply to all. | Ideal for assessing visionary leadership and impact. |\n| | 2. Describe a scenario where you inspired and directed a community or stakeholders to act on an opportunity for value creation. | May be too abstract or high-level for some respondents. | Encourages sharing of strategic and transformative experiences. |\n| | 3. Provide an example of how your narratives or scenarios motivated others to take responsibility and act on a new value-creating opportunity. | Could be perceived as too theoretical. | Excellent for understanding storytelling and motivational skills. |\n\nEach question aligns with the principles of good assessment design, though some may be challenging for respondents without extensive experience or specific roles.
