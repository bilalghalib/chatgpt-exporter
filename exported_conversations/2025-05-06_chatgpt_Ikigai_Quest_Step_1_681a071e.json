      "content": "So, my name is Bilal Galib, B-I-L-A-L-G-H-A-L-I-B. I am 39 going on 40, and I have a one-and-a-half-year-old baby named Suleiman and a wife named Josephine, and I live in Lille, France. I grew up in Michigan, born in Illinois, and I was always kind of like a bit of a nerdy kind of kid. I loved nature. I loved learning about rocks and how things work, and trees, and used to look for snakes, and I loved to draw, and I would go to the bookstore regularly, and like, the treat would be when my parents let me buy books. I would read encyclopedias, and I would take them into trees, and really didn't do well in school. I really liked to experiment and play, and I loved tricks. Basically, anything that had a trick to it. So, I learned string games. I loved technology, because it was kind of like a trick. You know, like, I would make any of these, like, learn a paper airplane, learn how to draw, and I would try to learn all of these things. I wanted to, yeah, learn stuff. I don't know why. In any case, that was like me as a kid, but I was always curious and generally pretty smart, so I can get through school without too much studying, but I didn't do well in school, because I would forget to do my homework and all that jazz. In high school, me and my friend looked around, and we were like, wait a second, everybody's studying and working as grocery store clerks. Why don't we do something we love and make money doing it? So, we started a design company, because we loved to draw. And then, while we were doing all these drawings, we started to, you know, get websites, and I started learning to design websites, because I was a big nerd, and I loved computers. This is in, like, 2002. And then, when I graduated, I had all of this, like, design skills, and I pirated software, and I knew I'd do Photoshop and Illustrator. And my cousin asked me, hey, do you know how to make T-shirts? My club at school wants us to make T-shirts. So, I was like, okay, yeah, I can make shirts. And so, I started making T-shirts for my cousin's club using just information I found on the Internet. Did that throughout college, and we used to go to the big music festival. I wanted to sell my own designs, but the thing that actually made a business was making T-shirts for sports teams and other businesses. So, that's kind of how that company went. And then, while I was graduating college, the economic collapse happened in 2008, 2009, and JetBlue had offered an unlimited jetting ticket. And at that point, I had been learning from Instructables, and I had an internship in the office in California, and I met up with people from MIT, and I was like, holy crap, there's other nerds like me that do business and nerdy things and technology. And so, when I graduated college, I had been spending some time at the MIT fraternity that I pledged. I just got in the car, and I drove there. I didn't apply. I really didn't like my school, and so I just left. I talked to the ombudsman, and I convinced my school to let me take classes in the Harvard extension, or anywhere I could take classes to pay and graduate, but barely. So, I was always project-oriented. Anything I learned in school, I wanted to apply. And so, when I finally finished college, I had known about hackerspaces, and I really wanted one in Michigan, where I had grown up. And so, I brought two friends. I convinced them to travel with me for a month, because JetBlue had this unlimited jetting ticket. And so, we traveled to 55 hackerspaces across the country in 2008, 2009, visiting all of these places, trying to figure out what made these places tick. And we discovered they were passion-based learning environments. I called them Pebbles. P-B-L-E. Passion-based learning environment. And so, I started getting interested in education, and then from there, I started thinking about Occupy Wall Street, and the problems of the world, and education, and crypto, and what are these spaces, and what are they doing? And so, I started to start a space in Michigan called All Hands Active with some friends, and a robotics company. We were building autonomous vehicles for the automotive industry, for the factories. And then, the Arab Spring started. And so, I started thinking about, how can I be a part of this youth movement that wants to transform the world by changing the political environment? And so, I thought to myself, okay, why not just practically change the future rather than politically change it? Just change it with our hands. It turned out to be a libertarian. I didn't know that word in those days, but that's what I did. And so, we brought the hackerspace concept to the Middle East, started a non-profit called the Global Entrepreneurship and Makerspace Initiative. But the thing is, while I was doing that, I wound up getting post-traumatic stress, PTSD, because I was going to conflict zones, and I had no training and no support. It was me flying by the seat of my pants, basically having no money, kick-starting some funds, running around the world, seeding the idea of creativity and innovation and community and open source and culture and hackerspaces, and trying to do stuff, but going to places where there were car bombings, and people that helped us co-found spaces were getting blown up, and kids were dying, and it was bad. And I got hurt, but I didn't know about vicarious trauma. I didn't know about any of these things. And so, that project led me to being involved more and more in Lebanon, and I started realizing, after listening to a lot of On Being and trying to do this kind of healing journey on my own, and understanding spirituality and God and what I really believed and how I wanted to be, I found that I wanted to learn and grow and share. And so, in the beginning, I was giving these talks called Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense, to try to work with the hackerspace community to stop 3D printing random trinkets and start doing something meaningful. But I didn't know what meaningful was, and I think I was just angry and reactionary. And then, I gave a talk called Good is Hard, because I started realizing that it's really hard to know what good is. And, you know, everything you do has consequences. And the guy that invented the lobotomy was a real sincere, sweet-hearted man, and the person that invented nitrogen fixing that fed the planet was trying to kill people in war. Fritz Haber and the Haber process. And so, I gave these talks and stopped getting invited to talks, although I love speaking. I don't know if you can tell from my speaking right now. It's one of my skills, and I can just keep going. But, in any case, so after that, I wound up trying to understand Peter Levine, and the body keeps the score, and waking the tiger within, and what is trauma, and what is healing, and what is growth, and what is, you know, after you go and you learn about knowledge and skills, you start thinking about where to apply it to. And so, initially, the idea was to move and to be more community-oriented and live in Lebanon and contribute there. And so, I moved to Lebanon, and I piloted a project for an organization called NAWAYA, which was about teaching refugees design thinking skills. And then, I started a project called Bloom.pm, which is about learning personal and professional development, and trying to bring in soft skills, 21st century skills, reading, and self-knowledge into social enterprises and social enterprise development. And now, that was 2016, now it's 2025. All these years later, I'm realizing that, you know, we need something beyond the personal and professional skills, and we need to understand what is meaningful, what is something that's actually good. How do we define that? How can we align on that? And I'm trying to understand this, and bring that to my work, and I consult for the UN at the International Trade Center in Iraq on post-conflict reconstruction curriculums, and trying to figure out money and life in France and what to do with Bloom that's collapsing.",

You’re a builder of worlds.**  \nYou chased meaning across continents, danced with danger, tried to plant hope in broken soil, and now you’re circling back—not to escape the past, but to metabolize it.

      "content": "okay so what's my current professional situation so I'm consulting with the International Trade Center in Iraq on post-conflict curriculum design so we're working on curriculums that teach people skills to build after ISIS was destroyed half of the old city with 80% of the old city of Mosul was destroyed and so we're trying to find a way of teaching people the skills to build the homes of the future that are going to be more green I studied computer science and mathematics and then ten years later when I decided that I should probably live with my friend my wife in France I studied for my master's degree a degree in learning sciences at the Learning Planet Institute I mostly did it just so I can find a way of doing something else besides following my wife to France but I found that I had good friends and it connects me with people and that's like one benefit of school is like the social network maybe I should just go back to school that's one of the things I'm missing here in Lille more community more networks and there's like a context at school that's really nice current financial situation and goals um so this consulting gig is great it's nice it pays relatively well I think I convinced them you know I'm head of an organization technically I am it's just my organization never paid me so good anyway it was always that I pay the organization more than it pays me almost but they are paying me the highest tier salary a UN consultant can get as a local in Iraq which means that I'm getting the highest salary in Iraq but not where I live which has a different sort of living expense and also it's not guaranteed for a long term and I'm not sure I want to do it long term it's like I'm the person that does their own ideas and creates things and always does something new and whenever it becomes successful sabotages it it's like that's my MO if you will I don't know why but anytime things get successful I get scared that it's gonna be wrong or bad or not according to my values and I fear it and so I think part of me doesn't want things to succeed and so bloom is falling apart mostly I think my co-founder is gonna keep trying I don't really know what my stake is in the company we have a for-profit social enterprise in the UK and a nonprofit based in Lebanon I'm not exactly sure what's gonna happen with this organization I'm supporting but I don't have the brain space for it I'm realizing it's not really that easy I hire a personal assistant who is not so helpful I think sometimes in that she makes some serious like mistakes sometimes but it's just really nice to have somebody that I can talk to that does stuff for me when I'm I'm very good at talking as you can see very bad at like opening up Google Docs and doing stuff so I talked to her a lot and the work quality isn't the best but it doesn't seem like other people notice and so it's okay but it's not what I would prefer like what I'm really doing is I I I'm really trying to figure out some big questions about like ontology epistemology what can we get at in the base layer of our understanding that would help us unify as a civilization that is a human civilization that isn't you know Eastern versus Western or Islamic versus Christian or any of these things it's like is there's I believe there's truth I believe that it's possible to convince people that there is such thing as truth and to get out of this modern like post modern subjectivist worldview and to get get real snap out of the psychedelic trip that we've been in since World War two where everything is nothingness like no just wake up stop it it's not all chaos so that you're gonna create it again with that sort of attitude you know and so my current goals I guess are financially yeah like I need more money I have a small business that I'm using to explore what I call like a beauty based business called no creative studio I sell essential oils and other nature based and crafts products from my travels around the world I have a lot of ideas for it but it basically is like the thing that I fill bottles with oil and ship them and I love I love this little business the money that I make from it feels clean and nice but it's definitely not going to feed the family it basically pays for my assistant who helps me run this business takes maybe a an eighth of my working time and allows her to take off maybe a quarter of my working time for the ITC and then I try to take another you know eighth or quarter for bloom where I go and attend the sessions that my colleagues are running and I try to do stuff with them but then all the rest of my time is I'm spending thinking about these like big philosophical issues and crafting new products and making experiments using AI and using AI a bunch and wondering what is the appropriate place for AI to be in our societies what what does it mean now that AI can create things like what should work be what is our unique perspective as humans if anything and my spiritual exploration around meaning and coming alive and trying to understand what's this next step in the evolution of my thinking from okay let's learn to make stuff and have fun and we got to keep that okay make stuff have fun so I still paint I like my watercolors you know then we got to like make you know be creative and have fun and learn skills and do it together in community and have it lead to like a social enterprise that has some you know entrepreneurship elements and sustainable elements and money but like good money you know and and then after that it's like okay well what about meaning why should we do anything what is like the point of it all you know what is actually good and you know I saw everyone a bunch of people that I was working and growing with and seeing this like Silicon Valley ecosystem go so pro Israel and anti Palestine and people with power and Trump and Elon Musk and like you know like is our goal really to live forever is our goal really to merge with the machines is this really like the best future we can imagine and is the alternative really just to get back to the land and get into these like agricultural sub communities where people have you know reduction in technology use and spending more time grinding their their flour and you know going back to that kind of life is that really the only alternative I don't I don't think so for any of these things but I don't know what it is and I want to be a part of thinking about and creating a space for that with people that are productively thinking about it and so financially I'm not doing so well I mean technically by 40 people should probably own their own house or something but you know I don't like looking at my bank account I just like making sure I can do what I can do but I feel that maybe I'm neglecting things and putting more stress on my wife and some of the bigger issues in my life that relate to finances is if I was rich I could just somehow fly first-class back and forth a bunch to be with my parents and have a nanny that would be able to take care of Sudi as we travel and come with us and trip you know like that would be awesome I would really like to see my parents more there in America I'm here in France that's actually like the biggest core tension in my life is I don't know how to enjoy time with my family and take care of them and to take care of my wife and child at the same time when my parents are in America and I'm here in France and trying to do right by everyone you know and I just feel like I can't and I'm not sure if that's a financial thing or just a decision thing and definitely have ADD and I do a lot of stuff I try to help my dad with his business which is related to like wastewater I wish I could hire maybe a couple of more assistants maybe some higher capacity smart ones and maybe some professional coaches that can help coordinate organize this I know people can run like 20 businesses at the same time so why can't I do this and just contribute like my real skill but I can't really figure out what my real skill is or get the money enough to hire a team to do that all the businesses that I've set up and started I like always don't quote unquote own anything and a part of that might be because of how I like to live but people keep telling me like oh you know you should have taken advantage of that business or this business or you were a part of that and I don't know the only thing I think of in terms of money is like okay you know I'll just buy a little bit of crypto here and there and hope that one day I'll just miraculously get rich or something and be able to live and support people I don't know if that makes any sense but that's what's up",

You know, like, everyone's like, Oh, I'm a creative consultant, or I'm a content creator, or I'm a engineer. Like, I don't actually have those skills. I'm like a hacker, and I'm worried that I'm not a master of anything. And sometimes I think maybe I should become a pastor of something. Take the thing that I'm already close to mastery at, and then just continue until I have mastered something. And then I'd maybe feel more legitimate at taking some money for my work, right? And... Seeing sacred and sustainable, yeah. I'm not actually sure. Like, maybe... Yeah, actually, I think it's important that what I'm doing also feels like it's in service to God, to the world. It's a response to the tensions I feel, an honest response to Palestine and to what's happening in the ecosystem and environment and in the political landscape and discourse. I want to feel like I did something that matters, you know? Not that I got through life, you know? That I was actually trying to answer the questions. I don't know what that would mean for me in terms of where I'm at right now. And also, it's like this... I really feel this tension between coming back to my home and it being quiet and peaceful and nice, and I get to do my prayers and then be by myself. But also, I really like being with people. And I think most people think that I'm really kind of a gregarious and human-oriented and loving and, I don't know, maybe some kind of extrovert. But I'm not sure. I feel like I like it when I'm just by myself. And the chaos of my family when I go back to Michigan is interesting. And the calm that's over here. And then I bring the chaos myself, and I'm like, oh my god, I can't escape the fact that I am chaos. And I sort of like the idea of the mastery and the calm. And I see my cousins and my uncle who is a doctor, and he's translating books on his free time, and he's retiring. And now he's going to spend hours translating every day in his office. And he has a beautiful table and a beautiful library. And it seems like he actually has time for that. And he cooks. And he, you know, like someone that is doing tai chi or aikido or chess. And I'm not chess. I'm not even checkers. I'm just throwing stuff against the wall and seeing what sticks and then being smart enough to be able to explain some random story about the resulting images, you know? Like I just want to feel like I'm okay and I'm good and I'm safe and I'm contributing and I'm doing justice with what I was given and that when I can die happy, you know?",

can click with somebody and give them a gift and then allow myself to like look them in the eye I don't like making eye contact I think I have probably some kind of neurodivergent you know definitely ADD and ADD and some neurodivergence like comes together but like I think about thinking a lot more than I think is normal yeah and so you know like even the ideas of beauty ideas and they just light me up and then but like appreciating it and connecting to it is the other thing and I think this is like some of the next stage elements that I'd really like to do and maybe it's going to connect to actually you know becoming a master or something it's like taking the time being present allowing a thing to be in the uncertainty and to be changed by something and to not be wanting to show expertise too fast because I think that's what the hacks are right it's like look what I can do you know already but you know I've done that thousands of times I have so many projects that I've made that nobody has seen I've written a book called Die Die or Die and it's a kind of novel of three short stories that is just on my google drive and no one has read you know like I haven't even tried publishing it and I think there's something about wanting to be seen not feeling enough reaching out and then not actually connecting and so but the thing that really makes me come alive I think is like doing the right thing when it's hard and then feeling the gift of of that right like if I push myself to go run and I know that I should run and I feel tired but then happy that I did it like I went rock climbing a couple days ago that felt great or if I know I should call my mom and I don't feel like it but I do it and go through the motions and then it feels right but I wind up being able to bring the right sort of energy to it and that feels great and yeah giving my wife a massage and then feeling appreciated but not really letting it happen that's the problem like I know it would make me come to life if there was like just eye contact I'm like I love you and she looks at me I love you that kind of thing I just can't handle it so um oh yeah uh foraging oh my god I love foraging and finding things in the surprise and the classifying and the understanding of like oh this is edible and then cooking something edible from the forest and then sharing it with people is awesome I love it I love the collaborations with nature so sourdough growing mushrooms at home uh these things where it's like oh building a bookshelf uh for my family painting the wall like doing these things especially handmade stuff like I built this bookshelf here and it's not perfect or beautiful but like I built it and it's cool and I like using my hands to bake stuff it's been a long time I think that's something that I'd like to get back into um and yeah writing poems I don't know if it brings me to life but it brings me to presence and that's good too and every once in a while I write something that I remember like I await the day my stone heart breaks wide open and stays that way uh it's a haiku and I I love reading about spiritual traditions and aha moments that I get when I finally understand something and it really clicks deeply and I see the connections between traditions and I can make these bridges and I can see the oneness and the multiplicity is is definitely a highlight for me um definitely I love the playful seriousness you got that right um and spacious conversations like I have those spacious conversations with large language models I don't know if they're spacious like I always try to turn them into questions that I can explore building a product or software or protocol or something I don't like just having these big airy conversations jam sessions I love jam sessions I love improvisation I love like improvisation and then make people making people laugh but I hate or I just can't handle praise you know like that happened at my house one day people came over sort of playing guitar I can get into a flow and I start freestyling and people enjoy it and they laugh and then I'm like I just don't want to be looked at you know I have this weird like push-pull and I don't know if it's real humility or false humility but there's something there um yeah like I think it's it's a small kind of feeling of like wow you know I was a part of setting up an organization that is still around in Michigan and I think it's like one of the things I love is creating context where emergence happens and like goodness is unfolding people meet at a space I created and get married or um you know I was a part of sharing an idea that inspired someone to start a business or who knows you know stuff like that has happened and I just love feeling bigger than I really am right and I'm not that person I didn't I can't take credit for what they're doing but I was a part of their journey and this is part of the reason why I like bloom but there is a bit of weirdness there because I think unless I have the thing that I'm building too that has some validation I think I need more validation than I'm getting um I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing but definitely like validation brings me to life like being seen and recognized but I don't want to be seen or recognized I don't want to be working towards being seen or recognized but I definitely know that it means something for me and I think it's because I want things to be real and true and not just hidden and that's part of the problem right now is like I'm talking with large language models maybe for 10 to 20 hours a week maybe more and I'm discovering things exploring spaces and I'm not sharing with anybody and I must be developing some kind of expertise uh here but what am I doing with it you know I've developed these different kind of models like inspire scriber come alive uh parliaments I built parliaments almost two years ago for the first prototype and didn't share with anybody you know put it on my github and called it a day anyway these are some ideas what can you take from this",

Holding space I guess is the presence thing where I think I'm a pretty good facilitator like I'm good at handling a impromptu space. I also love public speaking. I'm not sure if I'm good at it but I enjoy it and I would love to get better at it. I like and I'm good at prompting. I think there's something about the way that I think that makes it possible for me to come up with interesting prompts to get more out of my own thinking sort of Socratically and I think it helps me at work. I'm good at showing up and figuring things out. I don't know if I'm good at photography. I know I'm like maybe not good at color coordination. My wife doesn't really think I'm very good at that or figuring out what to wear. I'm not good at consistency. I'm not good at follow-through. I'm good at ideation. If you tell me to come up with ten ideas and you give me a topic I can do that. I'm not good at like consistent like stable action on a day-to-day even though I might like it you know in terms of wow finally relaxed. I don't have to worry about like money or job or whatever. I just do X, Y, or Z but I don't think I can do it. I've never tried. I'm good at cooking surprisingly like you know like just take you into a kitchen and I'll figure stuff out. Whatever food there is I can come up with stuff that tastes pretty good. I don't think I'm necessarily really good at small talk. I think that's hard. I don't like doing things that are meaningless but sometimes that means that like dive in too deep. I'm not really good at learning languages. That doesn't seem to be coming too easy for me and I don't really prioritize it. I'm really good at sleeping. I could just fall asleep and I'm not really good at maintaining the habits that keep my mood in a good way like exercise and drinking enough water. I can get really stuck in thoughts and hyper focus. I'm good at weaving a story. I don't know what other skills there are. I guess the thing I'm not even good at like knowing what is a thing in a job you know like what people need to be good at. I'm just good at random figuring it stuff out kind of good and I've never really been involved in other people's organizations. I've never been very humble and joining and you know letting people put me to use and so I feel like it's hard for me to have any idea of what my value add is because it's all only been to organizations that I've set up and none of them have really panned out.",

      "content": "Okay, so where are we here? I'm looking at my top values, sacred curiosity, playful reverence, living the questions. Yeah, understanding is a spiritual act. I think I have some values of like digging deep, making sure that things are true and real and not just wishful thinking, kindness, and staying true to an inspirational moment that felt true and meaningful, even if there's no words for it. So I believe in the Muslim tradition because of a clear witnessing of things in my life and a constant realization of the depth and meaning that happens when I continue to pursue and take one step after the other. And so something about like loving, trusting, verifiable faith or something like that, I don't know exactly how to say this, but there's something about like it's beautiful, it's true, it's real, I commit, I step, there's fear, I try. And it's in a tradition that I'm humble enough to acknowledge is bigger than me and deeper and has proven itself with every step within it that it's solid and meaningful, beautiful, and true. And kind of just knowing that it's my tradition, experiencing the truth of it and having that experience allow me to take another step deeper inside of it. And then at the same time, working to try to make sure it is something I can bring others along the ride with me on, if that makes sense, that it's not just beautiful, meaningful, and true for me, but it's like something I can also engage with others on by having the parallels with other traditions that are parallel, but not mine, right? Like going deep and then finding the analogies and then creating this unity. And yeah, spiritual literacy for post-chaos age, re-weaving meaning into education, healing the culture of extraction, sanctifying creativity, being with the broken. I don't know which one of these really resonates most with me. I think maybe spiritual literacy for a post-chaos age, there's something about creating pathways to healing. It's like the meta architecture that solves these sub-problems by helping people, not by telling them to become Muslims, but by telling them that truth is possible to explore and understand. And we need to be epistemically humble and to find the people that uplift us and to be in these communities and to not fall into meaningless despair and to create and to explore things that bridge and bind us in a shared co-perceived reality that is beautiful and true. And for them to see how I do that through my traditional lens and to maybe be inspired. I do feel that Islam is a interesting middle ground between formless Buddhism and the non-dual perspective and the hyper-individual perspective. The plurality of self, other, and in between subject, object, and transformation is between individual kind of, I think, therefore I am, and there is no I, there is no am, a place in the middle. And I feel like Islam does that for me. And I feel like that's where we can meet each other. And I'm not sure if that clarifies things for you, but I'm also just a very doubtful, skeptical kind of open, curious, evolving person. I don't like to define myself and close doors too quickly in my life. I want to continually be open to reality as it is, and to have that continue to open me up in humility and awareness and awe, but also to recognize that I am limited in my capacity and my ability to perceive and my ability to understand. And that inspiring people who inspire me with their presence and with their being is a big form of education, that there's something that they have that I want, you know? Something here.",

That kind of already represents what I'm doing, except the oil is the only thing that makes money. The rest of the philosophy stuff is just me talking to nobody that is listening because I don't even know how to share and I don't like sharing. A learning guide for this awful age. Maybe not so much that. I don't feel like I'm in a place of convening these days. I used to be more of a host and but maybe I'm older and I have a kid and I just for some reason just don't care about that as much as I used to. Maybe it's a rejection. Maybe it's because I live in France and I don't have the language. Maybe it's because I don't like people somehow. I'm not sure exactly, but I have this rejection to that. Facilitator and residents. Same thing. Retreats. Yeah, big stress. I don't feel like it. Although I'm sure I'd love it once I did it and met people because it's always like that. It's like my friends are the ones that have to force me to go out dancing and when I do I love it, but I really can't get myself to do it. So maybe there's something here to figure out where that tension comes from. Yeah, sacred product designer. So I'm definitely creating products that have meaning in it and I think that's what I'm trying to do with parliaments and I made this like watercolor box and letters in the shape of a hand that is praying and somehow I feel like words might not be enough anymore and I kind of want to make things that are just in the experience of it has what I'm trying to share. Not necessarily in a bunch of words, you know. I've already done a bunch of words a lot. So I'm creating like architecture for conversations or protocol level stuff in terms of chat to have be the thing that is the thing. Hello, how are you? All right, good. A little bit sleepy, but good. I don't know why I couldn't sleep very well. I like woke up to pray and then I because it's just shorter windows, you know, for prayer now. So it's like between yeah like Maghrib to Isha and I'm like okay it's 930 I just want to sleep between Maghrib and then Isha and then I wake up for Isha but so I woke up at like 230 for Isha and they're like okay I gonna have to wake up again for Fajr and anyway so it's like I don't have a good schedule for prayers yet. I'm a little sleepy but good. Yeah I was awake and praying Isha because I fell asleep before praying Isha. Yeah, do you know what time Isha is here? No, 11? 7pm. 7?! Yeah, so we do Maghrib. Maghrib is 6pm and Isha is 7pm. So the difference is only one hour. That's so interesting. It's very different like I haven't been to Indonesia before I don't know what the schedule is like there. Yeah probably but I don't remember what it was like. Okay, let's see. So, do you know why I didn't respond to you about the things you mentioned on voice messages? Because you already did it. No, not because I did it. Because I want to tell you directly. Okay, yeah sure. Okay, do you know what? I have been trying so much to catch up with you. I don't want to blame you because I also have the weakness. And then sometimes I also just carry away with all the stuff that you have. Yeah, it's hard to keep track of right? It's a lot of different things. It's like a lot of things. Yeah, a lot of things I know but sometimes you know I also carry away with all of the stuff. And then sometimes I annoy you so much which just reminds you. But the thing is again we always are trying to find out how the way to catch up everything right? Sometimes okay, we found something and then okay, do you want to continue with it? And then suddenly just hold for a week and then another week it will be different again. You know what I mean? Yeah, that's my problem. This is why I'm like trying to figure out an assistant because I know how I work needs somebody to like put Okay, I feel like I am a fire. Okay, and you know how gasoline you burn gasoline is like a big fire. But if you put gasoline in an engine, it drives the car forward. So I'm a fire and I need an engine right? And the thing is like it's got to be very hard for you because I'm like And you're like, oh, okay. Well, what are we doing now? Yeah, but I have been trying so much with my, you know, my ability I have so far. And then, you know, sometimes I also like, okay, what should I do next again? Oh, what should I can help you out more with his frustration and then everything that make him stressed out. You know, like, because I did the dashboard, you know, not the dashboard. But I did this and then there is also an overview. Yeah. And then I keep reminding you. I also, you know, like throwing what I did, what I have done. And then, you know, like what you can do is see what has actually worked, you know? And then do more of that. Like what works when working with me? Calls. Yeah. I don't know what you were saying this, but like calls work. Yeah, the calls work. So it's good. What else works well? Anything? Yeah. Maybe that's all because sometimes, you know, if I send you a voice message, then sometimes you also don't, you don't even listen yet, right? I listen and then I respond to half of it, but don't respond to the other half, I think. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Do you know what is my, I don't know, I'm quite, I'm quite, I don't know if this is a weakness or not, but this is something annoying to people who I know or people who know me even. Like sometimes, do you remember the worst moment when we had like this communication and then you just like, okay, how do we to make a properly communication or something like that? Because I mostly need like, you know, fully context, like in explicit ways sometimes. Just to avoid misunderstanding, you know, misunderstanding, miscommunication, something like that. I think the calls are good for that because it makes it clear when somebody understands, you know, or not, or if you're in the middle or if you're trying to, because a lot of the times where it's not like we have a routine job, you know, where there's like, we go every day and there's, he's got to take all the calls and tag them and whatever it is. It's like a very creative, evolving, changing, not clear, relational stuff. Yeah, makes it hard to figure out. Even if we had clarity on one thing, it would be like, oh, okay, well, now what do we do from here? Yeah, I think, you know, my schedule and you know, when I have a deliverable, I freak out until the last minute and do a bunch of stuff. So anytime there's no deliverable. Oh, maybe I woke up early to work or something. I don't know. Yeah, I think maybe one baby went to sleep.",

Embodied invitations into meaning.

The figurine has long curly hair pulled back, a beard, and wears a patterned button-up shirt and sandals. The pose is calm, hands mid-gesture, expressive and inviting. Alongside the figure, include 5 miniature accessories in plastic molds: a small bottle of oil, a parchment scroll, a tiny book titled 'Truth?', a compass with swirling lines, and a sculpted spark or flame. The packaging is rendered with soft shadows, uniform lighting, and a clean white background to resemble a professional product photoshoot. The style blends realism with cartoonish 3D stylization, similar to Pixar or modern toy prototypes.\",\n  \"size\": \"1024x1024\"\n}",
