      "content": "The documents you provided contain comprehensive information on water quality challenges and measures in Iraq, particularly relevant to your Environmental Impact Report for the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant in Baghdad.\n\n### Water Quality Challenges in Iraq:\n1. **Sources of Water Resources**: Iraq's water primarily comes from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, underground water, and rainwater. The quantity and quality of these sources are affected by various factors【11†source】.\n   \n2. **Regional and External Factors**: Issues such as the riverheads being located outside Iraq and riparian countries monopolizing water have impacted both the quality and quantity of water reaching Iraq【11†source】.\n\n3. **Quality Deterioration**: Incorrect practices, lack of efficient water treatment systems, and inadequate management of water resources have led to deteriorated water quality. This includes high nitrate concentrations in some areas, high salinity in others, and a general inability of water bodies to absorb pollutants【11†source】.\n\n4. **Climate Change Impacts**: Increased salinity in rivers, low rainfall, and high evaporation rates, exacerbated by climate change, are also significant challenges. The largest percentage of water consumption in Iraq is for agricultural purposes, necessitating efficient irrigation and cultivation methods【11†source】.\n\n### Measures to Improve Water Quality:\n1. **Strategic Objectives and Indicators**: Objectives include increasing the number of operating wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), improving the success rate of water quality indicators for WWTPs, and managing groundwater depletion rates. There's also a focus on rehabilitating water resources in the Marshlands and increasing the number of efficiently operating industrial wastewater treatment plants (IWTPs)【17†source】.\n\n2. **Programs and Projects**: Programs involve cooperation with neighboring countries for water quality and quantity, sharing hydraulic and operational information, studying the impacts of climate change on water demands, and improving water quality. Specific projects include establishing a national database to monitor water quantity and quality, drafting water quality agreements with riparian countries, and developing programs for monitoring and control of different water resources【17†source】.\n\n3. **Marshlands and Wastewater Management**: Plans to reduce water scarcity and deterioration in the Marshlands, including the development of national plans, the use of remote sensing techniques for monitoring and evaluation, and the construction of dams and regulation of water channels. Additionally, there are initiatives for wastewater treatment, including the rehabilitation of WWTPs, using modern technologies like impermeable membrane technology, and establishing programs for monitoring sewage disposal in rivers【17†source】.\n\nThese insights can significantly enhance your report by providing a detailed understanding of the current water quality challenges in Iraq and the strategic measures proposed to address them. Emphasizing these challenges and measures will underscore the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed wastewater treatment technology in your project.",
