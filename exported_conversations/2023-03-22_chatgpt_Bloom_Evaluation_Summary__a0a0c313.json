      "content": "Can you summarize this document and tell me from the point of the bloom organization where we might want to contextualize and add information. It's an audit of performance and we want to look good in front of the funders, I'll give it to you in 3 parts, ready? part 1:         Executive Summary\nThis evaluation aims to assess the program’s implementation and ensure the achievement of the program’s outcomes. Thus, the evaluation provides insights into the program’s impact on the resulting outcomes of the implemented approach and mitigation measures. The evaluation covers the program's entire implementation period. Specifically, AltCity Impact/Bloom’s improvement of best practices following the mid-program evaluation, completed on January 31, 2022. \nAdditionally, the evaluation assesses the Theory of Change and if the fundamental assumptions supporting it are still valid in light of the changing circumstances. \nThis evaluation covers the Youth Entrepreneurship & Employability Accelerators Program (YEEAP), which has three main outcomes:  \nAn effective community of practice (Training Partners and MSMEs) with improved capacities supports MSMEs to operate in complex economic environments\nCapable MSMEs operate successfully in complex economic environments\nAltCity Impact / Bloom.org with strengthened organizational abilities to deliver sustained and growing economic impact for MSMEs in complex environments\nOverall, the AltCity Impact/Bloom successfully met its targets in all the outcomes despite the challenging times and crises the country has been going through in the past two years.\nOur evaluation looked at not only the ToC, methodology, and indicators but also the overall program. It evaluated it at a programmatic and operational level to provide findings and recommendations for future programming.\nA dedicated section is provided at the end with the recommendations for RDPP and AltCity Impact/Bloom to consider and build on for even more effective, efficient, impactful, and sustainable programming in the future.\n\nMethodology  \nBuilding on previous similar projects and per the requirements, the evaluators adopted a participatory mixed methods approach to producing the required deliverables. This includes a desk review and qualitative and quantitative data collection.  We collected input from all stakeholders and analyzed them to generate the necessary findings and recommendations.\nThe evaluation was conducted over four main stages: \n\n\nII.1 Phase One – Desk Review\n\nIn this phase, the team of researchers reviewed the relevant project documents including:\nInitial TOR (to extract the intended goals from the program)\nProject’s Vision and Mission\nProject’s Theory of Change \nProject proposals and narrative reports (prepared during the duration of the project)\nProject’s Logical Framework\nProject’s MEAL Plan and PITT Sheet\nJob Desegregation data\nThe Quarterly Information Note (Start of the Project - Cut off September 30, 2022)\nAC_PWorg YEEA Annual Report 3 (2022-08-20 - shared) - Copy for RPS\nContact lists for the evaluation\n\nFour sets of tools were developed and presented in the following sections to be addressed to 1) enterprises, 2) training partners, 3) mentors, and 4) the team members.\n\nII.2 Phase Two - Data Collection \nThe team, the network members’ input, and the beneficiaries’ were collected via a questionnaire to extract quantifiable indices to measure relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency levels. \nThe data collection method includes two steps: 1. digitization of the questionnaire and the dissemination of the questionnaire link via emails; 2. researchers collected the responses while maintaining the respondents’ anonymity and confidentiality.\n\nSampling strategy: Given that the number of enterprises, training partners, mentors, and team members was attainable, four surveys were distributed to all members to solicit their opinion via the questionnaire. To boost the response rate from the MSMEs and to attain unbiased input. To boost the MSMEs' response rate and to validate the number of jobs created, the RPS team contacted, surveyed, and interviewed the MSMEs via several ways (rounds). Accordingly, 39 MSMEs filled out the survey (on which we built the statistical figures) and 2 joined the discussions, hence a total of 42 MSMEs participated in this evaluation, whereas 7 MSMEs did not (did not fill the survey, nor respond to any of the 3 follow emails, nor answered any of the phone calls, nor participate in the FGD or interviews). Based on the results of the surveys, follow-up interviews were held with each group to explain further the findings.\n\nTable 1 Summary Table of the Groups and the Response Rates\nGroup                 Tool\nSurveys (Response Rate)\nInterviews (Response Rate)\nMSMEs \n39 (80%)\n36 (73%)\nTraining Partners\n5 (83%)\n5 (83%)\nMentors\n4 (22%)\n4 (22%)\nTeam Members\n5 (42%)\n3 (25%)\n\n\n\n\nII.3 Phase Three - Data Cleaning, Findings, and Analysis\nQualitative\nThe RPS Team stored all notes from the interviews on a secured drive. In addition, the notes were reviewed and validated to ensure the quality and accuracy of the information.\nThe team used a content analysis approach and was able to delve into the details and triangulate the results of the survey and desk review.\n\nQuantitative\nThe team provided data from the surveys into standard Microsoft Excel format. Then the team did a round of data cleansing and validation to ensure that the data collected was valid and valuable.\nAccordingly, the team generated the statistical findings and relevant artifacts such as pivots, tables, cross tabs, and charts to present the results appropriately.\nII.4 Phase Four Final Report\nThe findings, analysis, and recommendations resulted from the triangulation of the findings collected via the literature review, and the qualitative and quantitative data. Although some of the interviews were administered in Arabic, this final evaluation report is entirely in English. The information is organized as followed:\nExecutive summary     \nMethodology\nThe Evaluation\nConclusions and recommendations  \nAppendices\nThe Evaluation\nThis assessment is aligned with the OECD evaluation criteria of: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability, and coherence. In the end, the evaluators proceed with the evaluation in that order and conclude it with the lessons learned to pave the way for future planning.\nIII.1 About the MSMEs \nA substantial positive impact was notable on all the participating MSMEs in the Lebanese Growth Accelerator (LGA) implemented by Bloom (an affiliate of AltCity). The MSMEs came from different sectors and backgrounds such as: agro-food, manufacturing, crafts, design, technology, and other sectors. The MSME owners’ age distribution are mainly in their youth or prime age (47% between 18 and 31 years old, 32% between 32 and 45 years old, and the rest above 45 years old). Additionally, there is gender inclusion among the founders of the MSMEs participating in the project, with 49% males and 51% females. \n\nThe MSMEs joined the LGA program via different outreach channels, mainly via the call for MSMEs issued by the Bloom team. Around 47% of the participants in this evaluation indicated joining the program through applying. The other three channels are; 1. a contact person who introduced them to the Bloom team (21%), 2. one of the implementing partners (16%), and 3. some were contacted by the Bloom team (16%).\n\nIII.2 Relevance \nThere is an agreement among the Bloom team members, the mentors, and the participants (MSMEs) that the LGA project aligns with Bloom’s vision and mission from one side and is relevant to the needs of the MSMEs from another. The details relevant to the MSMEs’ perceptions are reported under the decent jobs criteria section. This evaluation shows that the LGA project aligns with Bloom’s vision and mission over three main fronts. First, the LGA project succeeded in enrolling, training, and supporting 49 MSMEs in the program. Second, the LGA project uses the online modality to increase the opportunities for discussion, community exchange, and support. Third, this program succeeded in capacitating the MSMEs, each in the area of their need. This helped them unveil new income opportunities and create at least 564 short-term, part-time, and full-time jobs for refugees and marginalized communities. In total, 514 positions were filled by Lebanese (males and females) and 50 positions by refugees (males and females). The modality of the employment varied from short-term, to part-time, to full-time, depending on the capacity of the MSMEs to retain the new labor. \n\n\n\nThe MSMEs indicated that the LGA program is relevant to their needs regarding the training topics, the supporting material and tools, and the connections with the trainers and coaches. Figure 1, shows on a Likert scale from 1 (minimum relevance) to 5 (maximum relevance), that the perceived reliance level by the MSMEs ranges between 4.44 and 4.53, meaning high relevance level. The areas of improvement are discussed in the effectiveness sections below.  \nJobs Creation Validation: The desk review and interviews with the Bloom team revealed that their validation method for the reported jobs is over two steps. At the end of each program cycle, Bloom program managers share a form with the MSMEs that have completed the cycle to understand the impact of the LGA program on the growth of their enterprises. In addition to the basic identification information asked in the form, they invite the MSMEs to share their enterprises’ growth stage, average monthly revenue, jobs created, position type, gender, age, and employee status. After filling out the form, the Bloom team validates the data at two levels. \nThe Bloom team addresses the possibility of human error by comparing the total value shared by the enterprise for a specific field concerning the disaggregation count of the value. For example, if the enterprise reports ten full-time jobs created but the disaggregation accounts for nine jobs, they would contact the enterprise to clarify. \nSecond, they cross-reference the validated data with the work plan, and budget templates the MSMEs complete during the program implementation to ensure that they meet their targeted employment objectives using the allocated budget. \nFor this evaluation, the RPS team ran another data verification method by contacting each MSME to collect the exact number of jobs created, retained, and unfilled jobs, if any. The validation process confirms the retention of 140 jobs created for the Lebanese and 24 for the Refugees. The retention rate of Lebanese workers is 56%, and that of Syrians is 38%. The following two tables show the number of MSMEs supported by each training partner and the corresponding job retention rate.\n\nTable 2 Distribution of the MSMEs participating in this Evaluation per Partner\nNumber of MSMEs Supported by Each Training Partner \nBloom\n17\n44%\nCentre Mine\n5\n13%\nCewas\n2\n5%\nLAU Innovate\n1\n3%\nMade by Nature\n5\n13%\nmakesense\n2\n5%\nNucleus Ventures\n7\n18%\nTotal\n39\n100%\n\n\nTable 3 Reported hired and retained workers by the Participating MSMEs\nPartner \nLebanese\nSyrians \nBloom\n78\n56%\n12\n50%\nCentre Mine\n21\n15%\n6\n25%\nCewas\n3\n2%\n2\n8%\nLAU Innovate\n0\n0%\n \n \nMade by Nature\n11\n8%\n \n \nmakesense\n7\n5%\n2\n8%\nNucleus Ventures\n20\n14%\n2\n8%\nTotal\n140\n100%\n24\n100%\n\n\nTherefore, the LGA program is vital for the participating MSMEs and many others to survive those crises in Lebanon. It also helps them remain in the market until the economy stabilizes and allows them to grow and develop. Hence, the LGA program is 1) highly needed for the MSMEs in Lebanon and 2) well associated with the overall objective “to enable MSMEs with the support of national partners, and to maintain and create new employment opportunities within the complex economic environment.” \n",
