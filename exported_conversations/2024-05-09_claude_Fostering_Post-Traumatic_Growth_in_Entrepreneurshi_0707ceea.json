It was the year COVID highlighted the importance of\nmental health globally, the year of the Beirut Blast, and when we felt the rumblings of\nglobal financial destabilization. Entrepreneurs find and exploit risk, but what happens\nwhen risk-taking is compounded by a world in flux? What lessons are we learning from\nthe last few years, and how can entrepreneurs and ecosystems adapt? Join me in this\nseries of posts to explore answers to these questions, bridging wellbeing and impact.\nPage 1 of 14\n\nLet's begin by delving into how this evolving landscape has impacted my work and\nperspectives, beginning with a project focused on character strengths.\nFrom Character Strengths to Crisis Response\nIn July 2020, through my non-profit Bloom.pm I was operating a virtual accelerator for\nyouth in Lebanon, supporting education-focused social enterprises with support from\nthe Asfari Foundation. As a graduate student at the University of Paris - Learning\nPlanet Institute, I researched Character Strengths,first described by Positive\nPsychology researchers Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman. I was hoping to\nfind out how these factors related to leading a flourishing life and might be connected\nto entrepreneurial success.\nThen, on August 4, 2020, everything changed. When the Beirut Port Explosion rocked\nthe city, it forced me to think about mental health and wellbeing in a new way.\nThis sudden shift in focus wasn't unique to us; studies conducted in the region revealed\nthat entrepreneurs at large were grappling with similar challenges.\nBuilding Resilience: Lessons from Lebanon and Beyond\nThe tragedy had a profound impact, upending lives and altering the course of many\nentrepreneurial journeys. Faced with a combination of crises—the Beirut blast, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, political revolution, and economic collapse—many who had once\nbeen committed to building their future in Lebanon felt compelled to seek stability\nand security elsewhere.\nThe Konrad Adenaur Stftung researched why people were leaving their businesses\nand moving out of Lebanon. They found that between large and small businesses, 38%\ncan’t cope with the stress of everyday life and are prioritizing their mental health.\nOver 65% are leaving for quality of life and safety abroad.\nPage 2 of 14\n\nKonrad Adenaur Stftung Foundation - Braving the Storm, Safeguarding tThe\nLebanese Economy Page 20\nResearch in Action - Leaving The “Lab”\nThrough the active research I was conducting with my teams, I found that my work on\nwellbeing and flourishing wasn’t an “extra”, it was in fact supporting their\nentrepreneurial efforts. At Bloom, we started hosting sharing circles, online breathwork\ncourses, art therapy, chi gong, and workout classes for entrepreneurs in our programs.\nWe started asking entrepreneurs how they were feeling and began to support each\nother in a new and deeper way. The data was adding up - the entrepreneurs who were\ntaking action towards their holistic wellness in the face of diculties were the ones\nwho persisted with their businesses and were happier too!\nSince the Arab Spring, I’ve been working on building the entrepreneurial capacity of\nthe MENA entrepreneurship ecosystem. Starting with technical skills through my work\non maker/hackerspaces and today through my work with Bloom and our\npersonal/professional growth accelerators. As ecosystem builders, we must address\nentrepreneurs' need - perhaps more than others - for wellbeing support. And we're not\nalone in recognizing the significance of this issue; recent research has brought the\nmental health crisis among MENA entrepreneurs into sharp focus.\nPage 3 of 14\n\nRecent studies make this clear, including 2021 research by Wamda, Microsoft for\nStartups, EMPWR, and H.A.D Consultants, which sheds light specifically on the mental\nhealth challenges facing entrepreneurs in the MENA region. That research exposed\nthat, along with economic uncertainty and social upheaval, almost 36% of founders\ndescribed their mental health as 'bad.' Additionally, while 44.2% spend at least two\nhours a week decompressing, less than 10% feel their mental state is in a good place.\nThe survey drew heavily from the region's wealthier, more stable nations, with over\n50% of respondents from the UAE alone. KSA and Jordan together comprised another\n22%. Perspectives from less prosperous MENA countries were limited in the dataset.\nTake Action: Join The Wellbeing Survey and Learning Conference\nLet’s build a healthier, more impactful ecosystem together! I invite you to join our\naction-oriented research by taking the Wellbeing at Work Survey.\nWith your input, we can begin to “diagnose” where our ecosystem is struggling with\nwellbeing so that we can find the medicine we need. What might we do to help our\norganizations, governments, and companies bring more wellness to individuals, teams,\norganizations, and communities?\nWe are hosting an in-person Wellbeing for Impact Learning Conference in Lebanon\non Sept 29. We’d love to see you there to discover the survey's preliminary results, and\nexperience workshops and sessions highlighted by a growing body of research\ndemonstrating that taking care of ourselves is good for business.\nPage 4 of 14\n\nIn 2021, Wamda, in collaboration with Microsoft for Startups, EMPWR and H.A.D\nConsultants conducted a study assessing the impact of COVID on the\nentrepreneurship ecosystem mainly in the UAE. They found that the MENA region is a\nhotspot for multiple challenges, including economic downturns and political unrest.\nAmidst this, research by psychologists Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence Calhoun shows\nthat it's possible for both individuals and organizations to experience post-traumatic\ngrowth. At Bloom, we're focused on leveraging this potential to create resilient\necosystems.\nSuggested addition: I'm one of the co-founders of Bloom.pm, an accelerator that operates out\nof Lebanon regionally through its virtual entrepreneurship programs. In the last years, since\nthe economic collapse, the revolution and protests, the Beirut blast and the devaluation of the\ncurrency, we have seen many people leaving Lebanon to find their fortunes elsewhere. What I\nwonder is: do they have to?\nPage 5 of 14\n\nCultivating Growth with Bloom: A Hands-On Approach\nSuggested addition: Many organizations and businesses and governments would prefer to\ncontinue to operate in Lebanon, in Morocco, in Tunis, in all of these places. And especially for\nme, importantly, I am originally from Iraq, and my parents wanted me to grow up in Iraq, but\nthey couldn't because of the wars. And so ever since I was young, I always wondered, is it\npossible to build in these regions? Some research by ArabNet and the Conrad Stiftung\nFoundation has indicated that many people have left Lebanon and left their businesses, and\na big reason is they're unable to cope with the stress of everyday life and prioritize their\nmental health. They're also moving abroad in search of quality of life and safety and security.\nAll of these things are big components of well-being and decent work.\nJoin the Movement: Participate in Our Well-being at Work Survey\nAt Bloom we are working on a wellbeing at work survey to help us understand the\nwellbeing gaps in the entrepreneurship ecosystem in the Middle East and to then\nsupport the training organizations with resources and tools to help their teams\naddress those needs. Imagine someone aspiring to cross a river.\nImagine you’re trying to swim across a river and you don’t know how to swim. You can\neither jump and start splashing…. Or you can get a better perspective, understand the\nterrain, learn to swim and then flow. This metaphor embodies our approach at Bloom,\nnurturing environments where individuals and organizations can navigate the\nchallenges of our times with grace and ecacy.\nPage 6 of 14\n\nYour participation will help shape strategies and interventions that foster\npost-traumatic growth in our workplaces, creating environments where individuals,\nbusinesses, and communities flourish synergistically.\nWe invite you to be a part of this survey. Your insights will help chart a path of growth\nand resilience and inspire a future where wellness and success coexist harmoniously in\nour work environments. [Insert link to the survey here]\nConclusion: Building a Future Where People and Planet Thrive\nPage 7 of 14\n\nAs we forge ahead in these tumultuous times, the experiences from regions like\nLebanon serve as reminders: mental health diculties are an inevitable facet of our\njourney, especially for entrepreneurs.\nRecently, the MENA region has served as a crucible, demonstrating the raw and often\nuntapped potential of post-traumatic growth. This concept, illuminated by researchers\nRichard Tedeschi, PhD, and Lawrence Calhoun, PhD, revolutionizes our understanding\nof resilience, emphasizing that true growth often blossoms from the ashes of trauma.\nAt Bloom, we are embarking on a mission to facilitate this growth, fostering\nenvironments where individuals and organizations don't just bounce back but leap\nforward, fully equipped to navigate the intricacies of an ever-changing world.\nThe Expatodus: Unravelling the Underlying Triggers\nBefore we forge ahead, it is vital to understand the depth of the existing crisis in\nareas like Lebanon, where a significant fraction of the workforce seeks refuge and\nopportunities abroad. Recent data uncovers alarming trends:\n● About 66% prioritize moving abroad for a better quality of life\n● Around 68% are seeking security and safety overseas\n● 55% are drawn by superior financial opportunities abroad\n● 38% find it imperative to prioritize their mental health, unable to cope with\ndaily stresses in the region\nUnderstanding these nuances is critical as we devise strategies to foster\npost-traumatic growth, creating ecosystems that retain talent and nurture it to its\nfullest potential.\nBeyond Resilience: The Path of Post-Traumatic Growth\nGeorge Bonanno's seminal research on resilience reveals a profound insight: resilience\nis commonplace. A minority navigate the pathways of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD), but a golden segment experiences post-traumatic growth. This growth\nsignifies an elevation, a flourishing that comes with having navigated the complexity\nof trauma.\nBonanno advocates for identifying and bolstering the factors that propel individuals\ntowards this growth trajectory, moving beyond theoretical constructs to practical,\nreal-world applications. This approach aims to foster what is often termed as\n\"antifragility\", presenting a tangible pathway to thriving amidst adversity.\nOriginal Audio:\nPage 8 of 14\n\nIn 2020, I was running an entrepreneurship training program for social enterprises in Lebanon\nworking in education with support from the Asfari Foundation. I was taking the\nEntrepreneurship Character Strengths Assessment from the School of Positive Psychology, the\nValues in Action Characters profile, to see if I could figure out the correlates for\nentrepreneurship in character traits to understand which ways of being led to persistent and\nsuccessful entrepreneurs. Yet in the middle of this experiment, in the middle of this training,\nthere was the Beirut terrible explosion that destroyed much of the city and shattered the\ndreams of many of the entrepreneurs in my program. While initially my research was\nattempting to identify the qualities, the ways of being that bring us to life, that bring us a\nsense of fulfillment and flourishing, and support us as well in creating healthy entrepreneurial\nprojects, I suddenly found myself also confronted with the reality of trauma. And I thought\nthat it would be potentially of service to the entrepreneurs in my program, the entrepreneurs\nthat I work with in Lebanon and Iraq and the Middle East and North Africa and in all the\nplaces in the world that are experiencing great change and also sometimes trauma as we just\nsaw in Morocco and in Libya. And as we know, none of us are exempt and in our fast\nchanging futures, who knows when we will be confronted with diculty. So the question came,\nis it possible to identify the qualities that support people growing through the diculty? And\nit turns out that in the scientific literature, there is a factor less known than post-traumatic\nstress disorder called post-traumatic growth. And I began exploring the factors that relate to\npost-traumatic growth and how to bring them into the entrepreneurship programs I'm working\non.\nAnd so after that experience and understanding that there are factors that are correlated\nwith growth after a trauma, in today's trauma-informed culture it seems like every day there's\na news article talking about resilience, trauma, and the importance of having a\ntrauma-informed environment. The fact is most people are actually resilient. It is the norm. If\nyou check out Bonanno's work you will see that resilience is what happens in the middle of the\nbell curve. There is a small minority that wind up having diculties and that's what we call\npost-traumatic stress disorder, people that have long-term negative repercussions, and then\nthere are another small minority that have long-term positive growth outcomes from the\nexperience of diculty. My question was can we begin to identify those factors and then can\nwe create environments in our entrepreneurship ecosystem, in the entrepreneurial training\nprograms, in our workplaces, in our organizations, in our schools to help us prepare for when\nthe inevitable is bound to happen. We in the past had different support networks around us.\nAs someone who currently works from home and lives far from family and from my dearest\nfriends, I know that my work environment is a big part of my social and and emotional\nstability. How can we create workplaces that both promote goodness for the individual while\nsimultaneously creating positive business outcomes and especially for social entrepreneurs\npositive environmental and social impact without burning out the people in our organizations?\nThe research is clear. The data is coming back over and over and over again from the Gallup\npolls about disengaged workers costing trillions of dollars to the global economy that the time\nis now to take care of ourselves so that we can take care of our businesses and communities\nand create the change that we want to see in the world.\nI'm one of the co-founders of Bloom.pm, an accelerator that operates out of Lebanon\nregionally through its virtual entrepreneurship programs. And we have seen in the last years,\nsince the economic collapse, since the revolution and protests, since the Beirut blast, since the\ndevaluation of the currency, many people leaving Lebanon to find their fortunes elsewhere.\nPage 9 of 14\n\nThe question is, do they have to? Many organizations and businesses and governments would\nprefer to continue to operate in Lebanon, in Morocco, in Tunis, in all of these places. And\nespecially for me, importantly, I am originally from Iraq, and my parents wanted me to grow\nup in Iraq, but they couldn't because of the wars. And so ever since I was young, I always\nwondered, is it possible to build in these regions? Some research by ArabNet and the Conrad\nStiftung Foundation has indicated that many people have left Lebanon and left their\nbusinesses, and a big reason is they're unable to cope with the stress of everyday life and\nprioritize their mental health. They're also moving abroad in search of quality of life and\nsafety and security. All of these things are big components of well-being and decent work. This\nis why we are conducting a well-being at work survey, where we would like to identify what it's\nlike in the ecosystem today. What might we be able to do to help our organizations, our\ngovernments, and us as individuals within our companies to bring more wellness to us\nindividually, to our teams, to our organizations, and to our communities? Some things we\ncannot change: we cannot prevent a tsunami or a natural disaster. But we can change how we\ntalk to each other about it. In my research, it shows that that is actually a bigger determinant\nof whether or not the diculties help us grow or collapse.\nSo back in 2020, immediately after the blast, I was unable to pull myself away from my\ncomputer, trying my best to coordinate rescue efforts, data collection, supporting non-stop,\nuntil my friend took my laptop away from me, took my phone away from me, and forced me\nto take a break. It wasn't until then that I realized that I had been overstressing, that I hadn't\nbeen sleeping or eating, and that I had been increasingly more effective, more and more\nineffective, and less effective over time. And that there's a difference between exerting energy\nand making progress. Sometimes I like to give the example of someone in the water who\ndoesn't know how to swim splashing and making a mess, versus someone who has taken\nlessons and uses far less energy but is making it to the other side of the shore. And that is\nwhat I would like to bring to our entrepreneurship ecosystem. With this survey, identifying how\nto bring positive change, starting with the individual, moving to the relational, and then out\ninto the organizational. How can we bring practices that will help us enhance the strength and\nresiliency of our ecosystem and increase the likelihood that when something happens, we'll be\nprepared?\nIn my research on post-traumatic growth and the factors, I found that two really important\nfactors are:\nFirst, people have a strong social network. That means that our oces cannot be places where\nwe don't trust our colleagues, where we are having back-oce gossip, where we don't\nunderstand the intentions of our leadership. We need to create an environment of deep and\nmeaningful relationships at work. This will be the first place that will create a buffer between\nwhatever is happening and how we feel about it.\nSecondly, learning internal conversational skills called deliberate rumination. Intrusive\nrumination is complaining about what is happening and saying, why is this happening to me?\nDeliberate rumination is asking, accepting what is happening, what can I do about this\nsituation? And talking to each other about it.\nPage 10 of 14\n\nEntrepreneurship Amidst Adversity\nIn 2020, I led a training program for people starting businesses in Lebanon. We focused on\neducation and got help from the Asfari Foundation. I took a test from the School of Positive\nPsychology to learn about character traits that make good entrepreneurs.\nBut then, there was a big explosion in Beirut. It hurt the city and many people's dreams. My\nwork changed because now we also had to deal with trauma.\nI wondered if there were qualities that could help people grow through hard times. I found out\nabout something called post-traumatic growth, which is not as well-known as post-traumatic\nstress disorder.\nNow, my goal is to explore how these factors can be part of our entrepreneurship programs\naround the world where challenges are faced by everyone at some point or another during\ntheir journey towards success..\nResilience in Work and Life\nAfter learning that some people grow after going through hard times, we often hear about\nthe importance of being strong in tough situations. Most people are actually good at handling\nproblems. Only a few have long-lasting troubles and others become better because of them.\nCan we find out what helps us handle diculties? And can we make our schools, workplaces,\nand other places ready for when bad things happen? In the past, we had more support from\nfamily and friends around us. But now many of us work far away from them or even from\nhome.\nHow do we make workplaces that help each person while also helping the business succeed?\nThis is important for businesses that want to create a positive impact on society without\nmaking their workers feel too tired or stressed.\nThe research shows it's time to take care of ourselves so that we can take care of our\nbusinesses and communities. By doing this, we can create the change that will make the world\na better place.\nBloom.pm: Rebuilding Businesses Locally\nPage 11 of 14\n\nI am a co-founder of Bloom.pm, an accelerator that helps people start businesses in Lebanon\nand nearby areas. In recent years, many people have left Lebanon because of problems like\nthe economy, protests, and the Beirut blast. They are looking for a better life somewhere else.\nBut do they really need to leave? Many groups want to keep working in places like Lebanon,\nMorocco, and Tunis. I come from Iraq myself but had to move away when I was young because\nof wars. Since then, I've wondered if it's possible to build something good in these regions.\nResearch shows that many people leave their homes and businesses due to stress and not\nfeeling safe or happy where they live.

The more teams feel resourced to face the challenges of life and work,\neven in chaotic times, the better the outcomes for the teams and their social initiatives.\nBloom's research team conducted qualitative and quantitative research to\ncontextualize the changes seen within the Character Strengths of our participants.\nReviewing the data in the context of the challenges that people in Lebanon have faced\nover the last year, we raised the question: How may our programs impact the people\nwho were part of our programs?\nWe are interviewing participants who went through the complete 6-month (planned\ninitially as four months) Accelerator Program (May to October 2020) and those who only\nwent through the two-week Sprint Program (in April 2020) to deepen the\nunderstanding of how people respond to and grow through challenging situations and\nhow those responses differ within a program and outside a program. We are doing this\nto identify better the factors that lead to post-traumatic growth (PTG is defined below)\nand then to include these factors more deeply in our programming.\nThis report describes a recently identified buffering effect for participants within the\nACSI program on the measure of Character Strengths overall and a more substantial\nbuffering effect on Well-being and Life Satisfaction factors.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPost-Traumatic Stress vs Post-Traumatic Growth 3\nEvidence from the ACSI Program 4\nQuantitative Evidence 4\nQuantitative Evidence 7\nPractical Program Applications of Our Hypotheses 9\nFurther Exploration 9\nReferences 11\nPage 2 of 11\n\nPost-Traumatic Stress vs Post-Traumatic Growth\nTrauma and the accompanying stressors that persist do impact many people who go\nthrough an acute traumatic event, such as the blast that went off in Beirut last year, or\nsustained challenges, such as those emerging from the pandemic, economic collapse,\nand others. Individuals may have trouble concentrating, flashbacks, sensitivity to similar\nsituations, and other negative experiences that develop after a traumatic event are\ncalled Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The research shows that after a traumatic\nevent, there are three primary responses:\n1. A small percentage of people who experience it develop PTSD,\n2. The majority of people show resilience and return to the pre-event state,\n3. Another minority demonstrates something called Post Traumatic Growth.\n(Jeon 2015)\nIn Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG), after a traumatic event spent grappling with the\nchallenges, there is a period of growth whereby people develop new strengths, see new\npossibilities, grow spiritually, develop closer relationships, and have a deeper\nappreciation for life.\nThese days, more programs are becoming trauma-informed and adapting accordingly,\nbut there is little inclusion in entrepreneurship programs and little research focusing on\nhow entrepreneurship programs can better support communities during and after\ntraumatic events and post-traumatic growth. In an age of disruption and “new\nnormals,” understanding what supports PTG is critical.\nPage 3 of 11\n\nEvidence from the ACSI Program\nTo explore this further in the context of our programs, we have recently analyzed the\nCharacter Strengths profiles of people who went through our ACSI Sprint+Accelerator\nprogram versus those who just went through the ACSI Sprint Program.\nFor this cohort of participants, we have primary quantitative data collected at the\nbeginning of the Sprint period (April 2020). We then selected a subset of teams for the\nlonger 4-month Accelerator program, which we extended to six months due to the\nchallenges in Lebanon and beyond.\nIt is important to note that these are small-scale studies with 13 participants within our\naccelerator program and 17 participants within the Sprint-only program.\nQuantitative Evidence\nWe conducted the same quantitative assessment from December 2020 to January\n2021, with the initial results shared here.\nFrom an aggregated view, the ACSI program seemed to prevent a drop in overall\ncharacter strengths. We collected samples of the ACSI Sprinters' character strengths\nprofile at the beginning of the program during the sprint period. We re-assessed\npeople who participated only in the Sprint and participants who completed the ACSI\nAccelerator program.\nBy comparing the pre/post changes across all 24 Character Strengths, we see that the\nACSI teams that were part of the Accelerator program had a slight .2 point increase in\nPage 4 of 11\n\ntheir aggregated scores compared to the teams not part of the Accelerator program,\nwhich experienced a .6 point drop.\nThis exploration led to identifying that the impact of our program had a more\nsubstantial buffering effect on the facets that supported Life-Satisfaction and\nWell-being, mainly Humor, Zest, and Gratitude :\n1\nTrait\nCorrelation w/\nWell-being\nCorrelation w/\nLife Satisfaction\nChange / Accelerator\nFor Accel Teams\nChange / Accelerator\nFor Non-Accel Teams\nBuffering\neffect\nHope \nr = .30 r = .53 -0.04 -1.43 1.39\nLove \nr = .18 r = .35 -0.27 -1.84 1.57\nHumor \nr = .25 r = .26 1.12 -0.55 1.67\nCuriosity \nr = .25 r = .39 0.96 -0.52 1.48\nZest \nr = .34 r = .52 0.35 -0.77 1.11\nGratitude \nr = .21 r = .43 -0.15 -0.73 0.58\nAverage \nr = .26 r = .41 0.12 -0.58 1.25\nIt is interesting to note the development of Humor within our programs, which has\nbeen linked to adaptive coping and keeping a light attitude in the face of adversity\n(Ruch & Hofmann, 2017).\n1 \nData on Well-being from Gander, F., Hofmann (2019)\nData on Life Satisfaction from Park, N., Peterson, C., & Seligman, M.

The interviewees were divided into ten people from\noutside the training program and 11 who had gone through the training program.\nAfter the Beirut Explosion, many of the interviewees were feeling angry. Although\nanger may be seen as a negative state, many participants used their anger towards a\nfactor we called Revolutionary Ideation.\n“Angry at the government, of course. Angry that the city I love was destroyed.\nThe nice things about our city were destroyed in a second because of the\nirresponsibility of the people governing. Of course, I went to the protest that\nhappened immediately after” - Interview 006\nSome people went to the streets to protest, while others viewed their entrepreneurial\nactivity as their “action” in response:\n“With the revolution came many different revolutions... one of the revolutions we\nare making is in education. And I say that I am an activist and not on the\nground - it is our revolution in education. I do not think the revolution is only\nabout going down and doing it violently. It is about rethinking, unlearning,\nrecreating. Putting aside everything traditional / forced upon us / trying to make\na difference. not just to make money. Money is not the aim, it is the reward. It is\nnot the reward I am aiming for. The impact is the aim I want. There have been\nlots of revolutions in media, education, and feminism/sexuality. This awareness\nis coming out and has been a social revolution, not only (taboo). Not just a gov\n/political revolution; it is everything. This is my revolution.”\n-Interview 019\nResilience inspires action and engagement as an antidote to the potential freezing\nreflex. While focusing on character strengths development has been shown to support\nwell-being factors described by PERMA (Goodman & Kauffman, 2017), a subset stands\nout in our interviews. The components of this subset are hope, humor, self-regulation,\nsocial intelligence, and teamwork. We can see that these are especially correlated with\nresilience and may be interesting to explore in future studies.\nPage 7 of 11\n\nTraumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since they can shatter mental\nmodels, self-image, and worldviews, and while the possibility of rebuilding these offers\na potential avenue for change and positive growth for the individual given the right\ncontext, environment, and support (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how\npeople choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous section, we described\npeople who engage (flight). This time, let us discuss migration (flight).\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic\nhappens. Before the blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge. World Bank data\nindicates that about 40 percent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates\nleave Lebanon upon graduation (World Bank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what\nthe migration impact of the explosion will be, the total population of Lebanon dropped\nby .44% last year, and (Ibrahim, 2020) reports that the number of people leaving\nLebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the blast. Understanding the\ndecision-making process of social entrepreneurs is critical since they are an important\npart of the population working on creating stability and positive reasons for people to\nstay, either through their services, as employees, or as customers.\nThis snippet of dialogue from an interview demonstrates the importance of holding\nmultiple perspectives in real time and ends with a contradiction: a desire to want to\nstay.\n“For instance, if I had kids. If I was in Beirut/ lost a close family member, I may\nhave thought I would leave. Fortunately, I do not; it relates to how much they\ncan take. My brother is leaving for France in September, so I cannot leave\neveryone/my family. We have a family business, and my father is relatively old.\nAnd I want to stay here willingly.”\n-004 Interview\nThe third response individuals have in the face of an overwhelmingly negative situation\nis to freeze. In our interviews, we identified the initial stages after the blast, where many\npeople felt stuck, expressing exasperation and frustration at the situation, indicating\nthey sensed a loss of control. These aspects connect to Posttraumatic Growth (PTG) by\nnegating the opposite, posttraumatic stress. Some of the symptoms of PTS are freezing,\nfeeling numbness, an inability to act or care, holding one’s breath, and a sense of\ndread…\nWhile it is important not to overstate the case of PTS, most people respond quite\nresiliently, as proposed by (Bonanno et al., 2004). Also, for people to experience the\npositive effects of PTG, even the challenges and stressors of ordinary life can be enough\nof a trigger to stimulate benefits (Ewert et al.; S., 2019).\n“... It is useless. They are not serving us by doing this. (Sharing news about the\nsituation) They are producing anger that cannot turn into anything. The people\nare already angry about the economic issue. They do not have proof. One can\nsit and do theories for hours.”\n017 Interview\n“Khalas (an exasperated form of “enough” in Arabic). I cannot control anything…\nI need to control my feelings and thoughts.\nPage 8 of 11\n\n-020 Interview\nPractical Program Applications of Our Hypotheses\nA key objective of our programmatic approach in Bloom is to combine these critical\naspects of character and universal skills development into our entrepreneurial support\nprograms since the success of social impact and traditional enterprises is intimately\nconnected to the team's capacities, especially founding and early team, of an\nenterprise. The more effective programs can be in terms of enterprise and personal\ndevelopment factors, the more impactful the programs can be in the short- and\nlong-term. This is even more critical in emerging ecosystems and\nmarginalized/vulnerable communities where character and skill development\nopportunities are less available and where exposure to acute and sustained traumatic\nexperiences is more common.\nFurther Exploration\nFurther exploration will tackle how to deepen the factors supporting these traits and\nengender post-traumatic growth in an age of instability and chaos. Social Support and\nDeliberate Rumination correlate with increased potential for Post Traumatic Growth\n(Morris et al.; J., 2011).\n(Morris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J. 2011).\nThe programmatic implications of the factor analysis above and the strengths\nassessment open lines of inquiry about the potential benefit of a conscious discussion\nof strengths.\nPage 9 of 11\n\nDeliberate Ruminating is the process of choosing the questions and thoughts one has\naround a traumatic event, such as “What is the lesson I am learning through this?” This\nis in contrast with Intrusive Ruminating and Brooding, which may take the tone of\n“Why is this always happening to me?”\nIncluding moments of Deliberate Rumination in a social setting where trust is first\nestablished can potentially support PTG. Including a focus on Strengths that support\nindividuals' sense of life satisfaction and overall well-being is hypothesized to set a state\nof mind conducive to positive Deliberate Rumination.\nA traumatic event is destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models,\nself-image, and worldviews. The possibility of rebuilding these offers a potential avenue\nfor change and positive growth for the individual given the proper context,\nenvironment, and support (Roepke et al., M. E. P. 2014). Throughout one’s life, the\nmajority (> 60% across many countries) of people will experience an event that they\nreport as traumatic (Scott et al., 2013).\nThe chart above shows that traumatic events offer individuals transformational\npotential. Bloom believes that Social Entrepreneurship programs can provide the\nscaffolding to support the development of PTG, personal growth, and positive societal\nimpact.\nBy engaging individuals with New Possibilities (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman) through\ntheir enterprises, offering positive social support, facilitating moments of collective\npositive rumination, and making visible and encouraging growth of the Character\nStrengths that promote life satisfaction and well-being.\nPrograms that consider this are hypothesized to support individuals going through\ntrauma and create framing that helps guide them toward becoming personal\ntransformational experiences that lead to societal transformational experiences.\nPage 10 of 11\n\nThank you for the opportunity to deepen our understanding of character strengths\nthrough the ACSI program. We welcome further discussion on sharing knowledge and\ndata on trauma-informed social entrepreneurship programming across all Asfari\nprograms.\nReferences\nMorris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J.

Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nincrease stability. In these countries, the entrepreneurial landscape is non-ideal due\nto the additional challenges within the political and economic landscape. Potential\nviolence and social unrest entrepreneurs must deal with plus the usual stress and\nchallenges of operating an enterprise. The additional stressors of an entrepreneur\nworking in a conflict-prone area on top of the challenges of capitalising and\noperating in conditions of uncertainty shine a light on the need to understand\nemotion, affect, character strengths and resilience alongside more traditional\neconomic and entrepreneurial measures.\nThe insights gained from the edge cases of entrepreneurship education will bear\nfruit for educators, policymakers, and multinational NGOs who seek a sustainable\ndevelopment path. Challenges and stressors confront anyone wanting to create\nchange and identifying cross-culturally relevant interventions to nurture resilience\nand support entrepreneurial orientation, action, and success will be beneficial.\n2/ Presentation of references\nTo clarify the challenges and opportunities presented to governments, universities\nand other entrepreneurial ecosystem facilitators this review goes over a subset of the\nliterature discussing:\n● \nEntrepreneurial Intent (Zhao, Seibert, & Hills, 2005),\n● \nEntrepreneurial Orientation and Intent\n● \nEntrepreneurial Cognition and Action\nAnd viewing them in relation to:\n● \nSelf-efficacy (Benight & Bandura, 2004)\n● \nResilience / Post Traumatic Growth\n● \nEmotion / Affect - as mood and passions (Baron 2008)\n● \nAnd hope - defined as a cognitive capability in as opposed to an emotion\n(Arend 2020).\nWithin this literature review, the following relevant questions were salient in regards\nto identifying the factors relating to entrepreneurial intent and action in conflicted\nareas:\n1. \nWhat mediates entrepreneurial self-efficacy?\n2. \nHow do conflict and trauma promote or demote the factors leading to\nentrepreneurial motivation and action?\n3. \nWhat interventions enhance the promoting factors and inhibit the demoting\nfactors leading to entrepreneurial motivation and action?\nConcepts\n\nM2 Lesc 20-21 - U.E. Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nWithin question 1, we identified the concepts of positive affect (Bernoster et al. -\n2020), and metacognition as factors that support entrepreneurial self-efficacy.\nWithin question 2, we identified the concepts of Post-Traumatic\nGrowth(Shakespeare-Finch 2011), Brooding VS Rumination (Garcia 2014), and Hope\n(as cognitive capability VS emotion).\nConceptual Map Example: Positive Affect mediates between Self Efficacy and Innovative\nBehaviors.\nWithin question 3 we identified the concepts of Signature Strengths training within\nthe Values in Action Character Strengths model (Schutte and Malouff - 2019),\nReappraisals and positive reinterpretation (Scheier, Weintraub, & Carver, 1986),\nDeliberate Rumination, Benefit Finding (Ai et al. 2005), and Social Support.\nThe surveyed papers demonstrate a lack of specificity between positive affect, life\nsatisfaction, and happiness (Schutte 2019).\nResults\nIt is clear that affect matters. The literature reviewed demonstrates that positive\naffect mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and the innovative behavior of\nentrepreneurs. (Mielniczuk 2020) which aligns with (Bandura, 1997)’s explanation of\nhow self-efficacy enhances wellbeing and outcomes.\n(Uy et al. 2017) demonstrated that higher Affect Spin (the dynamics of changing\nmood/feelings) impedes progress on entrepreneurial milestones. The impact\nremains, regardless of the type of affect Spin - either entirely within the positive\nrange or ranging from positive to negative. Affect stability is related to wellbeing and\nwellbeing pertaining to goal orientation and goal orientation to supporting venture\nprogress.\n\nM2 Lesc 20-21 - U.E. Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nWhat inhibits progress for entrepreneurs in conflict and challenged areas? Across\nstudies, we find that intrusive rumination and brooding stemming from a traumatic\nevent mediate the relationship between subjective and post-traumatic symptoms\n(García 2015). The monitoring that comes from a metacognitive perspective can be\nrelated to intrusive rumination. In (Learning 2015) we see that metacognition is the\nmediating factor between Social Support and Wellbeing.\nThe previous results demonstrate the correlates of affect and internal narrative to\nentrepreneurial behaviors and intention. Metacognition also plays a vital role as a\nmediator of wellbeing while highlighting a question of the role metacognitive\nprocesses have in types of rumination.\nContinuing the explanation of trauma, rumination and wellbeing as factors upstream\nto entrepreneurial outcomes (Triplett, Tedeschi, Cann, Calhoun and Reeve 2012)\nconducted a path analysis to identify how traumatic experiences lead to increased\nlife satisfaction. They identified the process of Deliberate Rumination (sometimes\nmediated/triggered by Intrusive Rumination) to be a core factor.\nMeaning and story making is a subtext across much of the literature read about\ntrauma and entrepreneurship. It is a concept which underlies rumination in the\npreviously discussed studies. As described in (Janoff-Bulman 1989) - a traumatic\nevent may lead to posttraumatic stress due to a break in our assumptive worlds, the\n\nM2 Lesc 20-21 - U.E. Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nschema we come to expect is no longer relevant. Meaning connects things, and\ntraumatic events and disruption disconnect them (Park 2010). It is becoming clear\nthat one way Deliberate Rumination supports Post-Traumatic Growth and through\nthat can support entrepreneurship in the developing world is through the\naccompanying resilience of PTG and the reappraisal and the telling of a new story.\nThe relationship between deliberate and intrusive rumination, affect, and action is\nbecoming a clear exploration area. (Baumeister and Wilson, 1996) identified four\nneeds for meaning: Need for purpose, need for value/justification, the need for\nefficacy, and finally the need for self-worth. (Bullough et al., 2014) have demonstrated\na relationship between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and resilience with\nEntrepreneurial Intent. The integration of self-efficacy between the needs for\nmeaning and a component supporting entrepreneurial intent demonstrates the\ncomplex web of effects that inspire or dim the light on entrepreneurship\nmotivations.\nLastly, Posttraumatic Growth is identified through the development of specific\ncharacter strengths. (Peterson 2008) demonstrated the development of particular\nCharacter Strengths for individuals who have gone through a traumatic experience\nat some time in their lives. Peterson identified this growth an arbitrarily long time\nafter the traumatic event without conducting an intervention; this is intriguing since\nit reinforces the theory (Bonanno 2004) proposes - that resilience and Post-traumatic\ngrowth are the general response most people undergo posttraumatic experience as\na part of the natural healing process. While Bonanno suggests that some\ninterventions (journaling to help with reappraisal) may encourage Post-Traumatic\nGrowth, the research demonstrates many paths to PTG and many people find it\nindependently. An uplifting perspective.\n4/ Limits of the existing studies\nMeasurement challenges:\nThe majority of the papers in this study used self-reported measures and\nrecommended alternative approaches to assessing factors. (Bernoster et al. - 2020)\n\nM2 Lesc 20-21 - U.E. Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nIssues with non-longitudinal studies: How to define success? Measuring Self\nEfficacy and Resilience, as correlates to Entrepreneurial Intent (Bullough 2013), found\nconvincing evidence. However, without measuring entrepreneurial behavior and\nentrepreneurship impact (jobs created, families sustained, the positive impact of\nentrepreneurial activities), the demonstration of the correlation between resilience\nand self-efficacy with entrepreneurial intentions opens the doors to longitudinal\nstudies exploring outcomes of those intentions.\nAlong with desiring to validate their study across in diverse cultures outside Spain\nand Portugal, (Mortan 2014) identified that their research is limited by the shortage\nof empirical evidence on the relationship amongst Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy and\nhow it is related to Emotional Intelligence and Entrepreneurial Intention. (Mortan\n2014)\n5/ Research question\nSome questions emerge after reviewing the literature: How does engaging in an\nentrepreneurial task impact emotions - how are they reciprocal? Are there\npositive/negative spirals, and how what starts them, stops them, encourages them?\nWhat are the interrelationships between emotion and cognition and entrepreneurial\nphenomena (Shepherd, 2015)? What is the relationship between metacognition,\nrumination and entrepreneurial self-efficacy?\nAll important questions. Due to prior acquisition of Character Strengths Data\n(pre/post) for people within and without an entrepreneurship program (ACSI)\nidentifying changes and after the Beirut Blast of 2020, there is an opportunity to ask\na new question:\nWhat factors supported the development of Character Strengths and PTG for\nentrepreneurs in Lebanon after the Beirut Blast?\nThe relevant factors can be determined through qualitative interview referencing\nsome of the concepts referred to in this literature review (rumination, PTG,\n\nM2 Lesc 20-21 - U.E. Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nmetacognition, social support, etc.). A theoretical model will be developed to identify\nthe strongest correlations that buffered the individuals within the ACSI program\nfrom a 1 point drop in their Character Strengths their peers outside the program\nexperienced. This knowledge will support other entrepreneurial educators in\nsimilarly challenging environments to improve their programs and support\nentrepreneurs working to create a better world. This knowledge will help conflict\nzone entrepreneurs grow from their challenges, like a phoenix.\n6/ Reference\nGorgievski, M. J., & Stephan, U. (2016).

In Lebanon, the\naddition of an economic collapse and a major explosion in the capital city brought acute\nstressors, triggering migration ideation. This research analyzes motivation for migration and\nsocial entrepreneurial ideation as well overall wellbeing for social entrepreneurs.\nPurpose: In this study, we aim to extrapolate the factors that support social entrepreneurs\nwellbeing and motivation by analyzing the relationship between resilience, posttraumatic growth\n(PTG), and character strengths within a training program in Beirut.\nMethodology: After gathering a broad set of data (pre-post assessments of Character Strengths,\nPost Traumatic Growth Inventory, Rumination, Entrepreneurial Intent, Resilience, Impact of\nEvent - Revised) we conducted a qualitative analysis to assess and tag responses. Correlations\nwere identified with factors that support post traumatic growth, resilience and social\nentrepreneurial ideation.\nFindings/Conclusions: While each person’s life journey is unique, we have identified that social\nentrepreneurship ideation is promoted by prior traumatic experiences, followed by opportunities\nand support for growth. Traumatic experiences are inescapable in life, and the opportunity\neducators and trainers have is to understand how to shift the trauma response curve towards\ngrowth. Deliberate Rumination, thinking and reflecting about one’s life circumstances can be\nincorporated into group facilitations. Character Strengths are correlated with PTG and there are\nvalidated methods for reliably developing strengths of character. One highly leverable strength is\nhumor, and one way humor can support growth is by preventing helplessness.\nImplications: The results of this study increases an understanding of the complex decision\nmaking individuals face in a crisis, and offers insights into the factors which support\nposttraumatic growth and contributing to society through social entrepreneurship. We hope the\n3\n\nresults of this paper inspire facilitators to incorporate humor, positive structured conversation and\nto enliven their program with character development.\nIntroduction\nHomo Sapiens and Neanderthals coexisted for thousands of years. Both species were tool users,\nsophisticated in their socialization, and both made seafaring vessels. Yet, there is one crucial\ndifference : although Neanderthals had the physical technology to cross the seas and spread to\nnew lands, only Homo Sapiens did. It appears that Homo Sapiens are successful as a species in\npart due to our appetite for risk, our ability to sail out into the endless sea with hope for a further,\nmore profitable shore (Stringer 2012, see figure 1). It might be that our presence on every\ncontinent on Earth is a testimony to our entrepreneurial instinct.\nOn the other hand, in the mathematical field of dynamical systems theory, the concept of an\nattractor is the set of states that draws a system together. Societies and people tend to stay in their\nsteady states until an extreme situation is thrust upon them, creating an opportunity for creating a\nnew steady-state system. In (Triplett, K. N., Tedeschi, R. G., Cann, A., Calhoun, L. G., & Reeve,\nC. L. 2011) the researchers described the nodes in the dynamical system of someone going\nthrough a traumatic experience as Core Beliefs.\nThis research paper reviews 21 social entrepreneurs working in Lebanon precisely throughout\nsuch a destabilizing event. Over the year 2020, Lebanese entrepreneurs experienced a failed\npopular uprising, the spread of the coronavirus, a currency devaluation, and the Beirut Port\nExplosion, which killed over 200 people and injured thousands of others while leaving 300,000\npeople homeless.\nConducting qualitative and quantitative research to explore the impact of the explosion and\npotential for Post Traumatic Growth alongside other factors, this research paper attempts to\nanalyse the decision making at an inflection point for social entrepreneurs.\nIn an attempt to create scalable impact from limited dollars, iNGOs (international Non Profit\n4\n\nOrganizations) are increasingly looking to support social businesses. Market prices track\ninternational events such as wars and famine to extreme weather events, and thus we can make\nan assumption about the general volatility of the world at large by reviewing the CBOE Volatility\nand the CBOE Volatility of Volatility indexes (see figure 2). Judging from the fact that 2020\nexperienced the highest rate of volatility in March after the beginning of the coronavirus\npandemic it is evident how market volatility can map to indirect market forces, chaos in the\nworld. The VOV index shows a slight, yet clear trendline - the world is becoming more volatile.\nThe US Army War College defined the concept of VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex,\nAmbiguous) during the cold war (UNHCR 2021), and recently announced a new peak in the\nnumber of international refugees, increasing the interconnection of people adding to the\ncomplexity and destabilizing societies. We find trends indicating increased political polarization,\nclimate change, increasing pandemics and financial instability, and in the face of the lack of\ntrusted political systems social entrepreneurship is seen as a counterbalancing force, especially\nwhere there already are systemic challenges, like Lebanon. To systematically address the many\nglobal challenges, recently framed by the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), many\nmultinational NGOs and international development organizations are establishing funds and\noffering support for social entrepreneurial activities. The vision is to create a triple bottom line\nbetween people, the planet, and profits through social entrepreneurship.\nThe question underpinning the research on a pool of 21 social entrepreneurs (with half in an\nentrepreneurial program and half outside of it) centers on the question: how do we nurture and\nmotivate social entrepreneurs in a values oriented program? We attempt to answer this question\nby understanding the impact of the traumatic event (IES-R) for “fight”, their deliberate and\nintrusive rumination amongst social entrepreneurs in Lebanon for “flight” and their potential\nresulting growth (PTGI) for “freeze”. We will describe the reasoning for the mapping shortly.\nPrevious research by Christopher Peterson has demonstrated that improvements in Character\nStrengths are correlated with improvements in the Post Traumatic Growth Index, for people that\n5\n\nexperience major life difficulties (Peterson 2008). And, importantly, there’s a growing body of\nevidence that there are character strength interventions that support people in developing their\nstrengths (Schutte, N. S., & Malouff, J. M. 2018).\nThis inquiry eventually allowed us to identify factors which support social entrepreneurs along\nthe three dimensions of responding to the blast: fighting, fleeing or freezing. We’ve mapped\nthem to the Self Determination Theory (SDT) of Motivation (Deci & Ryan 2008) (Autonomy,\nMastery and Relatedness). This helps us create a map of understanding about how a traumatic\nevent might influence the motivation of entrepreneurs (SDT), and will give us measures to\nunderstand how to measure change on the relevant variables. Additionally, it gives us tools to\nsupport entrepreneurs in a deeper understanding of themselves and their situations, as well as\ntools to help develop the strengths of character that they value - and which will hopefully help\nthem find flushing in life, no matter the external situations and no matter how they choose to\nrespond to the crisis.\nHeading SDT Measures / Questions Support For\nFighting Autonomy Resilience and social / revolutionary ideation.\nWho gets out on the streets/commits to their\nsocial business?\nEngagement\nFlight Relatedness Deliberate Rumination. How does how we talk\nabout the situation affect growth and how does\ngrowth affect thoughts about leaving?\nDialog\nFreeze Competency PTGI and Character strengths. How can we use\nhumor to help break the ice?\nPost\nTraumatic\nGrowth\nA subset of character strengths correlate to the above measures and can be interesting areas\nfor further interventional research.\n6\n\nInterestingly, there is only one factor in our study that correlates with social entrepreneurial\nideation, and that is if they have experienced a prior traumatic experience and were able to\ndescribe it articulately during the interview. It seems that trauma can open a door to increase\ncompassion, reject the traditional narrative of fitting into the economy with a “real job”, and help\npeople in connecting with a higher purpose. With this as our starting point, we explore the\nfactors that support people in developing the self awareness and strength of character to grow\nafter a traumatic experience.\nTable of Contents\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nTable of Contents\nMethodology\nQualitative Analysis:\nQuantitative Data:\nChallenges:\nData Analysis and Insights:\nFlight\nFreeze… or Laugh\nConclusion\nFigures:\nCitations:\n7\n\nMethodology\nWe’ve used a qualitative analysis method for the exploration of our research, in an attempt to\nidentify potentially unseen variables. These unseen variables support the exploration of those\nfactors that contribute to, or detract from commitment, to social entrepreneurship. The author of\nthis paper has been able to utilize their position as the head of Research And Development at\nBloom, an organization which operates social enterprise acceleration and education programs.\nPrior to the Beirut Port Explosion in August 2020, the participants and applicants for the Bloom\nsocial entrepreneurship accelerator program had already taken the Values In Action Character\nStrengths Inventory (VIA-IS). At the conclusion of the four months long accelerator, and\nfollowing the Beirut Explosion, the applicants who were not selected as well as the participants\nwho were a part of the program requested to complete a post-test VIA-IS inventory. An analysis\nof the pre/post test data for the VIA-IS demonstrated a buffering effect experienced by\nindividuals who were a part of the Bloom program, which led to in-program individuals\nmaintaining their overall VIA average while individuals outside the program experienced a\nsignificant drop. To understand this phenomenon was the genesis of this research, and inspired\nthe qualitative/quantitative research methodology described below.\nQualitative Analysis:\nThe qualitative analysis consisted of twenty one 1.5 hour long interviews, which were all\nconducted remotely and recorded digitally. The interviewees were split with 10 people coming\nfrom outside the training program and 11 people who had gone through the training program\n(marked as “In prog.”). The questions for the interview were segmented into the following\nthemes:\nTopic Key Insight Explored\nIntroduction and Background Work habits and family entrepreneurial background\nEthnographic Questions What is their educational/ family's income level?\n8\n\nEntrepreneurial Intent (EI) What is their level of commitment to entrepreneurship?\nImpact of Event Scale (IES-R) What was the level of impact of the Beirut Explosion?\nResilience (BRCS) What is their level of resilience?\nPost Traumatic Growth Index\n(PTGI)\nHow much did people grow after the Beirut Explosion?\nRumination Scales What is the ratio of deliberate and intrusive rumination?\nConcluding Statements What does entrepreneurship mean in places facing\ninstability?\nThe interview consisted of open ended questions as well as questions requesting a qualitative\nresponse. Both questions were answered live on the call, allowing the interviewee to offer deeper\ncontext into the numerical responses. The audio for the interviews were transcribed manually,\nand an inductive process was followed to derive codes. The interview corpus was then brought\ninto a software supporting bi-directional links through which code clusters were identified.\nQuantitative Data:\nDuring the semi-structured interview process, alongside the open-ended questions, the\ninterviewer also gathered quantitative answers for the following measures:\n1. Post Traumatic Growth Index (PTGI Tedeschi & Calhoun 1996)\n2. The Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS Sinclair and Wallson 2004)\n3. The Impact of Event Scale: Revised (IES-R DS Weiss 2007)\n4. The Intrusive - Event Related Rumination Inventory (EERI Cann et al., 2011)\n5. Entrepreneurial Intention (EI) scale derived from Luthje & Frank (2003); Duijn (2009) /\nKrueger et al. (2000)\n6. The VIA Inventory referenced above. Peterson, C., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2004)\n9\n\nA subset of the codes derived from the interview corpus were identified as meaningful\nsegmentation markers, and each interview was then tagged in the database for analysis with the\nobserved value.\nSegmentation Tags:\nProperty Fields Description\nHas_Therepist True/False/Unsure Does the individual attend therapy?\nInjury_From_Blast True/False/Unsure Was the interviewee injured in the\nBeirut Port Explosion?\nEntrepreneurial_Family True/False/Unsure Does the interviewee come from an\nentrepreneurial family?\nPlacebuilding_Ideation True/False/Unsure Is the interviewee committed to\nusing their working life to\ncontribute to society?\nMigration_Ideation True/False/Unsure Is the interviewee considering\nmigrating out of Lebanon?\nRevolutionary_Ideation True/False/Unsure Does the interviewee politically\nactive, engage in protests, view\ntheir work as activism?\nIncome_Simplified Lower/Middle/Upper How does the participant view their\nfamilies income bracket?\nMeditation True/False/Unsure Does the participant have an active\nmeditation practice?\n10\n\nThe reasoning behind having a qualitative and quantitative approach was to be able to identify\nunforeseen variables through the interviews, while simultaneously having validated measures for\nimportant features like the Impact of The Event Scale (IES-R). This allows us to have a\nqualitative comparison point with which to compare interviews and derive insights.\nChallenges:\nFollowing an inductive tagging methodology, in which novel categories were derived from\ninterviews, led to a challenge in which not all participants were asked relevant questions. For\nexample, it became clear that prior experience with violence - such as living through the 2006\nwar - may have potential relevance on the responses people had to the current time of tumult.\nThis observation led some of the data in our table to be segmented to three categories: True,\nFalse and Unsure.\nAnother challenge came up in regards to perceived social expectations of the interviewer during\nthe interview, sometimes referred to as Demand Characteristics, a theory expounded on by Orne,\nMartin T. (2009). Some participants qualified their responses with statements like: “I only put a\nfour because I didn’t experience it directly myself.” This happened on repeated occasions with\nindividuals who seemed to be embarrassed by the fact that they were feeling high levels of\nnegative impact from the effects of the Beirut Port Explosion, without actually witnessing it\ndirectly, being injured or knowing people who have been injured or killed.\nThe process of going wide with the qualitative interview and going deep with the quantitative\nmeasures has exposed variables and areas of study that would not have been obvious at the start\nof the research process. To add a final note, the VIA-IS assessment was done as an online\nquestionnaire outside the interview structure allowing us to compare pre-post tests, and with the\nentire set of VIA Inventories conducted with 260+ entrepreneurs.\n11\n\nData Analysis and Insights:\nOverview of Data and Background Knowledge\nAfter a threatening situation, animals and humans respond in a variety of ways. Initially\ndescribed by Walter Cannon (Cannon, W. B. 1915) as the Fight or Flight response, the theory\nhas since then been adapted by Dr. Stephen Porges into Polyvagal theory (Porges 2009). This\nmodel now includes freezing as an alternative response, and attempts to correlate stress responses\nto neurohormonal responses. In the face of a situation in which no options seem viable, an\nindividual can either choose to fight, flee (flight) or freeze. We will be using these three types of\nresponses as a framing for potential ways our interviewees responded to the Beirut Blast.\nIn 2011, Martin Seligman (Seligman 2011) made the hypothesis that PERMA (Positive Emotion,\nEngagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) comprises well-being, and argues\nthat the model is helpful for measurement as well as for application (Seligman 2018).\nBefore we get into the analysis of the data, please review the prior description of the data and\ndata gathering phase. If you would like to explore the data yourself, you can find a public dataset\navailable to review here: http://bit.ly/cs-data-21\nThe Character Strengths data was gathered as part of the application process for a social\nentrepreneurship program before the August 4th, 2020 explosion. After the explosion, to\nunderstand deeper changes in entrepreneurial ideation we conducted a second VIA-IS as well as\na new questionnaire using the new measures described above. To start the exploration as to the\nfactors which support social entrepreneurs we keep in mind the question: who grows as a social\nentrepreneur in times of adversity and who reprioritizes the notion of their career trajectory to\nfocus more on self preservation. In 2008 Christopher Peterson (Peterson et al. 2008)\ndemonstrated a positive correlation between the VIA-IS Character Strengths Inventory and the\nPost-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). The PTGI measures\ngrowth on the dimensions of Appreciation, New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Spiritual\n12\n\nEnhancement and Personal Strength; interestingly, all of these dimensions are relevant for social\nentrepreneurial ideation. Comparing PTGI with the Character Strengths assessment we identify\nthat Humor, Teamwork, Spirituality, Prudence and Judgement have a significant correlation for\nPTGI across the five sub-dimensions, see figures below.\nData validity questions.\nWe initially hypothesized that there would be a correlation between CS prepost (Character\nStrengths Difference in average scores assessed before/after the blast) and Post Traumatic\nGrowth. While there seems to be a slight correlation between CS prepost and PTGI -\nAppreciation (.33 p-val .14) we cannot at this time with our limited data make any strong\nstatements about Character Strength changes before/after an explosion and PTGI. One factor\ncould be that the time frame for the post test was taken over a 3 month period (December -\nMarch 2020) and it might be interesting to study a progression of changes rather than comparing\npre and post. Growth takes time and measuring over an extended period confuses the data. Also,\nassessing people earlier, and therefore closer to the period of the traumatic event may not have\nleft time to metabolize the experience while people who filled in the assessment later have had\nmore opportunities. Another bias that may be influencing the data is potentially the types of\npeople who submit forms early compared to those who wait may also capture proactive people\nearly in the recovery process and procrastinators later in their process. Rather than adding\nanother factor to control for procrastination, I propose future assessments to include deadlines for\ninclusion into the dataset, or to include time of receipt as an influencing factor.\nAnd now, we begin to explore motivation and wellbeing for entrepreneurs following the Fight,\nFlight and Freeze framework.\nFight\nAfter the Beirut Explosion, many of the interviewees were feeling anger. Although anger may be seen as a\nnegative state, we found that many of the participants used their anger towards a factor we called\n13\n\nRevolutionary Ideation, clicking this link will take you to see sections of the interview tagged with this\nconcept.\n“Angry at the government, of course. Angry that the city I love was destroyed. The nice things\nabout our city were destroyed in a second because of the irresponsibility of the people governing.\nOf course I went to the protest that happened immediately after” - Interview 006\nSome people went to the streets to protest, while others viewed their entrepreneurial activity as\ntheir “action” in response:\n“With the revolution came many different revolutions... one of the revolutions we're making is in\neducation. And I say that I'm an activist and not on the ground - it's our revolution in education.\nI don't think the revolution is only about going down and doing it violently. It's about rethinking,\nunlearning, recreating. Putting aside everything traditional / forced upon us / trying to make a\ndifference. not just to make money. Money is not the aim, it's the reward. It's not the reward I'm\naiming for. The impact is the aim I want. There's lots, revolutions in media, education, revolution\nin feminism/sexuality. This awareness is coming out and has been a social revolution not only\n(taboo). Not just a gov /political revolution, it's everything. This is my revolution.”\n-Interview 019\n14\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, the majority of participants with revolutionary ideation\ncame from people who were not intending to leave Lebanon, even after the blast. While\nrevolutionary thinking and political engagement is not the primary focus of this paper, it is worth\nbeing included here since many of the inspiration for social entrepreneurs comes from areas the\npublic sector is lacking in, and can be seen as a form of direct action. Most of the social\nentrepreneurs interviewed for this paper were operating businesses solving problems in the\ndomain of education.\nAnother important reason to consider the idea of “Fighting” and using the feeling of Anger is\nthat it is a fact bound to happen, especially when paired with major traumatic events. So rather\nthan avoiding the feeling, we can sublimate anger to increase the critical factor of engagement to\nprevent freezing, complacency, and inaction. While the language of fighting is not necessarily\npositive, it does imply a high degree of activation and purpose, something important to maintain\nin the face of conflict and insurmountable odds.\n15\n\nThe measure we’ve selected for “Fight” is resilience, labeled BRCS (Sinclair and Walston\n2004), it measures the following questions on a 5 point scale:\n1. I look for creative ways to alter difficult situations.\n2. Regardless of what happens to me, I believe I can control my reaction to it.\n3. I believe I can grow in positive ways by dealing with difficult situations.\n4. I actively look for ways to replace the losses I encounter in life.\nActing as an antidote to the potential freezing reflex, resilience inspires action and engagement.\nWhile focusing on character strengths development has been shown to support wellbeing factors\ndescribed by PERMA (Goodman & Kauffman 2017), there appears to be a subset that stands out\nin our set of interviews. The components of this subset are the following : Hope, Humor,\nSelf-Regulation, Social-Intelligence and Teamwork. We can see that these are especially\ncorrelated with resilience, and may be interesting to explore as in future studies.\nWhat might not support direct engagement? The following table presents negative correlations\nbetween Revolutionary Ideation that we can find identified in the data, there are no strong\npositive correlations to present.\n16\n\nThe relationships that stand out to me are the relationship between Prudence, having a child and\nRevolutionary Ideation. Prudent parents are less likely to be engaged in protests and other types\nof activism. Another strong correlation is with Spirituality. Diving into how one mother\nresponded to the explosion we can see both features at play:\n“No, nothing changed. God's will will still happen as it should. Nothing has changed. I worked\nas a mother to prevent the impact from impacting my children much so they don't stay home\nalone. I didn't have much capacity to go to the site to volunteer. Fadi my brother was there and\nsaw the fire that became the blast and was more present. I personally focused on making sure\nmy children would cross this situation without harm. Fadi worked on support.”\n-013 Interview Spirituality rank 7/24 & Has_Child True\nWhile the strength of Spirituality contributes positively to Post Traumatic Growth through the\n“Spiritual Enhancement” facet, there is a concern that over-focusing on the strength of\nspirituality could lead to spiritual bypassing, which is a coping strategy where people use\nspiritual ideas to avoid facing unresolved emotional issues and development tasks. Spiritual\n17\n\nbypassing was coined by John Welwood and developed in (Cashwell, C. S., Glosoff, H. L., &\nHammond, C. 2010).\nInterviewee number 18 expressed the balance between trusting in the “Will of God” and\ndeveloping and engaging in acts of control like this:\n“We do have control over that, if it's going to happen it's going to happen. If maybe we knew\nabout it, maybe it's going to happen anyway. We're destined to have this. There's a saying in the\n(The Islamic Spiritual Tradition), aqqqalal (Arabic for use your brain/do something rational)\nwatawakal (Arabic for rely on God) - before submitting (to the will of God) do what you have to\ndo. DO what we should do and at the end of the day what's going to happen is going to\nhappen.”\n-018 Interview\nFigure 6 in the figures section below displays an interesting chart exposing some relationships\nbetween meditation, spirituality, revolutionary / social ideation. Spirituality is correlated with not\nhaving a therapist perhaps indicating that people with a stronger spiritual practice don’t identify\nwith the need to find a therapist. This is interesting because it seems that having a therapist\ncorrelates with deliberate rumination and meditation. Reviewing age seems to indicate that the\nyounger generations are more open to therapy and meditation alongside their religious and\nspiritual beliefs.\nOne takeaway from the above analysis is that creating mixed communities of practice where\nvarious spiritual, religious, therapeutic ideas are shared openly might create an opportunity for\nalternative perspectives to be displayed and their results seen, either amplifying or dampening\nthe ideas that the group selects as valuable. This might be an important task for course designers\nand facilitators to navigate carefully. 013 expressed a value in action by nurturing their child,\nwhile 019 demonstrated Bravery and a rallying cry to contribute socially in a time of\nrevolutionary change. In relation to the theme of this section, both of them are putting up a good\nfight and are engaged in a values informed course of action.\n18\n\nFlight\nTraumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image\nand worldviews, and while possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and\npositive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A.\nM., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how people choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous\nsection we described people who engage (flight), this time, let’s discuss migration (flight).\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic happens. Prior to\nthe blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge where the World Bank data indicates that about 40\npercent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates leave Lebanon upon graduation\n(WorldBank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what the migration impact of the explosion\nwill be, the total population of Lebanon has dropped .44% last year and (Ibrahim 2020) reports\nthat the number of people leaving Lebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the\nblast. Understanding the decision making process of social entrepreneurs is critical since they are\nan important part of the population working on creating stability and creating positive reasons for\npeople to stay, either through their services, as employees or customers.\nThis snippet of dialog from an interview demonstrates in real time holding multiple perspectives\nand ends with a contradiction, to desire to want to stay.\n“For instance if I had kids. If I was in Beirut/ lost a close family member I may have thought I\nwould leave. Fortunately for me I don't’, it’s related to how much they can take. My brother is\nleaving for France in September, I can't leave everyone/my family. We have the family business,\nmy father is relatively old. And I want to stay here willingly.”\n-004 Interview\nThe research strategy was initially going to divide the population into “those who stay and build”\nand “those who leave and protect themselves and their families” - during the coding process we\n19\n\nfound that the decision is emotional some people want to leave and contribute, and some want to\nstay and contribute, and many others have competing commitments that are unclear. Sometimes\nthe interviewee demonstrates deep self knowledge and desires to leave for strategic reasons, to\ncontinue to be able to offer their work life as a service to their community they need to stay safe,\nsane and alive:\n“I won't lie, sometimes I feel like leaving too. Why do I think about it? To keep this\nengine/enthusiasm/giving to people I have to feel secure. Not that I will die at any instant. So\nmuch is online so I can do so much of my work online. I can be effective even if I’m not\nphysically in the country. I think of my safety, my family… and my earnings. Now I’m fine.\nAfter a while will I still be fine? I’m investing from my income, will I still be able to invest in\nmy team? That’s the one thing I’m thinking about. I’m investing in the base, raising this “child”\nso that one day the company will come and pay me back and take care of me when I’m older.\nThank goodness God has given me a salary. I see tangible results. We’re going to print the book\nand sell it and make money from it. I can see it all. It's not like we’re playing and not doing\nanything.\n-002 Interview\nThis powerful snippet from the interview shows the strategic process 002 has taken to rationalize\nher potential departure from Lebanon. Some questions arise as to how much the combination of\nthe massive spread of the coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown supports people in their\nmigration ideation. It could be that as people have spent much of 2020 indoors people now, like\n002, have taken their social entrepreneurship programs online and have less of a physical\ninvestment in their physical environments.\nOther interviewees have a clearer commitment to leaving and do not seem conflicted in any way:\n“I live with my mom/brother. And we are all affected by the situation of course. Because before\nthat - the port - we already had the economic situation and we were feeling safe since a long time\nnothing happened security wise. we heard it could happen again. We don't feel safe anymore.\n20\n\nI don't have foreign nationality, so I decided not to take a French one. It's complicated to find a\njob, it's a safe thing to do to have a possibility if one has to go outside Lebanon. I would be\ninterested in leaving if I had an opportunity. Someone said for Canada. Someone said it's very far\nand they don't take Lebanese for my age. For security reasons I could go to France for example.\nIt's a sure avenue, I need a challenge in my life. I don't like routine.”\n-Interview 017\n“Participants who maintain calm and develop adaptive self-regulating practices Actually my\nthinking is everyone is thinking about leaving. Something inside me that doesn't want to leave\ndespite everything. I don't know why I'm still calm. I see the craziness all around us. The best\nthing you can do is focus with what you have, and how you can help others with what you have.\nIf you focus on all the bad things around us you can't work. What I decided is to help and doing\nwhat I can do and keeping my mental health and family health and that's how to survive\neverything. Of course we felt very bad and it was very stressful for us and all these feelings. I\njust wanted to stay calm.”\n-014 Interview\nAlbert Bandura’s Social Cognition Theory (Bandura 1989) proposes that a portion of knowledge\nacquisition comes from social evaluation, from our data we see that people modulate their\nmigration ideation based on many factors, one of which is how and who they speak to about it.\nTraumatic events disrupt the standard narrative model needing new stories to support meaning,\nsuggests Neimeyer in (Neimeyer, R. A. (2004), how are those narratives reconstructed? In a\npaper developing a model of Post Traumatic Growth for cancer patients (Morris, B. A., &\nShakespeare-Finch, J. 2011) identified Deliberate Rumination as a strong influencing factor for\nPTG. Further research demonstrated the relationship between PTG and life satisfaction through\nthe factor of meaning:\n21\n\nIn the paper (Triplett et al. - 2012), they demonstrated that the disruption of core beliefs (CBIs)\ntriggers both intrusive and deliberate rumination and that the destabilizing aspects of a traumatic\nevent either supports a more meaningful life of satisfaction through deliberately contemplating\nthe experience, or can negatively affect meaning and life satisfaction through intrusive\nrumination.\nDeliberate Rumination is the process of choosing the questions and thoughts one has around a\ntraumatic event, for instance “what is the lesson I am learning through this” in contrast with\nIntrusive Rumination and Brooding which may take the tone of “why is this always happening to\nme”. We can see both examples in our interview data set. Observe as 018 reflects on discussions\nhad during a group dialog with other social entrepreneurs in the entrepreneurial training\nprogram:\n“...First I was thinking if we stay in this country, I can do anything in this country. Nothing\nlimiting me, why would I leave this country.... Why ... maybe I should have a backup country if\nsomething unexpected happens. Just having this backup country in mind can help me (with my\nproject). … Then(the start of the program) (projectName) (personName) starting asking which\ncountry do you want to go to? And I started thinking, first that ... I have friends, good nature,\nwhy leave? Then after the blast I have a different perspective of the country and started thinking\nof where I can go when/if something unexpected happens.”\n22\n\n--018 Interview\nOther examples of social cognition supporting someone positively through social media and\ndescribing the importance of having a community of positive social support to help create a\nsense of control and meaning as he adjusts his worldview through the development of spiritual\nand meditative practices:\n“A lot lot lot lot. After the blast I was majorly helped - writing affirmations. It helped me so\nmuch. I was in complete loss, not knowing what's happening, what the point of anything is. Self\nexistence questions that you ask yourself. One of the major affirmations, I am control of my\nreality even in times of uncertainty.\nThere's a beautiful instagram, called affirmation addict. Girl in California, I don't have the\napplication. I have a journal. I have a routine. Every two weeks. I cleanse my home with spiritual\nmusic. I started yoga. More meditation. I did a retreat for 5 days [...]\nI always have curiosity to learn more about these. They came at the right time. I have friends\nwho are more spiritual bess (but) i'm doing it alone. At my own pace. I have a collective of\nfriends around me that I'm inspired by.”\n-020 Interview\nIncluding moments of Deliberate Rumination in a social setting where trust is first established\ncan potentially support PTG. Including a focus on Strengths which support individuals' sense of\n23\n\nlife satisfaction and overall wellbeing is hypothesized to set a state of mind conducive to positive\nDeliberate Rumination.\nThe set of character strengths associated with our Deliberate Rumination dimension is\nJudgement, Social Intelligence and Teamwork. These traits do intuitively make sense as critical\nfactors for deliberate rumination and working together as a community to make difficult\ncollective decisions about traveling, building and relationships. We hope that by bringing a\ngreater awareness to these strengths of character people and programs will benefit from clearer\nthinking and more open discussion on what to do after difficulties arise.\nFreeze… or Laugh\nThe third response individuals have in the face of an overwhelmingly negative situation is to\nfreeze. In our interviews, we identify initial stages after the blast where many people felt stuck\nthrough expressing feelings of exasperation and frustration at the situation. Indicating they sense\na loss of control. These aspects connect to Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) through negating the\nopposite, post traumatic stress. Some of the symptoms of PTS are freezing, feeling numbness, an\ninability to act or care, holding one’s breath, a sense of dread…\nWhile it’s important not to overstate the case of PTS, in fact, most people respond quite\nresiliently as proposed by (Bonanno, G. A. 2004), also in order for people to experience the\npositive effects of PTG even the challenges and stressors of ordinary life can be enough of a\ntrigger to stimulate benefits (Ewert, A., & Tessneer, S. 2019). Before exploring people’s stress\nlet’s explore the positive correlations between PTGI and Character Strengths:\n24\n\nThe majority of the connection comes through the facet of PTGI-Appreciation.\n“...It's useless, they are not serving us by doing this. (Sharing news about the situation) They are\nproducing anger that can't turn into anything. The people are already angry from the economic\nissue. They don't have proof. One can sit and do theories for hours.”\n017 Interview\n“Khalas(exasperated form of “enough” in Arabic). I can't control anything… I need to control\nmy feelings thoughts rage.\n-020 Interview\n25\n\nAfter a month, yeah. In the first month I was consuming a lot of news about it and then I decided\nto stop. I was just depressing myself and I couldn't do anything about it and I disconnected\ncompletely and living my life as if nothing was going on. [[Code: Response-Self Protection]] I\nwasn't in Beirut, It wasn't as traumatic I was in Sawfar\n006 Interview\n“I didn't force myself to deal, when I wanted to cry. I was crying, when I didn't feel willing to do\nanything I didn't do anything.”\n010 Interview\nRather than freezing in response, some of the interviewees exhibited avoidant behaviors, which\nparallel freezing:\n“After the blast I didn't go to Beirut until just now. It was too heartbreaking, I didn't want to see\nit. We were impacted from the protests and the views. I was in a state of denial I didn't want to\nbelieve that this has happened. I only went yesterday because I //HAD// to get a vaccine. In some\nbuildings you see the effects of the blast, in other buildings it's been cleaned up.”\n010 Interview\nContrast the preceding statements with following statements which demonstrate interviewees\nengaging in highly motivated activities following the explosion:\n“When the blast happened, most businesses closed and people were cleaning up... When I was in\ngbeili - company, not antwork. I was looking at the employees and was thinking, don't you want\nto be in beirut helping other people? You could just go there and do something, this\npaperwork could be done another day.”\n019 Interview\n26\n\n“I still have nightmares, I have PTSD. Do you really want to know what it's like? I had some\ncalls with people from projectName. And suddenly the glass office I was in all collapsed and the\ncouch I was sitting on was full of glass. Allah itlatuf (God intervened with mercy) it was a matter\nof minutes. I was caught up on my way down to the floor below with my manager having a silly\ndiscussion when the blast happened. And the whole lower floor was full of blood, everyone had\nto be taken to the hospital. We were so scared to move. Because there were two we expected a\nthird. We all thought we were being blasted. Because of this we created a (product in response),\nit was a determination for us that (curseword) it we're staying. We're doing this for the country\ndespite all the (curse) we're living through. It was created after the blast as a demonstration\nthat we want to manufacture here, we want to create jobs, we want to build something for the\nkids that are deprived of toys, their childhood even.”\nhttps://roamresearch.com/#/app/EntrepreneurialResearch/page/ISYEjUAMD\nAggregating the pre-post tests from all the assessments we have before and after the blast, we\nfound that by segmenting our assessments by individuals in the entrepreneurial training program,\nthey have - on average - a one point increase in the measure of Humor in the VIA-IS inventory,\nover the course of the program. While Humor may be under-studied in academia, it correlates\nwith the CS prepost variable in our dataset.\n“CS Prepost” is a measure of the overall change in Character Strength before and after the Beirut\nPort Explosion. In the following table, we observe that humor and creativity both are factors\naffecting the preservation of Character Strengths. We used JASP and a classical regression\nmatrix since the variables are all continuous variables.\nSo what is a theory behind humor and this buffering effect? Humor has been linked to adaptive\ncoping and keeping a “light attitude” in the face of adversity (Ruch and Hofmann 2017). Humor\nis also an active response to take when other options are unavailable: people “break” the silence\nwith laughter, for example. This may be preventing the processes which lead to Learned\nHelplessness. Learned helplessness is one way to view the opposite of post traumatic growth for\n27\n\npeople living in highly chaotic and destabilized situations. Initially Learned Helplessness theory\nimplied that dogs experiencing inescapable shocks learned helplessness and persisted in helpless\nbehavior even when the situation became escapable later.\nRecent research has shed light on the neurological underpinnings of learned helplessness which\nhas application in uncertain times (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). Previously Learned\nHelplessness, as the name suggests, theorized that higher level mammals learn helpless behaviors\nwhen they are given inescapable negative experiences. Passivity in the face of a changed\nsituation, a situation where it behooves the animal to take action, is the hallmark of learned\nhelplessness. And while that behavior doesn’t change, our understanding of how it comes to be\nhas. Mammals, when confronted with prolonged adverse situations, develop an unlearned\nresponse of passivity. It is possible to overcome this bias towards passivity by learning and\nexerting control. What behaviors are available to act on?\nOne additional mechanism could have explanatory strength is the Broaden and Build theory\n(Fredrickson B. L. 2004) which espouses that positive emotions support people in expansive\nactivities, and taking action builds new capacity for further positive emotion, expansive activities\nand capacities. Humor combines the psychological insight and research from Fredrickson with\nthe neurological understandings of modern Learned Helplessness theory from (Maier, S. F., &\nSeligman, M. E. P. 2016). We can see that Humor is correlated with an overall growth of\ncharacter strengths from before and after the blast(CS prepost). Humor stands out as one of the\nonly factors that is directly connected to growth and stands out as a unique lens to look at both\nPTG(PTGI) and Resilience(BRCS) as it ties them all together as can be seen in the following\n28\n\nchart:\nThe court jester is the only person able to speak the truth when there is a crippling fear gripping\nthe court. Humor breaks the ice and we propose that it may also help sustain the neurological\nbasis for control. Humor is one of the factors we are exploring in this paper along the dimension\nof growth, the other is self reflection and emotional reappraisal through Deliberate Rumination\nand the third is Engagement as manifested in anger/political action as well as social\nentrepreneurial ideation.\nHumor, Engagement & Deliberate Rumination\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we investigated the Character Strength correlations with Resilience, Post\nTraumatic Growth and Deliberate Rumination. Since Character Strengths are correlated with\nPost Traumatic Growth and Wellbeing, and since there is a collection of applied interventions\nwith scientific validity, we hope this analysis helps educators working inside and outside\nconflict. The idea of “pre-silience” (pre+resilience) applies here with the recommendations for\nactions being more helpful in situations before there is a traumatic event.\nLet’s review the frame and identify the correlated character strengths:\n29\n\nHeading SDT Measure ->\nSupport\nCorrelated Character Strengths\nFight Engagement\nanger/political\nsocial\nentrepreneurial\nideation.\nAutonomy Resilience ->\nEngagement\nHope, Humor, Self-Regulation,\nSocial-Intelligence and Teamwork.\nFlight Deliberate\nRumination\nself reflection\nand emotional\nreappraisal\nRelatedness Deliberate\nRumination ->\nDialog\nJudgement, Social Intelligence and\nTeamwork.\nFreeze Growth\nHumor\nCompetency PTGI -> Growth Appreciation of Beauty, Fairness,\nHumor, Judgement, Leadership,\nModesty/Humility, Perspective,\nPrudence, Social Intelligence,\nSpirituality and Teamwork\nThe strengths that correlate with motivation and wellbeing with the highest correlations are\nTeamwork, Social Intelligence and Judgement.\nThe total list of strengths which emerged from our analysis is:\n1. Appreciation of Beauty\n2. Fairness\n3. Hope\n4. Humor\n5. Judgement\n6. Leadership\n7. Modesty/Humility\n30\n\n8. Prudence\n9. Perspective\n10. Self-Regulation\n11. Social Intelligence\n12. Spirituality\n13. Teamwork\nEveryone makes different decisions after a traumatic event, one size does not fit all in terms of\nhow best to design a pedagogy for social entrepreneurs. We hope this paper inspires more\nexploration around increasing motivation and wellbeing before the traumatic event, generating\n“presilience” so that when challenges come the psychological and social support are already in\nplace.\nOne thing is becoming more clear, it’s important to create spaces for truth speaking in the social\nentrepreneurship community, we must talk about our failures and fears as well as our successes.\nThese spaces can be where people explore ways of being and inspire each other through positive\nopen discussion around Character Strengths. These spaces could be a counter to the negativity\nbias seen on both social and traditional media. They offer a facilitated space to practice\ndeliberate rumination with the positive guidance of facilitators. It also supports the spread of\nvalue-laden idioms, aphorisms, and other easily digestible ideas, which become heuristics for\ndecision making.\nThe Character Strengths above come from a small sample study and the correlations do not\nimply causation. I hope this paper inspires others to take an applied approach to character\nstrengths explorations and also publish their data openly to build up a stronger evidence base for\nCharacter Strengths interventions.\n31\n\nI hope these findings make their way into communities of practice where social entrepreneurs\ncan collectively support each other to create the next viable steady-state system wherever they\nare.\nI want to end with two insights, one from one of the participants of the study and one from a\nfamous author:\n“...Values are the base of every human reaction and really, there's courage and motivation in\nevery person that's hidden and this very sad event created or awakened values in people. Those\nof compassion and courage, of motivation of solidarity and nationalism. Inspire nationalism even\nas people as they leaving the country. The people that are leaving the country, they still say my\ndream is to come back one day to Lebanon.\nMaybe they will go and come back.”\n--Interview 017\n“If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks\nand work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.”\n-Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\n32\n\nCitations:\nPeterson, C., & Seligman, M.

      "content": " Thank you for sharing your research and writings on post-traumatic growth and its applications in entrepreneurship education and support programs, especially in challenging contexts like Lebanon. I've reviewed the documents you provided, including your master's thesis, a draft article for Wamda, and your literature review. This is fascinating and important work. To help guide you towards developing an impactful paper, here are five questions:\n\n1. Your research identified several character strengths that correlate with post-traumatic growth, resilience, and entrepreneurial motivation, such as humor, teamwork, spirituality, and social intelligence. How might entrepreneurship educators and support organizations deliberately cultivate and leverage these specific strengths in their programs and interventions?\n\n2. The concept of \"pre-silience\" (pre+resilience) preparing entrepreneurs before challenges occur is intriguing. What might be some key elements and best practices of pre-silience training? How early in the entrepreneurial journey should this be incorporated?\n\n3. You mention the importance of creating spaces for entrepreneurs to engage in deliberate rumination, reflect on challenges, and inspire each other. What are some examples of how this could be structured and facilitated effectively in an entrepreneurship program? What resources or tools might help?\n\n4. Focusing on entrepreneur wellbeing seems to have both individual and societal benefits, contributing to the sustainability of social enterprises working on crucial issues. How can we make the case to funders, policymakers and other stakeholders to prioritize and invest in entrepreneur mental health and support systems?\n\n5. The buffering effect against declining character strengths for entrepreneurs in the support program is a key finding. To what do you attribute this \"protective factor\" - the curriculum, the relationships and social support, the act of deliberately reflecting via the research, or something else? What implications does this have for entrepreneurship program design?\n\nIn terms of an outline, here's a potential structure:\n\nI. Introduction \n- The challenges facing entrepreneurs, especially in volatile contexts\n- Post-traumatic growth as a framework \n- Character strengths and their correlation to PTG and entrepreneurial success\n\nII.

The findings suggest that involvement in a structured entrepreneurship program had a significant buffering effect on participants' character strengths, mitigating the decline observed in a control group. Specific character strengths, such as teamwork, spirituality, and social intelligence, were also found to correlate with measures of post-traumatic growth, resilience, and entrepreneurial motivation. These results highlight the protective role of entrepreneurship support programs and underscore the importance of cultivating key character strengths in building entrepreneur resilience and growth. Implications for program design and implementation in contexts of crisis and instability are discussed.\n\nTitle 2: Leveraging Character Strengths for Entrepreneurial Resilience: A New Framework for Targeted Support Interventions\n\nSubtitle: Insights from an Empirical Study of Lebanese Entrepreneurs in Times of Crisis\n\nAbstract:\nEntrepreneurial resilience is a critical factor in navigating the challenges and uncertainties of startup ventures, particularly in contexts of political instability, economic disruption, and social upheaval. This paper proposes a new framework for understanding and cultivating entrepreneurial resilience based on the targeted development of specific character strengths. Drawing on empirical data from a study of Lebanese entrepreneurs before and after the Beirut Port explosion of 2020, the authors identify significant correlations between character strengths such as humor, teamwork, spirituality, and social intelligence and measures of post-traumatic growth, resilience, and entrepreneurial motivation. The paper argues for the integration of character strength assessment and development into entrepreneurship education and support programs, and outlines a set of targeted intervention strategies aligned with the proposed framework. Implications for theory and practice are discussed, along with directions for future research.\n\nTitle 3: From Post-Traumatic Growth to Pre-Resilience: Reframing Entrepreneurship Education for Proactive Development\n\nSubtitle: Lessons from an Empirical Study of Resilience and Growth in Lebanese Entrepreneurs\n\nAbstract:\nThis paper challenges the dominant paradigm of entrepreneurial resilience as primarily a reactive process of post-traumatic growth, and proposes a proactive approach to building \"pre-resilience\" through entrepreneurship education and support programs. Drawing on insights from an empirical study of Lebanese entrepreneurs before and after the Beirut Port explosion of 2020, the authors introduce the concept of pre-resilience as the proactive cultivation of character strengths, skills, and mindsets that enable entrepreneurs to navigate future challenges and uncertainties. The paper identifies specific character strengths, such as teamwork, spirituality, and social intelligence, that were found to correlate with measures of post-traumatic growth, resilience, and entrepreneurial motivation, and argues for their intentional development in entrepreneurship curricula and support interventions. Strategies for fostering pre-resilience, including deliberate rumination practices and social support structures, are explored. The paper concludes with implications for entrepreneurship theory, educational practice, and support program design, and calls for a paradigm shift towards proactive resilience development in the face of increasing global challenges and uncertainties.\n\nThese titles, subtitles, and abstracts aim to highlight the unique contributions and insights from your research, while also situating them within the broader context of entrepreneurial resilience, education, and support in times of crisis and uncertainty.

      "content": " Based on your monologue, I have identified several key insights that connect your research findings to the broader literature on post-traumatic growth, entrepreneurial resilience, and support strategies. These insights highlight the importance of deliberate rumination, social support, character strengths, and proactive skill development in fostering growth and resilience in the face of adversity.\n\nCore golden insights:\n1. Spirituality can serve as a catalyst for deliberate rumination, prompting entrepreneurs to seek meaning and growth in the face of challenges.\n2. Social support and character strengths such as teamwork and social intelligence are crucial for promoting deliberate rumination and post-traumatic growth.\n3. Entrepreneurship education can be designed to cultivate character strengths and skills that support post-traumatic growth, such as zest, humor, and relationship building.\n4. Engaging in entrepreneurship can help individuals maintain a sense of agency and purpose in the face of chaos, but it is essential to frame stress as positive (eustress) rather than negative.\n5. Diverse networks, relationships, and funding sources provide entrepreneurs with resources and support to navigate challenges and promote resilience.\n6. Sharing circles and practicing vulnerability can foster connections and growth among entrepreneurs.\n\nBased on these insights, I have developed three distinct paper concepts that explore different facets of entrepreneurial resilience and growth:\n\nTitle 1: Cultivating Entrepreneurial Resilience: The Role of Character Strengths and Social Support in Post-Traumatic Growth\n\nSubtitle: Insights from a Study of Lebanese Entrepreneurs in Times of Crisis\n\nIntroduction:\nThis paper investigates the relationship between character strengths, social support, and post-traumatic growth among entrepreneurs in Lebanon, drawing on empirical data collected before and after the Beirut Port explosion of 2020. The findings suggest that specific character strengths, such as teamwork, social intelligence, zest, and humor, along with robust social support networks, play a crucial role in promoting deliberate rumination and growth in the face of adversity. The paper argues for the intentional cultivation of these strengths and support structures in entrepreneurship education and support programs to foster resilience and growth.\n\nConclusion:\nThe insights from this study underscore the importance of proactively developing character strengths and social support networks to promote entrepreneurial resilience and post-traumatic growth. By designing entrepreneurship education and support programs that prioritize the cultivation of key strengths such as teamwork, social intelligence, zest, and humor, along with fostering diverse relationships and resources, we can better equip entrepreneurs to navigate challenges and find meaning and growth in the face of adversity. This research calls for a shift towards a more holistic and proactive approach to entrepreneur development, one that recognizes the interconnectedness of personal and professional growth in the face of uncertainty and crisis.\n\nTitle 2: Navigating Chaos and Uncertainty: Entrepreneurship as a Pathway to Resilience and Agency\n\nSubtitle: Strategies for Reframing Stress and Cultivating Proactive Skills in Entrepreneur Development\n\nIntroduction:\nIn an increasingly volatile and uncertain world, entrepreneurship can serve as a powerful tool for individuals to maintain a sense of agency, purpose, and resilience in the face of chaos. However, the high levels of stress inherent in entrepreneurial pursuits can also pose significant risks to well-being and growth if not properly managed. This paper explores strategies for reframing entrepreneurial stress as positive (eustress) and cultivating proactive skills and mindsets that support resilience and growth. Drawing on insights from a study of Lebanese entrepreneurs navigating political and economic instability, the authors propose a framework for entrepreneurship education and support that emphasizes the development of key character strengths, diverse networks and resources, and practices of deliberate rumination and meaning-making.\n\nConclusion:\nAs global challenges and uncertainties continue to mount, it is increasingly essential to equip entrepreneurs with the skills, mindsets, and support systems needed to navigate chaos and find purpose and growth in the face of adversity. By reframing entrepreneurial stress as an opportunity for growth (eustress) and proactively cultivating key character strengths, diverse networks, and practices of deliberate rumination, entrepreneurship education and support programs can play a vital role in fostering individual and community resilience. This research offers a timely and practical framework for entrepreneur development in an age of uncertainty, one that recognizes the transformative potential of entrepreneurship as a pathway to agency, adaptability, and positive change.\n\nTitle 3: The Power of Connection: Fostering Entrepreneurial Resilience through Sharing Circles and Vulnerability\n\nSubtitle: Lessons from a Study of Social Support and Growth among Lebanese Entrepreneurs\n\nIntroduction:\nIn the face of adversity and uncertainty, social connection and support can be a lifeline for entrepreneurs seeking to build resilience and find growth. This paper explores the role of sharing circles and vulnerability practices in fostering entrepreneurial resilience, drawing on insights from a study of Lebanese entrepreneurs navigating the aftermath of the Beirut Port explosion of 2020. The findings suggest that creating safe spaces for entrepreneurs to share their experiences, challenges, and emotions can promote deliberate rumination, meaning-making, and post-traumatic growth. The authors propose a model for integrating sharing circles and vulnerability practices into entrepreneurship education and support programs, highlighting the benefits for individual and collective resilience.\n\nConclusion:\nThe insights from this study underscore the transformative power of social connection and vulnerability in fostering entrepreneurial resilience and growth. By creating safe and supportive spaces for entrepreneurs to share their experiences and emotions, we can tap into the collective wisdom and resilience of entrepreneurial communities and promote deliberate rumination and meaning-making in the face of adversity.

            "text": " Based on your monologue, I have identified several key insights that connect your research findings to the broader literature on post-traumatic growth, entrepreneurial resilience, and support strategies. These insights highlight the importance of deliberate rumination, social support, character strengths, and proactive skill development in fostering growth and resilience in the face of adversity.\n\nCore golden insights:\n1. Spirituality can serve as a catalyst for deliberate rumination, prompting entrepreneurs to seek meaning and growth in the face of challenges.\n2. Social support and character strengths such as teamwork and social intelligence are crucial for promoting deliberate rumination and post-traumatic growth.\n3. Entrepreneurship education can be designed to cultivate character strengths and skills that support post-traumatic growth, such as zest, humor, and relationship building.\n4. Engaging in entrepreneurship can help individuals maintain a sense of agency and purpose in the face of chaos, but it is essential to frame stress as positive (eustress) rather than negative.\n5. Diverse networks, relationships, and funding sources provide entrepreneurs with resources and support to navigate challenges and promote resilience.\n6. Sharing circles and practicing vulnerability can foster connections and growth among entrepreneurs.\n\nBased on these insights, I have developed three distinct paper concepts that explore different facets of entrepreneurial resilience and growth:\n\nTitle 1: Cultivating Entrepreneurial Resilience: The Role of Character Strengths and Social Support in Post-Traumatic Growth\n\nSubtitle: Insights from a Study of Lebanese Entrepreneurs in Times of Crisis\n\nIntroduction:\nThis paper investigates the relationship between character strengths, social support, and post-traumatic growth among entrepreneurs in Lebanon, drawing on empirical data collected before and after the Beirut Port explosion of 2020. The findings suggest that specific character strengths, such as teamwork, social intelligence, zest, and humor, along with robust social support networks, play a crucial role in promoting deliberate rumination and growth in the face of adversity. The paper argues for the intentional cultivation of these strengths and support structures in entrepreneurship education and support programs to foster resilience and growth.\n\nConclusion:\nThe insights from this study underscore the importance of proactively developing character strengths and social support networks to promote entrepreneurial resilience and post-traumatic growth. By designing entrepreneurship education and support programs that prioritize the cultivation of key strengths such as teamwork, social intelligence, zest, and humor, along with fostering diverse relationships and resources, we can better equip entrepreneurs to navigate challenges and find meaning and growth in the face of adversity. This research calls for a shift towards a more holistic and proactive approach to entrepreneur development, one that recognizes the interconnectedness of personal and professional growth in the face of uncertainty and crisis.\n\nTitle 2: Navigating Chaos and Uncertainty: Entrepreneurship as a Pathway to Resilience and Agency\n\nSubtitle: Strategies for Reframing Stress and Cultivating Proactive Skills in Entrepreneur Development\n\nIntroduction:\nIn an increasingly volatile and uncertain world, entrepreneurship can serve as a powerful tool for individuals to maintain a sense of agency, purpose, and resilience in the face of chaos. However, the high levels of stress inherent in entrepreneurial pursuits can also pose significant risks to well-being and growth if not properly managed. This paper explores strategies for reframing entrepreneurial stress as positive (eustress) and cultivating proactive skills and mindsets that support resilience and growth. Drawing on insights from a study of Lebanese entrepreneurs navigating political and economic instability, the authors propose a framework for entrepreneurship education and support that emphasizes the development of key character strengths, diverse networks and resources, and practices of deliberate rumination and meaning-making.\n\nConclusion:\nAs global challenges and uncertainties continue to mount, it is increasingly essential to equip entrepreneurs with the skills, mindsets, and support systems needed to navigate chaos and find purpose and growth in the face of adversity. By reframing entrepreneurial stress as an opportunity for growth (eustress) and proactively cultivating key character strengths, diverse networks, and practices of deliberate rumination, entrepreneurship education and support programs can play a vital role in fostering individual and community resilience. This research offers a timely and practical framework for entrepreneur development in an age of uncertainty, one that recognizes the transformative potential of entrepreneurship as a pathway to agency, adaptability, and positive change.\n\nTitle 3: The Power of Connection: Fostering Entrepreneurial Resilience through Sharing Circles and Vulnerability\n\nSubtitle: Lessons from a Study of Social Support and Growth among Lebanese Entrepreneurs\n\nIntroduction:\nIn the face of adversity and uncertainty, social connection and support can be a lifeline for entrepreneurs seeking to build resilience and find growth. This paper explores the role of sharing circles and vulnerability practices in fostering entrepreneurial resilience, drawing on insights from a study of Lebanese entrepreneurs navigating the aftermath of the Beirut Port explosion of 2020. The findings suggest that creating safe spaces for entrepreneurs to share their experiences, challenges, and emotions can promote deliberate rumination, meaning-making, and post-traumatic growth. The authors propose a model for integrating sharing circles and vulnerability practices into entrepreneurship education and support programs, highlighting the benefits for individual and collective resilience.\n\nConclusion:\nThe insights from this study underscore the transformative power of social connection and vulnerability in fostering entrepreneurial resilience and growth. By creating safe and supportive spaces for entrepreneurs to share their experiences and emotions, we can tap into the collective wisdom and resilience of entrepreneurial communities and promote deliberate rumination and meaning-making in the face of adversity. This research calls for a paradigm shift in entrepreneurship education and support, one that recognizes the importance of social and emotional dimensions of growth and resilience alongside technical skills and knowledge. By integrating practices of sharing and vulnerability into entrepreneur development programs, we can cultivate the social fabric and collective resilience needed to navigate an increasingly uncertain and interconnected world.",

Combining qualitative interviews with a pre-post analysis of entrepreneur character strengths, the findings underscore the importance of cultivating a sense of meaning and engaging in purposeful reflection to alchemize adversity into growth. The paper argues for the integration of spiritual practices and structured opportunities for deliberate rumination into entrepreneurship education and support programs, particularly in contexts of crisis and uncertainty. Theoretical and practical implications for fostering entrepreneurial resilience and social impact are discussed.\n\nConclusion:\nThe insights from this study suggest that spirituality and deliberate rumination are potent catalysts for post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs navigating contexts of crisis and uncertainty. By providing a framework for meaning-making and purposeful reflection on challenges, these practices can help entrepreneurs alchemize adversity into growth and renewed commitment to social impact. This research calls for a paradigm shift in entrepreneurship education and support programs, one that integrates spiritual development and structured opportunities for deliberate rumination alongside traditional skills training.

Bilal had run an entrepreneurial acceleration program for social impact entrepreneurs in Lebanon which happened to overlap with COVID, the start of the economic collapse and protest movements, as well as an enormous blast called the Beirut Port Explosion that destroyed many homes, buildings, offices, businesses and killed many people. Many of the participants were impacted physically and all impacted mentally. The research used a mixed methods approach focusing on the tool that was used prior to the blast to assess their VIA score (values in action characters profile from the school of positive psychology) it has been shown that the Flourishing measure and higher scores on VIA are correlated, thus we take this measure as a proxy for wellbeing. We also note individual factors like humor, teamwork, leadership and others seem to buffer participants from the negative impacts of the Blast. Our research attempts to identify factors that correlate with post traumatic growth as we witnessed that most of the participants that went through our program returned to their baseline VIA wellbeing proxy faster than those who only attended a two week program where we were able to assess them, and then we asked them to return for an assessment at the same time as when we assessed people that went through both the 2 week program and the 3 month program. We believe we identified something in the 3 month program that we’d like to isolate and theorize the operations of systematically to develop a framework and impleemntation suggestions for other programs, educational and in business, to support the development of “pre-resillience” aka: presilience.\n001 Interview\n[[Interview-Metadata]] [[001 Interview]]\n(The below should be filled with True False depending on what is found in interview)\n[[Direct_Blast_Experience_False]]\nInjury_From_Blast: False\nCode: Response-Migration Ideation: True\nPlacebuilding_Ideation: False\nKnow_Someone_Hurt: False\nHome_Damaged: False\nOffice_Damaged: False\n[[History/Background]] [[001 Interview]]\n[[Ethnographic Questions]] [[001 Interview]]\nGender: Male\nAge: 35\nAge-Range: 35-45\nOrigin: Akkar\nResidence: Tripoli\nFamily_Income_Bracket: Upper Middle\n[[Entrepreneurial Intent Questions]] [[001 Interview]]\nEI_Score: 35\nEI_Employment_Status: Self employed\nIf I find the correct project, then sure\nMy professional goal is becoming an entrepreneur (to run your own business)\nI like my independence  [[Code: Value-Independence]]\nI’ve got the firm(strong) intention to start a firm some day [[Code: Entrepreneurial-Ideation]] I've tried several other projects, several of them flopped.

And the whole lower floor was full of blood, everyone had to be taken to the hospital. We were so scared to move. Because there were two we expected a third. We all thought we were being blasted. Because of this we created a fireman (Ed) who was sewn in response, it was a determination for us that ^&*$# it we're staying.

Aye, kthier.\nWhat did the accelerator mean during the blast period?\nI still remember, noticing, during the weekly check ins - I was having a rough period in my life in June/July before the blast. I was done with school, I had graduated and there was hyperinflation. I felt I had to get a job to help the family sustain. I was actively looking and feeling panic and we were as a family operating on savings. My dad was telling me that my retirement was less than 10,000 dollars, imagine that. [[Code: Financial]] So it was crazy. I noticed I’m using the word “Frustrated a lot” - Munir mentioned that I was “frustrated a lot” and it stood out to me. I realized that being frustrated is not productive while you’re in a startup because you need to be innovative and creative and being frustrated doesn’t help you come up with new ideas. [[Code: Value-Self knowledge]] I got this thing with berrytech and finally I relaxed. [[Code: Safety]]\n1\nAll the calls were really so helpful. Not everyone was on the calls all the time, we wanted everyone to be there! People have lives and you can’t force people to always join.

My contract ends in June with Berrytech and I am very confident that I will get another opportunity somewhere else. I’ve been doing a lot of good [[Code: Personality Trait]]\nWhat role do you see entrepreneurs having in a place like Lebanon given the current situation?\nI strongly believe that entrepreneurs will save the region. We’re non-partisan, non-political, we’re grassroots, we’re in pain and from the pain we’re trying to do good and create products. I’m very proud of all the people working in startups, especially the people empowering people, teaching people how to think, sharing new skills. Everything involving human development is multiplied by 2000% because that’s someone doing something new and it has a ripple effect. When you empower a person you empower many more indirectly. Entities like Nawaya, Enjaz, Dot, who are getting money from outside, empowering people to start coming up with projects and I’m very happy with the sessions they give. I start telling them - I know the situation is hard, you need to make money, dollars, not Lebanese. The country has a lot of raw materials, but our minds are not industrial, when you think about how much goodness is in the country. As simple as flowers, honey, how can we innovate? The plentitude of potatoes in Bekaa? Create a market for you. Make the spoons from honey, it’s very nice. I buy it because we can, companies are making money. WHat can we invent. Create new products from the earth, learn e-commerce, we’re teaching you ecommerce. Learn the tools, it’s for free. As much as I can I’m trying to share this. Don’t make the same product and sell it in the same village. In Beirut no one makes authentic “mooneh” - we look for the people who do? There’s lots of people like me and expats who’re looking for Lebanese products, the smell of the region. [[Code: Expat-support]] The entities are teaching the skills they need to transform the resources around them into products. And this is how we will emerge from our problem, it’s industrialization and creating products.

New job opportunities/working opportunities. I have a job with UNDP, a lot of jobs were open and multiple positions were added. A group of friends started their own initiatives. They were more motivated to do a change, to do something. One friend wanted to start an NGO for 2 years, after the blast she started it the day after. It's called Ahla Wa Sahla. The main topic of the NGO is to allow people from different areas to visit other people and visit within lebanon. She still did this thing by supporting them to volunteer within Lebanon. To have an acceptance within. It's urgent now to have it.\nI have a stronger religious faith.\nI still have a lot of things I need to be doing, that's why 4 not 5.

The view that wouldn't be looked at mabyinshaf\nHow did the blast affect your thinking about your projects?\nNot related. you can work from an office or from home, it's much better when you're in a stable place. The blog I'm doing is not just for the lebanese people, it's to be exposed internationally. I'm already employed. I already know the status of being an employee. Even this is not a stable position. Both ways have risks. You should find a way to join both of them.

When people get injured/lost their lives/home/work/goods. This has been entertained mainly by the media. The memory. I was following the news so this happened all the time.\nI had trouble staying asleep\nJust the first week. Maybe because I haven't seen hurtful pictures.

[[Code: Adaptation]]\nDo you live with your family?\nCan you tell me about your history with entrepreneurship?\nCan you tell me about your decision making process when you decided to start your own business?\nHow do you manage cycles and people/time to pay?\nIncreasing freelancing opportunities - freelance for this cycle from our pool - this person has this much experience. We don't have to employ people. [[Code: Entrepreneurship-Solution to problems]]\nWhat's your history with DAOs? How'd that happen?\nWe had 7 partners and 15 volunteers. We had a really stressful period and wanted to deliver our application for the web summit. And we couldn't deliver after the second day. And we decided how to divide focus and stress. [[Code: Volunteering]]\nI liked working in a chaotic organization. More stress I felt safer.  I'm working 24/7 - other people don't sitting in an apartment in Marseille - looked at the 369 natural numbers. If nature works like this, how can we work like nature in the natural system? Took it as well from a military perspective. Brainstorm plan and execute.

Can't go out of focused line for operations.\nWhen we came back to Lebanon, 33 days is impossible. 33 hours hackathon.\n33 hours revolution in the egg. Tripoli - ardkon.com\nWhy do you feel safer with the more stress/the more you work?\nStress = the amount of focus that's requested in a certain period. We get overwhelmed by the pressure of the job. Make stress pure. Purify stress, it becomes focus. Without stress there's no real focus. It's urgency. StartUp of 7 people - i'm putting all my life into this, why should I not feel the pressure of the moment.

We thought the country was being bombed. Then we (brother) - I was checking on my brother. Two mins after the blast he was on the road. We were during a sprint, internal sprint during the team. Developed a map less than 5 hours to help with the rescue people, totally engaged on the phones. Decide to invest in Lebanon - people investing wanted to focus on leaving. Making a decision to invest in Beirut. [[Entrepreneurial_Family_True]]\nDid you know people affected by the blast directly?\nSome of them travelled outside the country. Some of them are struggling, most of them detached from what happened. Some of them are still missing the people they lost.\nWhy did you not leave: Marmkhayel = Beirut? We spent half of our lifetime in Beirut. We felt a responsibility towards our land, our people. Especially that we felt that we have the resources/knowhow and capacity to invest in the period. Profit and invest outside Lebanon or engage in humanitarian effort. Why not - we didn't think. [[Code: Feeling-Patriotism]]\nWhy did you decide differently from the other partners? Because I have a prehistory of political engagements with the country. The main thing was - we saw Beirut was going to be reconstructed. Either with the official vibe, or the alternative vibe. [[Code: Preparation]] [[Code: Entrepreneurial-Ideation]] [[Code: Value-Agency]]\nSaw an opportunity? It resulted with an opportunity. It has to be reconstructed, either another solidare or preserve the vibe that we work with. Money comes through established insitutitions. Most of the establishment institutions inhibit artists , more a commercial image for Beirut. not to have another commercial sector in the country. [[Code: Silver-Linings]]\nWhat are some of the changes in your life since the August 4th blast?\nTook a decision to start a new business. [[Code: Vision]]\nSince the collective energy is a bit more angry. You get affected, you can help yourself by the right people and the right environment - I feel privileged. I had two concussions because of the army throughout this year. [[Code: Experience-Physical harm]] [[Code: Ideation-Revolutionary]]\n1\nOnce during the protest. And once during the reconstruction of the old horseback riding club. Army checkpoint next to us. Enjoying the resources, we once told them, hey stop using our land, use your own place. The next day we had a small fight, barriers, they hit his mother, brother, concussion. [[Code: Experience-Physical harm]]\nAt the same time they had problems with tripooli so the army was ANGRY\nHow did the blast affect your thinking/thinking about your projects?\nThe truth won't ever be seen, there's no accountability, best thing to do is to make people's lives better. It's a failed system.\nAny reminder brought back feelings about it?\nEncountering new stories, new victims, we couldn't stop thinking, engaged in it.  [[Code: Feeling-Anger]] [[Code: Situation-Overwhelming]]\nOther things kept making me think about it.\nWe're seeing the destruction every day, we're seeing the orgs working with the victims every day. We're still working with the people reconstructing. We don't feel the time passing. [[Code: Response-Overworking]]\nI felt irritable and angry. [[Code: Feeling-Anger]]\nIt's our friends who died, honestly. Total culture of Beirut being destroyed.\nI avoided letting myself get upset when I thought about it or was reminded of it.\nOur feelings were a drive towards what we're doing. [[Code: Response-Resilience]]\n1\nI stayed away from reminders about it.\nWe honestly dealt with it.\nPictures about it popped into my mind.\nIt's no longer about the picture. It's about the people. [[Code: Feeling-Compassion]]\nI was jumpy and easily startled (surprised).\nEspecially since during one of our operations when the second fire from the port started, we were running to escape from a potential second explosion. We ran all of us, we were with two grandpas and had to leave them in their apartment to find a cab to drive us as far away as possible from Beirut so we can at least be secure.\nI tried not to think about it.\nAt times we had to disconnect, best way to keep ourselves sane. [[Code: Response-Avoidance]]\nI was aware that I still had a lot of feelings about it, but I didn't deal with them.\nBecause some feelings started showing up in different circumstances and situations. Being upset with a team/family member because you're upset at everything.

When we see we can make a change with a single person it gives us a bit more courage, we had to always show positivity. We were all able to bring positivity to the ground as much as possible. [[Code: Positivity]] [[Code: Response-Gaining courage]] I'd say that we've been 5 years in startup journey, tougher situations personally that gave us the ability to be tougher in this period.

[[Code: Response-Resilience]]\nGot back a certain amount of invest after 7 days.\nI noticed certain times recently I'm not in control of how I'm reacting. Slowly I'm gaining my control, I allowed myself to react in any I wanted and I'm gaining my control again. No reason, just expression [[Code: Emotion-stability]]\nI actively look for ways to replace the losses I encounter in life.\nSometimes a loss is a loss. It's a part of the journey.

[[Code: Positive-Impact]] [[Code: Reprioritization]]\nI have a greater appreciation for the value of my own life.\nI've encountered loss many times before to know what it is.

[[Code: Realistic]]\nI have a better understanding of spiritual matters.\nMore complicated, maybe... How you see different spiritual organizations respond to what's happening.

And in this period it's no longer this period, it helped a lot to move stuff forward.\n1\nI established a new path for my life.\nNot a new path, new direction of the path. We're all building startups and believing in the influence of entrepreneurship over one's life - now it's the same thing, not just for yourself, you're doing it for the collective. Before this year it was lets become a billionaire and now it's about what change we can influence by being scalable and sustainable.  [[Code: Entrepreneurship-Solution to problems]] [[Code: Feeling-Compassion]]\nI have a greater sense of closeness with others.\nWith the teams/internally yes. It created a certain effect with the society. Before I was traveling so I was open to everyone. Country home, people scared from seeing other people.

If we see 20 people around us we're like oh this is a lot!\nI am more willing to express my emotions.\nSomething I learned in the country, yes, not sure I want to continue.\nAt a certain point because of the revolution, pandemic, I really believe emotions are private and need to pick who and how you want to share them. We shared willing/unwillingly. [[Code: Value-Privacy]]\nSelectiveness is always a part of my personality. It's not a value. At a certain period of time it makes you more cherish the people you're sharing the feeling with. [[Code: Value-Privacy]]\nI know better that I can handle difficulties.\nPersonally I've had more difficult times before.\nFirst time I had to quit the family business, I had to go from there to nothing. Marsielle I was happy to spend time on the streets. The moment when I left the family business to go to the private life, I felt hopeless. Then an idea burst through and I started believing in the power of ideas. [[Code: Loss]] [[Prior_Loss_Experience_True]]\nI am able to do better things with my life.\nWe really felt how people's lives have changed because of our contribution, it's priceless for us. To see how we we're able to bring positivity.\nI am better able to accept the way things work out.\nAh, not at all. Always be stubborn. [[Code: Contrarian-Thinking]]\nI can better appreciate each day.\nI was appreciating it before the blast much more. it was a responsibility not something we want to do... it's a need to do.\nNew opportunities are available which wouldn't have been otherwise.\nWe're all doing what we're doing - it's based on the effect of the blast on us. We took it in a positive way. [[Code: Positivity]]\nI have more compassion for others.\nDiscovered new people / new stories, always been the same. Sometimes with the exhaustion stories of victems and people you relate to you become a bit less compassionate. You're protecting your own energy field you can't let everything in.\nI put more effort into my relationships.\nRelationships were more stable than today. Family/Friends they were all [[Code: Positive-Peer-Inspiration]], what was your maximum problem. Succeeding/not succeeding, not living or not living - of course you have to build a deeper relationship.\n1\nI am more likely to try to change things which need changing.\nWe're doing it more right now, before we had ideas and pushed for it. Now we're acting on our beliefs.\nI discovered that I'm stronger than I thought I was.\nAt a certain point/certain event\nI learned a great deal about how wonderful people are.\nYeah, Ufff! The volunteers that are working with them. They changed their life. They change the lives of other people, especially the students.

[[Code: Positivity]] Let's say the situation now: some people are creating a way of helping and other people are doing something in nutritional food/etc. doing their work. That's a good example. Name of a project? something existing? No not really NGO called 961foods, what they do is they created something. He was thinking of traveling, he created something with a cofonuder(woman) they pack. NGOs bring food to be distributed. Yet they have an issue with logistics. They pack it very nicely in a non-costly way. They go, they know where to bring the food and they do the whole thing. Something nice that's created from a difficultly.\nI thought for Lebanon, \"just an idea person\" I didn't do anything about it. I thought there are so many - someone on Upwork contacted me from Upwork. He's in Sweden. He says, I want to create an NGO and want someone to start it with me. I told him we need something else from food. We're never like that. We don't just need food, we need to create more networks. To create opportunities with Lebanese outside. Especially opportunities distance wise. For example, something like Upwork, just for Lebanese - Lebanese people outside creating for people inside, Design /comms Lebanese abroad to Lebanese here.

I have a lot of negative people around me - my friends are always very negative around me. [[Code: Negative-Peer-Pressure]]\nMy friends are mostly negative. I need to find someone positive in my life. \"why are you different than your friends\" although sometimes I laugh, because they ask me for advice. I don't consider that I have a good career, they come to me for comfort because I think you can always at any age and any time create something from nothing if you have a good idea and are positive and consistent with it you will be successful. [[Code: Positivity]]\nWhat encouragement would you give yourself?\nso many things I want to do, I would organize myself in time slots and put everything in their own place and start something for my own and just keep going for it. - organize myself, even if it will be a total loss, it's something I will have to start.\nHow have you been coping after the blast?\nFirst of all \"time heals everything\" [[Code: Adaptation]] so everyone got a little bit back to \"normal\" after some time. Of course being with your family you feel safe again, right?[[Code: Safety]] It gives you feeling that anything could happen at anytime life is short etc. being with your family and friends, you go back to \"normal\" - until now they keep fighting you in the media, they keep showing facts, they can't find the facts, there's other stuff in the port, and they bring back the fear, and they bring back the anger, [[Code: Reappraisal]] because they re-discuss this person bring it, this party, that party, they bring back the anger not knowing - they say it was potentially an intentional act. [[Code: Political Anger]]\nDid you ever see/need to see a therepist?\nNo I didn't do. I'm one of the people who think it's a good idea to see a therapist. Especially the Lebanese have so many things going on. They go crazy they are just taking it on each other. They're shouting at each other.\nwhat do you think about that what the media is doing?\nIt's useless, they are not serving us by doing this. [[Code: Feeling-Frustration]]They are producing anger that can't turn into anything. The people are already angry from the economic issue. They don't have proof. One can sit and do theories for hours. And media their role is to have proof and bring it to the people\nDo you think there's more tension in the street than normal?\nAlready now, and maybe more and more. Because people cannot get back to the people who are doing this to them. So they are doing it to each other.  [[Code: Feeling-Frustration]]\nHow do you see that in the street?\nAny little thing they start a fight, small accident, super market, you can feel how nervous people. you can see in the faces people they are sad and angery.\n[[Post Traumatic Growth Index]] [[017 Interview]]\nPTGI_Score: 61\nPTGI_Average: 2.9\nPTGI_Appreciation of life: 12\nPTGI_Spiritual Enhancement: 2\nPTGI_Relating to others: 17\nPTGI_New Possibilities: 16\nPTGI_Personal Strength: 14\nI developed new interests.\nNot necessarily because of... yes\nI have a greater feeling of self-reliance.\nYes, I realized how important it is to be self reliant in Lebanon. //I knew// and now EVEN more.

From what we discussed about new ways to do things, for NGOs / helping people/ businesses being created / contacted by companies outside that are interested in Lebanon. Interested in Investing in Lebanon (and helping by hiring) - hiring for projects for people trying to investigate. Even have a confirmation from a friend who's creating offices, virtual offices, he told me that I was telling him I was surprised - I'm working better than ever before because people are hiring virtual offices for people working in Lebanon. Don't want to start immediately with an office and stuff. Potentially interested in being able to hire people for less / taking land for less. Opportunities for people abroad, not Lebanese abroad. It's just companies. It exists already, and what if we did a connection matching between diaspora with local projects to invest in here. Instead of other companies coming to invest in Lebanon [[Code: Silver-Linings]] [[Code: Feeling-Patriotism]] [[Code: Important]]\n1\nI put more effort into my relationships.\n(laughs), not really. \"why\"? - it didn't change, maybe it gave me another side - it gave me the contrary effect. Not giving too much into relationships with people not close to you. Maybe giving up on relationships that are not real. There are a lot of people that I lost since the corona/explosion. Since there is not much social life.  [[Code: Relationships]] [[Code: Reprioritization]]\n3\nI discovered that I'm stronger than I thought I was.\nYes in a sense of hard working,yes\nI learned a great deal about how wonderful people are.\nyes, for the solidarity that I saw.

Every one can have compassion  even people you don't expect. I was thinking of people who helped for example: I have a friend - he's in France - he has a lot of ideas. he has an NGO that helps usually the children does summer camps and brings French people with him.

[[Code: Volunteering]]\nWhat role do you see entrepreneurs having in a place like Lebanon given the current situation?\nI think the role of entrepreneurs in Lebanon is vey important important in every country and more in Lebanon because it replaces the thing in the country that the public services take so it's really it should be a thing in the middle of everything to rebuild it's the only thing that can now rebuild society lets say. in every way. from the social entrepreneurship to people providing services and products its complicated and we need them now.

More of seeing friends / seeing nature when it works.\nEasy to make time for nature?\nThere are weekends where I didn't feel they are weekends. If it's possible if I don't have tight deadlines. It becomes easy to unplug myself. If there are deadlines...\nLast weekend - was good. I had a break, this weekend it might be hard because we have a pilot. We want to prepare for it. I like to have fast projects happening because there are a lot of interested people which is good. I see the company growing and it's' good. So it's not always negative to do that (work on the weekend).\nPilot with DOT. Teach students digital skills. They used to teach them, lots of organizations brought people to center and they - it's an opportunity for them to scale. If they can do it in a remote environment they might be able to handle 2x or 3x people to take advantage of the situation online. Used to do 30 students and now they want to do 100 students. I see the future more around blended learning.\nAny time to relax on the weekend.\nDOT - telegram group - we are trying to engage people in a group. Under research. To work with underserved communities. These people are left behind. The most impact can be. [[Code: Positive-Impact]]\nDo you live with your family?\nCan you tell me about your history with entrepreneurship?\nFirst it started, as I remember. In grade. I wasn't sure how old I was - I started spending more time in the physics lab trying to understand how things work. I started exploring more of electronics and in grade 9 there was a competition to create a sort of project. A technology/innovation - I did something like a smart home. A lot of students do it. I wasn't aware of arduino, how to technically do that by taking an RC car/keyboard. Num lock light, sensor to trigger events from a program. This is how it started first.\nAt university I started the robotics club. At UNI - my roommate used to order stuff from AliExpress, if people would need any supplies they'd come to our dorm room(more like a maker space). After a while we thought more people in the university students that might be interested, we saw people come to our dorm room with interest so we thought we could start a club where we could build stuff together. We had to find 12 members and we gathered friends. Until now it's still running. It might be the first \"Startup\" I started\nStround\tI used to do freelance development projects. A two person company - not \"real UIUX\" we were young, started from there. And after that for the final year project we applied for the SPEED Accelerator to fund (ProjectName)\nI worked at Anghamy and Toters while in University. I was one of the first four developers. I was the IOs developer.I had some shares in Toters. But then when I went to (ProjectName) I returned everything back to focus on (ProjectName). I don't think my future is in a food app. I'm interested in building things and it's not my passion to work in food. So I took (ProjectName) to the SPEED accelerator. Through the robotics club we started teaching students robotics. Realized it could be done in a more interesting way. They were using the breadboard. The arduino is smart, the raspberry pi is smart, why isn't the breadboard smart? It's a valid and a very simple. Why doesn't it connect to your laptop... it's something we started on for our Final Year project, this is what we applied for in speed. These are the pins of the breadboard\nCan you tell me about your decision making process when you decided to start your own business?\nCan you tell me about how you got into Education.\nTo go back to school... I knew the education system is not good. I realized that schools didn't take into consideration what we are interested in, if I'm interested in this I'm going to spend time in this. And when I discovered this stuff my grades started getting lower but on the otherside I found something that was interesting for me. As we went through the acceleration program in SPEED, we were able to identify that this idea is not very doable. It needs a lot of... we have limitations on component sizes, we're using SMD/four layers/SMD sensors and everything, there's a limit to that. We're not able to do something something similar to the breadboard. The pin configurations will be different from that... so we zoomed out and thought, why are we doing this, to help students learn electronics - and what if the students were interested in different things? Also schools don't give them options to see / be exposed to new thing. how can we connect them to new learning opportunities that would be interesting for students. So we tried to alter the content to be more interesting for the students. We started zooming out step by step. We were trying to sell courses on ProjectName. We had a major problem. After ProjectName, our customers told us that they don't even have the ability to teach arabic/english how can you expect them to care about learning new things. There are a lot of marginalized people who aren't able to take advantage of online learning and there's a huge opportunity here\nWorking at Toters/Anghami what did you learn that might be helpful for your entrepreneurial journey.\nAy Anghami I was in touch with Eli Habib, the highest person/co-founder at the company. The work culture there I loved. The thing I learned is that a company doesn't have to be as boring as you think. Even if you are working you can even have fun/have friends. [[Code: Fun-at-work]] Anghami showed me the work culture, it surprised me; how can work culture be that fun. 2, when it comes to connection - the smallest person in the company can be connected to the co-founder - less hierarchy so it was interesting. At Toters, the founder was very focused on the numbers coming from a very big consulting firm. He was very precise and I liked that about him. Even if he spends the night at the office he had a very clear plan and was able to raise the amount he wanted to raise from investors and having a plan and following it strictly.\nEducation\nBachelors in computer engineering\n[[Ethnographic Questions]] [[018 Interview]]\nGender: Male\nAge: 27\nOrigin: Saida\nResidence: Saida\nFamily_Income_Bracket: Middle\n[[Entrepreneurial Intent Questions]] [[018 Interview]]\nEI_Score: 34\nEI_Employment_Status: Self employed\nAre you currently self-employed?\nDo you plan to be self-employed in the foreseeable future ?\nEstimate the probability (0-100%) you will start your own business in the next 5 years?\nI’m ready to do anything to be an entrepreneur\nDepends on what \"anything\" means.

To help in some way. I don't want to be a robot. If I can make some sort of a change I want to do that. Entrepreneurship gives the ability to do that. (Where do you think that interest in making a change comes from) - sometimes I do nag a lot. Bithadal ashya2 - why? Why are things like that? Why don't they change? Why do we study this, why study that? Why spend from 9-6 at work? Why choose some subjects as soon as we get to Uni? I do have a lot of questions for things that are already out there and I'm not convinced of. I like to explore or challenge can they be done in a different way. I don't take for granted that things must be done in this way. [[Code: Contrarian-Thinking]]\n(where does the idea come from that it doesn't have to happen this way?)\nwhen it comes to school days, when I was getting into electronics. I was telling my prof oh we can use USB, and do this / that. Told wait till you get to UNI to do that. So I asked why do I have to do it that way?

[[Code: Backup-plans]]\nAny reminder brought back feelings about it\nI was in the office when it happened. In Saida/not in Beirut. I heard it, it wasn't very loud because I was in Saida and I directly got videos of what happened. I was shocked. My sister and brother were in Beirut and I was worried. talked to them and they are coming back to Saida, that was good. This was the first day, making sure the family were good. near relatives doing well. Friends I talked to - I don't recall anyone close to me dying - mostly in juries, so it was fine. It wasn't \"fine\" it was better than dying. It was something you can handle (Arabic). This is when it started. After that - it was more of... what's the future of this Country\n(WHY CODE) why is this happening ... why are we living in this &*(% hole. Why is this happening. Should we look into other countries?

Mostly how can we be in another country and do what we're doing. We were trying to see other options.\nWhere do you want to have access? Does Lebanon matter?\nthe prices are nearly free when it comes to your country. Not only related to Lebanon on the personal side. If you want to make a change if you focus on a specific country it won't be that big. [[Code: Positive-Impact]]  If you can do it in your country and other countries you might be able to change the system when it comes to that. For sure the priority comes to the country - it's not the only goal. I've always thought about having something outside - something bigger to Lebanon. [[Code: Vision]] [[Code: Strategic]] (When it comes to the team, I do see we have to come to bring money into the country. We bring money into the country. It's something that helps the country - when we get big projects from outside Lebanon we can subsidize our product for small businesses.\n(does place matter?)\nthe question is where can you create the most impact? It might be a specific community? People under average, people in a certain community. This people we're targeting - doesn't matter where they are from. When it comes to a product, they might not know who's behind it / where it's from. Product has less of that story to tell to relate with when it comes to the students. This is how I see it. To add to your point, Eli Habib from Anghami exited. For us because he was in Lebanese we were able to relate to it. Someone living / operating in Lebanon was able to do that. Someone outside Lebanon. The product was for all the Arab countries.[[Code: Local-examples]]\n2\nPictures about it popped into my mind\nI didn't see what happened... I saw some videos/heard about it. Didn't live it\nI was jumpy and easily startled (surprised)\nIf this happened... what ELSE can happen in this country?!\nMy feelings about it were kind of numb (empty, neutral)\nAt first yeah..\nI had trouble falling asleep\nDid I answer that before\nI had waves of strong feelings about it\nIt's mixed feelings, so... I don't know, it's weird. Sometimes you feel you're very affected by what happened. Sometimes you feel like, whatever, let's continue living, these things happen... It's a balance between both. Now that I'm thinking about it.\nI tried to remove it from my memory.\n\"I was able to accept it.\n(what helped?)\nLike this happened, now we have to deal with it. There's nothing we can do to go back in time to make sure Beirut wasn't damaged and these people didn't die.\n(Acceptance)\ndeath of someone close to me. I do find a way to accept what happened. I was very close to my grandma, when my grandma died, i was able to accept it. SHe was very old and I knew this is where we end up.\n(is acceptance a rational process? or something else that helps you accept?)\nI believe understanding/accepting reality is very important [[Code: Realistic]] - life moves on. It's very rational to do that.\n(Does it have to do with faith/qadar?):\nTalking about religion, when it comes to Islam it comes to Submission, to submit to Allah, and I think this is how we should live.

When it comes to things we can control, you have to study 12 years... these are not set by any belief/the world.\n(Do you think the blast is something you do/do not have control over)\nWe do have control over that, if it's going to happen it's going to happen. If maybe we knew about it, maybe it's going to happen anyways. We're destined to have this. There's a saying in the quran, aqqqalal (use your brain/do something rational) watawakal - before submitting do what you have to do. DO what we should do and at the end of the day what's going to happen is going to happen. [[Code: Needing-Control]]\n1\n(you need knowledge to do something ? political?)\n90% could have handled this/averted. Something they learned in Haddiyyeh, they should have known this could have happened. They were aware of it, very large percentage had control over this, and that's mishkila min 3ndon. Something wrong from the politicians/heika\tI tried not to talk about it. Most of the one answers, these are more because I wasn't there. I just saw what happened after that.

(how did it confirm it):\nEx. for priorities, to do a change, when it happened, it was very obvious there was a clear need for a change.

Doesn't just scratch the surface of the educational system, maybe the interface needs to be reconsidered. We're solving a fundamental issue in the educational system, yet no one does anything about it about. [[Code: Entrepreneurship-Solution to problems]]\nDo you live with your family?\nCan you tell me about your history with entrepreneurship?\nNo - my entire family is in Saudi, dad has a few projects, yet he's the head of auditing. This is how we've known work/career etc. Before I graduated I had a friend who started an advertising agency and I would visit him in work. I would pitch / give my opinion. They were able to get clients because I was in the meeting. If Rawane wasn't here we wouldn't have taken this deal and we want Rawane to stay on this project. When I graduated my dad was having tough times at work. You know what I don''t know if I want to go back to Saudi. I want to start something for my family.\n[[Code: Family-Responsibility]]\nWe have an empty store in Saida, boot strapping / getting a desk and chairs.

I was making money and giving him half of everything he didn't want to make this legal and give me a share of the company. Ok khalas, I'm done. Two days later\nSo I started teaching (I had a teaching job at a well respected school in Saida) - I was realizing I was really good with students, teachers, parents - I studied psychology. When I applied I applied as a counceler, so we need you as a part time councelor and part time English. I realized I am really really good at teaching [[Code: Competence]] I can't even remember when I started learning englishI. was going through a very tough time I was depressed.\nI was diagnosed with a severe depression end of my senior year, and I was hospitalized. [[Code: Depression]] During the time when I was opening the agency - doing my BA. When I was going through school i was on meds. Halfway through the school year I decided to stop taking the meds. Even though my psychiatrist and psychologist told me not to. [[Code: Value-Self knowledge]] [[Code: Value-Independence]]\nCan you tell me about your decision making process when you decided to start your own business?\nI felt like the medicine was controlling me. I felt like it might take me a logn time but i need to take control of my own life or else I will beon those meds forever. I wanted to be free. Till the school year ended I was going through the withdrawl phase - it was worse than depression, it was such a dark period. When the school year was coming to an end, I was telling the school thank you for the experience - that's it for me. I need something challenging, I need something where I feel like I am growing. I don't want to be like those teachers doing the same thing over and over for 20 years with 0 results. [[Code: Feeling-Frustration]]\nThere are people with learning disabilities and the other teachers just call them lazy. What are you investing in students that already have skills?? [[Code: Feeling-Anger]]\nI used to volunteer [[Code: Volunteering]] at the school every friday to work with kids whose grades are below average. Although I was volunteering I knew I didn't have the skills. [[Code: Competence]] when I submitted my resignation I had a feeling that something better was coming. I applied to a learning center in Beirut. I started learning so much, working 12 hours a day [[Code: Response-Overworking]] people were recommending me to each other.\nIf Rawane isn't going to be teaching me I wont be going today. It was an elite center, they were paying 50-70 dollars. [[Code: Social-Awareness]] [[Code: Social-Awareness]]\nI knew I had skills and I had potential to do even more - to do something about the broken educational skills. What killed me was seeing the education center in Beirut for the rich people that could give top notch skills [[Code: Feeling-Compassion]] [[Code: Feeling-Sad]] and the people in Saida that weren't getting proper education at all. How do we prevent them from dropping out of school? You should still get an education, cultured, informed, aware. You should still discover and know how to explore.\nDepression relationship with Ringlet LMS\nWe started Ringlet LMS before covid 19 for a reason, the reason was personalized education. To be able to easily track the data all the for each individual. The 2 points are based on a number, You can't tell what they're suffering with. You'll know perhaps what they're suffering with and how to help, dyslexia, discalcula.... Now you know how to help - with every platform out there there is no way to evaluate the teams effectively.

Mine was more of an experience and longer and more emotions there, so definitely different than the blast.\n1\nHow did the blast affect your thinking/thinking about your projects?\nNo. If it has - definitely in a positive way. Not in a way that discouraged me. It opened my eyes on my target, where I should be focusing. We're focusing on the south region. [[Code: Silver-Linings]]\nWe have our connections barra and it's more difficult to connect to saudi, the market is bigger. \"Why the south region\" - because there's a very apparent gap, we have more than the LMS to put on the table, mindset skills, strategy, technique.

Went to Minia. There really doesn’t feel like there’s a lock down here even. My motto for the weekend is to rest up and get ready to kick the ^*&$( of the week. (laughs)\nWeek plans?\nLots going on, work work work. Two big projects we’re going to work on, more focus on the learning land program. We got a project with CLS - Center of Lebanese Studies. We’re now expanding our project to all 9 districts. We’re also working on a digital teachers program. We wanted to connect people physically, and we tried as much as possible to keep the personal connection, that’s something that people really need. We went 100% online. So far it’s going well.\nCan you tell me about your history with entrepreneurship?\nMy family, everyone has their own business, for sure, and they're all quite traditional. Although, when I was in school I had many experiences with ENJAZ Lebanon [[Code: Experience-Prior-Entrepreneurial-Training]] they joined a lot of classrooms when I was in school during grade 7, 9, 11.  I wanted to become an entrepreneur because the whole system is passive and \"I want a job\" - \"I want to be an engineer\". I don't want to be anyone else, I want to be to run my own thing that I'm completely passionate about that I purposely want to pursue and not just go with the flow.\nWhere does this entrepreneurial drive come from? What differentiated you from your classmates?\nThere are many factors. I think that I'm more self aware and that brings a lot of power to your hand and head. I think I lived through different experiences to help me reach where I am and I'm looking for more experiences to help me understand [[Code: Value-Self knowledge]]\"who is [participants name referenced I worked with different non-profits that helped me, and I went to them for help because yeah, I want to be an entrepreneur although I don't have the full set of skills that I need. I worked with a different number of them. One of the things that made me more passionate for education was a program with Teach For Lebanon, it's a program a part of a global program called Teach for All.  You go and work in an underprivileged school and you learn about how the kids are suffering and you learn about so many eye opening things. [[Code: Feeling-Compassion]] [ And the whole experience gives you the feeling, if you have an entrepreneurial mindset, you need to solve all of these problems.[[Code: Altruism]] [[Code: Value-Agency]] [[Code: Feeling-Confidence]]You can't ignore it. Actually a few of the people from the fellowship have become entrepreneurs. We were only like 2-3. I tried to talk to the CEO to talk to more civil society people to train the fellows  who are in the classrooms in entrepreneurship so they can continue. It's just two years in the fellowship. [[Code: Volunteering]] [[Code: Entrepreneurship-Solution to problems]]\nWhat experiences helped you with self awareness?\nBeing open to learning as much as you can. Whatever workshop, anything, jump in anything. And then know your niche and start to specialize.\nCan you tell me about your decision making process when you decided to start your own business?\n\nI like this question, it always starts informally. you start thinking about doing things, then you talk to people bring people together and one of the things I'm thinking about now is I really want to solve a problem in education and other people want to solve it and I think about it more. It's a bit critical, it's related to LGBTQ kids in school and no one wants to talk about it. So I catch friends, a psychologist, an activist, and we start this dialog. Sometimes we reach somewhere and sometimes we don't. It's important to have these discussions outside of work places sometimes that builds these spaces.

[[Code: Response-Socializing / relaxing]] And when you have nothing planned you have the whole day for yourself. That feels good. Maybe I'll watch a movie, maybe I'll go to nature with friends. Not do anything. When you have a full schedule for 5 days, six days a week. You get one day, which is sunday. You think, I can relax, I can finally have a free day without the calendar telling me to do this or to do that. I work two jobs, I work more than 12 hours a day. [[Code: Response-Overworking]]I am trying to go back to a normal life and one job and go back to 10 hours a day.\nWhy do you have two jobs?\n(Name of startup) - first. And then since it's been really difficult in Lebanon I found an online jobto have it as extra. [[Code: Financial]] I started it as four hours a day, and it started to get more and more and now it's taking a lot of time. And suddenly both jobs have more requirements that I'm trying to fulfill Second job a Company in the US called (name of job). It helps college students finish their degrees faster.\nProvides - I'm an online Program Manager now. It gives a lot of new insights and new ways of doing things. It's all over the world it's an online company. So we have people form India, columbia honduras usa. It feels good to interact with so many people from different places. They document every single thing they do in a clear way into SOPs - everything is documented in a clear way so if anyone leaves someone else can take their place We're bringing that learning into KidsCan so we can have more freedom, it'll be easier to hire people and keep the same quality.\nEmotionally, I want to do (Name of project) at the end since it's crazy here in Lebanon, you have to be financial stable at some point. I learned my skills by volunteering with lot of projects before. With (Name of project), you need to learn with all the challenges that can come up and have a solution for every problem. In (Name of project) there's a project that needs to happen you get the PM experience where you can imagine the steps to take, the challenges, things to think about, budget, time limit, skills of people on the team, etc. [[Code: Empowerment-Through-Learning]] [[Code: Security]] [[Code: Backup-plans]]\nDo you live with your family?\nCan you tell me about your history with entrepreneurship?\nIt didn't come from my family. Especially that I live in a rural area. They can be afraid of new ideas.  They tell us to get a job with a regular company. I take trainings with companies here and I learn a lot abou thow to do things. partner1 and partner2, a strong support system. That played a major role in us taking the risk together. (What makes you partner2/partner1 different) - I need to improve every single day, that idea makes me want to do KidsCan, take the second job. I believe it's the same idea that made me to KidsCan that made me find another job to find another. (why not get a real job)\nThis is psychology. It's from a past experience - It's made me feel like I am not good enough, so I wanted to always push myself out of my comfort zone. I need to keep going up. I don't know if that's what makes me different, the way I think. Maybe I learned french and english and I got the ability to explroe those cultures. When you explore those cultures you get new ideas than the culture you live with. Get out of the small circle that I grew up with.\n(How did you develop those ideas? )\nIt's complicated, it has a lot of stories and elements to it. I have this belief, if you want to live your life really well, be as honest as posisble. You'll know the truth, you're not having a fake experience. First it is something that has to do with my surroundings. I've seen peopel sruggle with the simplest things and they didn't kno whow to react to them. they didn't have enough knowledge. And I didn't have enough skill to transform these ideas with enough skill without being resisted without sounding different and arrogant. And it was a love story, the other part of it. That thing hit deep... I was so young, I didn't know anything about anything. The guy I fell in love with knew a lot of thigns I didn't know. The way he left I didnt' understand why that happened. I switched all of that thing to one goal... Get better. I don't know if that's completely right. I want to help people around me, I want to help people not struggle anymore. The second part, was whoa, he left you... why? I don't understand it myself. At the level of honesty where the level of honesty. [[Code: Value-Self knowledge]] [[Code: Silver-Linings]] [[Code: Loss]]\nDo you have a therepist and councelor?\nNo, I ask myself these questions myself, and my friends. I have these questions where I want to let it out there\nCan you tell me about your decision making process when you decided to start your own business?\nIt's weird, I never thought about this. I think we had the idea in mind before. I had the idea when I was in college, let's go back and do that (we finished college in Beirut and we went back to our town hasbeiyyah) We came back and noticed there are not a lot of opportunities to get a regular job. And we were in that training (entrepreneurship training, Hasbeiyyh AMIDEAST), it felt super right. There were two cohorts one in Beirut, where we knew about it and then we went to Hasbiyyah and atteneded the training there. It felt right and we didnt' think much about it at the moment. It wasnt' absed on a decision making process. It was an idea and we had a passion and we attempted to do it. It wasn't based on discussions on possible alternatives a good plan for the future. What if someone gets married and moves out. What are the plans? I think that was a mistake? We should have planned it in more depth than just jumping in. [[Code: Feeling-Joy]] [[Code: Strategic]]\nThe challenge .... is me, I got another job. I'm not giivng 100% to projectName like person1 and person2 are doing. Is it ok for me to not give 100% to projectName, did I break the agreement? (talking about it now?) Yes, there are meetings that are happening and ... I don't know. It's something that I don't want to lose their trust I don't want to make them feel that I'm not entirely committed, maybe I'm not entirely committed... the reason - things are tough and i need to get my life together. I'm trying to be as honest as possible and I'm attempting to let them be open to sharing too. I want to fight with them. Tell me! What's going on, how are you thinking about me, Tell me? We met last thursday, and I'm trying to meet with them. (why did the not look for other work?) - perhaps they didn't have the opportunity, or they [[Code: Value-Trust]]\n1\n[[Ethnographic Questions]]\nGender: Female\nAge: 25\nOrigin: Hasbaiyya\nResidence: Hasbaiyya\nFamily_Income_Bracket: Lower Middle\n[[Entrepreneurial Intent Questions]]\nEI_Score: 30\nEI_Employment_Status: Partially self employed\nDo you plan to be self-employed in the foreseeable future ?\nYes I'm planing to stay at (my project) and develop the institution where I am running things not doing the daily things\nI’m ready to do anything to be an entrepreneur\nConsidering other important aspects of my life, other than just work work work. (Other important things?) Selfcare, marriage, yeah [[Code: Value-Self knowledge]]\nMy professional goal is becoming an entrepreneur\nMy professional goal is to gain more skills, and be a better person.[[Code: Empowerment-Through-Learning]] So if that could happen through beijng an entrepreneur also being employed. So it doesn't matter chich place, my goal is to gain more skills all the time. Not styaying stuck in one place.\n(What's so important about skills) - goes back to the first idea that I need to be better every single day, not stay at a certain point? (why do you need to get better every day?) - I don't have that peace, where I feel stable now, where I can go and enjoy, there's something there that I feel pushes me to work more to be better. I don't know why.\nI will make every effort to start and run my own firm\nIf I want to start that... If I decide to start something new I'll make it happen.

I was young. For some reason, my parents did not allow us to be scared. I don't remember being so scared. I just felt safe with my family. (how did they help you not be scared) They never seemed scared to me, they always made me feel like I'm safe, I was a kid and I never felt like something bad is going to happen. It was a war and people's houses were being bombed and as a kid I felt safe because of my parents. [[Code: Safety]]\nWhat are your first memories of what happened then?\nIt was actually Dara, she texted on the group, \"guys are you ok.\" I was like what's going on, and I went to social media to find out. It was a huge shock. Like not being able to imagine. what are the things that could have actualyl happened there. At first they don't show you anything. You just see videos of things blowing up and it was a shock and it was scary since you don't knjow how bad it affected people there.\nHow were you affected by the blast?\nDefinitely you feel like - I rememeber saying that it feels like it happened inside of my house. This is my city, I lived there for years. And yeah... (pause) [[Code: Feeling-Sad]]\nDid you know people affected by the blast directly?\nNot exactly, I know aquaintances. I know people who were injured, although it didnt' affect my friends/family members.\nWhat are some of the changes in your life since the August 4th blast?\nIt's made me not in the daily review. It changed some ideas that I have. About the leadership of this country. And it's made me more convinced that we should keep on with the revolution and do everything possible to have that new people leading the country, ebcause it's ridiculous that a huge amount of that explosive material is just out there. That's not something you'd do inside your house, you wouldn't put something that would blast your house and keep it there without thinking about it. what are these people doing, what? did they not know? [[Code: Response-Political change]][[Code: Political Anger]]\nHow did the blast affect your thinking/thinking about your projects?\nPolitically. Not in the daily life, but my thinking\nYeah, definitely. We integrated it with the kids. We did a session that talked about Lebanon, their vision and their blast. We wanted to hear their thoughts and how it affected them. We thought about future sessions abou thtis, about lebabnon, express their feelings abou thteir country. their expectations, we actualyl posted that one of the girls came up and mentioned if i was president I would have build the houses of the people that were affected for free. It was beautiful to see that young girl thinking in that way, better than the leader of this country. [[Code: Ideation-Revolutionary]]\nAny reminder brought back feelings about it\nWhen the blast happened. This cloud appeared, orange cloud. Whenever I see this organge cloud again, even if it's not from the blast, I remember the blast. (when do you see orange clouds like that) the color, I remember that color and whenever the color comes out.\nI had trouble staying asleep\nThe night of the blast - I remember I was crying and I called a friend and we cried together. That was the only night that I couldn't sleep.\nI avoided letting myself get upset when I thought about it or was reminded of it\nOh, zero! I try not to suppress any feelings. [[Code: Feeling-Acceptance]]\nI felt as if it hadn't happened or wasn't real\nI digested that, I came to realize that and came to realize what are the negative effects from that.\nI was jumpy and easily startled (surprised)\nBasically because I didn't hear the blast. I wasn't there.\nI tried not to think about it\nIf the idea came to my mind I don't actively supress the idea. (how did you wind up doing this?) - I believe to make peace with the things that are happening and to digest them really well, you need to accept your feelings and you need to allow yourself to feel and think very clearly. So supressing things mean you're not dealing with it, keeping it hidden. Once you think about things and be as honest as possible with yourself, you allow that healing process to begin. This is a theory I developed and try to apply it and I think it's working. Some of the things.... i made peace with ym first love experience, I faced it all id' say...  [[Code: Feeling-Acceptance]] [[Code: Feeling-Confidence]]\nI was aware that I still had a lot of feelings about it, but I didn't deal with them\nI had feelings and dealt with them\nMy feelings about it were kind of numb (empty, neutral)\nIt hurt to see your capital city destroyed because the people in charge didn't pay attention to something like that. The amoutn of damage could have been avoided if those people were doing their job right, it's frustrating to have those poeple be the leaders of your country when you're thoughts are to make your country better to impact your community, we want to make the country better with kidscan impact parents and children. This shows the leaders don't want the country to be better, it's the oppositte. The feeling doesn't hurt anymore as it was in the beginning, it's a reality I understood.

I want to focus more about me and not my job. My personal life. (what helped inspire the reprioritization) - when I took two jobs I was in so much pressure it made me stop and think, what am  i doing. Is work worth all of that effor tand it made me think of the other aspects that I've not been taking care of so much. So yeah, it's related to the bnlast somehow, because of the blast I took the second job.... and... [[Code: Reprioritization]]\nI developed new interests.\nI started reading more. It was because of a person who reads a lot - inspired me to start reading.\nI have a greater feeling of self-reliance.\nIn response to the blast, because when I had the job online I felt I challenged the situation in Lebanon and made something happen for me in response to the bad situation here.\nI established a new path for my life.\nI'm trying\nI am more willing to express my emotions.\nI'm always willing to express my emotions\nI know better that I can handle difficulties.\nIt goes back to when a difficult situation happens and you deal with it, you feel that you can deal with the same thing again because you've understood the process. You feel more resilient. (is this happening in Lebanon now) I can't say yes/no because it depends on how each individual thinks [[Code: Response-Resilience]]\nNew opportunities are available which wouldn't have been otherwise.\nIf it didn't happen, better opportunities for he people in Lebanon are going to happen. And again, the way I reacted to that was I went out and got an online job which will pay me. Opportunity that I wouldn't have thought about it. Not sure it's the case for all people who don't speak english fluenty and can have the same opportunity. 5 for me, 3/2 for people in Lebanon [[Code: Silver-Linings]]\nI put more effort into my relationships.\nWhat changed? When I worked all the time some of my relationships were affected. especially with partner1/partner2 and I think I took that for granted, and forgot how important they are and I understand they are more important than any job, individualll and even if i want to view (project name) as a job, they are more important than (projectname) [[Code: Social-Support]]\nI am more likely to try to change things which need changing.\nIf I can change them, absolutely. If I cannot, I wont try. This is something I had to learn, is there something I can do right now that cna make the situation better. If I know the exact process, then yeah, and if I only have theories I wont attempt that anymore. It goes back to when I thought I could help people change their mind, I realize now everyone has their own thinking process. [[Code: Value-Agency]]\nI have a stronger religious faith.\nI always try to read more and devleop that.\nI discovered that I'm stronger than I thought I was.\nI feel like I taught myself to be stronger. It's not a fact that you're strong/not strong, you need to work on that. It's not something that doesn't change. It's about teaching yourself and to be flexible and adjust faster.\nI learned a great deal about how wonderful people are.\nIt's for partner1/partner2, yeah. :D\nI better accept needing others.\nIt's weird that I asnwered people are reliable lower than accept needing others. Because I can rely on others, and at the same time I have that thing I can count on my self alone. it's something I can trust others, I can have healthy relationships with others, but if that person went away, I taught myself how to function on my own. (do you think you can function without your family) - yeah - I can :) sadly - It's sad that I feel that, I feel like life makes you think/ pushes you to ... I've been through some situations where I pushed myself where I should count on myself 100% - It's sad to say, but I believe I can.

When my emotions came up I thought about how to deal with them\n[[Concluding Statements]]\nCan you tell me a little about what has been supporting you personally and professionally since the blast?\nMy friends, myself. I've been helping myself. [[Code: Value-True friends]]\nWhat role do you see entrepreneurs having in a place like Lebanon given the current situation?\nA lot to play, by entrepreneurship or something else, social work, or getting new ideas. When I took the online job, I convinced 5 other people to join the online job and now we're five. Affect community, move economy. Apply ideas to create change in the community.
