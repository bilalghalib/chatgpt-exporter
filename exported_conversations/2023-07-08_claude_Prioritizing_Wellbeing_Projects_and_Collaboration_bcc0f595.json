We will all give you a general idea but not give you a specific idea.\n\nClear articulation of what’s going on, why, where, what are we solving for. (maybe how later)\n\nBased on direction - co-woning and codirection. Not ready for that yet. Some form of leadership. Someone who has authority of direction. Someone who says ‘this is the point, this is direction” - based on that we make a year plan.\n\nWhen a person comes in after that establishment - people can start working because there is a structure.\n\nGeneral need: curriculum. Design session.\n\nCodesigning curriculum then coming back and contextualizing.\n\nKnowledge sharing: It’s now the job of each member to contextualize. This is what we designed/contextualized and share.\n\nEveryone is beautiful and nice and food is good…. What’s happening?\n\nQ. Do we need specific goals for the network? Do we need to set specific goals for the network?\n\nConcern is to add work on top of our work.

Generating specific ideas.\n\nA little bit more structure and guidance would help a lot. Towards where are we heading?\n\nIf we have ideas to share ideas to implement in wellbeing curriculum, which is the platform to enable collaboration. Open, visible, easy to use.\n\nAn element of leadership is needed to be strengthened.\n\nIt is useful to have the conversation of what people want to turnh that to clear actions.\n\nWhat is the prelog of the network? Would be nice to know the narrative from the past to build the narrative of the future.\n\nFor instance in this gathering everything that has been done has been enjoyable but sometimes missing which are the bigger purposes of things.\n\nWe need to get down to the basics; articulating the point of the network, to be able to figure out what are our goals. We could have a better onboarding plan.\n\nIf you ask people what this network is about they may be related but there are many definitions.\n\nDisciplinary or interdisciplinary outcomes of what we want to have\n\nIdeas from others and see how to apply in ones own different context\n\nOnce having clear goals we can also measure wins and losses and share them, learn from them.\n\nKnowing the end goal is critical to know how to build the path.\n\nFor new members or the ones that did not necessary drive their participation in the network its not being clear on how to see or build a clear direction. Need of understanding which is the framework/playground.\n\nHow could we reach into a stonger leadership model to show direction.\n\nHow could we come up with a blueprint for our process.\n\nTo have a resource of what people have been doing and showcase – receive feedback, other ideas.\n\nAbility to connect more and more on an individual level outside of the encounterings and forums. Projects or working groups but also ways to connect in an individual level.\n\nIt may be also a reflection of the network that the\n\nPast – small amout of institutions coming together, putting their blueprints together, editorial work of what this network may mean. Suddenly a huge growth in the network – somehow seeing what each one does and who we really are. The workgroups were built – documentation, barriors to wellbeing (commonalities and barriers), curriculum group broke up into multiple subgroups – building curriculum wide spectrum; specific to wellbeing, community; divided in to students faculty and different schools trying to find funding together. After all that we took the first day to see what was good on looking into the working groups, stage two where are we now and where do we want to head, and now trying to see what can be needed in concrete to take the next steps.\n\nBest practises and/or renaissance in higher ed with wellbeing at the core; how could we help each other to get that by convincing policy makers, presidents and funding…\n\n90 members, different levels of participation; we have 2 years to get ourselves on the track, that is the time that Wellbeing is sustaining much of the coordination.\n\nHow can this serve everyone in a way that is important.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nBuilding a clear vision and goals → robust plan of involvement\n\nSharing best practises and seeing the best way to do so – Monthly conversations and themes to work on, or dividing based on projects. This requires more organizational ledership\n\nGoals that unite, even if there can be different priorities.\n\nOnboarding plan – clarity in what is going on and how can you be part and take advantage of it\n\nFocus and dynamics\n\nCommonalities and working areas to work on\n\nDirectory of people their interests and their willing to be contacted for….\n\nThird set of notes:\n\nCircle: 8A\n\nTime: 00:00 AM\n\nTopic: Horizon 2 - What will we do in the year ahead?\n\nLeader: Name\n\nNote taker: Name\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNote:\n\nCan the definition of well-being be shared among institutions or does it depend a lot on institutions’ context?\n\nAction steps:\n\nWrite here..\n\nMapping projects\n\nThemes\n\nMethodologies\n\nTarget / Stakeholder definition\n\nImproving communication\n\nChoose the right technological tools\n\ni. Notion\n\nContinue doing spotlight moments\n\nInclude “Case clinics” – present challenges we are facing; share challenges and what went wrong (fail fest) – present context, challenge, implementation, results\n\nWorking groups presentations – pitch moment for current and new projects.\n\nInclude accountability (milestones and present results)\n\nSupport the work that the members are already doing\n\nSupport each other leveraging the work in each others institutions (e.g. convincing leadership)\n\nNetwork should help make the case – produce materials with data / impact that can be shown to the partner institution leadership\n\nSupport schools in restructure education in a way that opromotes social and emotional developmeny\n\nStructural changes are needed\n\nThe education model has to improve\n\nWhat is social change? It’s not so clear\n\nLibrary:\n\nShare the partners definitions of well-being\n\nInstitutional presentations about the well-being project and what it is doing\n\nResearch/publications (by topic)\n\nStudy cases\n\nCourses\n\nPrograms (\n\n…\n\nFourth set of notes:\n\nCircle: 6A\n\nTime: 00:00 AM\n\nTopic: What projects should we focus on as a network?\n\nLeader: Name\n\nNote taker: Ed Stevenette\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNotes/Possible projects:\n\nRound 1\n\nProject to Map the assets of members in the network => skills workshop or questionnaire to map skills / expertise / tools of members in the network to avoid duplication, maximise our efforts, and shape projects based on these assets\n\nE.g. LearningPlanet projects and events platforms were developed over many years due to needing spaces to key track of the initiatives / resources / events in communities, adapted to needs of social impact networks and institutions. Could be used by the Wellbeing network. Also experience on crowdsourcing resources / funders / policy connected to a topic : example of the gallery here.\n\nProject to design holistic Wellbeing strategy to guide institutions\n\n\\- Guidance to build the holistic strategy to improve the wellbeing in the university. E.g. Whole University Approach (has been used in the UK, early days, could be interesting to adapt this to the needs of the global education community)\n\n\\- How to impact the strategies of Director generals to bring wellbeing at the center. Elaborating the concept of holistic wellbeing so it is not just ‘another service’.\n\nProject to help students to discover and develop their vocation as a network =>\n\nE.g. Ikigai+ working group (Pep, Pascal, Claire…)\n\nProject to create regional immersion programmes e.g. members spending ¾ days at Koc University, or Oxford, or LPI… Could make this regionally focused (e.g. 3 to 4 local institutions coming together), or available for the whole network. Maximising the benefits of place-based, and feeding this into the weaving of the network. Creating a goal of some output of these exchanges.\n\nProject to document tools => If we (the network) were to die in 5 years, what are we leaving behind for the good of the planet?\n\n\\- Resources, project examples, toolkits. To make ourselves accountable to leave behind value for the world even when we might not be here in our current form\n\nExample here from AIME mentoring of why they have created a ‘death strategy’ : https://aimementoring.com/2023/01/20/the-aime-intentional-death-strategy/\n\nProject : interactive newsletter to share offers / needs\n\nhttps://superhive.is/\n\nProject to create Wellbeing certification/labelling? E.g. B-Corp for wellbeing\n\n\\- Case making for institutions to become ‘Wellbeing institutions’\n\n\\- example : Okanagan charter : https://wellbeing.ubc.ca/okanagan-charter . Focused on wellbeing within policy. Our charter could be commitment to inner development of individuals/communities?\n\n\\- Could be done in 3 days! e.g. ‘ In June 2015, UBC co-hosted the International Conference on Health Promoting Universities and Colleges at the Okanagan campus, bringing together participants from 45 countries, representing both educational institutions and health organizations, including the World Health Organization and UNESCO. Over three days, these organizations collaborated on the development of the Okanagan Charter: An International Charter for Health Promoting Universities and Colleges.’\n\nProject to share the stories and challenges institutions face in becoming wellbeing institutions\n\nE.g. Said Business School : one indicator for going high in uni rankings is salary of students post-graduation. Leads to those championing the corporate futures getting high up. Issue in the system. Important these stories are shared.\n\nWrite here..\n\nRound 2\n\n+2 for project for easy documentation of projects / tools / knowledge/ expertise, and making it easy to sift through this info based on needs. Can be also a way of building inner communities based on whoever has shared needs/projects>\n\n\\- ‘Marketing to everyone is marketing to no-one’ => Get a group of people together with a shared interest. Building from there.\n\n+1 for project building the Wellbeing project network definition of wellbeing / criteria and or core values to unite the way we do things.\n\n+1 for project sharing case studies of the local realities (makes the case for setting up regional collaborations / immersions)\n\n+1 for project to reflect on responsibility to know what we are leaving behind for future ‘generations’\n\nNEW : Project to make / connect groupings in the network based on similar backgrounds. Making sure these people discuss/collaborate as priority, and that then weaving can occur across these audience.\n\n3 groupings seem to exist in the wellbeing project. Setting up specific working sessions between members of these different groups.\n\n1\\. Pioneering institutions\n\nThose who are already living and breathing wellbeing.\n\nE.g. Mondragon University\n\n2\\. Faculty in established institutions\n\nThose advocating / running wellbeing projects/programmes/research within large institutions\n\nE.g. Member of Harvard, Stanford\n\n3\\. The network / community builders / social entrepeneurs\n\nThose advocating / connecting / leveraging wellbeing projects in the social impact space e.g. LearningPlanet\n\nAction Steps:\n\nWrite here..\n\nFifth set of notes:\n\nCircle: 2A\n\nTime: 00:00 AM\n\nTopic: Horizon 2 brainstorming\n\nLeader: Name\n\nNote taker: DMN\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSession 1: Estefania, Lene, Pascale, Yanniz, DMN\n\nSession 2: Claire, Thais, Ilke, DMN\n\nNotes:\n\nHave a shared calendar (potentially on Notion) to add events so everyone is aware what’s happening\n\nPotentially combined with\n\nSuperhive … monthly newsletter, interactive … help people become more aware about what’s upcoming, what people are working on, etc.\n\nWho: Lead: Pascal (using it in Sandbox)\n\nWhat: An auto-generated / supported tool to help improve communications in a regular basis.\n\nWhen:\n\nIntroducing it to Ale+Silvana in coming two weeks\n\nMore frequent regional gatherings … come together more locally, more often\n\nMENA\n\nWhat: … potentially align with World with Purpose conf\n\nWho:\n\nWhen:\n\nHave exchanges between institutions … of trainers / faculty / students / shadowing / mentoring\n\nWhat:\n\nMore visits … with a particular output for a visit.\n\nHave a simple list of institutions, what they need, what they can offer, etc\n\nWho:\n\nLeaders:\n\nThais can help with the organization mapping\n\nContributors:\n\nClaire\n\nIlke: Setting up a makerspace … Bilal can go hang out and do stuff there\n\nWhen:\n\nWellbeing Homes Network - who is open to hosting others?\n\nMore collaborative projects\n\n“Friendship based social change”\n\nPERMAH Revision Collaborative Project\n\nWho:\n\nLeader: DMN/Bloom (open to co-leads); who’s interested in joining?\n\nMembers: Thais\n\nWhat: Have a revised PERMAH that takes into account other things missing, issues in developing countries/marginalized communities, etc.\n\nWhen:\n\nAlign on first meeting in coming two weeks\n\nFirst revision in a month\n\nTwo months of internal testing\n\nOne month for revisions\n\nShare with Higher Ed network for additional feedback / testing\n\nPublish results! :-)\n\nBuilding the Pool of Wellbeing Facilitators in the World (Meta-project & sub-projects)\n\nWho:\n\nLeaders: Estefania, DMN, Pascal, Lene\n\nContributors: Claire\n\nWhat:\n\nProfessionalize\n\nDeprofessionalize … make much more accessible … strengthen the pool of global wellbeing facilitators\n\nDevelop/identify set of “generalized facilitation capacities” … support to develop them\n\nBuild towards certification levels, programs, etc … “open source certification” … where the certifiers need to first be certified.

(maybe how later)\n\nBased on direction - co-woning and codirection. Not ready for that yet. Some form of leadership. Someone who has authority of direction. Someone who says ‘this is the point, this is direction” - based on that we make a year plan.\n\nWhen a person comes in after that establishment - people can start working because there is a structure.\n\nGeneral need: curriculum. Design session.\n\nCodesigning curriculum then coming back and contextualizing.\n\nKnowledge sharing: It’s now the job of each member to contextualize. This is what we designed/contextualized and share.\n\nEveryone is beautiful and nice and food is good…. What’s happening?\n\nQ. Do we need specific goals for the network? Do we need to set specific goals for the network?\n\nConcern is to add work on top of our work. Set a different work plan w/different goals / priorities would people do it?\n\nO: Goal number 1, who is leadership/authority of direction. Articulate that and disseminate.\n\nWe were working in groups but largely unproductive because we were not directed.\n\nWork we’re doing already based on a direction that’s already been set.\n\nIntentionally setting results and deliverables then it could work\n\nBahare:\n\nI’m so sleepy.\n\nI didn’t get to talk to everyone here and there are more people who are not here.\n\nMake the community and give us more instruction and framework to do our own parts in it.\n\nElisa:\n\nDB to filter and search who might be interesting to talk to a mandatory spotlight on who they are and a challenge they are facing.\n\nSee the projects people are working on.\n\nBilal\n\nIf you liked someone call them.\n\nDoughnut put availability and schedule chats with people\n\nOnboarding - easier when there is clarity.\n\nFoster engagement, subcircles, regional events.\n\nBanking of talents.\n\nEstefania - nature growth? Facilitation guide for wellbeing ambassadors.\n\nIdentify existing wellbeing definitions for higher education institutions.\n\nResonate w/xy or z\n\nWorking groups, call to clarify purpose. Overarching purpose. Set expectations and milestones.\n\nMapping what we have - not constructing new things. Pep already has working group.\n\nLeave here with something we are interested in developing with other members.\n\nWhat’s working / not working .\n\nChoosing the right technology.\n\nNotion could be applied for everyone.\n\nSpotlight moments.\n\nWorking group presentations.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nWrite here..\n\nSecond set of notes:\n\nCircle: 3A\n\nTime: 00:00 AM\n\nTopic: Horizon 2 – What will we do in the year ahead\n\nLeader: Name\n\nNote taker: Kaisu\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNotes:\n\nTopics, structures topics that help us to move from Horizon 1 to Horizon 2. Generating specific ideas.\n\nA little bit more structure and guidance would help a lot. Towards where are we heading?\n\nIf we have ideas to share ideas to implement in wellbeing curriculum, which is the platform to enable collaboration. Open, visible, easy to use.\n\nAn element of leadership is needed to be strengthened.\n\nIt is useful to have the conversation of what people want to turnh that to clear actions.\n\nWhat is the prelog of the network? Would be nice to know the narrative from the past to build the narrative of the future.\n\nFor instance in this gathering everything that has been done has been enjoyable but sometimes missing which are the bigger purposes of things.\n\nWe need to get down to the basics; articulating the point of the network, to be able to figure out what are our goals. We could have a better onboarding plan.\n\nIf you ask people what this network is about they may be related but there are many definitions.\n\nDisciplinary or interdisciplinary outcomes of what we want to have\n\nIdeas from others and see how to apply in ones own different context\n\nOnce having clear goals we can also measure wins and losses and share them, learn from them.\n\nKnowing the end goal is critical to know how to build the path.\n\nFor new members or the ones that did not necessary drive their participation in the network its not being clear on how to see or build a clear direction. Need of understanding which is the framework/playground.\n\nHow could we reach into a stonger leadership model to show direction.\n\nHow could we come up with a blueprint for our process.\n\nTo have a resource of what people have been doing and showcase – receive feedback, other ideas.\n\nAbility to connect more and more on an individual level outside of the encounterings and forums. Projects or working groups but also ways to connect in an individual level.\n\nIt may be also a reflection of the network that the\n\nPast – small amout of institutions coming together, putting their blueprints together, editorial work of what this network may mean. Suddenly a huge growth in the network – somehow seeing what each one does and who we really are. The workgroups were built – documentation, barriors to wellbeing (commonalities and barriers), curriculum group broke up into multiple subgroups – building curriculum wide spectrum; specific to wellbeing, community; divided in to students faculty and different schools trying to find funding together. After all that we took the first day to see what was good on looking into the working groups, stage two where are we now and where do we want to head, and now trying to see what can be needed in concrete to take the next steps.\n\nBest practises and/or renaissance in higher ed with wellbeing at the core; how could we help each other to get that by convincing policy makers, presidents and funding…\n\n90 members, different levels of participation; we have 2 years to get ourselves on the track, that is the time that Wellbeing is sustaining much of the coordination.\n\nHow can this serve everyone in a way that is important.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nBuilding a clear vision and goals → robust plan of involvement\n\nSharing best practises and seeing the best way to do so – Monthly conversations and themes to work on, or dividing based on projects. This requires more organizational ledership\n\nGoals that unite, even if there can be different priorities.\n\nOnboarding plan – clarity in what is going on and how can you be part and take advantage of it\n\nFocus and dynamics\n\nCommonalities and working areas to work on\n\nDirectory of people their interests and their willing to be contacted for….\n\nThird set of notes:\n\nCircle: 8A\n\nTime: 00:00 AM\n\nTopic: Horizon 2 - What will we do in the year ahead?\n\nLeader: Name\n\nNote taker: Name\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNote:\n\nCan the definition of well-being be shared among institutions or does it depend a lot on institutions’ context?\n\nAction steps:\n\nWrite here..\n\nMapping projects\n\nThemes\n\nMethodologies\n\nTarget / Stakeholder definition\n\nImproving communication\n\nChoose the right technological tools\n\ni. Notion\n\nContinue doing spotlight moments\n\nInclude “Case clinics” – present challenges we are facing; share challenges and what went wrong (fail fest) – present context, challenge, implementation, results\n\nWorking groups presentations – pitch moment for current and new projects.\n\nInclude accountability (milestones and present results)\n\nSupport the work that the members are already doing\n\nSupport each other leveraging the work in each others institutions (e.g. convincing leadership)\n\nNetwork should help make the case – produce materials with data / impact that can be shown to the partner institution leadership\n\nSupport schools in restructure education in a way that opromotes social and emotional developmeny\n\nStructural changes are needed\n\nThe education model has to improve\n\nWhat is social change? It’s not so clear\n\nLibrary:\n\nShare the partners definitions of well-being\n\nInstitutional presentations about the well-being project and what it is doing\n\nResearch/publications (by topic)\n\nStudy cases\n\nCourses\n\nPrograms (\n\n…\n\nFourth set of notes:\n\nCircle: 6A\n\nTime: 00:00 AM\n\nTopic: What projects should we focus on as a network?\n\nLeader: Name\n\nNote taker: Ed Stevenette\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNotes/Possible projects:\n\nRound 1\n\nProject to Map the assets of members in the network => skills workshop or questionnaire to map skills / expertise / tools of members in the network to avoid duplication, maximise our efforts, and shape projects based on these assets\n\nE.g. LearningPlanet projects and events platforms were developed over many years due to needing spaces to key track of the initiatives / resources / events in communities, adapted to needs of social impact networks and institutions. Could be used by the Wellbeing network. Also experience on crowdsourcing resources / funders / policy connected to a topic : example of the gallery here.\n\nProject to design holistic Wellbeing strategy to guide institutions\n\n\\- Guidance to build the holistic strategy to improve the wellbeing in the university. E.g. Whole University Approach (has been used in the UK, early days, could be interesting to adapt this to the needs of the global education community)\n\n\\- How to impact the strategies of Director generals to bring wellbeing at the center. Elaborating the concept of holistic wellbeing so it is not just ‘another service’.\n\nProject to help students to discover and develop their vocation as a network =>\n\nE.g. Ikigai+ working group (Pep, Pascal, Claire…)\n\nProject to create regional immersion programmes e.g. members spending ¾ days at Koc University, or Oxford, or LPI… Could make this regionally focused (e.g. 3 to 4 local institutions coming together), or available for the whole network. Maximising the benefits of place-based, and feeding this into the weaving of the network. Creating a goal of some output of these exchanges.\n\nProject to document tools => If we (the network) were to die in 5 years, what are we leaving behind for the good of the planet?\n\n\\- Resources, project examples, toolkits. To make ourselves accountable to leave behind value for the world even when we might not be here in our current form\n\nExample here from AIME mentoring of why they have created a ‘death strategy’ : https://aimementoring.com/2023/01/20/the-aime-intentional-death-strategy/\n\nProject : interactive newsletter to share offers / needs\n\nhttps://superhive.is/\n\nProject to create Wellbeing certification/labelling? E.g. B-Corp for wellbeing\n\n\\- Case making for institutions to become ‘Wellbeing institutions’\n\n\\- example : Okanagan charter : https://wellbeing.ubc.ca/okanagan-charter . Focused on wellbeing within policy. Our charter could be commitment to inner development of individuals/communities?\n\n\\- Could be done in 3 days! e.g. ‘ In June 2015, UBC co-hosted the International Conference on Health Promoting Universities and Colleges at the Okanagan campus, bringing together participants from 45 countries, representing both educational institutions and health organizations, including the World Health Organization and UNESCO. Over three days, these organizations collaborated on the development of the Okanagan Charter: An International Charter for Health Promoting Universities and Colleges.’\n\nProject to share the stories and challenges institutions face in becoming wellbeing institutions\n\nE.g. Said Business School : one indicator for going high in uni rankings is salary of students post-graduation. Leads to those championing the corporate futures getting high up. Issue in the system. Important these stories are shared.\n\nWrite here..\n\nRound 2\n\n+2 for project for easy documentation of projects / tools / knowledge/ expertise, and making it easy to sift through this info based on needs. Can be also a way of building inner communities based on whoever has shared needs/projects>\n\n\\- ‘Marketing to everyone is marketing to no-one’ => Get a group of people together with a shared interest. Building from there.\n\n+1 for project building the Wellbeing project network definition of wellbeing / criteria and or core values to unite the way we do things.\n\n+1 for project sharing case studies of the local realities (makes the case for setting up regional collaborations / immersions)\n\n+1 for project to reflect on responsibility to know what we are leaving behind for future ‘generations’\n\nNEW : Project to make / connect groupings in the network based on similar backgrounds. Making sure these people discuss/collaborate as priority, and that then weaving can occur across these audience.\n\n3 groupings seem to exist in the wellbeing project. Setting up specific working sessions between members of these different groups.\n\n1\\. Pioneering institutions\n\nThose who are already living and breathing wellbeing.\n\nE.g. Mondragon University\n\n2\\. Faculty in established institutions\n\nThose advocating / running wellbeing projects/programmes/research within large institutions\n\nE.g. Member of Harvard, Stanford\n\n3\\. The network / community builders / social entrepeneurs\n\nThose advocating / connecting / leveraging wellbeing projects in the social impact space e.g. LearningPlanet\n\nAction Steps:\n\nWrite here..\n\nFifth set of notes:\n\nCircle: 2A\n\nTime: 00:00 AM\n\nTopic: Horizon 2 brainstorming\n\nLeader: Name\n\nNote taker: DMN\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSession 1: Estefania, Lene, Pascale, Yanniz, DMN\n\nSession 2: Claire, Thais, Ilke, DMN\n\nNotes:\n\nHave a shared calendar (potentially on Notion) to add events so everyone is aware what’s happening\n\nPotentially combined with\n\nSuperhive … monthly newsletter, interactive … help people become more aware about what’s upcoming, what people are working on, etc.\n\nWho: Lead: Pascal (using it in Sandbox)\n\nWhat: An auto-generated / supported tool to help improve communications in a regular basis.\n\nWhen:\n\nIntroducing it to Ale+Silvana in coming two weeks\n\nMore frequent regional gatherings … come together more locally, more often\n\nMENA\n\nWhat: … potentially align with World with Purpose conf\n\nWho:\n\nWhen:\n\nHave exchanges between institutions … of trainers / faculty / students / shadowing / mentoring\n\nWhat:\n\nMore visits … with a particular output for a visit.\n\nHave a simple list of institutions, what they need, what they can offer, etc\n\nWho:\n\nLeaders:\n\nThais can help with the organization mapping\n\nContributors:\n\nClaire\n\nIlke: Setting up a makerspace … Bilal can go hang out and do stuff there\n\nWhen:\n\nWellbeing Homes Network - who is open to hosting others?\n\nMore collaborative projects\n\n“Friendship based social change”\n\nPERMAH Revision Collaborative Project\n\nWho:\n\nLeader: DMN/Bloom (open to co-leads); who’s interested in joining?\n\nMembers: Thais\n\nWhat: Have a revised PERMAH that takes into account other things missing, issues in developing countries/marginalized communities, etc.\n\nWhen:\n\nAlign on first meeting in coming two weeks\n\nFirst revision in a month\n\nTwo months of internal testing\n\nOne month for revisions\n\nShare with Higher Ed network for additional feedback / testing\n\nPublish results! :-)\n\nBuilding the Pool of Wellbeing Facilitators in the World (Meta-project & sub-projects)\n\nWho:\n\nLeaders: Estefania, DMN, Pascal, Lene\n\nContributors: Claire\n\nWhat:\n\nProfessionalize\n\nDeprofessionalize … make much more accessible … strengthen the pool of global wellbeing facilitators\n\nDevelop/identify set of “generalized facilitation capacities” … support to develop them\n\nBuild towards certification levels, programs, etc … “open source certification” … where the certifiers need to first be certified.
