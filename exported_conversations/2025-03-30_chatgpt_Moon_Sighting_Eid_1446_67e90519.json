However, this announcement faced scrutiny from UK experts who questioned the possibility of sighting the Shawwal crescent on that date, citing astronomical calculations and the occurrence of a solar eclipse that day. citeturn0search1\n\n- **United Kingdom**: The New Crescent Society indicated that the 29th day of Ramadan would be on Sunday, March 30, with the crescent moon expected to be easily visible. Consequently, many in the UK, along with communities following Morocco and South Africa, planned to celebrate Eid on Monday, March 31. This approach contrasts with groups adhering to Saudi Arabia's declaration, leading to differing Eid dates within the UK. citeturn0search1\n\n- **North America**: The Central Hilal Committee of North America reported that the moon was not sighted on Saturday, March 29, 2025. As a result, they declared that Ramadan would complete 30 days, with Eid al-Fitr observed on Monday, March 31, 2025. citeturn0search7\n\n- **Pakistan**: The Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) forecasted that the Shawwal crescent would likely be visible on March 30, suggesting Eid al-Fitr on March 31. They noted minimal chances of moon sighting on March 29 due to the moon's age and positioning. The final decision rested with Pakistan's Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee, which was scheduled to convene on March 30 to assess moon sighting reports. citeturn0search5\n\nThese variations underscore the complexities and regional differences in moon sighting practices, influenced by local observations, astronomical calculations, and differing criteria for determining the Islamic calendar. ",

      "content": "Great question — it touches both fiqh (Islamic legal rulings) and community ethics/spirituality.\n\n### **What is the ruling on fasting the day of Eid?**\n\n**Fasting on Eid al-Fitr is *haram* (prohibited)** by unanimous consensus among scholars of all four madhhabs (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi‘i, Hanbali). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) explicitly prohibited fasting on the two Eids:\n\n> \"The Prophet forbade fasting on the two days: the day of Fitr and the day of sacrifice (Adha).\"  \n> — *Sahih Bukhari* and *Sahih Muslim*\n\nSo, **you must not fast on the day of Eid** — even if you missed a day in Ramadan or were uncertain about the moon sighting.\n\n---\n\n### **What if I believe the moon was not sighted and it’s actually still Ramadan?**\n\nThis is where it gets nuanced:\n\n- **If a person fasted 29 days of Ramadan, and a legitimate local moon-sighting committee (e.g., Central Hilal Committee in the US) declares Eid**, then *you are expected to break your fast with the community*, trusting the collective ijtihad (reasoned judgment).\n  \n- **If someone genuinely believes Eid was declared prematurely** (i.e., it’s still Ramadan), scholars advise:\n  - If the **community consensus** is strong and unified, **you should not fast** and instead follow the Eid prayer and celebration.\n  - Privately fasting that day is **not permitted** even if you personally disagree with the sighting — *unless* you live completely disconnected from any community.\n\n> The **unity of the community takes precedence**, especially when it comes to communal acts like Eid. The harm of division is greater than the potential error in moon sighting.\n\n---\n\n### **Spiritual considerations**\n\n- **Eid is meant to be a day of joy, gratitude, and togetherness**.\n- The Prophet (peace be upon him) encouraged eating **before the Eid prayer** on Eid al-Fitr — to emphasize it is not a fasting day.\n  - He used to eat **an odd number of dates** before going to Eid prayer (*Sahih Bukhari*).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n| **Consideration**         | **Ruling / Best Practice**                                 |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fasting on Eid           | Prohibited (haram) by scholarly consensus                   |\n| If unsure about moon     | Follow local, trusted committee and do not fast             |\n| Unity vs. Personal Opinion | Unity and community outweigh individual moon-sighting views |\n| Sunnah on Eid morning    | Eat before Eid prayer (odd number of dates recommended)     |\n\nWould you like a short summary to share with your community or friends?",
