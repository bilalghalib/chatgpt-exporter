      "content": "Hey, so I have a question about my tax obligations. So I have a contract with a company in Lebanon that is paying me to a bank in America and I live in France. Do I need to report my money that I get from a Lebanese business to an American bank here in France? I pay taxes on it in America as someone who lives outside the country. So very minimal taxes because I only need to pay state taxes. What do you know about this?",

      "content": "It sounds like you have a complex international tax situation. Generally, if you're a resident of France, you're likely subject to French tax laws on your worldwide income. This includes money you earn from foreign sources, like your contract with a Lebanese company. However, tax laws can be intricate and vary based on individual circumstances.\n\nSince you're already paying taxes in the U.S., there might be tax treaties or foreign tax credits available to avoid double taxation. It's important to consider these to understand your full tax obligation in France.\n\nI recommend consulting with a tax professional who is knowledgeable in international tax law, especially regarding U.S.-France tax matters. They can provide specific advice based on your situation, ensuring compliance with all relevant tax laws and treaties. \n\nDo you have any more specific questions about this, or perhaps another topic you're curious about?",

      "content": "In the United States, banks are required to report certain transactions to the IRS. This includes large transactions and suspicious activities that might indicate money laundering or tax evasion. However, not every transaction is automatically reported.\n\nFor your specific situation:\n\n1. **Gifts:** Generally, receiving a gift of $5,000 is not taxable for you as the recipient. In the U.S., the obligation to report a gift and potentially pay gift tax falls on the giver, not the receiver. However, there are some exceptions and nuances, especially with gifts from foreign sources.\n\n2. **Bank Reporting:** Banks report to the IRS when transactions meet certain criteria, like if you deposit more than $10,000 in cash. Smaller transactions, like your $5,000 gift, typically wouldn't be automatically reported unless they're part of a pattern that raises flags for money laundering or other financial crimes.\n\n3. **Account Reporting:** If you have foreign bank accounts, you might need to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) with the U.S. government if the aggregate value of your foreign accounts exceeds $10,000 at any point in the year. This is separate from your tax return and is more about financial transparency.\n\n4. **Audit Risk:** Being audited can happen for various reasons, and having foreign income or accounts can increase your risk. However, a $5,000 deposit by itself is unlikely to trigger an audit unless there are other factors at play.\n\nSince tax laws are complex and can change, it's wise to consult with a tax professional for personalized advice. They can help ensure you're compliant with all relevant laws and reporting requirements. \n\nDo you have any more questions, maybe about a different aspect of international banking or taxes?",

      "content": "Banks in the United States do not typically report the total amount of transactions in an account to the IRS for the purpose of taxation. Here's how it generally works:\n\n1. **Interest Income Reporting:** Banks report interest income you earn on your accounts if it's above a certain threshold (usually $10). This is done using Form 1099-INT, which you and the IRS both receive.\n\n2. **Large Transaction Reporting:** Banks also report certain large transactions, particularly cash transactions over $10,000, due to regulations aimed at preventing money laundering. This is separate from income reporting.\n\n3. **Your Responsibility:** As for your total transactions or account balances, it's generally not something banks report to the IRS. It's your responsibility to report your income accurately on your tax returns, including any interest earned from bank accounts. \n\n4. **FBAR and FATCA:** If you have foreign bank accounts, you may need to report them under the Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) regulations if the total exceeds $10,000 at any time during the year. Additionally, under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), certain foreign financial institutions report the holdings of U.S. taxpayers to the IRS. These are more about account balances, not the total amount of transactions.\n\nIn your case, the bank wouldn't report the total amount of transactions, but you're responsible for reporting any income, like interest, and complying with FBAR and FATCA if applicable.\n\nIf you're unsure about what needs to be reported, it's a good idea to consult with a tax professional. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.\n\nDo you have any other concerns or questions, perhaps about something else related to banking or finance?",

The document should be recent, usually within the last three months.\n\n3. **Residence Permit or Visa:** If you're not an EU citizen, you'll likely need to show your residence permit or visa.\n\n4. **Proof of Employment or Income:** Some banks may require proof of employment or income, like a payslip or an employment contract.\n\n5. **Initial Deposit:** Many banks require an initial deposit to open an account, though the amount can vary.\n\n6. **Application Form:** You'll need to fill out an application form, either in person at a branch or online, depending on the bank.\n\nEach bank may have slightly different requirements or processes, so it's a good idea to check with a few banks to find one that suits your needs. Also, if you're not fluent in French, looking for a bank with English-speaking staff or online services in English can be helpful.\n\nDo you need more information on this, or is there something else you're curious about?",

Here's what to consider:\n\n1. **Digital Banks:** Revolut, Wise, and similar platforms offer many of the functions of a traditional bank, like holding money, making payments, and transferring funds internationally. They often have simpler application processes and can be set up online without needing a French address or residence card.\n\n2. **Documentation:** For digital banks, you'll typically need some form of ID (like a passport) and possibly proof of address, but they might be more flexible with documentation compared to traditional banks.\n\n3. **Expired Residence Card:** Using an expired Titre de séjour for any financial application can be tricky. It’s best to check with the specific bank or service. Digital banks might be more lenient, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n4. **Limitations:** While digital banking services are very convenient, they might have limitations compared to traditional banks, like deposit insurance limits, fewer in-person services, or different fee structures.\n\n5. **Renewing Your Titre de Séjour:** It's advisable to get your residence card renewed as soon as possible, as it's a crucial document for many aspects of life in France, including banking.\n\nGiven your situation, starting with a digital bank might be a good interim solution while you wait for your residence card renewal. Once you have your renewed Titre de séjour, you can always open a traditional bank account if needed.\n\nDo you need any more guidance on this, or perhaps have another question in mind?",

      "content": "When it comes to opening a bank account in France as an American, there are several factors to consider. From the perspectives shared by expats and Americans living in France, it's clear that both traditional French banks and digital banking options like TransferWise have their merits.\n\nFor traditional banks, BNP Paribas is often mentioned as a favorable choice for Americans. It has a presence in the U.S., which can make the process more seamless for U.S. citizens. Société Générale and Crédit Agricole are also commonly recommended for their services tailored to international clients【22†source】【23†source】.\n\nAn important aspect to remember is that while opening a bank account in France, you will likely encounter the need to present various documents, such as proof of identity, proof of address in France, and proof of legal status. This could include a long-stay visa or a Carte de Séjour. Also, be prepared for bank fees, which can vary greatly depending on the type of account and the services required【23†source】【24†source】.\n\nDigital banking solutions like TransferWise (now known as Wise) are praised for their ease of use, especially for international transactions. They offer low fees for sending and receiving money internationally and the convenience of managing multiple currencies. Opening an account with these digital platforms is usually straightforward, with minimal fees compared to traditional banks. However, they might lack some of the comprehensive services offered by traditional banks【24†source】.\n\nIn summary, the choice between a traditional French bank and a digital bank like Wise depends on your specific banking needs, the level of convenience you're looking for, and the range of services you require. Traditional banks offer a broader range of services but may come with higher fees and more complex documentation requirements. Digital banks provide ease and efficiency, especially for international transactions, but may have limitations in terms of services. \n\nRemember, the process can be challenging, so it's advised to shop around, be well-organized with your documents, and be prepared for different banks' varying requirements and responses.",

      "content": "Opening a bank account online with BNP Paribas in France is generally geared towards residents. Traditional banks in France, including BNP Paribas, typically allow residents to open accounts online. However, there are usually specific requirements to be met. For residents, these might include providing a passport, residence permit, proof of address, and possibly proof of employment or educational enrollment if you're a student【44†source】.\n\nBNP Paribas offers both current and savings accounts, as well as online banking options. They are known for their young person’s account, providing discounts on fees and services for those aged 18-24. It's important to note that while BNP Paribas operates globally, some services may be more limited in certain countries, and you might need to be a French resident to access some products and services【43†source】.\n\nFor non-residents, the process can be more challenging. Traditional banks may have more restrictions for non-residents, like higher minimum deposits and subscription fees. Online banks, such as N26 and Revolut, can be a more convenient option for non-residents, as they often don't require proof of income, address, or minimum deposits, and there are no subscription fees. International banks like HSBC and Deutsche Bank also offer relatively simple processes for non-residents【44†source】.\n\nThe cost of opening a bank account in France varies by bank. BNP Paribas, for example, offers a discount for students and young adults. Generally, you can expect to pay between €2.00 and €5.00 per month for the subscription and a one-off fee of €40 to €150 for extra benefits like credit cards. If you're a non-resident, banks might ask for a minimum deposit to open an account, which can vary significantly【44†source】.\n\nIt's important to directly check with BNP Paribas for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding their account opening processes, especially if you're interested in opening an account online as a non-resident. Each individual’s circumstances can affect the availability and process of opening an account.",

This could involve attending career fairs, preparing for interviews, or acquiring new skills【52†source】.\n\n5. **Seek Guidance:** A career counselor or mentor can provide invaluable assistance and insights. They can help refine your career plan and provide accountability【52†source】.\n\n6. **Keep Reviewing and Updating:** Regularly revisit and adjust your career plan to ensure it remains relevant and aligns with your evolving aspirations and circumstances【52†source】.\n\nRemember, career planning is a dynamic process, and it's important to remain flexible and open to new opportunities as they arise.

Your involvement in projects like GEMSI (Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative) and Bloom (formerly Pitchworthy) has established a solid foundation in community building, social entrepreneurship, and fostering innovation in challenging environments.\n\nGiven your background, experience, and the new phase of life with the arrival of your baby, here are some potential next steps and career considerations:\n\n1. **Leveraging Your Experience in Social Enterprises:** With your extensive background in social entrepreneurship, particularly in the MENA region, you could explore consultant roles in international development organizations or NGOs. Your skills in setting up and running initiatives like Bloom, which focuses on entrepreneurship education and support, can be invaluable in advisory or strategic roles in similar organizations or even in larger, global NGOs that align with your values and expertise【58†source】【60†source】.\n\n2. **Expanding into Education and Training:** Your experience in developing and facilitating programs like Bloom and GEMSI can translate well into roles in educational institutions or organizations focusing on entrepreneurial education and development. This could include designing curricula, leading training programs, or even teaching roles that focus on entrepreneurship, social innovation, and community development.\n\n3. **Remote Work and Digital Platforms:** With the growing trend of remote work, especially post-COVID-19, your skills in running virtual accelerator programs could open opportunities in global remote work platforms. You could look into roles that involve managing remote teams, developing digital platforms for social impact, or even roles in startups that focus on digital education and remote work solutions.\n\n4. **Consulting and Freelancing:** Given your diverse skills and experiences, consulting could offer a flexible option. This could involve working with startups, social enterprises, or even larger companies looking to develop corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives or social entrepreneurship programs.\n\n5. **Writing and Thought Leadership:** Your journey and experiences provide a rich source for writing and thought leadership. This could involve writing articles, blogs, or even a book about your experiences in social entrepreneurship, innovation in the MENA region, and insights on creating impactful social change.\n\nAs you consider these options, remember to balance your career aspirations with your new responsibilities as a parent. Flexibility and work-life balance might be more crucial than ever.\n\nUltimately, your next steps should align with your passion for social change, innovation, and entrepreneurship, while also providing the stability and flexibility you need in this new chapter of your life.",

Building a robust professional network is crucial.\n\n3. **Education and Specialization:** If you haven't already, consider pursuing further education or certifications relevant to your area of expertise. For example, courses in conflict management, international organization management, or leadership in nonprofit organizations can be beneficial.\n\n4. **Showcase Your Skills Online:** Create a strong online presence. Share articles, insights, and your experiences on social media platforms. This will help in establishing your authority in the field and make you more visible to potential employers or clients.\n\n5. **Apply Proactively:** For roles in organizations like the UN, it's essential to actively apply for positions through their official portals like Inspira.

So, you know, when I was in high school, I always was an outsider and so I felt like I needed to do everything on my own and do my own things and started a design business because I loved to draw and then that design business turned into Modati Studios, M-O-D-A-T-I. You might still be able to find us online and see. I loved being able to sell my creativity and also we made t-shirts and work with musicians and bands. I wound up setting up a place called The Alibi, which is a concert hall and then from there I wound up going to California because I'm a big nerd and I made a 3D laser cutter out of scanner parts and you can search $50 laser cutter and find me on Instructables. I got an internship in California, engaged with a bunch of Silicon Valley startup people, got infected with that culture, began to spread hacker and maker and DIY and entrepreneurship culture internationally. After the Arab Spring, I felt like I was an Arab and I'm Iraqi and I wanted to participate in changing the world, but I got disillusioned and I also have PTSD from my time in Iraq and seeing people die and be killed and I'm beginning to discredit the whole neoliberal approach at entrepreneurship solving everything and I have read Winner's Take All, this book that shows how it's a charade for fancy rich people to stay fancy and rich while pretending to be good and I'm seeing the world getting more and more difficult and I feel like if I want to be relevant I should go back directly to entrepreneurship, work on alternative energy projects, clean water projects and start another business rather than talk about it and support others even though initially I thought it would be better to support others because that's my strategy. I want to inspire many many people to be thinking about how to make the world better instead of being one person who works on making the world better, except the space for me to do that has been really limited and I haven't really been seeing much impact and so I'm beginning to think about changing everything and also I'm getting kind of jaded and frustrated and sad and I had a baby and I just wind up foraging all day and beginning to think maybe I should just take care of nature, find products in nature, make little watercolor boxes and sell them on another one of my businesses called New World Creative Studios and have the cleanest most pure money possible because it's really spirituality, the beauty of nature and to forget all of this arrogant bs of me taking over and creating big powerful change and focusing more on having a more close relationship with my wife, my baby, nature and God and just be more gentle on the earth and not think I can make a big impact. That's what I'm thinking.",

Starting from a design business to engaging in the maker culture, working in Silicon Valley, and then shifting towards social entrepreneurship in the MENA region post-Arab Spring, your path shows a continuous evolution driven by personal values and experiences.\n\nYour disillusionment with certain aspects of neoliberal entrepreneurship and the desire for a more direct, impactful approach is understandable, especially given your experiences and reflections on global issues. The idea of returning to entrepreneurship with a focus on critical areas like alternative energy and clean water is compelling and aligns with your skills and passion for making a tangible impact.\n\nThe notion of moving towards a simpler, nature-focused lifestyle, emphasizing spirituality, family, and environmental stewardship, presents a shift towards inner peace and personal fulfillment. This aligns with your desire for purity and simplicity in your work and life.\n\nBoth paths have their merits. One focuses on leveraging your entrepreneurial skills for direct impact, while the other emphasizes personal well-being and a sustainable lifestyle. It's about finding a balance that fulfills your need for impact, personal well-being, and alignment with your core values. This might involve blending both approaches – creating a business that aligns with your environmental and spiritual values while maintaining a strong connection with your family and nature.\n\nYour diverse experiences have equipped you with unique skills and perspectives.

Part of me feels like I'm just wanting to go small with this whole nature of spirituality thing and curl up into a ball rather than a choice that comes from real, you know, vision. Although it's hard to say that 100% because I do find it really beautiful. And also, I feel like it's so much of the impulse to create positive changes, all this arrogant posturing, and I just really want to stay far away from that. I want to make sure that I'm doing things gently and kindly and beautifully. And the thing is, my dad wants me to join his company to do water treatment purification. And he just recently told me that he wishes that he spent less time working and more time taking care of us and hanging out with the kids. But that project is still in its early phases. And if I join, I worry that I'll not be able to hold myself back and be like a French person working 9 to 5 and not thinking about work after 5 p.m. and before 9 a.m. and really sending you boundaries because I have ADD and I'm an all-in or all-out kind of person, as I'm sure you can tell from my background and history and diverse interests. I also like making things with my hands. I'm a horrible time manager and I can't manage people. I'm very pushover. I'm a very flexible person. So what kind of role can I possibly do in an early-stage startup that requires someone to be hard-lined and working with governments and smooth-talking and de-essing and being able to hire people and fire people? I'm not sure I'm ready and capable to do that. What's a good role for me? I'm more strategic and visionary and thinker. And in a new business, that person is not really a great fit for some, especially if they want to take so much time off and breaks. Is it possible to do this new water treatment project, water engineering technologies, you can check it out online and move it into Dubai and Saudi and UAE and Iraq and work in these very corrupt places, keeping my peace and calm and gentle attitude without hustling, working only four days a week and only seven hours or six hours a day?

Your strengths lie in strategic thinking and visionary ideas, which are valuable in any startup, but you also express concerns about the demanding nature of such a role, especially in challenging environments like Dubai, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iraq.\n\nGiven your preferences and self-awareness about your work style and personal traits, a role that allows you to contribute your strategic insights without being deeply involved in day-to-day operations could be suitable. This might involve being an advisor or a board member, where you can influence the direction of the project without the stress of managing it.\n\nWorking in a startup, especially in a field like water treatment that has significant potential for impact, can be demanding. Yet, it's not uncommon for startups to adopt flexible work models. It's possible to negotiate a work arrangement that aligns with your desire to work limited hours while contributing meaningfully. The key would be clear communication about your role, expectations, and boundaries from the outset.\n\nYour passion for making things with your hands and your interest in a more nature-connected, spiritual lifestyle suggest that finding or creating a role that blends these elements could be fulfilling. This might look like focusing on product development or R&D within the water treatment project, where you can innovate and create without the pressures of management.\n\nIt's also important to consider that your role and contributions can evolve as the company grows. Starting with a specific, well-defined role that suits your current needs doesn't preclude you from taking on different responsibilities in the future, as you and the company develop.\n\nRemember, the right role for you is one that aligns with your values, leverages your strengths, and respects your personal boundaries.",

Is it a thing that is possible to do? Are there ways of making going slow better for everybody, including the planet, and creating these water technologies that make a positive impact on purification of contaminated outflows into rivers?

This can take some pressure off you as a CEO and also lead to more innovative solutions.\n\n4. **Implement Flexible Work Practices:** Emphasize work-life balance and flexibility. This approach can enhance productivity and well-being for the whole team.\n\n5. **Set Clear Boundaries:** Make it clear what you can and can't do, and stick to these boundaries. This will help manage expectations and allow you to work in a way that suits your strengths and limitations.\n\nAs a CEO, your primary role is to ensure the company's success and sustainability, and this can be achieved in various ways, not just through a traditional, high-pressure approach.

Leadership can be effective in various forms, and what works for one company or leader might not be suitable for another. You can create a culture where empathy, work-life balance, and well-being are prioritized. This involves:\n\n- Setting a tone of respect and understanding for your team's personal lives and stages.\n- Encouraging a work environment where efficiency is valued over long hours.\n- Leading by example in terms of balancing work and personal life.\n- Hiring and empowering competent team leaders who can be more hands-on, allowing you to focus on strategy and vision.\n\nSuch an approach can foster a sustainable, positive work environment, where employees feel valued and motivated, potentially leading to better long-term results for the company.",

And so Josephine, my wife, is looking forward to having me have about $1,500 coming in starting in March. And so I wonder if I should focus on Noor Creative Studios or Noor Co-op, which is my business selling essential oils and perfumes and crafts online, which has its own track record, has thousands of purchases and hundreds and hundreds of five-star reviews, and I can turn that into a small business that I like, that's cute, that's small and beautiful, that I feel joyful in doing, or if I should try to step into this role, or if I should do both, or if I should even do all three, where I open myself up for some consulting, I work on this water treatment project, and I also work on Noor Creative Studios stuff and turn them all on. I mean, Elon Musk is on six boards, but how can I possibly do that and still manage my headspace to be present with my kids? I think the most difficult thing is, how do I turn my head off from work and focus on family? Because I'm such a work-oriented person, as you can see from my track record, I've worked my whole life really hard all the time, and I only think about projects. And if I don't turn my kid into a project, I'm worried that he'll get forgotten in the pile of things that I need to do for all of the other things that I want to do, that I care about. And so maybe I need to find a project that's related to children and kids and age-appropriate, so that he gets incorporated into my life in a deep way. And then, you know, maybe you have one day a week doing all these different things. And also, I'm not even working in France. I need all of this work to be remote. Is it possible? What would you see? What do you think? Put all the pieces together. Think about me. Think about how you have heard me talking to you, and think about what you would advise me as if you were an elder, a wise person, someone who lived a life and is trying to tell me to look back and say, you used God's gifts, and I know that God gave me a brain that can be creative and put pieces together. And I have lightning, alternative energy, inspiration, and I like technology, but I like humanity. I'm spiritual. I want to be small. I want to do business differently. I want to think about money differently. I want to think about all of these things as a way of showing leadership in the world through my projects, so that the world can be more beautiful. All is a service to the divine. And I want to know how I can live this life where I know that I take care of my baby, my wife, and also I want to help my dad, because I know my dad wants help, and I have been refusing to help him, kind of being an American, wanting to stake it out on my own. But now I'm seeing him older, and I love his projects, love the water stuff, so I wonder if I can actually step in and be kind to my dad and support him in this project, but I don't want it to take over my life where I become my dad and don't work so much that I don't actually have any time for my baby.",

Focusing on it could provide the financial stability Josephine is looking for while aligning with your values.\n\n2. **Project Involvement:** Consider a strategic, less time-intensive role in your father’s water treatment project. This could involve advisory work or specific project-based contributions, allowing you to support your father without overwhelming commitment.\n\n3. **Remote Work and Flexibility:** Given your need for remote work and flexible hours, ensure any role you take aligns with these requirements. Consulting could fit this, as it often allows control over your schedule and work environment.\n\n4. **Family Integration:** Explore ways to integrate family life into your work. This could mean choosing projects related to children or creating a workspace that allows you to be near your family while working.\n\n5. **Mindful Work-Life Balance:** Practice setting clear boundaries between work and family time. This might involve dedicated work hours and family hours, ensuring you remain present for both aspects of your life.\n\n6. **Spiritual Alignment:** Seek projects that align with your spiritual values and desire to contribute positively to the world. This alignment can provide deeper satisfaction and purpose in your work.\n\nRemember, it's about finding a balance that satisfies your professional goals, personal values, and family needs. You might not be able to do everything simultaneously, and that's okay. Prioritize what's most important to you at this stage of your life and adjust as needed.",

However, the intense focus on work led to less time with family, a trade-off that weighed on you.\n\nPath 2: **The Artistic Creator**\nHere, you focused on Noor Creative Studios.

While challenging, you established a structured routine that balanced work and family.

      "content": "Finding interns for your dad's Water Engineering Technologies project in Iraq or Turkey, especially in December, is indeed feasible. Here are some approaches based on the resources available:\n\n1. **In Iraq:** Considering the opportunities listed on platforms like Bayt.com, there are several internships available in Baghdad across various fields, including remote internships in areas like marketing, project management, and IT. These opportunities indicate an active internship market in Iraq, and similar platforms could be used to find interns who are interested in water engineering and related fields【123†source】.\n\n2. **In Turkey:** Job portals like Glassdoor list a variety of internship opportunities in Turkey. These range across different industries and include positions at major companies like Mercedes-Benz and Procter & Gamble. This suggests a dynamic internship environment in Turkey as well【122†source】.\n\nFor your project, you can post internship opportunities on these platforms specifying the skills and roles you're looking for. Given the nature of your project, focusing on areas like environmental engineering, business development, or marketing could be beneficial. To attract the right candidates, clearly outline the project's goals, the learning opportunities, and any potential for future employment or involvement in a significant, impactful project.\n\nGiven the early stages of the project and the current lack of funding for salaries, you could emphasize the valuable experience and potential future opportunities that come with being part of a groundbreaking project from its inception. Additionally, highlighting any unique aspects of the project, such as its potential environmental impact or innovative approach, can make the opportunity more attractive to potential interns.\n\nTo manage these new roles and the project's development effectively, especially considering your and your dad's time constraints, it's important to be clear about the expectations and responsibilities for each role. This clarity will help interns understand their contribution and align their work with the project's goals. \n\nIn summary, leveraging online job platforms and internship listings in both Iraq and Turkey can be a viable way to find the right candidates. Emphasizing the unique aspects of your project and the potential for impactful work can attract motivated interns, even in a situation where immediate financial compensation might not be available.",

This should include an introduction to the project, its goals, and the specific roles and responsibilities of each intern. Having a written guide or manual can be very helpful.\n\n2. **Set Clear Expectations:** Clearly outline what you expect from the interns in terms of deliverables, deadlines, and communication. Be honest about your management style and your challenges with time management.\n\n3. **Use Project Management Tools:** Tools like Trello, Asana, or Monday.com can help organize tasks and deadlines. These tools are user-friendly and can help keep track of what needs to be done, by whom, and by when.\n\n4. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular meetings (weekly or bi-weekly) to check in on progress, address any concerns, and provide guidance. This can help keep the interns on track and engaged with the project.\n\n5. **Delegate Responsibility:** If possible, appoint a lead intern or a more experienced intern who can help manage day-to-day tasks and serve as a point of contact for other interns.\n\n6. **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a system for regular feedback, both giving and receiving. This can help in adjusting the management style and project direction as needed.\n\n7. **Professional Development:** Offer opportunities for the interns to learn and grow professionally, such as workshops, training sessions, or mentorship. This can increase their engagement and commitment to the project.\n\n8. **Flexibility:** Given your work style, being flexible with how and when work gets done (as long as deadlines are met) might be beneficial. \n\nRemember, effective management isn't about being pushy; it's about clear communication, organization, and mutual respect. Utilizing these strategies can help create a productive and positive environment for both you and the interns.",

I love public speaking. I am a great public speaker. I enjoy it greatly. I just am not very good at telling lies, and I am very factual, and I am a narrative storyteller, not a BS-er.

      "content": "Working in challenging environments like the Middle East, especially where corruption might be more prevalent, and maintaining integrity is indeed possible, though it may come with its unique set of challenges. Here are some strategies and perspectives:\n\n1. **Leverage Your Strengths in Public Speaking and Storytelling:** Use your skills in narrative storytelling to create compelling, factual presentations about your technology. Genuine enthusiasm and belief in your product can be very persuasive.\n\n2. **Focus on Building Relationships:** In many cultures, business is as much about relationships as it is about the product or service. Build trust and rapport with potential clients and partners through consistent, honest communication and by demonstrating your commitment to ethical practices.\n\n3. **Emphasize the Value and Quality of Your Product:** Highlight how your technology or service can benefit the client and their community. If your product is superior, let its merits speak for themselves.\n\n4. **Network with Like-minded Individuals and Organizations:** Seek out businesses, NGOs, and other entities that have a reputation for clean operations. Collaborations with such entities can enhance your credibility and help in navigating the business landscape.\n\n5. **Consult with Experts:** Consider working with local business consultants or legal advisors who understand the nuances of doing business in these regions and can guide you on how to proceed while maintaining integrity.\n\n6. **Utilizing ADD to Your Advantage:** People with ADD often excel in dynamic, fast-paced environments. They can be highly creative, able to think outside the box, and are often great at problem-solving. These traits can be advantageous in managing interns, where flexibility and innovation are key.\n\n7. **Adaptability and Resilience:** Your ability to adapt to different situations and your resilience can be a major asset. Use these qualities to navigate the complex business environments and changing market dynamics.\n\nRemember, being ethical doesn't necessarily limit your success; it might sometimes slow down the process, but it builds long-term, sustainable relationships and a strong reputation. Success in business, particularly in challenging environments, is often about patience, persistence, and staying true to your values.",
