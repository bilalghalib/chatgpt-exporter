            "extracted_content": "Okay, so I want to work on my bloom.pm assessment framework. We want to rethink what we're assessing for our teams. We currently have an enterprise capacity assessment test that we call the ECAT, the e-cat, and we have the Measurement of Flourishing from the School of Positive Psychology, P-E-R-M-A-H, the PERMA score, and then we have one that's based on the United European Union's enterprise competencies called Entrecomp, and we're trying to do all these assessments and we're trying to get them pre-post, and so I need you to kind of interrogate me and grill me. I want to be able to think in a structured way about, like, which assessments, why are we taking these assessments, what purposes do they serve, why should we do pre-post. You know, we run an accelerator program. There's a boot camp phase where people are just curious, and we onboard them onto these Zoom calls, telling them, giving them some information. Then we have a sprint phase where they work with us deeply for two weeks, and then we have a entrepreneur development accelerator phase, which goes for about three months, where they have mentorship and more regular one-on-ones and follow-ups, and I'm wondering, you know, first let's think clearly and coherently about what we're doing and how to, like, reassess the assessments and what we want to do with them, and maybe first you can just ask me some questions to help me map out what are possible directions to take all of these assessments and figure out, should we add more assessments, should we reduce assessments, what are the assessments doing, what are the goals of the assessments, and what do we want to do with this information, how do we deal with the data, and all that. So maybe you can ask me, you know, first, like, reiterate what I've said, maybe look into our context window, look into our history, talking about, you know, how we used assessments for our research in the past, and see if you can come up with a way of framing this conversation right now.\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s what I understand about your situation:\n\nYou’re running a multi-phase accelerator program through Bloom.pm with distinct phases: a boot camp (onboarding, curiosity-driven), a sprint phase (intensive two-week collaboration), and an entrepreneur development accelerator phase (three months of mentorship and regular engagement).\n\nYou currently use three assessments:\n\nECAT (Enterprise Capacity Assessment Test) – Bloom’s own framework for evaluating enterprise readiness or competencies.\nPERMAH (Measurement of Flourishing) – From the School of Positive Psychology, evaluating well-being and psychological flourishing.\nEntreComp (European Union's framework) – Measuring entrepreneurial competencies.\nYou’re administering these assessments pre- and post-program and are now rethinking their purpose, utility, and how they align with the goals of your program. You want to explore whether these assessments are sufficient, whether they overlap, and how their data serves participants and Bloom as an organization.\n\nSome questions to help us map and interrogate this:\nPurpose and Goals of Assessments\nWhat are you trying to measure?\n\nAre you assessing individual growth, team dynamics, enterprise readiness, or something else?\nDo you want to measure objective business outcomes (e.g., revenue, customers) or subjective changes (e.g., confidence, resilience)?\nWhat outcomes matter most for Bloom?\n\nAre you trying to justify program impact to stakeholders (e.g., funders, partners)?\nAre you using the data to improve the program, coach participants, or create a research output?\nWhy pre- and post-?\n\nIs the goal to track the effectiveness of the program?\nDo participants see their own results, and does that help them reflect or grow?\nHow does each assessment align with your goals?\n\nDoes ECAT give you actionable insights about enterprise capacity?\nDoes PERMAH reflect something vital to entrepreneurial success, or is it more about personal well-being?\nIs EntreComp being used as a benchmark for entrepreneurial competencies in a global context?\nData Management and Analysis\nWhat do you do with the data?\n\nHow is the data analyzed, visualized, and shared (internally or externally)?\nAre there trends you’re consistently finding, or is the data noisy?\nDo participants receive personalized feedback from their results?\nHow do you ensure the data is meaningful?\n\nDo participants take assessments seriously?\nAre there concerns about biases, or how people interpret the questions?\nWhat gaps exist in your current assessments?\n\nAre there critical dimensions of growth you’re not measuring? For example:\nResilience in failure\nDecision-making under uncertainty\nRelationship/network-building skills\nWould new assessments provide value, or would they overload participants?\nProcess and Experience for Participants\nWhat is the participant experience with assessments?\n\nAre participants engaged and reflective, or do they view the assessments as a chore?\nHow much time do these assessments take, and do they interrupt their focus on entrepreneurship?\nWhen and how are assessments delivered?\n\nAre pre- and post-assessments enough, or do you need mid-point check-ins?\nShould assessments be spaced differently during the phases (e.g., at sprint vs. accelerator)?\nPotential Changes or Innovations\nHow might the assessments evolve?\n\nCould you integrate real-time feedback loops during the accelerator?\nCould assessments help participants track and celebrate their growth as a motivational tool?\nWhat’s missing?\n\nShould you consider qualitative methods (e.g., interviews or journaling) in addition to quantitative assessments?\nAre there frameworks you’re curious about that could add value (e.g., grit, emotional intelligence)?\nYour Prior Experience\nLooking at the past:\n\nIn your previous research (e.g., post-traumatic growth, flourishing, and well-being with Beirut entrepreneurs), what worked well in your assessment strategy?\nDid you notice any disconnect between the data collected and the story it told about the participants?\nLearning from failure:\n\nHave you faced challenges with past assessments?\nAre there cases where the data didn’t reflect reality or participant experiences?\nZooming Out\nBig-picture questions:\nIf you could only keep one assessment, which one would you keep and why?\nIf you could design an entirely new framework for Bloom, what would it measure and why?\nHow do these assessments align with Bloom’s mission to foster flourishing and well-doing?\nNext Steps\nDo any of these resonate? Would you like to dive into specific assessments, clarify your goals, or brainstorm innovations for what these assessments could do?\n\n11:18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWe're measuring personal and professional growth, and we're trying to find ways that they connect and lead to something that kind of shows that they both positively reinforce each other. And we want to measure objective business outcomes and confidence and resilience. Like, we want to do it all. Yeah, we want to show that the program has had impact and maybe sort of prove this hypothesis that working on resilience and well-being and flourishing for entrepreneurs is both already a success and it is a precursor to further entrepreneurial success as well. It's a hypothesis, but it's also what we want to see happen. And yes, we're using the data to improve the program and using the data to coach participants, and we're using it to create research output. The problem with pre-post right now is that we have something, you know, the Dunning-Kruger effect, where we have people that take the assessments and then learn more, and then because of that, they realize that they didn't know so much and they actually score worse the second time in the post. And so it doesn't really help show our program in the best light, and we want to figure out how to, like, address that. Like, how can we do something else so that we don't have that effect kind of make us look like people get worse throughout the course of our program instead of, you know, the idea that the Dunning-Kruger effect is actually a marker of learning. Yes, participants take the assessments, and then on our platform, they can actually see the results and then find activities in our library related to their results so that they can continue to grow. And yeah, so they do have the ability to see their results and interact with them. It's not just for us. We want to make sure that everything for the teams is, you know, is for the teams as well as for us, as well as the program partners and research, like, isn't just abstract. It's actually useful for everybody. ECAT gives us actionable insights as to where the teams can even spend some of the grant money from the accelerator. So we actually use it as one of the core benchmarks for what they want to learn and do during the course of these three months. So it's actually one of the kind of critical assessments that we use for the actions that they take. PERMA reflects this hope that we are helping people grow personally and professionally and that through their work, they're not just burning themselves out in social impact as a social enterprise. And so we want to make sure that we are measuring that, having conversations about that, and so on. Entrecomp is used, you know, kind of as part of wanting to align to global frameworks. And then also it's a competency. It's not something that is an individual competency compared to the ECAT that kind of is an organizational capacity. So the organizational capacity is a little different. Like the person and their capacity for, you know, kind of taking action or accessing resources, you know, working with others, learning through experience, self-awareness. That's all very personal. It's a little different than the kind of stuff that the well-being assessment will take. You know, the well-being assessment will take things. It's sort of, you know, like soft skills is another way that you can think of the Entrecomp. But we don't like that language of soft skills, so we just call them universal skills. So this is like universal skills. It's the personal growth element, but it doesn't include the well-being stuff. And so we're trying to do things around, you know, what does the business need, what does the person need, and how can they develop these competencies that are going to help them both in the business and in life. And that's what the Entrecomp helps us do. And then, yeah, so we use these assessments, especially the ECAT during the course of the program, and we actually use it to kind of, you know, assess where people are, where they're going. And we use the well-being to have conversations about, you know, wellness and the PERMA and the Entrecomp. We're still finding better ways of integrating that into the program. It's like right now currently just awareness, and we're trying to connect activities in our library with all the Entrecomp elements so that once they take an assessment, they actually can go into our library and find things to do. But we do need to make it more actionable, I guess. The data trends are, yeah, actually, there are some assessments that we don't do in the past that I have been finding really, you know, insightful for analysis, and that's the School of Positive Psychology's character strengths profile. It was another way of doing some of this, like, inner work stuff and related to, I guess, what we're now using PERMA for, you know? PERMA kind of shows about well-being and entrepreneurial capacities. Oh, sorry. Character strengths actually are also correlated with that, so we were using it as a way to, like, help people know themselves and then be able to identify, you know, ways of bringing that character strength to life during the course of the program. But we don't use it anymore in exchange for these partially because the assessment is kind of really long, the character strengths assessment, and nobody other than one of the founders knew how to really operate and hold space for it. And so I think it would be good to bring it back, but it's now mostly being taken care of by the PERMA assessment. But the previous data and interesting insights was related to the character strength, showing, you know, which character strengths kind of correlate with entrepreneurial success and which character strengths were supportive of resilience. Yeah, so gaps in the assessment is like we don't actually use all the data that we get, the well-being one in particular and the Entreprise Entrecomp one as well. It's too many bits of information and it's too much for people to take all the assessments pre-post. And so mostly what we do right now is we take the pre of the ECAT and then post we ask them, like, where they thought they grew, but we don't have a full post. Participants take assessments on their own on the computer. I think they think it's a chore. They can take an hour if you do all of them all together. We try not to make it an interruption on their entrepreneurship, and so we try to make it actually really useful, but it's a little bit hard to ensure that, you know, especially when it's early in the program, they still don't actually know what we're doing yet. Yeah, that's one of the things I was thinking about in terms of real-time feedback is instead of taking the assessment just in the beginning, could we actually take the assessment in the beginning and then over the course of the program, we could have, you know, moments. Let's talk about, like, well-being. We could say that, you know, we have a PERMA hangout every Sunday for people to gather and talk about that, and we can kind of take a snapshot and kind of update the data without having to take a whole other assessment. Yeah, I think we could bring in some more qualitative methods. That might be good, but that just sounds like more work, so what are things that we can do to kind of simplify and streamline? Keep one assessment. I guess we would just do the ECAT because it's the one that's most integrated operational. New framework. It would be everything. It would be maybe coming alive, and, you know, we see how it relates to the downstream stuff, but it's, like, the most internal, the most central that the other stuff emerges from."

            "extracted_content": "I feel like we need to learn about these:\n\"The concept you're referring to is often linked to the idea that \"simpler models\" can outperform more complex ones under certain conditions. This is closely related to Occam's Razor, the bias-variance tradeoff, and principles from information theory. One well-known result in this area is that reducing the number of variables can help avoid overfitting and lead to models that generalize better to new data. Here are a few key ideas and research findings that align with what you're describing:\n\n1. The Bias-Variance Tradeoff\nThis concept explains why simpler models (with fewer variables) sometimes perform better. The tradeoff is that:\n\nHigh bias models (simpler models) make stronger assumptions about the data and might underfit.\nHigh variance models (complex models with many variables) can overfit to noise in the training data, failing to generalize well.\nA model that is too complex might capture noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern, leading to poor performance on new data.\n\n2. Occam's Razor and Model Simplicity\nOccam's Razor is the principle that \"simpler explanations are more likely to be correct.\" In machine learning, this often means that models with fewer parameters are favored because they tend to be more robust and less prone to overfitting.\n3. Regularization Techniques\nRegularization methods (like Lasso and Ridge regression) deliberately penalize complexity by reducing the impact of less significant variables. Research has shown that regularization often improves model performance by effectively reducing the number of variables, leading to simpler models that generalize better.\n4. James-Stein Estimator\nThe James-Stein estimator is a famous result in statistics that demonstrates that, under certain conditions, shrinkage estimators (which \"shrink\" coefficients toward zero) can perform better than the usual maximum likelihood estimators. This idea aligns with the notion that reducing the complexity of the model (by reducing the impact of less important variables) can lead to more accurate predictions.\n5. Information Theory: Minimum Description Length (MDL) Principle\nThe MDL principle suggests that the best explanation of data is the one that leads to the smallest combined length of the description of the data and the model. In practical terms, it often leads to selecting simpler models with fewer variables.\n6. \"The Blessing of Dimensionality\" in High-Dimensional Data\nSome studies in machine learning and statistics indicate that in certain high-dimensional settings, reducing the dimensionality (or the number of variables) can actually lead to better performance. This is sometimes referred to as \"the blessing of dimensionality,\" which is a counterpoint to the \"curse of dimensionality.\" The idea is that too many dimensions can create noise and make it harder for models to identify meaningful patterns.\nIf you're looking for specific papers or sources, I can help you track down more precise references. Alternatively, if any of these ideas sound familiar, I could narrow down the search for you!\n\n\n2/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nit was also something about linear, working with doctors and ensuring that htey can do the calculations with paper and pencil\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAh, it sounds like you're referring to the idea of using simple linear models or approaches that are interpretable and practical, especially in fields like medicine, where clinicians need to make decisions quickly and effectively, often without the aid of complex tools. This aligns with research advocating for simplicity in predictive models, particularly when users need to trust and understand the model.\n\nHere are some key aspects and potential research that might align with what you read:\n\n1. Linear Models in Medicine\nPaul Meehl's Work (1954): In Clinical vs. Statistical Prediction, Meehl argued that simple, linear statistical models often outperform clinicians' intuition in predictive tasks. His work showed that even basic models using a few well-chosen variables could rival or outperform complex, subjective judgments.\n2. Interpretable AI and Simplicity\nInterpretability in AI and Medicine: A common principle in medical decision-making is that predictive models should be interpretable and actionable. For example:\nA linear regression model with just a handful of variables can provide accurate predictions while remaining simple enough for clinicians to calculate or approximate without advanced tools.\nResearch has shown that even if complex machine learning models (like neural networks) are slightly more accurate, practitioners may prefer linear models because they are easier to understand and trust.\n3. Parsimony and Performance\n\"The Parsimony Principle\" in Healthcare Models: Studies show that reducing the number of variables to just the most important ones can often result in models that:\nAre easier for clinicians to use (e.g., on paper or with basic tools).\nPerform comparably or better because they avoid overfitting and reduce noise.\nOne famous example is the APACHE Score (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) used in intensive care units. It uses a manageable number of variables to predict mortality risk, balancing accuracy and usability.\n\n4. Evidence Supporting Simpler Models\nA study by G. Gigerenzer and others on \"fast-and-frugal heuristics\" shows that simple decision-making rules, using only a few key variables, can perform just as well as more complex methods in many real-world situations, including medicine.\n\nResearch in Risk Scores: Tools like the CHADS2 score (used for stroke risk in atrial fibrillation) or the TIMI risk score (used for heart attack risk) are intentionally simple and based on linear models so clinicians can use them without technology. These tools demonstrate how fewer variables and simple calculations can be clinically effective.\n\n5. Focus on Linear Models\nIn healthcare research, linear models are often favored for their:\nEase of use: Clinicians can compute them manually or with simple tools.\nTransparency: It’s easier to explain why a model produces a specific prediction.\nRobustness: Linear relationships are often good approximations for medical outcomes, where small variations in complex models may not add value.\nDoes this sound like what you were reading about? If you'd like, I can help track down papers or articles on interpretable models in healthcare or provide examples of such tools in practice!\"\n\n1 it's creating a coaching program that's validated and measuring the few right things while also offering a map to participants. I feel like we need to do two things: 1) offer people a framing to understand/accept that entrepreneurship is not all team building and fundraising, and involves soft skills and wellbeing - AND measuring the right things that can help us guide our program, and ensure that the participants build the capacity to see the framing, develop awareness of framing, self, business, agency to operationalize that awareness, and have acess to resources, mentors/funding to enact upon that awareness. I think this is sort of a key insight here. \n2. i think the most critical measure might be flourishing, progression the people indicate towards their ECAT development insights and gap filling (maybe we measure that - as peopel go, where are you on xyz element. What did you do, maybe we can progressively add naunce to that ECAT element with each time we run the program, they may open a new nuance that counts as progression - just like you can find an infinity between any two numbers, or a dewey decimile system can add new elements, I feel like people can be able to add their own elements and we should sort of emphaisize and prioritize this.\n3. I think we can streamline assessments... "

The paste.txt document actually provides a fascinating parallel - just as reducing variables can help avoid overfitting in statistical models, maybe reducing assessment complexity could help you focus on what really matters.\n\nLet me propose a framework based on your three key insights:\n\n1. Framing + Measurement Integration\nInstead of treating well-being/soft skills and business metrics as separate tracks, what if the ECAT became your \"backbone\" assessment that incorporates elements of well-being and universal competencies? Think of it like a tree:\n- Root system (well-being/PERMAH elements)\n- Trunk (core business capacities)\n- Branches (specific competencies)\n\n2. Progressive Depth Model\nRather than pre-post testing, what if you used what I'll call a \"deepening\" model:\n- Initial ECAT assessment provides baseline\n- Throughout the program, participants add layers of understanding to each element\n- Like your infinity between numbers metaphor, each element could become progressively more nuanced\n- This accounts for the Dunning-Kruger effect by expecting and celebrating deeper understanding\n\nHere's a question: What if instead of measuring \"improvement,\" you measured \"depth of understanding\" in each area? This might better capture the actual growth happening.\n\n3. Streamlined Integration\nFor the operational side:\n- Keep ECAT as core framework\n- Weekly \"depth check-ins\" during mentorship (5-10 minutes)\n- Monthly reflection sessions (like your Sunday PERMAH idea)\n- Use qualitative data from these touchpoints to enrich quantitative baseline\n\nWould something like this address your core needs while simplifying the assessment burden?

            "text": " Let me build on your response while incorporating the insights from that pasted text about simpler models and assessment frameworks.\n\nWhat I'm hearing is that, similar to how medical professionals need simple, actionable measurements they can do with pen and paper, you're looking to create something that's both meaningful and manageable. The paste.txt document actually provides a fascinating parallel - just as reducing variables can help avoid overfitting in statistical models, maybe reducing assessment complexity could help you focus on what really matters.\n\nLet me propose a framework based on your three key insights:\n\n1. Framing + Measurement Integration\nInstead of treating well-being/soft skills and business metrics as separate tracks, what if the ECAT became your \"backbone\" assessment that incorporates elements of well-being and universal competencies? Think of it like a tree:\n- Root system (well-being/PERMAH elements)\n- Trunk (core business capacities)\n- Branches (specific competencies)\n\n2. Progressive Depth Model\nRather than pre-post testing, what if you used what I'll call a \"deepening\" model:\n- Initial ECAT assessment provides baseline\n- Throughout the program, participants add layers of understanding to each element\n- Like your infinity between numbers metaphor, each element could become progressively more nuanced\n- This accounts for the Dunning-Kruger effect by expecting and celebrating deeper understanding\n\nHere's a question: What if instead of measuring \"improvement,\" you measured \"depth of understanding\" in each area? This might better capture the actual growth happening.\n\n3. Streamlined Integration\nFor the operational side:\n- Keep ECAT as core framework\n- Weekly \"depth check-ins\" during mentorship (5-10 minutes)\n- Monthly reflection sessions (like your Sunday PERMAH idea)\n- Use qualitative data from these touchpoints to enrich quantitative baseline\n\nWould something like this address your core needs while simplifying the assessment burden? The key would be making sure each measurement serves multiple purposes - like how doctors choose vital signs that tell multiple stories about health.\n\nWhat aspects of this resonate with you?

Let me outline my critiques and then pose some questions:\n\nCritiques:\n1. Measurement Standardization: How do we ensure consistent measurement across different mentors and programs? The subjective nature of 'aha moments' and 'growth patterns' could make it difficult to compare results across cohorts.\n\n2. Investor Alignment: Most investors want to see concrete metrics. While personal growth is valuable, we need clear connections to business outcomes.\n\n3. Training Complexity: Teaching other accelerators to implement this system requires them to shift their entire paradigm of assessment. That's a big ask.\n\n4. Resource Intensity: Tracking individual growth journeys at this level of detail could require significant mentor time and expertise.\n\n5. Validation Challenge: Without traditional pre/post measurements, how do we validate program effectiveness to stakeholders?\n\nKey Questions for You:\n\n1. Standardization: How would you create a rubric or guide that allows different mentors/accelerators to consistently assess 'garden health indicators' without losing the nuance of individual journeys?\n\n2. ROI Connection: Can you map specific 'garden health indicators' to traditional business success metrics? For example, how does improved 'soil quality' translate to measurable business outcomes?\n\n3. Training Framework: What would a \"train the trainer\" program look like for this methodology? How long would it take to get another accelerator up to speed?\n\n4. Resource Allocation: How much additional time/resources would accelerators need to implement this compared to traditional assessment methods? Can you quantify the difference?\n\n5. Evidence Building: Without traditional pre/post assessments, how do you propose building an evidence base that demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach to stakeholders like funders and partner organizations?\n\nWould you like to address any of these concerns first, or should we dive deeper into one of the specific questions?\"\n\nThis framing presents both the structured critique and opens the door for constructive dialogue about implementation. Which aspect would you like to address first?",

            "text": "\n\nSpeaking as Steve Chase, Program Manager of TechGrowth Accelerator:\n\n\"While I appreciate the holistic approach of the 'garden' framework, I have several concerns about its practical implementation and scalability. Let me outline my critiques and then pose some questions:\n\nCritiques:\n1. Measurement Standardization: How do we ensure consistent measurement across different mentors and programs? The subjective nature of 'aha moments' and 'growth patterns' could make it difficult to compare results across cohorts.\n\n2. Investor Alignment: Most investors want to see concrete metrics. While personal growth is valuable, we need clear connections to business outcomes.\n\n3. Training Complexity: Teaching other accelerators to implement this system requires them to shift their entire paradigm of assessment. That's a big ask.\n\n4. Resource Intensity: Tracking individual growth journeys at this level of detail could require significant mentor time and expertise.\n\n5. Validation Challenge: Without traditional pre/post measurements, how do we validate program effectiveness to stakeholders?\n\nKey Questions for You:\n\n1. Standardization: How would you create a rubric or guide that allows different mentors/accelerators to consistently assess 'garden health indicators' without losing the nuance of individual journeys?\n\n2. ROI Connection: Can you map specific 'garden health indicators' to traditional business success metrics? For example, how does improved 'soil quality' translate to measurable business outcomes?\n\n3. Training Framework: What would a \"train the trainer\" program look like for this methodology? How long would it take to get another accelerator up to speed?\n\n4. Resource Allocation: How much additional time/resources would accelerators need to implement this compared to traditional assessment methods? Can you quantify the difference?\n\n5. Evidence Building: Without traditional pre/post assessments, how do you propose building an evidence base that demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach to stakeholders like funders and partner organizations?\n\nWould you like to address any of these concerns first, or should we dive deeper into one of the specific questions?\"\n\nThis framing presents both the structured critique and opens the door for constructive dialogue about implementation. Which aspect would you like to address first?",

We created it to help accelerators and program managers focus on impact and inclusive entrepreneurship in developing/emerging ecosystems through skill-based and character-based support. \nHow to use this step-by-step guide?\nRunning accelerator programs is a young and evolving field. With limited proven research into best practices, we do not wish to claim a set formula or one-size-fits-all approach. Accelerator models vary significantly depending on their objectives. \nInstead, the guide aims to help program managers understand some of the critical choices and challenges they'll need to consider if they're considering building a program of their own. It combines lessons from previous practices and patterns we identified over the years to highlight and frame the strategic choices facing stakeholders interested in creating and running these programs. \nWe developed this guide into two sections:\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻\nThis section will help you understand our framework and assessment suite.\nSection 2: Running an Accelerator Program 🌟\nThis section covers the critical aspects of creating and running an accelerator in six simple stages. Each stage comes with a series of toolkits to help you think about your plans and the context of accelerator design.\n\n\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻 \nAlso here: Bloom Framework v0.9 - Two Pillars (draft)\nBloom's Training Framework offers a dynamic, adaptive learning environment for individuals, teams, and organizations through a guided project-based and cohort-based learning approach. It focuses on two core pillars:\nThe Individual: Featuring Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH), Universal Skills, Character Strengths, and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessments.\nThe Organization: Featuring the Organizational Development Assessment.\nThe framework helps assess core strengths and weaknesses, prioritizing areas for learning and development. Our goal is to simplify the creation of custom learning journeys, enabling teams and program managers to identify optimal learning opportunities, foster a supportive environment, and positively impact businesses.\nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for improvement across both pillars, ensuring simultaneous development and, for example, improving an individual's skill through activities that address core organizational needs.\nEntrepreneurs identify their priority development areas based on assessment results and customize their learning journey with program managers, co-creating a tailored curriculum for the cohort.\nOur framework is based on proven cohort-based and project-based learning methods combined with the power of mentorship. Peer learning enhances the experience, while project-based learning aligns objectives with a mission or vision, fostering intrinsic motivation. Using a flipped classroom approach, entrepreneurs first digest relevant content, reflect on their learnings, and apply them in their enterprises. They then meet with their cohort for peer feedback and mentorship, using what they learn in real-life settings.\nOur programs nurture individual and organizational development, promoting cooperation over competition and leveraging collective intelligence to solve pressing societal problems.\nThe Bloom Training Framework is versatile and can be used in various contexts, including companies, educational programs (youth, school, university), startup accelerators, and short events like startup sprints or hackathons.\n\nOur Principles\nWe use the following guiding principles to evaluate and prioritize program activities:\nKeep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat. (Upside down pyramid) \\/\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the teams in our programs to help them do the right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on extraneous, nonaligned activities. We want to keep the teams and participants in the driver's seat and help them develop decision-making skills. We can help people develop skills of effectiveness by creating an enabling environment. \nTransformation > Information. Make available knowledge actionable. (Library content)  \nPrioritizing transformative learning experiences over mere information dissemination ensures that knowledge is applied in meaningful ways. By providing actionable insights and practical tools, we create an environment where learning translates into real-world impact.\nGet the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessments)\nOptimizing team composition by aligning individual strengths and roles enhances overall team effectiveness. Through comprehensive assessments, we identify key areas for personal and professional growth, enabling targeted interventions that maximize individual and collective potential.\nWhy integrate individual growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team is determined by the development of each individual who comprises it. So, while personal development and well-being are also an end, we ensure that the teams are more robust and the organization is more likely to keep going. Instilling such resilience helps cultivate values-driven people and a community of social change makers with a growth mindset and a contributor attitude. \nCreate an enabling environment in the program and support the broader ecosystem.\nFostering a supportive community within cohort-based programs is essential for creating an enabling environment where entrepreneurs can thrive. By nurturing a culture of collaboration and mutual support, we enhance the learning experience and contribute to the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem. We win when we win together. \n\nPillar 1: The Individual\nBloom recommends the following individual development assessments:\nWellbeing & Engagement: at work & in life (through PERMAH)\nEntrepreneurship & Leadership Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of entrepreneurship and leadership \nCharacter Strengths: through VIA, Values in Action \nUniversal Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of work and life)\n 1.1. Wellbeing & Engagement \nOur Wellbeing and Engagement assessment is rooted in the principles of positive psychology and aims to measure human flourishing. This assessment evaluates six critical dimensions. These dimensions are essential indicators of a well-lived life, each contributing uniquely to an individual's overall sense of wellbeing.\nPositivity: Measures the extent to which an individual experiences positive emotions, crucial for enhancing resilience and overall mental health.\nEngagement: Assesses the level of involvement and absorption in activities, reflecting a flow state where individuals are fully immersed and find deep satisfaction.\nRelationships: Evaluates the quality of an individual's connections with others, recognizing that supportive and fulfilling relationships are fundamental to wellbeing.\nMeaning: Gauges the sense of purpose and direction in life, indicating how much individuals feel their lives have significance and contribute to something greater.\nAchievement: Measures the accomplishment of goals and the sense of mastery, highlighting the importance of setting and achieving personal and professional objectives.\nHealth: Assesses physical wellbeing, acknowledging that a healthy body is essential for overall life satisfaction.\nUsing the PERMAH framework, we ensure our programs focus on professional success and personal flourishing. This approach helps individuals and organizations achieve sustainable success by aligning personal wellbeing with organizational goals. \n1.2. Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\nThe Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessment evaluates proficiency in recognizing opportunities, mobilizing resources, and taking effective action in various contexts. This assessment is based on the EntreComp framework, a comprehensive tool developed by the European Commission to promote entrepreneurship education and training. EntreComp offers a common reference framework that defines the key competencies necessary for entrepreneurial behavior and mindset.\nWe use the EntrepComp framework to help people build skills along six dimensions:\n\n1.3. Character Strengths \nCharacter strengths are invaluable tools that guide us in developing skills and enhancing our effectiveness in any endeavor. Leveraging these strengths makes learning new things more accessible and enjoyable. In Bloom programs, we use the Values in Action (VIA) Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their “Signature Strengths.” These strengths appear naturally and authentically, providing energy rather than requiring effort. Using our Signature Strengths promotes well-being and vitality in the workplace, leading to greater engagement and productivity. The VIA assessment analyzes virtues and values across cultures, identifying 24 universally recognized character strengths. These strengths are clustered into six core virtues:\n\nWisdom and Knowledge: Creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective, and innovation. These strengths enable us to gain and use knowledge effectively.\nCourage: Bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality, and zest. These strengths help us face challenges and pursue goals despite obstacles.\nHumanity: Love, kindness, and social intelligence. These strengths foster meaningful and supportive relationships with others.\nJustice: Citizenship, fairness, and leadership. These strengths contribute to a just and equitable community.\nTemperance: Forgiveness and mercy, humility, prudence, and self-control. These strengths help us regulate our behaviors and emotions.\nTranscendence: Appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, and spirituality. These strengths connect us to something greater and provide a sense of purpose and meaning.\nBy identifying and using our Signature Strengths, we can bring energy and positivity to our work, fostering a thriving and productive environment. This approach to personal development ensures that individuals achieve professional success and lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.\n1.4. Universal Skills.  \nUniversal Skills are competencies that benefit individuals across all organizational sectors and roles. These skills are critical to our personal development framework, ensuring team members can thrive regardless of their specific personal or professional requirements. Our approach to developing Universal Skills is guided by the Universal Skills Framework from SkillsBuilder.org, which categorizes these skills into four key dimensions:\nCommunication: Enhancing the ability to convey ideas clearly and effectively fostering better understanding and collaboration.\nProblem Solving: Equipping individuals to analyze situations, identify challenges, and develop practical solutions, thereby improving decision-making and innovation.\nSelf-Management: Developing personal discipline, time management, and resilience to navigate complex tasks and maintain productivity under pressure.\nTeamwork: Cultivating the skills necessary for effective collaboration, including empathy, cooperation, and working harmoniously in diverse teams.\nFocusing on these four dimensions ensures that our team members are equipped with versatile skills applicable in any context. This development approach enhances individual performance and contributes to our organization's overall effectiveness and adaptability. Using the Universal Skills Framework, we provide structured and targeted training that supports continuous personal and professional growth, ensuring that our teams are well-prepared to meet the demands of the modern workplace.\nHow To Apply the Individual Development Framework:  \nRequest your participants to take the Bloom Individual Development assessments on the Bloom Platform, which include Universal Skills, Well-being and Engagement, and Character Strengths.\nIn program cycles, discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers can help participants identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from their knowledge, online resources, or the Bloom Library of Activities. \nFor Character Strengths:\nAfter the individuals take the Character Strengths assessments, you can request individuals and teams to identify their Signature Strengths.\nOnce they’ve identified their Signature Strengths, request individuals to select a priority area within their Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills results on the Bloom Learn tab.\nEnd-of-program assessments help participants and program managers see growth and chart paths for further improvement.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Bloom Personal Framework involves critical skills and values that help you be effective as a person.\nIt includes Well-being & Engagement, Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills, Character Strengths and Universal Skills.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nUniversal Skills – Bloom\nWellbeing and Motivation – Bloom\nCharacter Strengths – Bloom\n\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nThe Skills Builder Partnership\nPermah Survey Home - The PERMAH Wellbeing Survey\nVIA Character Strengths Survey & Character Reports | VIA Institute\n\nPillar 2: The Organization\nBloom recommends the following organizational development assessment:\nThe Organizational Development Assessment is a way to assess your enterprise’s organizational status and needs quickly. Teams use it as a self-assessment tool, a guided collaborative process, or program managers can do third-party assessments.\n2.1. Organizational Development  \nOrganizational Capacity is the ability of an organization to achieve its mission while anticipating and managing future changes and risks. Our Organizational Capacity Assessment is derived from established methodologies by international consulting firms, tailored specifically for enterprises and accelerators. Bloom’s Organizational Capacities assessment helps organizations identify blind spots, providing a 360-degree perspective on their current state and guiding them in selecting development areas that will have the most impact. We offer adapted versions of the assessment for enterprises, early-stage enterprises, and accelerators.\nThe Organizational Capacity Assessment categories are:\n\n🎯 Strategy\n📲 Products and Services\n💶 Revenues, Financial Management & Sustainability\n🫶🏽 Corporate Social Responsibility\n🤝 Community Engagement & Communication\n🧑 Team, Leadership, Staff & Volunteers\n👨‍🏫 Innovation & Learning\n🧑🏽‍⚖️ Legal & Compliance\n⚠️ Infrastructure, Risk, Security & Resilience\n\nWhy a Self-Assessment?\nSelf-assessments provide rich information about organizational capacity and inform performance monitoring plans. They are primarily tools for capacity strengthening rather than performance evaluation. A critical aspect of a participatory assessment is fostering a safe space where staff can freely discuss an enterprise’s issues and priorities without fear of consequences when highlighting organizational weaknesses, challenges, and needs for improvement. In summary, self-assessment is a self-diagnosis process where an enterprise reflects on its performance, identifies priorities and goals, and sets a path toward achieving benchmarks. An Enterprise Capacity Assessment supports organizational decision-making and ownership of the capacity development process.\nResults Debrief and Analysis\nThe purpose of this step is to analyze the results with the assessment group so the enterprise can digest and understand the results and compare its current capacity against its longer-term goals. The presentation and discussion of results should be non-judgmental and positive. \nSuggested Steps:\nOpen the session and welcome everyone \nExplain the purpose of this meeting.\nReiterate that all results are indicators rather than performance assessments and encourage continued active participation\nDiscuss and analyze the results\nDiscuss each category with questions such as\nWhat is your reaction to these results? Are there any surprises?\nWhat are your observations about the enterprise’s overall capacity in this category?\nAre the scores for each indicator polarized or consistent with each other? Why?\nWhat is the enterprise doing well? What can the enterprise learn from success in this area?\nSummarize the discussion by highlighting the most surprising results or eliciting the most significant difference in opinion. \nReflect on the assessment results\nAsk the participants to discuss the following questions::\nWhat are our most important issues or weaknesses as an enterprise?\nWhat is causing these issues?\nIdentify key capacity issues revealed during the assessment.\nLook for root causes of issues, not just symptoms.\nIdentify issues common to multiple capacity areas.\nPriority Setting and Action Planning\nThis step helps the enterprise prioritize the issues identified during the assessment for inclusion in the Organization's Development Plan. \nSuggested Steps:\nLink the problems identified with the objectives\nStart with a discussion using these prompts\nDo you think any of the issues identified are more critical than others? Why?\nWhich categories or sub-categories would foster the most significant change in bringing the enterprise closer to its vision and goals?\nAsk the participants to vote on which objective they consider priorities over the next cycle and which should be in the Organization's Development Plan.\nExplain that the number of categories or subcategories to include depends on the time to implement the plan, the complexity of activities, and the resources required. Encourage the group to be pragmatic. \nIdentify key results and significant initiatives for each objective.\nWhat relevant milestones would your enterprise expect to achieve within the program timeframe?\nHow To Apply the Organizational Development Framework:  \nThe program manager invites teams and participants to take the relevant Organization Capacities assessment on the Bloom platform (Enterprise Capacities or Accelerator Capacities). \nAfter participants take the assessment, they are requested to go over their results and discuss with their team, mentor, and program manager to select their priority areas of development and the particular objectives they would like to achieve during the program. \nThe Organization Development Plan is documented using Bloom’s template for the duration of the program and is a shared document between the teams, the mentors, and the program manager. \nRegular progress check-ins during program cycles help the team, mentors, and program managers stay on track, adjust where needed, solve problems, and track progress.\nTeams periodically take the assessment (whole or just for their priority development areas) to celebrate growth and improvements!\n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Bloom framework's second pillar is organizational development. It includes the “doing” work of a person, team, or organization and the skills that help a team flourish. \nIt includes the ​​CAT (Capacity Assessment Tool) system, with specific assessments using categories and questions adapted to the needs of teams and programs. \n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nECAT – Bloom\nProgram Dashboard for [Team Name] Template - Enterprise Capacities v1.1\n\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nAssessing your strengths and weaknesses with the McKinsey Organizational Capacity Assessment Tool (OCAT)\n\n\nSection 2: Running A Program\nStage 0: Preparations\nIn this section, we provide basic information on how accelerators operate. It covers the critical aspects of creating and finalizing program basics.\nProgram Design\nWe can adapt our programs to meet the partner's objectives best, whether for economic development, education, impact/CSR purposes, corporate development, staff training, corporate innovation/intrapreneurship, or others. We refine each approach to design the best program to deliver the desired results. \nSome program design parameters include \nNumber of Teams: Varies by partner\nWe aim to have twice as many teams in the sprint phase as a general rule\nTeam Composition: Varies by partner\nWe generally recommend having at least two team members actively working on the enterprise though it varies depending on enterprise stage.\nEnterprise Stage: From pre-idea, concept/idea stage, startup, or established enterprise. \nEnterprise Development Stages\nStages\nSub-Stages\n0. LEARNING\t\n0.1. Learning without the goal of launching an enterprise\n1. IDEATION\n1.1. Want to start and looking for/testing ideas\n2. IDEA-STAGE\n2.1. Exploring ideas, conducting market/customer research \n2.2. Have started developing my idea\n3. PROTOTYPE\n3.1. Have an early (low-fidelity/paper) prototype (of product or service)\n3.2. Have a functioning (high-fidelity) prototype with early users / early adopters\n4. EARLY-STAGE\n4.1. Declining revenues and the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.2. Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.3. Revenues are multiplying, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n5. GROWTH-STAGE\n5.1. Profitable/sustainable business\n5.2. Seeking scalability (of impact and profits)\n5.3. Seeking diversification \n5.4. Seeking an exit \n5.5. Established national enterprise\n5.6. Established multinational enterprise\n\n\nGeography: Varies by partner\nWithin an internal accelerator/entrepreneurship program or across the UAE, GCC, MENA, or global.\nFunding to Teams: Varies by partner\nImpact Areas: Varies by partner\nGenerally aligned with the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) or for other impact purposes. \nOther criteria: To determine with a partner.\nDefinition of success and program results\nBased on the objectives of the accelerator program, program managers and accelerators can get results to measure the program’s success. We list some later in this guide, but discussing them while building and designing your program is also helpful. \nThe accelerator program work plan will set the tone for program results. Each objective set is measurable and timely and allows for a quantifiable measurement of success. \nAdditionally, impact metrics can be measured depending on the program objectives, including but not limited to jobs created, revenues generated, new product launches, and more. \nProgram Communications\nDeveloping a solid brand is critical in attracting enterprises and other stakeholders. Choosing the best enterprises will lead to good results, attract good investors, and reliable applications. Targeted marketing and clear communication about the program’s criteria, what it offers, and to whom is critical. Creating a content strategy should be the first step.\nA content strategy is a plan of action purposely designed to guide content marketing activities and ensure they deliver against a specific objective. It includes content planning, production, publishing, promoting, tracking, and SEO optimization. It also consists of content you produce, such as videos, blog posts, podcasts, and social media posts. \nYou can see a sample content plan here: HerMeNow Communications Plan (draft)\nSample draft posts for this campaign here: ​​ HerMeNow posts \nThe idea is to ensure that each piece of content you produce resonates heavily with your target audience and serves to rally people behind your program’s objectives. \nSome questions to consider at this stage:\nWhich channels or events would be relevant for marketing your particular program?\nWhich networks would be most effective for reaching the type of enterprises you’d like to work with?\nHow could you communicate the criteria for your program?\nTarget Audience\nAccelerator programs must create a compelling offer to attract the most promising entrepreneurs. \nAccelerators can engage with multiple organizations, stakeholders, and channels to source and attract startups. These include\nReferral from entrepreneurs affiliated with the accelerator\nInvestors\nEntrepreneurial associations\nUniversities\nIndustry Association\nSector-specific conferences\nInbound requests from marketing efforts and social media\nOutbound direct recruiting by finding and contacting entrepreneurs on the web.\nThe quality of applications is far more critical than quantity. Attracting enterprises without growth potential or entrepreneurs for whom the accelerator has nothing to offer will be useless. \nPlanning, roles, and timeline\nWe train others to run high-impact enterprise development support programs that leverage online and in-person engagement. Every program we design has the below-standard program stages.\n\nOnce you agree with the partner on the program parameters, you can start designing the program. \nSee the toolkit at the end of this stage for the program design and planning templates.\nMentor Engagement\nMentorship is a cornerstone of growth in entrepreneurship and leadership, offering invaluable guidance, support, and networking opportunities. We do not pay our mentors to foster a culture of altruism, shared learning, and community engagement, which are critical for building resilient entrepreneurial ecosystems.\nResearch shows that intrinsically motivated mentors provide higher-quality guidance and derive greater satisfaction from mentoring. Effective mentorship builds social capital, creating networks of trust and reciprocity that benefit both mentors and mentees. Non-financial incentives, such as recognition, personal growth, and the opportunity to give back, lead to more committed and impactful mentoring relationships.\nMentors also benefit through reciprocal learning, staying updated with new trends, and gaining fresh perspectives, which enhances their leadership skills. By not monetarily compensating mentors, we emphasize the mutual benefits of mentorship grounded in intrinsic motivation and community spirit.\nA quality mentoring program is crucial for reducing the risk of enterprise failure and is a critical component of successful accelerators. We attract a diverse range of mentors with domain knowledge and entrepreneurial experience, offering two types of mentorship:\nKey Mentors: The principal mentor for a team in our programs. Program managers match you with an enterprise based on your preference and the needs of the business. You will follow the company throughout the program, meeting (online) 1-2 times per month and offering support and guidance when needed.\nTopic Mentors: Topic Mentors support teams in specific areas of expertise (e.g., marketing, HR, etc.).  \nOur mentor selection is based on referrals and direct applications, focusing on extensive entrepreneurial experience rather than academic credentials. We prioritize mentors interested in practical implementation and immediate progress, ensuring that mentoring sessions are action-oriented and impactful.\nTeams and mentors can keep track of their meetings and progress using the “mentor journal” template: Mentorship Journal for [Team Name]\nAny program needs to be monitored and assessed. The quality of mentorship can be evaluated through feedback surveys that the enterprises complete. This information is part of a feedback loop that allows constant improvement in the mentorship process.\nPartner Engagement\nThe partners’ building block consists of the network of suppliers and partners that makes the business model work.\nA successful partnership is most likely to occur when partners lay out clear guidelines at the very start. You are working with each other because partners/NGOs bring something unique and distinctive. So there must be a clear articulation of the end goal regarding the impact and the fundamental guiding principles that will keep the relationship together.\nThese include monitoring mechanisms, reporting requirements, expectations regarding shared resources and engagement levels, mutually agreed-upon communication strategies, an exit plan if things go wrong, etc. \nWe usually have the following partnerships:\nOutreach partners:\nCommunity engagement and outreach\nEngaging your community online and offline (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter networks, along with the newsletters and website) to help us source enterprises for the program.\nKnowledge partners:\nHelp provide mentors, trainers, or experts in relevant sectors or startup/enterprise development areas\nConducting online workshops (ranging from 2 hours to multi-day workshops; preferably recorded sessions), providing mentorship for participating impact startups, helping make relevant connections, etc.\nEcosystem partners:\nSupport for participating projects during the program or downstream\nThey provide additional support, resources, perks, or opportunities to the participating enterprises, whether during or after the program, such as investment/grants, partnerships/contracts, conference/visibility, services, etc. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nTo prepare for launch, program managers need to consider the following:\nTarget audience and stage of enterprises\nDefinition of success and program KPIs\nEssential program communication\nStaffing, roles, and timeline\nMentor engagement\nPartner engagement\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nProgram Design Template\nProgram Planning Template v2\nMentorship Journal for [Team Name]\nPartner MOU - All Categories - TEMPLATE\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nSTARTUP ACCELERATOR PROGRAMMES A Practice Guide\nThe Mentor Manifesto: The original “Mentor Manifesto,” created by David Cohen with the help of Jon Bradford and Brad Feld, outlines a set of principles supported by years of accelerator work and thousands of mentor interactions.\nDeconstructing the Mentor Manifesto: Brad Feld goes in depth through each component of the manifesto. \n\nStage 1: Outreach & Open House\nThe program starts with an Open House period. It refers to when a team becomes aware of the existence of an accelerator program. The accelerator’s success in this phase depends on the strength of its brand and how it markets itself. The Open House events are typically virtual and open to the public.\nOur Open Houses are a way to ask questions and get answers. You can join virtually to learn more about learning to grow in our accelerator programs and build connections. As a result, teams leave with a better understanding of our program and if it may be a good fit for them.\nOpen House Events\nDuring these 4-6 weeks, we host online webinars featuring prominent speakers sharing their experiences with aspiring entrepreneurs. It is also a space for applicants to meet and start forming a community. Here are some blog posts recapping previous open-house events.\nThere are four main reasons to run an Open House:  \nAttract, vet, and prepare applicants \nDid we attract the quality and quantity of intended teams? \nIdentify participants that may be appropriate for an online program and this program. \nHelp people become more familiar with the tools and approaches of the program. \nBring visibility to the program and the partner.\nProgram managers can record each open house event and transform it into a blog post to share on social media to attract more applicants.\nRecorded events become part of a shareable library of content accessible to the Bloom community.\nInspire and educate the potential applicants\nThe topics for the open house events are timely and relevant to the current situation to help the applicants learn something new about their trade.\nThe events are an opportunity for the program managers to present the program and for the applicants to ask questions.\nBring visibility to Bloom and engage/strengthen the Bloom community (mentors, broader startups, partners, etc.)  \nEngaging the mentors by asking them to participate as speakers \nEngaging the partners by inviting them and asking them to intervene\nShowcasing startups that have been in the program previously\nApplication Form\nChoosing which enterprises to select is one of the essential factors in the success of any accelerator. While attracting the entrepreneurs to the Open House events, we place them in a marketing funnel to submit to the second stage of the application process. This stage includes demographic information and details about the enterprise.\nDepending on your program, you can select different criteria, such as\nDemographic Data\nGender\nAge\nLocation\nNationality\nInformation about the enterprise/startup: \nWebsite and social media links \nPlease describe your company and the problem you're solving in 280 characters.\n2 min pitch\nFive slide pitch deck\nEnterprise Stage: dropdown\nAreas of development: Enterprise Capacities dropdown\nTraction\nSize of team\nInvestment Raised\nRegistration Status\nIt is essential to keep in mind that the quality of applications is far more critical than quantity. Attracting enterprises without growth potential or entrepreneurs for whom the accelerator has nothing to offer will be useless. Targeted marketing and clear communication about the program’s criteria, what it provides, and to whom are critical.\nSummarized list of things to prepare:\nBrevo Registration Form\nAutomated Email on Brevo with link to apply\nProgram on Bloom platform under the correct organization\nApplication Link on the Bloom platform\nAutomated email on Mailgun to confirm receiving their application\nAutomated Reminder Email on Brevo after they start their application to complete it\nStart here category on Bloom community program category with intro video and FAQ\nCreating the application\nStep 1: Create a form on Brevo with: First and Last Name, Email, and Company Name\nStep 2: Create an automated email that gets sent for each form submission with more details about the program and the link to the second stage application form\nCreating the second stage application form \nStep 1: Decide which fields to include in the application form.

In a nutshell, it’s a way for teams to spend a fixed amount of time on core enterprise development using today’s best practices in a coherent, integrated fashion. \nWe also sometimes run longer versions of Sprints that we call Bootcamps, usually between 4-8 weeks long. The key difference lies in the number of sessions:\nA Sprint is two weeks long and include 6 sessions (3 sessions per week) plus a Demo Day\nA Bootcamp can vary between 4 to 8 weeks:\nA 4 week Bootcamp has 3 sessions (one session per week) plus a Demo Day\nAn 8 week Bootcamp has 6 sessions (one session per week) plus a Demo Day\nIn Bloom’s standard programs, the Sprint/Bootcamp has two main objectives: \nTo help teams learn new skills and progress in their enterprise. \nTo help us learn more about the teams during our selection process for the Accelerator. \nWe’ve found that we learn more about the people and projects through a short program than through an application process and interviews. So here is how we do it:\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp allows us to assess enterprises’ strengths as we look for entrepreneurs who can overcome the obstacles necessary to build a great business. This phase helps us get to know and understand why teams have an unfair advantage over all the other candidates.\nSelection from Open House to Sprint/Bootcamp/Pre-Accelerator\nFirst, we disqualify candidates who do not check all eligibility criteria. Then, a selection committee will score the selection against the following scoring matrix.\n\nEligibility\nAssessing whether the application fits the program's eligibility criteria.\nYES / NO \nTeam \nAssessing the team’s background, capabilities to execute, and ability to gain and contribute to the program. \n/ 10\nImpact & Inclusion\nDoes the enterprise have a social impact? Can it create jobs? Does it have a positive impact on marginalized and vulnerable communities?\n/ 10\nValue Proposition\nIs the team tackling a real problem and offering a valuable solution? Does it have the ability to grow and be sustainable? Is the market potential attractive?\n/ 10\nMilestones & Traction\nCan the idea generate revenues? Have they achieved significant milestones? Has the team demonstrated it can compete?\n/ 5\nStrategy & Challenges\nDo they have a clear growth strategy? Is the program able to support the team in its current challenges?\n/ 5\nOverall Passion\nBased on the team's strength,  the project, and the potential impact it can create: how passionate are you about this application?\n/ 10\n\nSprint/Bootcamp Session Objectives\nOutlined below are some of the frameworks and tools we use during the Sprint session to help the enterprises progress on their goals and improve at least one aspect of their enterprise during the Sprint/Bootcamp sessions. \nDiscovering your Why: How do you talk about what you do?\nThe Golden Circle is a concept developed by Simon Sinek, who says, “people don’t buy what you do. They buy why you do it.”\nAccording to Sinek, most people communicate by starting with the “what” they do and eventually work their way back to talk about “how” and “why” they do what they do.\nBut companies universally identified as unique and successful think Apple or Google communicate with an “inside-out” type of thinking. \nThey start with the why, and only then do they talk about the how and what portions of what they do.\nTo use the Golden Circle for your enterprise, just help them answer three simple questions:\nWhy – Why are you doing what you are doing? For example, why are you in business, and why did you develop your product or service?\nHow – How will this help your readers? For example, what problems are you solving for your readers, and what challenges are you helping them overcome?\nWhat – What are you offering? For example, what is your product or service, and what are its features and benefits?\nAssessing: What are your priorities for the upcoming period?\nProgram managers invite the teams to take the assessments to reflect on their individual and organizational development. After reflecting on their results in their teams, program managers invite them to discuss them with their peers and mentors and start thinking about their core priority areas of development.\nGoal setting: What are your objectives for the duration of the accelerator?\nWe provide the enterprises with a framework to specify their objectives for the upcoming period they spend with us during the accelerator, usually three to four months. The enterprises must accompany these objectives with measurable key results assigned to specific team members for accountability. The enterprise can further break down objectives into particular initiatives and key activities. We recommend that enterprises work on at least one objective and up to three objectives for the duration of the accelerator. Each objective must relate to a particular organizational development topic they identified while reflecting on their priorities. \nWe invite teams to develop an Organization Development Plan stating their main objective related to their core area of organizational development. We also consider their signature character strength and overall well-being for the program duration. Teams will also develop this Organization Development Plan with a budget to help the Bloom team assess the needs accordingly.\nBudgeting: How will you use the funds allocated for the accelerator?\nWe provide enterprises with a budgeting tool to help them think about allocating their funds to the accelerator program. It allows them to think strategically about their objectives and goals, given their plans earlier during the week around the objectives and key results they aim to achieve. Funds are allocated to specific categories to help us align the overall budgets and work on economies of scale. \nPitching: How will you combine this using the Pitch Deck template?\nA pitch deck is usually a 5-10 slide presentation designed to summarize the company, the business plan, and the vision. The pitch presentation deck also serves different purposes, from meeting with a new investor to presenting in front of a stage. Each of them should follow a different structure. A demo day presentation, for example, should be very visual and contain very little text, as the entrepreneur will do all the talking. \nWe provide enterprises with a 5-10 slide deck template to adapt their branding and content accordingly. \nSelection from Sprint/Bootcamp to Accelerator\nThe program aims to help participants transform personally, professionally, and professionally. \nTo be fair, we have a 2-step process: \nStep 1: Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges \nFor the Sprint/Bootcamp phase, judges decide whether a team advances based on the team’s pitches during the online Demo Day. \nWe enlist the services of expert volunteer “Judges” who are independent and objective, with no conflicts of interest. \nThese judges review team pitches and determine each team’s potential for long-term success based on the judge’s experience and the quality of the team’s pitch during the demo day.\nJudging will take place during the online Demo Day on Zoom. \nProgram managers will share the link to submit scores with all judges before the Demo Day event. \nIf too many teams are at the end of the Sprint/Bootcamp (15 or more), it might be difficult to pitch in one group. In this case, we could split the pitch day into multiple simultaneous sessions, with up to 10 teams in a breakout session and a separate judging panel per breakout room. Representatives from each breakout session judging panel will be part of the Accelerator Selection Panel. \nWe also invite the teams to share feedback on all the pitches, though we calculate the scoring separately. \nStep 2: Accelerator Selection Panel \nPrimarily a subset of the Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges \nThe Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges' feedback will be summarized, along with the Sprint/Bootcamp Scoring Template, and shared with the Accelerator Selection Panel, which will do a final review and selection in the days following the Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day. \nAccelerator Selection Criteria\nWe measure the principles for selection with the following assessments:\nEvaluation Area\nDescription\nWeight\nEffort\nThe teams have a significant say in advancing to the next stage based on their effort during the Sprint/Bootcamp. We measure the effort according to attendance, feedback participation, and deliverables. \n1/4\nSupport\nThe teams are also scored based on how supportive they are to the other teams in the Sprint/Bootcamp. \n1/4\nCoachability\nThe team is receptive to receiving constructive criticism and will use that feedback and constructive criticism to improve their professional and organizational performance.\n1/4\nDemo Day Score\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp ends with a Demo Day where the enterprises pitch online, and judging will occur between presentations. The Judging panel will include mentors and trainers from the program and independent experts from the ecosystem. \n1/4\n\n\nThe Judges’ scores (Demo Day Score) and the Bloom team scores (Effort, Support, and Coachability) are shared with a selection panel composed of Bloom and External Experts for deliberations and donor representatives. The panel will make the final selection for acceptance in addition to the validation of support required per team. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Sprint/Bootcamp has two main objectives: \nFirst, to help teams learn new skills and progress in their enterprise. \nTo help us learn more about the teams during our selection process for the Accelerator. \nThe following frameworks guide the participants during the Sprint/Bootcamp phase:\nThe elevator pitch using the golden circle framework\nPersonal, professional, and organizational assessments\nGoal Setting\nBudgeting\nPreparing for the demo day\nThe selection process includes:\nSelecting for the Sprint/Bootcamp based on eligibility and scoring for success using metrics defined by program objectives\nSelecting for the accelerator, based on the demo day scoring and scores for effort, community, and results\nTOOLKIT: (diagnostic assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nThe Golden Circle Presentation\nECAT – Bloom\nProgram Planning Template v2\nSprint Detailed Schedule Template\nSample Program Comms\nProgram Dashboard for [Team Name] Template - Enterprise Capacities v1.1\nSprint Pitch Deck Template\nSprint Scoring Template―\nStage 3: Onboarding and Curriculum Design\nOnboarding to the Accelerator\nAfter announcing the teams that will proceed to the accelerator stage, the program manager spends time with each selected team to\nRefine their dashboards and align their objectives and initiatives with the Enterprise Capacities categories, keeping in mind the below recommendations:\nThe enterprise's objectives should align with its overall objective for the program.\nThe objectives are achievable within the timeframe of the program.\nEach objective has a key result that should be measurable with a starting value and a target value that measures progress toward an objective.\nEach initiative aligns with the set category and topics.\nThe “enterprise development topics” for initiatives are valid and aligned with the “enterprise development category” for the related objective.\nThe enterprise might be unsure how to match its objectives with the “enterprise development category.” The program manager can help them refine their dashboard during these one-on-ones\nHelp the teams add their priorities on the platform\nOnce the dashboards are clear for the team and the program manager, the team will log on to the platform and start adding their priorities:\nThe team navigates to the Growth page.\nThe team selects their priority area per their dashboard (the “Enterprise Development Category” for their first objective).\nIn the “add goal details” text box, the team adds their objective, key results, and initiatives\nExplain the individual assessments to the teams, help them identify their signature character strength, and select their priority areas for skills \nThe program manager will explain the individual assessments:\nThe teams can take the Character Strength Assessment on the Bloom Platform and identify their “Signature Strength.” It is a strength that shows up quickly and authentically, giving people energy when used rather than taking effort. Using our Signature Strengths can help us bring energy and promote well-being at work. Once they do that, they should add their Signature Strength on their dashboard so we can support them in leveraging it during the program.\nTeams can take the Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills assessment on the Bloom platform to identify areas of improvement. In discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers, they can identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from online resources or the Bloom Library of Activities. \nCustomizing the Curriculum\nWe strive to adapt the curriculum to each new cohort of enterprises that best caters to their needs. We base this customization on inputs from the Growth Page on the platform:\nOnce we complete the onboarding process, we have a clear view of all the teams’ priorities and objectives for the duration of the program, allowing us to customize the curriculum accordingly.\nThe Assessment results of each enterprise: We look at priorities selected during the onboarding and the score trends in each category.\nThe Team's Organization Development Plans: We look at the specific objective and initiatives to understand what they aim to achieve.\nAt this stage, the program manager and the training manager can design the cohort-based training activities that the teams will do during the program and prepare for the first session of the accelerator program. \nWhile we aim to find commonalities between all the teams, it is never possible to cater to everyone’s needs. Once we set the common needs, we reach out to the teams with individual needs to help them identify training activities they can do at their own pace and get feedback from mentors and trainers individually.\nLearning by Doing\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, there is nothing more important than “doing” and “testing” to understand the product, customers, and business model. At Bloom, we know how much theory we introduce to entrepreneurs versus how much time we give them to achieve results. Teaching entrepreneurs theory is inevitable — it is crucial to understand the context — but we make sure that every idea comes with a framework or a tool that entrepreneurs can use and develop over time to achieve their goals. These tools make robust theories actionable. Once we introduce them to our program, we make an effort to revisit them during the program over and over again, in the best spirit of lean startup methodology, so we make sure we are helping the startups drive progress and results.\nModular Learning\nModular learning, as the word connotes, uses learning modules that facilitate entrepreneurs learning by themselves. It is a form of distance learning that uses Self-Learning Modules based on the essential learning competencies developed by the trainers with the aid of the program and training manager.\nWhen there’s teaching, it’s tempting to sit students down in a classroom and show them what they need to know. But GALI found that “the more remote work we allow, the better.” For example, indirect learning, which focuses on the student’s inquiry and exploration rather than the teacher’s instruction, allows entrepreneurs to learn while working on their business plans and product. \nAccelerators should design curricula around things entrepreneurs do remotely that serve the dual function of teaching valuable lessons and helping advance the startup. It is better to use the time to build relationships and get feedback. Online education with e-learning modules allows founders to spend more time building networks and products.\nOnce the teams complete the training activity, we invite them to share their work in the community to get feedback from their peers and program managers. They will then join an online training session to get further feedback from their peers and expert trainers. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nCurriculums are customized according to teams’ Enterprise Capacities results, Organization Development Plan, surveys, and one-on-one interviews to identify the most present needs\nContent is created well before training sessions so entrepreneurs can learn at their own pace, apply their learning on homework, templates, and tools, and get feedback in sessions with the trainers.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nProgram Planning Template v2\nBloom Digital Library\n\nStage 4: Accelerator \nBloom Accelerator Programs Principles\nBelow are the five principles that guide the design of our accelerator programs.\nPraxis: learning happens by doing and reflecting.\nPraxis is the process by which a skill is embodied or realized. \"Praxis\" refers to engaging, applying, exercising, learning, or practicing ideas. Praxis is critical thinking that combines reflection and action.\nBloom tools: In our programs, this is applied by encouraging enterprises to record their daily tasks and activities on the Bloom task board. \nStrengths Oriented: use momentum and do more of what’s working.\nThe strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes of a person or a group rather than the negative ones. This approach builds on the entrepreneurs’ strengths, specifically seeing them as resourceful and resilient when in adverse conditions. Strengths are integral to our human identity, constituting the intrinsic and inherent qualities that define us as individuals. However, few are conscious and appreciative of them or particular about how we can best put them to use to achieve desired outcomes.\nUsing strengths energizes and motivates individuals to contribute discretionary effort towards attaining their goals. At the same time, it nourishes a feeling of achievement because they perform the things they are best at doing. Research indicates that when individuals use their strengths, they feel happier, more confident and proud, and more engaged at work. In addition, they perform better while experiencing a sense of resilience in achieving their goals. \nBloom tools: In our programs, we apply this by administering personal assessments to identify entrepreneurs’ strengths and capitalize on them through our library of activities that help build the strengths. Additionally, we developed the Enterprise Capacity Assessment to measure the organizational capacity of enterprises. It allows us to have the whole picture of the strengths of both the entrepreneur and the enterprise.\nGrowth Mindset: 1% better every day, 200% better in 70 days.\nA growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and stretching our existing abilities. Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. As a result, they tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). It is because they worry less about looking bright and put more energy into learning. \nStriving to get 1% better daily is a core tenet of the growth mindset principle. This system encourages action by breaking down big, overwhelming goals into small, discrete pieces. The small successes you experience with your baby steps feed on each other and start building momentum, leading to more prominent and significant moves.\nWe encourage our entrepreneurs to try to do just 1% better than the day before. Start small and make your increases gradual. Avoid the temptation to get impatient and start rushing forward and taking more significant leaps. Take it slow, steady, and consistent.\nSimply try to do a little better than you did the day before. Daily, just focus on getting 1% better in whatever you try to improve. That’s it. Just 1%. It might not seem like much, but those 1% improvements compound each other. \nBloom Tools: Our programs encourage entrepreneurs to look at their weekly power moves. Power Moves are the moves that take us out of our comfort zone and push us forward. Those exhilarating first steps allow us to make many more steps. Power Moves take you right out of your regularly scheduled program. They are the key to real change. They’re the most critical task that will take you one step closer to your goal.\nStep by Step: Pick a target, make it tractable, get to it, and review it.\nBreaking projects down into their parts is oft-repeated advice when tackling something big. Breaking tasks down helps us see large tasks as more approachable and doable and reduces our propensity to procrastinate or defer tasks because we simply don’t know where to begin.\nEntrepreneurs should break down the tasks to a point where they can produce a reliable estimate. Each key objective should have a clearly defined task or set of tasks. Tasks should be between 8 and 80 person-hours of labor. It is a manageable amount.\nBloom Tools: We ask our teams to prepare an Organization Development Plan that includes at least one and up to three critical objectives tied into key results and broken down into significant activities or tasks. It allows us to understand what the enterprise intends to accomplish during the accelerator period. Additionally, we encourage enterprises to use the Bloom Taskboard to record their daily tasks and keep track of their progress to accomplish what they’ve planned within their set deadlines. \nCommunity: We grow best when we grow together.\nWe rarely grow alone. Being part of an engaging community gives us a sense of belonging. It enables us to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of each other, ourselves, and our environment. Being a part of a community can make us feel like we are a part of something greater than ourselves. Providing unique opportunities for people to learn from each other and support and encouragement are invaluable in joining forces with our peers.\nBloom Tools: We aim to create a healthy community for our enterprises, starting with:\nThe teams: Being part of a community enables us to support other members. Supportive of others will help them feel good and better about themselves. \nThe mentors: An open bond with new connections builds valuable relationships and gives us a more profound sense of belonging. It helps us to reach our goals and brings a sense of security.\nThe module leaders: Communities are rich in resources. Knowing is a unique resource, and through its use, it increases in value. \nWe encourage entrepreneurs to use the inverted pyramid in the context of learning and feedback. First, they evaluate themselves, then get feedback from their mentors, and then the module leaders give feedback. \nThe general architecture of a cycle\nBloom cycles takes the best from agile and design thinking methodologies used at leading innovation companies globally. We use these in our sprint and accelerator programs to help teams develop their startup while learning leading productivity techniques.\nCycle repetitions can include some of the below elements:\nActivities and Reflections\nWeekly activities: Every other Tuesday, the program manager invites the teams to start new training activities and share their progress in the community\nEnd-of-month reflections: At the end of each month, we send the teams a reflection and feedback form to understand and gauge their progress on several KPIs related to the program’s focus. \nLive online events\nTraining sessions: Each cycle will have 2-4 training activities whereby teams will receive resources, including videos, tools, frameworks, and worksheets, to prepare them for the training sessions, where the module leader will facilitate an interactive exchange of knowledge and expertise.\nMentor support: We invite mentors to join a speed mentoring session to facilitate mentor matching. Once we match them, we invite the teams and mentors to set their meeting frequency throughout the accelerator, where they follow up on the enterprise’s progress, approve their budget, help them with their hiring needs, and others as needed.\nTypical Schedule of an Acceleration Program\nCurriculum co-creation and onboarding (1 week, two sessions).\nSession 1: Based on the onboarding sessions, we identify the cohort-based training activities of the accelerator program and present them with the modules they commit to achieving. We will put them in the driver's seat from day one, allowing us to identify standard modules & group them into sessions tackling the same topics in cohort-based activities and individual modules they are interested in tackling separately according to their enterprise needs. We also introduce them to the grant disbursement process and deep dive into best practices to plan their financial journey and ensure they are not delayed.\nSession 2: We invite the teams and mentors to join for a mentor matching session where each team meets at least three mentors. Based on their feedback forms filled at the end of the session, we will facilitate the matching for the duration of the accelerator.\nWeekly training and support (12-16 weeks, 12-16 group training sessions, and two to four individual mentorship sessions per team).\nBased on our program feedback in the last two years, we have adjusted the weekly support to cater to our teams' needs and rhythms. We build a panel of 4-5 trainers who can give general feedback on several modules in our new approach. A trainer joins in every weekly session with up to five teams at once to have enough time for deep discussions. \nDuring the weekly sessions, the teams can share what they’ve learned during the module and discuss their work related to their projects. They will receive feedback from their peers, trainers, and program managers to improve further (inverted feedback pyramid). \nIn addition, teams can book up to 4 follow-up one-on-one meetings with the trainers, mentors, and coaches to deepen the hands-on feedback further, mentoring and coaching experience at the individual and team levels. \nBased on the teams' assessment results, the curriculum will be co-created during the onboarding. After the co-creation sessions, we will select trainers, mentors, and business coaches from our Mentors and Trainers databases.\nDepending on each team’s core priorities, the curriculum might include topics that tackle questions such as \nBranding\nDo we build our brand effectively?\nProblem Solving\nHow strong is our mission?\nHave we identified what value we deliver to our customers with well-defined and aligned products and services?\nSolution Definition\nHave we identified relevant social responsibility factors for our business and industry, and are the social responsibility principles integrated into the overall corporate strategy?\nTarget Market\nHave we clearly defined who we are creating value for and who our most important customers are? \nDo we have clear strategies and channels to reach our customers? \nBasic Revenue Model\nDo we have solid financial plans and clear financial performance indicators?\nAre our revenue streams clearly defined, and how effective is our revenue generation model?\nMilestones and Next Steps\nDo we regularly read and stay on top of global business and industry trends?\nDo we have a coherent organizational strategy, including mission, vision, values, and operational plan?\nTeam\nDo we have diverse and highly skilled staff?\nAre our people (the organization's leadership and staff) satisfied and motivated in their work?\nDo we have a learning culture?\nDo we have the right people and resources (e.g., tools, budget) to provide our products/services?\nWhile some of those topics might already exist in the Bloom Digital Library, we could also commission trainers to develop additional training content if we find a gap that needs to be filled. \nWe send thank you emails to trainers after they complete the cycle to share gratitude.\nAsync accountability on the Bloom platform\nTeams can schedule mentors' sessions at their convenience, tracked on the community of the Bloom platform by posting a reflection on their notes from their mentorship journals. Teams also submit assignments to the community to hold each other responsible and accountable for the module they chose to take at the beginning of the program. Finally, the program manager will encourage the teams to review their peers’ work and give constructive and generous feedback. Indeed by looking at the same challenge from a different perspective, they are encouraged to unlearn and relearn.\nGrant Disbursement Process\nThe Grant Disbursement process will vary slightly depending on the enterprise stage and the grant amount.\nFor earlier-stage enterprises (not registered), the agreement and invoice are with individuals rather than enterprises. \nWe can apply the same basic steps to all programs:\nEnterprises sign the Agreement: \nProgram managers adapt the program agreement template and invite the teams to make a copy.\nTeams complete and sign the agreement by adding a digital signature as an image in the document.\nEnterprises refine the budget:\nThe objectives and key initiatives in the work plan should be related to the budget developed for the grant.\n70-80% of the budget is for capacity building instead of running costs.\nEnterprises get the budget approved:\nEnterprises work on improving it with their mentor and program manager. \nOnce ready and approved, the Mentor + Program manager adds their initials and the date approved on the budget.\nEnterprises get the budget signed:\nThe enterprises sign the budget in the designated cell by uploading a digital signature as an image in the cell.\nThe Program Manager, Finance Officer, and Program Lead sign the budget. \nThe enterprises send us an invoice for the amount (from the Enterprise to AltCity Impact)\nSpecific account information to include in the invoice varies:\nFor programs disbursing from the Lebanon bank account, we include the below:\nAltCity Impact / Bloom\nBeirut, Lebanon\nMOF: 3241751 (Ministry of Finance number)\nEmail: accts@bloom.pm\nDescription: Grant disbursement / Project reference: [Name of the program]\nFor programs disbursing from the UK bank account, we include the below:\nCOMPANY NUMBER: OC442441\nINCORPORATED: 25 May 2022\nREGISTERED OFFICE ADDRESS:\n71-75 Shelton Street\nCovent Garden\nLondon\nWC2H 9JQ\nUNITED KINGDOM\nWe disburse the grant in one tranche for smaller grants (2,000 USD or less).\nTo ensure proper procurement and financial management, we disbursed in 2-3 tranches for larger amounts. \nFor enterprises not yet registered, we will release the second tranche of the grant based on the progress achieved on the objectives set in the organizational development plan.\nFor registered enterprises, after receiving the first tranche, the enterprise sends all the proof of payments (invoices/bills/photos) and an updated variance report that needs to align with the Approved Budget with the next invoice for the next tranche.\nProcurement Process for Registered Enterprises\nThis process applies to registered enterprises receiving grants larger than 2,000 USD.\nPlease watch this video for detailed information: Procurement Process\nQuotations:\n$500 - $1,000: Quotation must be sent to AltCity Impact finance team as supporting document for the coming tranches.\n$1,001 and above: 3 quotations must be presented along with a quotation analysis form clearly stating the selection criteria and the selected supplier.\nInvoices:\nAll supplier invoices must be addressed to the enterprise name.\nAll invoices must be official and mention a USD amount.\nPayment:\nA payment request form must be filled out and signed before proceeding with the payment to the supplier.\nGoods received:\nOnce the purchased items are received, a good received note must be filled and submitted to the AltCity Impact finance team as a supporting document for the coming tranches.\nAll the templates for the procurement process are here.\nPurchase Category\nSupporting Documentation\nSalaries\nEmployment contract \nDebit note\nAll Consulting Categories\nConsulting Contract\nInvoice\nProof of Work \nStartup Progress report \nDebit Note \nConsulting -

Make sure to inform the teams before the session on their pitch duration so that they practice accordingly. The goal is to prevent the moderator from cutting them off publicly, but it is also essential to be strict about keeping to the time limit (possibly with a 10-15 second buffer, max). \nThe presentation order, tables, and list order on any forms should all be numbered and aligned precisely the same way. \nHave the team name, presenter’s name, team members' names, and “presentation number” of the last team on the slide to stay visible to the audience while scoring. Perhaps it could be the team’s title slide with that additional information added. \nHave different staff/team members moderating, time-keeping, making slides/music, etc. Split up roles so nobody is multitasking too much. \nIf technical limitations make it challenging to give the presenters the ability to control the shared screen, have all the teams presenting snap their fingers, so they don’t have to keep saying “next” out loud. \nThe person presenting should turn their video off if the sound is glitchy. Most importantly, their voice and the slides, though seeing them speaking would also be lovely if possible. \nEveryone turns on their microphones at the end to clap for all the teams. :-) Maybe we even do that during the opening “tadaa” to hear everyone’s voice. It is nice to do at the closing of the event as well. \nEncourage teams to present standing up, not sitting down, so they need to set up their laptop (and headphones) in a way that would allow that and not have that be at an awkward angle. \nEncourage all teams to use headphones for better sound quality. \nEncourage all teams to do some warm-up exercises before the presentation. For example, super-hero pose, jumping jacks, stretching, running in place, dance, “coffee breathing,” etc. \nMake things easy for people to switch between Zoom and Remo; create onboarding videos to share with all attendees ahead of time, and encourage them to join Remo / and sign me. \nEncourage teams a week in advance to start inviting their family/friends/future investors.\nAll teams put their username/screen name as “Team Name - Full Name.” \nUse zoom dual monitors > Show participants screen \nEncourage teams to practice, practice, practice! \nHype up the teams! :-) \nSlide Preparation for an Online Demo Day \nHaving a smooth flow between presentations is vital. Having all presentations in one Google Slides presentation can improve the flow substantially. \nIf possible, test ahead of time. You can give participants the ability to control the person sharing the screen. It will allow each speaker to control the slides themselves. However, it often doesn’t work as smoothly in practice because of technical issues, internet delays, or little comfort with the online tools. \nAdvanced Google Docs users can have the teams use separate presentations linked to one master presentation. For example, when copy-pasting from a team presentation into the main presentation, choose “linked slides.” This way, when the teams update their presentations (just those slides), the master presentation is automatically linked.\nTip: Once a presentation is in “present mode,” new changes will not show. It may be best to have an organizer “own” the team’s presentations to remove the team’s ability to edit by a particular deadline. \nHave the team name, presenter’s name, team members' names, and “presentation number” of the last team on the slide to stay visible to the audience while scoring. Perhaps it could be the team’s title slide with that additional information added. \nMake sure all teams send in a recorded pitch video before the session, just in case a team was unable to attend the demo day for any reason (medical, emergency..) or even for reasons such as having terrible internet connection and being unable to connect and join the demo day. Share the folder of “recorded pitch videos” with all the programs team and facilitators.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nOnline demo days can be as effective as in-person. There are different ways to facilitate the event online, and plenty of tools are available to help you make the most of it. \nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nN/A\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nPlanning a Virtual Demo Day: a Careful Balance of Two Worlds\nHow to run a successful inclusive online event - our Demo Day lessons\n\nStage 6: Program Closing, Continual Assessment, and Improvement\nAt the end of the program, we design certificates of completion to the teams and mentors to express our gratitude and appreciation for their support. \nA key challenge area for accelerators measures impact. As yet, an agreed framework for measuring the performance of an accelerator program does not exist, but standard metrics collected and published so far include the following:\nNumber of applications to programs\nNumber of enterprises supported\nFollow-on investment raised by enterprises\nThe survival rate of enterprises\nNumber of employees of enterprises\nNPS of the program\nWe believe that we should pay more attention to defining performance and metrics for success. Unfortunately, as startups, accelerators often lack the time and resources for such measurements, so the impact of accelerator methods is difficult to judge with limited data available. \nHere are some metrics we recommend you track:\nMonthly: For each program, data is collected monthly depending on the KPIs the program manager sets. This could include items such as\nPre and post-assessment results\nOrganization Development Plan progress and status update for each activity\nRevenues\nExpenses\nTraction (most relevant metric per enterprise)\nFeedback on this month’s accelerator activities\nEngagement\nLearning \nInspiration\nComplexity\nRelevance\nPost-Program: Program managers should collect the following data quarterly post-accelerator.\nKPIs\nFinance\nRevenue\nExpenses\nBurn rate & runway.\nCash in the bank\nEBITDA\nTraction\nChurn rate: %, an improvement of % vs. last month.\nCustomer acquisition: $\nCustomer Lifetime Value: $\nOrders per Customer: #\nTime on site before ordering\nTotal user accounts #\nActive users: #\nPaying users: #\nProduct Updates\nchanges in the product strategy, including new versions, UX/UI, new features, platform, etc. \nBusiness Updates\nWhat is relevant about people, office, partners, operations, etc.\nNew hires/fires.\nMarketing strategy.\nNew partnerships.\nInternational expansion plans.\nOperations changes.\nPress updates.\n Funding or Mergers and Acquisitions\nNotable Events\n\nKEY POINTS: \nA key challenge area for accelerators measures impact. As yet, an agreed framework for measuring the performance of an accelerator program does not exist, but standard metrics collected and published are included in this section.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nN/A\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nChoosing and Reporting Accelerator Metrics KPIs – Metabeta\n\nStage 7: Program Epilogue: Post-Program Support\nIt is easy to see the duration of the program as a set timeframe for which the demo day marks the end. But this isn’t the way that accelerators perceive it. On graduating from an accelerator program, companies are still extremely young, and potentially not yet viable for investment. Everything an accelerator program does is geared toward giving its cohorts the best possible chance of survival after graduation. So it makes sense that most offer post-program support to maintain or enhance startups’ investment viability for as long as possible. \nIt can typically include the following:\nPublic relations opportunities\nConnections with investors\nBoard participation\nHR/recruitment support\nLocal meet-ups\nOnline communities with funding and promotion opportunities\nOffice space\nAlumni Network\nAll accelerators acknowledge their alumni network as a valuable asset of the program: maintaining an alumni database is, therefore, a priority. Some host online communities and alumni events to create and develop the alumni network. Others call on the help of alumni when selecting a new cohort of potential startups. There is also the phenomenon of recycling founders, where startups take in unsuccessful alumni as members of their team if they consider them valuable.\nFollow-on Investment\nAccelerated startups still struggle with gaps between seed funding and successfully raising Series A investment. To help combat this, some accelerators offer to follow–on investment once the program is finished; they can sometimes go some way towards bridging funding gaps. This could be by providing staged investments or an additional capital infusion after graduation.\nMentorship, Perks, and Opportunities\nOnce enterprises are part of an accelerator. They will be part of the community for life. They can expand their business and network with access to a talented group of founders, investors, mentors, and industry leaders. Additionally, the accelerator will typically have onboarded perks partners, providing the enterprises with discounts and access to helpful resources. Finally, keeping in touch with the accelerator community can be beneficial as program managers often share resources, opportunities, and other relevant information.\n\nAppendix\nRunning Hybrid Programs\nWe can think of the acceleration programs in two models: \nThose that run face-to-face, which allow entrepreneurs to meet in a physical space at the same time, and \nThose that are carried out regardless of physical barriers, the time zone, the thousands of kilometers of distance between people, or even complex situations (such as those we have been experiencing in the last years).\nVirtual accelerator programs are growing in popularity and have several advantages for founders and program teams. Virtual programs can also be delivered in a hybrid format, blending both online & offline elements. Virtual and Hybrid Accelerator programs allow\nImproved Flexibility\nOne of the main benefits of hybrid programs is improved flexibility, which is becoming extremely important within the sector. Generally speaking, entrepreneurs want as many options as possible, and the ability to move from in-person to remote can be invaluable. Access to recorded sessions offers a second chance at missed sessions, memory refreshers, and a deeper reflection of session discussions.\nWork with a more significant number of enterprises from much broader geographic areas.\nThe most exciting aspect of hybrid programs for many entrepreneurs is their potential to open up access to learning. On a basic level, when in-person is the only option available, all entrepreneurs need to be within traveling distance of the accelerator throughout the entire duration of their course. However, It is not necessarily the case with hybrid programs, which can mean more people can participate. This will expose the teams to meet people coming from diverse cultural backgrounds. In turn, this will lead to an increased cultural quotient and enhanced collective intelligence exercises. \nSupport your Accelerator community, even during lockdowns\nOne problem we’ve run into in the past is the limited pool of mentors available for any given in-person workshop. Virtual programming has freed us up to engage world-class mentors from anywhere, including mentors that bring enormous technical, business, and market knowledge and speak the language of the startups in our cohort – culturally and literally.\nLeveraging your workshop content to create a reusable library\nE-Learning is no longer a simple byproduct of the information age and Internet access. It’s become an invaluable resource to educators, harnessing a new knowledge-sharing model wherein learners now possess the tools to learn at their own pace. Some online tools allow for quickly creating tests/quizzes, templates, and other resources. Practical benefits include tracking digital assignments’ submissions and reusing or reconstructing a course curriculum using new course templates.\nKEY POINTS: \nHybrid programs allow program managers to work with:\nImproved Flexibility\nA more significant number of enterprises from much broader geographic areas\nSupporting your Accelerator community, even during lockdowns\nLeveraging your workshop content to create a reusable library\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nBloom Digital Library\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nWhat Have We Learned Running Our Acceleration Program Fully Online in the Past 5 Years?\n\nFacilitation for Amazing Online and Offline Experiences\nPeople learn through doing, practicing, and sharing. People also know best when they’re having fun! When they’re engaged and happy. \nCritical Aspects of Facilitation \nThe same care for organizing an offline event should go into managing an online event, whether as small as a meeting with a few people or as big as a major conference or demo day. \nThe medium is the message. A well-planned and well-facilitated event can have more engagement and impact than a poorly planned or facilitated event. \nCreate Bridges Between the Physical and the Virtual\nPlay games and pass items back and forth between screens \nShare tea, coffee, or a meal while on a call \nMake a gift box of friendly perks/treats/tools to help them in the accelerator, and things to do fun games/activities with: \nInspirational items (posters, notebooks, magnets, etc.)  \nShirts, hats, or something to wear \nClown noses or fun items (in wrapping that disguises what they are until use) \nTools for activities, such as printouts of frameworks, post-its, pens, activity cards, etc.\nStretching exercises, especially after having been at the laptop for more than half an hour.\nSharing music: In each session, let a participant choose the session’s background music\nWhiteboard: share the whiteboard before the session begins and ask each participant to share a motivational quote/message.\nSimple Tips for Increasing Engagement Online \nEye contact: Look at the camera (not the screen) when talking, especially when recording something \nThe background: Something nice? Art? Outdoors? Inspiring? A banner with logos? \nSound: Use a better mic if possible, definitely headphones. Make sure nothing is rubbing against the microphone or mic cable while talking. \nAppearance: Try to be as “close to in-person” as possible … What are you wearing? Try not to wear big headphones. \nStand up when talking (it changes body language and energy).\nMute yourself whenever you’re not speaking to avoid interrupting the speaker\nMake sure your Zoom name is adjusted and has your team/organization/role in it as well\n\n"

              "content": "# Bloom Assessment Framework: Integrated Growth Approach\n\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **Integration Over Separation**\n- Personal and professional growth are interconnected parts of the entrepreneurial journey\n- Assessment should mirror this natural integration rather than artificially separate them\n- Every business milestone has both personal and organizational implications\n\n2. **Growth Over Measurement**\n- Focus on capturing progression rather than before/after snapshots\n- Embrace the journey of deepening understanding\n- Recognize that increased awareness may initially appear as decreased confidence\n\n3. **Action Over Analysis**\n- Assessments should directly inform action steps\n- Every insight should link to specific resources and opportunities\n- Measurement should serve development, not just documentation\n\n4. **Community Over Individual**\n- Growth happens in context of peers, mentors, and ecosystem\n- Assessment should capture both individual and collective progress\n- Learning from others' journeys enriches personal development\n\n## The New Approach\n\n### 1. ECAT as the Central Framework\n- ECAT becomes the primary lens through which we view development\n- Personal and universal competencies are mapped to relevant ECAT elements\n- Well-being indicators are integrated into organizational capacity measures\n\n### 2. Progressive Depth Model\nInstead of pre/post measurements, we track four levels of understanding:\n1. **Awareness** - Recognition of the element's importance\n2. **Understanding** - Grasp of how it applies to their context\n3. **Integration** - Active application in business operations\n4. **Mastery** - Ability to teach and guide others\n\n### 3. Real-time Growth Capture\nWeekly touchpoints include:\n- Power moves documentation\n- Learning moment reflection\n- Peer feedback integration\n- Mentor observations\n\n### 4. Development Portfolio\nTeams build evidence of growth through:\n- Documented \"aha moments\"\n- Applied learning examples\n- Impact stories\n- Community contributions\n\n## Implementation Framework\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Mapping (Week 1)\n- Complete streamlined ECAT\n- Identify priority development areas\n- Set learning objectives\n- Match with relevant resources\n\n### Phase 2: Weekly Rhythm (Weeks 2-11)\n- Monday: Power move planning\n- Wednesday: Peer learning session\n- Friday: Reflection and documentation\n- Monthly: Deep dive review\n\n### Phase 3: Growth Portfolio (Weeks 12-16)\n- Curate evidence of development\n- Document key transformations\n- Capture community impact\n- Plan ongoing growth\n\n## Measurement Integration\n\n### Personal Growth Indicators\n- Well-being elements mapped to business outcomes\n- Universal skills demonstrated through business actions\n- Character strengths applied to leadership challenges\n\n### Professional Growth Indicators\n- Business milestone achievement\n- Team capacity development\n- Resource utilization effectiveness\n- Market impact measures\n\n### Community Growth Indicators\n- Peer support contributions\n- Knowledge sharing\n- Ecosystem engagement\n- Collective learning moments\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n\n1. **For Teams**\n- Clearer development pathway\n- More actionable insights\n- Better integration of personal and professional growth\n- Stronger community connection\n\n2. **For Program Managers**\n- Streamlined assessment process\n- More meaningful progress tracking\n- Better resource allocation\n- Clearer impact demonstration\n\n3. **For Stakeholders**\n- More holistic view of impact\n- Better understanding of value creation\n- Clearer connection between personal and organizational growth\n- Stronger evidence base for support\n\n## Critical Questions for Implementation\n\n1. **Standardization Challenge**\nHow can we ensure consistent interpretation of depth levels across different mentors and programs while maintaining the nuanced understanding needed for personal development?\n\n2. **Evidence Reliability**\nIn moving away from traditional pre/post measurements, how do we rigorously demonstrate program impact to stakeholders who may be accustomed to more conventional metrics?\n\n3. **Resource Requirements**\nDoes this more integrated, continuous assessment approach actually reduce administrative burden, or does it simply shift it to different points in the program?\n\n4. **Scalability Concerns**\nHow well will this framework scale across different contexts, cultures, and program sizes? What elements might need to be modular or adaptable?\n\n5. **Integration Complexity**\nWhile the integrated approach makes theoretical sense, how do we ensure we're not losing valuable insights by combining previously separate measurements into one framework?",

Priority Area Goal Templates\n\n## Structure for Goal Setting\nWhen teams select a priority area, prompt them to complete:\n\n```markdown\n1. What we'll improve:\n\"We will strengthen [business area] by developing our [specific capacity]\"\n\n2. How we'll grow:\n\"Our team will build [personal/team capacity] through [specific practice]\"\n\n3. Success looks like:\n\"We'll know we've succeeded when [business indicator] and [team indicator]\"\n\nExample:\nPriority Area: Customer Discovery\n\n1. What we'll improve:\n\"We will strengthen our customer understanding by developing our interview and analysis capability\"\n\n2. How we'll grow:\n\"Our team will build empathy and listening skills through structured interview practice and reflection\"\n\n3. Success looks like:\n\"We'll know we've succeeded when we have 20 validated customer insights and the team is confidently conducting independent interviews\"\n```\n\n## Monthly Check-in Prompt\n```markdown\n1. Business Progress:\n- Key milestone achieved:\n- Current challenge:\n- Next priority:\n\n2. Team Growth:\n- New capability:\n- Learning moment:\n- Support needed:\n\n3. Resources Used:\n- Activities completed:\n- Tools helpful:\n- Additional needs:\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n1. **Assessment Timing**:\n- Initial assessment: Beginning of program\n- Progress reflection: Monthly\n- Deep review: Quarterly\n\n2. **Dashboard Updates**:\n- Weekly: Quick progress notes\n- Monthly: Detailed reflection\n- Quarterly: Stage progression\n\n3. **Priority Area Focus**:\n- Select 1-2 areas at a time\n- Review every month\n- Adjust based on progress\n\n4. **Evidence Collection**:\n- Activity completion\n- Resource utilization\n- Team reflections\n- Mentor feedback",

How do we measure both personal and organizational growth without overwhelming teams?\n2. How can we better capture progress without traditional pre/post testing?\n3. How do we maintain assessment value while streamlining the process?\n\n## Potential Paths Forward\n\n### Path 1: Progressive Growth Model\n- Move from point-in-time measurement to journey tracking\n- Focus on capturing growth moments and evidence\n- Link personal and organizational development naturally\n\n### Path 2: Integrated Framework Evolution\n- Build on ECAT as core framework\n- Find ways to incorporate personal elements\n- Streamline measurement points\n\n### Path 3: Simplified Assessment + Rich Documentation\n- Reduce formal assessment burden\n- Enhance natural growth documentation\n- Focus on quality over quantity of measurement\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. Program Goals\n   - Impact demonstration\n   - Team development\n   - Research validity\n\n2. Practical Constraints\n   - Current software capabilities\n   - Program structure\n   - Resource limitations\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Identify priority path\n2. Experiment with specific elements\n3.

Maintain core ECAT structure\n2. Enhance reflection capture\n3. Better integrate personal elements\n4. Improve mentor utilization\n\n### Medium-term\n1. Refine measurement approach\n2. Strengthen framework integration\n3. Enhance self-serve capabilities\n4. Develop better progress indicators\n\n### Long-term Vision\n1. Validated measurement tools\n2. Seamless personal/professional integration\n3. Enhanced impact demonstration\n4. Stronger ecosystem alignment\n\n## Discussion Points\n1. How might we better capture growth without compromising validity?\n2. What's the minimum effective assessment framework?\n3. How do we balance standardization with personalization?\n4. What quick wins could we implement for the next program?",

To align more with the goal of our programs to develop entrepreneurial skills and mindsets and to target a more appropriate age group, we are shifting towards other assessments, particularly looking at EntreComp from the EU. While Skills Builder and EntreComp (EC) suffer from a lack of universality, the EU's resources behind EC make it compelling. \nThe EU has initiated a project called ECI, EntreComp Implementation, specifically designed to address the implementation gap. We use their implementation suggestion to focus on a subset of the EntreComp.\n\n“Recognition precedes knowledge.” \n- Axel Honneth\n\nThis guiding quote inspires the decision to develop a public learning pathway, what Bloom used to call the leaderboard, to help people recognize the learnings and select their growth paths. To do this “out loud,” we are starting to explore public badging systems that allow people to see pathways, take assessments, and earn credentials they can keep with them forever after the program. (with no development on our part). \nSee: \nEntreComp-Badges-Recognising-Entrepreneurial-Practice.pdf\nfor more information. We will explore cheap/free platforms this week to use during ACSI3.\n\nAssessment Design and Considerations\nWe are proposing assessments to help learning happen. To recognize and incentivize - rather than “detect” - as some assessments attempt to do. As Bloom, we aim to promote entrepreneurial mindsets while training entrepreneurial skills. Developing a buffet-style assessment and intervention approach helps encourage engaged self-authored minds versus a more traditional scoring approach: “You are a C, here’s how you become a B, do XYZ.”\nThus, we propose three badging levels associated with three assessment styles.\n(Explorer) Awareness: Taking the assessment without any reflection to understand where they stand (Everyone who does the mentimeter/other collaborative survey tool).\nReflection: Taking the assessment and sharing a reflection.\nValidation: Taking the assessment and sharing a link to their actual work.\n\nThey can be three separate assessments or three assessments where two questions (reflection and validation) are optional.\n\nAwareness:\nWe want people to be aware of the full extent of the competency while not overwhelming them with complexity. This short test should be fast/fun and support realizing what skills it takes to be an entrepreneur. \nThe criteria we chose for the assessment questions are:\nRelevance to Competency: Questions must directly relate to the core aspects of the competency they aim to assess.\nPractical/Fact-based: Questions that expose the underlying competency yet are written and easily answerable by yes/no questions.\nDepth of Insight: The ability of questions to elicit responses demonstrating a deep understanding and application of the competency.\nProgression and Complexity: A mix of questions ranging from basic understanding to advanced application and strategic thinking.\nClarity and Conciseness: Questions should be clear, direct, and easily understood to avoid ambiguity and ensure accurate responses.\nWe chose two question types: T/F and Likert-scale. We do not believe this is the ideal question type, yet it’s a good start and will be fun. \nThe scale-based questions have challenges; for example, some people will never put a 5, and some put 3s down without much thought. \nThe T/F based on more concrete(potentially observable) elements can help resolve this. The challenge now becomes, what if people put T all the way across? \nOne suggestion is to tell people at the start: “No one ever gets 100% taking this assessment; that would mean nothing to learn. Be honest, and let’s use this to find our learning adventure together.”\nTaking this assessment unlocks the “EntreComp Explorer” badge. \nReflection: \nThis assessment follows the same structure as the first, except rather than T/F, participants are encouraged to write reflections on the EntreComp competencies they are learning about in the program. The reflection process is where the learning from the program is deepened and owned by the learner. Participants are encouraged to identify Entrepreneurial Skills within themselves and each other. Everyone is encouraged and welcomed to badge others when they recognize someone displaying a skill. \nLearners who take the reflection are valorized by a PM(or AI engine), indicating depth of thinking, identifying growth areas, selecting growth activities, and reflecting on growth activities completed.\n\nIn this phase, PMs and learners can badge each other. \n\nValidation:\n\nValidation happens throughout the rest of the time in the program. As learners perform activities and participants create valuable content, PMs can validate their competencies with actual “portfolio pieces” that can be baked into their learning badge. \nThis means that their badge will contain evidence of the Entrepreneurial competency it indicates.\n\nThe design of the assessment is likely to be two assessments. First, a T/F exploratory assessment mapping the territory. This is followed by an assessment of optional reflection questions and places to provide evidence (Google Docs, loom videos, testimonial blocks of text from customers, etc). The evidence we can accept for each competence already has a first draft proposal in the “Assessment Task/Activity” column of the “EntreComp Observable Activities” sheet on this spreadsheet: Individual Pillar Assessments and Questions.\n\nA request: I would like this second assessment to have a new question type, one that has a ranking (move a slider from 0-5), and once the slider lands, a text field is unlocked with the number and a short text. You chose 4. Why do you think you’re a 4 in creativity? Reflect on this competency …. And then we include some reflection prompting.\n\nReasoning\nSome of the thinking behind this structure is to:\nKeep entrepreneurs in the driver's seat\nSolve the issue of “slippage” - where funders see people scoring lower after a program due to their awareness about the skill increasing.\nIncrease engagement and involvement with participants by\nHelping them see a map of the territory\nEncouraging them to recognize skills within themselves and each other\nGiving them the “power” to give informal badges, increasing the fun/gamification elements of our programs\nTo create verifiable skill badges, we can share them with our funders rather than the arbitrariness of 100 teams, which went from 4.2 to 4.3 in our assessment of a self-reported skill. \nFunders see 100 people got this badge, which you can see on bloom.pm/allbadges: \nthis badge means XYZ; \nThese are the names of the people that got this badge; \nHere is the evidence they provided that was validated by their PM (for formal badges). \nWe can even have a bloom.pm/communityBadges where people can see the informal badges.\nTo make the first assessment useful, fast, and fun to do. Creating a framing for the rest of the program.\n\nSelf Critique and Suggestions\nWhile this reasoning makes sense. I, Bilal, am still not 100% convinced that we should use EntreComp for our skills framework. \nThere are cool reasons to do so; for instance, there was a mapping from these skills to roles within the ESCO (ESCO is the multilingual classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) Framework. You can find that in this PDF: ESCO-vs-EntreComp-Annex.pdf\nFor example, EntreComp framework and jobs that are related to them.  \n\nWhile EntreComp has been out since 2016 (I think), it’s not gaining traction. It’s getting some research, but not a lot. Most of what’s happening is because the EU throws $ at it. It’s not taking off, and there’s not a lot of energy behind it. Most projects I saw developing things on/for it are dead, and their URLs are not renewed. \n\nThe EU is doubling down on these “Comps,” though. I have two new ones that I would like to explore after proposing this framework and assessment approach. One is the GreenComp, and the other is LifeComp. \nLifeComp seems to be the most likely candidate for what we initially set out to do: replace the SkillsBuilder Universal Skills framework. We decided to focus on the entrepreneurial element - yet that may overlap with our EntCap assessment, especially as this assessment goes into the more practical elements. \n\nI’d love your feedback on these critiques and thoughts on making our assessments faster, more social, useful, more verifiable, less arbitrary, less self-reported, and most importantly, fun! \n\nOne last bonus element to using EntreComp: this PDF has a nice guide and activities to develop each skill. So we quickly have some nice things for our library: \nExample for researching potential business opportunities:\n\nEntreComp-Europe-Pocket-Book-for-Aspiring-Entrepreneurs.pdf\nFrom the forward to the LifeComp PDF linked above.\n\nFor “pre-entrepreneurs,” - I believe working with things like LifeComp is important. Before you can build entrepreneurial skills, the LifeComp skills are, as the EU forward says, the baseline. They are:\nWithout some of these fundamentals, for instance, learning how to manage learning, flexibility (coachability is one of our criteria for selection), critical thinking to help with reflection and choosing a learning path, growth-mindset to make sure it all works. We may be unable to support participants in our entrepreneurial programs. \n\nHow we want to go about this is interesting. A proposal that’s coming up for me is that for LifeComp, we may need a psychometric assessment/3rd party assessment or onboarding interviews that get analyzed. This will allow us to split people in our programs into two: one that goes into the LifeComp path to learn how to learn. And the others who hit a baseline level of competence here can join us in the EntreComp path.\n\nThank you for listening to my TED talk. \n+Bilal\nAfterward.\nYou can find the Leadership for Entrepreneurship assessments below.

              "content": "# Growth Journey: Integrated Solutions\n\n## 1. Growth Journey Map Integration\n\n**Solution**: Create a three-layer growth map that mirrors tree growth:\n\n**Roots** (LifeComp - Foundational Skills)\n- Learning to learn\n- Resilience development\n- Critical thinking\n- Basic self-awareness\n\n**Trunk** (EntreComp - Core Growth)\n- Business fundamentals\n- Leadership development\n- Resource management\n- Implementation skills\n\n**Branches/Fruit** (Outcomes)\n- Business metrics\n- Impact measures\n- Team development\n- Personal flourishing\n\n## 2. Badge System for Growth Tracking\n\n**Solution**: Use badges to mark growth stages rather than absolute measures:\n\n**Root Badges** (Foundation)\n- \"Soil Explorer\" - Basic awareness\n- \"Root Builder\" - Applied learning skills\n- \"Growth Ready\" - Demonstrated readiness\n\n**Trunk Badges** (Development)\n- \"Sprout\" - Initial implementation\n- \"Grower\" - Consistent application\n- \"Cultivator\" - Teaching others\n\n**Fruit Badges** (Achievement)\n- \"First Harvest\" - Initial outcomes\n- \"Abundant Growth\" - Sustained results\n- \"Seed Spreader\" - Ecosystem impact\n\nThis addresses Dunning-Kruger by:\n- Celebrating increased awareness as progress\n- Focusing on evidence rather than self-perception\n- Creating positive framing for deeper understanding\n\n## 3. Minimum Viable Evidence\n\n**For Roots** (LifeComp):\n- Learning reflection logs\n- Peer feedback documentation\n- Applied learning examples\n\n**For Trunk** (EntreComp):\n- Implementation documentation\n- Resource utilization examples\n- Team development evidence\n\n**For Fruit** (Outcomes):\n- Business metrics\n- Impact documentation\n- Stakeholder testimonials\n\n## 4. Framework Alignment While Prioritizing Experience\n\n**Solution**: Layer frameworks naturally:\n\n1. **Entry Point**:\n- Simple awareness assessment\n- Growth journey visualization\n- Clear next steps\n\n2. **Development Path**:\n- Framework elements introduced progressively\n- Evidence collected through natural work\n- Alignment shown through outcomes\n\n3. **Documentation**:\n- Auto-collected evidence where possible\n- Integration with existing workflows\n- Natural connection to EU frameworks\n\n## 5. LifeComp as Roots Assessment\n\n**Yes, because**:\n1. Provides foundation for growth\n2. Identifies readiness for advanced work\n3. Shows clear development pathway\n\n**Implementation**:\n- Initial quick assessment\n- Ongoing development support\n- Clear progression markers\n\n## Practical Implementation\n\n1. **Program Start**:\n- Quick LifeComp check\n- Growth journey mapping\n- Initial badge earning\n\n2. **During Program**:\n- Weekly growth documentation\n- Monthly reflection points\n- Badge progression\n\n3. **Program End**:\n- Portfolio compilation\n- Impact documentation\n- Future growth planning\n\n## Benefits for Stakeholders\n\n**Teams**:\n- Clear growth pathway\n- Meaningful recognition\n- Portable credentials\n\n**Program Managers**:\n- Simplified tracking\n- Clear progress markers\n- Framework alignment\n\n**Funders**:\n- Verifiable progress\n- Clear impact measures\n- Framework alignment\n\n## Key Success Metrics\n\n1. **Engagement**:\n- Badge completion rates\n- Evidence quality\n- Peer recognition\n\n2. **Growth**:\n- Stage progression\n- Capability development\n- Outcome achievement\n\n3. **Impact**:\n- Business results\n- Personal development\n- Ecosystem contribution",
