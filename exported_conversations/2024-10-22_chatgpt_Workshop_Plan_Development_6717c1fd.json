Keep the focus on Iraq - aligning with the paris accords, etc, not on european elements (eu sustainable finance plan, green bonds that are probably not available in iraq, also green finance and green loans are probably not yet available)remove microcredits section and socially responsible investing. these are young people going into technical vocation and needing to manage their budgets and understand how to sell by convincing people of the long term financial economic benefit of being more sustainable/green in their housing with thermal insulation or solar panels. So they need to be able to run those numbers, not invest in a social enterprise.

What are these ‘other assets’? \nI’ve never seen a whole map of all the different types of \n‘valuable resources’. In Permaculture: A Designers’ Manual, \nBill Mollison offers and expands on a categorization of assets \nbased on their potential: Degenerative, Generative, Pro\u0002creative, Informational, Conservative.1 These always seem like \na good way to think about things, but I don’t use them in \nany tangible way.\nI wanted something that would be more helpful for under\u0002standing the complex transactions and exchanges swirling \naround me as a human being and us as a global community. \nAs I tried to enumerate all of the different ‘valuable resources’ \nwhich an individual or entity could gather or exchange in a \ncommunity, the ‘Eight Forms of Capital’ emerged (Figure 1).\nSocial Capital\nInfluence and connections are social capital. A person or entity \nwho has ‘good social capital’ can ask favors, influence decisions \nand communicate efficiently. Social capital is of primary \nimportance in politics, business and community organizing. \nJason Eaton of Social Thread LLC explained to me that \ncapital can be in the form of equity or debt. In social capital, \na person can ‘owe’ favors or decision-making influence to \nanother person or entity.\nMaterial Capital\nNon-living physical objects form material capital. Raw and \nprocessed resources like stone, metal, timber, and fossil fuels \nare ‘complexed’ with each other to create more sophisticated \nmaterials or structures. Modern buildings, bridges, and other \npieces of infrastructure along with tools, computers and other \ntechnologies are complexed forms of material capital.\nFinancial Capital\nWe are most familiar with financial \ncapital: money, currencies, secur\u0002ities and other instruments of \nthe global financial system. The \ncurrent global society focuses \nenormous amounts of attention on \nfinancial capital. It is our primary \ntool for exchanging goods and \nservices with other humans. It can \nbe a powerful tool for oppression, \nor (potentially) liberation.\nLiving Capital\nA precious metal dealer who atten\u0002ded both Financial Permaculture \ncourses advises, “Rather than US \n58 permaculture\t permaculture\t No. 68 www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk No. 68 permaculture permaculture 59\nFinancial & Community Design\nValuing more \nthan money\nSpiritual\nLiving\nFinancial\nMateria\nS\nl\nocial\ndollars, measure your wealth in ounces [of gold and silver]!” \nRecognizing that ‘precious’ metals are just another form \nof financial capital, Catherine Austin Fitts recommends that \nwe diversify and, “Measure your wealth in ounces, acres, and \nhooves”. Living capital is made up of the animals, plants, water \nand soil of our land – the true basis for life on our planet.\nPermaculture design teaches us the principles and practices \nfor the rapid creation of living capital. Permaculture encour\u0002ages us to share the abundance of living capital rather than \nthe intangible ‘wealth’ of financial capital.\n(Note: ‘Natural Capital’ could be a synonym for living \ncapital, but the 1999 book, Natural Capitalism, by Hawken \net al. focuses more on a slightly updated system of capitalism \nthan on the true wealth of living systems. The current Slow \nMoney movement is also making strides in a similar direction, \nseeking to transfer financial capital into the living forms of \nsoil, animals, and agriculture.)\nIntellectual Capital\nIntellectual capital is best described as a ‘knowledge’ asset. \nThe majority of the current global education system is focused \non imparting intellectual capital – whether or not it is the \nmost useful form of capital for creating resilient and thriving \ncommunities. Having intellectual capital is touted as the \nsurest way to ‘be successful’. Science and research can focus \non obtaining intellectual capital or ‘truth’, though it is often \nmotivated by the desire for financial or social capital. For \nexample, ‘going to university’ is primarily an exchange of \nfinancial capital for intellectual capital. It is supposed to \nprepare people for the rest of their lives in the world. \nExperiential (or Human) Capital\nWe accumulate experiential capital through actually organizing \na project in our community, or building a strawbale house, or \ncompleting a permaculture design. The most effective way \nto learn anything comes through a blended gathering of \nintellectual and experiential capital. My personal experience \ngetting a Master’s degree at Gaia University showed me that \nexperiential learning is essential for my effective functioning \nin the world: I was able to do projects instead of take classes, \nand I’m now collaboratively organizing the local permaculture \nguild and co-running a successful permaculture design firm.2\nI can see that human capital is a combination of social, \nintellectual and experiential capital – all facets of a person that \ncan be gathered and carried in essentially limitless amounts. \nBut there’s one more form of capital that a person can gather \nand carry inside themselves...\nSpiritual Capital\nSpiritual capital contains aspects of intellectual and experiential \ncapital, but is deeper, more personal and less quantifiable. \nMost of the world’s religions include a concept of ‘the great \nchain of being’, a holarchic understanding of existence where \nspiritual attainment (in this context, the accumulation of \nspiritual capital) leads to different levels of being.3\nIn spiritual capital, there again enters the concept that \ncapital can be in the form of equity (gathering positive spiritual \nexperience/understanding/attainment) OR in the form of debt. \nIn some Mayan cultures (like the Tzutujil of Lago Atitlan), \na basic understanding of existence is that humans owe a \n‘spiritual debt’ to the magnificent beauty and complexity of \nexistence. According to this worldview, the goal of one’s life \nin the world is to create works of unspeakable beauty and \ngratitude, thereby repaying the spiritual debt to existence.4\nThe Tzutujil also recognize that single human beings can never \nreally be effective at gathering and flowing capital if they are \nseparated from their community.\nCultural Capital\nAll the other forms of capital may be held and owed by \nindividuals, but cultural capital can only be gathered by a \ncommunity of people. Cultural capital describes the shared \ninternal and external processes of a community – the works \nof art and theater, the songs that every child learns, the ability \nto come together in celebration of the harvest or for a religious \nholiday. Cultural capital cannot be gathered by individuals \nalone. It could be viewed as an emergent property of the \ncomplex system of inter-capital exchanges that takes place \nin a village, a city, a bioregion, or nation (Figure2 overleaf). \nProperties of the System\nThese eight forms of capital help us map our understanding \nof the world. The map clarifies that money is not the only \nform of capital flowing around and through us. This map \nexpands the concepts of wealth (and poverty) to include the \n‘valuable resources’ of personal connections, natural resources, \n60 permaculture\t permaculture\t No. 68 www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk No. 68 permaculture permaculture 61\nFigure 3\nFinancial & Community Design\nFigure 2\nland, knowledge, experience, and \nmore. It provides a language for \npermaculture designers to com\u0002municate the value of healthy soil \nand healthy communities to people \nimmersed in the current mindset \nof global capitalism, where finan\u0002cial capital is the only reality.\nWhat are the mediums of \nexchange used for each form \nof capital?\nEight Forms of Currency\nAlthough most definitions of \ncurrency focus on financial capital, \nthe Oxford American Dictionary\nand the Princeton Wordnet5 both \ninclude the definition of “the \nfact or quality of being generally \naccepted or in use”. For this map, I define a currency as the \ngenerally accepted (or in use) medium of exchange between \npools of capital. In many cases, the currency is the capital itself \n– for example, items of ‘material capital’ like copper or steel, \ncan be the medium of exchange. Currencies can also be ‘comp\u0002lexed’ into more interconnected and functional forms and still \nused as a medium of exchange (Figure 3).\nPractical Applications\nEarlier this year, as my partner and I designed a four-weekend \nseries of Forest Garden courses, we were having a lot of trouble \nwith the budget. The costs of renting space and paying teachers \ncombined with our desire to keep fees affordable for the local \ncommunity made the numbers look unfeasible. No matter how \nwe changed things around, we couldn’t figure out how to make \na reasonable financial return. Then we realized that our thinking \nwas too narrow – we were only looking at financial capital! \nWhen we considered the experiential capital we’d gain by \nrunning a course, the social capital gathered by planting forest \ngardens at a new education center, and the living capital of \nhundreds of useful plants going into the ground... it became \nclear that financial remuneration was only one facet of the \nsystem. Nonetheless, we still needed to balance our inflow and \noutflow of this one form of capital.\nThe eight forms of capital provide a clear path towards \na small point of great leverage: Eco-social Investing. We \ncan encourage individuals, businesses, organizations, and \ngovernments to mimic nature’s practices of investing: locally, \nintimately, diversely, and primarily in living capital. The \nFinancial Permaculture community, Gaia University, and \na host of connected businesses and organizations are invest\u0002ing diverse baskets of capital, offering events like the Carbon \nFarming Course in Tennessee and the thriving eco-social \nchocolate business, BooyaCacao.\nI’ve outlined a set of principles for Eco-Social and Ecosystem \nInvesting, which you can find on my blog.\nOne of the most useful applications of this map is for \ngrowing and shifting our own understanding of the world and \nthe transactions we engage in. When I volunteer time working \non my friend’s organic permaculture farm, more than just \n‘free labor’ is taking place:\n◗ I’m gaining experiential and intellectual capital about the \nfarm’s soil, crops, and management.\n◗ We’re supporting the growth of healthy living capital \nin the soil.\n◗ My friend gets help producing\nproducts to exchange for \nfinancial capital (her right \nlivelihood).\n◗ We both build social capital\nthrough positive interaction\nand connection with each\nother.\nThis amount of clarity can lead \nto a whole new level of trans\u0002parency in our work as eco-social\u0002cultural-economic designers. It \ncan guide us towards an ever\u0002deepening practice of the third \nethic of permaculture.\n60 permaculture\t permaculture\t No. 68 www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk No. 68 permaculture permaculture 61\nFinancial & Community Design\nThe Third Ethic\nAlthough Bill Mollison originally stated the third ethic of \npermaculture as “Setting limits to population and consumption”,6\nmany of us (especially in the more recent waves of permaculture) \nhave been taught different forms of the third ethic. Some learn \n‘Fair Share’, a toned-down and friendlier version of ‘Limits’. \nOthers learn ‘Resource Share’, which directs attention away \nfrom scarcity and towards reinvestment of abundance. And \nmore recently I’ve seen Starhawk refer to the third ethic as \n‘Future Care’, which synthesizes the call for Fair Share and \nResource Share into a focus on creating thriving inheritances \nfor future generations. The eight forms of capital can and should \nbe considered in terms of each version of the third ethic.\nFair Share\nWhen people, and the businesses, organizations and govern\u0002ments, understand the eight forms of capital, they may find \nthat financial capital is not the whole system. This can lead to \ndecreased consumption of non-essential goods and services \nthat fuel our infinite-growth-based financial system. \nA truly just society requires fair and equitable distribution \nof all forms of capital. While financial capital is important, \nnon-financial capitals offer pathways to empowerment for the \noppressed communities of our planet. In communities I’ve \nvisited (Kazakhstan, Chile, and Latin America), the abundance \nof cultural capital often outweighs the financial capital, \nregenerating into a wealth of experiential and living capital that \nI’ve never seen in my north-eastern USA home. Any of us in the \nover-developed world can follow this modeling, working to end \noppression caused by our current financial-capital-centric systems.\nResource Share\nWe can use the eight forms of capital to include resource \nsharing in our projects. AppleSeed Permaculture has set a new \nCarbon Policy, whereby 5% of our revenues will be dedicated \nto offsetting our carbon footprint through carbon-farming \nprojects (living capital). The Permaculture Activist’s tree tax \nfunctions in much the same way, transforming financial capital \ninto living capital for the good of the planet.\nAppleSeed Permaculture is also inspired by our friends \nShabazz and Josephine of Greenway Environmental Services, \nwho explicitly donate 10% of every work week back to the \ncommunity through education and consulting. They share \ntheir intellectual and experiential capital with urban youth \ngroups and rural permaculturists alike, generating social \ncapital for themselves at the same time.\nFuture Care\nTo care for future generations, we need to move beyond \nfinance into living and cultural capital. Of all eight forms, these \ntwo have the greatest potential for positive systemic change. \nMollison writes, “We should develop or create wealth just as \nwe develop landscapes, by conserving energy and natural \nresources [and] by developing procreative assets (proliferating \nforests, prairies, and life systems)”.7 Only through the songs, \nstories, and shared ethics of cultural capital can a focus on living \ncapital can be sustained for the seventh generation to come.\nSome pieces are missing from the map: where does ‘labor’ fit \ninto the picture? What form of capital is ‘time’? There may \nbe some dangerous implications: this map could commodify \necosystem services, spirituality, and culture. To care for the \nfuture, we must think more holistically about our current \ncapital system. So let this map be a first draft\nEthan C Roland is a permaculture designer, teacher, and eco\u0002social entrepreneur based in the Hudson river valley of New \nYork, USA.
