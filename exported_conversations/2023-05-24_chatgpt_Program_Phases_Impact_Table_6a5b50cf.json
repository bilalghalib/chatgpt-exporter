Through the current approach, the program has identified a strong pool of viable projects at different stages of development that leverage technology and innovation to find solutions to current challenges within their communities. \n\nThe Outreach Phase was launched on September 26, 2022, and concluded on October 26, 2022, with the application deadline. During the outreach phase, we conducted a series of five Open House events in addition to social media marketing of the program. The Open House series was attended by an average of 30 participants per session, reaching out to participants from diverse geographical backgrounds who engaged and shared their interest in the program. \n\nThe Sprint Phase was launched on November 7, 2022, and concluded on November 22, 2022, with the Sprint Demo Day. The Sprint allowed us to understand further the teams' readiness for the program and qualification. During the Sprint, teams showcased their competitive edge and shared their thoughts about possible areas of improvement. We report the details of the Sprint Phase in the mid-program report submitted on January 2023 to the Asfari Foundation, while this report covers the remaining program period.\n\nThe Accelerator Phase was launched on December 5, 2022, and concluded on May 2, 2023, with the Final Demo Day. During these four months, thirteen enterprises from Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine participated in the Accelerator Phase of the program. The enterprises were in their ideation or prototype stage and were looking to develop their ideas and prototypes into functioning business ideas. The Accelerator was designed to build the capacity of the enterprises through weekly training and mentorship facilitated by Bloom in partnership with the Asfari Foundation. The program utilized Bloom's online platform, training pedagogy, and networks of experts to deliver a customized curriculum that met the specific needs of each social enterprise. Over the course of the four-month accelerator, the participating enterprises received support and guidance in developing their business models, refining their value propositions, and identifying potential customers and market opportunities. They also received training on various topics, including financial management, marketing, and pitching.\n",

Customize the training curriculum based on the collected data. |\n| More networking and collaboration opportunities | Introduce regular virtual networking events or \"team building\" activities. Create a dedicated online space (like a forum or chat) where teams can share ideas and collaborate. |\n| Increase the number of mentors | Launch a mentor recruitment campaign to attract industry professionals interested in supporting startups. This could include partnerships with universities, corporations, or professional associations. |\n| Enhance the online platform | Seek feedback on the current platform's limitations and implement necessary upgrades or changes. Consider partnering with a tech company to optimize the platform for improved user experience and functionality. |\n| Additional resources for early-stage startups | Provide a toolkit or guide with resources specifically geared toward early-stage startups. This could include templates for business plans, marketing strategies, financial planning, etc. |\n| More structured goal-setting and progress tracking | Implement a systematic goal-setting process at the start of the program and regular check-ins to track progress. Utilize project management tools to visualize and monitor progress. |\n| In-person activities or events | If the pandemic situation allows, consider organizing periodic in-person meetups or workshops. Alternatively, small, local meetups could be arranged if participants are geographically dispersed. |\n\nThese are broad suggestions and may need to be further tailored to the specific needs and capabilities of your program.\n",
