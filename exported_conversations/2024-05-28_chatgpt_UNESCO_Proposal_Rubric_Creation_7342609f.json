UNESCO's mission is to contribute to the building of a culture of peace, the eradication of poverty, sustainable development and intercultural dialogue through education, the sciences, culture, communication and information Peace must be built upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of humanity. In this spirit, UNESCO develops educational tools to help people live as global citizens free of hate and intolerance. UNESCO works to ensure that every child and every citizen has access to quality education \nUNESCO's vision\n\nPolitical and economic arrangements of governments are not enough to secure the lasting and sincere support of the peoples. Peace must be founded upon dialogue and mutual understanding. Peace must be built upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of humanity.\n\nIn this spirit, UNESCO develops educational tools to help people live as global citizens free of hate and intolerance. UNESCO works to ensure that every child and every citizen has access to quality education. By promoting cultural heritage and the equal dignity of all cultures, UNESCO strengthens the bonds between nations. UNESCO fosters scientific programmes and policies as platforms for development and cooperation. UNESCO stands up for freedom of expression, as a fundamental right and a key condition for democracy and development. As a laboratory of ideas, UNESCO helps countries to adopt international standards and manages programmes that foster the free flow of ideas and the exchange of knowledge.\n\nUNESCO's founding vision was born in response to a world war marked by racist and anti-Semitic violence. Seventy years later and many liberation struggles later, UNESCO’s mandate is more relevant than ever. Cultural diversity is under attack and new forms of intolerance, rejection of scientific facts and threats to freedom of expression challenge peace and human rights. In response, UNESCO's duty remains to reaffirm the humanist missions of education, science and culture.Culture and values\n\nLast update:21 September 2023\nThe way people value and perceive biodiversity influences behaviour at the level of the individual, institutions and whole societies. More work is needed to understand the diversity of values that people hold for biodiversity, especially among non-Western societies and marginalized groups. The different ways of perceiving and valuing biodiversity depend on culture, gender, education, occupation, context (e.g. urban/rural) and/or a multitude of other influences. There is growing recognition of the need to understand this issue.\n\nBiodiversity may be valued for the extrinsic ‘ecosystem services’ it provides to humanity (e.g. the provision of pollinators for food production, mangroves for preventing coastal erosion or plants as potential sources of new pharmaceuticals). It can also be regarded as having intrinsic value; for example, highly biodiverse areas such as rainforests or coral reefs, or charismatic animals such as tigers or whales, are often perceived to have value regardless of their contributions to people. Biodiversity and nature also have profound cultural and spiritual dimensions. However, these may conflict with systems that place an economic value on biodiversity.\n\nUnderstanding diverse values is essential to comprehending how humans interact with biodiversity.\nUnderstanding different values is also essential for gaining the consensus and cooperation needed to conserve biodiversity, which can only be achieved when multiple actors agree on common goals.\n \n\nBiodiversity and nature have profound cultural and spiritual dimensions\n Wetlands in Changbaishan Biosphere Reserve, China\nPan Wencheng / Changbaishan Biosphere Reserve\nUNESCO's role\nin understanding the diverse values of biodiversity\nUNESCO’s interdisciplinary mandate which includes the natural and social sciences and culture makes it uniquely able to explore the diverse values of nature. Biodiversity is central to many cultures and culture itself plays a crucial role in how biodiversity is perceived. UNESCO is the only UN agency with a mandate in the field of culture.\n\nThrough its culture conventions and programmes, UNESCO plays a unique role in promoting human creativity and safeguarding culture and heritage worldwide. UNESCO’s mandate for the social sciences enables exploration of the ethical considerations of nature’s intrinsic value, while  UNESCO’s  work  on  gender  provides  a  space  to  examine  how  biodiversity  is  experienced  and  utilized differently by women and men. Finally, the work of UNESCO in culture and communication and information demonstrates that language is key to how we understand and perceive the world, and shows how the concepts of ‘biodiversity’ and ‘nature’ are expressed in many different ways in different languages.\n\nIndigenous and local communities\nIndigenous peoples and local communities deserve special  attention  when  considering  the  diverse  values  of  nature.  Many  indigenous  and  local  communities  are  reliant  on  biodiversity  and  have  a  particular  relationship  with  their  landscapes  and  seascapes.  They  do  not  necessarily  see  a  distinction between humans and nature, and often accord  deeply  spiritual  importance  to  animals  and  plants.  Within  this  cultural  context,  efforts  to  put  an  economic  value  on  biodiversity  or  even  to  actively  manage  biodiversity  for  conservation  can be deemed highly offensive. Moreover, much of  Western  conservation  philosophy  perceives  a  clear separation between humans and nature, with human  impacts  on  biodiversity  automatically  seen  as  detrimental.  For  indigenous  peoples,  however,  human  interaction  with  nature  is  crucial  for  both  the natural and social worlds. Conservation actions that aim to limit human interactions with biodiversity may therefore risk severing indigenous connections to nature. Such diverse values need to be explored and  mutually  understood  if  conservation  activities  are to be acceptable and equitable for all. \n\n2, I'd like your help with that There are three I can propose:\n\n\nCall for speaker proposals: Good practices of using generative AI in teaching and learning\nUNESCO is calling for good practices of using generative AI (GenAI) in teaching and learning. Representatives of selected projects will be invited to speak at the 2024 edition of Digital Learning Week to be organized by UNESCO from 2 to 5 September at UNESCO HQ in Paris.\n\nThe UNESCO Guidance for generative AI in education and research was launched during the first edition of Digital Learning Week in September 2023. This Guidance was developed to foster well-designed practices of using generative AI in teaching and learning guided by a human-centred approach. The Guidance can be downloaded at the following link: Guidance for generative AI in education and research\n\nUNESCO is currently organizing the second edition of Digital Learning Week in 2024. One of the event's sub-themes will be centred around the sharing of experiences and lessons learned about the use of GenAI in teaching and learning. In this context, UNESCO is calling for speaker proposals from teachers, experts, and institutions on good practices of using GenAI in teaching and learning.
