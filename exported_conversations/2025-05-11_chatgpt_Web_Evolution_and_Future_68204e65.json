Web 2.0 leaned into consumerism, surveillance capitalism, and algorithmic curation, shaping the social web into a more profit-driven, data-extractive environment.\\n\\nLooking forward, a \"Web 4.0\" could return to the original principles of decentralization, but with a richer, more relational perspective.

Let's break it down a bit more deeply.\\n\\nThe early web was built on principles like decentralization, open standards, and universal access. These principles encouraged innovation and made it possible for anyone to contribute and connect. However, these same principles also made it ripe for commercialization. Once businesses realized the potential of the internet for profit, the open nature of the web allowed for the rapid growth of platforms that could centralize services, aggregate users, and monetize data at scale. Essentially, the same openness that fostered freedom also enabled monopolistic practices and the extraction of user data for profit.\\n\\nTo reorient the web into a civilizational technology, we might want principles like data sovereignty (ensuring individuals control their data), ethical design (prioritizing user well-being over engagement metrics), and decentralized governance (spreading out control so no single entity can dominate). These principles could create a more balanced, humane internet that serves as a foundation for collective growth rather than exploitation.\\n\\nIn short, the shift happened because the same open principles that allowed for freedom also allowed for exploitation.

So that's these are the.. It's a real challenge. Yeah. How can we come to some common agreement? And there is some clues, you know? It's clues? It's, uh evidence? Yeah, evidence.. You know? Um, when so many people hear the story of Mother Terea, they are moved. Hmm. Right? They are moved.. They're inspired.. That shows that you can do some triangulation. It's cross cultural. It's not so subjective. It's a common point of every culture, every languages, yeah. Yeah. And so when you when you're not just matter Teresa, but you see other personalities potentially.. And behaviors and events. Like, when burns. Yeah. The whole world Catholic people very hurt. And all of the donations that come when there's a big tsunami or earthquake. Anyway, even Morocco, Sri Lanka, people donate around the world. right? And so saying that moral life is subjective ignores this evidence, that there seems to be a cross cultural phenomenon happening. Yeah. And so really related to our condition of human. Hmm. Yeah. Basically, but how do you analyze this and put, like sched to, yeah, ask and also expose, basically what you were thinking about, like, yeah, I try to put more meaning between everyone. Yeah, despite of the differences of culturess and I know politicians, the difficult thing is to distinguish between emotions and inner knowledge. Because a politician will make emotions. They will say, these people will take your jobs. These people are murderers. be afraid, okay? And so people are emotional, and many people vote based on emotional manipulation.. Even positive manipulation. Make America great Again, we will build the best country, we'll go to the moon, or Mars, or, you know, and manipulates or effects, behavior, and voting, especially. And if we want democracies to work, we need voting to be inspired by meaningful choice. Yeah. So that's very hard to put on a scene now. Because of the way media works? Yeah. Especially social media.. really using this method. Yeah. Like Trump and all these guys.. But I think that people are tired, in general. Oh, yeah. Many people, they see the problems, they may be even manipulated, but they also realize at the same time, I can't hate my neighbors. I can't always have this anger and it's not working, you know. And so I'm just to come to this point, what you just say, what you just said, it's it's like a big step because I don't feel like people, especially in France, and maybe especially in the north of France. people are really angry. to everybody. Like, you go to event event a concert music or you go outside taking a drink in the city or you drive on the road. People are so angry and they want to. Yeah, like, maybe they're afraid and they want to keep their their comfort, their money, their quietness, you know, they don't want anybody to bother them or to change their habititude. And just to think about that and say, okay, I cannot be angry all the time, I cannot be angry to everybody, and we have to figure it out a solution. So so interesting because even if you think about something very silly things, there is still, I think, you tell me if I'm wrong, but some kind of anti German sentiment, maybe just on average. Let's say. German? Yeah, because of World War II. Oh, yeah. So let's say 50% would be completely neutral towards Germany. I'd say it's like 55%, where people are like,, they're okay, they're okay, but, you know, I think there is something like that in general. But not with with the German people, but yeah, Jewish, Muslim,. These are more active. There's some kind of racism. I chose Germany just because it's old, and it's almost gone, and it's because the grandparents probably felt it more. Maybe the great grandparents even more, you know, the ones that lived and saw the consequence of World War II and saw German soldiers in the streets and, you know, maybe they would have it more, and their kids, maybe a little less. And then us even less. Now we go to Berlin party. You know And the thing is, though, so I started with this question thinking about, is it possible to get to some kind of shared meaning that when someone is trying to convince people, they use, what is meaningful for them and tries to help people see that, rather than manipulating with emotions. And so what I but not just that, not just to have one topic or another topic, but to say there is. a true world that we can we can settle on, that's real, you know? That is not just stuff, that is also meaningful. And that in this meaningful world, it'll help us make better decisions on how to live together and to face the real challenges of our time, which is climate change, which is the transitions of our economies, which is potentially the sun exploding. Like, there are real problems, you know? And we are fighting between each other and getting more and more afraid of each other. And so I think part of it is related to how the nation state is developed. So it's a modern idea. It's 200 years old, this idea of Germany, France, you know. It's an experiment. You can't say that this is a a reality of the world. You look at a map, all those boundaries, that's modern, very modern. Not that, not ancient, not human. And so, so as democracy, and so is voting. And the question is, can we come with a way to help people preserve the identities in the cultures and even, this is something that is really difficult to understand, but it's true. Different cultures, experience reality differently. You know, how optical illusions is the is the dress blue and black or white and gold? There's more like that. But in general, like, you know, they say about Eastern cultures, they care about family, they care about cohesion, and Western cultures are more individualistic. And so when someone sees a group of people an Eastern person might think of the family's relationships. A Western person might think of, this person, that person, that person. So they literally see the world and interpret it differently. And so that's called, like, you can call it a philosophical stack. Stack? A stack, because there's multiple comp? There's components. Okay, yeah, yeah. So people live in a world with these components that are usually invisible to them. One is called ontology. What is real and what is not real? And one is called epistemology. How do you know things? You know? Yeah. And one is called Exiology, or teleology. It's like, what is teleios is the end, like at theelomers and that's DNA? What is the purpose of things? Where are things going? Why? Right? The purpose. And so the reason why I started looking into this is I was realizing like, you know, I want to help people accept the fact that we can perceive meaning and that that should inform how we decide things and how we even organize society according to not emotions or manipulation, but to how people actually want to live. You know? Yeah, that's interesting. And so, but the problem is. Not everyone believes that meaning is an ontological reality, that it is a real thing. People might say, that's just their subjective experience, that's just you know, noise, information, and so what I'm you know, experimenting with and trying to figure out is, can we take that intuition, that people around the world can love Mother Teresa? And that there's something in them that lights up that is not here.. I go out like this, right? And so.. the question is, can we find a way of doing science on the perception of the heart or on meaning perception? so that we can say that cross culturally, this is real. This is a meaningful and it's not abstract. And it's not because of this culture of that culture. So we need to, like, see the philoson. philosophical stacks, and then what I'm trying to do is come up with a bare minimum philosophical stack. Bear? The minimum one that everyone can agree with. Because right now, there's a lot of disagreements on ontology, exiology, and epistemology. This is why philosophers disagree. This is why there are so many philosophers. If it was just logic, there should be only one philosophy. But it's not just a logical set of arguments. Each argument implies something about how they see the world. I think it's a very hard work. You have been in. Yeah, when I'm making progress because like prove to these, like, basic thing we all have and despite of the cultures and the nationalities and everything, we can feel it and it's real and you want to prove it. I don't know. don't how. I think the thing is.. But I see. We won't prove that we.. It's not like we will identify it. We won't prove it.. Yeah, we won't like run an experiment and say, okay, we now know truth, what we will be able to say is, we've run an experiment and we know that truth exists, and that we are in a process towards truth.. We can't observe it. We only observe it through cross cultural patterns that show just like when you see a star going around another star, they found the black hole, because they couldn't see the black hole, but they observed the patterns of behavior, and they can say there's something there. They didn't even know what a black hole was. We still don't know exactly what a black hole is. But we see how it influences things, and we can say that it's real. Yeah. And similarly, I think this is what we're going to try to I'm trying to do with this project is to say, we might not be able to say, \"Meing is this neuron in your brain, \"and this neuron is trust and this neuron is honesty, and this neuron is But what we will be able to say is that meaning is real, and people can perceive it. And when they do these set of behaviors, they're more likely to, you know, identify what is meaningful for them and live a life with no regrets. Mm. Yeah. And not that we can know what is the meaning inside of a you know, very specifically, we won't be able to point that truth and say, \"This is true, this is reality, but we can say, there is a base reality, and that is in the subjective domain, or in the nonmaterial domain, you know? Just like we infer things about the material world, using our observation of sight, sound, hearing, you know, we take the telescope, we see stars circling, we say a black hole. I think that if we formalize inner observation, somehow, find a way of saying,This isn't an emotion, this is inner knowledge.\" And we do it cross culturally with hundreds of thousands of people, we will be able to start to see the black holes and the other non visible, real things, by their patterns across cultures. You know, I loved that our politicians would listen and hmm act, as a philosophers and scient scientists, advised them. what to do. in that goal, you must have like general agreement, you know, between all of the countries ands that's. I, this is why it has to be a science, and this is why I'm trying to convince, you know, scientists. I'm not trying to convince vegans and hippies, you know? Yeah. I'm trying to convince, the scientific community that we're neglecting something very important because they do listen. There are political scientists, there are policy briefs, there are many organizations, and they all have reasons, right? The axiology, right? But they don't have the ability to say why they have these reasons. So the people that are encouraging countries towards closing their borders, they may be thinking, okay, so climate change is real, we're gonna have a bunch of climate refugees in 15 years around the world. And if we keep our borders open today and then try to close them in 15 years, it's gonna be crazy. So we need to start making it difficult to immigrate now so that when the climate crisis hits in this severe way, and we have a bunch of migration, that we have, you know, like, they may be predicting real things about the future, but when you think of their end goals, it's it's not necessarily something that everyone would agree on as a valuable way to live, you know? Yeah. It's just. invisible to them. And so, one of the techniques I'm trying to take is instead of just making this a philosophy, I want to see if we can make it a protocol. You know, right now, the internet is designed. It's a telecommunication system, right? As if communication is values neutral, and it's just bits and bites and words and sentences. That's it. But as people know, so much of communication has much more richness and depth, and so much of communication is invisible even to the person communicating it. Like, very few people have met a cognitive awareness. They operate from within themselves. They don't operate thinking, I was born in France. My mom beat me when I was a kid. I went to this school. I was told that I was very smart, I failed. You know, like, and then it shapes me like this, and this is why these things bother me and I like these things. Very few people think about why they behave and think the way they do. Of the inner. analyze the pattern and yeah. That's called meta cognitive awareness. The researchers say that. much in this. You are? Yeah. That's good. That's not bad. But it can prevent you from acting. Yeah. That's the next level. The next level is to bring these together. But it's very rare, actually. They say 2%, I forget, there's research on the different percentages of society that reach different stages. Maybe. I can show you. disease, but some kind of disabled thing, like, yeah, prevent you from acting or choosing or... Well, because it's scary to let go of what you think you know. It's destabilizing to start to think of yourself as a system, but it's also freeing. At the same time. So the way it works is when you're very young, you don't even know the thing in the mirror is you. you know? You are so inside of yourself, you can't even tell, it's a mirror, and that's looking at me. So when I move my hand, it will move its hand. And then that it's called the subjectjectjectation. So you are a subject, and that is an object. But when you can make more things, that is an object, and a subject, then you develop in your metacognitive awareness. So people are initially fused to their families. They think of themselves as a family, and there's other families. And then, it's called the socialcialized Mind. You think of yourself, and this is where clicks form in high school. You and your friends, and you're like a group, you know? And you kind of view things in these kind of tribal ways of like, me and my tribe, and maybe France or my society or even. Nord or something, you know? This is the socialized mind. And then usually after that, they call it the self authoring mind. It's the mind that says, oh, that's why I grew up like this. I can choose to be something else. Let me design a different way that I can live. And then the one after that is the self transforming, which is constantly evolving and changing and it has no fixed center anymore. Self authoring says, I'm a vegan. Self transforming says. I amm exploring my values in life and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just this is like the next stage that I'm trying to figure out right now are the the pre philosophy st stack. So there are people in the world that talk to trees. you know, that they hear the stars, you know? This is not weird for them. This is because they grew up in this way, their culture has, you know, deep histories with this kind of nature based conversation, like, this is a reality for some people. And then there are some people in the Buddhist tradition that achieve non dual states, you know? They don't see a difference between you and them. It's we call enlightenment. It's not a funny story. It's actually a reality for a subset of people. that makes me, you are like the drop of water that is like when you when you you get born, you. When you bloop and you have a little bubble. Yeah, you're a little. And when you go back in the ocean, you go back to welleness. But you can go back to oneness before letting go of your body.. Bef before your body is gone, you can already.. meditation go through through this meditative practice. And so there are these people that see this world, so differently, but we're all together in it. So my question is, can we find something that is similar and nonisputable? Just like, um, what's his name? B Descartes. I think, therefore, I am, right? And.. It's interesting because I think for him to say that already is a step too far. Like, this was the one foundational thing that he thought, because my senses can be deceived, you know, perception can be deceived. All of these things, are possibly a dream. So the only thing I know is that I'm a thinking being. And I think we can come up with something that is similar to that that can even be a union between West. So, I think, puts a bigI inside of this foundational thing. And individuated experience, whereas so Descartes would make no sense to a nonond dual person, you know? A non dual person, there's no \"I, and there might even not be so much thinking. And so.. The de Philos I think what there is is perception. This is something that until you die, there is perception. Uh, experience. And within experience, there is difference. I think these two, so far, I am fairly confident, I can say, is. an observable reality by anyone who thinks, feels, and experiences it directly. Like, there is perception, you're witnessing, even with your eyes closed, even in a century deprivation tank, there is awareness that... Even know what? Sensory deprivation tank. Yeah, I see.. There is an awareness. You did Not yet, still. Yeah. Even the slightest ripple, but you know that there is you and not you. There's something within this perception that has a relationship to movement that you can initiate, and there will be changes in the perceptual fields, like if your eyes are open, right? But then, I'm not making that leaf move. That leaf is moving. You know what it reminds me of? The movie Soul. Ah, yeah. It's It's kind of the same thing. Oh, yeah, but you spark. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.. Oh, and it's interesting, because in the movie that there there is no spark, right? In the end, it isn't that you find the spark. It's that you make it or something like that? Yeah, something like this. And, you know, the guy... dies and they are all on this bridge to the.. Yeah. Yeah. I don't remember all the details, but. Yeah. I remember the ideas. Yeah, it's interesting because I think I disagree at the end. Like.. Yeah.. I can agree with the first part, but I think they take the current subjective postmn perspective in the end, right? Like in the beginning, it's like, \"Oh, maybe music is my thing, you know? And then in the end, it's like, you decide, you know? I need to rewatch that. It's really understand. But this idea that you don't actually have control over what you find meaningful is important for me. Mm. That's, uh... That you discover what is meaningful for you, sort of like they were trying to do for the soul in the movie.. That you discover it, like, like you, you explored many different things, and then you found climbing. And you're like, wow, this is great, you know? You tried boxing or something, you tried other things. I made boxing.. I made boxing for almost five years, huh? And so it's important, like, so what you learn from this is there's actually something really important about a diversity of experiences. And trying things and exploring, and also being open to seeing what happens, you know? Maybe even going over a difficult period of learning to see if there's something else, and it's not that climbing is your spark, you know, or your meaning. It's that there's some things within it that we can formalize as meaningful for you. So it might be... freedom, a dynamics, constantly changing space where I get to explore my physical limits. Having a possibility for, like, developments, a companionship with others, you know, whatever, a mutual conversation about progress that connects me with people in a shared journey. Like, I can say, I did the blues, you know? And so it might not be climbing. as an idea, but it's these elements of. things that you can observe, that you are paying attention to. that matter to you, that Nature, freedom, creationships. Yeah. Seeing your growth, like, having a a playground, right, to explore your physical body or.. And it could be that if we try to analyze all of those things.... We could design a new experience for you that's as good as climbing or better. You know? I'd like to go to.. some, um places, uh. for climbing, like in Fontainebleau, it's. It’s important to know what’s meaningful for you so when you’re older you can adapt climbing towards the things that are meaningful when your body can’t do that anymore. It’s not the thing it’s the thing underneath it that makes it meaningful for you that you can watch your attention being drawn towards and your heart light up when you touch it ",

      "content": "Absolutely. Here is a **cohesive, stand-alone research proposal** that integrates the key insights from the conversation and the logic structure—while leaving \"Parliaments\" as an open design space, encouraging the researcher to explore new models.\n\n---\n\n# **Research Proposal: Toward a Participatory Science of Meaning**\n\n## **Title**  \n**“Toward a Science 2.0: Formalizing Inner Observation and Cross-Cultural Meaning Perception to Build an Epistemic Ground for Shared Human Futures”**\n\n---\n\n## **Abstract**  \nThis research explores how meaning—often dismissed as subjective or cultural noise—can be recognized as a real, inferable structure through shared human perception. We propose the development of a new scientific approach that treats inner experience as valid data. Drawing inspiration from cross-cultural moral responses, developmental psychology, and analogies in physical science (e.g., black holes inferred by surrounding patterns), we hypothesize that meaning perception is not arbitrary, but structurally shared. This Science 2.0 aims to design a protocol—perhaps digital, social, or conversational—that can gather and formalize inner data across philosophical and cultural boundaries without reducing diversity. It begins with minimal foundational axioms like “perception is happening” and seeks to evolve a participatory epistemology suited for our fragmented, technologically accelerated age.\n\n---\n\n## **Problem Statement**\n\nHumanity faces unprecedented collective challenges—climate change, technological disruption, societal fragmentation—while lacking a shared basis for moral reasoning and collective decision-making. Traditional science, shaped by materialist paradigms, often excludes inner experience and meaning perception as unmeasurable or untrustworthy.\n\nYet, across cultures and histories, we witness consistent emotional and ethical responses to events (e.g., natural disasters, compassionate figures). These suggest that beneath surface-level differences, humans may be perceiving something real—something not merely culturally constructed. However, no formal protocol exists to investigate this scientifically.\n\n---\n\n## **Research Question**  \n**How can we design a participatory scientific protocol—rooted in shared attentional patterns and relational dynamics—that reveals an underlying structure of meaning across cultures and worldviews, enabling us to formalize inner experience as valid epistemic data and develop a new science of value, perception, and truth?**\n\n---\n\n## **Supporting Questions**\n1. What minimal foundational agreements (e.g., “perception is happening,” “difference exists”) can serve as axioms for a cross-cultural, truth-oriented inquiry?\n2. How can we gather, interpret, and structure inner experience (e.g., tensions, values, meaning resonance) into data suitable for scientific and technological exploration?\n3. What structural features must Science 2.0 include to avoid the epistemic, economic, and ideological capture seen in earlier paradigms (e.g., Web 1.0, colonial science), while honoring Indigenous, Islamic, and nondual traditions?\n\n---\n\n## **Key Hypotheses**\n- Cross-cultural meaning responses suggest a real, shared moral and aesthetic substrate.\n- Meaning perception is not fully subjective but inferable—like a black hole—from patterns of resonance and behavior.\n- A new science can emerge from tracking inner data, structured through attentional dynamics, rather than physical measurement alone.\n- A minimal philosophical foundation can allow shared inquiry without requiring metaphysical agreement.\n\n---\n\n## **Methodological Sketch**\n\nThe research will include:\n- **Conceptual synthesis**: Reviewing philosophical stacks (ontology, epistemology, axiology) across cultures to identify minimum shared foundations.\n- **Design explorations**: Prototyping systems (digital or dialogical) that scaffold inner reflection and shared meaning perception without biasing results.\n- **Empirical studies**: Using qualitative and quantitative methods to test cross-cultural meaning perception (e.g., shared emotional resonance, attentional data tracking).\n- **Meta-cognitive frameworks**: Leveraging adult developmental theory to scaffold higher stages of self-awareness and collective sensemaking.\n\n---\n\n## **Theoretical Inspirations**\n- Developmental psychology (e.g., Kegan’s stages of mind)\n- Comparative philosophy (e.g., Islamic, Buddhist, Indigenous frameworks)\n- Phenomenology and embodied cognition\n- Complexity science and second-order cybernetics\n- Epistemic humility and value realism\n\n---\n\n## **Anticipated Outputs**\n- A schema of **minimal philosophical axioms** shared across traditions.\n- A **formal proposal** for a participatory protocol that gathers and structures inner experience.\n- A working **theoretical foundation** for a Science 2.0 that includes subjective experience without reducing it.\n- Design implications for education, policy, AI, and governance rooted in meaning-alignment rather than manipulation.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Reflection**\n\nJust as astronomers inferred black holes through patterns in surrounding movement, we may infer the reality of meaning and values through the patterned behavior of people across cultures. This proposal does not seek to define “truth” but to prove that *truth exists*—and that humans, though diverse, can align around its gravitational pull.\n\nThe work is both ancient and urgent: a science that can hold difference without collapsing into relativism or coercion, and a method for navigating the most significant questions of our time with clarity, depth, and shared care.\n\n---\n\nWould you like this proposal formatted for academic submission (e.g., as a PDF with references, a white paper, or editable markdown for collaboration)?",

      "content": "This is a critical question—and a powerful moment for refining your frame.\n\n### 1. **Does “meaning” adequately capture the terrain, or is “inner observation / inner knowing” better?**\n\n- **“Meaning perception”** is compelling because it:\n  - *Bridges emotion and cognition*: It is felt *and* understood.\n  - *Holds relationality*: Meaning arises in the space between the self and the world.\n  - *Aligns with moral and aesthetic experience*: It allows reference to ethics, beauty, and resonance.\n\n- However, it **risks being read as “subjective interpretation”**, especially by analytic philosophers or empirical scientists. “Meaning” can sound too interpretive, too unstable.\n\n- **“Inner observation”** shifts the emphasis:\n  - Towards a *method*: suggesting rigorous introspection or phenomenology.\n  - Towards *epistemic legitimacy*: it echoes phrases like “first-person data,” “phenomenological analysis,” and even “contemplative science.”\n  - Opens up the inclusion of *non-emotional knowledge*, such as moral clarity, intuition, conscience, spiritual states, or direct insight.\n\n- **“Inner knowing”** introduces:\n  - A **claim** to a kind of **truth-bearing perception**.\n  - But also **controversy**: epistemologists will ask “how do you verify it?”, neuroscientists may demand neural correlates, and others may confuse it with gut feeling or religious faith.\n\n### 2. **What might other researchers critique—and how might they improve it?**\n\nHere’s a structured map of probable feedback:\n\n| Discipline/Philosophy | Likely Critique | How They Might Improve It |\n|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Analytic Philosophy** | Vague definitions of “meaning” or “real”; lacks formal logic | Define axioms more rigorously; clarify semantics of \"real\" and \"truth\" |\n| **Phenomenologists** | Good direction, but lacks descriptive precision | Develop protocols for inner observation (e.g., Husserlian epoché) |\n| **Neuroscientists / Psychologists** | How is this falsifiable? How do you measure “inner data”? | Introduce methods like neurophenomenology or experience sampling |\n| **Anthropologists** | Risk of universalizing meaning across cultures | Emphasize local context and frame universality as *tendencies*, not absolutes |\n| **Contemplative Science (e.g., Varela, Lutz, Dahl)** | Strong alignment; would push for clear first-person methods | Collaborate to define training, attentional protocols, intersubjective checks |\n| **AI/Complexity Science** | Like the “protocol” idea; how will agents or systems use the data? | Create schemas for encoding inner states; define alignment metrics |\n| **Postmodern / Critical Theorists** | Risk of totalizing truth or ignoring power | Include reflexivity: who defines meaning? Whose values are validated? |\n\n### 3. **Should the Frame Shift?**\n\nHere are three versions of framing the proposal, each with different emphasis:\n\n#### **a. Meaning Perception** (current)\n- *Pros*: Emotionally resonant, morally compelling, relatable.\n- *Cons*: May be dismissed as interpretive or vague.\n\n#### **b. Inner Observation as Valid Epistemic Data**\n- *Pros*: Sharper claim; method-focused; opens scientific rigor.\n- *Cons*: Requires careful distinction from emotion, intuition, or belief.\n\n#### **c. Participatory Epistemology of Experience**\n- *Pros*: Frames this as a new kind of method for shared truth-seeking.\n- *Cons*: More abstract; needs grounding in concrete use cases.\n\n### 4. **Recommendation**\n\nFrame “meaning perception” as one **subset** of **inner observation**. Position your protocol as helping **formalize inner observation**—which includes:\n- Perception of meaning\n- Intuition or insight\n- Moral clarity\n- Aesthetic resonance\n- Conscience or gnosis\n\nThen, define a **taxonomy** that distinguishes:\n- **Emotional reaction** (transient, manipulable)\n- **Inner knowing** (stable, deeply felt, often cross-cultural)\n- **Introspective observation** (method-driven, reflectively aware)\n\nThis lets you speak to multiple audiences:\n- Scientists can focus on observation.\n- Philosophers can debate reality.\n- Technologists can work on protocol design.\n- Humanists can explore meaning.\n\n---\n\nWould you like help drafting this revised taxonomy and restructuring the abstract around “inner observation” rather than just “meaning”?",
