      "content": "For the competency \"Mobilising Others,\" which encompasses inspiring, engaging, and getting others on board through effective communication, persuasion, negotiation, and leadership, I'll create a table with two rows. The first row will contain questions for each of the five levels of depth: Inception & Exploration, Experimentation & Action, Skill Enhancement, Collaboration & Complexity, and Transformation & Innovation. The second row will suggest evidence for each level, ensuring it aligns with the threads of \"Inspire and Get Inspired,\" \"Persuade,\" and \"Communicate Effectively.\" Each piece of evidence will be unique and orthogonal to the others.\n\n| Level | Q Level 1: Inception & Exploration | Q Level 2: Experimentation & Action | Q Level 3: Skill Enhancement | Q Level 4: Collaboration & Complexity | Q Level 5: Transformation & Innovation |\n|-------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Questions for Mobilising Others** | How do you demonstrate enthusiasm for challenges and engage in value-creating activities? | How have you used arguments or evidence to persuade others in your initiatives? | How do you appeal to emotions or creatively communicate to inspire others? | How have you effectively pitched or communicated complex ideas to diverse groups, including potential investors or partners? | How do you form coalitions, inspire wide-scale action, and maintain momentum in challenging situations? |\n| **Evidence for Mobilising Others** | Descriptions or records of enthusiastic involvement and engagement in value-creating activities. | Documentation or examples of persuasive arguments supported by evidence in initiatives. | Creative presentations or communication materials that demonstrate an emotional appeal or imaginative approach. | Pitch materials, communication strategies, or feedback from diverse groups indicating effective persuasion and communication. | Strategic plans, coalition agreements, or records of sustained actions and momentum in challenging situations. |\n\nThis table is tailored to assess \"Mobilising Others\" across five levels, with each question designed to be comprehensive and straightforward to answer. The corresponding evidence is intended to be concrete, clearly demonstrating the individual's capabilities in each area.",
