      "content": "Based on your description – a bolete with a suede-like brown cap that stains blue when bruised and has yellow pores – you might be describing a mushroom from the genus *Boletus* or a closely related group. However, several boletes can stain blue and have brown caps, so it's important to provide more detailed information for a more accurate ID.\n\nSome possibilities include:\n\n1. **Boletus sensibilis**: Known to stain blue quickly when bruised, especially on the stem and cap. The cap is often reddish-brown, and the flesh, when cut or broken, turns blue. The spore print is olive-brown.\n2. **Boletus pseudosensibilis**: Similar to Boletus sensibilis but usually with a darker cap.\n3. **Boletus huronensis**: This is another blue-staining bolete that's similar in appearance to the others, but it has a very bitter taste which differentiates it from the rest.\n\nHowever, there are several other boletes with blue-staining properties, and this is just a small subset of the possibilities. \n\nPlease be cautious:\n- **Never consume any wild mushroom unless it's been positively identified as edible by an expert.** Some toxic mushrooms can look similar to edible ones.\n- Blue staining alone is not an indicator of edibility. Some blue-staining boletes are toxic and can cause gastrointestinal distress or other symptoms.\n\nIf you are considering consuming any wild mushroom, you should consult with local mycologists or experts, and it would be helpful to have multiple sources of confirmation for the identity of the mushroom. Consider joining a local mycological society, where you can go on forays and learn from experienced mushroom identifiers.",
