      "content": "I see the products in your photo — they’re all **drain cleaners** (déboucheurs), but there are a few differences:\n\n### Main options you have:\n1. **Spado Déboucheur WC**  \n   - Specifically for toilets (WC).  \n   - Formulated for heavy toilet blockages.  \n   - Not ideal for sinks or showers, since it’s harsher and tailored to larger pipes.\n\n2. **Ecogene W7 Désinfectant WC**  \n   - More of a disinfectant/cleaner (anti-odors, sanitation).  \n   - Not really a powerful unclogger.  \n   - Useful for cleaning but won’t clear hair/soap blockages.\n\n3. **Starwax Déboucheur Liquide Suractif (yellow bottle, 24% soude)**  \n   - A **liquid drain cleaner** with caustic soda (sodium hydroxide).  \n   - Good for moderate clogs (soap scum, grease, hair).  \n   - Flows easily into pipes.\n\n4. **Starwax Déboucheur Gel Surpuissant (purple bottle, 30% soude)**  \n   - A **thicker gel** that clings to pipes and sinks through standing water.  \n   - Stronger formula (30% caustic soda).  \n   - Better for tougher clogs, especially hair in bathroom sinks/showers.  \n\n---\n\n✅ **For your bathroom sink & shower:**  \n- Go with the **Starwax Gel Surpuissant (purple)**.  \n   - It’s designed to cut through hair and soap buildup (typical bathroom clog).  \n   - The gel consistency makes it more effective when water is sitting in the drain.  \n\n⚠️ Tips:  \n- Always wear gloves and eye protection (these are very caustic).  \n- Pour slowly, leave it to work (often 30 min to overnight depending on instructions).  \n- Flush well with hot water afterward.  \n- Don’t mix with other chemicals (like bleach).  \n\n👉 If the clog is **really stubborn** and comes back often, you may want to mechanically remove hair with a drain snake before/after using the chemical.  \n\nWould you like me to also explain a **non-chemical method** that might solve it more safely and cheaply (and avoid long-term pipe damage)?",

      "content": "You're asking whether the **Oro Débouch' Express** is essentially the same as **Starwax Gel Express**, but cheaper. Here's what web sources say:\n\n---\n\n###  **Similarity: Chemistry and Function**\n\n- **Starwax Gel Express** is a thick gel drain unblocker with a high sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) concentration (over 30%). It’s designed to cling to standing water and dissolve clogs—especially hair, soap, and grease—in just minutes.citeturn0search2turn0search8\n- The **Oro gel drain unblocker** (sold by Leroy Merlin) is also a sodium hydroxide-based gel that dissolves organic matter like hair, soap, and grease. It’s safe on enamel and plastic pipes, and works in standing water.citeturn0search5\n\nSo, both are **strong caustic gel formulas** intended for bathroom and kitchen clogs, and both act directly on the clog rather than just diluting into water.\n\n---\n\n###  **Price Difference**\n\n- **Oro gel**: Priced at **€3.99 per liter** at Leroy Merlin.citeturn0search5\n- **Starwax Gel Express**: Much more expensive—around **€10–€12 per liter**.citeturn0search2turn0search8\n\nClearly, the **Oro product** is significantly **cheaper per liter**, making it appealing from a budget standpoint.\n\n---\n\n###  **Bottom Line**\n\nBoth products are **chemically and functionally similar**, offering powerful, fast-acting gel formulas to unclog bathroom and kitchen drains. If you're comfortable using caustic gel cleaners, **Oro appears to offer equivalent performance at a much lower price**.\n\nThat said, since there's no direct side-by-side comparison from the manufacturers, subtle differences—like exact concentration, additives, or packaging—might exist. But for most household needs, **Oro offers great value**.\n\nWant help comparing application methods or safety tips between them?",

      "content": "Perfect close-up 👌 — let’s break these down:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Ecogene – Poudre Entretien Canalisation (white/green bottle)**\n- This is a **maintenance powder**.  \n- It helps deodorize, reduce grease/soap buildup, and prevent clogs.  \n- Best for **keeping drains clean**, **not for clearing an active clog**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Spado – Déboucheur Microbilles (red/blue bottle)**\n- Contains **caustic soda microbeads**.  \n- Designed for **tenacious clogs** in sinks, showers, and bathrooms.  \n- Microbeads react strongly with water, generating heat that helps dissolve soap, hair, grease.  \n- Works fast, but can be aggressive on pipes if used often.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Starwax – Déboucheur Microbilles Express (white/red bottle)**\n- Very similar to the Spado one: **microbeads of caustic soda**.  \n- “Express” formula — meant for **quick unclogging**.  \n- Works in standing water, dissolves hair and soap.  \n- Essentially a **different brand’s version** of Spado.\n\n---\n\n✅ **For your bathroom sink and shower:**  \n- Go with **Spado Microbilles** or **Starwax Microbilles Express** if you want a **fast, aggressive reaction**. They’re good for **hair + soap clogs** in bathroom drains.  \n- If your goal is **prevention/maintenance** (no real clog, just slow draining), then the **Ecogene powder** is gentler and safer.  \n\n⚠️ **Important:** Microbeads are very reactive.  \n- Always add slowly, avoid splashing.  \n- Never mix with other products (especially acids/bleach).  \n- Rinse well with lots of hot water afterward.  \n\n---\n\n👉 Compared with the **gel formulas** (like Starwax Gel Surpuissant or Oro Débouch’ Express), these **microbeads act faster but are harsher**. Gels cling better and are often safer for bathroom drains that clog with hair.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to **rank gels vs microbeads** for your bathroom specifically (hair + soap clogs) so you know which is safest and most effective?",
